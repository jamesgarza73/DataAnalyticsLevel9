      "body": "<p>The government's intention may be good, but the news that the Department of Health has told internet providers they could be prosecuted for relaying information that breaks British adoption rules was last night greeted with scepticism and cynicism. </p> <p>Leading industry figures and experts believe that the nature and scale of the internet, as well as the status of those who provide access to the web, will make it impossible to enforce the rule. </p> <p>They also point to a European directive, expected to come into force in Britain in the next two years, which defines internet service providers (ISPs) merely as conduits for information who cannot be responsible for content. This rule would seem to contradict the warning. </p> <p>The Department of Health also came under fire for failing to consult the industry properly before sounding its warning and it is bound to be heavily criticised by civil liberties campaigners who will see the development as another attack on free speech. </p> <p>ISPs have three main functions. They provide access to the web, so theoretically they could stop particular sites being reached. But they say that would not be feasible as it would require almost unlimited resources. And banning a site would give it notoriety prompting many more people to look at it. The British government also cannot try to shut down a foreign website at source because it would have no jurisdiction to do so. </p> <p>The second main function of the ISPs is to provide \"hosted web space\" for websites. ISPs do have more control here, but even a small website may have 20 pages. So if an ISP hosted just 100 websites, it would have 2,000 pages to monitor. </p> <p>Third, the ISPs provide news groups, or bulletin boards where articles can be posted. An article posted with an ISP's news group - for example, on adoption - will be picked up by linked news groups run by other ISPs worldwide. Checking everything on the news groups would be impossible. </p> <p>What will particularly annoy the ISPs about the government's warning is that they are considered world leaders in self-regulation. ISPs are not licensed and do not have to register anywhere. But about 130 internet firms in the UK are members of the Internet Services Providers Association, which has been at great pains to provide a code of practice aimed at addressing the problem of illegal material. Formed in 1996, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) also works with the internet companies, the police and government, to tackle problems such as child pornography sites. </p> <p>There appears to have been little consultation between the Department of Health and the industry. The IWF heard about what was afoot only when officials from other government departments began ringing it late last week. </p> <p>Both the IWF and ISPA believe that the Department of Health's approach is flawed. </p> <p>David Kerr, IWF's chief executive, said: \"I think it's been generally accepted by ministers and the police that internet service providers don't and can't be expected to know what's on their servers. The department seems to be ignoring this basic point. This tactic is very unlikely to work and will put the department in conflict with the industry in the UK and in the rest of the world.\" </p> <p>Mr Kerr said the industry had tried to stop material appearing on the web which would be illegal to publish in other forms in the UK - for example, child and extreme adult pornography.

      "bodyText": "The government's intention may be good, but the news that the Department of Health has told internet providers they could be prosecuted for relaying information that breaks British adoption rules was last night greeted with scepticism and cynicism. Leading industry figures and experts believe that the nature and scale of the internet, as well as the status of those who provide access to the web, will make it impossible to enforce the rule. They also point to a European directive, expected to come into force in Britain in the next two years, which defines internet service providers (ISPs) merely as conduits for information who cannot be responsible for content. This rule would seem to contradict the warning. The Department of Health also came under fire for failing to consult the industry properly before sounding its warning and it is bound to be heavily criticised by civil liberties campaigners who will see the development as another attack on free speech. ISPs have three main functions. They provide access to the web, so theoretically they could stop particular sites being reached. But they say that would not be feasible as it would require almost unlimited resources. And banning a site would give it notoriety prompting many more people to look at it. The British government also cannot try to shut down a foreign website at source because it would have no jurisdiction to do so. The second main function of the ISPs is to provide \"hosted web space\" for websites. ISPs do have more control here, but even a small website may have 20 pages. So if an ISP hosted just 100 websites, it would have 2,000 pages to monitor. Third, the ISPs provide news groups, or bulletin boards where articles can be posted. An article posted with an ISP's news group - for example, on adoption - will be picked up by linked news groups run by other ISPs worldwide. Checking everything on the news groups would be impossible. What will particularly annoy the ISPs about the government's warning is that they are considered world leaders in self-regulation. ISPs are not licensed and do not have to register anywhere. But about 130 internet firms in the UK are members of the Internet Services Providers Association, which has been at great pains to provide a code of practice aimed at addressing the problem of illegal material. Formed in 1996, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) also works with the internet companies, the police and government, to tackle problems such as child pornography sites. There appears to have been little consultation between the Department of Health and the industry. The IWF heard about what was afoot only when officials from other government departments began ringing it late last week. Both the IWF and ISPA believe that the Department of Health's approach is flawed. David Kerr, IWF's chief executive, said: \"I think it's been generally accepted by ministers and the police that internet service providers don't and can't be expected to know what's on their servers. The department seems to be ignoring this basic point. This tactic is very unlikely to work and will put the department in conflict with the industry in the UK and in the rest of the world.\" Mr Kerr said the industry had tried to stop material appearing on the web which would be illegal to publish in other forms in the UK - for example, child and extreme adult pornography. Although ISPs cannot monitor all the material passing through, once they are told about such material, they can remove it. But another huge complication is the status of the ISPs. Many argue that they are not publishers but facilitators. The possible counter-argument, that they are indeed publishers because they own the servers carrying the material, has not been explored in the courts. There are few precedents. Last year a New York lawyer sued the net firm Prodigy after an impostor sent obscene messages purporting to come from his 15-year-old son. The state's highest court threw out the claim, arguing that \"an ISP, like a telephone company, is merely a conduit\", and was backed by the supreme court. Here, however, Mr Justice Morland decided in the high court that the internet company Demon Internet was liable for defamatory comments published about the physicist Laurence Godfrey - whose argument was that the ISP had become a publisher when it did not remove the comments. Campaigners for free speech point out that some British ISPs now remove a comment, however fair and legitimate, as soon as they get a complaint rather than risk being sued. Speaking after the Godfrey case, Mark Stephens, a media lawyer and vice-chair of the IWF, anticipated a flurry of litigation unless the laws were clarified. \"In America ISPs have immunity over the content they provide access to and that must be the situation here. Otherwise, you'll have a legal free-for-all with libel writs flying left, right and centre.\" He was right.

By the end, after this dose of stark reality, the Sunderland fans trudged home in chilled frustration. </p> <p>Sunderland have not lost at the Stadium of Light since Bradford City won here in April. Fifteen teams have come and gone since but City, who had not conceded on three previous visits to this stadium, should have ended that sequence yesterday. Early in the second half Dean Windass, unmarked at the far post, speared Robbie Blake's low cross wide of an open goal. With Windass's cheeks still burning, Thomas Sorensen was forced to tip Blake's vicious shot over seconds later. </p> <p>\"I think Dean was reading the headlines before he put it in,\" said the Bradford manager Jim Jefferies ruefully. \"We could have sneaked it, but it was a good solid performance. They gave us a real pasting at our place on Boxing Day and we changed things around after that.

      "bodyText": "A record crowd swarmed to Wearmouth, flicking through their fanzine Champions League pull-outs and buzzing at the prospect of a spanking of the bottom club. By the end, after this dose of stark reality, the Sunderland fans trudged home in chilled frustration. Sunderland have not lost at the Stadium of Light since Bradford City won here in April. Fifteen teams have come and gone since but City, who had not conceded on three previous visits to this stadium, should have ended that sequence yesterday. Early in the second half Dean Windass, unmarked at the far post, speared Robbie Blake's low cross wide of an open goal. With Windass's cheeks still burning, Thomas Sorensen was forced to tip Blake's vicious shot over seconds later. \"I think Dean was reading the headlines before he put it in,\" said the Bradford manager Jim Jefferies ruefully. \"We could have sneaked it, but it was a good solid performance. They gave us a real pasting at our place on Boxing Day and we changed things around after that. This was a benchmark of how much we have improved.\" Sunderland, still two points ahead of Arsenal in second place, have mounted their unlikely European challenge by instilling resilience and an unflappable work ethic throughout a talented, if underrated, squad.

Since his arrival Boro are unbeaten in eight games and, even more significantly, have shipped only two goals - a penalty and an own-goal at that. \" We have tried to get solid. We worked on the defence, now I'm moving through the team,\" said Venables. A mean team is always hard to beat, so Middlesbrough's short-term future appears secure. But, with Venables still enamoured of the studio lights, he may find greasepaint altogether more alluring than warpaint. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>Hi Sam, </p> <p> I was just returning from <strong>Australia</strong> about this time last year. I spent three amazing months on the east coast between Sydney and Cairns. I know you don't have that long in Australia, but here a a few things which I enjoyed. </p> <p> In <strong>Sydney</strong> I stayed in the YHA by the central station - very nice, but as it's massive it's a bit on the impersonal side - unless you end up in a room with like-minded people. I did the most amazing five day 'learn to surf' trip with Aussie Surf Adventures run by Nat and Dan, up to Byron Bay. Five days of surfing, eating, surfing, drinking, surfing and a bit of partying thrown in. Highly recommended, even though surfing is a bit like being in a washing machine. </p> <p> <strong>Byron Bay</strong> is a must - loads of hostels to choose from, but the best by far is Aquarius. There are loads of things to do in Byron Bay - I had to drag myself away - but one thing you have to try is sea kayaking with dolphins. Two other things that you really should try and do are a two or three day boat trip out to the Whitsunday Islands and a three day four-wheel-drive safari on Fraser Island - the biggest sand island in the world.

      "bodyText": "Hi Sam, I was just returning from Australia about this time last year. I spent three amazing months on the east coast between Sydney and Cairns. I know you don't have that long in Australia, but here a a few things which I enjoyed. In Sydney I stayed in the YHA by the central station - very nice, but as it's massive it's a bit on the impersonal side - unless you end up in a room with like-minded people. I did the most amazing five day 'learn to surf' trip with Aussie Surf Adventures run by Nat and Dan, up to Byron Bay. Five days of surfing, eating, surfing, drinking, surfing and a bit of partying thrown in. Highly recommended, even though surfing is a bit like being in a washing machine. Byron Bay is a must - loads of hostels to choose from, but the best by far is Aquarius. There are loads of things to do in Byron Bay - I had to drag myself away - but one thing you have to try is sea kayaking with dolphins. Two other things that you really should try and do are a two or three day boat trip out to the Whitsunday Islands and a three day four-wheel-drive safari on Fraser Island - the biggest sand island in the world. One piece of advice - only swim in the fresh water inland lakes, as there are tiger sharks in the sea which wait in the shallows waiting for a tourist to dip in their big toe. Take a boogie board to slid down the sand dunes - if you do you will boost your popularity ratings by far! You could give Cairns a miss - not much there - but it is an outpost to Cape Tribulation ' where the reef meets the rainforest'. Fantastic place to chill out and relax. Hope you have a good trip and enjoy it all. Alex",

Christie Chan, who set up her website in October 1999, has been contacted by Warner Brothers's legal team demanding that she surrender the site's name. In a defiant move against Warner Brothers - the company that owns film and merchandising rights to Harry Potter - Miss Chan is standing her ground. So far, Warners has not threatened to take Miss Chan to court, as she had complied with some of their requests to credit images to the entertainment giant. Nevertheless, Miss Chan has gone on record in the Asian press, voicing her concerns that one day she will be forced to close down \"because other fairly well-established sites have shut down due to notices from Warner Brothers\". The latest domain name dispute is almost a carbon copy of a case in December when 15-year-old Brit Claire Field received a letter from Warner Brothers's London legal department asking her to hand over the name www.harrypotterguide.co.uk. Like her dragon-defying idol, the British youth rebelled and gained the support of other Harry Potter fan sites around the world. The publicity gained by Miss Field eventually led to Warner Brothers granting her permission to keep the website although she had to make a number of changes. Her website now states on its opening page that it is an \"unofficial Harry Potter site\" with no connections to JK Rowling, Warner Brothers, or the books publishers.

Honest Abe follows the fortunes of a nice guy whose principles and beliefs are questioned when he is elected to run for state Governor. It is rumoured that the \u00a330m (\u00a320.48m) film will be in the style of Frank Capra's 1939 classic Mr Smith Goes to Washington. Sources close to Capra-fan Crowe claim that he has been looking for just such a script with a 'lighter touch\" after his rough and ready role in Gladiator.

According to reports, Damon has bought the rights to sportswriter Maury Allen's memoirs All Roads Lead to October which chronicles the highs and lows of the New York Yankees.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Russell Crowe (pictured) and Kevin Spacey are both competing for the same role in a new Disney comedy drama, according to Ananova. Honest Abe follows the fortunes of a nice guy whose principles and beliefs are questioned when he is elected to run for state Governor. It is rumoured that the \u00a330m (\u00a320.48m) film will be in the style of Frank Capra's 1939 classic Mr Smith Goes to Washington. Sources close to Capra-fan Crowe claim that he has been looking for just such a script with a 'lighter touch\" after his rough and ready role in Gladiator. The smart money, however, is on double Oscar winner Spacey, soon to be seen in Pay it Forward, as Disney executives believe he is \"more suitable.\" \u0095 Hollywood buddies Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are set to team up again for a new baseball film about a real-life wife-swapping scandal. According to reports, Damon has bought the rights to sportswriter Maury Allen's memoirs All Roads Lead to October which chronicles the highs and lows of the New York Yankees. However, Damon is planning to focus only on the chapter which recounts the exploits of team-mates Fritz Peterson and Mike Kekick.

      "body": "<p>There are lots of things British fans find hard to understand about Italian football. There's the caginess of the tactics for a start, while the willingness to spend millions of pounds on Karel Poborksy is another. But the most baffling thing of all must surely be this concept of a \"title race\". What exactly does it mean?</p> <p>Well, after poring over this morning's league table, things become slightly clearer. It appears that a title race is when you have more than one team that could win the league. Roma are at the top of Serie A, like Manchester United are top of the Premiership, but they only lead the table by three points, with Juventus, and Dino Zoff's Lazio, breathing down their necks.</p> <p>Fans of competition have Alberto Zaccheroni's AC Milan to thank. The Rossoneri ran out 3-2 victors against Roma at the San Siro last night, with two goals from Andrei Shevchenko taking the Ukranian back to his traditional place at the top of the Serie A scoring charts. </p> <p>Leonardo gave the home side the lead after just three minutes, curling a free-kick past Cristiano Lupatelli from 25 yards. 18 minutes later Shevchenko took advantage of a malfunctioning offside trap to latch on to Demetrio Albertini's through-ball before beating Lupatelli for their second.</p> <p>This sparked Roma into life, and Fabio Capello's side enjoyed their best spell of the match. But, with Gabriel Batistuta strangely wasteful in front of goal, they could only claim one back, through Francesco Totti's deflected strike. </p> <p>That was all the encouragement Shevchenko needed, and the Ukrainian duly scored his 13th goal of the season a minute before half-time. A Totti penalty, late in the second half, reduced the final deficit.</p> <p>Capello remained upbeat after the match. \"I'm happy,\" he claimed. \"Not with the result, but with the way my team played, and not only in the second half.\" </p> <p>Taking a leaf out of the Massimo Taibi handbook, Capello went on to blame his team's studs for their poor first-half showing. \"We didn't have the right studs for the pitch,\" he said. \"I saw Gabriel Batistuta miss a great chance to score with his head because he slipped as he jumped. During the second half we changed our attitude, but our studs as well.\"</p> <p>By contrast, Milan boss Alberto Zaccheroni was all doom and gloom. \"This win has changed nothing between Milan and me,\" said the man tipped for the exit door at Milan this summer. \"The players didn't play for anybody but themselves, and they didn't play for Zaccheroni. They played for themselves, and, after two points from their last four matches, they had to win at all costs.\" </p> <p><strong>Juve keep up the hunt</strong></p> <p>Juventus took full advantage of Roma's slip (without or without the studs) with a 1-0 away win over Perugia. Filippo Inzaghi's finish from a inspired pass by Edgar Davids was enough to see off the team who deprived them of the Scudetto on the final day of last season, and extend their unbeaten run to 11 league matches.</p> <p>Several great saves from Perugia keeper Andrea Mazzantini kept the score down, which is more than can be said for the contents of Paolo Montero's stomach. The giant Uruguayan defender delayed the start of the second half by spewing in the centre circle. Montero played on and completed the match (picking up a customary yellow card) but the number of sliding tackles in around the centre spot has yet to be confirmed.</p> <p><strong>Lazio are go</strong></p> <p>The Saturday evening match saw Lazio's post-Sven-Goran Eriksson bounce continue at the expense of Internazionale (no real surprise, surely). Choosing to pair Hernan Crespo with Marcelo Salas, Dino Zoff's selection paid off as early as the fifth minute. A cross from Pavel Nedved was flicked on by Salas and Crespo arrived to do what he does best, turning the ball past Sebastien Frey from 10 yards. </p> <p>Lazio were in charge of the match from then on, and in a dominant second half had a number of chances. Most prominent in these attacking thrusts was the aforementioned Czech Express (or whatever they call him) Karel Poborsky, and his tumble in the box in the 78th minute was rewarded with a penalty which Salas stepped up to take. He duly converted and put the game beyond Marco Tardelli's side.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There are lots of things British fans find hard to understand about Italian football. There's the caginess of the tactics for a start, while the willingness to spend millions of pounds on Karel Poborksy is another. But the most baffling thing of all must surely be this concept of a \"title race\". What exactly does it mean? Well, after poring over this morning's league table, things become slightly clearer. It appears that a title race is when you have more than one team that could win the league. Roma are at the top of Serie A, like Manchester United are top of the Premiership, but they only lead the table by three points, with Juventus, and Dino Zoff's Lazio, breathing down their necks. Fans of competition have Alberto Zaccheroni's AC Milan to thank. The Rossoneri ran out 3-2 victors against Roma at the San Siro last night, with two goals from Andrei Shevchenko taking the Ukranian back to his traditional place at the top of the Serie A scoring charts. Leonardo gave the home side the lead after just three minutes, curling a free-kick past Cristiano Lupatelli from 25 yards. 18 minutes later Shevchenko took advantage of a malfunctioning offside trap to latch on to Demetrio Albertini's through-ball before beating Lupatelli for their second. This sparked Roma into life, and Fabio Capello's side enjoyed their best spell of the match. But, with Gabriel Batistuta strangely wasteful in front of goal, they could only claim one back, through Francesco Totti's deflected strike. That was all the encouragement Shevchenko needed, and the Ukrainian duly scored his 13th goal of the season a minute before half-time. A Totti penalty, late in the second half, reduced the final deficit. Capello remained upbeat after the match. \"I'm happy,\" he claimed. \"Not with the result, but with the way my team played, and not only in the second half.\" Taking a leaf out of the Massimo Taibi handbook, Capello went on to blame his team's studs for their poor first-half showing. \"We didn't have the right studs for the pitch,\" he said. \"I saw Gabriel Batistuta miss a great chance to score with his head because he slipped as he jumped. During the second half we changed our attitude, but our studs as well.\" By contrast, Milan boss Alberto Zaccheroni was all doom and gloom. \"This win has changed nothing between Milan and me,\" said the man tipped for the exit door at Milan this summer. \"The players didn't play for anybody but themselves, and they didn't play for Zaccheroni. They played for themselves, and, after two points from their last four matches, they had to win at all costs.\" Juve keep up the hunt Juventus took full advantage of Roma's slip (without or without the studs) with a 1-0 away win over Perugia. Filippo Inzaghi's finish from a inspired pass by Edgar Davids was enough to see off the team who deprived them of the Scudetto on the final day of last season, and extend their unbeaten run to 11 league matches. Several great saves from Perugia keeper Andrea Mazzantini kept the score down, which is more than can be said for the contents of Paolo Montero's stomach. The giant Uruguayan defender delayed the start of the second half by spewing in the centre circle. Montero played on and completed the match (picking up a customary yellow card) but the number of sliding tackles in around the centre spot has yet to be confirmed. Lazio are go The Saturday evening match saw Lazio's post-Sven-Goran Eriksson bounce continue at the expense of Internazionale (no real surprise, surely). Choosing to pair Hernan Crespo with Marcelo Salas, Dino Zoff's selection paid off as early as the fifth minute. A cross from Pavel Nedved was flicked on by Salas and Crespo arrived to do what he does best, turning the ball past Sebastien Frey from 10 yards. Lazio were in charge of the match from then on, and in a dominant second half had a number of chances. Most prominent in these attacking thrusts was the aforementioned Czech Express (or whatever they call him) Karel Poborsky, and his tumble in the box in the 78th minute was rewarded with a penalty which Salas stepped up to take. He duly converted and put the game beyond Marco Tardelli's side.",

The Archbishop of Canterbury has joined forces with the Roman Catholic archbishops of Glasgow and Westminster, the Chief Rabbi and the President of the Muslim College to protest at changes to the law which will allow testing on stem cells derived from the cloning of human embryos. In an open letter which was sent to all peers, the religious leaders said the proposals deserved to be examined in more detail than than that allowed by a brief parliamentary debate. The Archbishop of Westminster, the Most Rev Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, said that the research had disturbing implications. \"Firstly this is using human life as disposable organic matter, and it is certainly the Catholic church's view that the human embryo from the very beginning has unlimited respect and protection,\" he said. \"And it is unnecessary.

      "body": "<p><strong>KAN I BUILD IT (A SMALL HOUSE IN THE NORTH OF ENGLAND THAT IS)?</strong></p> <p>If you're a bear or a tortoise and have been hibernating for the past few months, you may have missed Frederic Kanoute's goalscoring form for West Ham. In fact, if you are a bear then you should probably still be asleep, so apologies for any disturbance. The point is that Freddie K has been good - really good - for something approaching a third of a season. Which means he's fully justified in talking up a move away from the club he joined only last summer, isn't he?</p> <p>\"When you are in a big team like Arsenal or Manchester United the selectors see you all the time,\" Kanoute told the Mirror this morning (in an interview sponsored, for some reason, by a power company). \"As soon as I get into that team, the selectors will look at me. Sometimes you have to move to get noticed.\" </p> <p>Now, while it would obviously be the selectors' fault if Freddie left Upton Park, the 24-year-old still felt the need to issue a quick website-based statement this afternoon (sponsored by his official website) to assure Hammers fans that he's staying. Sort of. \"It's nice to think that such big sides are interested in me - it's an honour. But I must forget about that,\" he said, as if he was Nigel Lythgoe thanking that fat Scottish singer for turning up.</p> <p>So Freddie is staying at West Ham forever. Which must be some relief to him, because he's unlikely to survive if he ever ventures north of Watford. Explaining that the sort of big clubs he was interested in basically amounted to Arsenal and Manchester United, Kanoute observed: \"I don't really like the north. It's always cold, it's always raining, and I don't like all those little houses.\" Which means he can't have looked around Upton Park recently. Or found Manchester on a map. But, apart from that, good work Fred.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>HIS LAME IS RIO</strong></p> <p>Getting up and being active is never easy if you spend most of your life slumped in front of the television. For example, the Fiver's weekend consisted of draping ourselves over the sofa drinking fizzy pop (bad), smoking tabs (extremely bad) and eating kebabs (healthier than pizza), and as a result we're in no shape to play a full 90 minutes of football. Having said that, we could just about manage ten if we didn't leave the centre circle - and that's more than you'll get from telly addict Rio Ferdinand at the moment.</p> <p>\"It was freak accident and typical of this season,\" said David O'Leary O'Leeds this afternoon, as he patiently waited for his voice to be drowned out by chortles of varying pitch and volume. \"Rio was watching television and had his foot up on the coffee table. He had it there in a certain position for a number of hours, then he gets up and he's strained a tendon behind his knee.\"</p> <p>Before O'Leary could tell us that Rio is likely to miss the midweek game against Aston Villa but should be back for next Saturday's FA Cup tie with Liverpool, thoughts had drifted elsewhere. After all, wasn't it Rio's team-mate Robbie Keane who once ruptured knee ligaments upon bending down to pick up a remote? And didn't David Seaman, who must have played against Rio or Robbie at some point, break a bone in his foot performing a similar act? Why, it must be a curse! Ban this evil menace now!</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I'm listening to my body.

If you're a bear or a tortoise and have been hibernating for the past few months, you may have missed Frederic Kanoute's goalscoring form for West Ham. In fact, if you are a bear then you should probably still be asleep, so apologies for any disturbance. The point is that Freddie K has been good - really good - for something approaching a third of a season. Which means he's fully justified in talking up a move away from the club he joined only last summer, isn't he? \"When you are in a big team like Arsenal or Manchester United the selectors see you all the time,\" Kanoute told the Mirror this morning (in an interview sponsored, for some reason, by a power company). \"As soon as I get into that team, the selectors will look at me. Sometimes you have to move to get noticed.\" Now, while it would obviously be the selectors' fault if Freddie left Upton Park, the 24-year-old still felt the need to issue a quick website-based statement this afternoon (sponsored by his official website) to assure Hammers fans that he's staying. Sort of. \"It's nice to think that such big sides are interested in me - it's an honour. But I must forget about that,\" he said, as if he was Nigel Lythgoe thanking that fat Scottish singer for turning up. So Freddie is staying at West Ham forever. Which must be some relief to him, because he's unlikely to survive if he ever ventures north of Watford. Explaining that the sort of big clubs he was interested in basically amounted to Arsenal and Manchester United, Kanoute observed: \"I don't really like the north. It's always cold, it's always raining, and I don't like all those little houses.\" Which means he can't have looked around Upton Park recently. Or found Manchester on a map. But, apart from that, good work Fred. * * * * * * * * * * * * * HIS LAME IS RIO Getting up and being active is never easy if you spend most of your life slumped in front of the television. For example, the Fiver's weekend consisted of draping ourselves over the sofa drinking fizzy pop (bad), smoking tabs (extremely bad) and eating kebabs (healthier than pizza), and as a result we're in no shape to play a full 90 minutes of football. Having said that, we could just about manage ten if we didn't leave the centre circle - and that's more than you'll get from telly addict Rio Ferdinand at the moment. \"It was freak accident and typical of this season,\" said David O'Leary O'Leeds this afternoon, as he patiently waited for his voice to be drowned out by chortles of varying pitch and volume. \"Rio was watching television and had his foot up on the coffee table. He had it there in a certain position for a number of hours, then he gets up and he's strained a tendon behind his knee.\" Before O'Leary could tell us that Rio is likely to miss the midweek game against Aston Villa but should be back for next Saturday's FA Cup tie with Liverpool, thoughts had drifted elsewhere. After all, wasn't it Rio's team-mate Robbie Keane who once ruptured knee ligaments upon bending down to pick up a remote? And didn't David Seaman, who must have played against Rio or Robbie at some point, break a bone in his foot performing a similar act? Why, it must be a curse! Ban this evil menace now! * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I'm listening to my body. Something has to give and it has to be the internationals\" - Tony Adams announces his retirement from international football. His body was unavailable for comment. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NOT MUCH ADO ABOUT SOMETHING [Scene: A training field, somewhere near the Riverside stadium this morning. Standing in the field are two figures, one in a three-quarter-length leather jacket, the other in a big sheepskin coat and chatting on a mobile. Two more men arrive, both with silver hair, wearing glasses and sensible winter jackets. They are both smiling politely. The man in the sheepskin coat goes over to them and offers his hand as if to shake, before pulling it away at the last minute] TEL (yes, that's right): Allo Sven. I'm Terry, but you can call me Terry. I used to manage England, got 'em to the semi-finals of Euro 96. English through and through me. SVEN: That's very good, yes. And who is? [Sven points in the direction of the leather-jacketed man] TEL: That's Robbo. Say 'ello Robbo. ROBBO: 'ello Robbo. SVEN: This is Tord. [Points to other well-dressed Scandinavian] Tel, I am here to be packing your brains about the big job. Do you have any tips? TEL: Yeah, pick Incey, he's brilliant. ROBBO: Pick Incey, he's brilliant. TEL: And Ugo Ehiogu. ROBBO: Ugo. SVEN: Yes, that's very good. But do you not have anything you want to say about the job, the pressures of creating a tight-knit group of players in such a short space of time? TEL: No, and if you don't sling your Swedish [another man appears in the field. He is a reporter for Middlesbrough's official website] REPORTER: Mr Sven, Mr Sven, do you have anything to say to our readers that will be repeated first by other websites, then the TV, and then the next day by the papers? SVEN: \"I feel at home everywhere. It's perfect, wonderful. There are many good players and I will try now to see as many as possible and try to talk to as many managers as possible before the first friendly game we have in February. Terry is an extremely good manager. He has done the work before me and it's very important that I have a good relationship with him.\" Will that do? REPORTER: Thank you Mr Sven, thank you.

TEL: Well, I just happen to know this fella [SVEN heads off to a helicopter parked nearby, while TORD can be seen explaining the finer points of catenaccio to ROBBO with a series of flash cards] * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Reports in France suggest that Liverpool are close to agreeing a \u00a37m deal with Paris St Germain striker Christian. Manchester United are looking at Henrik Larsson as a replacement for Teddy Sheringham. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF West Ham are close to signing Bulgarian forward Svetoslav Todorov from Lovech in a \u00a3500,000 deal which will rise to up to \u00a32m depending on appearances. Carl Asaba is set to complete a \u00a3750,000 move from Gillingham to Crystal Palace. Newcastle midfielder Kieron Dyer has been given the all-clear to resume training after undergoing tests on what was believed to be a serious shin splints problem. \"All tests have shown no serious problem at the present time,\" a club spokesman said today. He is expected to be fit to play next week.\" Liverpool are facing a striking mini-crisis with both Michael Owen and Emile Heskey injured. Owen has had a precautionary scan on his right hamstring and could be ruled out for two weeks, while Heskey is likely to be out for a week with a thigh injury. Everton midfielder Paul Gascoigne is out for another month after suffering a recurrence of the thigh muscle tear that has already ruled him out since November 5. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: Football Extra (1.30am) [rustle, bang, clank] Channel 5: Argentine Football (3.55am) Ssh!

      "body": "<p>The fact that First Tuesday, the corporate matchmaking club, may have already held the last of its flagship monthly meetings is certainly something of a symbolic event in the brief, traumatic life of British e-commerce, if not a seismic one. </p> <p>First Tuesday, like so much of the dot.com world, shone brightly at the height of net mania in 1999, with an incredible, buzzing atmosphere which made the onlooker feel like a little bit of Silicon Valley had been brought over to central London.</p> <p>But First Tuesday quickly fell victim to the dot.com greed it helped to spawn. By this time last year venture capitalists (VCs) - the monied half of the First Tuesday equation - were beginning to complain that good ideas were thin on the ground at the monthly networking meetings. A regional network of meetings, after a bright start, failed to recreate the kind of buzz found at the London events. From its estimated peak value of \u00a336m last summer, the company is now reportedly up for sale again, for \u00a32m.</p> <p>By that time word had spread the nation over that First Tuesday was the place to sweet talk some city whiz kid into handing over millions for your half baked dot.com idea. Likely lads descended; there were tales of people even pretending to be VCs, out to steal the latest hot dot.com ideas.</p> <p>At the same time technology stocks were plunging, venture capitalists were taking fright, and the party fell flat, not helped by attempts by First Tuesday to grab a little bit of the money itself by charging a levy on VC payouts.</p> <p>But we can safely ignore some comments from unnamed VCs that, as deep into net history as 18 months ago, they felt it was all a bit naff - that would place us in mid-1999, when First Tuesday was in its heyday. The first balmy Tuesday evening in August that year saw the event - held at Home House in London - thrice over-subscribed. The money men were flocking in, lured by the promise of a fast buck.</p> <p>Perhaps the most attractive, most net-like aspect of the First Tuesday concept was its apparent democracy: the notion that any decent idea could be a goer, given a sharp enough line in sales patter and a bit of luck in meeting a willing VC. The mystery was being removed from venture funding, always more scarce in the UK than in the US.</p> <p>The businesses those nights spawned, however, reads today a bit like a who's who of so what: ClickMango, which went bust last autumn after barely mustering the turnover of a corner shop, was one of the most obvious failures. Others - like music site peoplesound and ihavemoved.com - the site that tells your friends you've moved - have yet to prove they have anything to offer that will allow them to stand out. Moreover.com, the news aggregator, is perhaps the shining alum of First Tuesday - and it was started by the club's co-founder, Nick Denton. </p> <p>In these austere days, with their multimillion pound judgements being proved wrong again and again, we should expect the VCs to feign casual indifference towards First Tuesday. But let's not forget they were looking pretty keen in 1999, in the middle of the feeding frenzy.

      "bodyText": "The fact that First Tuesday, the corporate matchmaking club, may have already held the last of its flagship monthly meetings is certainly something of a symbolic event in the brief, traumatic life of British e-commerce, if not a seismic one. First Tuesday, like so much of the dot.com world, shone brightly at the height of net mania in 1999, with an incredible, buzzing atmosphere which made the onlooker feel like a little bit of Silicon Valley had been brought over to central London. But First Tuesday quickly fell victim to the dot.com greed it helped to spawn. By this time last year venture capitalists (VCs) - the monied half of the First Tuesday equation - were beginning to complain that good ideas were thin on the ground at the monthly networking meetings. A regional network of meetings, after a bright start, failed to recreate the kind of buzz found at the London events. From its estimated peak value of \u00a336m last summer, the company is now reportedly up for sale again, for \u00a32m. By that time word had spread the nation over that First Tuesday was the place to sweet talk some city whiz kid into handing over millions for your half baked dot.com idea. Likely lads descended; there were tales of people even pretending to be VCs, out to steal the latest hot dot.com ideas. At the same time technology stocks were plunging, venture capitalists were taking fright, and the party fell flat, not helped by attempts by First Tuesday to grab a little bit of the money itself by charging a levy on VC payouts. But we can safely ignore some comments from unnamed VCs that, as deep into net history as 18 months ago, they felt it was all a bit naff - that would place us in mid-1999, when First Tuesday was in its heyday. The first balmy Tuesday evening in August that year saw the event - held at Home House in London - thrice over-subscribed. The money men were flocking in, lured by the promise of a fast buck. Perhaps the most attractive, most net-like aspect of the First Tuesday concept was its apparent democracy: the notion that any decent idea could be a goer, given a sharp enough line in sales patter and a bit of luck in meeting a willing VC. The mystery was being removed from venture funding, always more scarce in the UK than in the US. The businesses those nights spawned, however, reads today a bit like a who's who of so what: ClickMango, which went bust last autumn after barely mustering the turnover of a corner shop, was one of the most obvious failures. Others - like music site peoplesound and ihavemoved.com - the site that tells your friends you've moved - have yet to prove they have anything to offer that will allow them to stand out. Moreover.com, the news aggregator, is perhaps the shining alum of First Tuesday - and it was started by the club's co-founder, Nick Denton. In these austere days, with their multimillion pound judgements being proved wrong again and again, we should expect the VCs to feign casual indifference towards First Tuesday. But let's not forget they were looking pretty keen in 1999, in the middle of the feeding frenzy. Then, the plan was to get some funding, build that brand and then get to market - all within six months, and never mind the profits. Chaotic First Tuesday was the perfect breeding ground for such fast living start-ups. If it is going belly up, we should salute it as a symbol of the remarkable times it helped create, and which it ultimately fell victim to. A bit like some look back with fondness to Glastonbury festivals of yore - we'll grow to love its memory, forgetting that it was a bit sweaty, many were ripped off, and that it was probably never as good as it was cracked up to be.

It is known that, at his Downing Street meeting with the prime minister within two days of his takeover, Tony Blair urged him to keep Boycott. It is known that Blair has since had talks with Boycott and his press secretary, Alastair Campbell, also met her two weeks ago. </p> <p>It may be too far-fetched to suggest that she is being held hostage in order for Desmond to avoid a referral of the Express deal to the competition commission. Given the strict financial criteria, a referral is unlikely, but there could be a public interest reason to investigate whether he is a fit and proper owner.

      "bodyText": "Panorama has been dealt another ratings blow - last night it posted its second smallest audience since moving to Sunday nights. According to unofficial ratings, Gavin Hewitt's profile of George W Bush was watched by only 2.7m - just 15 % of all viewers watching TV at the time. It was the worst performing programme since another report on US politics, broadcast on October 22, when the show only pulled in 2.2m viewers - a 13% share of viewing. That edition, about the underhand tactics used by both sides in the US presidential election, was the lowest rating Panorama since the BBC1 current affairs flagship moved to Sunday night on October 15. Overall, Panorama has averaged 3.1m and an 18% share since the move. This is 1m viewers down on what the show averaged in its last three Monday-night outings last year. The low ratings will fuel fears that current affairs is been marginalised at the BBC. Director-general Greg Dyke and director of television Mark Thompson have given assurances that Panorama will not be moved out of primetime. However, many critics believe the series is being screened on the wrong day and too late in the evening. Last week, Panorama reporter John Ware - who made the film exposing the Omagh bombing suspects - attacked TV executives for neglecting investigative journalism. Sunday night's Panorama was up against ITV's Tarrant on TV, which had 8.5m viewers, and Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned, which gained 5.2m. But the David Baddiel and Frank Skinner vehicle did less well on Friday, when it lost out to Channel 4's So Graham Norton on a grisly night for ITV late-evening comedy. So Graham Norton attracted 3.3m viewers and a 21% share, battering Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned down to just 3m and an 18% share. Channel 4's entertainment champion was up against ITV's comedy pretenders for the first half-hour of his show, which ran between 10.30pm and 11.20pm. Baddiel and Skinner Unplanned also lost out to BBC1's Clive Anderson Now. The satirical current affairs show gained 3.6m viewers between 10.35pm and 11.05pm. Immediately before that, returning ITV comedy drama Big Bad World fared little better, losing out to BBC1's Ten O'Clock News. The Ardal O'Hanlon vehicle had 4.1m - one in five viewers - from 10pm; while the BBC1 news bulletin notched up 5m and a 24% share. BBC2's post-Comedy Zone Friday night schedule is shaping up well. A Timewatch history documentary on Hitler's right-hand man Heinrich Himmler drew 3.2m viewers and a 13% share on Friday. It beat a Channel 4 repeat of Friends, which had 2.2m from 9pm, and home-grown sketch show Armstrong and Miller, which drew 1.3m viewers from 9.30pm. On Saturday night, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? notched up 11.1m. Viewers tuned in to watch Steve Devlin, who previously pulled out of the show because of nerves, fail in his bid to win \u00a31m. London's Burning returned strongly to ITV on Sunday night from 9-10pm. The long-running drama gained 10.9m viewers and a 44% share, beating BBC1 drama Rebel Heart, which pulled in 3.2m. Last night, the terrestrial premiere of Contact, starring Jodie Foster, from 9-11.50pm, was the high point of Channel 5's Sci-Five Weekend. The film drew 2.5m viewers and a 14% share.",

These will be people of imagination finally taking advantage of a low-cost distribution medium to get their type of humour, interest, dramatic perception, aesthetic judgment out to like-minded people and have them pay for it. Broadband and DiVX are the real foundations for the streamed narrowcasting world we've been predicting these past few years. Broadcasting in the fullest sense of the word. \u0095 David Docherty is managing director of broadband content at Telewest",

The decision was taken by the transport minister, Lord Macdonald, after a meeting with health and safety officials and accident investigators. Ministers are anxious to keep what is rapidly becoming a politically sensitive issue as low key as possible in the lead-up to the election. They hope that the matter will be effectively dealt with and public disquiet satisfied if high-profile criminal prosecutions are taken against those directly involved in the crash in October, which killed four people. The sources said that a public inquiry could last up to two years and would hold up any criminal action against Railtrack or Balfour Beatty, the maintenance contractor at the Hatfield crash site. But this seems of secondary importance now because Lord Cullen, who chaired the joint inquiry into the Paddington and Southall rail disasters, has been asked to comment on the implications of Hatfield for the industry when he reports later this year. The Department of Transport confirmed last night that there would be no public inquiry into Hatfield. It said the health and safety executive was carrying out a detailed examination of the tragedy with independent experts and transport police and would make its recommendations as soon as possible. \"In the circumstances, the government does not think that a public inquiry is necessary.\" James Melvin, the brother-in-law of pilot Steve Arthur, 46, one of the four men killed in the Hatfield crash, said he was shocked at the decision not to hold a public inquiry and believed the government was making a \"huge mistake\". \"It is a bolt out of the blue,\" he said. \"I fully expected a public inquiry because it is only right and just that one should be held.\" Criminal prosecutions for manslaughter are expected to be laid against up to six named staff at Railtrack and Balfour Beatty as a direct result of the Hatfield crash.

      "bodyText": "The official inquiry into the Hatfield rail disaster, which exposed the appalling state of rail's infrastructure, is moving towards naming the guilty parties. Railtrack and Balfour Beatty, its maintenance contractor, are facing charges of criminal manslaughter for the accident in which four people were killed in October last year. Both companies have already conceded that 11 months before the crash they were aware of the cracked rail at the crash site. They were given a six-month warning by site engineers to replace the rail, but failed to act. The question arises as to whether the police will ask the Crown Prosecution Service to bring charges against named people. The British Transport Police today confirms that charges are likely to be levelled at up to six senior managers from both companies some time next month. If this happens, it will be the first time that individual managers have been asked to carry the can. The CPS stopped short of corporate manslaughter over the Southall rail crash in 1997. Instead, Great Western Trains was fined \u00a31.5m. Two of the top men at Railtrack at the time of Hatfield were Gerald Corbett, its chief executive, and Nick Pollard, area director for the east coast main line. Mr Corbett has since resigned and Mr Pollard has been moved to another job in the organisation. The government is anxious for a quick fix so that somebody can take the rap. It has decided, much to the astonishment of the Hatfield victims' families, not to press on with a public inquiry, arguing that it would get in the way of a criminal trial and hold up proceedings for up to two years. The families argue that while a criminal trial is to be welcomed, its focus is narrow. They say that a full inquiry would undoubtedly bring out crucial evidence about the background to the crash and the dangerous state of the industry, which the government might wish to hush up. Tomorrow's interim report on Hatfield by the health and safety executive will be revealing. It will say that the rail on which the accident occurred was shattered into 300 pieces, like a piece of glass. Investigators are also examining the coupling which broke on the buffet car, in which the four people died. This caused the coach to rear up off the track while the other carriages remained upright. Hatfield led to a widespread shutdown of the industry from which it is still recovering three months later. Putting it into context, Railtrack found 300 other \"serious'' rail cracks after Hatfield, all of which could have led to another accident.",

He was possibly the only sex symbol in the history of Marxism.

There always was something vacant about the cult of Che.

The Che Gavara Story is perhaps an improvement. Turk is certainly disarmingly honest - he admits he doesn't know much about Guevara. The German artist Joseph Beuys used to organise massive self-educative events a little like this, but he was a charismatic figure, able to inspire audiences with his crazy visions. I'll acknowledge the interest of Gott's talk on Che in Africa, but Turk's event is more like a Beuys action restaged by Andy Warhol's Factory: an aimless, inarticulate shambles. One day he reported on the movement's activities: the planned video of Citizen Smith wasn't available, so a Werner Herzog film about the Congo was shown instead. There's going to be a demonstration on Saturday, though last week Turk still didn't know what about. </p> <p>Yet the real focus of irritation, as tinny Cuban music comes out of the CD player and we pass around a book of pictures of the revolutionary, is Che himself. There are worthier radical figures to celebrate, but the hunchbacked Antonio Gramsci, great theorist of an enlightened class struggle who died in an Italian prison, or the bespectacled Walter Benjamin, were both too bookish for this kind of crass, post-political idolatry. They said things that were complicated and difficult. You'd have to hang out at Turk's quite a long time to establish that Che ever said anything at all (as opposed to looking great). And, when you do encounter his views, it's a crushing disappointment. His masterpiece of revolutionary theory, La Guerra de Guerrillas (1961), outlines a strategy of jungle warfare that he himself discredited by his dismal failure in Bolivia in 1967. </p> <p>Che is the perfect political hero for an apolitical age, because none of us is ever likely to be moved to any action by him. He inhabits a fantasy world of jungle shoot-outs, which his recently published diaries of motorbike journeys around Argentina and misadventure in the Congo make available to the armchair revolutionary: travel writing with a machine gun.

After defecting, he managed not only to land a safe Tory seat at Daventry but to obtain office under Margaret Thatcher as a junior social security minister, from 1979 until ill health forced his retirement in 1981. Knighted in 1987, the year he stepped down as an MP, he popped up in the 1992 new year's honours list as a peer.</p> <p>Probably there was something in his background and resilience, rather than in his pugnacious personality, that appealed to the then prime minister, John Major, himself another improbable south London survivor.</p> <p>Educated at Whitgift school, Croydon, then as now a fee-paying school, Prentice went to the London School of Economics, worked as a temporary civil servant and emerged from military service in the Royal Artillery in the officer class, serving in Italy and Austria during the second world war.</p> <p>After another spell at the LSE, he graduated and, in 1950, joined the staff of the Transport &amp; General Workers Union (TGWU), then under its formidable leader, Ernie Bevin, Labour's foreign secretary. The union propelled Prentice into parliament as MP for East Ham North in 1957.</p> <p>A conventional political career beckoned. When Labour finally won back power in 1964, after the internecine 50s, Harold Wilson made Prentice a minister of state, first at Education and Science (1964-66), then Public Buildings and Works (1966-67), and finally in charge of the still-new Ministry of Overseas Development (1967-69).</p> <p>In opposition, after 1970, Prentice was a red-faced and genial colleague who had a knack of doing well in shadow cabinet elections, sometimes coming top, to the surprise of colleagues. In 1974, with Labour back in power, he entered the cabinet as education secretary, cheerfully helping to abolish direct grant status for leading grammar schools and driving them into the private sector - a problem that haunts Labour governments to this day.</p> <p>By 1975 Wilson sent him back to Overseas Development. But by this time, troubles were brewing in his renamed constituency, Newham North-East, which he was accused of neglecting, usually an important feature of deselection battles in any party. The larger picture was one of growing economic strain under successive oil shocks, which fed through into rising unemployment and inflation, putting pressure on public services, including councils.</p> <p>Leftwing militancy among unions was matched by infiltration - or \"entryism\" in the jargon of the time - by previously banned groups like the Militant Tendency. Prentice had his supporters in Newham, leading councillors included, but he was also opposed by the legitimate left.</p> <p>What made his battle so memorable was that bedsit Trotskyism was matched in Newham by the arrival of alleged Labour moderates, notably a young Oxford graduate called Julian Lewis, to fight on the MP's behalf. Helped by funding from the Freedom Association (it later emerged), Lewis, now himself the Tory MP for New Forest East and on William Hague's right, briefly won control of the constituency party in late 1976. As befitted a turbulent decade, the language on both sides was extravagant.</p> <p>When asked to resign, Prentice hit back at the \"little gang\" who ran the local party, accusing them of \"going completely round the bend\" and of indulging in a \"transparent fiddle\". He claimed that the crucial deselection resolution had been tabled without reference to him and that the situation had reached \"low farce\" and \"pure communism\".</p> <p>At Labour's 1976 party conference - the one that saw chancellor Denis Healey recalled from an IMF meeting to face his furious critics in Blackpool - Prentice appealed from the rostrum to have the national executive committee endorsement of his deselection overturned. \"Political cowardice as the price of political survival,\" he called it. The conference was unmoved.</p> <p>When he joined the Tories, Labour allies, who had backed him, including Shirley Williams, herself to break with Labour four years later, were furious and embarrassed. Naturally, his Newham enemies were gleeful at their early, somewhat self-fullfilling detection of what ex-chief whip Bob Mellis (no leftwinger he) now dubbed \"a nauseating traitor\". Prentice said at the time that his defection was brought about by \"a growing emphasis on class war and Marxist dogma\" in the Labour party. Yet he remained loyal to comprehensive schools and to incomes policy even as he became a Thatcher convert.</p> <p>As Tory-to-Labour defectors are now finding in their turn, new colleagues do not readily embrace a convert. With honourable exceptions, their old colleagues reserve a special venom for them. Like the gang of four who formed the SDP in 1981, and assorted politicians who defected or gave up during Labour's long rehabilitation, Prentice got little credit from those who stayed behind to fight - or from those leftwingers who had fought him, stayed behind and have slowly metamorphosed into Blairites.</p> <p>Prentice would have chuckled at some of his old foes in sharp suits and sombre ties. In later years, he was president of the Conservative Association in Devizes, where Tory chairman, Michael Ancram is the MP. He lived in Marlborough and listed walking and golf among his recreations.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Joan, and a daughter, Christine.</p> <p>\u0095 Reginald Ernest Prentice, Baron Prentice of Daventry, politician, born July 16 1923; died January 18 2001</p>",

Helped by funding from the Freedom Association (it later emerged), Lewis, now himself the Tory MP for New Forest East and on William Hague's right, briefly won control of the constituency party in late 1976. As befitted a turbulent decade, the language on both sides was extravagant. When asked to resign, Prentice hit back at the \"little gang\" who ran the local party, accusing them of \"going completely round the bend\" and of indulging in a \"transparent fiddle\". He claimed that the crucial deselection resolution had been tabled without reference to him and that the situation had reached \"low farce\" and \"pure communism\". At Labour's 1976 party conference - the one that saw chancellor Denis Healey recalled from an IMF meeting to face his furious critics in Blackpool - Prentice appealed from the rostrum to have the national executive committee endorsement of his deselection overturned. \"Political cowardice as the price of political survival,\" he called it. The conference was unmoved. When he joined the Tories, Labour allies, who had backed him, including Shirley Williams, herself to break with Labour four years later, were furious and embarrassed. Naturally, his Newham enemies were gleeful at their early, somewhat self-fullfilling detection of what ex-chief whip Bob Mellis (no leftwinger he) now dubbed \"a nauseating traitor\". Prentice said at the time that his defection was brought about by \"a growing emphasis on class war and Marxist dogma\" in the Labour party. Yet he remained loyal to comprehensive schools and to incomes policy even as he became a Thatcher convert. As Tory-to-Labour defectors are now finding in their turn, new colleagues do not readily embrace a convert. With honourable exceptions, their old colleagues reserve a special venom for them. Like the gang of four who formed the SDP in 1981, and assorted politicians who defected or gave up during Labour's long rehabilitation, Prentice got little credit from those who stayed behind to fight - or from those leftwingers who had fought him, stayed behind and have slowly metamorphosed into Blairites. Prentice would have chuckled at some of his old foes in sharp suits and sombre ties. In later years, he was president of the Conservative Association in Devizes, where Tory chairman, Michael Ancram is the MP. He lived in Marlborough and listed walking and golf among his recreations. He is survived by his wife, Joan, and a daughter, Christine. \u0095 Reginald Ernest Prentice, Baron Prentice of Daventry, politician, born July 16 1923; died January 18 2001",

As part of the deal, the star will take over from Ant and Dec as the main host of BBC1 Saturday evening entertainment show, Friends Like These. The SM:TV Live pair are quitting their BBC1 show to develop an ITV peaktime entertainment format. Mr Wright, who had his own chat show on ITV, has signed up to present a football programme on Radio 5 Live with former Crystal Palace team-mate Mark Bright. He told BBC1 Breakfast News today that he chose television over football management because he felt he could be more successful in a TV career. \"I am never going to be England manager, so why should I stay in something where I cannot reach the top,\" said Mr Wright. \"Ian has great talent and charisma and he is one of life's enthusiasts,\" said BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey. \"He sums up what I am trying to do with BBC1 and the new spirit of the channel,\" she added. The signing of Mr Wright is part of a concerted drive by the BBC to rebuild its on-screen talent line-up following a series of high-profile defections. On Friday, the corporation announced it had signed Olympic boxing gold medallist Audley Harrison to an exclusive deal. Jonathan Ross has also been signed to an exclusive contract. Louis Theroux, presenter of BBC2's Weird Weekend series, has also signed a two-year deal with the corporation. He will be developing a new series as well as having the opportunity to do more one-off programmes such as the highly acclaimed When Louis Met Jimmy. \"Louis and BBC2 have been a fantastic combination resulting in some of the most original television in recent years,\" said BBC2 controller Jane Root. \"The next two years will see Louis spreading his wings on BBC2 and bringing his inimitable style to some new and exciting formats,\" she added.

In humans, a length of adult DNA from a male enters an egg and unites with DNA from a female, turns back the clock, becomes the first infant cell, divides and starts a cascade of reactions that turns one fertilised egg into 1,000bn cells of more than 200 different kinds. </p> <p>How it does this is a whole series of mysteries, but one key to these lies in first stem cells from which all bone, skin, blood and nerves subsequently stem. These appear in the first 14 days, before the cell implants in the womb. </p> <p>For the last 10 years, British scientists have used embryos up to 14 days old to assist infertile couples to a pregnancy, and to study the puzzles of infertility. </p> <p>Four years ago, Scottish scientists stunned the world by taking DNA from a dead sheep and growing Dolly.

      "bodyText": "DNA has been around for 3.8bn years, renewing itself with each life at conception. In humans, a length of adult DNA from a male enters an egg and unites with DNA from a female, turns back the clock, becomes the first infant cell, divides and starts a cascade of reactions that turns one fertilised egg into 1,000bn cells of more than 200 different kinds. How it does this is a whole series of mysteries, but one key to these lies in first stem cells from which all bone, skin, blood and nerves subsequently stem. These appear in the first 14 days, before the cell implants in the womb. For the last 10 years, British scientists have used embryos up to 14 days old to assist infertile couples to a pregnancy, and to study the puzzles of infertility. Four years ago, Scottish scientists stunned the world by taking DNA from a dead sheep and growing Dolly. Then three years ago, US scientists working with private money managed to \"immortalise\" stem cells in a laboratory dish. The combination of the two discoveries seemed to open a magic door: onto a horizon in which incurable, irreversible diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease could be one day cured. \"Personalised\" stem cells could be grown in a dish, and implanted in a sufferer, to make new nerve cells grow. The paralysed Superman actor, Christopher Reeve, might walk again.

Ello ayud\u00f3 a acelerar los cambios para <strong>convocar</strong> elecciones, etc.</p> <p>Marta: Creo que s\u00ed que fue decisivo. Franco lo nombr\u00f3 su sucesor para que siguiera con su r\u00e9gimen totalitario pero Juan Carlos prefiri\u00f3 la democracia.

Si le toca al pr\u00edncipe Felipe, pues <strong>que lo sea</strong>. <strong>Me da igual</strong>. Las monarqu\u00f3as, la religi\u00f3n, todas estas cosas son de derechas y totalitarias.

      "bodyText": "Hace veinticinco a\u00f1os Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n fue proclamado Rey de Espa\u00f1a. Era el 22 de noviembre de 1975. Dos d\u00edas antes hab\u00eda muerto el general Francisco Franco. Este militar hab\u00eda empezado y ganado la guerra civil espa\u00f1ola. Durante cuarenta a\u00f1os fue jefe de Estado, hasta que muri\u00f3 anciano en su palacio. Franco hab\u00eda nombrado al pr\u00edncipe Juan Carlos como su sucesor. En 1975 el futuro de Espa\u00f1a y de la restauraci\u00f3n de la monarqu\u00eda era incierto. Hoy, veinticinco a\u00f1os m\u00e1s tarde, el ochenta y cinco por ciento de los espa\u00f1oles opina que la monarqu\u00eda est\u00e1 consolidada. Tienen una imagen positiva de la familia real y creen que la monarqu\u00eda deber\u00eda continuar con el pr\u00edncipe Felipe, hijo del rey Juan Carlos y de la reina Sof\u00eda. Sin embargo, s\u00f3lo un cuarenta y tres por ciento de los espa\u00f1oles se declara mon\u00e1rquico. Un diecis\u00e9is por ciento se declara republicano, y un cuarenta por ciento \"no sabe/no contesta\". \u00bfQu\u00e9 opini\u00f3n tienes de la familia real espa\u00f1ola? \u00bfCrees que hacen un buen trabajo? Marta (19 a\u00f1os): Me gustan porque son gente muy normal. No parecen reyes. Son muy majos y hacen bien su trabajo. Me gusta tambi\u00e9n como tratan a la gente. Son encantadores. No tengo ninguna cr\u00edtica de la familia real. Adri\u00e0 (16 a\u00f1os): Yo soy republicano. S\u00f3lo veo al Rey el d\u00eda de Navidad en su discurso en televisi\u00f3n. Mi posici\u00f3n es de indiferencia. No me interesa la familia real. Chencho (17 a\u00f1os): Me caen bien. Es una familia bastante simp\u00e1tica. Aunque no sigo con mucho inter\u00e9s lo que hacen. Su trabajo de representar a Espa\u00f1a ante otros pa\u00edses no lo hacen mal. Son tambi\u00e9n bastante serios con los temas de terrorismo y con las relaciones con Latinoam\u00e9rica, por ejemplo. Est\u00e1n ah\u00ed y hacen un buen papel. Los veo como una familia m\u00e1s. \u00bfCrees que Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n fue clave para la transici\u00f3n de la dictadura militar a la democracia en Espa\u00f1a? Adri\u00e0: S\u00ed, porque el cambio fue para mejorar. Ofreci\u00f3 esperanza. Pero, de todos modos, la democracia no estaba en peligro en Espa\u00f1a porque tarde o temprano habr\u00eda llegado. Hace veinticinco a\u00f1os en Europa todo eran democracias. Las dictaduras ya se hab\u00edan acabado. Es una cuesti\u00f3n de tendencias. Chencho: Lo m\u00e1s importante es que eligi\u00f3 la democracia. Seguramente no fue una decisi\u00f3n f\u00e1cil. Ello ayud\u00f3 a acelerar los cambios para convocar elecciones, etc. Marta: Creo que s\u00ed que fue decisivo. Franco lo nombr\u00f3 su sucesor para que siguiera con su r\u00e9gimen totalitario pero Juan Carlos prefiri\u00f3 la democracia. Fue muy h\u00e1bil dialogando con todos, con los defensores del antiguo r\u00e9gimen, con el ej\u00e9rcito y con los pol\u0092ticos a favor de la democracia. \u00bfCrees que el pr\u00edncipe Felipe deber\u00eda ser el pr\u00f3ximo rey de Espa\u00f1a? Adri\u00e0: Me gustar\u00eda que me lo preguntaran en un refer\u00e9ndum. Entonces tendr\u00eda la posibilidad de votar a favor o en contra. En una rep\u00fablica llega al poder la persona votada por el pueblo. En un sistema mon\u00e1rquico manda quien le toca por sucesi\u00f3n, sin que el pueblo pueda hacer nada. Si le toca al pr\u00edncipe Felipe, pues que lo sea. Me da igual. Las monarqu\u00f3as, la religi\u00f3n, todas estas cosas son de derechas y totalitarias. Son como una dictadura escondida. Chencho: No me molesta pero tampoco me importa si no lo es. No tengo muy claro si soy republicano, pero tampoco me declaro mon\u00e1rquico. De momento el sistema mon\u00e1rquico va bien. Para m\u00ed el Rey es una persona importante que nos representa en numerosos actos. Marta: S\u00ed, porque est\u00e1 muy preparado para ser rey. \u00bfCrees que la familia real tiene un coste econ\u00f3mico alto, medio o bajo para el pa\u00eds? Adri\u00e0: No lo s\u00e9, pero todas las familias reales viven muy bien. Tienen un chollo. Chencho: Tiene un coste medio-alto. Pero de algo tendr\u00e1n que vivir, aunque sea a costa nuestra. Tampoco podemos influir en esto. Marta: Creo que es un coste medio, pero no me preocupa. Glosario/Glossary me caen bien I rather like them un chollo bargain clave (invariable adj) key convocar to call (an election) la dictadura dictatorship escondido hidden hacer un buen papel to do a good job majo nice me da igual I don't care no estar en peligro not to be in danger que lo sea so be it quien le toca whoever's turn it is tratar to treat vivir muy bien to have a good life, to have a wealthy lifestyle",

      "bodyText": "Ministers have backed off from draconian measures to tackle illegal internet adoption websites, instead appealing to the public to report rogue sites so that they can be \"switched off\" by UK web providers. Health minister John Hutton today clarified overnight press reports that suggested internet service providers (ISPs) could face prosecution for carrying material that contravenes the 1976 adoption act. He said that ISPs - companies such as AOL Europe and Freeserve that provide access for their subscribers to the world wide web - would have to remove illegal sites once they were made aware of them. But he said they would not be forced to screen their own servers for illegal material, an admission that effectively recognises the difficulties in policing the internet. The clarification could head off a row with internet industry leaders, who had argued that it would be impossible for them to check all the material being accessed by their customers. The government has also confirmed it will push through legal regulations relating to a section of the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999 that closes a loophole exploited in the recent net twins case. It will introduce section 14 of the act by April. This will ensure that the adopters of children from abroad who are brought back to the UK to live will have to be assessed as to their suitability by accredited adoption workers. In the case of the net twins, the adopters, Alan and Judith Kilshaw, evaded UK accredited home study assessment by claiming they had been subject to a study in the US, which allows couples to arrange private assessments. Parents who adopt from abroad without undergoing the proper checks will face up to three months in prison and a fine of \u00a3600. The remaining sections of the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act are expected to be introduced by the end of the year. The next twist in the saga of the net twins will come tomorrow when the Kilshaws go to the high court to attempt to overturn a decision to allow Flintshire county council to take the six-month-old pair Kimberley and Belinda into care. The council is expected to apply to make the children wards of court. Flintshire social workers took the children away on Thursday night last week after serving an emergency protection order on the couple. Mr Hutton wrote to the UK's internet service providers' association (ISPA) at the weekend warning that they could be breaking the law if they had illegal adoption websites online. Under UK law, only local authorities and voluntary adoption agencies approved by the health secretary are allowed to advertise children for adoption. But he made it clear to today that internet providers could not be penalised for carrying illegal sites they did not know about. He told BBC Radio 4's the World At One programme: \"The recent high court litigation in this country has confirmed that when an internet service provider becomes aware of illegal material on their server they do need to take action to deal with that. \"That is all we are trying to alert them to. We are not saying to all the UK ISPs that they must go away now and check all the material on their servers, that would be completely unreasonable and we are not unreasonable. He added: \"If the Department of Health became directly aware of any website that we felt contravened the adoption act we would certainly bring it to the attention of a UK-based internet service provider, of course we would,\" he said. \"And of course, if any member of the public or local authority or any other source were to alert a UK internet service provider that they were carrying a website that contravened the Adoption Act we would of course expect the UK internet service provider to take action. \"I don't think that is unreasonable.

The TV and press campaign - with the strapline \"Software for the agile business\" - has been created by McCann Erickson. Aimed at businesses rather than consumers, it will be the software company's biggest ever campaign. It will kick off soon in the US and is expected to be rolled out globally this year. The world's biggest company is beginning to feel the pinch of a slowdown in PC sales. Figures released today by UK research firm Context showed the European PC market in 2000 suffered its worst fourth quarter for four years. As the business and home PC markets approach saturation, Microsoft is unable to shift as much of its highly profitable PC-based software such as Office and Excel. Instead it has recognised that growth comes from selling businesses whole solutions - what it calls enterprise software - such as strategies for e-commerce with customers. \"Through the magic of software we can help make smaller companies big, and make big companies fast,\" said Microsoft president and chief executive officer Steve Ballmer. Mr Ballmer is also targeting other areas for growth including mobile phone operating systems and games consoles.

Scientists take genetic material from a cell in an adult's body and fuse it with an empty egg cell. They trigger this to grow into an embryo. Inside the embryo are master cells with the potential to develop into any of the 216 cell types that make up the body, including nerve tissue, blood, heart muscle and brain cells.

This includes Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntingdon's Chorea, diabetes and cancers. New muscle could also be produced to repair damaged hearts. Therapeutic cloning could eventually heal injuries such as burns. It would also end the long search for the right bone marrow donor in leukaemia cases, as perfect-match bone marrow could be created from a patient's own skin cells.

It says any human embryo - including the small clump of cells produced for this research - is sacrosanct. Anti-abortion groups are suspicious that scientists want to develop therapeutic cloning for reproductive purposes. The pressure group, Life, has voiced fears that embryos would be cloned, implanted into a surrogate mother, allowed to develop for a full pregnancy, then killed for their hearts and other organs. Some argue that it is possible to remove so-called stem cells from adults and is therefore not necessary to produce cells from embryos. But although research has shown that adult bone marrow cells can be transformed into liver cells, scientists believe that only embryonic stem cells could produce a complete range of tissue types.</p> <p> <b>What is the current situation with human transplants?</b><br> Currently, victims of heart, liver and kidney failure need xenotransplantation - the transplant of tissue to a human being from a foreign source, such as another human or animal - to survive, but many are dying because there are too few human transplant donors.

The picture, to be auctioned for charity at Christie's in London tonight, is the only known image of Sir Ralph Richardson, Lord Olivier and Sir Alec Guinness in one frame. The answer to the enigma, discussed by the Guardian when the photo's existence was revealed last week, is that the spirit behind their pose is \"irrepressible\" mischief rather than the infirmities of their old age. This was partly because they felt naughty being photographed together without Sir John Gielgud, the fourth great theatrical knight of the late 20th century. \"Johnny would be annoyed if he knew about this,\" said Sir Ralph. So they asked the photographer, Terence Donovan, a close friend of Sir Ralph, to promise that the picture would be kept secret until they were all dead. It came to light only when Donovan's widow, Diana, gave it to the HIV charity London Lighthouse to raise funds for tonight's auction. The photo session was in May 1980 at Holborn Studios, London, officially to take individual shots of the three for Vogue magazine.

Car companies are doing it in the factory all the time, but you could almost do it yourself at home, with an afternoon on your hands and the right tools. You stick a little leatherette around the seats, wire in a CD player, electrify the windows or the sun-roof. Hey, presto. </p> <p>To make a hatchback which is itself a premium grade vehicle and which feels like a saloon, rather than a wishful imitation of one, is something else. But Audi has done, with the A3. </p> <p>The A3 came out in 1996. It was the first time Audi had bothered to design a hatchback since the 1970s, having had bigger fish to fry. The company had been too busy developing and establishing its crushingly cool saloons, the estimable A4 and its big and highly unaffordable sister, the A8, which is the price of a three-bed room house in most areas. With those two models alone, Audi had successfully outmanoeuvred the opposition, making Mercedes look tacky and BMW look like producers of automobiles by appointment to the world's wideboys. </p> <p>Audi seemed to have looked at the most important, decision-shaping consumer desirables within the saloon-buying market - ostentation and the potential for crude one-upmanship - and then to have performed a neat shuffle by appearing to distance itself from all that. It wouldn't do gimmicks and flashiness; it wouldn't be so vulgar as to compete . It would proceed by a kind of understatement - and it would say smart things about you if you joined it in this quest. </p> <p>In fact (and this was neat), there was no better way to get one-up than by driving an Audi. There was no more ostentatious way to be uninterested in ostentation. The company appealed, in the shape of its cars and, very compellingly, in its advertising, to the buyer's inverted snobbery, which is, of course, the most enjoyable kind of snobbery of all. No car has looked down its nose at snobbery quite so successfully as the Audi A4. </p> <p>The A3, with its quietly dynamic look, continued this important family tradition - and still does so in its new version for this year. It's a classy motor, in many senses, but mostly in the sense of middle-class. (So smartly does Audi play the class game that it's difficult to believe it is not a British company. It is, of course, a German one: witness one of the colour choices for the A3, \"Denim Blue\". The denim in question appears to be stonewashed.) </p> <p>It is commonly the way with car relaunches that what distinguishes the new model from the original is a bold mix of the barely discernible and the completely invisible - a slightly bigger badge here, a somewhat smaller accelerator pedal there and, under the bonnet, some fine-tuning which will probably only be perceptible at 147mph, and only then if you are Damon Hill. </p> <p> For most companies, what goes by the name of a radical cosmetic make- over is actually the equivalent of having a skin-tuck in your underarm: very few people are going to notice. Whether you find the new A3 blisteringly different from the old model will depend at least in part on whether the following alterations raise any hair on your neck. Or indeed your underarm. </p> <p>It's changed the grille; it's made the front Audi badge a bit thicker; it's put in new light mouldings; it's made available a new set of alloys (five different designs); some of the airbags stay puffed up for longer, just in case you're in for that always disappointing second impact; it's found a way to get a few more miles per gallon out of a 1.6 engine; it's come up with a slightly different steering wheel. </p> <p>That's the main points covered, I think. Apart from the new, easy-touch boot catch, which slings the back door up almost when you breathe on it. </p> <p>But who could blame Audi for not wishing to strip the car down and begin again from scratch? It was too good a mould to break. </p> <p>Actually, the A3 shares a mould. VW is Audi's parent company and the A3 has been built, for reasons of economy, on the same base as the Golf. You might have imagined that this would force the cars to occupy much of the same territory, yet they could hardly be more sharply distinct from one another. The Golf is to the A3 what Little &amp; Large are to Morecambe and Wise - merely a low-rent, end-of-the-pier imitation. </p> <p>Inside are the Audi staples: plastic which doesn't look like plastic; elegant, clean controls; a densely insulated cabin which ignores road noise almost to the point of rudeness. If you never looked over your shoulder you could assume you were driving an A4 which had just come over all sporty on you. </p> <p>Of course, not everybody wants a hatchback which performs like a saloon. Some people like their hatchback to act like a hatchback.

Three years ago, Gaultier founded his own couture house and showed himself to be more than up to the job. He has even ditched his trademark French nautical striped T-shirts. The show opened with a virtuoso display of inventive tailoring, including a double-breasted suit jacket sliced into two to make a bustier and a bolero. But the highlight of the show was the sensational evening wear. Sophie Dahl looked like a sexed-up Degas dancer in a floor-length corset dress made from the pink ribbons used to tie ballet shoes. Delicate, fluid Galliano-esque gowns in tobacco and aubergine were exquisitely distressed and artistically darned; an \"afternoon dress\" in black crepe had peek-a-boo seams hinting at froths of nude-coloured chiffon; a rose-printed sheath dress had an outsize ruff of red at the hem, the silhouette emphasised by a full-length black net cape. Gaultier has not lost his mischievous edge: his take on the traditional wedding dress finale involved a model carrying a baby under her long veil. There is speculation that Bernard Arnault, boss of the fashion company LVMH, which owns Givenchy, is about to name Belgian designer Olivier Theyskens as the new couturier at the house of Givenchy.",

The official launch of the website will not happen until March, by which time Channel 4 will have completed part of its crucial learning phase and have a sense of what floats the boat of online entertainment seekers. </p> <p>It's largely untrodden ground. The number of good online entertainment channels can be counted on one hand: Zeppotron.com, Z.com, AtomFilms.com, Icebox.com and Heavy.com are the ones that have gained something of a cult status among a hardcore fraternity of web users but the brands have yet to become household names. </p> <p>E4.com should be able to change all that by its strategy of working with the best of the already established entertainment sites, such as Icebox.com and Heavy.com, and aggregating all the programming in one place. It has already commissioned Zeppotron's Office Romance, a series of 15 animations aimed at anyone who has loved and lost that will appear every Wednesday on E4.com. </p> <p>It is also hoping to sign up Z.com's Dare for Dollars, a variation on The Hopefuls, the classic yuck TV item from Channel 4's The Word. \"Contestants\" email in their dares and how much money they would be willing to do it for. Dares are then posted on an auction forum where visitors are encouraged to challenge them or suggest a more extreme dare. The most extreme daredevil is chosen by the web producers who film the dare and broadcast it on the website. </p> <p>Stevan Keane, head of interactive commissioning at Channel 4, says he has high hopes of taking a web show such as Dare for Dollars on to TV. \"The strategic rationale is that E4.com will be an incubator for new talent and shows. We'll start things online and work them back into TV. We're already talking about what E4.com content can go on TV before the end of the year.\" </p> <p>Anson adds: \"It's not about crap TV on the web, it's about using the web in its best way and creating very good, compelling web entertainment.\" </p> <p>The first example of an E4 cross-platform show is Banzai, a madcap Japanese gameshow which will be simulcast (broadcast simultaneously on TV and the web) on Sunday nights. Web viewers will be encouraged to play along by betting on which contestants will win and playing along with a Banzai online game. </p> <p>In addition to building up the Banzai fanbase via the website, E4 has developed a Banzai Wap game and an enhanced TV product which it says will work in a similar way to Sky Sports Active, with viewers able to bet on the outcome of the show using their remote controls. At the moment, however, this service is only available on ONdigital, although Anson anticipates that a version will soon be available on Sky Digital. </p> <p>\"We're taking very small steps with interactive TV because it's expensive but we do want to be able to allow TV viewers to play along with the gameshows. Big Brother 2 will have a significant deal of interactive TV built around it,\" says Anson. The web plans for Big Brother 2 are being kept under wraps but given Channel 4's new remit to make everything cross-media, the web channel is going to be more involving this time around with games and more accessible webcams high on the agenda. </p> <p>The cross-media strategy is also being funnelled into Channel 4's FilmFour website, FilmFour.com, which is gearing up for a relaunch in March and working towards screening pay-per-view films. </p> <p>Another part of the strategy is to make investments in other websites where the objectives fit in with those of Channel 4. Its first was in Fingertips, a soon-to-launch personalised online entertainment tool two years in the making. Channel 4 is believed to have invested some \u00a31.5m in Fingertips, which was set up by the former BMP interactive specialists Ross Sleight and Robert Fields. The plan is to tie Fingertips.co.uk very heavily into E4.com. \"Fingertips was perfect for our needs,\" says Anson. \"It's all about planning entertainment needs and social lives and because of the heavy emphasis on personalisation it will allow us to get very close to consumers.\" </p> <p> Channel 4's other dot.com investment to date has been in Popworld, the music portal co-founded by the ex-Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller. As part of the Popworld deal, a Popworld-branded daily TV show is being screened on E4, and a 60-minute version is to be broadcast on Channel 4's Sunday morning teen show T4. The Channel 4/Popworld partnership also encompasses a co-branded microsite on E4.com that will be linked to the Popworld portal. </p> <p>The clear message is that E4.com is not just going to be a support vehicle for the TV channel. \"While we do want to support the channel, we want to do it in an innovative way. E4 is a multi-platform brand that we're taking on the internet in a way that mirrors the TV content but is uniquely focused on interactivity,\" says Anson. \"We'll always have something new and fresh every day and when we start marketing the site around the full launch, we'll be encouraging people to come and visit us for 10 minutes every day - it's healthier than taking a fag break.\" </p> <p>Between now and March, E4.com marketing will be confined to the URL appearing on trailers and at the end of shows but over time it will be mentioned in programming and promoted to the wider audience of Friday night Channel 4 viewers. </p> <p>Can Channel 4 pull off a coup and change the way we use the internet? Zwillenberg thinks so: \"E4.com has a chance to succeed where others have failed. It has distribution, marketing and a broadcast partner to go along with creation, production and sales - something no other attempt at broadband entertainment has had.\" </p> <p>Considering Channel 4's reputation for cutting edge TV, the odds are stacked in E4.com's favour. With broadband slowly seeping into the UK, Channel 4 has dropped a firm anchor into the turbulent waters of new media that, all being well, should give it a market leading position whenever the storm calms.</p>",

The clear message is that E4.com is not just going to be a support vehicle for the TV channel. \"While we do want to support the channel, we want to do it in an innovative way. E4 is a multi-platform brand that we're taking on the internet in a way that mirrors the TV content but is uniquely focused on interactivity,\" says Anson. \"We'll always have something new and fresh every day and when we start marketing the site around the full launch, we'll be encouraging people to come and visit us for 10 minutes every day - it's healthier than taking a fag break.\" Between now and March, E4.com marketing will be confined to the URL appearing on trailers and at the end of shows but over time it will be mentioned in programming and promoted to the wider audience of Friday night Channel 4 viewers. Can Channel 4 pull off a coup and change the way we use the internet? Zwillenberg thinks so: \"E4.com has a chance to succeed where others have failed. It has distribution, marketing and a broadcast partner to go along with creation, production and sales - something no other attempt at broadband entertainment has had.\" Considering Channel 4's reputation for cutting edge TV, the odds are stacked in E4.com's favour. With broadband slowly seeping into the UK, Channel 4 has dropped a firm anchor into the turbulent waters of new media that, all being well, should give it a market leading position whenever the storm calms.",

      "bodyText": "Leaked official documents are usually expected to embarrass ministers or civil servants, but now the journalists who write about them have themselves become the subject of a government leak. A cabinet office memo detailing the supposed connections and political leanings of 28 political reporters and commentators, which has been passed to the Guardian, highlights the increasingly ambitious scope of Tony Blair's media management operation. The government briefing paper - which also gives a sometimes waspish assessment of the journalists' prospects, influence and reliability - was drafted by Downing Street staff in political charge of the Cabinet Office-based media monitoring unit. The unit, which was in effect transferred to the government from Labour's Millbank headquarters after the 1997 general election, provides round-the-clock briefings on the press and broadcast media to ministers, including Mr Blair. The leaked memo on daily newspaper journalists is understood to have been drawn up by Carl Shoben and Chris McShane - who both worked at Millbank and are now No 10 political advisers attached to the unit - mainly to guide civil servants preparing daily media briefings. Assessments in the memo vary from the unexceptionable to the questionable, with journalists' politics carefully graded from left to right. Among those mentioned in the leaked briefing, Paul Routledge of the Daily Mirror is described as \"influential in the sense that his columns appear in prominent placing in the Mirror each day\" and \"formerly close to Scargill, but now on the traditional Old Labour right\". The Guardian's Hugo Young is said to be \"obsessed with Europe and freedom of information, but considered very influential among Labour-voting 'chattering classes'.\" \"Rightwing commentator\" Simon Heffer of the Daily Mail should always be included in briefings because he is \"taken more seriously than likes of Peter Hitchens\".",

      "bodyText": "Mobile phone operator Orange has scaled down the valuation of its share offering in the face of mounting market jitters about the health of the wireless sector. The France Telecom-owned company made the move after fund managers said they would not pay top-whack for the stock, reflecting doubts over the welfare of indebted telecoms operators. Orange will float with a price tag of up to \u00a341bn, 20% below analysts' expectations and more than 50% below its previous valuation of \u00a395bn. Up to 15% of the company's shares will be offered to the market, priced between 732p and 860p. France Telecom is hoping that the generous discount will be enough to tempt investors back into a battered telecoms sector that has lost 50% of its value in 10 months. Even Orange's rivals are wishing the company well, as the likes of BT, Deutsche Telekom and Dutch operator KPN have similar offerings lined up. They plan to float their wireless subsidiaries before the end of the year and are depending on Orange to soften up market sentiment. However, investors will be aware that mobile phone operators must attempt stock market listings in order to raise the cash to finance the roll-out of their networks. This will allow them to have a far stronger say in the price of the flotations. European telecoms companies are also desperate for cash to pay off debts built up through acquiring next-generation mobile phone licences. Last year, the sector borrowed a mammoth \u00a3290bn from banks, with \u00a3167bn due for repayment over the next 12 months. Orange operates in 19 countries with a customer base of around 30m, and will use the proceeds of the flotation to expand its geographical reach to 50 countries by 2005. The UK is by far its most promising market with 9.8m customers.

      "body": "<p>From a luxury villa on the Costa Del Sol to the vast, cold expanse of Prague's Wenceslas Square, a vital battle is being joined for control of television and freedom of expression across the ex-communist bloc. In scenes reminiscent of the 1989 Velvet Revolution that toppled the communists, tens of thousands of Czechs have been marching and protesting for a month to save national television from the politicians they say have betrayed the hopes and the legacy of 1989. </p> <p>By contrast, President Vladimir Putin of Russia has spent much of his first year in office trying to secure as much television power and influence as he can. He has just scored a coup with the submission of Boris Berezovsky, the exiled media magnate, to his will. </p> <p>In a typically Russian insider deal, Berezovsky says he is to surrender his 49% stake in Russia's first television channel to the Kremlin via a billionaire middleman, Roman Abramovich, who by way of payback gets to tighten his grip on Russia's lucrative oil industry. </p> <p>The contrast between Moscow and Prague is great, although the issues and liberties at stake are identical. Putin, who last week told Russian journalists that reports of the death of the free press in Russia are exaggerated, is steadily establishing control of all the key national television networks, whereas in Prague people power has put the politicians on the defensive and forced the resignation of Jiri Hodac, the controversial director of Czech state TV. </p> <p>In the south of Spain, meanwhile, Vladimir Gusinsky sits under house arrest amid the opulence of his holiday villa, a victim of a Kremlin-inspired hounding, while his vast Russian media empire, including the country's best and biggest private TV channel, NTV, comes under pressure to toe the Kremlin line. </p> <p>Gusinsky's Media-Most offices in Moscow were raided for the umpteenth time last week, his Moscow house was seized, and the Kremlin gave the thumbs down to overtures from the billionaire CNN founder, Ted Turner, to buy a quarter of NTV. </p> <p>A decade after the great democratic upheavals that banished communism and dictatorship, television has become the big battleground in the new democracies.\"All across eastern and central Europe the political parties are trying to control national television. Then there are the transnational corporations moving into the media looking for profits,\" says Dusan Reljic, a Serbian media researcher at the European Institute for the Media in Berlin. \"The victims in this contest are the viewers.\" </p> <p>Hodac, a former head of the BBC's Czech service, is closely identified with Vaclav Klaus, the rightwing former prime minister who hopes to succeed Vaclav Havel as president next year. His appointment - outrageously political, say the critics - sparked a mutiny within state TV and the protests swiftly and surprisingly spread to the streets of Prague and other Czech cities. </p> <p>But in Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia, too, the powerful are nervously following the drama in Prague and wondering if they are next. </p> <p>President Rudolf Schuster in Slovakia, for example, has been complaining that state television pays insufficient attention to his activities and affords him less airtime than is his due. He is now likely to muffle his complaints for the time being. </p> <p>In Poland, too, where in last year's presidential elections state TV was widely seen to have favoured the victorious incumbent, Alexander Kwasniewski, there are growing calls for changes to the way political appointments to television boards are made. </p> <p>And in Belgrade, where tight control of national television was a key to the longevity of the Milosevic regime, it is not surprising that the state TV building was among the prime targets in last October's democratic insurrection in Serbia. Storming television headquarters in Belgrade was at least as important as capturing the parliament. </p> <p>Since October, Serbian state TV has simply switched sides, indulging in hagiography of the new rulers and exasperating Belgrade's independent journalists. </p> <p>Across the region, the political elites see control of TV as the big prize. TV executives, meanwhile, curry favour with governments to ensure access to scarce resources and subsidies in an industry where insufficient advertising revenue is generated to stay afloat. </p> <p>\"The television people are smarter than the politicians,\" says Alexei Pankin, a Moscow media analyst. \"And they have been very successful in selling themselves as indispensable to the politicians.\" </p> <p>In Russia, TV can make or break presidents and Putin's spin doctors know that. The two big channels, ORT controlled by Berezovsky and Gusinsky's NTV, joined forces in 1996 to win Boris Yeltsin a second term against the odds. </p> <p>This blatant violation of the rules of fair play and political neutrality was justified by claims of the urgent necessity of heading off a return to communism in Russia. In 1999, ORT helped hugely in Putin's ascent to power, denouncing his rivals as gays, murderers or crooks. </p> <p>Since securing the presidency in March last year, Putin has made it a priority to control all national TV. ORT is the first public channel and Berezovsky has just conceded defeat in his ostensible attempt to keep it free and independent. Gusinsky faces embezzlement charges if he is extradited back to Russia. </p> <p>The Kremlin now appears to be trying to sabotage efforts to sell a quarter of NTV, the second channel in terms of range and viewers, to Ted Turner. The second state channel, RTR, is already a mouthpiece for Putin. \"National television in Russia is always a political project,\" says Pankin. \"And what we're now getting is presidential TV.\" </p> <p>There is no debate in Moscow - in contrast to Prague, Warsaw or Budapest - about the values and practices of public service broadcasting. If and when Putin gets his people in control at ORT and NTV, Red Square will not witness the events that have been seen in Wenceslas Square.</p>",

TV executives, meanwhile, curry favour with governments to ensure access to scarce resources and subsidies in an industry where insufficient advertising revenue is generated to stay afloat. \"The television people are smarter than the politicians,\" says Alexei Pankin, a Moscow media analyst. \"And they have been very successful in selling themselves as indispensable to the politicians.\" In Russia, TV can make or break presidents and Putin's spin doctors know that. The two big channels, ORT controlled by Berezovsky and Gusinsky's NTV, joined forces in 1996 to win Boris Yeltsin a second term against the odds. This blatant violation of the rules of fair play and political neutrality was justified by claims of the urgent necessity of heading off a return to communism in Russia. In 1999, ORT helped hugely in Putin's ascent to power, denouncing his rivals as gays, murderers or crooks. Since securing the presidency in March last year, Putin has made it a priority to control all national TV. ORT is the first public channel and Berezovsky has just conceded defeat in his ostensible attempt to keep it free and independent. Gusinsky faces embezzlement charges if he is extradited back to Russia. The Kremlin now appears to be trying to sabotage efforts to sell a quarter of NTV, the second channel in terms of range and viewers, to Ted Turner. The second state channel, RTR, is already a mouthpiece for Putin. \"National television in Russia is always a political project,\" says Pankin. \"And what we're now getting is presidential TV.\" There is no debate in Moscow - in contrast to Prague, Warsaw or Budapest - about the values and practices of public service broadcasting. If and when Putin gets his people in control at ORT and NTV, Red Square will not witness the events that have been seen in Wenceslas Square.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Dermot Murnaghan</strong><br> </p> <p> In its final days before it headed off to the big newsroom in the sky, it is ironic that the ITV Nightly News performed the very role the politicians who so hated it expected. Namely we carried details of some very important parliamentary proceedings that no other bulletin last Wednesday was able to cover - the result of the bitter and contentious hunting debate in the House of Commons. </p> <p>And the reason we were able to carry the outcome was not due to the failings of our rivals, but simply because we were on at 11pm and the vote didn't finish until 10.45pm. Nearly 3.5m people (25.7% of the available audience) were kept informed about the functioning of our democracy. The BBC's News at Ten O'Clock was only able to report some of the earlier debate. </p> <p>And that more or less sums up the frustration I feel about the whole Nightly News saga. In the time that I've presented the programme, there seems to have been more column inches dedicated to who's watching and who isn't - even the prime minister admitted to being tucked up in bed before the Nightly News. </p> <p>The press interest was so intense that I actually found myself on the front page of the Mirror as part of its campaign to have News at Ten reinstated. This led to one of the most surreal events of my career, when I had to feature the article as part of the programme's nightly newspaper review. But despite an obsessive press campaign, the programme was not a failure - either in its journalism or ratings. </p> <p>In the short 22-month life of the Nightly we were able to break several stories at 11 o'clock, including Michael Portillo's admission of homosexual experiences, developments from the Kosovo conflict and Bill Clinton's impeachment. And it achieved a high water mark of more than 6m viewers (admittedly with a following wind from Who Wants to be a Millionaire?), but it also broke 5m on half a dozen occasions. It's overall average was 3.5m. And bear in mind that the BBC's News at Ten O'Clock got 3.4m last Monday. </p> <p>Now I can't say, personally, that I'm not delighted to be moving to tea-time news and rediscovering my family and social life. And at 30 minutes long, The Evening News will still be ITV's biggest primetime news bulletin. I'm also looking forward to another change - a two- presenter format with Mary Nightingale. </p> <p>But I loved presenting the Nightly News (it earned me the Newscaster of the Year award for 2000) and I won't see it die without it being given its due. </p> <p>Perhaps the oddest element of the whole saga was that I genuinely knew that it would happen this way. </p> <p>The extreme case of deja vu that I'm suffering from is all down to a conversation I had at the end of 1998. Shortly after the decision had been taken to kill off News at Ten, a senior television executive described to me the axeing of a country's flagship ten o'clock news show. After being pulled from the primetime slot, the programme was exiled to the outer reaches of the schedule at 11pm. This was followed fairly rapidly by a decline in news audiences, outcry from politicians of all persuasions - and soon after that the reinstatement of the programme, with much trumpeting about \"heritage\" and \"brands\". The country in question? Canada. </p> <p>But it's at this point that the parallels between our experience and Canada's begin to unwind. </p> <p>Because in homes with only four or five terrestrial channels - the majority - there will now be two news programmes at 10 o'clock. </p> <p>Which is surely not the outcome the politicians who lambasted ITV, and its regulator who ordered News At Ten's reinstatement, had in mind. </p> <p>As far as I can see, the ball is back in the BBC's court - if it, too, wants the biggest shop window for its journalistic efforts, what is it doing squatting at 10 o'clock which the majority of the nation feel belongs to Trevor McDonald and News at Ten? </p> <p>Oh, and one footnote - some other losers in this whole affair. Those 3.5m viewers who regularly tuned in to the 11pm Nightly News. Somebody was watching, somebody liked it, some may even miss it. Watch this space for the \"Bring Back News at 11 lobby\". But I would say that wouldn't I? </p> <p><strong> Peter Sissons</strong><br> </p> <p> In the next few weeks, you will get a lot of spin from ITV about the return of its news to 10pm. But let's get one thing straight: it's not the return of News at Ten. That once-great programme was killed off for commercial reasons - an act described by my first editor at ITN, Sir Geoffrey Cox, as a \"betrayal of the public interest by the people appointed to safeguard that interest\". </p> <p>ITV made a lot of money from the move, but it still had a political problem. Politicians liked News at Ten, and liked seeing themselves on it. Most of the public were opposed to the change. And the regulator, the ITC, was unhappy at charges that it had betrayed its obligation to insist on a substantial news programme on ITV in prime viewing time. </p> <p>The relatively small audiences for the 11pm Nightly News - sometimes a third of those for the old News at Ten - added to the embarrassment. And claims by the ITC that audiences for news on ITV would improve overall were shown to be misjudged. When they reviewed the changes, something had to be done. The result was the birth of the compromise already dubbed \"News at When?\" </p> <p>In effect, ITV can now cherrypick the 10pm slot with a moveable news bulletin, tailored in timing and length to the requirements, not of the viewer, but the advertisers. That's not surprising. In ITV, the level of investment in all programmes is a factor of advertising revenue. But it cannot be described as a cast-iron commitment to quality news in prime time. </p> <p>One of the strange things is ITV's apparent resentment of the BBC grabbing the 10pm slot. On the News at Ten O'Clock, we've found ourselves at the centre of the ratings war, with ITV throwing everything at us. We've taken some big hits, but not many. And despite the onslaught from some of ITV's biggest ratings-pullers, we've increased the news audience. </p> <p>Since the launch of the Ten on October 16, the average audience is 5.2m viewers, compared with 5.1m for the old Nine O'Clock News. When you consider that everything has been thrown at us, it's an excellent start. On the big stories - for example, 7.2m during November's floods - the nation turns to the BBC, as ever, in droves. </p> <p>Make no mistake; the BBC is in this for the long haul. As a former ITN man, I always believed 10pm was a better time for news, and that view is now generally accepted at the BBC. Ten o'clock is also now seen as a better news time for BBC1 as a whole. The channel is investing heavily in new drama and comedy, which can be launched more effectively at 9pm than at 9.30pm. </p> <p>As for the team that produces the BBC's 10 O'Clock news, we want to be judged, above all, on the quality of the programme. Judge us on the ratings, by all means, but over two years, not two weeks. However snazzy the presentation, news programmes stand or fall on the reporting team, and their production back-up. At BBC News, with more correspondents in more bureaux around the world than any other broadcasting organisation, we draw on an award-winning team of the most experienced TV journalists. It is a cutting edge that cannot be matched. </p> <p>BBC News has always welcomed competition, and has no fear of going head-to-head with ITN. We don't believe the clash will necessarily be in the interests of viewers, but it's ITV that has created the situation - and which has muddied the waters by its bizarre \"now you see it, now you don't\" attitude to its own flagship news programme. But the BBC News at Ten O'Clock will be there, six nights a week, on the button. And that's something you can rely on. </p> <p> <strong>And the winning channel is...</strong><br>Maggie Brown</p> <p> Who will win most viewers? In the short term, the answer is ITV. That's down to \"inheritance\" - about 80% of news viewers have watched the preceding programme on the same channel, and ITV's schedule is stuffed with hits. Since the BBC moved its news last October, BBC1 has only won nine 9-10pm slots. </p> <p>And ITV has opened 2001 very confidently, with a new Touch of Frost two-parter and Caroline Quentin in The Innocent destroying the BBC's offerings. Even the normally critical Zenith Media concedes its line-up is \"looking pretty good\" - although the jury is out on Popstars. To reduce zapping, the network is revolutionising presentation by rolling programmes together. Last week it staged a presentation to tell advertisers that it will target BBC1 this year, aiming to improve on the 7% leadin peak-time it already enjoys. </p> <p>The balance of power may start changing in the autumn as Greg Dyke's millions flow into BBC1 programming, funding a fourth episode of EastEnders and reviving other popular drama and comedy. But senior BBC executives admit this spring will be difficult. </p> <p>Averaging 5.2m, audiences for BBC's 10pm news were initially close to those for the old 9pm bulletin. But ratings have deteriorated this month in the face of a fired-up ITV: for nine nights in a row, they have been below 5m. </p> <p>Interestingly, ITV network centre sources now concede that viewers missed News at Ten and that factual series such as World War Two in Colour will do even better later, as viewers who might be tempted to switch to the BBC for a 10pm news fix will stay with ITV. Remember, ITV news is shorter, running only until 10.20pm, and has no central ad break. </p> <p> As for Chris Smith's warning to the BBC about a significant reduction in audiences for news as a result of the simultaneous bulletins, the 10pm head-to-head certainly creates an opportunity for Channel 4, Channel 5 and satellite stations to lure viewers with entertainment and movies. But calculating how much any loss is down to the clash - rather than a general decline in news audiences, and/or what Greg Dyke calls the current lack of \"real news\" - may be hard to calculate. </p> <p>At 10pm there are 23m people watching TV on average, according to Zenith Media, falling to 19.3m by 10.30pm, while by 11pm that is cut to 12m. The BBC News at Ten O'Clock and ITV's Nightly News pulled around 8m viewers during the autumn. This compares to the 10-11m who watched the BBC Nine and former News at Ten two years ago. No one knows how viewers will behave when forced to choose between news and news on the main networks. </p> <p>The BBC news machine is vaster than ITN's. But the ITV news provider will compete ferociously. It is desperate to succeed against the BBC: even the bongs are coming back, alongside Sir Trevor McDonald, signed for another four years. Underlying ITN's determination is the fact that ITV is set to renegotiate its news supply contract early (Sky News is hovering once again as a potential replacement), while ITV bosses feel deep unease over the costs and distractions of ITN 24 hour News, which is trailing far behind Sky News and News 24. </p> <p> One final point: the outburst of public disapproval over the axeing of the original News at Ten - including a campaign in The Mirror - was not matched by similar lamentations about the abolition of the BBC's Nine O'Clock News. That shows which side engaged hearts and minds.</p>",

Enough already. \u0095 Lis Murdoch's fledgling media company has made its first high-profile signing. Monkey hears that Kenton Allen, producer of The Royle Family, has passed up an opportunity within the BBC's increasingly deserted entertainment department to take the Murdoch shilling. She's back. \u0095 Ex-literary editor of the Sunday Times, Harry Ritchie, has penned the latest based-on-experience novel to cause excitement in the media world. Ritchie's book, The Friday Night Club, tells the story of the Sunday Chronicle and its not-very-bright editor Jonathan Witherington. So not at all about John Witherow then. \u0095 New Panorama editor Mike Robinson was so underwhelmed by the film-making skills of staff on the troubled BBC current affairs show that he sent them all off to a workshop with respected BBC documentaries chief Olivia Lichtenstein. The suggestion, as you can imagine, didn't go down too well with the more seasoned members of the team, and a three-line whip had to be imposed on Tom Mangold, Jane Corbin and John Ware. While Ms Corbin is the model of decorum, the gruff words of Mangold and Ware cannot be reprinted in a family diary.",

      "body": "<p>Greg Dyke reckons that moving the BBC television news from nine o'clock to 10 is one of the best things he's done in his first year as director-general. He's an action man, a risk taker by instinct, and although he speaks with consummate diplomacy about life within the constraining culture of the corporation, he saw his opportunity and seized it. He played the game rather like a football striker shackled by a tight defence. A patient build-up, a moment of individual magic, the ball's in the net and the crowd are jubilant. The build-up involved weeks of preparation before the proposal was taken to the board of governors. Last August there was unanimous agreement that the time had come to confront the taboos by moving the news to the 10pm slot left vacant by ITV. </p> <p>If that was dramatic in principle, the real maverick touch came in the autumn when the ITC told the commercial companies to return ITN news to its old niche, at least for part of the week. Dyke instantly cut short the planning and gave BBC news a two-week deadline to occupy the open ground at 10pm while at the same time doubling the length of the regional news bulletin to seven minutes. \"We decided to move fast, something unusual at the BBC,\" recalls Dyke. \"It was one of the best things I have done in terms of the effect on the morale of the staff. They realised that we really could move quickly. I've discovered, just wandering around, the number of people who have found the change quite exhilarating. It's unbelievable. </p> <p>\"We got a lot of flak from politicians and journalists,\" he adds without concern. \"But any change at the BBC brings you flak, it always has done.\" Tonight, barely three months later and with viewing figures unimproved, Dyke and his news team face their toughest challenge when the trusty Trevor McDonald will once again front News at Ten. The nation will have to make its choice as BBC (average 5.2m at 10pm) and ITV (3.2m at 11pm) go head to head on three or four days a week. </p> <p>Dyke is scornful of the competition's scheduling, doubting that companies such as Carlton and Granada wanted to give back prime drama and comedy time to news. </p> <p>\"They're not even promising to show the News at Ten on the same nights each week,\" Dyke scoffs. \"It's a ridiculous idea, there's not a broadcaster in the world that does that.\" He puts it down to a \"fudge\" to please politicians and doubts it will satisfy the viewers. </p> <p>Cue Chris Smith, the culture secretary and the man whose ministry includes the broadcasting brief. He is thought to favour a return to the status quo of BBC at 9pm and ITN an hour later and has let it be known that he is \"worried\" that the clash of the bulletins may result in fewer people watching the news. </p> <p>There has been speculation that Smith may try to pressure the BBC to vacate 10pm if aggregate news ratings fall. He has no statutory power to interfere in BBC scheduling and Dyke is in no mood to give back what he has taken with such panache.He says that it's his hunch that the total audience for news is likely to go up: \"Since Christmas the figures have been poor because there has been no real news, but this is a long-term project which may take one or two years to assess. If we eventually make a change it will be a decision taken by the governors and the executive committee of the BBC. </p> <p>\"What really matters is the quality of programmes that you put out before the news. You hope you will retain most of your viewers to watch the bulletin.\" </p> <p>This brings him to the parallel plank in his strategy and the other main area of reform where he has applied himself in his first year: saving money to spend on programmes. </p> <p>\"What matters at the BBC is output,\" he declares. \"The only role of management it seems to me is to make sure you have a good product and the means to make good programmes - and that's it.\" </p> <p>Most conspicuously he has \"flattened\" the management structure which in more brutal language means the first 350 staff have either fled or been been fired in a reorganisation of middle tiers that will see 1,000 departures by 2003. He was shocked early on to discover that 26% of the BBC's \u00a32.2bn annual income was going on what he calls \"running the institution that is the BBC\". His target is to slash costs to 15% of a higher income over three years. </p> <p>Some economies have already made headlines, such as the squeeze on taxi travel, entertaining and first-class tickets. Chauffeurs are down from 19 to eight and the internal market developed by John Birt, Dyke's predecessor, no longer charges local radio stations more to access a CD than it would cost to go to HMV and buy it. \"There's nothing wrong with an internal market, we've just removed the absurdities.\" He saw that saving money was a vital end in itself in a publicly-funded organisation and says it is another factor which has helped improve staff morale. </p> <p>In commercial television, where Dyke spent years as everything from a programme maker to a chief executive - not to mention arch-rival of the BBC - he was used to the discipline of the profit and loss account, a concept that is alien in a public corporation. He was also used to taking a gamble. \"You can't always be sure you'll win, but to succeed you have to take risks,\" he says. \"But taking risks in the public sector is without doubt harder than taking them in private organisations because you are much more publicly accountable. It's a risk-averse culture and I'm not sure there is much you can do about it.\" </p> <p>Dyke calculates that by 2003 he will be spending an extra \u00a3500m on output, with the money coming from the inflation-linked licence fee, savings on salaries and admin plus the growing revenues from the BBC's commercial enterprises. </p> <p>He recognises the argument that it's the corporation's duty to maintain a level of quality before chasing ratings but dismisses the notion that one naturally excludes the other. \"There's a belief that if a programme gets an audience it can't be quality, and that's complete bullshit,\" he snorts. \"We are looking for great programmes. They don't necessarily have to be popular, but they do have to be special.\" </p> <p>Moving Panorama to Sunday night was a consequence of the rescheduling of the main news. It drew the predictable laments from bilious columnists but Dyke is unfazed. Although the audience is down by half a million, he cites research by his former station LWT that showed a higher percentage of ABC1 viewers tune in on Sunday night than at any other time of the week. \"It will take time to settle,\" he says. \"Ultimately, the justification for Panorama is in the quality of the investigations you can do, and the best take a lot of money.\" He's putting an extra \u00a3500,000 into the next 30-programme series and would like to see any newspaper that accuses him of dumbing down put half as much into investigations of its own. </p> <p>Investigations of worthwhile subjects, that is. His old enemies at the Times, the Daily Mail and the Sunday Times have spent time and money this past year scurrying round trying to nail him for financial irregularities or other misdemeanours. Some staked out his ex-wife in an attempt to tap into a rich seam of revelation. Nothing doing. \"It's all crap,\" says Dyke adding that \"a lot of newspapers in pursuit of what they call journalism do a real disservice to themselves.\" He feels vindicated - Peter Stothard's Times campaign against him left the editor looking foolish, he reckons - but still smarts at the power of a few senior journalists to indulge in such hostility. </p> <p>Of course, a man like Dyke isn't out of the news for long. He's rich, colourful and carries opinions that are as challenging as they are often refreshing. A year in charge at the BBC has not dimmed these characteristics although he navigates his way through an on-the-record encounter with care. It's rare to find him shooting from the hip in public and even his \"hideously white\" comments about the staff numbers within his organisation and the Metropolitan police turned out to be based on reasoning he has put forward several times about the need to integrate more people from ethnic minorities in the senior management of Britain's public bodies. </p> <p>He is braced for the coming election when he expects more fuss will be made over his perceived Labour leanings. He is ready for his record to be examined while insisting that he has very little day-to-day influence on the news output of the BBC. \"There was this great myth that I would act like some sort of Svengali forcing my politics on the news department. In fact the editorial power is quite a long way down because the set-up is so large and diverse. The idea that I can ring up a show and say 'I insist that you do this or that' is just not real. </p> <p>\"Part of the problem is that newspaper editors can and do do that and they believe that because they can, then the BBC is like that. It's not. </p> <p>\"An awful lot of bullying goes on at election time, so it's very important that we remain robust in the face of attempts to bully us from either side. We have to be fair, but the parties themselves don't play fair.\" </p> <p>During the last campaign, the BBC extended the Nine O'Clock News to 45 minutes in order to accommodate election reports each day. The tactic was a turn-off. This time Dyke intends to let the campaign take place with no more than 10 minutes tacked on to the standard 25 minutes. Besides, the new 10pm news leaves precious little room between bulletin and bedtime. </p> <p>It is still too early to judge whether the extra investment will work in the BBC's favour. But Dyke is in this for the long haul - at 53 he has a potential maximum term of seven years. The new money and the programmes it will fund will not begin to show in the schedules until September. \"From what I've seen there's some pretty good stuff coming up,\" he says with the casual candour that his competitors will recognise as less of a boast and more of a challenge.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Families of victims of the human form of BSE are expected to be awarded interim compensation payments that may run up to \u00a325,000 each. </p> <p>The government will announce stop-gap payments within a few days, while negotiations continue over longer term arrangements with the families' lawyers. </p> <p>Sources yesterday could not confirm exact sums but the government is known to be anxious to show it is moving on the politically sensitive issue. Eighty-three people in Britain have died from variant CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). Five, identified as probable victims, are still alive and another six cases are under investigation. </p> <p>Ministers have accepted the need for \"no-fault\" compensation to avoid courtroom battles, and as a possible model their advisers point to a trust that compensates people with Aids or HIV - a fund that since 1987 has paid out nearly \u00a3100m. </p> <p>A fund of \u00a31m, to improve coordination of care for CJD patients, exists. But the Treasury, increasingly nervous over the sharp acceleration in cases, will be reluctant to sign any open-ended commitment. </p> <p>An announcement on interim compensation is expected as part of the preliminary government response to the BSE inquiry report, published in October, which calls for sweeping changes in the way Whitehall responds to such human health threats. </p> <p>David Body, a lawyer for the families, said: \"If there is to be an interim payment it will be most welcome. There are people who would benefit, and this would come on top of good work that has resulted from setting up the care package.\" </p> <p>He added that talks were still a long way from establishing compensation arrangements robust enough to last for years. </p> <p>Malcolm Tibbert, chairman of the Human BSE Foundation, whose wife, Margaret, was an early victim, said: \"We are all desperate to find out what is going to happen. No amount of money can replace those who have died, but we have to be realistic, and there are a lot of people out there who have children to bring up and their future has to be secured. </p> <p>\"The sooner the government comes up with a formal offer, and we can see if it is acceptable, the better.\" </p> <p>Many victims' families are frustrated at the time the government has taken to respond to their formal lodging of the court action, although Whitehall has always said it had to wait for the inquiry report, which was published nearly three years after it began taking evidence. </p> <p>But families point out that farmers have been paid huge compensation sums for BSE.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Families of victims of the human form of BSE are expected to be awarded interim compensation payments that may run up to \u00a325,000 each. The government will announce stop-gap payments within a few days, while negotiations continue over longer term arrangements with the families' lawyers. Sources yesterday could not confirm exact sums but the government is known to be anxious to show it is moving on the politically sensitive issue. Eighty-three people in Britain have died from variant CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). Five, identified as probable victims, are still alive and another six cases are under investigation. Ministers have accepted the need for \"no-fault\" compensation to avoid courtroom battles, and as a possible model their advisers point to a trust that compensates people with Aids or HIV - a fund that since 1987 has paid out nearly \u00a3100m. A fund of \u00a31m, to improve coordination of care for CJD patients, exists. But the Treasury, increasingly nervous over the sharp acceleration in cases, will be reluctant to sign any open-ended commitment. An announcement on interim compensation is expected as part of the preliminary government response to the BSE inquiry report, published in October, which calls for sweeping changes in the way Whitehall responds to such human health threats. David Body, a lawyer for the families, said: \"If there is to be an interim payment it will be most welcome. There are people who would benefit, and this would come on top of good work that has resulted from setting up the care package.\" He added that talks were still a long way from establishing compensation arrangements robust enough to last for years. Malcolm Tibbert, chairman of the Human BSE Foundation, whose wife, Margaret, was an early victim, said: \"We are all desperate to find out what is going to happen. No amount of money can replace those who have died, but we have to be realistic, and there are a lot of people out there who have children to bring up and their future has to be secured. \"The sooner the government comes up with a formal offer, and we can see if it is acceptable, the better.\" Many victims' families are frustrated at the time the government has taken to respond to their formal lodging of the court action, although Whitehall has always said it had to wait for the inquiry report, which was published nearly three years after it began taking evidence. But families point out that farmers have been paid huge compensation sums for BSE.",

      "bodyText": "The hit BBC2 show Blood on the Carpet, which lifts the lid on senior corporate bust-ups, has been suspended from the schedules. Nick Mirsky, who has produced both series of the critically acclaimed documentary, said \"there probably won't be another run\". \"We've trawled the last decade for the best stories and I think the ground needs to be left fallow for a while. \"It's also quite hard to gain access for these shows,\" Mr Mirsky added. It took eight months to persuade ex-BBC chief Matthew Bannister to take part in Walking with Disc Jockeys. And it took 18 months to get Rocco Forte in front of camera for the show about his takeover battle with Granada, Mr Mirsky revealed. Last week's instalment focused on Mr Bannister's stormy stewardship of BBC Radio 1, from his ousting of DJs such as Simon Bates and DLT to the hiring and firing of Chris Evans. In the past, Blood on the Carpet has tackled Gerry Robinson's hostile Granada takeover of Mr Forte's hotel business and the short and unhappy alliance between royal-wedding-dress designer Elizabeth Emanuel and Joe Bloggs founder Shami Ahmed. The four shows still to run focus on British Biotech, the battle between two rival darts organisations, the 1999 Woodstock music festival and the gourmet sausage industry. \"We want to go out on a high but the strand will probably be rested for a while,\" Mr Mirsky said. The first series went out in summer 1998 and was repeated early the following year. In some cases, Mr Mirsky has spent more than two years working on individual programmes, while keeping costs down by having a small production team. Blood on the Carpet is produced by BBC creative director Robert Thirkell's business unit. It is also responsible for Trouble at the Top and Back to the Floor. Mr Mirsky said he would probably move on from the business unit when the current series of Blood on the Carpet is completed. However, he added that if good stories about business fall-outs arose, Mr Thirkell's outfit would cover them. A BBC spokeswoman said: \"There are no plans to go immediately back into production with Blood on the Carpet. But that does not mean there won't be any more.\"",

In an interview with MediaGuardian.co.uk, Mr Powell, who headed Labour's advertising in the 1992 and 1997 elections, said a Labour victory was such a foregone conclusion that the political parties would be well advised to scrap their campaigns. Such a move would not be entirely unprecedented - in the 1983 general election Margaret Thatcher was so confident of victory that she cancelled her advertising budget. Opposition leader William Hague is understood to have come under pressure from some members of the cabinet to do the same, to prevent his cash-strapped party from wasting millions on a lost cause. But Mr Powell believes this is unlikely to happen: \"This is probably Hague's only chance - of course he's going to throw everything he's got at it,\" he said, adding, \"it might be more of an argument for Blair, though\". But even if they are not scrapping their ad campaigns altogether both political parties are saving the bulk of their firepower for the final few weeks before the election, with Labour having booked up more than 3,000 poster sites ahead of a major advertising blitz in April. Advertising already released by both parties has been pretty tame, but the gloves are likely to come off as the election approaches. According to newspaper reports, both Labour and the Tories are planning aggressive campaigns that will involve personal attacks on each other's leaders. The Tory party's ad agency, Yellow M, is likely to describe Mr Blair as \"the great pretender\", a reference to his perceived slick style and broken promises. And TBWA, the Labour party's ad agency, is planning a bitter attack on William Hague, presenting him as \"a joke and a danger\". But getting personal can be a dangerous strategy. The Tories famously had their fingers burned in the run-up to the 1997 election when they portrayed Tony Blair as the devil in their \"demon eyes\" ads.

Libeskind, one of the most intelligent architects at work in the world today and famous for the extraordinary Jewish Museum in Berlin, began his architectural investigations long before he built, drawing complex ideas for structures that might never, could probably never, exist. These \"micromegas\" - vast, labyrinthine ideas compressed into small sheets of paper - were first exhibited in 1979. </p> <p>Who, looking at these iconoclastic drawings with their clashes of right angles and fractal geometry, could have seen the kernel of the Jewish Museum, or the outpost of the Imperial War Museum now being built in Manchester, or the planned Spiral extension of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum? Some may have seen references to the work of the revolutionary Russian Constructivists - maybe Libeskind's drawings were a homage to El Lissitsky or Kasimir Malevich. Or maybe, switching countries, to the Dutch graphic artist MC Escher, whose drawings abound in contrary perspectives. </p> <p>Libeskind's early drawings are clues to his highly personal approach to architecture. Difficult to interpret at first, second and third attempts, they represent a search for that which ultimately cannot be spoken about, cannot be described. This is neither as odd nor as negative as it might sound; rather it relates to the prophetic strain of Jewish mysticism that informs Libeskind's work, according to Charles Jencks, writing in the exhibition catalogue: \"Especially the notion of the unutterable or unspeakable.\" </p> <p>The search for the unutterable has driven many artists, musicians and poets. But it might seem an impossible task for an architect, given that any idea must ultimately be forged in three all too solid and knowable dimensions. Equally, a philosopher might not make the best architect, although Wittgenstein (best known for his much-quoted dictum \"What we cannot speak about, we must pass over in silence\") had a go with a house for his sister in Vienna. And yet the Jewish Museum has proved that architecture can represent the idea of the unutterable or unspeakable. </p> <p>There are two spaces in the building that capture this mood: the concrete void that runs through the museum, and the Holocaust Tower, which, seen from inside, vanishes into a trick of light. Both spaces have that quality shared by the innermost sanctum of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem (razed by the Romans in 70AD): an absence. At the core of the temple God was represented by an empty space. </p> <p>But let's come back to earth, or at least the Breakfast Room of the Soane Museum. Here, on a mirror-topped table in one of the most beautiful rooms in any house anywhere in the world, sits a collection of exquisite models of Libeskind's buildings. This is a lovely conceit. The models - including the Jewish Museum, the Imperial War Museum and the Spiral - are micromegas, just like the drawings on show elsewhere in the Soane. Here the originals' complexity is reduced into miniatures that appear to be realised in gold and silver, bronze and lead. Big buildings sit happily inside a small breakfast parlour. \"The magic of the Breakfast Room,\" says Libeskind, \"makes me think of Alice in Wonderland, which boldly proposed that every day before coming to breakfast, one should have constructed seven unprecedented ideas.\" </p> <p>This breakfast room is, you may have guessed, the perfect setting for an exhibition of Libeskind's work. This domed and mirrored interior is one special part of the labyrinthine house-as-museum designed and built by the brilliant, if tortured, Soane, one of Britain's most inventive architects. The museum, with its phantasmagorical collection of architectural models and plaster casts, is, on one level, a kind of cross-section or representation of Soane's poetic mind. It contains multitudes, a play of spaces that inspire as well as deceive. In this house (well, three houses knocked together), Soane compressed his novel ideas concerning space and architecture, his quest for the poetry of architecture. </p> <p>Libeskind's architecture is similarly complex, and the visitors' book at the Soane suggests that those encountering his ideas, his drawings, his models, are either uncritical enthusiasts or baffled sceptics. Of course, Libeskind has been influenced by many of the great architects of the 20th century. Yet his is a brave attempt to reinvent architecture - and one that has succeeded beyond all expectations. \"What is new in his architecture and drawing,\" says Charles Jencks, \"is the intensity and density of contradiction and the tilting of the ground plane . . . But within this disorder there is in-between space or liminal space.\" What does he mean by liminal space? \"In architecture,\" Jencks explains, \"it is that of the labyrinth, while in society it is that of the theatre and ritual.\" It relates to the moments that change your life, such as funerals or weddings, when \"space-time loses visual coordinates and becomes liminal or endless\". It is a blurring into infinity or God. </p> <p>If Blake approached this liminal space through a web of complex engraved poetry, Libeskind's route was his matrix of drawings, models and writing. He reminds us, in an age of so much slick, fashion-driven, soulless architecture, that one of architecture's goals has been to connect heaven to earth, humankind to God. This is a very Biblical view of architecture, but then Libeskind is steeped in the Bible. </p> <p>God only knows how much faith Libeskind ever had that his micromegas would one day become the \"megamicros\" that have been built in Berlin and Osnabr\u00fcck (the Felix Nussbaum Haus) and are either being constructed or planned for Manchester (Imperial War Museum North), Denver (an extension to Denver Art Museum) and London (the Spiral). The last of these has been awaiting the appointment of a new director at the V&amp;A. Should this be Timothy Clifford, it is likely to remain a \"micromega\"; if one of the three other candidates, its destiny is as a building to intrigue and delight. </p> <p>The show at Sir John Soane's Museum is one way of getting into Libeskind's fecund mind. If you still can't make sense of it, try walking around the museum itself, and then booking a ticket to Berlin. </p> <p>\u0095 Drawing a New Architecture: Libeskind at the Soane is at Sir John Soane's Museum, London WC1, until March 10.

It was found that one doctor had had a death threat and another had been warned that a paramilitary organisation might be called in to settle a dispute over a child's care. Gerry Mackin, a doctor at the Little Acorns paediatric unit, Derry, who did the research, warns in an article in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood that doctors' decision-making can be seriously affected by such behaviour. \"Verbal abuse and threats are often overlooked and are not usually reported to either hospital authorities or the police. Such events are often perceived to be part of the job... paediatricians, and junior paediatricians in particular, are at significant risk.\" Dr Mackin interviewed 75 doctors, more than half of them women. He concludes that more training in how to manage aggressive patients and relatives is needed.",

      "bodyText": "Efforts by government lawyers to prevent British newspapers from disclosing the contents of The Big Breach, by the MI6 renegade officer Richard Tomlinson, are expected to collapse this week with the book's publication in Moscow. Further passages were posted on the internet yesterday, after publication at the weekend of an extract in Komsomolskaya Pravda, Russia's biggest-selling newspaper. The website of Narodny Variant, a publishing house set up by Sergei Korovin, continued to maintain that the book would be launched in Moscow today. However, in machinations almost as intriguing as the contents of the book, Mr Korovin was not responding last night to phone calls or emails, coyly refusing to say when or where the launch would take place. Internet orders are being taken for the book on Amazon and Narodny Variant websites. Yesterday's extract on the internet described an undercover mission by Mr Tomlinson to Moscow in 1992, when he was allegedly told to \"exfiltrate\" unidentified \"notebooks\" at an international conference on doing business in Russia. Komsomolskaya Pravda described MI6 training exercises at Fort Monckton, Portsmouth, including, Mr Tomlinson alleged, recruits being dropped off in the city centre and told to obtain the passport number of a member of the public. The book is believed to contain accounts of operations already published, including allegations of how MI6 officers posed as journalists in the Bosnian civil war, had an agent in the German Bundesbank, and tried to infiltrate a suspected Iranian attempt to procure material for a chemical weapons plant. What is new are accounts of MI6 operations which the agency says are damaging, though names of officers and agents have been changed. In a court affidavit designed to prevent the Sunday Times from publishing further extracts from The Big Breach yesterday, an MI6 officer, identifed only as AH, said Mr Korovin also used the name Kirill Chashkin and used professional counter-surveillance techniques. AH claimed that the publisher was \"acting on behalf of Russian intelligence\". Mr Tomlinson, who works in a bar in Rimini in Italy, last night described the claim as \"pure MI6 fantasy\". He said he had been given a \u00a328,000 advance for the book. His main motive in publishing it was \"to get MI6 off my back... I've put all my cards on the table.

Mr Korovin said he would distribute 10,000 copies in Russia, the US and Germany. Russian media, holding the country up as the home of glasnost in contrast with the closed conditions in Britain, speculated that Mr Tomlinson, while operating as a secret agent in Russia in the early 1990s, may have been one of the couriers ferrying out KGB documents that formed the Mitrokhin archive, published in Britain 16 months ago. If Russian foreign intelligence, the SVR, was behind Mr Korovin, Narodny Variant and The Big Breach, Russian media postulated, they could be seeking revenge on MI6 for the Mitrokhin revelations. Whitehall sources denied that Mr Tomlinson had any role in the defection of Vasili Mitrokhin, the former KGB officer who gave MI6 details of Soviet penetration of the west.",

      "body": "<p>Now that he is inaugurated, how does President Bush intend to sell to a hostile world the new administration's plan to deploy a ground-based national missile defence (NMD) system that initially comprises 100 space interceptor rockets?</p> <p>The answer given by Republican hawks is that he does not have to. American security interests are paramount. The US faces threats posed by the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction and offensive missiles. Its government has a duty to defend itself against \"states of concern\" (the politer term that has replaced \"rogue states\") such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq and international terrorists. NMD is going to happen, say the hawks. Like it or lump it.</p> <p>Secretary of state designate, General Colin Powell, former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, will be NMD's top salesman. But in his new role as the chief US diplomat, he will also have to face the opposition. An effort will be made to persuade; selling NMD is likely to involve carrots as well as sticks.</p> <p>Take Russia. President Vladimir Putin has been saying that NMD will create insecurity, breach the 1972 anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty, disrupt strategic arms reduction talks (Start III) and provoke a new arms race. The US will reply that even if Start III were agreed, Russia would retain 1,500 to 2,000 deployed nuclear warheads and a non-operational stockpile of about 25,000. Russia has more than 1,100 operational intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. It is also deploying the advanced SS-27 (Topol-M) intercontinental missile. This arsenal guarantees Russia's security and, in extremis, would easily overwhelm an NMD shield.</p> <p>The argument continues: Russia cannot afford to maintain its current strategic forces, let alone augment them in response to NMD; thus a Start III agreement is greatly in Russia's interest. The ABM treaty, meanwhile, need not be scrapped, merely updated. Russia's immediate security concerns, for instance in dissuading Nato from expanding into the Baltic republics, could be adversely affected if it tried to block NMD. The country depends on IMF, World Bank and commercial bank lending. The US could pull the plug; indeed, Bush threatened last weekend to do just that.</p> <p>The Chinese case is that NMD is yet another manifestation of America's threatening, \"hegemonistic\" tendencies. The US may reply that China has over 100 nuclear warheads and is making more.

      "bodyText": "Now that he is inaugurated, how does President Bush intend to sell to a hostile world the new administration's plan to deploy a ground-based national missile defence (NMD) system that initially comprises 100 space interceptor rockets? The answer given by Republican hawks is that he does not have to. American security interests are paramount. The US faces threats posed by the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction and offensive missiles. Its government has a duty to defend itself against \"states of concern\" (the politer term that has replaced \"rogue states\") such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq and international terrorists. NMD is going to happen, say the hawks. Like it or lump it. Secretary of state designate, General Colin Powell, former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, will be NMD's top salesman. But in his new role as the chief US diplomat, he will also have to face the opposition. An effort will be made to persuade; selling NMD is likely to involve carrots as well as sticks. Take Russia. President Vladimir Putin has been saying that NMD will create insecurity, breach the 1972 anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty, disrupt strategic arms reduction talks (Start III) and provoke a new arms race. The US will reply that even if Start III were agreed, Russia would retain 1,500 to 2,000 deployed nuclear warheads and a non-operational stockpile of about 25,000. Russia has more than 1,100 operational intercontinental and submarine-launched ballistic missiles. It is also deploying the advanced SS-27 (Topol-M) intercontinental missile. This arsenal guarantees Russia's security and, in extremis, would easily overwhelm an NMD shield. The argument continues: Russia cannot afford to maintain its current strategic forces, let alone augment them in response to NMD; thus a Start III agreement is greatly in Russia's interest. The ABM treaty, meanwhile, need not be scrapped, merely updated. Russia's immediate security concerns, for instance in dissuading Nato from expanding into the Baltic republics, could be adversely affected if it tried to block NMD. The country depends on IMF, World Bank and commercial bank lending. The US could pull the plug; indeed, Bush threatened last weekend to do just that. The Chinese case is that NMD is yet another manifestation of America's threatening, \"hegemonistic\" tendencies. The US may reply that China has over 100 nuclear warheads and is making more. China already has at least 20 CSS-4 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of hitting the US and is developing new ICBMs, such as the DF-31, and more sea-launch platforms. These forces could break through any NMD shield, so the principle of mutual assured destruction is maintained. China is already engaged in a big arms build-up with a rising annual military budget now estimated at $60bn. Spending even more on defence will hinder economic development. (Hawks who view China as the next big threat to US global dominance actually hope this will happen). Chinese obduracy over NMD could strengthen pressure in Congress to sell new theatre missile defences to Taiwan. China's successful entry into the World Trade Organisation, its large export trade with the US and its lucrative international arms business depend on smooth relations. It will be intimated that there is a threat of tougher scrutiny of its human rights record in, for example, Tibet. Here in Europe Labour is divided on the NMD requirement of an upgrade to the American tracking station at Fylingdales, North Yorkshire. But the emerging line is that the UK will acquiesce if Russia and others agree. The Tories have given their unreserved support. Despite the threat of Greenham Common-style protests, the US probably expects to have little trouble getting the British on side. The UK is too dependent on intelligence and military hardware, as well as in broad political and economic terms, to defy Washington's will.

At this point perhaps, for public-relations purposes, the chauvinist national missile defence tag may be swapped for something more \"inclusive\", such as \"international\" or \"allied\" missile defence.

For the mixture of ethnic diversity and political conservatism in Bush's administration brings into sharp focus so much of what King said but which was rarely heard. </p> <p>For the most part, King's fight for equality is seen as beginning and ending with civil rights. You would think that his political relevance was over in 1963 with his \"I have a dream\" speech and that his dream ended with \"sons of former slaves and sons of former slave-owners sitting down together at the table of brotherhood\". True, King wanted a seat at the table. But he wanted to see the menu. Having led the battle to ensure that black people could eat in a restaurant of their choice, he knew that this important victory would remain academic if they didn't have the money to pay for the meal. </p> <p>\"In the past in the civil rights movement, we have been dealing with segregation and all of its humiliation; we've been dealing with the political problem of the denial of the right to vote,\" he said just a week before he died. \"I think it is absolutely necessary now to deal massively and militantly with the economic problem.\" </p> <p>His targets were moving from race to class, which is how it came to be that he was killed while in Memphis supporting a strike by dustmen over pay, conditions and union recognition. </p> <p>The 60s were a heady and, at first sight, apparently contradictory time for African-Americans. On the one hand, in 1967, there were riots in Boston, Cincinnati, Tampa, Buffalo, Newark, Memphis, Detroit and Milwaukee. But a year later there were major breakthroughs. In Cleveland, Ohio, Carl Stokes was elected the first black mayor of a major American city. In Washington DC, Thurgood Marshall became the first black member of the US supreme court. But King stuck to the local dispute in Memphis because he knew that so long as progress remained with a few judges and mayors, then the sacrifices of the many would have enabled the success of just a few. </p> <p>In the last speech he made he said: \"Nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in Memphis. We've got to see it through. And when we have our march, you need to be there. Be concerned about your brother. You may not be on strike. But either we go up together or we go down together.\" </p> <p>Which brings us neatly on to Bush's incoming administration. For while we can see, more than 30 years later, that black Americans did not go up together, it is also clear that they did not stay down together either. Illegally employed nannies and cleaners notwithstanding, Bush will have the most ethnically diverse cabinet in the history of America. Its secretary of state will be General Colin Powell, (Jamaican-American); the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice (African-American); the transport secretary, Norman Mineta (Japanese-American) and the energy secretary Spencer Abraham (Arab-American). Bush's conclusion on this is the following. \"It shows that anyone who works hard in America can get on.\" Now, given the levels of incarceration, execution, unemployment, infant mortality and so on among African-Americans we know that is not true. </p> <p>But that doesn't mean that the diversity in his cabinet is not a good thing. It is no good arguing for years that more black people are needed in positions of authority and then complaining when it happens. It does count that Bush has a diverse administration. If diversity is to be generally regarded as a good thing then diversity at the highest level of politics must be a good thing. It just doesn't count for much - yet. </p> <p>Colin Powell provides an excellent illustration of why our expectations must be tempered. It's not because he's a Republican. Someone's got to be a Republican. African-Americans have spent years complaining about how the Democratic party takes their support for granted. Maybe this will force the Democrats to work that bit harder to woo their most loyal bloc of voters. </p> <p>I have a problem with Republicans but I don't have a problem with Colin Powell being a Republican. He has as much right to be wrong-headed in his politics as anybody else. He should neither be spared criticism meted out to other Republicans or attract special criticism just because he's black. </p> <p>But his professional and political rise does tell a story that is illustrative of a pattern in black America which we could easily see here. </p> <p>First there is how he got there professionally. He got there through the army. And how did black people get to get ahead in the American army? Well of course they had to be good. That goes without saying. Regardless of the attempt that is made to link affirmative action with lowering standards, the truth is that more often than not black people still need to be twice as good as white people to get half as far. That is what racism is all about. </p> <p>But being able never used to be enough. It took a threat by Philip A Randolph, the head of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, a black union for those who worked the railroads. In 1948, Randolph threatened to stage a march on Washington and a nationwide campaign of civil disobedience unless President Truman agreed to desegregate the armed forces. Truman reluctantly obliged. That's how America got to let black and white people mix while carrying guns before they would ever let them mix carrying schoolbooks or hamburgers. </p> <p>Were it not for the unions and the civil rights movement, there would be no Colin Powell rising through the army. So I think we're going to need to see what he and his colleagues do about union rights and civil rights before we talk about whether his appointment is a real step forward for African-Americans. </p> <p>The second story is how he got there politically. He owes his position to a man who won an election in which black people were systematically denied the right to vote. One-third of black men in Florida were not even able to register because they were convicted felons. Many others were simply turned away at the polls in Florida. About 90% of those who would have voted, if they could, would have voted for Gore. It is because they couldn't that George Bush won and could then nominate Colin Powell. </p> <p>So Colin Powell got where he is professionally, thanks to the political struggles of those who went before him which won black people their civil rights. And he got where he is politically thanks to the loss of the civil rights of those who might come after him. The success of a few, does not always signify advancement for the many. </p> <p>\u0095 This was extracted from the Martin Luther King lecture, sponsored by the Guardian, delivered on January 20.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gary.younge@theguardian.com\">gary.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Anyone watching the news could be forgiven for thinking that Tony Blair is counting down the days to electoral oblivion. </p> <p>Yet if the polls are anything like right, Labour is on course for another landslide victory. May 3 is pencilled in for polling day, and the Westminster gossip is of which cabinet ministers will be culled to make way for the new blood coming up from the ministerial ranks. Barring an absolute catastrophe, Mr Blair will get his cherished second term and the reason is simple: voters may be unhappy about health, education and crime, but the real meat of an election campaign - the economy - is doing well enough to convince the electorate to give Labour another term. </p> <p>William Hague has to be like Basil Fawlty in the sketch about the Germans. Talk about bodies in makeshift morgues, talk about police numbers - but don't mention the economy. It may work. After a while economic success becomes boring, barely worthy of mention and after eight years of growth news about jobs and prices gets pushed from the headlines. </p> <p>But in political terms, this probably doesn't matter, with the most significant recent pointer to the election the finding that four out of five people believe that their personal and working lives are improving. Polls show that the feel-good factor in Britain is stronger than almost anywhere else in Europe. </p> <p>As far as Labour is concerned, this is virgin territory. Although the economy continues to have many defects, there is not much for the Tory spin doctors to play with in the coming months. Labour as the party of runaway inflation? Forget it. Last year the government's preferred measure of the cost of living - which excludes mortgages interest payments - averaged 2.1%, the lowest since records began in the mid-70s. Labour as the live-now-pay-later party? Take a look at public finances, which will be in the black by about \u00a315bn this year. Labour isn't working? Last week's figures showed the number of people out of work and claiming benefit falling to its lowest for 25 years, and with no sign that lower unemployment was leading to inflation-busting pay claims. </p> <p><strong> Golden inheritance</strong><br> </p> <p> To be fair, not all the credit for this belongs to Labour. John Major handed over an economy in 1997 that was growing with unemployment falling and interest rates low. There was a healthier balance between manufacturing and services under Kenneth Clarke than under Gordon Brown. Labour has been lucky. </p> <p>The international environment has been benign, with the world economy entering a period of stability after the inflation shocks of the previous 25 years. Previous Labour administrations were not so fortunate, although it is true that they then tended to compound their inherited problems through a combination of overambition and error. This time it has been different. One reason for the almost preternatural caution shown by the government in its first two years was the fear of screwing things up. </p> <p>If it is a truism that good economies win elections, then it is an even bigger truism that economic crises lose elections, as Harold Wilson, Jim Callaghan and John Major all found out to their cost. Devaluations, runs on the pound, spending cuts, Black Wednesdays: these are things that lead to a changing of the political guard. The Blair administration has jealously guarded its golden inheritance. </p> <p>Labour's safety-first approach would be more problematical were the Tories able to mount a realistic economic challenge. But none of the four shadow chancellors since 1997 have yet to lay a glove on Gordon Brown, and the 2001 election will be a rerun of 1987, where a government that was respected rather than loved was presiding over a strong economy and faced an opposition with a credibility problem. There is not a shred of evidence that voters trust the Tories to do a better job than Labour. </p> <p><strong> Flaunt it strategy</strong><br> </p> <p> Politics being politics, the government may yet have a fight on its hands. Firstly, there is the risk that voters have become so used to the economy doing well that they decline to give the government any of the credit. The chance of this happening would be increased if Labour repeated the mistake made by Al Gore and refused to use the economy as the centrepiece of the campaign. Gore was reluctant to hang on to Bill Clinton's coat-tails: the argument is that Tony Blair will be reluctant to give Gordon Brown the credit for his re-election. Frankly, this seems highly improbable. The message from Labour's strategists will be that if you've got it, flaunt it. </p> <p>Secondly, it is undoubtedly the case that the strength of the economy has been less evident in Labour's heartlands than in the more prosperous south of England. The number of people working in manufacturing has fallen by 100,000 over the past year as the strength of the pound has affected exports. </p> <p>In 1970 there were three times as many people working in manufacturing as in financial services, but since then the steady haemorrhaging of jobs has meant that there are 20% more people employed selling financial products than in making things. Could Labour have reversed this secular trend? Probably not. Could it have done more? Its supporters in the regions think so. Looked at in cynical political terms, Labour's core constituency has only two choices: to vote for the government or stay at home. The idea that the election will be a walkover is not that helpful for the government, which needs the prospect of a Hague victory to put the frighteners on its supporters and hence ensure a reasonably high turnout. </p> <p>Finally, Labour's re-election prospects could be affected by a serious downturn in the economy. Despite the recent good figures, clouds are gathering. Globally, the US is heading for a recession which will last for at least the first half of 2001 and perhaps beyond. Japan is poised to nose dive back into recession. Retrenchment in the world's biggest economies would have an impact on Britain even if there were no domestic problems looming. But the unemployment data suggests that there could be tougher times ahead. The number of people employed fell by 25,000 in the latest quarter, and using the internationally agreed measure of unemployment - which counts the number of people looking for work rather than those eligible for benefit - the jobless total has risen for the past two quarters. </p> <p>The message for the government is straightforward. The economy is still the key to the election and it is looking good. But unemployment may start to rise on all measures during 2001 as growth slows. So, it should strike while the iron is hot and go to the country as soon as possible. Any delay could cost seats. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>",

The idea that the election will be a walkover is not that helpful for the government, which needs the prospect of a Hague victory to put the frighteners on its supporters and hence ensure a reasonably high turnout. Finally, Labour's re-election prospects could be affected by a serious downturn in the economy. Despite the recent good figures, clouds are gathering. Globally, the US is heading for a recession which will last for at least the first half of 2001 and perhaps beyond. Japan is poised to nose dive back into recession. Retrenchment in the world's biggest economies would have an impact on Britain even if there were no domestic problems looming. But the unemployment data suggests that there could be tougher times ahead. The number of people employed fell by 25,000 in the latest quarter, and using the internationally agreed measure of unemployment - which counts the number of people looking for work rather than those eligible for benefit - the jobless total has risen for the past two quarters. The message for the government is straightforward. The economy is still the key to the election and it is looking good. But unemployment may start to rise on all measures during 2001 as growth slows. So, it should strike while the iron is hot and go to the country as soon as possible. Any delay could cost seats. larry.elliott@theguardian.com",

Carefully planned scenes of public grief in Kinshasa turned into a mass demonstration of patriotic fervour, releasing the tension of an anxious four-day wait for the army's response to the killing. In the Angolan capital, Luanda, the presidents of Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia - Kabila's military allies - met to decide a united approach to his killing and the war against rebels. Diplomatic sources said southern African leaders were considering a full summit in Mozambique on Wednesday. Angola has been keen to pull out of the conflict, and Namibia is drifting that way. But Zimbabwe is the main player in the war against foreign-backed insurgents, and it is President Robert Mugabe who will have the greatest say in Congo's immediate future. Zimbabwean soldiers, the main force among foreign troops in Kinshasa, are in a position to put a stop to any challenge to the new regime or remove it themselves if they choose. As a gun carriage bore Kabila's coffin from the outlying airport into Kinshasa yesterday, thousands of spectators fell into a jog behind. \"Mobutu died and now Kabila is dead too,\" they chanted, referring to the dictator overthrown by Kabila in 1997. \"But we, the people, will run behind.\" The interim president, Joseph Kabila, the dead leader's son, led the cortege from within a phalanx of soldiers as helicopter gunships buzzed overhead.

One of Joseph Kabila's first acts last Friday was to order the payment of salaries to the army and civil service. Meanwhile in Luanda, the presidents of Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia pledged to keep their troops in Congo to defend the government but only Angola gave public backing to the new president. In a joint statement they urged all factions in the conflict to \"contain offensive military measures\". Portugal's Lusa news agency quoted President Jose Eduardo dos Santos of Angola as blaming the \"enemies of the Congolese people\" for Kabila's death, saying they had taken advantage of a lapse in security to try to sow chaos in Kinshasa and pave the way for a takeover of power. The Zimbabweans may not be popular with Kinshasa's citizens but they are not altogether unwelcome. They offer a degree of control and stability that prevents the Congolese army from rampaging through the streets, looting whatever it can lay its hands on. The Zimbabweans are also likely to stave off any rebel attempt to exploit Kabila's death with an assault on the capital.

      "body": "<p>Like all political leaders, George Bush will be judged by his actions in office. Fine sentiments such as those on offer at his weekend inauguration as 43rd US president, like those expressed in the campaign, are mere words.</p> <p>Mr Bush now swaps aspiration and positioning for raw power and real problems. Despite 18 months of the closest scrutiny, quite how this untested, untried man will respond to the harsh challenges of incumbency remains unclear. What was true when he was nominated at the Republican convention in Philadelphia last August still holds: Dubya has an awful lot to prove.</p> <p>If it is any guide, his progress so far during his transition to the Oval office has been littered with misjudgments. In tacit recognition perhaps of his own inexperience, he has surrounded himself with old hands who date back to the Ford administration. But these appointments do not sit well with his Philadelphia commitment to a \"new era\". He has recruited heavy-hitting soloists like Colin Powell at the state department and Donald Rumsfeld at defence. But these two powerful personalities may prove hard to control and will test his unquantified leadership skills.</p> <p>The political complexion of the Bush cabinet also suggests a lack of understanding, or else a deliberate decision to ignore what happened last November. Mr Bush has no clear popular mandate; the very legitimacy of his victory remains in question. Yet in selecting a largely rightwing team including the likes of John Ashcroft as attorney general, he has tilted away, sharply and unwisely, from the centre ground where most Americans live. So much for those other fine words about \"compassionate conservatism\", \"healing the nation\", and \"bipartisanship\". More worrying is the thought that he may actually be unaware of the contradiction. Perhaps he simply did what that savvy old hawk and new White House godfather, Vice-President Dick Cheney, told him to - and then took a break for his favourite videogame.</p> <p>When it comes to the sort of actions Mr Bush may take in future, now he has his uncertain finger on the button, there are three main areas to watch. How he handles any one of them could make or break his presidency. At home, it is the economy and the possibility that the current slowdown could turn into a full-blown recession. If the bubble definitively bursts on Mr Bush's watch, voters who enjoyed unprecedented, unbroken prosperity during the Clinton years will know who to blame. Tax cuts may not be much help in such circumstances. Nor will the Democrats, who are looking for an early revenge in the 2002 congressional elections. All that could leave Dubya facing an identical fate to that of his one-term father back in 1992.</p> <p>Unfamiliar though he is with the concept of abroad, Mr Bush's plans for a military build-up, especially national missile defence, and the expected focus on East Asia and the Middle East, will have big international repercussions, not least on the Atlantic alliance and relations with Russia, Europe and Britain. Taiwan and Iraq have the potential to explode in his face; nobody in the US voted for more foreign wars. On the other hand, neglect or passivity elsewhere could raise damaging prospective questions such as who lost Russia? Or, indeed, who lost Nato?</p> <p>The other basic test of the Bush presidency will be his own personal conduct. Many are the pitfalls and temptations of power, many the snares for the vain, the arrogant and the greedy. Bill Clinton got away with his shenanigans; but Americans will expect better from Mr Bush. Woe betide him if he lets them down.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Like all political leaders, George Bush will be judged by his actions in office. Fine sentiments such as those on offer at his weekend inauguration as 43rd US president, like those expressed in the campaign, are mere words. Mr Bush now swaps aspiration and positioning for raw power and real problems. Despite 18 months of the closest scrutiny, quite how this untested, untried man will respond to the harsh challenges of incumbency remains unclear. What was true when he was nominated at the Republican convention in Philadelphia last August still holds: Dubya has an awful lot to prove. If it is any guide, his progress so far during his transition to the Oval office has been littered with misjudgments. In tacit recognition perhaps of his own inexperience, he has surrounded himself with old hands who date back to the Ford administration. But these appointments do not sit well with his Philadelphia commitment to a \"new era\". He has recruited heavy-hitting soloists like Colin Powell at the state department and Donald Rumsfeld at defence. But these two powerful personalities may prove hard to control and will test his unquantified leadership skills. The political complexion of the Bush cabinet also suggests a lack of understanding, or else a deliberate decision to ignore what happened last November. Mr Bush has no clear popular mandate; the very legitimacy of his victory remains in question. Yet in selecting a largely rightwing team including the likes of John Ashcroft as attorney general, he has tilted away, sharply and unwisely, from the centre ground where most Americans live. So much for those other fine words about \"compassionate conservatism\", \"healing the nation\", and \"bipartisanship\". More worrying is the thought that he may actually be unaware of the contradiction. Perhaps he simply did what that savvy old hawk and new White House godfather, Vice-President Dick Cheney, told him to - and then took a break for his favourite videogame. When it comes to the sort of actions Mr Bush may take in future, now he has his uncertain finger on the button, there are three main areas to watch. How he handles any one of them could make or break his presidency. At home, it is the economy and the possibility that the current slowdown could turn into a full-blown recession. If the bubble definitively bursts on Mr Bush's watch, voters who enjoyed unprecedented, unbroken prosperity during the Clinton years will know who to blame. Tax cuts may not be much help in such circumstances. Nor will the Democrats, who are looking for an early revenge in the 2002 congressional elections. All that could leave Dubya facing an identical fate to that of his one-term father back in 1992. Unfamiliar though he is with the concept of abroad, Mr Bush's plans for a military build-up, especially national missile defence, and the expected focus on East Asia and the Middle East, will have big international repercussions, not least on the Atlantic alliance and relations with Russia, Europe and Britain. Taiwan and Iraq have the potential to explode in his face; nobody in the US voted for more foreign wars. On the other hand, neglect or passivity elsewhere could raise damaging prospective questions such as who lost Russia? Or, indeed, who lost Nato? The other basic test of the Bush presidency will be his own personal conduct. Many are the pitfalls and temptations of power, many the snares for the vain, the arrogant and the greedy. Bill Clinton got away with his shenanigans; but Americans will expect better from Mr Bush. Woe betide him if he lets them down.",

      "body": "<p>William Hague leads the most incompetent opposition in modern British history - a judgment I make with the authority which comes from membership of a narrowly defeated contender for that title.</p> <p>Hague and Co win the palm because, even in 1983, the Labour party rarely made the elementary error which shadow cabinet members now repeat day after day. We lost because we supported bizarre policies, appeared incompetent and were conspicuously disunited. This year Tory prospects are prejudiced, indeed extinguished, by all those liabilities. But the Conservatives add to their unpopularity by reducing every issue to the lowest common denominator of party politics. Has nobody told them that British voters hate \"slanging matches\"?</p> <p>If that piece of elementary information has been circulated among the Conservative leadership, no member of the high command has taken the advice to heart. Michael Ancram (once a rational human being) explained on television that the chaos on the railways was all John Prescott's fault - conjuring up pictures of the deputy prime minister sabotaging the line at Hatfield and tampering with the obsolete signalling system.</p> <p>Perhaps Mr Ancram can be excused his moment of absurdity. There is something in the air at Conservative Central Office which (pace Chris Patten) causes once reasonable men to say anything that seems convenient in the interest of their party. Ancram was only embarrassingly silly. Liam Fox, responding to Alan Milburn's statement on the Bedford mortuary scandal, performed the difficult trick of being simultaneously ridiculous and repellent.</p> <p>Initially Dr Fox - the opposition health spokesman - confused Bedford with Bradford. Scotland's \"12th most eligible bachelor\" is, no doubt, too preoccupied with social engagements north of the border to make himself an expert on Sassenach geography. But why did he think that his party had anything to gain by raving on about the government massaging the waiting list statistics? It was a moment for compassion, not confrontation.</p> <p>Politicians do well to avoid piety. But they ought to cultivate common sense. Fox should have expressed his sympathy with the relatives and his willingness to wait for the report Milburn promised. Instead, he tried to turn the occasion into a party political broadcast. It is easy enough to guess how the television audience reacted. Even the least fastidious must have felt nauseating disbelief that he could so misjudge the mood of the moment.</p> <p>Last week on Newsnight Ann Widdecombe fell, with an even more resounding thud, into the same trap. Jeremy Paxman - as always, determined to be centre stage - began his crime-figures interview with a statement rather than a question. \"You had better make the most of these figures; violent crime is going to fall next year.\" There was only one possible response for an even moderately competent politician to make - \"I hope you are right Mr Paxman. I certainly hope you are right.\"</p> <p>Assuming that she was allowed to continue (admittedly an unlikely hypothesis), Ms Widdecombe should then have explained that a reduction in the number of assaults would be something about which we all should rejoice. She might even have added that she resented the implication that she would make political capital out of human suffering. Instead she held Jack Straw responsible for every mugging committed in England since Jack the Ripper terrorised London.</p> <p>The Tories are sufficiently foolish, or destabilised, to continue campaigning in the same mindless way right up to polling day - constantly accusing Tony Blair of cowardice because he refuses to take part in a television debate. His decision was undoubtedly right. It would be absurd for the prime minister to encourage a trivialisation of the campaign. The TV channels want a confrontation because it would be showbiz lightly disguised as serious politics. They know that the tabloid publicity which it would attract would have little or nothing to do with the campaign's real issues.</p> <p>All we remember about the world's first television debate is that Richard Nixon looked as if he had not shaved. And the obsession with Blair's sweat-soaked shirt, after his party conference speech, confirms that this year's headlines would not concern the more obscure aspects of fiscal policy.</p> <p>In the weeks before polling day I shall feel not the slightest interest in whether Hague's bald head shines under the television lights. Nor will most voters. Indeed they will not care a tinker's cuss about the prime minister's reluctance to take part in a glorified panel game. But the Tories will bore the nation to death with complaints about the \"denial of democratic debate\". That may be because they have nothing much more to say.

      "bodyText": "William Hague leads the most incompetent opposition in modern British history - a judgment I make with the authority which comes from membership of a narrowly defeated contender for that title. Hague and Co win the palm because, even in 1983, the Labour party rarely made the elementary error which shadow cabinet members now repeat day after day. We lost because we supported bizarre policies, appeared incompetent and were conspicuously disunited. This year Tory prospects are prejudiced, indeed extinguished, by all those liabilities. But the Conservatives add to their unpopularity by reducing every issue to the lowest common denominator of party politics. Has nobody told them that British voters hate \"slanging matches\"? If that piece of elementary information has been circulated among the Conservative leadership, no member of the high command has taken the advice to heart. Michael Ancram (once a rational human being) explained on television that the chaos on the railways was all John Prescott's fault - conjuring up pictures of the deputy prime minister sabotaging the line at Hatfield and tampering with the obsolete signalling system. Perhaps Mr Ancram can be excused his moment of absurdity. There is something in the air at Conservative Central Office which (pace Chris Patten) causes once reasonable men to say anything that seems convenient in the interest of their party. Ancram was only embarrassingly silly. Liam Fox, responding to Alan Milburn's statement on the Bedford mortuary scandal, performed the difficult trick of being simultaneously ridiculous and repellent. Initially Dr Fox - the opposition health spokesman - confused Bedford with Bradford. Scotland's \"12th most eligible bachelor\" is, no doubt, too preoccupied with social engagements north of the border to make himself an expert on Sassenach geography. But why did he think that his party had anything to gain by raving on about the government massaging the waiting list statistics? It was a moment for compassion, not confrontation. Politicians do well to avoid piety. But they ought to cultivate common sense. Fox should have expressed his sympathy with the relatives and his willingness to wait for the report Milburn promised. Instead, he tried to turn the occasion into a party political broadcast. It is easy enough to guess how the television audience reacted. Even the least fastidious must have felt nauseating disbelief that he could so misjudge the mood of the moment. Last week on Newsnight Ann Widdecombe fell, with an even more resounding thud, into the same trap. Jeremy Paxman - as always, determined to be centre stage - began his crime-figures interview with a statement rather than a question. \"You had better make the most of these figures; violent crime is going to fall next year.\" There was only one possible response for an even moderately competent politician to make - \"I hope you are right Mr Paxman. I certainly hope you are right.\" Assuming that she was allowed to continue (admittedly an unlikely hypothesis), Ms Widdecombe should then have explained that a reduction in the number of assaults would be something about which we all should rejoice. She might even have added that she resented the implication that she would make political capital out of human suffering. Instead she held Jack Straw responsible for every mugging committed in England since Jack the Ripper terrorised London. The Tories are sufficiently foolish, or destabilised, to continue campaigning in the same mindless way right up to polling day - constantly accusing Tony Blair of cowardice because he refuses to take part in a television debate. His decision was undoubtedly right. It would be absurd for the prime minister to encourage a trivialisation of the campaign. The TV channels want a confrontation because it would be showbiz lightly disguised as serious politics. They know that the tabloid publicity which it would attract would have little or nothing to do with the campaign's real issues. All we remember about the world's first television debate is that Richard Nixon looked as if he had not shaved. And the obsession with Blair's sweat-soaked shirt, after his party conference speech, confirms that this year's headlines would not concern the more obscure aspects of fiscal policy. In the weeks before polling day I shall feel not the slightest interest in whether Hague's bald head shines under the television lights. Nor will most voters. Indeed they will not care a tinker's cuss about the prime minister's reluctance to take part in a glorified panel game. But the Tories will bore the nation to death with complaints about the \"denial of democratic debate\". That may be because they have nothing much more to say. But picking the wrong sort of fight will only increase the size of their defeat. Out of touch means out of office. comment@theguardian.com",

After the three (out of five) solemn pledges offered, come hundreds of challenges - or targets, diligently assembled for Guardian readers last week by Patrick Wintour. Robbery in West Yorkshire down 21.4% by 2004; 10% fewer building fires by March 2004 (against a 1998-99 baseline); 6m museum and gallery visits by children (against 4.59m last year).</p> <p>Such targets, great and small, flow inexhaustibly - beadily superintended by Geoff Mulgan, director of the Cabinet Office's performance and innovation unit. Geoff believes that \"practical implementation has been undervalued in British government and society in the past\". He wants things done, specifically achieved, not windy promises or elegant minutes. He, like his master, has become a delivery man.</p> <p>What's wrong with that? Who defends costly policies which don't work on the ground? If Whitehall stands at the centre of British governance, then Whitehall should be a operated like a proper business - with detailed budgets, performance monitoring, achievement incentives and, of course, management consultants. Geoff fits that final bill neatly: he's run thinktanks and pop concerts and written interesting books. He (like William Hague from McKinsey's) must surely know how to run a country.</p> <p>Yet politics, as we see all around us, is Great (or Lukewarm) Britannia plc. The chief executive isn't thanked, at some thinly attended AGM, for bringing overall crime levels down: he is kicked on the knee because teenagers keep nicking each other's mobile phones. He can open a new hospital every three days, but it's the one without a decent morgue that brings him down. And so it must be in this new, cold world of incessant targetting.</p> <p>Where does it come from? The answer, inevitably, is that it comes (along with so much else) from Bill Clinton's two terms and his partial reinvigoration of federal government. Bill showed the way. But Bill is gone this morning, and his usurper arrives promising to change this federal inheritance utterly, to break it down and scatter the pieces across 50 states. Many of Clinton's ideas may, in detail, have been good: but they float on a political tide which goes in and out, carrying its flotsam with it.</p> <p>And Clinton, at least, had an advantage that New Labour lacks. He could inspire affection - or the other side of its coin, loathing. He could engage emotions (from a girl in a stained dress to a black chapel filled with chanting adulation). There is something curiously chilly about his touring company's British version. It is, already, tolerated rather than loved. It will be re-elected soon enough, but with no more joy than a board of suits at a shareholders' meeting.</p> <p>Why this crucial lack of affection? Well, some people (old Labour, old Thatcher-lovers) are never happy. But the rest of us, in the middle, need something warm to identify with. Tony Blair could do warmth at the start, but the constant, frustrated recitation of statistics and complex initiatives has drained that from him. Worse, the beginnings of an election campaign - with its crude, argy-bargy statistics - undermines him further. He's effective CEO, he seems to say, of the NHS, of Railtrack, of the dome, of the Metropolitan police. An impossible spin.</p> <p>Of course, in reality, New Labour isn't a business at all. How could it be? Would any successful business temporise so long and so feebly about Europe? Would any business set up a tug of war between its chief executive and finance director which, over the years, it did nothing to resolve? Would it give that finance director, no matter how callow his underlings, a licence to veto the work of other, more expert departments? Would any ambitious business duck out of debates or get its marketing in such a twist?</p> <p>Governments are not giant corporations. They are, at best, the reconciler of hopes and reality. They can set a direction and, through prudent distancing, leave others to follow through. (That's the point about the American way: so much, for good or ill, is left to the states, so much can be mired in Congress). But New Labour, long out of power and thus short of experience, saw only detail, not strategy. Tony Blair became visibly enraged by the sluggard pace of Whitehall. Ministers became ciphers as he kicked the dozy machine. Targets showered from on high; and the essence of real achievement drained away, lost in a forest of benchmarks as frail as the first voter (or Daily Mail reporter) to stub his toe on one.</p> <p>In this dismal arena, one publicised failure equals a dozen successes. The more targets you set, the more certain you are to fail in individual perception. The more voluminous your target list, the less time you have to talk direction. Time will always betray you, because that is the nature of time in politics. One step forward will always be one step back when the next lot get in.</p> <p>If I were Mr Blair, I'd write a two-sentence manifesto. \"We've done a lot, as you can see, and we aim to do a lot more. Give us the chance to drive on while our energy lasts.\" And I'd make Geoff Mulgan visiting professor in governmental theory at Bath and Harvard. If there are no big ideas in an unideological world, let there at least be honest endeavour and constant dialogue - the tools of affection.

It seems strange then, that the ceremony began and ended with exclusively and overtly Christian prayers. Are the many non-believers, Jews, Hindus and Muslims not considered to be citizens of the US? Adrian Barnett Morecambe, Lancs. adrian@abarnett.demon.co.uk \u0095 How sadly apt that BBC2's coverage of Bush's inauguration should have been preceded by a John Wayne movie.

Michael Leahy, general secretary of the biggest steel workers' union, the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, said yesterday: \"Corus is going to make its most important decision ever. We hope the company has heeded our words and will tough it out until we are through the present difficult trading conditions. \"To make further redundancies or even to close a factory would be the worst decision not only for the company but also for the country.\" Bob Shannon, national officer of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, said: \"There is enormous speculation but we are waiting for the official announcement and we just hope that Corus will hold its nerve.\" In another landmark decision for British industry Japanese car firm Nissan is expected to announce this week whether it will build a new car at its plant in Sunderland or at a factory near Paris. The chances of Sunderland winning the work have been boosted after the European commission approved a \u00a340m government grant if the Micra is produced in this country. The Sunderland Nissan plant is one of the most productive in Europe and a decision to shut it would be blamed firmly on the high pound and Britain's failure to join the euro.",

With the brains of a Winchester and New College, Oxford, scholar, the training as a doctor at St George's and a psychiatrist at the Maudsley - and skills as a flyer and champion yachtsman - his highest parliamentary achievement was as chairman of the Commons catering committee and parliamentary private secretary to Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe and then Iain Macleod.

Founded by Carole Shepard in the USA (where else?) the website writes anonymously to fellow office workers, tactfully telling them they may need to improve their hygiene or habits. </p> <p>Personal hygiene problems covered on the website include nose-picking and body odour, while other letters broach the subjects of dressing provocatively, always being late and having bad dandruff. </p> <p>Shepard got the idea for the website after experiencing for herself the trauma of pungent colleagues. Initial responses have been positive and more than 70 anonymous letters are sent out by Shepard each week on behalf of workers at their wits' end. </p> <p>\"TN\" is one of the happy customers whose $9.95 was well spent. (S)he enthuses on the website \". . .Your letter surpassed my expectations. We had tried everything we could think of to get our coworker to use deodorant . . . Now we can breathe again . . .\" Don't you just love a happy, sweet-smelling ending? </p> <p>*Many thanks to Cathy Mowat of PricewaterhouseCoopers for her email responding to our report last week on the devaluation of work by bad spelling and poor grammar in the work place. </p> <p>A good example of said sloppiness, writes the impressively perceptive Pricewaterhouse-Coopers employee, is the advertisement placed in the Guardian by the General Teaching Council for England, the first line of which talks about \"it's own professional standards . . .\" </p> <p>A truly appalling mistake, as our reader points out. But at the same time Miss Cathy fails herself. She writes: \"If one cannot rely on an institution like that to get it right, who can we reply (sic) on !\" Sigh. For a moment then, WPM felt she had met her match. But disappointment reigns. She is once again left with the impression that there truly is no one as perfect and perceptive as she. </p> <p>*The way to the office staff's heart is through their stomachs. That's the message of Nimble, the UK's popular low-calorie bread, following a survey of office workers' early eating habits. The Nimble study shows that 10% of employees arrive at their workplace early in order to eat breakfast. And a further one in ten combine their morning munch with a breakfast meeting two or three times every week. Since almost four in 10 workers are eating breakfast at their desks every day, the Nimblers reckon that understanding bosses are catering for the trend by providing kettles, microwaves, toasters and even ovens for a lucky one in ten of the UK workforce. Following the results of the survey, WPM is thinking of asking for a fully fitted Andrew Macintosh kitchen at her desk area. All in the name of brain food, you understand.</p>",

The thing is, WPM doesn't want to take responsibility for the letter in case she is in any way seen as insensitive (and in case she gets found out). So, hail the arrival of CoWorkerHints.com - unquestionably our website of the week for its campaign to rid the office of unsavoury sights and smells. Founded by Carole Shepard in the USA (where else?) the website writes anonymously to fellow office workers, tactfully telling them they may need to improve their hygiene or habits. Personal hygiene problems covered on the website include nose-picking and body odour, while other letters broach the subjects of dressing provocatively, always being late and having bad dandruff. Shepard got the idea for the website after experiencing for herself the trauma of pungent colleagues. Initial responses have been positive and more than 70 anonymous letters are sent out by Shepard each week on behalf of workers at their wits' end. \"TN\" is one of the happy customers whose $9.95 was well spent. (S)he enthuses on the website \". . .Your letter surpassed my expectations. We had tried everything we could think of to get our coworker to use deodorant . . . Now we can breathe again . . .\" Don't you just love a happy, sweet-smelling ending? *Many thanks to Cathy Mowat of PricewaterhouseCoopers for her email responding to our report last week on the devaluation of work by bad spelling and poor grammar in the work place. A good example of said sloppiness, writes the impressively perceptive Pricewaterhouse-Coopers employee, is the advertisement placed in the Guardian by the General Teaching Council for England, the first line of which talks about \"it's own professional standards . . .\" A truly appalling mistake, as our reader points out. But at the same time Miss Cathy fails herself. She writes: \"If one cannot rely on an institution like that to get it right, who can we reply (sic) on !\" Sigh. For a moment then, WPM felt she had met her match. But disappointment reigns. She is once again left with the impression that there truly is no one as perfect and perceptive as she. *The way to the office staff's heart is through their stomachs. That's the message of Nimble, the UK's popular low-calorie bread, following a survey of office workers' early eating habits. The Nimble study shows that 10% of employees arrive at their workplace early in order to eat breakfast. And a further one in ten combine their morning munch with a breakfast meeting two or three times every week. Since almost four in 10 workers are eating breakfast at their desks every day, the Nimblers reckon that understanding bosses are catering for the trend by providing kettles, microwaves, toasters and even ovens for a lucky one in ten of the UK workforce. Following the results of the survey, WPM is thinking of asking for a fully fitted Andrew Macintosh kitchen at her desk area. All in the name of brain food, you understand.",

There is, though, no speech for new viewers explaining what his condition is. </p> <p>It increasingly seems to me that the most crucial question in making television programmes is: how much does the audience know? In news and documentary, the answer to this question sets the intellectual level of the product. In drama and comedy, the response decides whether the script can be allusive and subtle or filled with characters telling each other things they already know. Most British dramas follow the American tradition of the re-cap (\"Previously on this series...\"), but the test is most severe in the shift from pilot to series. </p> <p>My fear is that the second Second Sight is too repetitive if you saw the original, not echoey enough if you didn't. The system of piloting shows is designed to be more sensitive to the viewer but, in some cases, it works against the audience. </p> <p>\u0095 Second Sight, tonight, 9.10pm, BBC1</p>",

With the establishing episodes recently repeated to build interest in the series, a large percentage of viewers have already lived through Tanner's terrifying realisation that his vision is slipping. The solution in what might be called the second Second Sight is to run elegant variations on his difficulties: a hand-shake with a stranger becomes like finding the light-switch at night, he trails his fingers along the nearest wall in a mannerism which looks idle but is vital. There is, though, no speech for new viewers explaining what his condition is. It increasingly seems to me that the most crucial question in making television programmes is: how much does the audience know? In news and documentary, the answer to this question sets the intellectual level of the product. In drama and comedy, the response decides whether the script can be allusive and subtle or filled with characters telling each other things they already know. Most British dramas follow the American tradition of the re-cap (\"Previously on this series...\"), but the test is most severe in the shift from pilot to series. My fear is that the second Second Sight is too repetitive if you saw the original, not echoey enough if you didn't. The system of piloting shows is designed to be more sensitive to the viewer but, in some cases, it works against the audience. \u0095 Second Sight, tonight, 9.10pm, BBC1",

      "byline": "Marcel Berlins and Clare Dyer",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On the very day that the appeal court described the jury's verdict in the Bruce Grobbelaar libel trial in the most damning terms that judges can muster, virtually calling the jurors mad, another 12 men and women, in Manchester, were doing their bit to be added to the roll-call of juries for whom \"perverse\" is an honourable label. They brought in a verdict of not guilty on two anti-nuclear protesters charged with conspiracy to cause criminal damage to a Trident submarine in a Barrow-in-Furness shipyard. The two happily admitted their intention to trash the sub but said they were doing so because nuclear weapons were immoral and illegal. The judge told the jury that such ideals formed no defence against the charge. He was ignored. Not guilty, said the jury.</p> <p>It was not the first time that juries have, apparently contrary to the evidence, acquitted defendants charged with sabotage of defence equipment. But that strand of acquittals is itself part of a greater English tradition, going back to the trial of William Mead and William Penn, nonconformists charged in 1670 with unlawful preaching and conducting a seditious assembly. The jury was threatened by the judge and locked up for two nights \"without meat, drink, fire or tobacco\" after it refused to convict them but still stubbornly stuck to its verdict. The jurors were then fined and imprisoned till they paid, but were ultimately released by the Chief Justice, upholding \"the right of juries to give their verdict by their conscience\".</p> <p>A perverse verdict could just mean - as in the Grobbelaar case - a totally unreasonable conclusion from the evidence presented. But the more distinguished form of jury perversity arises when jurors in a criminal trial, following their consciences and their moral beliefs, acquit a defendant even where the evidence and the law clearly point to conviction. Lord Devlin, one of the great law lords, regarded the jury's right to bring in a perverse acquittal as one of the glories of our jury system. \"It gives protection against laws which the ordinary man regards as harsh and oppressive . . . an insurance that the criminal law will conform to the ordinary man's ideas of what is fair and just. If it does not, the jury will not be a party to its enforcement.\"</p> <p>In 1985, Clive Ponting, a senior Ministry of Defence official, was tried under the Official Secrets Act for revealing to an MP that government ministers had misled Parliament over the sinking of the Argentine warship General Belgrano during the Falklands War. There was no doubt that he had done so and that he had no legal defence to the charge, as the trial judge made clear to the jury. Nevertheless the jury acquitted him. Jurors may not be asked why they reached a particular verdict, but it emerged that some of them resented the patronising and over-emphatic way in which the trial judge, in effect, ordered them to convict. Another factor was the feeling that the \"catch-all\" section of the Official Secrets Act under which Ponting was charged and which allowed no public interest defence was unfair and oppressive.</p> <p>Even more striking was the acquittal at the Old Bailey in 1990 of Pat Pottle and Michael Randle, on a charge of helping the Soviet spy George Blake escape from Wormwood Scrubs in 1963, enabling him to flee to Russia. This was not just a case of a jury disregarding the judge's clear - and legally correct - instruction that the two men had no defence. The jury knew for a fact that they were guilty - not least because they had published a book entitled The Blake Escape - How We Freed George Blake and Why. As if that wasn't enough, Pottle and Randle, defending themselves, confirmed their responsibility for the crime and made impassioned speeches from the dock. They argued that bringing them to court 26 years after the crime was an abuse of the legal process and showed a political motive behind their prosecution. The jury was clearly impressed and acquitted, knowing that it was delivering a perverse verdict, showing two fingers to a system that would behave in this way. Nor is it just in highly publicised cases raising quasi-political or social issues that juries have shown their bolshie independence. Away from the headlines, juries often acquit guilty defendants simply because they feel strongly that no prosecution should have been brought. Forgetful elderly shoplifters are frequent beneficiaries of jury anger at their being in the dock at all.</p> <p>In the 19th century, juries used to find defendants not guilty of crimes they had clearly committed because the penalties - a death sentence or long imprisonment - were so disproportionate to the crime (stealing a sheep, for instance). The modern equivalent is the jury that refuses to convict a mercy killer of murder, even when all the ingredients of the crime are present, because a murder conviction means an automatic life sentence. The result is that mercy killers often escape with a conviction for manslaughter, and a lighter sentence, on the often spurious grounds of diminished responsibility.</p> <p>Peace protestors have a long record of successful appeals to the jury's conscience. In the 1970s a group led by the well-known campaigner Pat Arrowsmith were charged under the 1934 Disaffection Act for leafleting troops at Aldershot and acquitted after a 51-day trial, despite overwhelming evidence against them. The trial took place before the Contempt of Court Act 1981 put a firm lid on jury revelations, and some jurors revealed afterwards that they had made up their minds to clear the defendants after just five days.</p> <p>In recent years lawyers have put forward ingenious defences to con vince juries to acquit their clients. A string of anti-nuclear protesters including Sylvia Boyes and Keith Wright, the anti-Trident activists acquitted last week, have pleaded that their actions were necessary to prevent a greater evil. The pair, members of Trident Ploughshares, were caught in wet suits near the Trident submarine Vengeance, docked in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, in November 1999. They were carrying hammers, an axe and six cans of aerosol polish and admitted they intended to damage the sub, which was equipped to carry one-quarter of Britain's nuclear arsenal. They were acquitted of conspiracy to cause criminal damage by a Manchester jury after arguing that their actions were justified because nuclear weapons were immoral and in breach of international law. Politicians could not be trusted to act, so they had to step in to prevent disaster. In 1996 a Liverpool jury similarly acquitted two women charged with causing \u00a31.5m damage to a Hawk fighter jet to prevent its use in the bombing of East Timor by Indonesia, contravening international law.</p> <p>In another series of prosecutions, people with multiple sclerosis or other painful illnesses charged with using, growing or supplying cannabis have pleaded that the drug was the only means of relieving their pain. Juries have acquitted almost all those accused. Last September, Lord Melchett, executive director of Greenpeace, and 27 other environmental activists who trashed a field of genetically modified maize in Norfolk in July 1999 successfully pleaded that their action was justified to prevent the contamination of nearby organic crops. Under the Criminal Damage Act 1971, an accused has a defence if he acted to protect other property that he believed was in imminent danger, using means that he believed reasonable in the circumstances. Maybe the jury really believed the Greenpeace 28 were justified in their aim of uprooting the whole crop to prevent flowering and pollination, possibly contaminating nearby crops. Or maybe, like many of their fellow citizens, they just didn't like the idea of GM foods. Scimac, the industry body representing the company that developed the GM maize, said after the trial that the verdict raised \"fundamental questions about the ability of our legal system to cope with the gradual erosion of respect for public rights and authority\".</p> <p>Perverse verdicts show that juries don't like stigmatising people they don't really regard as criminals. It offends them to have to convict an MS sufferer who takes a few illegal puffs to alleviate pain. They're also reluctant to make criminals out of defendants who think like them and have the same world view. And jurors don't want to risk sending to prison those who act out of genuine public interest or moral concern, even if they break the letter of the law.

      "bodyText": "On the very day that the appeal court described the jury's verdict in the Bruce Grobbelaar libel trial in the most damning terms that judges can muster, virtually calling the jurors mad, another 12 men and women, in Manchester, were doing their bit to be added to the roll-call of juries for whom \"perverse\" is an honourable label. They brought in a verdict of not guilty on two anti-nuclear protesters charged with conspiracy to cause criminal damage to a Trident submarine in a Barrow-in-Furness shipyard. The two happily admitted their intention to trash the sub but said they were doing so because nuclear weapons were immoral and illegal. The judge told the jury that such ideals formed no defence against the charge. He was ignored. Not guilty, said the jury. It was not the first time that juries have, apparently contrary to the evidence, acquitted defendants charged with sabotage of defence equipment. But that strand of acquittals is itself part of a greater English tradition, going back to the trial of William Mead and William Penn, nonconformists charged in 1670 with unlawful preaching and conducting a seditious assembly. The jury was threatened by the judge and locked up for two nights \"without meat, drink, fire or tobacco\" after it refused to convict them but still stubbornly stuck to its verdict. The jurors were then fined and imprisoned till they paid, but were ultimately released by the Chief Justice, upholding \"the right of juries to give their verdict by their conscience\". A perverse verdict could just mean - as in the Grobbelaar case - a totally unreasonable conclusion from the evidence presented. But the more distinguished form of jury perversity arises when jurors in a criminal trial, following their consciences and their moral beliefs, acquit a defendant even where the evidence and the law clearly point to conviction. Lord Devlin, one of the great law lords, regarded the jury's right to bring in a perverse acquittal as one of the glories of our jury system. \"It gives protection against laws which the ordinary man regards as harsh and oppressive . . . an insurance that the criminal law will conform to the ordinary man's ideas of what is fair and just. If it does not, the jury will not be a party to its enforcement.\" In 1985, Clive Ponting, a senior Ministry of Defence official, was tried under the Official Secrets Act for revealing to an MP that government ministers had misled Parliament over the sinking of the Argentine warship General Belgrano during the Falklands War. There was no doubt that he had done so and that he had no legal defence to the charge, as the trial judge made clear to the jury. Nevertheless the jury acquitted him. Jurors may not be asked why they reached a particular verdict, but it emerged that some of them resented the patronising and over-emphatic way in which the trial judge, in effect, ordered them to convict. Another factor was the feeling that the \"catch-all\" section of the Official Secrets Act under which Ponting was charged and which allowed no public interest defence was unfair and oppressive. Even more striking was the acquittal at the Old Bailey in 1990 of Pat Pottle and Michael Randle, on a charge of helping the Soviet spy George Blake escape from Wormwood Scrubs in 1963, enabling him to flee to Russia. This was not just a case of a jury disregarding the judge's clear - and legally correct - instruction that the two men had no defence. The jury knew for a fact that they were guilty - not least because they had published a book entitled The Blake Escape - How We Freed George Blake and Why. As if that wasn't enough, Pottle and Randle, defending themselves, confirmed their responsibility for the crime and made impassioned speeches from the dock. They argued that bringing them to court 26 years after the crime was an abuse of the legal process and showed a political motive behind their prosecution. The jury was clearly impressed and acquitted, knowing that it was delivering a perverse verdict, showing two fingers to a system that would behave in this way. Nor is it just in highly publicised cases raising quasi-political or social issues that juries have shown their bolshie independence. Away from the headlines, juries often acquit guilty defendants simply because they feel strongly that no prosecution should have been brought. Forgetful elderly shoplifters are frequent beneficiaries of jury anger at their being in the dock at all. In the 19th century, juries used to find defendants not guilty of crimes they had clearly committed because the penalties - a death sentence or long imprisonment - were so disproportionate to the crime (stealing a sheep, for instance). The modern equivalent is the jury that refuses to convict a mercy killer of murder, even when all the ingredients of the crime are present, because a murder conviction means an automatic life sentence. The result is that mercy killers often escape with a conviction for manslaughter, and a lighter sentence, on the often spurious grounds of diminished responsibility. Peace protestors have a long record of successful appeals to the jury's conscience. In the 1970s a group led by the well-known campaigner Pat Arrowsmith were charged under the 1934 Disaffection Act for leafleting troops at Aldershot and acquitted after a 51-day trial, despite overwhelming evidence against them. The trial took place before the Contempt of Court Act 1981 put a firm lid on jury revelations, and some jurors revealed afterwards that they had made up their minds to clear the defendants after just five days. In recent years lawyers have put forward ingenious defences to con vince juries to acquit their clients. A string of anti-nuclear protesters including Sylvia Boyes and Keith Wright, the anti-Trident activists acquitted last week, have pleaded that their actions were necessary to prevent a greater evil. The pair, members of Trident Ploughshares, were caught in wet suits near the Trident submarine Vengeance, docked in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, in November 1999. They were carrying hammers, an axe and six cans of aerosol polish and admitted they intended to damage the sub, which was equipped to carry one-quarter of Britain's nuclear arsenal. They were acquitted of conspiracy to cause criminal damage by a Manchester jury after arguing that their actions were justified because nuclear weapons were immoral and in breach of international law. Politicians could not be trusted to act, so they had to step in to prevent disaster. In 1996 a Liverpool jury similarly acquitted two women charged with causing \u00a31.5m damage to a Hawk fighter jet to prevent its use in the bombing of East Timor by Indonesia, contravening international law. In another series of prosecutions, people with multiple sclerosis or other painful illnesses charged with using, growing or supplying cannabis have pleaded that the drug was the only means of relieving their pain. Juries have acquitted almost all those accused. Last September, Lord Melchett, executive director of Greenpeace, and 27 other environmental activists who trashed a field of genetically modified maize in Norfolk in July 1999 successfully pleaded that their action was justified to prevent the contamination of nearby organic crops. Under the Criminal Damage Act 1971, an accused has a defence if he acted to protect other property that he believed was in imminent danger, using means that he believed reasonable in the circumstances. Maybe the jury really believed the Greenpeace 28 were justified in their aim of uprooting the whole crop to prevent flowering and pollination, possibly contaminating nearby crops. Or maybe, like many of their fellow citizens, they just didn't like the idea of GM foods. Scimac, the industry body representing the company that developed the GM maize, said after the trial that the verdict raised \"fundamental questions about the ability of our legal system to cope with the gradual erosion of respect for public rights and authority\". Perverse verdicts show that juries don't like stigmatising people they don't really regard as criminals. It offends them to have to convict an MS sufferer who takes a few illegal puffs to alleviate pain. They're also reluctant to make criminals out of defendants who think like them and have the same world view. And jurors don't want to risk sending to prison those who act out of genuine public interest or moral concern, even if they break the letter of the law. Most juries heed the judge's warnings and convict on the evidence, not on their feelings. But more and more jurors, it seems, are following their consciences. Perverse verdicts are on the rise.",

      "body": "<p>You can't help feeling a bit like Fox Mulder when you sit down with Graham Ennis in a cheap Brighton eatery called Food for Friends - where everybody really does know his name - and within minutes he has filled your head with tales of secret American weapons programmes, mysterious FBI raids and extraordinary happenings in labs in Russia and Brazil.</p> <p>When my taxi stopped outside the cafe, the meter read \u00a33. Before I could pay, the driver's mobile phone rang and he answered it. As he spoke, the meter restarted itself and began counting up in 20p intervals. By the time the driver had finished his short conversation, the meter read \u00a35.</p> <p>I pointed this out to the driver, who nodded. \"It always does that when the mobile rings,\" he said, charging me the original fare. This really happened. But who would believe such an X Files moment? Not the Guardian's expenses watchdogs. Ennis does, though.</p> <p>Although he sometimes describes himself as a scientist, Ennis is not one, at least not in the way most scientists would understand the word. He is largely self-taught; he doesn't have a degree or hold a post at any university or institute. His work experience has been a series of engineering jobs and a personally traumatic effort to help out in the Bosnian conflict.</p> <p>Yet he was able to persuade an eclectic international group of largely obscure scientists to come together in Brighton last weekend to discuss two of the weirdest, most far-out ideas in modern physics: the notion that we could generate beams of gravitational energy to nudge things around in space; and that scientists could draw limitless amounts of energy from a vacuum. Put together, the two would mean cheap and easy space travel.</p> <p>\"I'm not an inventor,\" said Ennis, a big, bearded 59-year-old. \"I'm not one of those classic guys who sits in a garden shed on their own. I don't even have a garden. I live in a flat on the waterfront. I'm a great networker. Science doesn't progress because of single ideas of single scientists.\"</p> <p>There is a gigantic credibility gap. Most physicists put the second idea, known as zero point energy, in the same category as cold fusion, perpet ual motion machines and Nazi bombers on the moon. The theory of \"electrogravity\", however, is winning a few supporters. It is even winning research grants. Nasa has funded electrogravity research since the mid-1990s. Last year the Guardian disclosed that British Aerospace was backing similar experiments at Lancaster University under the name Project Greenglow. Sheffield University researchers are also investigating the theory.</p> <p>\"It is being taken more seriously,\" said Professor Richard Holdaway, of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, which sent a delegate to the Brighton workshop. \"It's spreading not just through the astrophysics community but particle physics as well, and people at Cern [the European nuclear research organisation based in Geneva] are now getting interested. There are many sceptics, as there were with black holes 25 years ago. One of the things we do here is keep an open mind.\"</p> <p>The latest wave of controversy over gravity beams began with the claim in 1996 by a Russian scientist, Yevgeny Podkletnov, that he had been able to create a column of reduced gravity above and below a foot-wide ceramic disc by cooling it to a few degrees above absolute zero (-273C) and bombarding it with microwaves.</p> <p>There was a world of problems with his claim. It was due to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, but never was. The reduction in gravity was tiny - a little over 2%. And Podkletnov could not make it work in the same way every time. Yet it was intriguing enough for a series of scientists to try to reproduce the effect, so far without success. There are rumours that secret US military labs have also been stumped.</p> <p>Podkletnov - who has been to Britain and the US to advise scientists on creating the right discs - was ridiculed, along with Nasa, in the physicist Robert Park's book Voodoo Science. Park, somewhat unfairly, accused the scientists involved of breaking a basic law of physics by thinking they could get more energy out than they put in. In fact, if Podkletnov's work can be reproduced, it will take a lot of electricity to produce a weak gravitational beam.</p> <p>Other scientists, such as the US researcher Ning Li, have tried to find a theoretical basis for gravity beams. They have fastened on to a state of matter predicted by Albert Einstein and the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose called a Bose-Einstein condensate, in which matter gets so cold - a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute zero - that its individual atoms cease to operate separately and act, collectively, as a single giant particle. Li argues that by manipulating such atoms with a magnetic field, they could be aligned and made to spin in such a way that they would project a beam of repulsive or attractive gravitational force.</p> <p>What is the point? It would be an extraordinary scientific achievement if it could be shown that gravity beams could be made in the lab. But even if the principle was proved, it looks doubtful that a gravitational thruster could be made powerful enough to lift its own weight, plus its electric generators and fuel, off the ground. So no antigravity scooters any time soon.</p> <p>The reason for the money from the likes of BAe and the Pentagon is the military potential of a ground-based gravity beam. It could be used to shoot down aircraft. It could be used to answer America's obsession with protecting itself from missile attack. Ennis feels, uncomfortably, the influence on research of the British equivalents of the Men in Black - the Men in Blue Wool Mix, perhaps.</p> <p>Ennis made himself the lynchpin of the European electrogravity community by the simple expedient of reading everything he could find about it on the web (much of it to be found on sites about UFOs and Pentagon cover-ups) and setting up an internet newsgroup for the like-minded, including scientists and non-scientists.</p> <p>\"I think Graham Ennis has done us all a favour, at some personal risk, in getting people together,\" said John Allen, a visiting professor in aeronautics at Kingston University, a veteran of more than half a century of aircraft and rocket design, and one of the speakers at the workshop. \"These are very speculative areas, associated with quite a lot of spurious rubbish.

      "bodyText": "You can't help feeling a bit like Fox Mulder when you sit down with Graham Ennis in a cheap Brighton eatery called Food for Friends - where everybody really does know his name - and within minutes he has filled your head with tales of secret American weapons programmes, mysterious FBI raids and extraordinary happenings in labs in Russia and Brazil. When my taxi stopped outside the cafe, the meter read \u00a33. Before I could pay, the driver's mobile phone rang and he answered it. As he spoke, the meter restarted itself and began counting up in 20p intervals. By the time the driver had finished his short conversation, the meter read \u00a35. I pointed this out to the driver, who nodded. \"It always does that when the mobile rings,\" he said, charging me the original fare. This really happened. But who would believe such an X Files moment? Not the Guardian's expenses watchdogs. Ennis does, though. Although he sometimes describes himself as a scientist, Ennis is not one, at least not in the way most scientists would understand the word. He is largely self-taught; he doesn't have a degree or hold a post at any university or institute. His work experience has been a series of engineering jobs and a personally traumatic effort to help out in the Bosnian conflict. Yet he was able to persuade an eclectic international group of largely obscure scientists to come together in Brighton last weekend to discuss two of the weirdest, most far-out ideas in modern physics: the notion that we could generate beams of gravitational energy to nudge things around in space; and that scientists could draw limitless amounts of energy from a vacuum. Put together, the two would mean cheap and easy space travel. \"I'm not an inventor,\" said Ennis, a big, bearded 59-year-old. \"I'm not one of those classic guys who sits in a garden shed on their own. I don't even have a garden. I live in a flat on the waterfront. I'm a great networker. Science doesn't progress because of single ideas of single scientists.\" There is a gigantic credibility gap. Most physicists put the second idea, known as zero point energy, in the same category as cold fusion, perpet ual motion machines and Nazi bombers on the moon. The theory of \"electrogravity\", however, is winning a few supporters. It is even winning research grants. Nasa has funded electrogravity research since the mid-1990s. Last year the Guardian disclosed that British Aerospace was backing similar experiments at Lancaster University under the name Project Greenglow. Sheffield University researchers are also investigating the theory. \"It is being taken more seriously,\" said Professor Richard Holdaway, of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, which sent a delegate to the Brighton workshop. \"It's spreading not just through the astrophysics community but particle physics as well, and people at Cern [the European nuclear research organisation based in Geneva] are now getting interested. There are many sceptics, as there were with black holes 25 years ago. One of the things we do here is keep an open mind.\" The latest wave of controversy over gravity beams began with the claim in 1996 by a Russian scientist, Yevgeny Podkletnov, that he had been able to create a column of reduced gravity above and below a foot-wide ceramic disc by cooling it to a few degrees above absolute zero (-273C) and bombarding it with microwaves. There was a world of problems with his claim. It was due to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, but never was. The reduction in gravity was tiny - a little over 2%. And Podkletnov could not make it work in the same way every time. Yet it was intriguing enough for a series of scientists to try to reproduce the effect, so far without success. There are rumours that secret US military labs have also been stumped. Podkletnov - who has been to Britain and the US to advise scientists on creating the right discs - was ridiculed, along with Nasa, in the physicist Robert Park's book Voodoo Science. Park, somewhat unfairly, accused the scientists involved of breaking a basic law of physics by thinking they could get more energy out than they put in. In fact, if Podkletnov's work can be reproduced, it will take a lot of electricity to produce a weak gravitational beam. Other scientists, such as the US researcher Ning Li, have tried to find a theoretical basis for gravity beams. They have fastened on to a state of matter predicted by Albert Einstein and the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose called a Bose-Einstein condensate, in which matter gets so cold - a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute zero - that its individual atoms cease to operate separately and act, collectively, as a single giant particle. Li argues that by manipulating such atoms with a magnetic field, they could be aligned and made to spin in such a way that they would project a beam of repulsive or attractive gravitational force. What is the point? It would be an extraordinary scientific achievement if it could be shown that gravity beams could be made in the lab. But even if the principle was proved, it looks doubtful that a gravitational thruster could be made powerful enough to lift its own weight, plus its electric generators and fuel, off the ground. So no antigravity scooters any time soon. The reason for the money from the likes of BAe and the Pentagon is the military potential of a ground-based gravity beam. It could be used to shoot down aircraft. It could be used to answer America's obsession with protecting itself from missile attack. Ennis feels, uncomfortably, the influence on research of the British equivalents of the Men in Black - the Men in Blue Wool Mix, perhaps. Ennis made himself the lynchpin of the European electrogravity community by the simple expedient of reading everything he could find about it on the web (much of it to be found on sites about UFOs and Pentagon cover-ups) and setting up an internet newsgroup for the like-minded, including scientists and non-scientists. \"I think Graham Ennis has done us all a favour, at some personal risk, in getting people together,\" said John Allen, a visiting professor in aeronautics at Kingston University, a veteran of more than half a century of aircraft and rocket design, and one of the speakers at the workshop. \"These are very speculative areas, associated with quite a lot of spurious rubbish. But if you went back to 1850, where a lot of people were struggling to get manned flight to work, no one knew whether it would work or not.\" Ennis does not make it easy for you to take him seriously. He believes not just in the future of gravity beams but in zero point energy. He thinks cold fusion - now thoroughly discredited - has not been given a chance. His email name is \"kklingon\". One of the more eminent speakers listed on the workshop website, approached by the Guardian, said he had never even been invited; among the delegates Ning Li, Yevgeny Podkletnov and the head of Nasa's breakthrough propulsion research are notable by their absence. \"This started out as a way of stopping myself going mad as I was stuck in my flat with severe cardiac problems,\" said Ennis. \"But it also helped me develop my mind again.\" There is something personal, and very British, about Ennis's urgent desire to see his country investing in these still-reviled areas of research. His dream is to see fleets of British spacecraft floating off into deep space. Brought up overseas by a father who began as an apprentice in a flying circus and ended up as a senior engineer for BA, he is of the generation that thought Britain could trade in its empire for a world lead in high technology, only to see project after project fizzle out through lack of funds and public indifference. \"We would have had an aircraft industry as big as America's had we not been betrayed by politicians and civil servants,\" he said. \"It happened before with Frank Whittle and the jet engine.

What about our own dear queen? 49 years and counting, but that still leaves her 15 short of the UK all-comers' record. Dates please: Victoria became queen in 1837, aged 18, and reigned until 1901. The world record is held by Louis XIV of France, who reigned for 72 years, but he was only four when he became king so that doesn't count. Ah, the Fun King. The Sun King actually, but we digress. We are here to celebrate the life of one of Britain's top monarchs. Why was she so great? Not so much great as lucky. Succeeded young, lived a long time and presided over one of the most glittering periods of British history. We ruled the planet, were economic top dogs, were world-beaters at cricket (not counting the Australian Convicts XI), and our TV was the best in the world. TV hadn't been invented. I was speaking metaphorically. It was a fantastic time to be alive, unless you were old, poor or disease-ridden. And if you were? It was less fantastic. Did Victoria think it was fantastic? Yes, until 1861, when her beloved husband, Prince Albert, died. Less so afterwards. It took her years to recover from his death, and every day until she died his clothes were laid out at Windsor and a bowl of hot water was prepared for him to shave. Spooky, eh? What about that bloke in a kilt? You mean John Brown, her faithful gillie. Is that what they call it? What are you implying? Take your lurid allegations to the Sun.

      "body": "<p>Hey, man.\" Jonathan Wayne Nobles grins through inch-thick wire-reinforced glass, hunching over to speak in a deep, resonant voice through the steel grate below. A feeble, \"What's up?\" is the best I can manage. The visiting area in Ellis One Unit is crowded with other folks who have travelled, in some cases thousands of miles, to visit relatives and correspondents on Texas's death row. They sit at intervals in wooden chairs surrounding a cinder-block and steel cage that dominates the centre of the room. There are cages within the cage as well, reserved for inmates under disciplinary action and \"death-watch\" status. Falling into the latter category, Jon must squeeze his considerable bulk into one of these phone-booth-sized enclosures.</p> <p>It's an awkward moment for both of us. In the 10 years we have corresponded, we have never met face to face. The occasion is auspicious. Jon and I will spend eight hours a day together for the next three days and another three days next week. Then the state of Texas will transport Jon, chained hand and foot, 11 miles to the Walls unit in downtown Huntsville. There he will be pumped full of chemicals that will collapse his lungs and stop his heart for ever. This is not a worst-case scenario. It is a certainty. Jonathan Nobles has precisely 10 days to live. And I, at Jon's request, will attend the execution as one of his witnesses.</p> <p>Over the next few days a routine develops. I arrive at Ellis at 8.30am. We usually spend the first two hours talking about music, politics, religion - subjects that we have covered thoroughly enough in letters over the years to know that we have widely divergent views and tastes. We fill the long awkward silences that seem inevitable in prison visiting areas with trips to the vending machines for soft drinks, candy, and potato chips. I pass Jon's goodies to the guard on duty through a small opening in the steel mesh.</p> <p>Inevitably, we move on to life behind bars, drugs, and recovery-topics where we share considerably more common ground. We are both recovering addicts who got clean only when we were locked up. Jon began reading about recovery and attending 12-step meetings in prison years ago. I can remember a time, back when I was still using drugs, when the recovery-speak that filled his letters made me extremely uncomfortable. Now it is a language that we share - sort of a spiritual shorthand that cuts through the testosterone and affords us a convenient, if uncomfortable, segue to the business at hand.</p> <p>There are arrangements to be made. If Jon's body were to go unclaimed, as is the case with half of the men executed in Texas, he would be buried in the prison cemetery on the outskirts of Huntsville. Called Peckerwood Hill by the locals, it is a lonely space filled with concrete crosses, adorned only with the interred inmates' prison numbers. Those executed by the state are easily identifiable by the \"X\" preceding their number. There are no names on the stones. Jon doesn't want to wind up there.</p> <p>Instead, he wants to be buried in Oxford, England - a place he's never seen. One of his pen pals, a British woman named Pam Thomas, has described it to him in her letters. He likes the picture Pam paints of the springtime there, when the bluebells are in bloom. Jon says that Pam is working on permission from a landowner there. I have plan B on the back burner. A Dominican community in Galway, Ireland, has offered Jon a final resting place. At some point in the proceedings it dawns on me that I have spent the past hour helping a living, breathing man plan his own burial.</p> <p>One thing Jon and I don't talk about much is the movement to abolish the death penalty. In fact, Jon is suspicious of abolitionists. We were \"introduced\" by a pen pal of his and an acquaintance of mine. She had heard that I sometimes corresponded with inmates and asked if she could give Jon my address. I said sure. Within a month, I received my first letter. It was a page and a half long in a beautiful flowing script. It contained a lot of the usual tough rhetoric and dark humour I had learned to expect in letters from inmates. After several readings, I realised that the jailhouse small talk was merely a medium, a vehicle for one pertinent piece of information-that Jonathan Wayne Nobles was guilty of the crimes he was charged with.</p> <p>In 1986 Jon was convicted (almost entirely on the strength of his own confession) of stabbing Kelley Farquhar and Mitzi Johnson-Nalley to death. He also admitted stabbing Ron Ross, Nalley's boyfriend, who lost an eye in the attack. Jon never took the stand during his trial. He sat impassively as the guilty verdict was read and, according to newspaper accounts, only flinched slightly when district judge Bob Jones sentenced him to death.</p> <p>When Jon arrived at Ellis he quickly alienated all the guards and most of the inmates. He once broke away from guards while returning to his cell from the exercise yard and climbed the exposed pipes and bars in the cell block, kicking down television sets suspended outside on the bottom tier. On another occasion he cut himself with a razor blade, knowing that the guards would have to open his cell to prevent him from bleeding to death. He just wanted to hit one officer before he passed out.</p> <p>But somehow, somewhere along the line, in what is arguably the most inhumane environment in the \"civilised\" world, Jonathan Nobles began to change. He became interested in Catholicism and began to attend Mass. He befriended the Catholic clergy who ministered in the prison system, including members of the Dominican Order of Preachers. He eventually became a lay member of the order and ministered to his fellow inmates, even standing as godfather at the baptism of inmate Cliff Boggess. He later helped officiate at the Mass celebrated the night before Boggess was executed. I watched this transformation in the letters that I received.</p> <p>The Jonathan Nobles who sits on the other side of the glass from me in September 1998 is a different man from the one the state of Texas sentenced to die almost 12 years ago. The greatest evidence of this is the way Jon is treated by everyone he encounters. A prison clerk, displaying genuine regret, interrupts our visit. She needs Jon to sign some papers. Jon does so and then informs me that the documents allow me to pick up his personal property and distribute it to a list of people detailed in a note the clerk will hand me on my way out. Inmate James Beathard, on his way down the line to visit with a family member, stops to talk and Jon introduces us. The guard patiently waits until the exchange is over before escorting him to his assigned cubicle. Socialisation during inmate transfer is a clear violation of policy, but a lot of the rules have relaxed for Jon. He says it's like the last week of the school year. I believe it's more likely that he has earned the genuine respect of everyone here.</p> <p>I excuse myself to go to the bathroom. The truth is, I simply need a break. On the way back I run into Father Stephen Walsh, a Franciscan friar from Boston who travels regularly to minister to the Catholic inmates at Ellis. He will serve as Jonathan's spiritual adviser, waiting with him in the holding cell over at the Walls until he's escorted into the death chamber itself. There he will administer the last rites.</p> <p>Every visit ends the same way. A guard gives us a five-minute warning, and Jon hurriedly dictates a list of \"things to do\" that I must commit to memory, since visitors are not allowed to bring writing instruments and paper into the unit. Then Jon presses his palm against the glass and I mirror his with mine. He says: \"I love you. I'll see you tomorrow.\"</p> <p>Over the past few days the other witnesses have arrived in Huntsville. I had dinner with Dona Hucka, Jon's aunt. She is the only blood relative to make the trip and she has driven all night to be here. Pam Thomas is in from England. Both are already on the unit when I arrive. We take turns leaning close to the glass while a prison employee takes Polaroid snapshots of each of us with Jon. The prison provides this service for a fee of $8 (\u00a35.50) each.</p> <p>It's 10am. There isn't much time left. At 12.30 we will be asked to leave the unit and Jon will be transported to the Walls. In the death chamber, we will be able to hear Jon over a speaker in the witness room, but this is our last opportunity to speak to him. Jon divides the remaining time between us more or less equally. I go first. Jon looks tired; the stress is showing for the first time. He leans down and motions me closer. I realise he's assessing my condition as well. \"You all right, man?\" I tell him that I'm OK. Jon is not convinced.</p> <p>\"I'm worried about you. You don't have to be Superman or nothin'. This is insane shit that's goin' on here today. You don't have to be strong for the women, if that's what you're thinkin'. They're big girls. You need to take care of yourself.\"</p> <p>\"I know, Jon. I'm all right. I went to a meeting last night and my manager's here now. I've also got a couple of friends up from Houston who have done this before.\"</p> <p>\"Witnessed?\"</p> <p>\"Yeah.\" That seemed to make him feel better. \"OK, but if you need to cry, it's all right. Go ahead and cry.\"</p> <p>\"When this is all over, I'll cry.\"</p> <p>\"Promise?\"</p> <p>\"I promise.\"</p> <p>Jon shifts gears suddenly. Back to business. He looks both ways to make sure the guard isn't watching. \"Take this.\" With much effort he pushes a tiny slip of tightly rolled paper, the diameter of a toothpick, through the impossibly tight mesh. Somehow he pulls it off. \"That's my daughter's phone number in California. My sister read it to me over the phone last night. They're going to strip search me and I can't take anything to the Walls and I'm afraid I'll forget it. Give it to Father Walsh. Then I'll have it when I make my last phone calls.\"</p> <p>I poke the paper in the watch pocket of my Levi's. There are a few other requests. He wants me to call his foster mother and his sister after the execution, and send flowers to two women who worked for the prison who were kind to him over the years. I promise that I won't forget. \"All right, bro. Take care of yourself and your kids. Tell Dona to come back.\" Hands against the glass one last time.</p> <p>\"I love you, Jonathan.\"</p> <p>\"I love you too, bro.\"</p> <p>Noon. I head back into Huntsville. My manager, Dan Gillis, arrived last night and not a moment too soon. Suddenly, driving has become difficult. The world has taken on a kind of surrealistic patina. I need someone to drive for the rest of the day. Also waiting at the hotel are two friends from the abolition movement, Karen Sebung and Ward Larkin. Both have witnessed executions, and they have made the trip to assist in any way they can. We talk over arrangements for the transportation and cremation of Jon's body, which, as it turns out, Dan has already taken care of. I make a couple of phone calls and check my messages. Then I shower, shave, and put on a pair of black jeans, a blue short-sleeve shirt, and a black linen sport coat.</p> <p>4pm. We leave the hotel. Dan drives us to Hospitality House, a guest residence operated by the Baptist Church for the families of inmates. Dona and Pam, as well as Pam's friend Caroline, are staying there. The two other witnesses, Bishop Carmody of the East Texas diocese and the Reverend Richard Lopez of the Texas Department of Corrections are already there when we arrive. We are assembled here for an orientation session to be conducted by the Reverend Jim Brazzil, chaplain at the Walls unit. He and the warden will be the only two people inside the chamber with Jon when he dies. He goes through the execution process step-by-step so that we will know what to expect and, though it's obvious he speaks with authority, I'm not listening. I can't concentrate, so I just nod a lot. It doesn't matter. No matter how well or poorly the witnesses are prepared, they are going to kill Jon anyway.</p> <p>5.05pm. Reverend Brazzil answers his cell phone. It's Father Walsh, who's over at the Walls with Jon and wants the phone number, the one that he passed me through the . . . oh my God. I can't find it. I was sure that I transferred the slip from my other jeans into my wallet when I changed clothes, but it's simply not there. Dan runs to the motel and checks my room, but it's hopeless. Reverend Brazzil relays the bad news to Father Walsh. I feel awful.</p> <p>5.30pm. We arrive at the visitors' centre across the street from the Walls unit. Karen Sebung accompanies me as far as the waiting area, where we witnesses are searched, then Dona and Pam are escorted to another room by a female officer. When they return, a large man enters the room and introduces himself as an officer of the prison's internal affairs division. If we should feel faint, he says, medical attention is available. He also warns us that anyone who in any way attempts to disrupt the \"process,\" as he calls it, will be removed from the witness area immediately. Nothing about my body is working right. My feet and hands are cold and the side of my neck is numb.</p> <p>5.55pm. The corrections officer returns. \"Follow me, please.\" We walk across the street and through the front door of the old Gothic prison administration building. We turn left as soon as we enter and find ourselves in the waiting area of the governor's office, where we are asked to wait once again. There are two reporters there. The other three members of the press pool, along with the victims' family members, have already been escorted to the witness area, which is divided by a cinder-block wall. The two sets of witnesses will never come in contact with each other.</p> <p>6pm. We're led through a visiting area similar to the one at Ellis, then out into the bright evening sun for a moment and turn left down a short sidewalk. Another left and we enter a small brick building built into the side of the perimeter wall. We enter the tiny room in single file. Father Walsh appears from somewhere inside the death chamber to join us. The reporters enter last, and the door is locked behind us. I can hear the reporters scratching on their notepads with their pencils. There is only room for three of us - Dona, me, and Pam - in the front row. Dona grabs my left hand and squeezes it hard. She already has tears in her eyes.</p> <p>Jon is strapped to a hospital gurney with heavy leather restraints across his chest, hips, thighs, ankles, and wrists.</p> <p>His arms are wrapped in Ace bandages and extended at his sides on boards. At either wrist, clear plastic tubes protrude from the wrappings, snaking back under the gurney and disappearing through a plastic tube set in a bright blue cinder-block wall. I think I see movement behind the one-way glass mirror on the opposite wall - the executioner getting into position. Jon is smiling at us, his great neck twisted uncomfortably sideways. A microphone suspended from the ceiling hangs a few inches above his head. The speaker above our heads crackles to life and Jon speaks, craning his head around to see the victims' witnesses in the room next door.</p> <p>\"I know some of you won't believe me, but I am truly sorry for what I have done. I wish that I could undo what happened back then and bring back your loved ones, but I can't.\" Jon begins to sob as he addresses Mitzi Nalley's mother. \"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I wish I could bring her back to you. And Ron . . . I took so much from you. I'm sorry. I know you probably don't want my love, but you have it.\"</p> <p>Turning to me, he seems to regain his composure somewhat. He even manages to smile again. \"Steve, I can't believe that I had to go through all this to see you in a suit coat. Hey man, don't worry about the phone number, bro. You've done so much. I love you. Dona, thank you for being here. I know it was hard for you. I love you. Pam, thank you for coming from so far away. Thanks for all you have done. I love you. Bishop Carmody, thank you so much. Reverend Lopez and you, Father Walsh, I love you all. I have something I want to say. It comes from I Corinthians. It goes . . .\" and Jon recites the lengthy piece of scripture that he agonised over for weeks, afraid he would forget when the time came. He remembers every word.</p> <p>When he finishes reciting he takes a deep breath and says: \"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.\" The warden, recognising the prearranged signal he and Jon had agreed on, nods toward the unseen executioner and Jon begins to sing.</p> <p>\"Silent night / Holy night . . . \"</p> <p>He gets as far as \"mother and child\" and suddenly the air explodes from his lungs with a loud barking noise, deep and incongruous, like a child with whooping cough - \"HUH!!!\" His head pitches forward with such force that his heavy, prison-issue glasses fly off his face, bouncing from his chest and falling to the green tile floor below.</p> <p>And then he doesn't move at all. I watch his eyes fix and glaze over, my heart pounding in my chest and Dona squeezing my hand. Dead men look . . . well, dead. Vacant. No longer human. But there is a proto col to be satisfied. The warden checks his watch several times during the longest five minutes of my life. When the time is up, he walks across the room and knocks on the door. The doctor enters, his stethoscope earpieces already in place. He listens first at Jon's neck, then at his chest, then at his side. He shines a small flashlight into Jon's eyes for an instant and then, glancing up at the clock on his way out, intones: \"6.18.\"</p> <p>We are ushered out the same way we came, but I don't think any of us are the same people who crossed the street to the prison that day. I know I'm not. I can't help but wonder what happens to the people who work at the Walls, who see this horrific thing happen as often as four times a week. What do they see when they turn out the lights? I can't imagine.</p> <p>I do know that Jonathan Nobles changed profoundly while he was in prison. I know that the lives of people he came in contact with changed as well, including mine. America's criminal justice system isn't known for rehabilitation. I'm not sure that, as a society, we are even interested in that concept anymore. The problem is that most people who go to prison get out one day and walk among us. Given as many people as we lock up, we better learn to rehabilitate someone. I believe Jon might have been able to teach us how. Now we'll never know.</p> <p>\u0095 This article was first published in Tikkun magazine (subscriptions: 001 415 575 1200).</p>",

In the death chamber, we will be able to hear Jon over a speaker in the witness room, but this is our last opportunity to speak to him. Jon divides the remaining time between us more or less equally. I go first. Jon looks tired; the stress is showing for the first time. He leans down and motions me closer. I realise he's assessing my condition as well. \"You all right, man?\" I tell him that I'm OK. Jon is not convinced. \"I'm worried about you. You don't have to be Superman or nothin'. This is insane shit that's goin' on here today. You don't have to be strong for the women, if that's what you're thinkin'. They're big girls. You need to take care of yourself.\" \"I know, Jon. I'm all right. I went to a meeting last night and my manager's here now. I've also got a couple of friends up from Houston who have done this before.\" \"Witnessed?\" \"Yeah.\" That seemed to make him feel better. \"OK, but if you need to cry, it's all right. Go ahead and cry.\" \"When this is all over, I'll cry.\" \"Promise?\" \"I promise.\" Jon shifts gears suddenly. Back to business. He looks both ways to make sure the guard isn't watching. \"Take this.\" With much effort he pushes a tiny slip of tightly rolled paper, the diameter of a toothpick, through the impossibly tight mesh. Somehow he pulls it off. \"That's my daughter's phone number in California. My sister read it to me over the phone last night. They're going to strip search me and I can't take anything to the Walls and I'm afraid I'll forget it. Give it to Father Walsh. Then I'll have it when I make my last phone calls.\" I poke the paper in the watch pocket of my Levi's. There are a few other requests. He wants me to call his foster mother and his sister after the execution, and send flowers to two women who worked for the prison who were kind to him over the years. I promise that I won't forget. \"All right, bro. Take care of yourself and your kids. Tell Dona to come back.\" Hands against the glass one last time. \"I love you, Jonathan.\" \"I love you too, bro.\" Noon. I head back into Huntsville. My manager, Dan Gillis, arrived last night and not a moment too soon. Suddenly, driving has become difficult. The world has taken on a kind of surrealistic patina. I need someone to drive for the rest of the day. Also waiting at the hotel are two friends from the abolition movement, Karen Sebung and Ward Larkin. Both have witnessed executions, and they have made the trip to assist in any way they can. We talk over arrangements for the transportation and cremation of Jon's body, which, as it turns out, Dan has already taken care of. I make a couple of phone calls and check my messages. Then I shower, shave, and put on a pair of black jeans, a blue short-sleeve shirt, and a black linen sport coat. 4pm. We leave the hotel. Dan drives us to Hospitality House, a guest residence operated by the Baptist Church for the families of inmates. Dona and Pam, as well as Pam's friend Caroline, are staying there. The two other witnesses, Bishop Carmody of the East Texas diocese and the Reverend Richard Lopez of the Texas Department of Corrections are already there when we arrive. We are assembled here for an orientation session to be conducted by the Reverend Jim Brazzil, chaplain at the Walls unit. He and the warden will be the only two people inside the chamber with Jon when he dies. He goes through the execution process step-by-step so that we will know what to expect and, though it's obvious he speaks with authority, I'm not listening. I can't concentrate, so I just nod a lot. It doesn't matter. No matter how well or poorly the witnesses are prepared, they are going to kill Jon anyway. 5.05pm. Reverend Brazzil answers his cell phone. It's Father Walsh, who's over at the Walls with Jon and wants the phone number, the one that he passed me through the . . . oh my God. I can't find it. I was sure that I transferred the slip from my other jeans into my wallet when I changed clothes, but it's simply not there. Dan runs to the motel and checks my room, but it's hopeless. Reverend Brazzil relays the bad news to Father Walsh. I feel awful. 5.30pm. We arrive at the visitors' centre across the street from the Walls unit. Karen Sebung accompanies me as far as the waiting area, where we witnesses are searched, then Dona and Pam are escorted to another room by a female officer. When they return, a large man enters the room and introduces himself as an officer of the prison's internal affairs division. If we should feel faint, he says, medical attention is available. He also warns us that anyone who in any way attempts to disrupt the \"process,\" as he calls it, will be removed from the witness area immediately. Nothing about my body is working right. My feet and hands are cold and the side of my neck is numb. 5.55pm. The corrections officer returns. \"Follow me, please.\" We walk across the street and through the front door of the old Gothic prison administration building. We turn left as soon as we enter and find ourselves in the waiting area of the governor's office, where we are asked to wait once again. There are two reporters there. The other three members of the press pool, along with the victims' family members, have already been escorted to the witness area, which is divided by a cinder-block wall. The two sets of witnesses will never come in contact with each other. 6pm. We're led through a visiting area similar to the one at Ellis, then out into the bright evening sun for a moment and turn left down a short sidewalk. Another left and we enter a small brick building built into the side of the perimeter wall. We enter the tiny room in single file. Father Walsh appears from somewhere inside the death chamber to join us. The reporters enter last, and the door is locked behind us. I can hear the reporters scratching on their notepads with their pencils. There is only room for three of us - Dona, me, and Pam - in the front row. Dona grabs my left hand and squeezes it hard. She already has tears in her eyes. Jon is strapped to a hospital gurney with heavy leather restraints across his chest, hips, thighs, ankles, and wrists. His arms are wrapped in Ace bandages and extended at his sides on boards. At either wrist, clear plastic tubes protrude from the wrappings, snaking back under the gurney and disappearing through a plastic tube set in a bright blue cinder-block wall. I think I see movement behind the one-way glass mirror on the opposite wall - the executioner getting into position. Jon is smiling at us, his great neck twisted uncomfortably sideways. A microphone suspended from the ceiling hangs a few inches above his head. The speaker above our heads crackles to life and Jon speaks, craning his head around to see the victims' witnesses in the room next door. \"I know some of you won't believe me, but I am truly sorry for what I have done. I wish that I could undo what happened back then and bring back your loved ones, but I can't.\" Jon begins to sob as he addresses Mitzi Nalley's mother. \"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I wish I could bring her back to you. And Ron . . . I took so much from you. I'm sorry. I know you probably don't want my love, but you have it.\" Turning to me, he seems to regain his composure somewhat. He even manages to smile again. \"Steve, I can't believe that I had to go through all this to see you in a suit coat. Hey man, don't worry about the phone number, bro. You've done so much. I love you. Dona, thank you for being here. I know it was hard for you. I love you. Pam, thank you for coming from so far away. Thanks for all you have done. I love you. Bishop Carmody, thank you so much. Reverend Lopez and you, Father Walsh, I love you all. I have something I want to say. It comes from I Corinthians. It goes . . .\" and Jon recites the lengthy piece of scripture that he agonised over for weeks, afraid he would forget when the time came. He remembers every word. When he finishes reciting he takes a deep breath and says: \"Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.\" The warden, recognising the prearranged signal he and Jon had agreed on, nods toward the unseen executioner and Jon begins to sing. \"Silent night / Holy night . . . \" He gets as far as \"mother and child\" and suddenly the air explodes from his lungs with a loud barking noise, deep and incongruous, like a child with whooping cough - \"HUH!!!\" His head pitches forward with such force that his heavy, prison-issue glasses fly off his face, bouncing from his chest and falling to the green tile floor below. And then he doesn't move at all. I watch his eyes fix and glaze over, my heart pounding in my chest and Dona squeezing my hand. Dead men look . . . well, dead. Vacant. No longer human. But there is a proto col to be satisfied. The warden checks his watch several times during the longest five minutes of my life. When the time is up, he walks across the room and knocks on the door. The doctor enters, his stethoscope earpieces already in place. He listens first at Jon's neck, then at his chest, then at his side. He shines a small flashlight into Jon's eyes for an instant and then, glancing up at the clock on his way out, intones: \"6.18.\" We are ushered out the same way we came, but I don't think any of us are the same people who crossed the street to the prison that day. I know I'm not. I can't help but wonder what happens to the people who work at the Walls, who see this horrific thing happen as often as four times a week. What do they see when they turn out the lights? I can't imagine. I do know that Jonathan Nobles changed profoundly while he was in prison. I know that the lives of people he came in contact with changed as well, including mine. America's criminal justice system isn't known for rehabilitation. I'm not sure that, as a society, we are even interested in that concept anymore. The problem is that most people who go to prison get out one day and walk among us. Given as many people as we lock up, we better learn to rehabilitate someone. I believe Jon might have been able to teach us how. Now we'll never know. \u0095 This article was first published in Tikkun magazine (subscriptions: 001 415 575 1200).",

      "bodyText": "A Jewish settler who clubbed a Palestinian child to death with a rifle butt was sentenced to six months' community service yesterday in a decision denounced as an outrage by human rights organisations. The Jerusalem district court said it decided not to jail Nachum Korman for the killing of 11-year-old Hilmi Shusha four years ago because he had only been convicted of manslaughter by negligence, and had served eight months in prison. It fined him 70,000 shekels (about \u00a311,600). The sentence handed down by the Jerusalem district court yesterday is especially suspect because it was determined by the same judge, Ruth Or, who acquitted Korman at his original trial after rejecting evidence from witnesses and the state pathologist. That verdict was overturned by the supreme court, which convicted him of manslaughter and sent him back to the district court for sentencing. Korman, the chief of security at the Hadar Beitar settlement, descended on the Shushas' West Bank village in October 1996 to hunt down a group of children who had been pelting Jewish cars with stones. Cousins of the dead boy, who saw the assault, said he pinned Hilmi down with his foot before delivering the fatal blow. Korman claimed he never intended to kill the child, and said he tried to revive him. The boy's father, Said Shusha, told Israel radio the sentence amounted to \"giving people a licence to kill\". The B'Tselem human rights organisation said the sentence was part of a pattern of institutions turning a blind eye to abuses of Palestinians by Israelis while showing no mercy to Arabs accused of causing injury to Jews. It said such leniency prevailed long before the intifada, and mobs of Jewish settlers have often been accused of attacking Palestinian villagers in the West Bank. \"At a time when violence by Israeli civilians against Palestinians is increasing, the court's decision sends the message that Palestinian life is cheap, and that Israeli civilians in the occupied territories can continue to abuse Palestinians with impunity,\" B'Tselem said in a statement. The decision is bound to deepen criticism of systematic racial prejudice in Israel's law enforcement system. Also yesterday, the governing body of Israel's 1m Palestinian citizens submitted an investigative report to the supreme court, accusing the government of sanctioning a shoot-to-kill policy against Arab protesters inside Israel in October, when 13 demonstrators were shot dead. Meanwhile, the supreme court is considering the release of another Jewish settler, Yoram Skolnik, who was convicted in 1993 of shooting dead a Palestinian who lay on the ground with his hands and legs bound. Israel's former president, Ezer Weizman, granted Skolnik two reductions on his life term, and the parole board has recommended his early release for good behaviour. Meanwhile, Israeli troops shot dead a 15-year-old Palestinian stonethrower in the Gaza Strip yesterday, hours before the start of talks in the Egyptian resort of Taba.

It also appears to have persuaded a Japanese company to do the same. Kr85, a byproduct of nuclear fission, is being vented through chimneys when spent fuel is reprocessed at the Thorp plant in Cumbria.

Each October since, the company has reported failure, and it has now asked the environment agency for leave merely to review other people's research. The company also appears to have succeeded in preventing a competitor from fitting equipment to capture Kr85 to a plant being built in Japan. A 1996 memorandum from Rupert Wilcox-Baker, senior public relations adviser to BNFL, has been passed to the Guardian because BNFL has this year applied officially to the environment agency to be allowed to continue its policy of \"dilute and disperse\", which means allowing the gas to escape through tall chimneys over the north of England. Dated March 22 1996, Mr Wilcox-Baker's memorandum to Matthew Simmonds, senior manager at Thorp, says: \"What we sell or give Japanese Nuclear Fuels Ltd on Kr85 is a commercial decision.

      "bodyText": "The 2001 Teaching Awards are launched today, with a plea for nominations from as wide a range of schools as possible. The awards year begins with National Nominate a Teacher Day. Parents, pupils and teachers are urged to nominate staff who make a distinctive contribution in the classroom. Lord Puttnam, chairman of trustees for the awards - dubbed the Platos - said the event, in its third year, had become an accepted part of the education calendar. \"The penny has dropped,\" he said. While there had been \"initial nervousness\" about the awards, \"it was always related to the mythology of divisiveness. \"We are using the mantle of the awards to raise the profile of teaching as a whole.\" Nominees will attend regional awards ceremonies. A national televised ceremony will take place later in the year. The day will be launched by James Nesbitt, star of the TV comedy drama Cold Feet. \"Having teachers as parents, I've seen the time, effort and pride that goes into the profession,\" he said. The awards are being supported again by the Guardian. BT is the main sponsor. Ted Wragg, professor of education at Exeter University, is chairman of the judging panel. The categories are: primary teacher of the year; secondary teacher of the year; learning support assistant of the year; school leadership in a primary school; school leadership in a secondary school; working with parents and the community; most creative use of information and communication technology; excellence in special needs teaching; outstanding new teacher; and lifetime achievement. A nomination coupon will be carried in the Guardian. Nominations can also be made by accessing www.teachingawards.com",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair sent two of his most senior officials on an unannounced official visit to the United States last week in an effort to place his Labour government at the centre of US-European relations under President George Bush's new Republican administration. Mr Blair is determined to prove to domestic and international opinion that he can be as close to the Republican President Bush as he was to the former Democratic president Bill Clinton. As a result, even while Mr Clinton remained in office, Downing Street quietly breached protocol last week by holding two days of top-level meetings with the Bush team in an effort to ensure that the new relationship remains as special as the old one. Normally, such negotiations would not take place until the new administration has taken office, but Mr Blair is so determined to stake his claim with Mr Bush that he sent his chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, and his foreign affairs adviser, John Sawers, to Washington last week to jump the queue. The prime minister is pitching hard to be the first European leader to travel to Washington for talks with the new US leader. Officials are hoping that he will make his next Washington visit in February or March, weeks before Mr Blair is expected to call a general election, widely predicted to be pencilled in for May 3. If Mr Bush agrees to the visit, which British officials hope will be confirmed as soon as this week, he will hand Mr Blair a double prize. Mr Blair would not only be the first European leader to win an invitation to the Bush White House, but he would also frustrate the opposition leader William Hague's claims to be the man with the new president's ear. During his visit on January 15 and 16 Mr Powell had talks with Andrew Card, the new White House chief of staff, and other Bush officials, while Mr Sawers met General Colin Powell, the new US secretary of state, and had a two-hour discussion with Mr Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice. The British officials did not meet Mr Bush, who was in Texas. British officials said yesterday that while the visit was not a secret, they had not drawn attention to it. Britain did not want to offend other European governments, a source said. The ostensible main purpose of the Blair visit would be to ensure that the two leaders, who have never met, would be able to get to know one another and to build a relationship similar to that between Mr Blair and Mr Clinton. British diplomatic officials said yesterday that the two leaders are politically compatible centrists who will find it easy to achieve a personal rapport. Politically, the main issues on the agenda include defence, notably US missile defence plans and the European defence initiative, as well as Bosnia, Kosovo and Iraq and trade issues. Mr Blair spoke to Mr Clinton about Northern Ireland as recently as last week.

The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, will be the first senior British minister to visit Washington since the change of administration when he meets General Powell at the state department next month. In Washington yesterday Mr Card confirmed that Mr Bush's first foreign trip as president is likely to be to Mexico. He will also travel to Quebec for a summit of north and south American leaders in April. Mr Bush's first scheduled visit to Europe is in June when he attends the EU-US summit in Gothenberg.

      "bodyText": "A former French foreign minister and intimate of the late president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand appears in the dock today as a Paris court begins long-awaited hearings into France's biggest postwar sleaze scandal. Roland Dumas, who resigned last year as France's highest legal authority, is charged, along with his former mistress Christine Deviers-Joncour; the one-time boss of the oil giant Elf-Aquitaine, Loik le Floch Prigent and four others, with complicity in the misuse of Elf funds. Alfred Sirven, a former director of Elf Aquitaine International and allegedly Mr Le Floch Prigent's chief fixer and bagman, is believed to be in hiding in the Philippines and will be tried in his absence. Like the others, he risks a \u00a3250,000 fine and up to five years in prison. The trial of Mr Dumas, which coincides with an investigation into illicit Mitterrand-era arms-trafficking in Africa allegedly involving the late president's son, will throw a cruel new light on the shadowy, semi-legal dealings and institutionalised corruption that flourished under France's first Socialist president. Intrigue Dubbed by one newspaper \"the prince of intrigue in Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's palace\", Mr Dumas - the highest-ranking figure to be tried for such offences in France - is accused of benefiting from the staggering \u00a3250m Elf spent in the early 1990s on furthering its own interests and those of the late president at home and abroad. The trial, which is expected to last four weeks, will revolve around the sums paid by Elf to Ms Deviers-Joncour in expenses, salary and commissions - an alleged total of \u00a36.45m - between 1989 and 1993, in exchange for what the prosecution claims was a non-existent job. Mr Dumas, 78, is accused of using his position as foreign minister to ensure his mistress was hired by Elf, and subsequently, of profiting from the money the company gave her to lobby him over the controversial sale of six frigates to Taiwan by another state-controlled firm, Thompson, in 1991. Elf allegedly promised Thompson, in exchange for a share of the profits, to use its influence as an unofficial arm of government to help push through the sale, which was opposed by China and, to begin with, by Mr Dumas himself - before he inexplicably changed his mind. The affaire des fregates is currently the focus of an altogether separate investigation, one of six probes under way into the many-tentacled Elf scandal that have so far seen more than 20 people placed under formal investigation. Among the cast of characters accused or suspected of benefiting from Elf's largesse in varying aspects of the case are Mitterand's golf partner and doctor Laurent Raillard, the former Gaullist interior minister Charles Pasqua, Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, the author of Bonjour Tristesse, and up to a dozen former Elf employees. To help her in her lobbying, Elf allegedly furnished Ms Deviers-Joncour with a company credit line of \u00a320,000 a month and \u00a31.7m flat on the exclusive Left Bank rue de Lille, which witnesses say Mr Dumas routinely used for lavish parties. According to the investigating magistrates, Eva Joly and Laurence Vichnievsky, she bought her lover Mr Dumas extravagant gifts with Elf's cash, including a pair of bespoke Italian shoes costing \u00a31,110 and five antique statues for \u00a326,400. Mr Dumas has been unable to explain the millions of francs that appeared on his bank balance during the early 1990s, but he has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, insisting that he was unaware where the money or gifts came from - a claim investigators argue simply cannot be true. \"It is easier to crush me than to investigate the role of France itself, which benefited greatly from this subtle game of shadows and light, which I inherited but did not start or gain from,\" Mr Dumas said in one interview. Three main players in the Elf corruption saga Roland Dumas Now 78, Mr Dumas was twice foreign minister and, until 1999, president of the constitutional council, the highest legal body in the land. He was one of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's oldest, most loyal companions; theirs was a friendship that began in the early postwar years. Silver-haired, dapper, brilliant, charming and cultured, as a lawyer he was for 20 years one of the stars of the Paris bar, representing the likes of Matisse and Giacometti. He was also the executor of Picasso's will, and played a prominent role in returning the painter's masterpiece, Guernica, to Spain. His main defence is that he is being used to bury all that remains of Mitterrandism. Christine Deviers-Joncour The former mistress of Roland Dumas is alleged to have been paid more than \u00a36m to lobby her lover on behalf of Elf. The former lingerie model is now a regular figure on television talkshows and has published three books telling her side of the story, one unambiguously entitled The Whore of the Republic. An elegant twice-married 53-year-old, Ms Deviers-Joncour's principal means of defence in her often confused testimony has been to counter-attack, claiming that she is now a reformed character engaged in a bitter fight against political corruption and the Gallic penchant for high-level cover-ups. Loik Le Floch Prigent The president of Elf Aquitaine from 1989 to 1993, former head of the then state-owned chemicals company R\u00f4hne-Poulenc and subsequently, the head of SNCF, the French railways company, was once a civil service high-flyer who has persistently denied doing anything more than acting in accordance with an agreement worked out with Mitterrand. He claims that the president knew of and tolerated such deals. \"I'm being made a scapegoat,\" he said. Nonetheless, he will be asked to explain how he came to charge his company credit card for \u00a36,800 worth of CDs in a single afternoon.",

Mrs Arroyo has made no firm promises regarding her predecessor except to say that: \"There cannot be reconciliation without justice.\" The national ombudsman and several civil society groups have already said that they will file charges against Mr Estrada, who allegedly took payoffs from illegal gambling syndicates, tobacco taxes and numerous business deals. In a sign that she means to root out the executive-level corruption that blighted the Philippines during Mr Estrada's tenure in power, Mrs Arroyo's first executive order as president was to ban any of her immediate relatives from having business links with the bureaucracy.

He never achieved the commercial success that many had predicted for him, despite career breaks back in the 1970s, but he retained a strong following that included many fellow musicians.</p> <p>Last October, alongside guitarist John Renbourn at London's South Bank, Guillory once again demonstrated the highly original approach that typified his playing. He was influenced by anything from Irish music to the classic rock and jazz performers of his era, from Bob Dylan to Weather Report. In an interview in 1999, he quoted Duke Ellington's famous saying, \"there are two types of music, good and bad\", adding, \"I have been influenced by everything in category one.\"</p> <p>For three decades, Guillory played a varied, colourful role on the British music scene, but he had already enjoyed success with American bands before he moved here. He was born on the US naval base at Guantanamo, Cuba, where his father worked until the Castro revolution of 1959. There, he started studying music and was taught to play the guitar by his mother. When he was 11, his family moved to Florida, where Guillory divided his time between surfing and musical studies.</p> <p>As a teenager, he joined a leading Florida band, the Illusions, as lead guitarist. But the family moved again, this time to Chicago, where Isaac taught and continued to study the guitar, Moog synthesiser, theory and composition at Roosevelt University. Inevitably, he began working with more local bands, including the nationally-known \"psychedelic bubblegum\" band Cryin' Shames, for whom he played bass and recorded two albums for CBS.</p> <p>He quit in 1970, and decided to \"do Europe\", wandering off with his guitar on a journey that started in Morocco and continued through Spain and Holland. Here he met the British singer-songwriter Al Stewart, who brought Guillory to Britain, and asked him to accompany him at the 1971 Cambridge folk festival, where Stewart was headlining. When it came to the encore, said Guillory, \"Stewart walked up to the mike, introduced me, and walked off, saying 'Have fun.' Not many people would do that.\"</p> <p>That solo performance, and this public endorsement from the then highly-fashionable Stewart, came at just the right time. It was one of British pop's great freewheeling eras, when singer-songwriters and guitar players were equally welcome on the folk circuit and the underground rock circuit, and promoter Jeff Dexter invited Guillory to play at the Roundhouse, in Chalk Farm, then the home of London's progressive music scene. He appeared on a bill that included Kevin Ayers and Renaissance, and impressed Dexter as a performer who \"sounded like a new James Taylor, but could play guitar like nobody else\".</p> <p>Thanks to Dexter, now his co-manager, along with his friend Ian Samwell, Guillory embarked on a solo career and signed to Atlantic Records. He combined guitar skill and good looks but, though his 1973 album, Isaac Guillory, was well received by the music press, it failed to sell well enough to impress Atlantic. A second album for the company was never released, and only recently have some of the songs from this set become available on the compilation, The Atlantic Years.</p> <p>Despite this setback, Guillory stayed on in Britain, where he married Tina Thompson. He toured and recorded with Elkie Brooks, made an album with Donovan, and recorded two albums with the jazz fusion band Pacific Eardrum. Later, he worked with Barbara Dickson, accompanied Joan Baez, and - in yet another change of direction - worked as session guitarist for producer Trevor Horn, playing guitar on the Buggles' hit, Video Killed The Radio Star.</p> <p>Guillory was a musician who knew his craft, and had long experience in both studying and teaching music. While working with Barbara Dickson, he co-wrote The Guitar Handbook, with Ralph Denyer, which became a basis for the BBC-TV series Rock School. He also regularly lectured at the Guildhall School of Music.</p> <p>Throughout his career, Guillory switched between solo work and a love of playing in bands. In recent years, his solo career had once again appeared to be on the rise, with the revival of interest in acoustic guitar heroes. He was building yet another new following through folk clubs, and the release of his self-produced and self-marketed albums.</p> <p>He was now re-married, to Victoria McMillan, and living in Wallsend, near Newcastle. He had four children - the actress Sienna Guillory and Jace (from his first marriage), and Ellie and Jacob.</p> <p>\u0095 Isaac Guillory, musician and teacher, born February 27 1947; died December 31 2000</p>",

The expected resignation today of Fukushiro Nukaga, who had been tipped as a future prime minister, would be a huge blow to the ruling Liberal Democratic party ahead of an upper house election in July. Last month Mr Nukaga was appointed minister in charge of economic and fiscal policy in a reshuffle designed to lift the government's dismal ratings and oversee the biggest reform of Japan's administrative structure in more than a century. But the scandal in which he is implicated has served only to underline the unchanging nature of the money-driven ties between politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen. Mr Nukaga has admitted that his secretary received 15m yen (\u00a385,000) from KSD, an insurer for small businesses, between 1999 and 2000, while he was deputy chief cabinet secretary. The opposition claims that he was paid to in sert references to KSD's plans for a new technical university in prime ministerial speeches. Mr Nukaga has proclaimed his innocence, saying he returned the money as soon as he found out about it six months later, but senior LDP members spent the weekend urging him to stand down. \"There is a big gap between the logic among politicians and that of the general public, and the situation surrounding him is serious,\" the party's secretary general, Makoto Koga, said on television yesterday.

But, says Sheila Coronel of the Philippine Centre for Investigative Journalism: \"It's her husband [Mike Arroyo] that most people are worried about. He does have a reputation as being a businessman with shady contacts.\" Mrs Arroyo has learned much from her father, Diosdado Macapagal, who was president from 1961-65. The Philippines' only other female president, Corazon Aquino, made her a trade minister in 1986 and there followed a period in the senate. Then, in 1998, she became vice-president with more votes than Mr Estrada polled for the presidency.",

Now an internal cabinet office memo about the supposed connections and quirks of a hotch-potch of political journalists, leaked to the Guardian, has cast a new light on the thoroughness with which this enterprise is prosecuted - and highlighted the increasingly incestuous, inward-looking process of modern politics, as politicians report on journalists reporting on politicians.

This cabinet office briefing on print journalists (see box) is understood to have been drafted in the autumn by Carl Shoben with Chris McShane, the two special advisers who effectively guide the government's media monitoring unit on Campbell's behalf and previously did the same job at Millbank. Not to be confused with the more proactive strategic communications unit at Number 10, the media monitoring unit works on the Millbank model, providing round-the-clock summaries and analysis of the press and broadcast media to ministers and civil servants across Whitehall, including Blair himself.

      "body": "<p>Tony Adams's decision to end his England career now rather than later is a case of a message being received and understood. In other words he has responded logically to what his body has been telling him for some time. </p> <p>Adams would never have given up international football because he feared being dropped or merely because the new England coach, Sven-Goran Eriksson, has intimated in a vague sort of way that David Beckham might keep the captaincy. Recurring injuries, in particular a back problem, have persuaded Adams that, at 34 and in order to prolong his career with his club, Arsenal, he must give up playing for his country. Eriksson said he was \"sorry\" to hear of Adam's international retirement, having long admired his leadership qualities, but that he respected his decision. </p> <p>In some ways his departure was inevitable. Last summer he led Kevin Keegan's team into the 2000 European Championship reading Henry V and ready to shore up English pride with English dead. But injuries restricted his participation to the opening game against Portugal. </p> <p>Back to the squad he came for the start of the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, only to be forced out by injury for the Finland game four days after England's defeat by Germany at Wembley had hastened Keegan's departure and, with the help of Lazio's slump, Eriksson's arrival. Perhaps Adams should have been studying Hamlet - where practically everyone of note ends up dead except Fortinbras. </p> <p>Eriksson would have been Adams's sixth England coach. Bobby Robson gave him his first cap in a friendly against Spain in Madrid in 1987, a match England won 4-2, and the following summer he played in the 1988 European Championship in West Germany, when Robson's side lost all three group games and came home early. </p> <p>Adams missed the 1990 World Cup, although right up to the squad deadline he was waiting on reports of Mark Wright's fitness. Two years later, when Wright pulled out of Graham Taylor's squad for the 1992 European Championship after the deadline, England failed to get Uefa's permission to bring in Adams and he had to wait until Euro 96 to lead his country in a major tournament. </p> <p>This Adams did with distinction, finally dispelling the image of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1988 when Marco van Basten turned him inside out in scoring the first of his three goals in Holland's 3-1 victory. In 1996 England avenged themselves on the Dutch with an exhilarating 4-1 win but in the quarter-finals they struggled against Spain and owed much to Adams in taking the game to penalties, where David Seaman took over. </p> <p>In the 1998 World Cup Adams again provided the leadership qualities England needed and surpassed himself in St Etienne when, following the dismissal of Beckham, Hoddle's 10 men forced Argentina to extra-time and, fatefully as it turned out this time, penalties. </p> <p>As far as the England captaincy goes Adams will be a bigger loss than Alan Shearer, who retired from internationals after Euro 2000. The strength of Adams was that, whether or not he was wearing the captain's armband, he effectively led the team when the going became difficult. International football coaches rarely see captaincy in the same light as their equivalents in cricket or rugby. </p> <p>It would be surprising if Eriksson regards the question of who will lead his England teams as a matter of high priority and Beckham may well get the armband simply because he had it when the Swede took over. </p> <p>The strongest alternative to Beckham as England captain is Tottenham's Sol Campbell. But Eriksson will be more concerned with getting the blend of experience and youth he needs after the team's stumbling start to the World Cup qualifiers, with youngsters like Liverpool's Steven Gerrard and Manchester United's Wes Brown high on his list. </p> <p>With England in a state of transition but still needing to take at least seven points from World Cup matches against Finland, Albania and Greece if they are to retain a chance of reaching next year's tournament in Japan and South Korea, it is a pity that Adams has felt it necessary to stand down now. His experience would have been invaluable in helping the newer caps settle in. </p> <p>Yet Adams clearly feels he still has something to give Arsenal and, had he continued his international career he might have ended up having to retire altogether. As it is, the example Adams has set in fighting alcoholism to lead his country with such distinction says everything about the strength of character England have now lost and will be fortunate to find elsewhere. </p> <p>Just one thought: when Adams goes, can Seaman be far behind? </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Tony Adams's decision to end his England career now rather than later is a case of a message being received and understood. In other words he has responded logically to what his body has been telling him for some time. Adams would never have given up international football because he feared being dropped or merely because the new England coach, Sven-Goran Eriksson, has intimated in a vague sort of way that David Beckham might keep the captaincy. Recurring injuries, in particular a back problem, have persuaded Adams that, at 34 and in order to prolong his career with his club, Arsenal, he must give up playing for his country. Eriksson said he was \"sorry\" to hear of Adam's international retirement, having long admired his leadership qualities, but that he respected his decision. In some ways his departure was inevitable. Last summer he led Kevin Keegan's team into the 2000 European Championship reading Henry V and ready to shore up English pride with English dead. But injuries restricted his participation to the opening game against Portugal. Back to the squad he came for the start of the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, only to be forced out by injury for the Finland game four days after England's defeat by Germany at Wembley had hastened Keegan's departure and, with the help of Lazio's slump, Eriksson's arrival. Perhaps Adams should have been studying Hamlet - where practically everyone of note ends up dead except Fortinbras. Eriksson would have been Adams's sixth England coach. Bobby Robson gave him his first cap in a friendly against Spain in Madrid in 1987, a match England won 4-2, and the following summer he played in the 1988 European Championship in West Germany, when Robson's side lost all three group games and came home early. Adams missed the 1990 World Cup, although right up to the squad deadline he was waiting on reports of Mark Wright's fitness. Two years later, when Wright pulled out of Graham Taylor's squad for the 1992 European Championship after the deadline, England failed to get Uefa's permission to bring in Adams and he had to wait until Euro 96 to lead his country in a major tournament. This Adams did with distinction, finally dispelling the image of D\u00fcsseldorf in 1988 when Marco van Basten turned him inside out in scoring the first of his three goals in Holland's 3-1 victory. In 1996 England avenged themselves on the Dutch with an exhilarating 4-1 win but in the quarter-finals they struggled against Spain and owed much to Adams in taking the game to penalties, where David Seaman took over. In the 1998 World Cup Adams again provided the leadership qualities England needed and surpassed himself in St Etienne when, following the dismissal of Beckham, Hoddle's 10 men forced Argentina to extra-time and, fatefully as it turned out this time, penalties. As far as the England captaincy goes Adams will be a bigger loss than Alan Shearer, who retired from internationals after Euro 2000. The strength of Adams was that, whether or not he was wearing the captain's armband, he effectively led the team when the going became difficult. International football coaches rarely see captaincy in the same light as their equivalents in cricket or rugby. It would be surprising if Eriksson regards the question of who will lead his England teams as a matter of high priority and Beckham may well get the armband simply because he had it when the Swede took over. The strongest alternative to Beckham as England captain is Tottenham's Sol Campbell. But Eriksson will be more concerned with getting the blend of experience and youth he needs after the team's stumbling start to the World Cup qualifiers, with youngsters like Liverpool's Steven Gerrard and Manchester United's Wes Brown high on his list. With England in a state of transition but still needing to take at least seven points from World Cup matches against Finland, Albania and Greece if they are to retain a chance of reaching next year's tournament in Japan and South Korea, it is a pity that Adams has felt it necessary to stand down now. His experience would have been invaluable in helping the newer caps settle in. Yet Adams clearly feels he still has something to give Arsenal and, had he continued his international career he might have ended up having to retire altogether. As it is, the example Adams has set in fighting alcoholism to lead his country with such distinction says everything about the strength of character England have now lost and will be fortunate to find elsewhere. Just one thought: when Adams goes, can Seaman be far behind? \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Laudably, the programmers have chosen to celebrate mostly web-specific work, injecting hefty doses of animation (including the wonderful Fishbar) and documentaries like Jennifer Arnold's The Mullet Chronicles, for a diverse mix. Dodging the grant-aided film art for once, we hit on stylish and stylised animation Romanov: Scarf Mania, which unfolds silent-film-style, with elegant off-beat intertitles, and found out what happens to the muffler-free in a city where bare necks are considered an erotic spectacle. Which whetted our appetite for Chris Lanier's weekly Romanov webcartoons on <a href=\"http://www.wildbrain.com\">www.wildbrain.com</a>. But will it stand a chance in the Sundance Online Audience Award stakes, we wonder? \"Vote early, vote often,\" as they say in Dade County, Florida.

      "bodyText": "Romanov: Scarf Mania (www.sundanceonlinefilmfestival.org) Webfilm finally gets the Sundance imprimatur this week, with the world's favourite indie festival debuting an online festival alongside the Park City shenanigans. Laudably, the programmers have chosen to celebrate mostly web-specific work, injecting hefty doses of animation (including the wonderful Fishbar) and documentaries like Jennifer Arnold's The Mullet Chronicles, for a diverse mix. Dodging the grant-aided film art for once, we hit on stylish and stylised animation Romanov: Scarf Mania, which unfolds silent-film-style, with elegant off-beat intertitles, and found out what happens to the muffler-free in a city where bare necks are considered an erotic spectacle. Which whetted our appetite for Chris Lanier's weekly Romanov webcartoons on www.wildbrain.com. But will it stand a chance in the Sundance Online Audience Award stakes, we wonder? \"Vote early, vote often,\" as they say in Dade County, Florida. (KS) \u0095 View the film Script Doctor (www.atomfilms.com) Nurse 1: \"Pagecount is rising, doctor\" Nurse 2: \"We're losing the adolescent audience\" Doctor: \"I'm going to flashbacks - CLEAR!\" Of course it's a one-trick pony, but Adam Field's ER-inflected take on script doctoring manages to pad out the gag nicely with a stream of anxious screenwriters whose problems are diagnosed as everything from infertile writing partnerships (\"Your ideas are sterile - have you considered adapting?\") to a bad case of clich\u00e9.

And Bryony Lavery's lyrical and tender new play, jointly presented by Sphinx Theatre Company and Birmingham Rep, tackles it on multiple levels - literally in that it deals with a mother afflicted by Alzheimer's, and metaphorically in that it suggests that our whole life is a fusion of past and present and is shaped by the virtual reality of cinema. </p> <p>Set in a fog-enveloped wedding marquee, Lavery's 90-minute play presents parallel but intertwined actions. In part, it is the story of free-spirited lesbian Sally who meets the amazing Grace at a wedding and who, after an ecstatic fling, finds herself torn between independent solitude and lifelong commitment. But it is equally about the devastating impact of Alzheimer's on Sally's mother, Evelyn, and on her father, vainly trying to cope with a wife who scarcely recognises him. To add to a rich brew, Sally's brother is a California-based movie buff and the action is suffused with memories of Evelyn's favourite film, Casablanca. </p> <p>What strikes one most of all is Lavery's compassionate understanding of life's erratic mixture of farce and sadness. There's a great scene where the whole family pursues the runaway Evelyn, who has just wet herself, in order to dress her in a nappy and the blue dress that symbolises her youth. Without moralising, Lavery shows the awful absurdity of life and the way age reduces us to childlike dependency. She also suggests that the tragedy of Alzheimer's is its unpredictability. One moment Evelyn treats her husband as an intrusive stranger, the next she seems to be reliving some past dinner party forever fixed in her memory. </p> <p>If I have any reservation, it is that Lavery never fully establishes the causal connection between Sally's filial caring and final commitment to Grace; it seems to hinge on the idea that love has to be given \"unconditionally\" - but a word is a slender thread on which to hang a total change of heart. One's doubts, however, are overcome by the limpid beauty of Annie Castledine's production and Ruari Murchison's wedding-tent design - and by the quality of the acting. Jackie Clune's impish mischief as Sally is offset by the fixed intensity of Aicha Kossoko as Grace. Kika Markham's remarkable Evelyn, oscillating between vacant serenity and fury, is balanced by Andrew Hawkins's impotent concern as her husband. Even the evocation of Casablanca adds to the play's pervasive mood-music and sense of life's comic sadness. </p> <p>\u0095 Until February 3. Box office: 020-7478 0100.</p>",

This study may provide the reasons why.\" </p> <p>Least surprising to support staff will be the result that almost half work more than 40 hours a week. \"The average UK employee works seven hours a week for nothing,\" confirms another new survey by the TUC.

Secretaries disagree. Eleven per cent say they find their role less fulfilling,\" it reports. This, found Tomazou, is generally down to lack of recognition, increased responsibility and the stress of constant change - whether it's constituted by new technology or a company takeover. </p> <p>Likewise, support staff are revealed to be far less enthusiastic about the level of training and development they get than their employ ers. \"I get sent on an annual two-day course to update my IT skills. Yet my employers consider themselves 'committed to the development of our staff'. It's a joke,\" laments Kate, a PA at a small City firm. Kate doubts her manager even knows she's a graduate, a claim that the study also shows is not uncommon, with employers estimating that a quarter of their secretaries hold a degree whereas the actual figure is closer to half. </p> <p>\"It is reasonable to assume that the higher qualified and trained the secretary, the more likelihood of a salary rise or promotion,\" says careers adviser Jane Scott. \"So it is reasonable to assume from this report that secretaries are missing out on deserved rewards. Coupled with the resentment and frustration they must feel as a result of being overlooked in other areas, I'm not a bit surprised companies are experiencing a higher turnover rate of support staff than ever.\" </p> <p>Carmel Steiner, divisional director for recruitment consultancy Angela Mortimer, has found that disparity between the views of bosses and their secretaries is most likely to occur in companies where \"secretary\" is still perceived in the traditional sense. \"Some sectors - particularly those dominated by 'old-school' men - still consider secretaries in that old-fash ioned letter-taking kind of way. In other words, that they don't do much else,\" she explains. </p> <p>Paul Jacobs, communications director at recruitment agency Office Angels, believes one solution lies is changing the term \"secretary\". \"Fifty per cent of today's secretaries manage their own projects and 71% have sole control for budgets averaging \u00a330,000,\" he says. \"This massive increase in responsibility is the very reason that we now call top secretaries 'executaries'. It's a term that reflects this increase and encourages bosses to recognise it.\" </p> <p>Indeed, one recent survey from Office Angels found that whether people are called secretaries or executaries, the roles are very often identical. The difference is that the latter are more likely to have bosses who appreciate their worth. </p> <p>Steiner agrees that recruitment agencies have a role to play in educating bosses. \"We make a point of visiting them to explain that they'll have to change old-fashioned mentalities if they want to keep good staff,\" she says. </p> <p>But secretaries seeking recognition must also help themselves, insists Jacobs. \"If there's an appraisal system in place, it's worth taking advantage of the annual review to make your boss aware of your main areas of responsibility and achievements over the previous year, requesting training, promotion and a salary increase where appropriate. It's a good idea to find out what you're worth in the marketplace by looking at advertisements for similar positions so that you can provide evidence of what you could be earning. It's also a good idea to be able to justify the reasons you want training or promotion, spelling out the added value you feel you'll be able to give your boss and company.\" </p> <p>If there isn't an appraisal system in place, call a meeting anyway, advises Jacobs. \" Bosses rarely just wake up one morning and think, 'Wow, my secretary really does work hard and I'm going to reward that.'

He also fathered at least 25 operas, but popular histories hardly ever mention them - as though they were wild oats, best not discussed in polite company. Received opinion rarely goes further than remarking that Haydn wasn't as good an opera composer as his younger contemporary Mozart. But that's rather like saying that someone isn't as good a poet as Shakespeare. </p> <p>Haydn's last opera, Orfeo ed Eurydice, or L'anima del filosofo (the spirit of philosophy) had a rare outing in a concert performance with the Academy of Ancient Music, conducted by Christopher Hogwood, on Saturday - the only UK stop on its current European tour. Received opinion survived the trial - but only just. </p> <p>On the evidence of this performance, Haydn certainly had his limitations as an opera composer. Pace flags; the libretto rambles. And yet Orfeo is full of sharply memorable things - vivid choral writing and at least one great aria - the Sibyl's brilliant Al tuo seno fortunato in act three. No less astonishing is the ending. It isn't simply that Haydn defies convention and ends the opera quietly: the Bacchantes' chilling cries of terror simply evaporate into a low drum-roll and a few muted gasps of D minor. Even Mozart would have been proud of that. </p> <p>Christopher Hogwood's enthusiasm for Haydn was obvious. In places where the pace might have sagged fatally, Hogwood kept up the momentum. The playing of the Academy of Ancient Music was alert, clear, muscular and supple. An advantage of period instruments is that the players don't have to rein themselves in: 18th-century trumpets, trombones and drums can blare and pound to their hearts' delight without fear of swamping the voices. </p> <p>The voices were well worth hearing. Albert Schagidullin created a noble, impassioned human being out of Euridice's father, King Creonte - his aria of vengeance, Alla vendetta!, with its surging strings and scintillating brass fanfares, made a thrilling finale for act two. As Orfeo, Raul Giminez was elegant and sweet-toned. But the star of the evening was - as it had to be - Cecilia Bartoli in the dual role as Euridice and the Sybil. In itself, Bartoli's voice isn't especially powerful: it was her agility, searing expression and strikingly natural musicality that made this a great performance. The rapturous applause at the end of Al tuo seno fortunato was thoroughly deserved.</p>",
