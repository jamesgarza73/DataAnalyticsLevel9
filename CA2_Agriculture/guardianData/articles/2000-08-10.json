      "body": "<p> There could not possibly be a more terrible film on release now than Rules of Engagement, the big new action movie from no less a director than William Friedkin. This shrill, belligerent, reactionary nonsense is lazily plotted, grotesquely dishonest, and dripping with a creepy strain of Islamophobia. The film is about one of Uncle Sam's uniformed heroes accused of bending the rules in the heat of battle and - but of course - let down by the pointy-headed PC politicos in Washington. Samuel L Jackson plays Colonel Terry Childers, a Marine Corps veteran who leads a mission to rescue the US ambassador from the Yemen embassy. The ambassador is a nervous, cowardly, duplicitous liar, and therefore played by a British actor, Ben Kingsley. When a local anti-American demo turns ugly a catastrophe ensues. </p> <p>Shot at from somewhere outside the embassy compound, Childers orders his men to fire into the crowd - having to repeat his order to a terrified subordinate who can see no justification for this - and causes scores of civilian deaths. </p> <p>The consequent political row leads to a court-martial, and Childers asks to be defended by his old buddy Colonel Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones), a desk-bound army lawyer whose life he saved in Vietnam 30 years before. Hays is a mediocre lawyer and semi-reformed drinker liable to fall off the wagon at any time. But never mind that: he's a Marine, and he knows what it's like to risk death under fire, and so only he has the kind of moral \u00dcbermensch status necessary to tackle this crisis. He's the only guy Terry can trust . </p> <p>In Humphrey Bogart's immortal phrase, it stinks up the screen. Jackson and Jones are less than convincing as soldiers of any sort, and by seeking to endow the Marines with both triumphal glamour and victim status, the film strikes more false notes than a platoon of pissed Banffshire pipers. Rules of Engagement turns on the very simple issue of whether there were armed terrorists concealed in the apparently unarmed demo crowd. If there were, Childers would obviously have some justification for his action. But through a tiresome sleight of hand, this information is withheld from us until the very end, thus maintaining a bogus narrative and moral tension. </p> <p>There is, we learn, a videotape recovered from one of the embassy's CCTV cameras, which could exonerate Terry. A sinister national security aide conceals it - naturally setting up our expectation of its eventual discovery at the 11th hour. But later, the evil aide burns it. Oh no! Our hero's only material evidence up in smoke! Will a copy be found? Er, no. Hays mutters some thing at the trial about a missing video but finally manages to persuade the khaki-clad jury to acquit his man with nothing more concrete than a heart-rending, choked-up speech about how as army folk they should not leave a Marine \"out to dry\". Over the closing credits, almost as an afterthought, we are perfunctorily informed that the corrupt video-hiding-and-burning aide has been busted. </p> <p>So the video muddle shows Stephen Gaghan's screenplay needed a few rewrites. But that is not the real insult to the intelligence. To garner evidence for the defence, Colonel Hodges goes out to Yemen and sees for himself the terrible civilian casualties, including a heartbreaking little girl with one leg, hobbling around on a crutch. This is the cue for one of the shortest dark nights of the soul on record. Hays gets drunk on the plane back and gets involved in a fist-fight with Jackson - which is quickly resolved by the two of them guffawing and slapping each other on the back. The issue of civilian casualties is just the pretext for some male bonding. </p> <p>The full queasy significance of this sugary pseudo-resolution does not, however, emerge until William Friedkin finally favours us with what Jackson actually saw before he opened fire: a lot of sinister dusky Ay-rabs with guns, hiding among the women and children in the demo - and the heartbreaking little girl was actually toting a weapon herself! You can't trust these towel-heads when they whinge about civilian deaths, you see... The sheer effrontery of that moment made me gasp. But it was nothing to what Friedkin produces at the finish: a North Vietnamese combat veteran wheeled out as a prosecution witness to testify to the nature of Terry's brutality to unarmed PoWs in 'Nam. Miraculously shedding his semi-drunken incompetence, Hays forces him in cross-examination to admit that he would do the same thing himself. And on the courtroom steps, over a rich violin swell, the greying Vietcong guy actually salutes the victorious Terry. </p> <p>It was at this moment that I moaned from the stalls: \"Oh for Christ's sake !\" We're used to self-pitying tough guys in uniform shouting at us that we can't handle the truth. But Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men at least had good performances and a sharp script. And David O Russell's Three Kings showed us that it is possible to make a modern war movie which is politically savvy, yet sympathetic to the choices faced by soldiers in battle. </p> <p>But all Friedkin serves up is a naive macho romp - with a little contemporary twist. As the bullets fly in Yemen, we see a photo on the wall of the ambassador's office of Bill Clinton, and another of Al Gore. In a later scene, the Clinton photo has for some reason disappeared. But Gore is still there - this year's little-fancied Democratic hopeful, presiding over this political betrayal of America's fighting man. Is Rules of Engagement the kind of Hollywood war film we can expect to see from now on? Compassionate nouveau Rambo for the George Bush Jr generation?</p>",

      "body": "<p>I have no Majorcan blood and if I consider myself a local lad it's not so much for having been born in Guillem Massot street in Palma or attending the village school, as for having suckled from the same breast as the majority of islanders: the <em>setrill</em>, the olive oil cruet. </p> <p>If children who share the same wet nurse are known as \"brothers in milk\", then consider me your \"brother in oil\". At the age of four, I came down with measles. The first sign of recovery, after a few days in bed, was this plea: \"Mother, I want a <em>pa amb oli</em>.\" At home, we have always taken the question of olive oil fairly seriously. We have more than 50 olive trees, and any casual visitor who drops by the house between October and February is likely to be handed an olive-picking basket. </p> <p>One year, a group of US students spent a winter in our village on a creative writing course and my father would lecture them while they picked olives for him. While I was studying typographic design at the London College of Printing, on one of those cold February days when not even a squirrel can be seen in Battersea Park, I came down with a case of that homesickness which all of us who have been born on <em>sa roqueta</em> (the little rock) have felt at some time or another, so I decided to perk myself up with a good plate of bread and oil. </p> <p>No sooner said than done: I popped into the local Sainsbury's to buy bread (sliced), tomatoes (from a greenhouse) and olive oil (with as much colour and character as sewing machine oil). The insipid, colourless result was no more than a plastic parody of the original. It immediately dawned on me that a <em>pa amb oli</em>, like experience itself, is not transferable. That is to say, as a concept, it doesn't \"travel well\" because its identity depends totally upon having the authentic ingredients at hand. </p> <p>The term <em>pa amb oli </em>means exactly that: bread and olive oil. It usually includes salt and scrubbed garlic, or sugar instead of salt for kids, if the oil is too strong or rancid. For the majority of today's islanders, the term includes tomato (in slices or scrubbed on to the bread) but most of the older generation still make a distinction: when I was a child, I would ask my mother for a slice of <em>pa amb oli</em>, and she would give it me plain. </p> <p>If I wanted it with tomato, I'd have to ask for it specially. The tomato, like the potato, is of course a relative newcomer - a question of centuries, not millennia - and neither has yet been granted full citizenship. The Majorcan <em>haute cuisine</em>, or <em>cuina de senyor</em>, served at the tables of the landed gentry, has received a big push lately at the expense of the authentic peasant fare, because today we're all <em>senyors</em>, more interested in satisfying our curiosity and palate than our body and soul. There are plenty of books on sale with full-page, four-colour glossies of Majorcan dishes, each more <em>recherch\u00e9</em>, sophisticated and aesthetically presented than the last, none of which was ever tasted by 99% of the population. Yet the reader will be lucky to find four lines dedicated to the basis of the diet: bread and oil. Shouldn't we be ashamed of ourselves? </p> <p>People say to me, incredulously: \"You mean to say you're writing a whole book about bread and oil?\" as if the subject warranted no more than a paragraph. Yet for centuries it was the pillar of the Balearic survival diet. It was the only thing left between hunger and starvation, feeding generation upon generation of islanders, and without it many would not be here today: it deserves full recognition. </p> <p>Perhaps this dish has been edited out of the cookery books because it appears too simple and thus unworthy of occupying space reserved for fancier recipes. The way I see it, preparing a plate of bread and oil is like playing good rock 'n' roll; it's so simple that few people can do it properly. </p> <p>The perfect <em>pa amb oli </em>has two secret ingredients: honesty and appetite. Neither of which is easy to find in the Balearics since we've become a society of abundance, indifference and cynicism, treating our islands as a tourist destination rather than the place in which we live.</p> <p>Much of today's urban youth in Majorca has grown up outside the domestic bread-and-oil tradition and has only now discovered, through the ever increasing network of <em>pa amb oli</em> cafes, a new way of eating healthily while out on the town. </p> <p>Most fast-food restaurants are conceptually based upon a battery-hen farm. Everything is thought out - decor, lighting, music, production lines, fodder that can be swallowed without chewing - to stuff the maximum amount of gizzards as fast, cheaply, hygienically and artificially as possible. </p> <p>The atmosphere is attractive when seen from the street (to capture the customer) but once inside, it is sterile and alienating (so that the customer has no desire to stay once he has finished his food, leaving the seat vacant for the next sucker). </p> <p>A <em>pa amb oli</em> cafe tends to be conceptually the opposite: relaxed, civilized and cosily welcoming, although not much to look at from the outside. It is decorated on a low budget with natural (or at least unpretentious) materials and discreet lighting; your order is served with proper cutlery, crockery and glassware, and nothing comes in a plastic container. The food is unprocessed and full of vitality, inciting the customer to get to grips with it: not just finger-lickin' good, but palm-wiping delicious. </p> <p>The youth of any nation, to become true citizens of the world, have to transcend their own culture; but to get to that point they first have to assimilate their own, not only intellectually but with all five senses: their music and language, smells, colours, tastes and textures. Bread and oil gives any young Majorcan a solid sense of his roots: island-dwelling, maritime, Mediterranean roots. </p> <p>The raw materials for a <em>pa amb oli</em> are, in proportion, immensely more expensive than those used in a pizza or hamburger (as most ethically produced things usually are) but the final price is similar to a fast-food meal. </p> <p>Several reasons can explain this: there's no expensive trademark one-upmanship, no high-rent prominent locations, and anyone running a <em>pa amb oli </em>cafe is obviously not aiming to get rich quick. The <em>pa amb oli</em> itself, being uncooked, is less open to manipulation in the kitchen (no deep-frying, microwaving, etc) while the ingredients, preserved using traditional techniques, contain few if any E additives: they usually are what they appear to be. </p> <p>\"At today's prices, a pizza will cost you more, but the ingredients for a <em>pa amb oli</em> have to be seen to be of better quality because they aren't disguised beneath a coat of melted cheese,\" says Xisco Cortes, who runs the Amano Bar. \"With this dish, which anyone can make at home, you can't cut corners by buying cheap ingredients; you have to serve a ham or cheese of a higher quality than the customer would usually buy at the supermarket, so that he really enjoys his meal.\" </p> <p>Most <em>pa amb oli</em> joints open only in the evenings, combining the social function of a pub or wine bar, the cultural function of a theatre-cafe (music, theatre, debates, poetry), and the practical one of a restaurant. S'Hostal, in Monuiri, began to make spectacular <em>pa amb olis</em> 30 years ago, but, one of the owners points out, \"It's only been over the last decade that the partying doesn't stop until well into the wee hours.\" </p> <p>This reflects the island's recent trend in decentralisation of night life from the city to the villages, as more young people move back to the rural areas. The bread and oil option allows cafes to offer more than just drinks (and avoid the problem of clients getting drunk on an empty stomach) without having to invest in costly kitchen equipment and space. </p> <p>\"The health authorities don't find much cause for concern when they inspect pa amb oli cafes, as long as the kitchen area is clean, because it's a dish which is bought, prepared and served; they don't need to poke about because you can't camouflage anything, it's all up front,\" says Xisco Cortes. </p> <p>\"If the bread-and-oil movement goes from strength to strength it's not just on the merits of the food, but because it's served in a very pleasant atmosphere, very much our own. Places like these all have Majorcan character, they offer good company, a good feeling and reasonable prices. I have two regular customers, a five-year-old and an eight-year-old, who prefer to come here than to go out and eat a hamburger.\" </p> <p>In the area around the Santa Catalina market, bread and oil is king, especially on a Friday night when it's almost impossible to find a table in any of the dozens of specialised cafes. \"A few years ago, this neighbourhood was on the decline,\" Xisco continues. \"It was a demeaning situation that the people who have always lived here didn't deserve. I really put my weight behind this project; others came along, thank God, and stood beside me. What we've achieved is that this area now has a solid future as a centre for bread and oil. This dish is the basis of my business.\" </p> <p>I think the time has come to vindicate and exalt this bread-and-oil culture because it sums up the best of our insular and Mediterranean selves. On the one hand, it reflects a simplicity, frugality, honesty and respect for tradition while on the other, the capacity to open up and adapt to outside influences without losing one's own identity. Partaking of a <em>pa amb oli </em>can be a solitary ritual conducive to introspection and withdrawal; but, if shared, it can lead beyond participation, into conversation and even end up as a party. </p> <p>This article is extracted from Bread &amp; Oil, Majorcan Culture's Last Stand, published by Prospect Books, price \u00a312 (including post and packaging).

The Majorcan haute cuisine, or cuina de senyor, served at the tables of the landed gentry, has received a big push lately at the expense of the authentic peasant fare, because today we're all senyors, more interested in satisfying our curiosity and palate than our body and soul. There are plenty of books on sale with full-page, four-colour glossies of Majorcan dishes, each more recherch\u00e9, sophisticated and aesthetically presented than the last, none of which was ever tasted by 99% of the population. Yet the reader will be lucky to find four lines dedicated to the basis of the diet: bread and oil. Shouldn't we be ashamed of ourselves? People say to me, incredulously: \"You mean to say you're writing a whole book about bread and oil?\" as if the subject warranted no more than a paragraph. Yet for centuries it was the pillar of the Balearic survival diet. It was the only thing left between hunger and starvation, feeding generation upon generation of islanders, and without it many would not be here today: it deserves full recognition. Perhaps this dish has been edited out of the cookery books because it appears too simple and thus unworthy of occupying space reserved for fancier recipes. The way I see it, preparing a plate of bread and oil is like playing good rock 'n' roll; it's so simple that few people can do it properly. The perfect pa amb oli has two secret ingredients: honesty and appetite. Neither of which is easy to find in the Balearics since we've become a society of abundance, indifference and cynicism, treating our islands as a tourist destination rather than the place in which we live. Much of today's urban youth in Majorca has grown up outside the domestic bread-and-oil tradition and has only now discovered, through the ever increasing network of pa amb oli cafes, a new way of eating healthily while out on the town. Most fast-food restaurants are conceptually based upon a battery-hen farm. Everything is thought out - decor, lighting, music, production lines, fodder that can be swallowed without chewing - to stuff the maximum amount of gizzards as fast, cheaply, hygienically and artificially as possible. The atmosphere is attractive when seen from the street (to capture the customer) but once inside, it is sterile and alienating (so that the customer has no desire to stay once he has finished his food, leaving the seat vacant for the next sucker). A pa amb oli cafe tends to be conceptually the opposite: relaxed, civilized and cosily welcoming, although not much to look at from the outside. It is decorated on a low budget with natural (or at least unpretentious) materials and discreet lighting; your order is served with proper cutlery, crockery and glassware, and nothing comes in a plastic container. The food is unprocessed and full of vitality, inciting the customer to get to grips with it: not just finger-lickin' good, but palm-wiping delicious. The youth of any nation, to become true citizens of the world, have to transcend their own culture; but to get to that point they first have to assimilate their own, not only intellectually but with all five senses: their music and language, smells, colours, tastes and textures. Bread and oil gives any young Majorcan a solid sense of his roots: island-dwelling, maritime, Mediterranean roots. The raw materials for a pa amb oli are, in proportion, immensely more expensive than those used in a pizza or hamburger (as most ethically produced things usually are) but the final price is similar to a fast-food meal. Several reasons can explain this: there's no expensive trademark one-upmanship, no high-rent prominent locations, and anyone running a pa amb oli cafe is obviously not aiming to get rich quick. The pa amb oli itself, being uncooked, is less open to manipulation in the kitchen (no deep-frying, microwaving, etc) while the ingredients, preserved using traditional techniques, contain few if any E additives: they usually are what they appear to be. \"At today's prices, a pizza will cost you more, but the ingredients for a pa amb oli have to be seen to be of better quality because they aren't disguised beneath a coat of melted cheese,\" says Xisco Cortes, who runs the Amano Bar. \"With this dish, which anyone can make at home, you can't cut corners by buying cheap ingredients; you have to serve a ham or cheese of a higher quality than the customer would usually buy at the supermarket, so that he really enjoys his meal.\" Most pa amb oli joints open only in the evenings, combining the social function of a pub or wine bar, the cultural function of a theatre-cafe (music, theatre, debates, poetry), and the practical one of a restaurant. S'Hostal, in Monuiri, began to make spectacular pa amb olis 30 years ago, but, one of the owners points out, \"It's only been over the last decade that the partying doesn't stop until well into the wee hours.\" This reflects the island's recent trend in decentralisation of night life from the city to the villages, as more young people move back to the rural areas. The bread and oil option allows cafes to offer more than just drinks (and avoid the problem of clients getting drunk on an empty stomach) without having to invest in costly kitchen equipment and space. \"The health authorities don't find much cause for concern when they inspect pa amb oli cafes, as long as the kitchen area is clean, because it's a dish which is bought, prepared and served; they don't need to poke about because you can't camouflage anything, it's all up front,\" says Xisco Cortes. \"If the bread-and-oil movement goes from strength to strength it's not just on the merits of the food, but because it's served in a very pleasant atmosphere, very much our own. Places like these all have Majorcan character, they offer good company, a good feeling and reasonable prices. I have two regular customers, a five-year-old and an eight-year-old, who prefer to come here than to go out and eat a hamburger.\" In the area around the Santa Catalina market, bread and oil is king, especially on a Friday night when it's almost impossible to find a table in any of the dozens of specialised cafes. \"A few years ago, this neighbourhood was on the decline,\" Xisco continues. \"It was a demeaning situation that the people who have always lived here didn't deserve. I really put my weight behind this project; others came along, thank God, and stood beside me. What we've achieved is that this area now has a solid future as a centre for bread and oil. This dish is the basis of my business.\" I think the time has come to vindicate and exalt this bread-and-oil culture because it sums up the best of our insular and Mediterranean selves. On the one hand, it reflects a simplicity, frugality, honesty and respect for tradition while on the other, the capacity to open up and adapt to outside influences without losing one's own identity. Partaking of a pa amb oli can be a solitary ritual conducive to introspection and withdrawal; but, if shared, it can lead beyond participation, into conversation and even end up as a party.

      "body": "<p>It would be easy to say that the attempt by Barclays to take over Woolwich, the former building society, should be left to market forces to decide. After all, traditional banks are facing threats from new telephone banks (like the Co-op) and internet-only ones (like Egg) which offer cheaper mortgages and higher interest rates on deposits. Part of their competitive advantage derives from the lower cost of electronic transactions and the fact that they do not have to bear the heavy fixed costs of branch networks. Since these circumstances make branch closures inevitable in the long term, the obvious course is to allow existing banks to merge so they can implement the rationalisation in a cost-effective way.</p> <p>Obvious, but wrong. There are two good reasons why rationalisation is too important to be left to the banks . First, they find it all too easy to abuse their collective market power. It was only pressure of public opinion that forced them to abandon their scheme last month to charge customers excessive amounts for using cash machines.

      "bodyText": "It would be easy to say that the attempt by Barclays to take over Woolwich, the former building society, should be left to market forces to decide. After all, traditional banks are facing threats from new telephone banks (like the Co-op) and internet-only ones (like Egg) which offer cheaper mortgages and higher interest rates on deposits. Part of their competitive advantage derives from the lower cost of electronic transactions and the fact that they do not have to bear the heavy fixed costs of branch networks. Since these circumstances make branch closures inevitable in the long term, the obvious course is to allow existing banks to merge so they can implement the rationalisation in a cost-effective way. Obvious, but wrong. There are two good reasons why rationalisation is too important to be left to the banks . First, they find it all too easy to abuse their collective market power. It was only pressure of public opinion that forced them to abandon their scheme last month to charge customers excessive amounts for using cash machines. Some of the banks were planning to charge \u00a31 a time for ordinary withdrawals, plus a 'disloyalty fee' of up to \u00a31.50, despite the fact that Don Cruickshank, the special investigator, had said that the real cost of a transaction was between 15p and 30p.

      "bodyText": "Barclays bank today made a recommended offer for Woolwich, valuing the former building society at \u00a35.4bn. The announcement comes two days after the banks revealed they were in talks which could lead to a takeover. Barclay's bid, which will be unanimously recommended by Woolwich's board, values each Woolwich share at 352p. Yesterday they closed at 337.5p. Sir Brian Jenkins, Woolwich chairman, said: \"This is a great deal for both Barclays and Woolwich shareholders. \"From the Woolwich we bring our popular brand, innovation and highly successful management team to join in this exciting venture. \"Combined with Barclays' strengths, we can all go forward changing the nature of retail banking in the United Kingdom.\" Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of Barclays, said: \"The acquisition of Woolwich is a key step for Barclays in developing its UK retail financial services business with a commercial fit which is highly complementary.\" However, the deal will impact on jobs and branch numbers, as Barclays aims to make cost savings of at least \u00a3150m a year by the end of the third year following the takeover. Part of the savings will be achieved by closing 100 branches from the combined group over the next three years, slimming branch numbers to 2,000. About 1,000 staff will also be cut from the enlarged group. The bank said the cut would be achieved through natural wastage and voluntary redundancy, wherever possible. Woolwich has more than 6,000 staff in the UK, operating from more than 400 branches, while Barclays employs more than 50,000 UK staff in 1,700 branches. Barclays aims to make head office cost savings by integrating the two bank's human resources and finance functions. It will keep Woolwich's base at Bexleyheath, Kent, following the deal, which it said would be a \"significant centre of employment\". Other cost savings would be achieved by integrating overseas operations, making savings from call centres, from IT systems and from the combination of mortgage processing and general insurance operations. Both bank brands, including separate Barclays and Woolwich branches, will be kept following the deal, and Woolwich will become the group's mortgage brand.",

      "bodyText": "Two goals from Mario Jardel gave the Uefa Cup holders Galatasaray a 2-1 win over the Swiss champions St Gallen in the first leg of their Champions League third qualifying round match. St Gallen took the lead in the 14th minute when Charles Amoah caught the Galatasaray keeper Claudio Taffarel off his line. The Ghanaian striker came close again 20 minutes later. But the unmarked Brazilian striker Jardel headed the Turkish side's equaliser in the 39th minute. The unfancied Swiss side had most of the chances in the second half but Jardel gave Galatasaray the lead after 78 minutes, sliding the ball through the Swiss defence. St Gallen finished with 10 men after Giuseppe Mazzarelli was sent off for a second bookable offence in the closing minutes. In the run-up to the match Swiss police had searched Galatasaray's hotel following an anonymous bomb threat. They found nothing. Dynamo Kiev and Yugoslavia's Red Star Belgrade drew 0-0 last night in a Champions League qualifier that the Ukrainians dominated. However, Red Star came close to snatching victory in the 88th minute when Valentin Belkevich hit the bar. Also in Ukraine, Tomas Dosek grabbed a late goal to give the Czech runners-up Slavia Prague a 1-0 away victory over Shakhtar Donetsk in their Champions League qualifier. Authorities in Milan arrested nine Croatian fans yesterday and held another 60 for questioning after they pelted passers-by and police with bottles and chairs before a Champions League qualifier between Dinamo Zagreb and Milan, won 3-1 by Milan. Police said at least four people were injured. The Sturm Graz striker Gerald Strafner was shown a red card yesterday - a day after he should have received it for two bookings in Tuesday's Champions League qualifier against Feyenoord. Uefa's disciplinary commission had issued the red card after the Norwegian referee Terje Hauge admitted having forgotten to send Strafner off in the first leg of the third qualifying round match which Sturm won 2-1. The mistake came four minutes into injury-time.",

Around 200 duly crammed into the Bantams Lounge of City's Carlsberg stand, chanting the player's name and hailing what is, only nine days before the start of the season, the bravest transfer gamble of the summer. </p> <p>Carbone, formerly of Internazionale, Sheffield Wednesday and Aston Villa, signed a \u00a36m four-year contract, incorporating a \u00a32m signing-on fee. He put pen to paper after a night of deliberations among the chairman, the player and his agent. </p> <p>\"Although this is my last contract, money isn't the most important thing,\" the Italian forward insisted. \"What is important is that the club want and trust me. That is what they made clear last night. That's why I came here.\" </p> <p>\"We had some options in the Premiership, not just one,\" said Giovanni Branchini, the player's agent. \"There was also the possibility to wait a bit longer and try to go back to Italy, which was Benito's original idea. But the task force from Bradford that came to Italy was very effective and touched the right strings.\" </p> <p>Presumably he was not referring to purse strings. For Richmond, who had already lost out on signing Paulo Wanchope from West Ham and had left City fans on tenterhooks when he claimed on Monday that he was on the verge of making \"the most exciting signing in the history of the club\", the completion of the deal clearly came as a relief. </p> <p>After a night of u-turns befitting the Italian's tetchy reputation, and with speculation rife that Coventry were poised to pip Bradford City at the post, a telephone call in the early hours from Branchini persuaded Richmond to cancel his 7.30am flight home. </p> <p>\"It was the longest night,\" he said. \"At around two in the morning I thought the deal was dead. But we got the call at 4am and, by 9am, Benito had slept on it and decided to commit his future to Bradford. </p> <p>\"We've had to look at the total financial package. Benito was available on a Bosman free, so we have worked out the total cost of the deal over four years without a transfer fee. We sit comfortably with the package we've negotiated.\" </p> <p>Carbone's ability to command such a wage is all the more surprising given his reputation off the pitch and inconsistency on it since he joined Sheffield Wednesday from Internazionale for \u00a33m in 1996. He left Wednesday under a cloud last season having fallen out with the manager Danny Wilson. </p> <p>A protracted loan spell at Aston Villa followed. It featured the odd spectacular goal - he scored only three in the Premiership and eight in all - the occasional tantrum and the acrimonious rejection of a \u00a325,000-a-week deal to remain in the west midlands. </p> <p>\"What happened at Villa wasn't my fault,\" Carbone insisted. \"I wanted to stay there but they did not contact either me or my agents over the summer.\" </p> <p>Though there were tentative approaches from Perugia and his former club Napoli, Italian interest was lukewarm. But the Bradford City chairman was not put off by Carbone's chequered past. \"We didn't need persuading to sign Benito,\" he added. \"We were desperately anxious to sign him. He's come here for all the right reasons. He's going to be a hero and a superstar here.\" </p> <p>Though Carbone has scored only 35 goals in his four seasons in England, the City manager Chris Hutchings is convinced that he has solved his side's goalscoring problem. \"I think he's a 20-goal striker,\" he said. \"We've got a fantastic player who can score unbelievable goals. That has to be exciting.\" </p> <p>Earlier in the day the Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson unveiled his own prospective goalscoring hero in the \u00a32.5m Croatian international Alen Boksic. </p> <p>Robson was quick to deny that the 30-year-old striker had moved to Teesside purely for financial reasons. \"Finance has not played a major part in this,\" he said. \"I tried to sign him a few years ago but he was not ready to leave Rome then. </p> <p>\"He knew that I wanted him here and that was the main factor. He wants the challenge now. He knows of our reputation, which is growing in Europe. This signing helps that process.\" </p> <p>Robson denied that the Croatian would earn almost \u00a363,000 a week at the Riverside but it is likely the striker will still pick up a weekly wage of nearly \u00a340,000 - that for a player who has only once scored 10 goals in a Serie A season and has struggled with knee problems. </p> <p>\"It is less tactical here than in Italy,\" Boksic said. \"There is far more space and my speed will be a big advantage.\" </p> <p><strong>Transfer timetable</strong></p> <p><strong> Monday</strong> Bradford's chairman Geoffrey Richmond announces that the club are set to make the \"the most exciting signing\" in their history. </p> <p><strong> Tuesday 10am:</strong> Carbone fails to arrive at Leeds/Bradford airport despite having agreed in principal to sign a four-year deal.

      "body": "<p> <strong>My Dad's earliest memory of cricket was peering over a wall in Edinburgh to see the Australians playing in 1948 (a very long time ago). Can you tell me any more about that game?</strong> asks Ben </p> <p>This match was played on September 13-14, 1948, and was the penultimate match of the \"Invincible\" Australians' unbeaten tour. The Australians made 236: Arthur Morris scored 112, and Don Bradman a comparatively modest 27. Scotland were bowled out for 85 (Bill Johnston 6-15) and 111 (Morris 5-10) as the tourists won by an innings and 40 runs. The last game of the tour, also against Scotland, was played at Aberdeen: the Australians won by an innings again, and Bradman marked his final appearance on British soil with 123 not out.</p> <p> <strong> Many years ago, when I was living in Swansea, I met Malcolm Nash, the bowler hit for six sixes in an over by Garry Sobers. When was that match? And has the feat been duplicated since?</strong> asks Bruce Bradley from Wisconsin, USA </p> <p>That famous match took place at Swansea in 1968. Sobers was playing for Nottinghamshire, and Nash for Glamorgan. Nash, usually a left-arm fast bowler, was experimenting with slower spinners at the time. Sobers was looking for quick runs before a declaration, and was hitting out. He was nearly out off the fifth ball, but the long-off fielder, Roger Davis, fell over the boundary after catching the ball and it was given as a six. </p> <p>Nash nearly suffered a repeat performance at Swansea nine years later, when Lancashire's Frank Hayes hit him for 34 in an over (the second ball went for four, the other five for sixes). Sobers's feat wasn't matched in first-class cricket until 1984-85, when Bombay's Ravi Shastri, the Indian Test allrounder, hit Tilak Raj of Baroda for six sixes in an over during a Ranji Trophy match at Bombay. </p> <p> <strong> Using one home umpire in Tests is harming cricket's image - he makes his presence felt in every series.

      "bodyText": "My Dad's earliest memory of cricket was peering over a wall in Edinburgh to see the Australians playing in 1948 (a very long time ago). Can you tell me any more about that game? asks Ben This match was played on September 13-14, 1948, and was the penultimate match of the \"Invincible\" Australians' unbeaten tour. The Australians made 236: Arthur Morris scored 112, and Don Bradman a comparatively modest 27. Scotland were bowled out for 85 (Bill Johnston 6-15) and 111 (Morris 5-10) as the tourists won by an innings and 40 runs. The last game of the tour, also against Scotland, was played at Aberdeen: the Australians won by an innings again, and Bradman marked his final appearance on British soil with 123 not out. Many years ago, when I was living in Swansea, I met Malcolm Nash, the bowler hit for six sixes in an over by Garry Sobers. When was that match? And has the feat been duplicated since? asks Bruce Bradley from Wisconsin, USA That famous match took place at Swansea in 1968. Sobers was playing for Nottinghamshire, and Nash for Glamorgan. Nash, usually a left-arm fast bowler, was experimenting with slower spinners at the time. Sobers was looking for quick runs before a declaration, and was hitting out. He was nearly out off the fifth ball, but the long-off fielder, Roger Davis, fell over the boundary after catching the ball and it was given as a six. Nash nearly suffered a repeat performance at Swansea nine years later, when Lancashire's Frank Hayes hit him for 34 in an over (the second ball went for four, the other five for sixes). Sobers's feat wasn't matched in first-class cricket until 1984-85, when Bombay's Ravi Shastri, the Indian Test allrounder, hit Tilak Raj of Baroda for six sixes in an over during a Ranji Trophy match at Bombay. Using one home umpire in Tests is harming cricket's image - he makes his presence felt in every series.

But now the surveillance show's makers are investigating a newspaper report that one contestant, Nicholas Bateman, 32, may have sneaked in a tiny Motorola mobile phone at the start. According to today's Sun, an \"associate\" of Nick rang in to allege the City trader was receiving daily reports from a friend about his fellow contestants' views and the way he is perceived by the viewing public.

But despite his growing unpopularity among the public at large, Nicholas has yet to be nominated for one of the weekly evictions by any of his fellow contestants. Earlier this week, Nicholas was seen confessing that he had lied to his housemates when he claimed early on in the nine-week experiment that his wife had been killed in a car crash. Another member of the house, Craig Phillips, said before the contest if he wins he will donate the \u00a370,000 prize money to a Downs Syndrome teenage girl from Shrewsbury who needs to travel to America for a life-saving operation.

The list was compiled by David Meeker, keeper of films at the National Film and Television Archive. Initially he drew up a list of 100 films, the aim being to build up a library of new show-prints for screening at the Museum of the Moving Image. But things got a little out of hand.

It is also a reference to the 360 degrees in a full circle (which it almost is, too). Why does the list end in 1981?

Meeker says there is now a film for every day of the year - which there almost is, there being 362 films on the list. It is also a reference to the 360 degrees in a full circle (which it almost is, too). Why does the list end in 1981? Because, Meeker says, we need the distance of time to assess whether a film is a classic - and going to 1981 allowed him to include Mad Max 2 1914 Cabiria (Pastrone) 1915 The Birth Of A Nation (Griffith) The Cheat (DeMille) 1916 Les Vampires (Feuillade) Intolerance - Love's Struggle Throughout The Ages (Griffith) Judex (Feuillade) 1918 J'accuse (Gance) Tih Minh (Feuillade) 1919 Karin Ingmarsdotter (Sjostrom) True Heart Susie (Griffith) The Oyster Princess (Lubitsch) 1920 Cabinet Of Dr Caligari (Wiene) 1921 La Roue (Gance) 1922 Foolish Wives (Von Stroheim) 1923 Gunnar Hedes Saga (Stiller) Die Nibelungen - Ein Deutsches Heldenlied I: Siegfrieds Tod (Lang) 1924 Die Nibelungen - Ein Deutsches Heldenlied II: Kriemhilds Rache (Lang) The Last Laugh (Murnau) The Navigator (Keaton/Crisp) Inhumaine (L'Herbier) The Extraordinary Adventures Of Mr West In The Land Of The Bolsheviks (Kuleshov) Greed (Von Stroheim) 1925 Stachka (Eisenstein) The Gold Rush (Chaplin) The Freshman Newmeyer/Taylor) Visages D'enfants (Feyder) The Unholy Three (Browning) Variet\u00e9/Vaudeville (Dupont) Tumbleweeds (Baggot) Battleship Potemkin (Eisenstein) Metropolis (Lang) 1926 Mother (Pudovkin) Po Zakonu/Dura Lex (Kuleshov) Hands Up!

It's The Season, an 84-page colour magazine which comes free on Monday August 14 with The Guardian. It's overflowing with facts, analysis, fixture lists and previews, it mentions all the up-coming European action, and... er... it's not available in Scotland. Sorry about that.</p> <p><strong>ROD, JANE AND ASHLEY</strong></p> <p>Hello Zippy! Hello Bungle! It's Bradford's Geoffrey Richmond here again, and if I don't sound like George out of Rainbow I'll give you all a big squeeze. Ooh, you liked that didn't you! Now back in May, when I said, \"Maybe in a year or two we could even win the Worthington or FA Cup and I feel we could soon be challenging for a European place,\" you all laughed didn't you? Well yesterday I made the \"most exciting signing in the club's history\" and today I've been busy finding a partner for young Benito. Oh, Geoffrey!</p> <p>And soon to be flying high above the streets and houses in Bradford is Blackburn's Ashley Ward, a big strapping mount of a lad who I've just agreed a fee of \u00a31.5m with Blackburn for. But don't worry Mr Bank Manager - I'm about to offload Lee Mills to Portsmouth for \u00a31m, with a further \u00a3175,000 to be added depending on appearances. Ooh, I'm so excited I want to break into song!</p> <p>But I won't call in Rod, Jane and Freddy just yet, because the deal isn't completed. \"We have agreed the fee with Blackburn for Ashley, but he still has one or two details to iron out with his club before we can proceed with talks,\" I told the world's media earlier today. But don't worry Bantams fans - I don't mind flying to Lancashire at the last minute or paying over-the-top wages to get my man! And as for Lee Mills? Well, he's \"due to have talks over personal terms with Portsmouth shortly, and he and his agent will be flying down this afternoon to start the ball rolling.\" And Bradford's ball will soon be rolling too, my lovelies - all the way to the top of the table! Now can somebody get me out of this window?</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"We had a great relationship and still have. Everything was always great between us and between him and his team-mates. They loved him to death. Our coaching staff loved him, the crowd loved him and the ladies at the training ground loved him. He got on great with everybody\" - So why was Benito Carbone offloaded by John Gregory (who has now officially taken Quote of the Day residence)?</p> <p><strong>THE KIDS AREN'T UNITED - THEY'RE ARSENAL</strong></p> <p>Arsene's Arsenal Wenger has been called many things in his illustrious career. As a player with Mutzig, Mulhouse and Strasbourg he was called Le Prof. With Grampus Eight in Japan he was known as Arsene-san. And now he laughs along as amusing English colleagues tease him with the first four letters of his name. But our research has shown he has never been called The Kidnapper... until now.</p> <p>You'll recall that defenceless child Guy Demel - \"a young Patrick Vieira\" - moved from Nimes to Highbury the other day. \"It's not a transfer, it's a kidnapping,\" Pierre Mosca, the football director at Nimes, ranted. \"I find it revolting that so-called big clubs use such methods to attract young talent.\" And before Mosca totally blew his top, there was just time to seethe: \"If Arsenal needs Demel, Arsenal needs help.\"</p> <p>Step forward The Kidnapper. He patted the blubbering child (er, 19-year-old French ace) on the head, handed him a Calippo and bridled: \"I am not happy at all with what [Mosca] has said. It harms our reputation. They had him on a one-year contract and did not offer him another one. We did everything right.\" So poor Mosca can have no retort. He has already acknowledged that, \"legally, Arsenal is in the right, but not ethically\". Even if the Arsenal boss did lead Demel to north London with promises of sweets and first-team football - stop singing that song, Spurs fans - Mosca will just have to bite his lip and call Wenger what everyone else at Arsenal does.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Chelsea are reported to be close to signing Italy defender Christian Panucci from Internazionale.

      "bodyText": "Protesters took to the streets throughout the northern Basque region of Spain today, after this week's upsurge in violence by Basque separatists Eta. Crowds outside the town hall in Pamplona hurled abuse at politicians from Euskal Herritarrok - widely considered to be Eta's political wing - as they walked across the square at the start of a five-minute silence to mark yesterday's shooting of an army officer in the city. When police asked to see their identity papers, a scuffle broke out and Juan Kruz Aldasoro, a member of the party's executive committee, was wrestled to the ground and detained. Police would not confirm what, if any, charges Mr Aldasoro would face. Since noon on Tuesday, two car bombs and a shooting have left two people dead and 11 injured. Since ending a 14-month cease-fire in December, Eta has been blamed for nine deaths in around 20 attacks. The Interior Ministry office for the Navarra region, the capital of which is Pamplona, said that Mr Aldasoro and other EH officials had requested permission to hold a demonstration in the area today, but that had been turned down. News agency Efe said that the rally would have been in memory of four suspected Eta members who blew themselves up Monday night as they drove through Bilbao in a car full of explosives. Spanish police said that they were on their way to stage an attack. While the Pamplona protest was taking place, other silent anti-Eta vigils were held in the Basque capital Vitoria and San Sebastian. At the same time, the Spanish met opposition leaders to discuss the upsurge in violence. All officials refused to make any comment as they left the meeting, but it seems likely that politicians will present a united front against the violence. Before this week's violence, Eta had staged nearly a dozen attacks over the previous month, including two political assassinations in July. The group has killed around 800 people since 1968, when it launched its campaign of violence for a Basque state in northern Spain and south west France. Eta maintained a ceasefire for 14 months until last, blaming the government for refusing to discuss its demands for self-rule.",

English class where?\" Reluctantly I declare myself. \"I teach English. Can I help you?\"</p> <p>The answer is that I can't. We have no more spaces in any of our classes for English as a second language (ESOL) in Newcastle. We have a file bulging with names and addresses of desperate refugees. We are no longer enrolling students, and I should tell him to come back in three months' time when our next sessions start.</p> <p>But I can't face the disappointment in his eyes. So we go upstairs and I ask him to write down his name and address and promise to get in touch if there are any spaces. \"But please you give me class soon,\" he begs. \"I come back again tomorrow.\" </p> <p>\"No, not tomorrow. Wait until we write to you,\" and I mimic the act of writing with an imaginary pencil in the air. </p> <p>\"I at home all day,\" he says. \"Do nothing. Need English. Need class.\"</p> <p>He starts to follow me into the staff-room to plead his case, and colleagues look up wearily. I manage to get rid of him at last, after marking his name with an asterisk and the words \"very keen\".</p> <p>We date all entries and try to offer places on a first-come, first-served basis, but many names have special pleas for clemency attached, and when we trawl the files we try to take these into account. We also have to work out whether to offer several classes to a few students, thereby enabling them to learn English more quickly, or one class a week to many students. We eventually decide to send notes round to all the ESOL staff again, asking them to look at their class lists and see if they can squeeze in a few extras.</p> <p>The week continues in the same pattern, the normal demands of teaching and administration being punctuated by the extra requests of the new arrivals in the corridors.</p> <p>We started our classes and filled them in last September, but huge numbers of asylum seekers began to arrive without warning in the middle of winter. We have laid on as many extra classes as we can without notice, but we are stretched to breaking point, as are other nearby colleges and ESOL centres.</p> <p>We have taken on new staff, thus increasing the overcrowding in our squalid staffroom. We are even busing students twice a day to a nearby campus where new IT facilities are proving a boon to the new refugee students. (Many with a smattering of English and an interest in computing have enrolled on a Start IT course while awaiting the holy grail of ESOL.)</p> <p>Meanwhile our role in the college extends far beyond that of mere teaching. We are worried about the students' living conditions. Some came to us from a hostel where there was no hot water for a week. They smelt so bad that teachers on enrolment duty were gagging as they filled in the forms. Others are suffering from the bad diets forced on them in these hostels, or from the fact that they have been housed out of town, but are not being given their bus fare to attend college. </p> <p>We find ourselves phoning social services to plead for students to be rehoused, as they have been placed in unsuitable accommodation without local consultation. Other teachers are phoning the churches to find out about second-hand clothing and furniture for our students. We have to deal with mental health problems too. Many asylum seekers are traumatised and deeply unhappy. A few are aggressive.</p> <p>We have always taken pride in our ESOL department, seeing ourselves as a happy and successful part of the college, efficiently led by a section leader who is professional and compassionate, and with classes of satisfied and hard-working students. </p> <p>Now we find ourselves exhausted, demoralised and embarrassed at having to turn so many people away. We are haunted by the corridor people, their faces pressed against the glass of our staffroom door. It feels as though we are in a kind of corridor, too, a halfway place between compassion and frustration, and Britain seems to be in a large corridor of its own, not sure whether it is helping asylum seekers or punishing them. </p> <p>One thing seems certain - if we continue to move vast numbers of people around the country to areas of high unemployment without any support systems for them, we are storing up trouble that will explode in a way that lowly further education teachers cannot control.</p> <p>I recently set a class the mundane homework task of designing an information leaflet for public library users. A Kurdish refugee wrote: \"You have to be careful when you choose the book because from those books which you will read, the Iraqi security service will know how do you think. You can find these books are against the Iraqi government but you cannot read them. If you read them, you will go to the prison as soon as possible.\"</p> <p>In a country where we have the luxury of reading the books of our choice, could we not also offer a little more practical help to people from countries where this is not possible?</p> <p>\u0095 Sue Stewart is an ESOL lecturer at Newcastle College, England</p>",

We started our classes and filled them in last September, but huge numbers of asylum seekers began to arrive without warning in the middle of winter. We have laid on as many extra classes as we can without notice, but we are stretched to breaking point, as are other nearby colleges and ESOL centres. We have taken on new staff, thus increasing the overcrowding in our squalid staffroom. We are even busing students twice a day to a nearby campus where new IT facilities are proving a boon to the new refugee students. (Many with a smattering of English and an interest in computing have enrolled on a Start IT course while awaiting the holy grail of ESOL.) Meanwhile our role in the college extends far beyond that of mere teaching. We are worried about the students' living conditions. Some came to us from a hostel where there was no hot water for a week. They smelt so bad that teachers on enrolment duty were gagging as they filled in the forms. Others are suffering from the bad diets forced on them in these hostels, or from the fact that they have been housed out of town, but are not being given their bus fare to attend college. We find ourselves phoning social services to plead for students to be rehoused, as they have been placed in unsuitable accommodation without local consultation. Other teachers are phoning the churches to find out about second-hand clothing and furniture for our students. We have to deal with mental health problems too. Many asylum seekers are traumatised and deeply unhappy. A few are aggressive. We have always taken pride in our ESOL department, seeing ourselves as a happy and successful part of the college, efficiently led by a section leader who is professional and compassionate, and with classes of satisfied and hard-working students. Now we find ourselves exhausted, demoralised and embarrassed at having to turn so many people away. We are haunted by the corridor people, their faces pressed against the glass of our staffroom door. It feels as though we are in a kind of corridor, too, a halfway place between compassion and frustration, and Britain seems to be in a large corridor of its own, not sure whether it is helping asylum seekers or punishing them. One thing seems certain - if we continue to move vast numbers of people around the country to areas of high unemployment without any support systems for them, we are storing up trouble that will explode in a way that lowly further education teachers cannot control. I recently set a class the mundane homework task of designing an information leaflet for public library users. A Kurdish refugee wrote: \"You have to be careful when you choose the book because from those books which you will read, the Iraqi security service will know how do you think. You can find these books are against the Iraqi government but you cannot read them. If you read them, you will go to the prison as soon as possible.\" In a country where we have the luxury of reading the books of our choice, could we not also offer a little more practical help to people from countries where this is not possible? \u0095 Sue Stewart is an ESOL lecturer at Newcastle College, England",

The powerful car bomb exploded minutes after an earlier, smaller blast had drawn a crowd of security forces and journalists to the scene. As yet, none of Kashmir's gaggle of guerrilla groups has claimed responsibility. Government sources have already discounted early speculation that the bomb was planted by the Hizbul Mujahiden, which is the biggest of the militant groups. The Hizbul fighters had called off a ceasefire on Tuesday, accusing the Indian government of failing to show good faith by involving Pakistan in peace talks. Since the ceasefire was declared on July 24, senior Indian officials, including former prime minister Inder Kumar Gujral, have been involved in frantic talks with Hizbul leaders and intermediaries. But other militant groups, apparently determined to sabotage the rickety peace process and outflank their Hizbul rivals, made sure that Kashmir remained bathed in blood. At the beginning of this month, more than 100 Hindus were massacred in Kashmir. Most were on religious pilgrimage to the mountains overlooking Srinagar. Now, it seems that the slender thread of hope offered by the Hizbul ceasefire has been snapped. The chaotic guerrilla campaign has claimed tens of thousands of lives since it erupted in the late 1980s. India has regularly accused Pakistan of arming and training the insurgents, especially Hizbul, and the two countries' armies have frequently exchanged artillery fire along the 1948 ceasefire line that separates them. At the dawn of independence, Kashmir became part of India on the whim of its Hindu maharajah, and to the dismay of its overwhelmingly Muslim people. Pakistan's forces invaded, but were restricted to the mountainous western third of the state. Many Kashmiris long for independence from both India and Pakistan.

But for several years in the late 1970s, if the current edition of GQ magazine is to be believed, an improbable proportion of it took an unlikely detour via the guts of a blond and baby-faced soft-drink delivery boy of rightwing sympathies called William Hague.

And its journey thereafter is usually simple enough - taking in the stomachs of a few bar-propping heavyweights of advancing years and ending up as often as not in the porcelain urinals of the same establishments. But for several years in the late 1970s, if the current edition of GQ magazine is to be believed, an improbable proportion of it took an unlikely detour via the guts of a blond and baby-faced soft-drink delivery boy of rightwing sympathies called William Hague. At every pub where his father's delivery van stopped, Hague told the magazine, he'd have a pint: \"You worked so hard you didn't feel you'd drunk 10 pints by four o'clock.

The vigilante group - which had until today threatened to keep the protest up until all alleged paedophiles were driven off the Paulsgrove estate and the government agreed to tag all sex offenders - said it would suspend the demonstrations to take part in talks with Portsmouth city council. Up to 300 people took to the streets last night, targeting the homes of three alleged paedophiles in what was the seventh night of vigilante protests on the estate. A spokesman for Portsmouth city council today confirmed that a fifth family had been moved into temporary accommodation but would not confirm if they had been targeted by last night's protest or had asked to move because of the demonstrations. A five-point \"peace plan\" has already been put into action in a bid to reduce tension on the estate, the spokesman said. Police revealed yesterday that four innocent families had been forced to leave the estate in the wake of gossip that falsely accused them of harbouring paedophiles. Protest leaders maintain their aim is not to intimidate innocent people but to rid the area of sex offenders.

      "bodyText": "When eccentric billionaire Ross Perot founded it in 1992, the Reform Party pledged itself to reform the American political system. But following a bizarre rumpus between party members gathering for their convention in Long Beach, it seems that what is in the greatest need of reform is the party itself. What was intended as a rallying point for the party's presidential bid has turned into high farce with the possibility that, by the end of the week, there will be two Reform Parties, two Reform Party candidates and one big, fat law suit. On one side of the row are supporters of Pat Buchanan - the gung-ho, right-wing former Republican who only joined the party last autumn. In the opposite corner are those who accuse him and his supporters of hijacking the party and turning it from a libertarian crusade into a conservative pressure group that will do nothing to capture the electorate's imagination. The row came to a head on Tuesday afternoon when the national committee split into factions, with each side claiming to represent the party and local police being called to restore order. The Buchanan brigaders claimed victory but the opposition dispute the claim and say they will nominate their own candidate, Iowa physicist John Hagelin, who is also the Natural Law Party's candidate. Buchanan himself was missing from the early fracas although his doughty sister Bay Buchanan was battling on his behalf. When he arrived in Long Beach on Wednesday afternoon he ridiculed his opponents, laughed at their claims that his supporters were \"storm troopers\" and claimed \"we built a party where it didn't exist.\" Over the next few days, the two factions will each be running separate operations to validate the credentials of delegates and each will be claiming to be the true voice of the party. The anti-Buchanan camp claim that his supporters have filed false ballot papers and committed electoral fraud. The party secretary Jim Mangia, who opposes Buchanan, said on local radio: \"I think Pat Buchanan is corrupt and his campaign is corrupt.\" It was over such feuding that the party lost the support of its most famous elected official, Minnesota governor and wrestler, Jesse Ventura Now the party is in danger of becoming a laughing stock with the anti-Buchananites asking the media in to watch what was happening, while the pro-Buchananites wanted their meeting held in secret. As the temperature outside the convention centre climbed towards the nineties, the heat also rose inside the two hotels where the separate camps were meeting to plan their next moves. Yesterday, bemused delegates arriving from across the country were puzzled by the chaos that confronted them, although some clearly found it refreshing after last week's heavily stage-managed and unspontaneous Republican Convention in Philadelphia. The row will be overshadowed when the Democrats start gathering at the weekend for their own convention in Los Angeles, but it may have dealt the Reform Party a blow from which it will be difficult to recover. Polls already polls suggest that, if voters are leaning towards a third party, it will be the Green Party. Its candidate, Ralph Nader, is now achieving 10 per cent ratings in some states and could benefit from libertarian, anti-government voters who may have been put off by this week's unseemly brawling in Long Beach.",

But no average human being will be able to navigate all the world's available digital entertainment. Even with the conventional tools for building boring web sites, the amount of data on the web is doubling annually. Soon we will be out of the messy experimentation and the gentle academic internet of the 1980s and 1990s into serious business and commerce. Instead of the annoyance of the \"Illegal operation\", we will not be allowed to fail. The combination of ruthless retail, intelligent systems and unlimited capacity has the potential to overwhelm us. On the other hand, we will be able to buy intelligent systems that work for us against the salesmen. The crunch will come when the dot.coms can survive only on the sale of advertising. What will happen when our privately purchased software automatically cleans out the stuff we don't want, even while we sleep?",

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blasts, which come two days after Kashmir's main guerrilla group Hezb-ul-Mujahideen called off a 15-day ceasefire and ended talks with the Indian government. Kashmir has been wracked by a separatist movement since 1989, during which guerrilla groups have fought with security forces, leaving 25,000 people dead. Guerrillas massacred 102 people on August 1 and 2 in nine attacks in towns and villages in southern Kashmir. The militants want Kashmir to break away from India and become independent or merge with Pakistan. Hezb-ul Mujahedeen announced a ceasefire on July 24, angering other militant groups opposed to talks that did not involve them or Pakistan. They called off the ceasefire on Tuesday, saying that Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had refused to involve Pakistan in the dialogue.",

For the past two years Chelsea have finished up with the second best defensive record in the Premiership. And while Leboeuf's defending and De Goey confidence at coming for crosses is often rightly questioned, the fact remains that they have Desailly, who is - when he wants to be - the best defender in the world.

And with Stanic on the right and Poyet on the left the midfield should ooze goals. Then there's the defence. For the past two years Chelsea have finished up with the second best defensive record in the Premiership. And while Leboeuf's defending and De Goey confidence at coming for crosses is often rightly questioned, the fact remains that they have Desailly, who is - when he wants to be - the best defender in the world. And according to reports he'll soon be joined by Internazionale's Christian Panucci. All this makes a strong case for Chelsea being in a great position to finally smash the hegemony of Manchester United and Arsenal. So why haven't we all tipped them for the title? Put it down to mystery factor X: their lack of motivation. Because too often Chelsea are wonderful then woeful. They can beat the best sides in Europe one week and then get bashed up by Sunderland the next. Maybe this season will be different. Maybe Gianluca Vialli will get his side to battle in every game, Leboeuf will be tighter in defence, and Stanic will prove he's worth \u00a35.6m. And maybe, without the distraction of the Champions League, the foreign stars will be more focused too. But that's just too many maybes to be completely confident in backing Chelsea to go all the way. They will come close though. In J-F Hasselbaink (A Madrid), Eidur Gudjohnsen (Bolton), Mario Stanic (Parma), Carlo Cudicini (Castel D.S.), Sebastien Kniessel (Eintracht Frankfurt). Out Chris Sutton (Celtic), Kyle Shepphard (Bristol City), Neil Clement (West Brom), Dan Petrescu (Bradford). Odds: 6-1 Football Unlimited writers' prediction: 3rd Agree? Disagree?

      "body": "<p>Governments all over the world have suddenly become embroiled in controversy about electronic surveillance of the internet. In the United States, a political storm has arisen over a new FBI internet tapping system codenamed Carnivore. In Britain, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Act has just extended telephone-tapping powers to cover internet service providers (ISPs), and allows the government to arrange indiscriminate tapping or email interception for foreign police forces and security agencies. </p> <p>In the Netherlands, the Dutch security service BVD admitted two weeks ago that it has been collecting emails sent abroad by companies. In the Hague, laws are being prepared to allow the Justice Ministry to tap into email and subscriber records, scan messages and mobile phone calls, and track users' movements. </p> <p>The Australian government has passed laws allowing security agents to attack and modify computers secretly to obtain information. Many other governments have similar schemes in the pipeline. </p> <p>These developments are no coincidence but the direct result of secret planning over seven years by an international co-ordinating group set up by the FBI, after Congress twice refused to extend its telephone tapping powers for digital networks. Under the innocuous title of the International Law Enforcement Telecommunications Seminar (ILETS), the group has met annually to plan for and lobby to make telecommunications systems \"interception-friendly\". </p> <p>ILETS excluded lawyers and industry specialists who might have advised on the arrangements to protect privacy and human rights, or on the feasi bility and cost of the intelligence officers' wish list of interception requirements. As a result, the laws based on their recommendations have repeatedly caused controversy. </p> <p>The work of ILETS first came to light in late 1997, when a British researcher, Tony Bunyan, revealed collaboration between EU staff and the FBI for many years. Details of plans to compel ISPs all over the world to install secret internet interception \"black boxes\" in their premises appeared in <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,3859496,00.html\">Online</a> last year. </p> <p> A month ago, the European Parliament appointed 36 MEPs to lead a year-long investigation into Echelon - the codename for a mainly US system for monitoring traffic on commercial communications satellites. Echelon has become common parlance for the worldwide electronic eavesdropping or signals intelligence (Sigint) network run by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) together with the US National Security Agency (NSA). The inquiry will ask if the rights of European citizens are adequately protected and ascertain whether European industry is put at risk by the global interception of communications. </p> <p>French politicians and lawyers have taken the lead in accusing the US and Britain of using their electronic intelligence networks to win business away from foreign rivals. US politicians have riposted that France runs a worldwide electronic intelligence system of its own - \"Frenchelon\", based at Domme, near Sarlat in the Dordogne, and includes an eavesdropping station in New Caledonia in the Pacific (see <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/ 2000/25/ns-16207.html\">www.zdnet.co.uk/news/ 2000/25/ns-16207.html</a>). </p> <p>Electronic eavesdropping has become a battleground between the US and Russia. The Russian-American Trust and Cooperation Act of 2000, passed on July 19, stops President Clinton rescheduling or writing off billions of dollars of Russian debts unless a Russian spy base in Cuba is \"permanently closed\". </p> <p>This base at Lourdes, located on leased land near Havana, was the former Soviet Union's most important intelligence facility. It uses Echelon-type systems to collect data from telephone calls and satellite links covering the US. </p> <p>Lourdes allegedly provides \"between 60% and 70% of all Russian intelligence data about the US\". A defector has said that spying from Lourdes has grown dramatically following an order by Boris Yeltsin to step up economic and technological espionage against the west. </p> <p>The White House wants to stop the campaign to close Lourdes because other countries might then ask the US to close down its identical bases. Documents suggest the US would particularly fear the Lourdes effect spreading to Britain, Germany and Australia, where the NSA operates large sites. Its station at Menwith Hill, Yorkshire, is the largest electronic intelligence base in the world. </p> <p>The US is not alone in this spying. By the end of the year, the Government Technical Assistance Centre (GTAC) will have begun operations from inside MI5's headquarters at Thames House, Millbank. Its primary purpose will be to break codes used for private email or to protect files on personal computers. It will also receive and hold private keys to codes which British computer users may be compelled to give to the government, under the RIP Act. </p> <p>Development of GTAC has been pioneered by the Home Office's Encryption Co-ordination Unit, which says that the centre will \"provide the capability to produce plain text/images/audio from lawfully intercepted communications and lawfully seized computer media which are encrypted\". The Home Office has not confirmed reports that GTAC will also be the collecting point for intercepted internet communications relayed from the \"sniffer\" boxes to be installed inside British ISPs. </p> <p>The cost of building GTAC, said to be \u00a325m, is likely to include the price of ultra-fast super-computers, of the type previously used only to break Soviet codes and attack other special military targets. Code breakers from the communications intelligence agency GCHQ will be seconded to work at GTAC. </p> <p>GCHQ has used sophisticated computers for many years to examine foreign or \"external\" messages and phone calls, as part of the worldwide intelligence network operated with other English-speaking countries. The key part of this system utilises computers called Dictionaries, which hold lists of thousands of target names, addresses and key words. They are used to select messages of interest, while discarding the majority of communications. </p> <p>GCHQ was not normally permitted to encroach on domestic communications. Now the RIP Act says that as many domestic internet communications travel on the same \"trunks\" as external communications, GCHQ will be allowed to trawl through these messages without restriction. </p> <p>Another limitation, which had prevented the direct targeting of people in Britain by GCHQ without specific authorisation has also been dropped. The Home Secretary has been given powers under Section 16 (3) of the Act to sign an \"overriding\" warrant every three months. This will allow general surveillance without the need for individual warrants. </p> <p>This will apply to \"serious crime\", which can include organising demonstrations that may affect public order. The government has offered no justification for its willingness to allow GCHQ to intrude on domestic political and policing matters. The RIP act will also allow any agency nominated by the Home Secretary to tap into the addresses of emails sent and received (though not their content) without a warrant. </p> <p> Caspar Bowden, whose lobbying organisation, the <a href=\"http://www.fipr.org\">Foundation for Information Policy Research</a>, FIPR, helped to bring some important changes to the RIP Act, believes that letting Dictionary type computers carry out broad-ranging surveillance on much internal UK traffic will break the new Human Rights Act. </p> <p>The FBI has just been granted funds for an $85m electronic surveillance programme called Digital Storm. This foresees the quadrupling of telephone tapping in the US over the next decade, because of the convenience of digital processing and the automated delivery of intercepted messages and conversations to FBI agents. </p> <p>The FBI hopes to build in automated transcription and translation systems. According to its budget application for the next US fiscal year, a related programme called Casa de Web will include central computer archives for intercepted audio and data reports. It will also provide \"analytic tools for automated speaker identification, text key word spotting, and voice key word spotting\". </p> <p>The existence of Carnivore, the FBI tapping system, was revealed three months ago as the result of a lawsuit between a US ISP and federal marshals, who demanded that the ISP wire a Carnivore box into its network. The FBI initially wanted to install its own version of a commercial \"sniffer\" programme called Etherpeek. Then it turned up with Carnivore and a court order to install it. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/programs/carnivore/carnivore.htm\">The FBI</a> claims there are only 20 Carnivores, and that they have been used only 25 times in the last 18 month. But the system is so controversial that the US Congress held special hearings two weeks ago. A judge has ordered the FBI to answer requests for details made under the Freedom of Information Act. </p> <p>Carnivore consists of a laptop computer and communications interface cards. It runs a packet sniffer programme to select the data it wants from inside the ISP local network. According to Marcus Thomas, head of the FBI's Cyber Technology Section, they are PCs using proprietary software and acting as a \"specialized sniffer\". </p> <p>The bureau claims that although Carnivore's hardware sees all the traffic passing through the ISP where it is installed, its software looks only at the origin and the destination of each internet packet. If the addresses correspond with those specifically authorised in a court order, then the information and/or the contents are extracted and forwarded to the FBI. The agency claims no other data is recorded or examined. </p> <p>But US computer experts do not believe this is possible. For example, many ISPs dynamically allocate internet addresses to their customers. This means that every time you dial in to your ISP, you will use a different internet address. Unless Carnivore is also intercepting this type of data, it cannot work. </p> <p>The experts have asked the FBI to reveal the source code of Carnivore. The FBI has refused, but says it will arrange a \"privacy audit\". US Attorney General Janet Reno has publicly regretted the woodenheaded selection of the codename Carnivore. She says it will soon be changed to a less threatening name. </p> <p> Despite the power of systems such as Echelon or Carnivore, they face many practical difficulties in conducting the type of extensive surveillance that some people fear. </p> <p>The risk they pose to civil liberties has often been questioned because of the simple techniques that criminals or terrorists can use to outrun surveillance. </p> <p>Setting up new internet accounts and email addresses to use for a few days or weeks takes barely a minute to do, yet can limit or defeat law enforcement or intelligence targeting. </p> <p>For the ordinary computer user who wants their email and web surfing activities to regain at least the same level of privacy enjoyed by ordinary letters, the best and probably the only tool to use is a system called Freedom. </p> <p>Pioneered by the Canadian-based Zero Knowledge company, Freedom uses multiple encrypted links to carry every kind of internet traffic. The first step is a secure connection to a local ISP running a Freedom server. Several are now operating in Britain. Your message, re-encrypted each time it travels, is passed among one or more Freedom servers before being inserted onto the internet at a distant location. The system used means that no one, including Zero Knowledge itself and the ISPs you use, knows what messages are being sent or who is sending them. </p> <p>For those less worried about intelligence agencies but infuriated by the privacy-destroying habits of some websites and internet companies, the American-based Junkbusters group offers an excellent free tool which stops unwarranted data collection and also limits the time-wasting effects of downloading of advertising material. </p> <p> Systems like Carnivore and the black boxes, which MI5 and the police want to install soon in British ISPs, are based on internet technologies used every day by network managers and trouble-shooters. </p> <p>Packet sniffers utilise the fact that all the traffic being handled by an ISP will travel on one or more very high-speed data links. These typically handle hundreds or even thousands of megabits of data every second. </p> <p>Everyone's data travels on these shared links, in the form of datagrams, or packets of data. Each packet contains details of the sender and the intended destination of the data packet. In principle, this information can be used to select only the data being sent to or received by the target of a government approved warrant. </p> <p>But the ISP has no way of knowing how much data is being extracted from their clients' private messages. It all depends on how the software is programmed, and this is kept secret. </p> <p>One program used by the FBI to tap email is Etherpeek, which can be programmed to select any type of data from an internet data stream. Its manufacturers say it can \"capture all conversations on a network segment, much like a tele phone tap\". It costs less than $1,000 to buy and may be the proprietary software used for Carnivore. </p> <p>Another commercial packet sniffer modified for internet surveillance is WireSpeed, which can analyse more than 300 different network types. The WireSpeed analyser, developed by a US corporation, Radcom, was recommended for use in a recent Home Office report, which noted that it was \"a major component of another country' s interception solution - it would enable the user to view the content portion(s) of electronic messages\". </p> <p>Industry and civil liberties critics in Britain and the US say that packet-sniffing technology is so powerful and undetectable, that it poses a threat to civil liberties and privacy that could not have existedpreviously. As even the ISP to whose equipment it is connected will not know what it is doing, there can be no means of verifying that surveillance is being limited to what is legally allowed. </p> <p> <strong> Links</strong> </p> <p><strong> Freedom internet privacy protection system </strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.zeroknowledge.com\">www.zeroknowledge.com</a><br> <strong> Junkbuster</strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/ijb.html\">www.junkbusters.com/ht/en/ijb.html</a> <br> <strong> WireSpeed Internet Analyser </strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.radcom-inc.com/products/wire-spec.htm\">www.radcom-inc.com/products/wire-spec.htm</a> <br> <strong>Etherpeek packet sniffer </strong> <br> <a href=\"http://www.aggroup.com/products/etherpeek\">www.aggroup.com/products/etherpeek </a> </p> <p>\u0095 Duncan Campbell is a freelance investigative journalist and not the Guardian's Los Angeles correspondent of the same name.</p>",

The inquiry will ask if the rights of European citizens are adequately protected and ascertain whether European industry is put at risk by the global interception of communications. French politicians and lawyers have taken the lead in accusing the US and Britain of using their electronic intelligence networks to win business away from foreign rivals. US politicians have riposted that France runs a worldwide electronic intelligence system of its own - \"Frenchelon\", based at Domme, near Sarlat in the Dordogne, and includes an eavesdropping station in New Caledonia in the Pacific (see www.zdnet.co.uk/news/ 2000/25/ns-16207.html). Electronic eavesdropping has become a battleground between the US and Russia. The Russian-American Trust and Cooperation Act of 2000, passed on July 19, stops President Clinton rescheduling or writing off billions of dollars of Russian debts unless a Russian spy base in Cuba is \"permanently closed\". This base at Lourdes, located on leased land near Havana, was the former Soviet Union's most important intelligence facility. It uses Echelon-type systems to collect data from telephone calls and satellite links covering the US. Lourdes allegedly provides \"between 60% and 70% of all Russian intelligence data about the US\". A defector has said that spying from Lourdes has grown dramatically following an order by Boris Yeltsin to step up economic and technological espionage against the west. The White House wants to stop the campaign to close Lourdes because other countries might then ask the US to close down its identical bases. Documents suggest the US would particularly fear the Lourdes effect spreading to Britain, Germany and Australia, where the NSA operates large sites. Its station at Menwith Hill, Yorkshire, is the largest electronic intelligence base in the world. The US is not alone in this spying. By the end of the year, the Government Technical Assistance Centre (GTAC) will have begun operations from inside MI5's headquarters at Thames House, Millbank. Its primary purpose will be to break codes used for private email or to protect files on personal computers. It will also receive and hold private keys to codes which British computer users may be compelled to give to the government, under the RIP Act. Development of GTAC has been pioneered by the Home Office's Encryption Co-ordination Unit, which says that the centre will \"provide the capability to produce plain text/images/audio from lawfully intercepted communications and lawfully seized computer media which are encrypted\". The Home Office has not confirmed reports that GTAC will also be the collecting point for intercepted internet communications relayed from the \"sniffer\" boxes to be installed inside British ISPs. The cost of building GTAC, said to be \u00a325m, is likely to include the price of ultra-fast super-computers, of the type previously used only to break Soviet codes and attack other special military targets. Code breakers from the communications intelligence agency GCHQ will be seconded to work at GTAC. GCHQ has used sophisticated computers for many years to examine foreign or \"external\" messages and phone calls, as part of the worldwide intelligence network operated with other English-speaking countries. The key part of this system utilises computers called Dictionaries, which hold lists of thousands of target names, addresses and key words. They are used to select messages of interest, while discarding the majority of communications. GCHQ was not normally permitted to encroach on domestic communications. Now the RIP Act says that as many domestic internet communications travel on the same \"trunks\" as external communications, GCHQ will be allowed to trawl through these messages without restriction. Another limitation, which had prevented the direct targeting of people in Britain by GCHQ without specific authorisation has also been dropped. The Home Secretary has been given powers under Section 16 (3) of the Act to sign an \"overriding\" warrant every three months. This will allow general surveillance without the need for individual warrants. This will apply to \"serious crime\", which can include organising demonstrations that may affect public order. The government has offered no justification for its willingness to allow GCHQ to intrude on domestic political and policing matters. The RIP act will also allow any agency nominated by the Home Secretary to tap into the addresses of emails sent and received (though not their content) without a warrant. Caspar Bowden, whose lobbying organisation, the Foundation for Information Policy Research, FIPR, helped to bring some important changes to the RIP Act, believes that letting Dictionary type computers carry out broad-ranging surveillance on much internal UK traffic will break the new Human Rights Act. The FBI has just been granted funds for an $85m electronic surveillance programme called Digital Storm. This foresees the quadrupling of telephone tapping in the US over the next decade, because of the convenience of digital processing and the automated delivery of intercepted messages and conversations to FBI agents. The FBI hopes to build in automated transcription and translation systems. According to its budget application for the next US fiscal year, a related programme called Casa de Web will include central computer archives for intercepted audio and data reports. It will also provide \"analytic tools for automated speaker identification, text key word spotting, and voice key word spotting\". The existence of Carnivore, the FBI tapping system, was revealed three months ago as the result of a lawsuit between a US ISP and federal marshals, who demanded that the ISP wire a Carnivore box into its network. The FBI initially wanted to install its own version of a commercial \"sniffer\" programme called Etherpeek. Then it turned up with Carnivore and a court order to install it. The FBI claims there are only 20 Carnivores, and that they have been used only 25 times in the last 18 month. But the system is so controversial that the US Congress held special hearings two weeks ago. A judge has ordered the FBI to answer requests for details made under the Freedom of Information Act. Carnivore consists of a laptop computer and communications interface cards. It runs a packet sniffer programme to select the data it wants from inside the ISP local network. According to Marcus Thomas, head of the FBI's Cyber Technology Section, they are PCs using proprietary software and acting as a \"specialized sniffer\". The bureau claims that although Carnivore's hardware sees all the traffic passing through the ISP where it is installed, its software looks only at the origin and the destination of each internet packet. If the addresses correspond with those specifically authorised in a court order, then the information and/or the contents are extracted and forwarded to the FBI. The agency claims no other data is recorded or examined. But US computer experts do not believe this is possible. For example, many ISPs dynamically allocate internet addresses to their customers. This means that every time you dial in to your ISP, you will use a different internet address. Unless Carnivore is also intercepting this type of data, it cannot work. The experts have asked the FBI to reveal the source code of Carnivore. The FBI has refused, but says it will arrange a \"privacy audit\". US Attorney General Janet Reno has publicly regretted the woodenheaded selection of the codename Carnivore. She says it will soon be changed to a less threatening name. Despite the power of systems such as Echelon or Carnivore, they face many practical difficulties in conducting the type of extensive surveillance that some people fear. The risk they pose to civil liberties has often been questioned because of the simple techniques that criminals or terrorists can use to outrun surveillance. Setting up new internet accounts and email addresses to use for a few days or weeks takes barely a minute to do, yet can limit or defeat law enforcement or intelligence targeting. For the ordinary computer user who wants their email and web surfing activities to regain at least the same level of privacy enjoyed by ordinary letters, the best and probably the only tool to use is a system called Freedom. Pioneered by the Canadian-based Zero Knowledge company, Freedom uses multiple encrypted links to carry every kind of internet traffic. The first step is a secure connection to a local ISP running a Freedom server. Several are now operating in Britain. Your message, re-encrypted each time it travels, is passed among one or more Freedom servers before being inserted onto the internet at a distant location. The system used means that no one, including Zero Knowledge itself and the ISPs you use, knows what messages are being sent or who is sending them. For those less worried about intelligence agencies but infuriated by the privacy-destroying habits of some websites and internet companies, the American-based Junkbusters group offers an excellent free tool which stops unwarranted data collection and also limits the time-wasting effects of downloading of advertising material. Systems like Carnivore and the black boxes, which MI5 and the police want to install soon in British ISPs, are based on internet technologies used every day by network managers and trouble-shooters. Packet sniffers utilise the fact that all the traffic being handled by an ISP will travel on one or more very high-speed data links. These typically handle hundreds or even thousands of megabits of data every second. Everyone's data travels on these shared links, in the form of datagrams, or packets of data. Each packet contains details of the sender and the intended destination of the data packet. In principle, this information can be used to select only the data being sent to or received by the target of a government approved warrant. But the ISP has no way of knowing how much data is being extracted from their clients' private messages. It all depends on how the software is programmed, and this is kept secret. One program used by the FBI to tap email is Etherpeek, which can be programmed to select any type of data from an internet data stream. Its manufacturers say it can \"capture all conversations on a network segment, much like a tele phone tap\". It costs less than $1,000 to buy and may be the proprietary software used for Carnivore. Another commercial packet sniffer modified for internet surveillance is WireSpeed, which can analyse more than 300 different network types. The WireSpeed analyser, developed by a US corporation, Radcom, was recommended for use in a recent Home Office report, which noted that it was \"a major component of another country' s interception solution - it would enable the user to view the content portion(s) of electronic messages\". Industry and civil liberties critics in Britain and the US say that packet-sniffing technology is so powerful and undetectable, that it poses a threat to civil liberties and privacy that could not have existedpreviously. As even the ISP to whose equipment it is connected will not know what it is doing, there can be no means of verifying that surveillance is being limited to what is legally allowed.

Better still, I'm paying less for internet access than I have for years. My British Telecom phone bill has plunged from \u00a3350 a quarter in July 1998 (and that, sadly, was not a record) to just \u00a372 for the same quarter this year. </p> <p>That is not the whole story, because some of the costs have shifted to extra lines and mobile phones. We used to have one line for three people, whereas now we have four lines - two BT lines, two Telewest lines - and three mobile phones. Well, my 15 year old son runs a couple of websites and my wife has friends. But even adding up all the bills, we're still spending only half what we used to. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bt.com/surftime/\">BT Surftime</a>, announced in March, provides unmetered net access in the evenings and at weekends via an 0800 number for \u00a35.99 a month on top of the ISP (Internet Service Provider) charges. We use BT Internet, but the Surftime package is now available from other suppliers too. Demon has just announced \"Premier Connect, our BT Surftime offering\". </p> <p>BT has also added an Anytime version of BT Surftime, which provides unmetered internet access 24 hours a day for \u00a319.99 a month. We had already signed up for Telewest's similar <a href=\"http://www.blueyonder.co.uk/dial/\">SurfUnlimited</a>, announced in February, because we already had cable TV and two Telewest phone lines. </p> <p>Telewest charges \u00a39.99 a month for SurfUnlimited, but this includes the subscription to Cable Internet, which was \u00a311.75 a month. I also have to pay for a Telewest line rental and make at least \u00a310 worth of voice calls a month. That is not a problem in our house. Other cable networks, including <a href=\"http://www.askntl.com\">NTL</a>, may have similar deals. </p> <p>The surprising thing about Surftime is not that it is cheaper but that it changes the way you use the net. Instead of planning surfing sessions in advance, and getting offline as quickly as possible, you start to look for things to download just so you can stay online. </p> <p>Because one drawback with most \"always on\" services is that they chuck you off if they don't detect any activity. In fact, BT chucks people off after two hours whether they are in the middle of a file download or not. </p> <p>I used to be a super-efficient surfer. I'd draw up a list of websites I wanted to visit and mail it to my Yahoo mailbox. Mailing a plain text message of correctly-formed addresses (including the http://) to Yahoo turns them into links. Then I'd go down the list, clicking the links to open all the pages I wanted. I would sometimes open 30 or 40 then close the connection to read them offline. (Yahoo doesn't load external pages in frames, so if you're still using Hotmail, switch.) </p> <p> When downloading files, I'd always use <a href=\"http://www.getright.com\">GetRight</a>. This is the best of several utilities that can pause and resume downloads - as long as the server supports resuming. With GetRight, I used to pause slow downloads and continue them later when the net was less congested. If the connection is dropped, GetRight can redial automatically and carry on. It is still a good idea to use GetRight with an unmetered connection, but it doesn't cost anything when downloads fail. </p> <p>An unmetered internet connection is also an open invitation to download short movies from <a href=\"http://www.atomfilms.com\">AtomFilms</a>, to listen to music at <a href=\"http://www.spinner.com\">www.spinner.com</a> and play games <a href=\"http://zone.msn.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">http://zone.msn.co.uk</a>. It lets you watch the world through a webcam at <a href=\"http://www.camcentral.com\">www.camcentral.com</a> or even pick up a Big Brother feed (use <a href=\"http://bbukhurl.real.com/ramhurl.ram?file=bbenc1.rmto6.rm\" target=\"_new\"> http://bbukhurl.real.com/ramhurl.ram?file=bbenc1.rmto6.rm</a> to avoid the Channel 4 website). When cost is not a barrier, neither is pointlessness. </p> <p>SurfUnlimited-type deals may not only change what you do online but when you do it. You don't have to wait for cheap rate phone charges to start; you don't have to wait for the homework rush to subside, usually at about 10pm. You may even be able to surf in the mornings: the net is quicker when the kids are at school and America is asleep. </p> <p>Some companies, such as LineOne, are retreating from unmetered services because they are uneconomic. The problem, said one spokesman, is that too many people stay logged on all the time. </p> <p>That's probably inevitable to begin with. Like a child in a chocolate factory, I logged 27 hours online during BT's first \"free\" weekend. But after a few months, the novelty wears off. And SurfUnlimited means I no longer feel obliged to do things for free on Sunday night when they are still free on Monday morning. </p> <p>In fact, for the first time in years, I can now get through most of a weekend without hitting the net at all. That's not what I expected from an \"always available\" service. Maybe there's hope for me yet.</p>",

(Yahoo doesn't load external pages in frames, so if you're still using Hotmail, switch.) When downloading files, I'd always use GetRight. This is the best of several utilities that can pause and resume downloads - as long as the server supports resuming. With GetRight, I used to pause slow downloads and continue them later when the net was less congested. If the connection is dropped, GetRight can redial automatically and carry on. It is still a good idea to use GetRight with an unmetered connection, but it doesn't cost anything when downloads fail. An unmetered internet connection is also an open invitation to download short movies from AtomFilms, to listen to music at www.spinner.com and play games http://zone.msn.co.uk. It lets you watch the world through a webcam at www.camcentral.com or even pick up a Big Brother feed (use http://bbukhurl.real.com/ramhurl.ram?file=bbenc1.rmto6.rm to avoid the Channel 4 website). When cost is not a barrier, neither is pointlessness. SurfUnlimited-type deals may not only change what you do online but when you do it. You don't have to wait for cheap rate phone charges to start; you don't have to wait for the homework rush to subside, usually at about 10pm. You may even be able to surf in the mornings: the net is quicker when the kids are at school and America is asleep. Some companies, such as LineOne, are retreating from unmetered services because they are uneconomic. The problem, said one spokesman, is that too many people stay logged on all the time. That's probably inevitable to begin with. Like a child in a chocolate factory, I logged 27 hours online during BT's first \"free\" weekend. But after a few months, the novelty wears off. And SurfUnlimited means I no longer feel obliged to do things for free on Sunday night when they are still free on Monday morning. In fact, for the first time in years, I can now get through most of a weekend without hitting the net at all. That's not what I expected from an \"always available\" service. Maybe there's hope for me yet.",

In May 1999 Faber and Faber had commissioned me to make a book-length study of Trier's Danish nouvelle vague . Shortly thereafter my friends Paula Jalfon and Colin MacCabe of Minerva Pictures suggested we make a companion documentary. Like many movie goers, I had been tickled by Trier's resolution to make simpler, more truthful films under a 10-point \"vow of chastity\". I'd admired the brass neck of Trier's youthful accomplice Thomas Vinterberg in explaining their strategy (\"We asked ourselves what we most hated about film today, then we drew up a list banning it all.\") And surely it was time somebody in European cinema revolted against the boring mediocrity of the Hollywood mainstream. But after the cheers and jeers for Vinterberg's Festen and Trier's The Idiots, I was being asked to hammer out the truth from the lies in this strange case. Was Dogme 95 more than just a twisted Scandinavian prank? </p> <p>The weirdness of film schedules meant that we began our investigation of this Danish phenomenon by hunting down a Frenchman in Midwest America. Jean-Marc Barr, director of the first non-Danish Dogme film, Lovers, was shooting his follow-up in the Illinois corn-belt, using digital video cameras no bigger than a man's fist. Our director Saul Metzstein was delighted to find that our DVC kit (the Sony PD100AP) was a fancier model than Barr's. But Jean-Marc was so sweet and passionate about the freedoms of working Dogme-style that he inspired us to try to emulate Trier's rules in our doc. So we solemnly swore: no lights, no props, no tripod, no superimposed titles, and no director's credit for Saul. We even improvised a few additional vows: I swore to wear at all times a bobble-hat bearing the legend \"Newcastle - Toon Army\" to prevent anybody taking me seriously. </p> <p>At last, in November 1999, we breached Denmark and travelled through the wooded outskirts of Copenhagen to Film City: formerly a military installation, now HQ of Dogme 95 operations. Trier's business partner Peter Aalbaek Jensen regaled us in his trophy-lined office, boasting of how he runs their company in a system of guerrilla \"cells\" impervious to CIA infiltration. \"Lars and I are old left-wingers,\" he grinned, \"and we wanted to use some of the precious skills that we learned in our communist youth.\" That night, our pulses raced as we met Thomas Vinterberg - prettier than most actors (though Saul's camera strove to find flaws in his physiognomy). </p> <p>Thomas was happy to explode the cabal-like myth of the Dogme Brotherhood: \"Really, we don't work that well together. We have a nice time, we drink a lot and yell at each other. But it just takes too long to decide anything.\" And Soren Kragh-Jacobsen (director of Dogme#3: Mifune) was refreshingly frank about the mounting critical disdain for the movement: \"It's the nature of man. You love something for nine months, then you start to talk shit about it.\" </p> <p>Sampling Copenhagen's nightlife, we had a fortuitous encounter with Porno-Lasse, Denmark's premier sexual performer, who loaned his skills for the infamous gangbang sequence in The Idiots. Alas, his contribution ended up on Trier's cutting-room floor; and we were unable to make room for him in our film either. Then again, Lasse fills more space than the average male. </p> <p>The next morning, we had our oddball audience with Trier. His cluttered office betrayed the trademark obsessions of a famous cineaste: rowing machine on the deck, scripts and DVDs (The Blair Witch Project) on the desk, and a framed portrait of Robert Baden-Powell. \"Any reason?\" I had to ask. \"Well, he's the man behind it all, isn't he?\" chuckled Lars. \"Old pervert...\" I should have headed for the long grass then. But once Lars laid off the leg-pulling, he was impressively thoughtful, comparing the D95 manifesto to certain buildings by Albert Speer, constructed with softer stones in strategic spots so as to crumble more elegantly into ruin. </p> <p>At those rare lucid moments, my respect for Dogme soared, as I think Saul's documentary conveys. Not a single person on screen seems to take anything seriously - except their work. And though Dogme is a game, it's played in deadly earnest: mock-solemn, but 100 per cent idealistic. This truth was evinced by our final witness, the anarchic Harmony Korine, director of US Dogme#1: Julien Donkey-Boy. </p> <p>\"I know I wouldn't be interested in Dogme if there was any irony attached to the vow of chastity\", asserted Harmony in his New York office. \"It's a very serious thing...\" </p> <p>He then spoiled the effect somewhat, by giggling. But as veteran students of the Dogme game, we chose to take his word. </p> <p>\u0095 The Name Of This Film Is Dogme 95, Saturday, 11.40pm, Channel 4</p>",

At those rare lucid moments, my respect for Dogme soared, as I think Saul's documentary conveys. Not a single person on screen seems to take anything seriously - except their work. And though Dogme is a game, it's played in deadly earnest: mock-solemn, but 100 per cent idealistic. This truth was evinced by our final witness, the anarchic Harmony Korine, director of US Dogme#1: Julien Donkey-Boy. \"I know I wouldn't be interested in Dogme if there was any irony attached to the vow of chastity\", asserted Harmony in his New York office. \"It's a very serious thing...\" He then spoiled the effect somewhat, by giggling. But as veteran students of the Dogme game, we chose to take his word. \u0095 The Name Of This Film Is Dogme 95, Saturday, 11.40pm, Channel 4",

A far cry from the $1.18 and 71p levels at the end of the first day of trading.</p> <p>Economists have found no shortage of explanations for the continued weakness of the single currency. Euroland's growth is picking up speed - helped, in part at least, by the euro's weakness - but it is still slower than that of the US. American interest rates are higher than in the eurozone.

It reflects, albeit in a lower key, the debate about the wisdom or otherwise of Britain signing up for the single currency. It has two aspects - one immediate, the other deeper-seated, but both potential negatives for the single currency's international standing.</p> <p>The first is the forthcoming referendum on whether Denmark should join the euro. The Danes have an interesting voting record on euro issues. Back in 1992, they voted against adopting the Maastricht treaty, which laid down the rules for single currency membership, by a narrow margin. The following year, having negotiated a series of opt-outs, they voted to accept Maastricht.</p> <p>This time, the opinion polls suggest the result will again be a close call. That means the vote will hardly provide a ringing endorsement of the euro and may well be a blow to its already dented credibility. So neither of the likely outcomes is going to be a \"buy\" signal for the single currency.</p> <p>The second relates to the institutional framework of euroland economic policy-making. The centrepiece is the European Central Bank. Its job is to maintain price stability. To that end, it sets not only interest rates but also the target range for inflation that it decides is consistent with price stability.</p> <p>The ECB is jealous of its independence, but there are those, especially in France, who are disturbed by the lack of political input into the economic decision-making process. Britain's euro-sceptics are not the only ones concerned by how much power resides in Frankfurt. Though the tension has been simmering since the ECB was set up - it was behind the row over who should be the first governor and for how long - the markets were given a smart reminder last month when the French finance minister, Laurent Fabius, suggested that euroland governments might, at some point, take on the job of setting the region's inflation target.</p> <p>Suffice it to say that the idea went down like a lead balloon in Frankfurt. But the incident highlighted a faultline in the euro policy structure. Not the sort of thing to have US mutual funds or Japanese insurers rushing to fill their port-folios with single currency assets. It could still be cheap on the beach next year.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mark.milner@theguardian.com\"> mark.milner@theguardian.com</a></p>",

The following year, having negotiated a series of opt-outs, they voted to accept Maastricht. This time, the opinion polls suggest the result will again be a close call. That means the vote will hardly provide a ringing endorsement of the euro and may well be a blow to its already dented credibility. So neither of the likely outcomes is going to be a \"buy\" signal for the single currency. The second relates to the institutional framework of euroland economic policy-making. The centrepiece is the European Central Bank. Its job is to maintain price stability. To that end, it sets not only interest rates but also the target range for inflation that it decides is consistent with price stability. The ECB is jealous of its independence, but there are those, especially in France, who are disturbed by the lack of political input into the economic decision-making process. Britain's euro-sceptics are not the only ones concerned by how much power resides in Frankfurt. Though the tension has been simmering since the ECB was set up - it was behind the row over who should be the first governor and for how long - the markets were given a smart reminder last month when the French finance minister, Laurent Fabius, suggested that euroland governments might, at some point, take on the job of setting the region's inflation target. Suffice it to say that the idea went down like a lead balloon in Frankfurt. But the incident highlighted a faultline in the euro policy structure. Not the sort of thing to have US mutual funds or Japanese insurers rushing to fill their port-folios with single currency assets. It could still be cheap on the beach next year. mark.milner@theguardian.com",

No doubt it seemed at the time like a routine operation to eliminate some potential opponents of the dictatorship.</p> <p>General Starck left Santiago by helicopter on September 30, heading first south, then turning towards the copper-rich north of the country. Everywhere Starck's helicopter landed, prisoners were taken out and murdered - four in Cauquenes, 12 in Valdivia, 15 in La Serena - until the final stop in Calama on October 19, where 26 political prisoners were killed. The Caravan had lasted 19 days. In total, 72 prisoners were dead.</p> <p>The episode was not the biggest in a series of death-dealing events initiated after that year's coup of September 11. But it has proved to be the one that has opened a crack in General Pinochet's immunity large enough for the astute and determined judge Juan Guzman to drive in a wedge. Guzman's case rests on a series of arguments that the Chilean Supreme Court has now not only accepted but reinforced. This week's decision is an important step forward in the painful process of putting Chile's legal system to rights after the systematic distortion of justice that took place under Pinochet's dictatorship.</p> <p>The first hurdle that Guzman had to overcome was the amnesty law that Pinochet had passed to insure himself and others against the possibility of ever facing justice. Decree law 2191, personally drafted by the then justice minister, Monica Madariaga, a relative of Pinochet's, was published on April 19 1978. It exculpates from criminal responsibility anyone who committed crimes, was an accomplice in crimes or covered up crimes between the day of the coup and March 10 1978. It is still in force.</p> <p>The list of crimes that the amnesty law pardons offers an illuminating glimpse of the methods employed by Pinochet's security forces: falsification and cheque swindles, for instance, are pardoned, along with all crimes committed by public employees through the exercise of their office, except for fraud. Homicide and physical injury are pardoned along with property damage, abortion, the abandonment of minors and, curiously, bigamy.</p> <p>Technically, the law applied to crimes committed by the regime's opponents as well as its servants and its stated purpose was to reunite a divided nation. Some 69 political prisoners were released under its provisions, but the impression of even-handedness was a fig leaf. Most of the beneficiaries were the members of the security services who had committed crimes against humanity. Such few human rights cases as had been accepted by the criminal courts were promptly handed over to the military system of justice - a network greatly expanded by Pinochet for the purpose - where the amnesty law was applied wholesale.</p> <p>The law was challenged, though, in 1986, when Ana Luisa Gonzalez filed a criminal suit for the premeditated abduction and homicide of her son, 17-year-old Jose Gregorio Saavedra Gonzalez. Jose had been president of his high school student body association and was in prison in Calama on October 19 1973, when General Starck's helicopter touched down.</p> <p>General Starck was an enthusiast for the coup - in fact, he persuaded an initially reluctant General Pinochet to lend it his support. He was an ideal man, therefore, to entrust with the Caravan of Death and had no scruples about ordering the 17-year-old to be murdered, along with 25 others. Like the families of 18 other victims of the Caravan of Death, Jose's family has never recovered his remains.</p> <p>Mrs Gonzalez argued in 1986 that the crime of abduction is expressly excluded from the amnesty law because, until the victim or his remains are found, the crime is ongoing. The military courts promptly claimed jurisdiction and applied the amnesty law. Mrs Gonzalez had not achieved justice, but the principle she had argued survived and has been used by Judge Guzman as a key element in his strategy.</p> <p>Judge Guzman's second stroke of luck was a matter of evidence. Like other mass murderers before him, Pinochet has not left a paper trail linking himself to his crimes. No written orders have come to light from Pinochet to his subordinates ordering them to carry out arbitrary detentions, torture and killings. But the events of the Caravan of Death do provide a direct link.</p> <p>The 72 victims who fell on each stop of General Starck's helicopter convoy were largely connected with the copper mines - trade unionists, mine workers, engineers, mine managers. Many had reported voluntarily to the military bases when they were called in after the coup to be relieved of their jobs, only to find themselves imprisoned. Chile's armed forces, it is easy to forget, were at the time seen as less prone to the overthrow of democracy than many others in Latin America. It had been a matter of some pride in Chile that democracy had deeper roots than elsewhere on the continent. It was a matter of pride, too, to many of the officers.</p> <p>So when General Starck arrived and ordered that prisoners be shot without trial, he occasionally encountered some resistance from constitutionally minded officers in charge of the jails. They demanded to know on whose orders such atrocities were to be committed. General Starck answered that he had the authority of the supreme commander, no less - thus supplying Judge Guzman with a vital link in the chain of evidence.</p> <p>Pinochet's next defence, his immunity as a self-appointed senator-for-life, was perhaps the gravest insult to Chile's still partial return to democracy, however much Chile's elected representatives might struggle to live with this stroke of realpolitik. Whatever the final outcome of Judge Guzman's case, the supreme court, by a majority of 14 to six, has restored both dignity and credibility to Chilean democracy and for that alone must be applauded.</p> <p>It remains to be seen how many heads of the Pinochet hydra still have life in them. It is still open for a military court to claim the case, but since the supreme court has ruled that the amnesty law does not apply, that option is neither as quick nor as convenient as it used to be.</p> <p>The head of the armed forces has been quick to express his support for Pinochet, but otherwise there is little the military is able - or is prepared - to do to affect the judicial process. The case will take its course. The mental health of the general must now be examined, though his family are presently refusing to permit what they term an \"indignity\". To that, Judge Guzman replies that nobody is above the law. Until this week in Chile, that principle was more dishonoured than respected. Today, at least it has a chance.</p>",

Sir David Ramsbotham said that vulnerable prisoners at Lindholme, in South Yorkshire, had been exposed to bullying and even the risk of suicide because of \"militant\" staff refusing to experiment with different rotas and increased patrols. In a strongly-worded report, noting dismal progress in carrying out recommendations made after his visit to Lindholme four years ago, Sir David accused the Prison Officers' Association of putting its own \"ease and comfort\" first. He said: \"I am well aware that there are two sides to every issue, but the POA at Lindholme has only itself to blame for its attitude being questioned, because of its long record of militancy.\" The attack brought an equally sharp reaction from the union. It described the criticisms as \"asinine\" and wholly adrift from realities at the grade C prison at a former RAF base on isolated moorland east of Doncaster. Ron Adams, vice chairman of the POA, described the comments made by Sir David, who is reluctantly standing down from his post later this year, as \"inaccurate, misleading and an affront\". Mr Adams claimed that working arrangements at Lindholme were sanctioned by the prison's management, which enjoyed a good working relationship with staff. \"The inferences made by Sir David that POA members at Lindholme would knowingly put inmates at risk are scandalous,\" he said. \"At prisons throughout the UK, including Lindholme, POA members put their own safety at risk to protect inmates. \"His comments are designed solely to catch headlines, and are not worthy of someone in such a responsible position.

The attack comes at a time when relations between the officers' union and the prison service agency management have reached a nadir, following the announcement of industrial action by staff over the proposed privatisation of Brixton jail. The prisons minister at the Home Office, Paul Boateng, rounded on the union last week after a report compared industrial relations in the service to the worst days of the British car industry in the 1960s. He said: \"The prison service cannot be some sort of Jurassic Park, some sort of lost world in which dinosaurs roam, while the rest of the world moves on and passes by.\"",

MPs are required to register full details of outside earnings for services linked to their position in Parliament, lodging written employment agreements for any activities such as speaking, TV appearances or newspaper columns which are \"frequent\" rather than \"occasional\". Mr Leslie's complaint to Ms Filkin revolves around allegations that Mr Portillo gave several after-dinner speeches to audiences of businessmen for fees of as much as \u00a35,000 a time. Mr Portillo could not be reached for comment last night, and a Conservative Party spokesman said that the party had no comment to make on the complaint. It comes hot on the heels of a complaint to Ms Filkin by Mr Portillo's frontbench colleague Angela Browning about Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy's earnings from after-dinner speaking. Ms Browning, shadow trade and industry secretary, described allegations that Mr Kennedy had not registered his earnings from this source as \"a matter of grave concern\". Asked about that complaint yesterday morning, Mr Kennedy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said that he was seeking clarification of what requirement there was to register fees for speaking. He added: \"I am very interested the Conservatives have chosen to try and make an issue of this. \"One assumes therefore there is no question of any senior parliamentary Conservative accepting the occasional outside speaking engagement.\"",

Few will recognise the flag or know anything about the country it represents. They will not know that it has been devastated by 10 years of civil war between clan warlords, and they will have no idea of the obstacles these seven athletes had to overcome to get there. The country they represent is the only one in the world without a government - stateless and ungoverned since 1991 - and its athletes will compete in memory of the hundreds of thousands of their fellow countrymen who have died in the ongoing conflict. \"The world has forgotten us and our suffering,\" said Abdullahi Turabi, secretary general of the Somali Olympic Committee (SOC). \"But by going to the Games we are asking them to remember us.

He is bursting with talent, but Somalia's ruinous state means that the SOC can offer him little more than moral support. He took up athletics just over a year ago, when a coach spotted him training for a football match and asked him to come back the following week and take part in a race. Abukar won the race and was selected to represent Somalia at the Pan-Arab Games in Jordan last year. But on the day of the marathon he was given a pair of ill-fitting sprinting spikes and was injured, though he does not blame it on the shoes. Because he had no access to doctors or physiotherapists, he had to pull out of the All Africa Games two months later.

But the team's achievement lies in getting there and flying the flag. \"Whatever they manage to achieve, to us they are the magnificent seven,\" Mr Turabi said proudly.",

Apart from the premature baldness, now resolved by his adoption of a menacing Grant Mitchell crop, his CV should be a spin doctor's dream. A \"normal\" middle-class family background, north of Watford too, a state school education, four As at A-level and straight into Oxford. There he both got a first and was president of the Union, a rare double. Thence into McKinsey's, the cult management consultancy which does not hire fools.</p> <p>Onwards and upwards until, at 36, already an ex-cabinet minister, young William becomes the youngest Tory leader since Pitt (who got the job in 1793 when he was 24). He was a William too, come to think of it, nerdy and a bit of a boozer. As Cecil Parkinson used to say: \"At every stage William's done better than Tony Blair.\" And yet he still seems to get the personal stuff horribly wrong.

Apart from the premature baldness, now resolved by his adoption of a menacing Grant Mitchell crop, his CV should be a spin doctor's dream. A \"normal\" middle-class family background, north of Watford too, a state school education, four As at A-level and straight into Oxford. There he both got a first and was president of the Union, a rare double. Thence into McKinsey's, the cult management consultancy which does not hire fools. Onwards and upwards until, at 36, already an ex-cabinet minister, young William becomes the youngest Tory leader since Pitt (who got the job in 1793 when he was 24). He was a William too, come to think of it, nerdy and a bit of a boozer. As Cecil Parkinson used to say: \"At every stage William's done better than Tony Blair.\" And yet he still seems to get the personal stuff horribly wrong.

A German paper claimed he was being guarded by a police detachment of 80.</p> <p>Baffled by the ritual of the Blairs' reluctant family photocall at the Villa Cusona, near San Gimignano, European papers questioned the princely cost. One pointed out that Mr Blair required 15 armour-plated cars, when his Italian counterpart, holidaying elsewhere in Tuscany, made do with one such vehicle.</p> <p>Altogether, it was not a good press day for Mr Blair. La Nazione, in Tuscany, suggested Italians were lucky not to have to witness the security operation required to preserve the family's privacy, and the \"almost sadistic iciness\" shown to the British press pack.</p> <p>Magi Cleaver, a Downing Street press officer, was mocked as an ill-humoured watchdog. Branding her \"Sergeant Magi\", La Nazione quoted her as saying: \"Only TV operators and photographers can go in. You can only stay a few minutes, you will be 20 yards away and remain in silence. You must not disturb the sleep of little Leo. If he cries we will stop it.\"</p> <p>Another Tuscan newspaper, Corriere divi Siena, said the photocall's three-minute stony silence, from which reporters were banned without leave to appeal, was a \"dumb show\" that left a bitter taste in the mouth. The event, cancelled following the Blairs' protests over publication of photographs of the christening of baby Leo, was reinstated after the intervention of the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, Lord Wakeham.</p> <p>Unlike previous years, Italy's national newspapers have in the main ignored the guests of Prince Girolamo Strozzi, owner of the 50-room renaissance villa outside San Gimignano. There have been no new accusations of Blair freeloading for having accepted the prince's hospitality.</p> <p>Local newspapers also played down last week's report in a British daily that San Gimignano's mayor, Marco Lisi, was still furious at Mr Blair's failure to meet him last summer. Amends have been made, and after the two had met, Mr Lisi dripped superlatives in yesterday's La Nazione.</p> <p>Italian criticism found an echo in the German daily Die Welt: \"The premier's stay in Tuscany is keeping the Italian security services pretty busy. Forty officers have been quartered in a nearby farmhouse, 20 police and 20 Carabinieri. For the family, a further personal detachment of 20 has been deployed. In addition, there are two Scotland Yard officers and 12 police consultants accompanying Mr Blair.\"</p> <p>A dog team had been brought in, along with a helicopter to watch from above, Die Welt reported. The premier and his family also had 15 armour-plated cars at their disposal, \"more extravagant than his Italian counterpart, Giuliano Amato, who, on his holidays in Ansedonia [also in Tuscany] has only 10 escorts and one armour-plated car\".</p> <p>Last night a Downing Street spokeswoman said: \"The numbers of Italian police and armour-plated cars are a matter for the Italian authorities; we have not requested any.\"</p> <p>The French media were uninterested, preoccupied by their own leaders' holidays. Last week the professorial prime minister, Lionel Jospin, and his wife were heading lfor their usual three weeks on the chic but windswept Isle de R\u00e9, off La Rochelle.</p> <p>Jacques Chirac, the president, flew to his customary summer hideout, a luxury hotel in Mauritius. Unfortunately, a team from Paris Match preceded him, allowing the magazine to publish a sensational feature: \"Happy Holidays, Mr President.\"</p> <p>It revealed the presidential suite (two bedrooms, drawing room, terrace with sea view) at the Royal Palm hotel cost \u00a32,190 a day, meaning the presidential couple's three weeks would cost the state some \u00a346,000.</p> <p>Mr Jospin told Le Monde he would be \"swimming, playing tennis, walking and talking with friends\", but Paris Match quoted a Royal Palm shopkeeper saying the Chiracs had already spent \u00a340,000 on three silk rugs. It also spoke to the family masseuse, Maureen (\"the woman who has seen the president naked\"), and found a beach merchant to proclaim: \"The Chiracs are nice, not snobbish at all. He's rich. He has lots of big banknotes in his pocket, and his wife never even tries to bargain.\"</p> <p>An incensed Mr Chirac is reported to have himself telephoned the editor of Paris Match. The magazine apologised the next day for \"a number of inaccuracies\", but tantalisingly, it declined to say what exactly they were.</p>",

One pointed out that Mr Blair required 15 armour-plated cars, when his Italian counterpart, holidaying elsewhere in Tuscany, made do with one such vehicle. Altogether, it was not a good press day for Mr Blair. La Nazione, in Tuscany, suggested Italians were lucky not to have to witness the security operation required to preserve the family's privacy, and the \"almost sadistic iciness\" shown to the British press pack. Magi Cleaver, a Downing Street press officer, was mocked as an ill-humoured watchdog. Branding her \"Sergeant Magi\", La Nazione quoted her as saying: \"Only TV operators and photographers can go in. You can only stay a few minutes, you will be 20 yards away and remain in silence. You must not disturb the sleep of little Leo. If he cries we will stop it.\" Another Tuscan newspaper, Corriere divi Siena, said the photocall's three-minute stony silence, from which reporters were banned without leave to appeal, was a \"dumb show\" that left a bitter taste in the mouth. The event, cancelled following the Blairs' protests over publication of photographs of the christening of baby Leo, was reinstated after the intervention of the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, Lord Wakeham. Unlike previous years, Italy's national newspapers have in the main ignored the guests of Prince Girolamo Strozzi, owner of the 50-room renaissance villa outside San Gimignano. There have been no new accusations of Blair freeloading for having accepted the prince's hospitality. Local newspapers also played down last week's report in a British daily that San Gimignano's mayor, Marco Lisi, was still furious at Mr Blair's failure to meet him last summer. Amends have been made, and after the two had met, Mr Lisi dripped superlatives in yesterday's La Nazione. Italian criticism found an echo in the German daily Die Welt: \"The premier's stay in Tuscany is keeping the Italian security services pretty busy. Forty officers have been quartered in a nearby farmhouse, 20 police and 20 Carabinieri. For the family, a further personal detachment of 20 has been deployed. In addition, there are two Scotland Yard officers and 12 police consultants accompanying Mr Blair.\" A dog team had been brought in, along with a helicopter to watch from above, Die Welt reported. The premier and his family also had 15 armour-plated cars at their disposal, \"more extravagant than his Italian counterpart, Giuliano Amato, who, on his holidays in Ansedonia [also in Tuscany] has only 10 escorts and one armour-plated car\". Last night a Downing Street spokeswoman said: \"The numbers of Italian police and armour-plated cars are a matter for the Italian authorities; we have not requested any.\" The French media were uninterested, preoccupied by their own leaders' holidays. Last week the professorial prime minister, Lionel Jospin, and his wife were heading lfor their usual three weeks on the chic but windswept Isle de R\u00e9, off La Rochelle. Jacques Chirac, the president, flew to his customary summer hideout, a luxury hotel in Mauritius. Unfortunately, a team from Paris Match preceded him, allowing the magazine to publish a sensational feature: \"Happy Holidays, Mr President.\" It revealed the presidential suite (two bedrooms, drawing room, terrace with sea view) at the Royal Palm hotel cost \u00a32,190 a day, meaning the presidential couple's three weeks would cost the state some \u00a346,000. Mr Jospin told Le Monde he would be \"swimming, playing tennis, walking and talking with friends\", but Paris Match quoted a Royal Palm shopkeeper saying the Chiracs had already spent \u00a340,000 on three silk rugs. It also spoke to the family masseuse, Maureen (\"the woman who has seen the president naked\"), and found a beach merchant to proclaim: \"The Chiracs are nice, not snobbish at all. He's rich. He has lots of big banknotes in his pocket, and his wife never even tries to bargain.\" An incensed Mr Chirac is reported to have himself telephoned the editor of Paris Match. The magazine apologised the next day for \"a number of inaccuracies\", but tantalisingly, it declined to say what exactly they were.",

Yesterday the increasingly violent campaign, which has seen cars and houses firebombed and residents stoned, took a new twist as police revealed that four innocent families had fled the Paulsgrove estate and were in hiding. The families are victims of a witch hunt in which people have taken it upon themselves to decide who is a paedophile, often based on rumour and hearsay.</p> <p>As he surveyed the rally on the village green in front of his church, Father Gary Waddington, vicar of St Michael's and All Angels, said: \"This estate has been like Bosnia in the last week.

These campaigners supposedly have a list of 20 names of people they say have committed crimes against children.

The message on the placard read: \"Paedophiles - don't house them, hang them.\" Nearby a girl aged three, looking similarly confused, held a sign as if she was supporting her local village fete. It read: \"Kill paedophiles.\" The young, unaware children are at the centre of a campaign to hunt down and oust suspected paedophiles from their homes on a Portsmouth housing estate. Yesterday the increasingly violent campaign, which has seen cars and houses firebombed and residents stoned, took a new twist as police revealed that four innocent families had fled the Paulsgrove estate and were in hiding. The families are victims of a witch hunt in which people have taken it upon themselves to decide who is a paedophile, often based on rumour and hearsay. As he surveyed the rally on the village green in front of his church, Father Gary Waddington, vicar of St Michael's and All Angels, said: \"This estate has been like Bosnia in the last week. The only difference is that we don't have ethnic cleansing here. It is social cleansing. These campaigners supposedly have a list of 20 names of people they say have committed crimes against children. But no one knows where this list comes from, who has written it or what evidence it is based on. Now four innocent families are in hiding because of it.\" Fr Waddington said he preaches the message love thy neighbour in his Sunday services but, looking at the children waving hate filled banners in front of his church, he wonders how the message got so badly lost. \"Some of the residents may well be raising legitimate concerns but this protest is doing nothing more than spreading fear and bigotry.\" The leaders of the campaign, who have vowed they will not end their protest until all paedophiles are driven from their estate, last night appeared unrepentant that innocent families had been driven from their homes.

Mr Chavez is touring Opec countries handing out invitations to Caracas next month for what he hopes will be the organisation's first heads-of-state summit for 25 years. He has already visited Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar. Under American pressure, the Saudis have been seeking to increase Opec oil-production quotas, to reduce prices from their peak of around $30 (\u00a320) a barrel. But Venezuela - which at 3.1m barrels a day is Latin America's largest producer - is almost totally dependent on oil revenue, and each $1 drop in oil prices costs it about $1bn (\u00a3665m) a year. Mr Chavez argues that the real issue is not high prices, but fair prices. \"We understand that they [consumers] start to feel uneasy when crude oil prices reach $30 a barrel, but they can imagine how it must have been for us when it fell to $8,\" he said recently. Last month, in a presidential election which the US described as free and fair, Mr Chavez was re-elected with around 60% of the vote. He is a charismatic, populist leader who, despite high oil prices, has failed to deliver economically. During the election, he promised an \"economic revolution\" to get the economy back on its feet and give the poor - his main source of support - a larger share in oil-generated profits. Hugo Chavez Age 46 President since 1998 Former paratrooper colonel who led a failed coup attempt in1992. Spent two years in prison before being pardoned. A democratically elected strongmen and populist leader, considered Latin America's greatest orator after Fidel Castro. Regarded with suspicion by the US because of his leftwing policies Has close links with Cuba and once described Libya as 'a model of participatory democracy'. Saddam Hussein Age 63 President since 1979 Became lieutenant-general in 1976, field marshal in 1979 Led Iraq through eight-year war against Iran, with support from US and several Arab states. Outlawed in 1990 following invasion of Kuwait Survives through brutality more than popularity, but has turned western onslaughts - bombing, sanctions, etc - to his political advantage.",

In 20 years there has been one female winner, 1995's Jenny Eclair, and none who is black or brown. With a few exceptions, such as the League of Gentlemen in 1999, recent victors have been white boys telling jokes into a mic. </p> <p>\"We reflect what's there,\" sighs the award's organiser, Nica Burns, who has obviously heard this charge before. \"We're not seeking to change the nature of comedy. We reflect what's happening on the fringe.\" </p> <p>This year, it's true, there are only two or three Asian comedians performing at the festival. But given that the Perrier dominates comedy on the fringe, it can't disclaim all responsibility for the acts that it attracts. </p> <p>In part, the Perrier has been a victim of its own success. The competition has had a reputation for picking stars since the very first award in 1981, which went to a bunch of fresh-faced undergraduates from Cambridge University. Among them were Emma Thompson, Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. Famous winners since have included Theatre de Complicite, Jeremy Hardy, Sean Hughes, Frank Skinner, Steve Coogan and Dylan Moran. There is scarcely a significant British comic who does not have at least a nomination to his or her name. </p> <p>And the rewards can be great. Not the rather miserly cash prize of \u00a35,000, but what comes with it. Almost every winner from the past decade now has a high TV profile. Last year's victor, Al Murray, was quickly snapped up by Sky for a reputed \u00a33m. The problem, say critics, is that the Perrier's reputation as a feeder for TV corrupts the festival's output, and in turn diminishes its status. </p> <p>\"The Perrier has become distorted so badly over the years. It has allowed itself to become a business tool for the British light entertainment industry,\" says Tommy Shepherd, director of Edinburgh's Stand comedy venue. \"No one really accords it much artistic credibility any more.\" He refrains from blaming the jury, which is largely made up of journalists and other media types. </p> <p>The ideal winner of the Perrier and the other comedy awards at Edinburgh, is, he says, \"a 24-year-old with a regional accent, but clear enough to be understood, who's a bit of a lad, and not quite good looking enough to be in a boy band. There has been a conspicuous commercialisation.\" </p> <p>The high stakes were well illustrated by last year's battle over Al Murray, \"the Pub Landlord\". Murray was first excluded from the competition on the grounds that he was already \"too successful\" (ie, playing venues that were deemed too big), then reinstated after protests from his famously robust agents, Avalon. Just to make sure there were there no more ructions, a lawyer was appointed to sit as an independent observer during the jury's deliberations. Murray went on to win. </p> <p>Simon Fanshawe, 1989's winner, believes the complaints about the fringe are exaggerated. \"Of course there's an end of it that's connected to TV,\" he concedes. \"But if you look at the comedy roster, it's enormous. It's still the place where people experiment, find ways of doing something different.\" </p> <p>Still, small performers say that they have been squeezed out of the award by the emphasis on finding TV's next big thing. Earl Okin, whose unbroken 18-year run at the fringe has earned him a place in the Guinness Book of Records, resigned from the fringe committee last month in protest at what he says is now a two-tier festival. Performers backed by the big London promoters - those, in other words, who can afford to book a run at either the Gilded Balloon, the Pleasance or the Assembly Rooms - thrive, while smaller outfits complain that they struggle to get noticed by punters and the awards committee alike. </p> <p>\"The main problem,\" says Okin, \"is that if you have a festival where everything is tacitly geared towards the style of comedy on the London circuit, first of all you turn a fringe festival into a trade fair, and secondly you narrow down the styles of comedy open to the public.\" </p> <p>\"I don't understand when people criticise [the fringe] as a trade fair,\" says Burns, who is also production director for West End theatre owners Stoll Moss. \"I say, what a great way to have a trade fair. In Edinburgh I can go out for a week as a professional looking for talent in writing and in acting, and I can see 30 shows. How could I do that in my working week?\" </p> <p>She says she knows of one Channel 4 commissioning editor who saw 92 shows last year. \"That's really giving everyone a go at the talent bite. All that people are asking for is a chance for their work to be seen. Edinburgh provides that.\" </p> <p>The Perrier has always tried to keep pace with the comedy scene that it helped create. A \"best newcomer\" gong was introduced in 1992 expressly to recognise the talents of Harry Hill, who was felt not to be experienced enough for the main award. But perhaps now the Perrier has now dropped too far behind the times. \"Comedy at grassroots level is developing much faster than the award reflects,\" says comedian Stewart Lee. \"One of the great things about the comedy scene is that it's fragmenting in the way that it was 20 years ago, from what had become a new establishment of something not unlike 21st-century working-men's clubs with a bit of smut thrown in. You can't really compare different shows any more.\" </p> <p>The award, Lee says, inevitably has a limiting, conservative influence on the festival's comedy programme. \"I think the Perrier is one of the things that makes the festival worse than it would otherwise be.

How could I do that in my working week?\" She says she knows of one Channel 4 commissioning editor who saw 92 shows last year. \"That's really giving everyone a go at the talent bite. All that people are asking for is a chance for their work to be seen. Edinburgh provides that.\" The Perrier has always tried to keep pace with the comedy scene that it helped create. A \"best newcomer\" gong was introduced in 1992 expressly to recognise the talents of Harry Hill, who was felt not to be experienced enough for the main award. But perhaps now the Perrier has now dropped too far behind the times. \"Comedy at grassroots level is developing much faster than the award reflects,\" says comedian Stewart Lee. \"One of the great things about the comedy scene is that it's fragmenting in the way that it was 20 years ago, from what had become a new establishment of something not unlike 21st-century working-men's clubs with a bit of smut thrown in. You can't really compare different shows any more.\" The award, Lee says, inevitably has a limiting, conservative influence on the festival's comedy programme. \"I think the Perrier is one of the things that makes the festival worse than it would otherwise be. It narrows it into a little race.\" Past winners 1981 Cambridge Footlights 1982 Writers Inc 1983 Los Trios Ringbarkus 1984 The Brass Band 1985 Theatre de Complicite 1986 Ben Keaton 1987 Brown Blues 1988 Jeremy Hardy 1989 Simon Fanshawe 1990 Sean Hughes 1991 Frank Skinner 1992 Steve Coogan 1993 Lee Evans 1994 Lano and Woodley 1995 Jenny Eclair 1996 Dylan Moran 1997 The League of Gentlemen 1998 Tommy Tiernan 1999 Al Murray, the Pub Landlord",

Mr Berezovsky, a key Kremlin insider who was a close associate of President Boris Yeltsin and who was highly instrumental in securing the presidency for Mr Putin, fiercely criticised Russia's war in Chechnya and Mr Putin's current campaign to recentralise power. He recently resigned his seat in parliament in protest at Mr Putin's policies and yesterday unveiled plans to fill the opposition vacuum created by Mr Putin's increasing domination of Russia's political scene. His announcement coincided with the publication of a liberal manifesto signed by prominent figures from politics, the media, and the arts warning of Mr Putin's creeping authoritarian tendencies. The signatories included the novelist Vasili Aksenov, the theatre director Yuri Lyubimov, and the liberal Alexander Yakovlev, who as the architect of Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost policies played a huge role in undermining the Soviet communist dictatorship. At his news conference, Mr Berezovsky said that while Mr Putin has not abolished democratic freedoms in Russia, he has created the legal and political foundation for autocratic rule. \"It's not effectively an authoritarian regime yet, but formally it's already authoritarian,\" he said. The notoriously manipulative Mr Berezovsky has turned against Mr Putin in recent months, attacking the president's policies on Chechnya, on Russia's 89 regions, on the media and on business leaders - the infamous oligarchs of which he is one of the leaders. Apart from his extensive oil and car industry interests, Mr Berezovsky controls the main state television channel which he used ruthlessly last year to carry Mr Putin into the Kremlin. But he is now under pressure from the Putin camp to surrender control of the television channel and Putin aides are confident that a deal will soon be struck.

      "body": "<p> 'I think Britain is very good at highlighting human-rights issues in other countries, but when it comes to just outside Oxford, everyone gets a little bit squeamish,\" says Kay Adshead, writer of The Bogus Woman. The play, which is being staged at the Edinburgh's Traverse, chronicles the experiences of an African journalist seeking refuge in Britain from atrocity at home. Adshead had been involved in the Campaign to Close Campsfield, the notorious detention centre in Oxfordshire, and makes no bones about views on Britain's attitude to asylum seekers. \"I hope I've written a consciousness-raising piece of work which has the maximum impact,\" she says. \"I didn't want to pretend there was any impartiality about it. I wanted the whole story to be totally subjective. Everybody else is giving their opinions on asylum seekers - you can't open a paper without seeing them - but I wanted this to be my character's point of view.\" </p> <p>The Guardian's Michael Billington has called the play \"a powerful, passionate, committed piece of theatre that, if seen widely enough, might change hearts and minds. The Bogus Woman does seem to be a little pocket of old-style 70s commitment in the otherwise soft environment of the Edinburgh festival. Having cut her teeth as a performer in the 70s, when \"theatre belonged to communities and could be about the things that affected communities\", Adshead finds it \"strange that theatre stopped being like that\". </p> <p>She began writing in the 80s after working in improvised theatre with directors such as Mike Leigh. \"The more devised work I did, and the more I realised that I was using the stuff of my own life, the more I thought: I can do this myself.\" She duly did so, and the result, a proto-Band of Gold prostitution drama, Thatcher's Women, was produced to acclaim by Paines Plough in 1987. </p> <p>In 1996, The Red Room, who are producing The Bogus Woman, teamed up with Adshead to stage her Royal Court-commissioned millennial political epic, Bacillus. Both company and writer believe in theatre as a forum for social debate, but \"even though everyone was saying they wanted a state-of-the-nation play, nobody wanted to stage Bacillus,\" says Adshead. </p> <p>The Bogus Woman began life as a short play in a season of political work at BAC, south London, and Adshead starred in Victoria Wood's Dinnerladies while she developed the work further. </p> <p>She is unequivocal about the climate that produced the government's Asylum and Immigration Act, which all but criminalises the seeking of asylum and stigmatises those who do gain entry. \"It annoys me that we feel we have a monopoly on prosperity,\" she says. \"And anyway, what's wrong with people trying to look for a better life? It doesn't take a great deal of imagination, surely, to get behind that idea. People say we live in a global world only when it suits them but, of course, the very parties most keen on global capitalism get decidedly protectionist when it is people rather than money that is on the move.\" </p> <p>The nameless heroine of Adshead's play is banged up in Campsfield Detention Centre and becomes involved in the protests that led to the trial of the Campsfield Nine, the group of refugees who were accused and acquitted of rioting at the centre in 1997. In researching the play, Adshead got to know one of the nine, who became her primary source for the description of a system that \"treats all these people as miscreants and wrong-doers\". The play is a synthesis of several first-person accounts, \"more shocking than some,\" says Adshead, \"and less shocking than others\". </p> <p>Eager to distinguish her play from documentary, Adshead even wrote the play in verse. But hard facts are never far beneath the surface in a work that vividly dramatises not only the unrest at Campsfield but the thuggish and often racist backlash that followed. The protagonist describes in harrowing terms the centre's \"prison for profit\" regime, whose wardens are \"hired to brutalise in 12-hour shifts at \u00a34 an hour\". </p> <p>If all this leads you to imagine Adshead as some kind of firebrand, you'll have to think again. Her crusade is dignified by the fact that, as she says, \"I'm not a militant or a far-left person.\"On the contrary, she projects the mumsy air of a well-meaning but faintly naive woman who has suddenly discovered something distasteful happening in her own back yard. When she began to research The Bogus Woman, she recalls, \"I was just gobsmacked. I assumed, in my British liberal way, that people were nice to asylum-seekers. I find it really shocking.\" </p> <p>Her conversation deconstructs Britain's treatment of refugees not from an ideological or analytical perspective, as we might expect from a \"political\" writer, but from one of compassion. Poring over Refugee Council records of asylum seekers' plights almost put her off writing the play, she says. \"I've not got a very strong stomach and I found them terribly upsetting. </p> <p>\"I don't think this is a political thing. I think it's a moral and compassionate issue. When people are vulnerable, you give them the benefit of the doubt, until otherwise proved. That's just being kind.\" Far from suggesting political solutions to what the tabloids call Britain's \"deluge\" of illegal immigrants, Adshead reiterates her sense that \"I don't think there are goodies and baddies - I think there are individual cases, and we should look at every case with a clear eye.\" </p> <p>The Bogus Woman is empty of dogma and reveals remorselessly the human consequences of a system of which, Adshead believes, this country should be ashamed. One of the official persecutors in the play intones: \"I would suggest that your whole story - the killing of your family; the rape - is nothing but a pack of well-schemed lies.\" To Adshead, it is the host, and not the visitor, who is guilty of the greatest self-deception.</p> <p>\u0095 The Bogus Woman is at the Traverse till August 13.

Yesterday coastguards groaned as Mr Abbott, 56, an unemployed painter and decorator who hotly denies using an AA road atlas as a navigation aid, vowed to sail again after being rescued from the Irish sea for the sixth time. He was towed into harbour on Anglesey on Tuesday after losing his way at night during a voyage from Dublin. It took more than an hour to find him. Mr Abbott rejected claims that he is reckless, describing himself as careful but unlucky. He stayed in harbour after coastguard warnings of rough seas and force six winds but plans to set sail soon for Rhyl. \"I'm not a bad seaman,\" he said. \"After all, I've sailed around Ireland. The only reason Moelfre lifeboat was called to get me into Amlwch harbour was because it was dark and some of the islands I passed north of Anglesey didn't have lights on.\" Mr Abbott bought his 24ft yacht - named Plus Vat in protest at the tax that was added to the boat's purchase price - 18 years ago and taught himself navigation skills. Yesterday he claimed he had charts for the Irish sea and Irish inlets. \"I also have a map of Europe from a newspaper but it isn't very detailed,\" he said. \"My boat is seaworthy but if you come to a point in the dark and it isn't easy to see your way, then you need help.

The biggest share - \u00a36m - of a national lottery programme for urban parks, announced yesterday, has gone to the Swiss bridge, Victorian kiosk and other features of Birkenhead Park. The funding, part of a \u00a314m handout which will also regenerate parks in Leeds, Rochdale and Reading, completes a \u00a310m package for the acres by the river Mersey that claim to be the oldest municipal park in the world. Birkenhead is the only Grade I listed municipal park in Britain but has suffered from underfunding, neglect and vandalism. Mike Garbutt of the Wirral ranger service, who put together the rescue package, said: \"What we want to do is reinstate its horticultural value and bring back the colours and smells they enjoyed in Victorian times.\" The scheme will re-landscape the approach to the park, provide new railings and stone piers, clean up the main lake and its Swiss bridge and provide a \u00a31m visitors' centre. The park will be advertised internationally, with a focus on New York, to increase tourism to the area. Other grants from the heritage lottery fund will revive Roundhay and Kirkstall Abbey parks in Leeds and help the restoration of the SS Great Britain and the Bristol dockyard where the ship, once the largest in the world, is berthed. Birkenhead Park was designed by the garden architect James Paxton, whose work inspired Calvert Vaux, the British-born designer who laid out Central Park with the American writer Frederick Law Olmsted after winning a competition in 1857.",

      "bodyText": "A rapist with an obsession for knives and guns was last night on the run after being convicted of a series of sex attacks across Britain. Trevor Masters, 48, was on conditional bail when he disappeared from a Cardiff guest house on Monday as a crown court jury considered 14 verdicts over his attacks on four victims. A news blackout imposed by Judge John Griffith Williams QC to prevent the jury being prejudiced by Masters' escape was yesterday lifted after nine guilty verdicts for rape, sex assaults and actual bodily harm were returned. Police in south Wales warned women about the 6ft fugitive described as \"dangerous but charming\" and capable of physical and sexual brutality. The force refused to comment on why Masters had been granted bail while facing such serious charges. Detective Constable Martyn Edwards, of Gwent police, who investigated the case, described Masters as a womaniser and a charmer: \"He is capable of befriending a woman and then abusing her. He is physically and sexually brutal.\" Parkkeeper Masters had an \"an unhealthy obsession with weapons such as knives and bayonets\", DC Edwards said, and though police had seized his firearms, he had held them illegally in the past. A warrant was issued for his arrest and an all ports alert was sent out by police after he \"absconded\", but it was feared he may have changed his appearance. Masters was understood to have fled after hearing the evidence weigh against him. Prosecutor Martin Farmer QC told the court how his first victim, then 26, met Masters in Cornwall. He later raped her in Redditch, Worcestershire, when he was a farm worker. Masters was also accused of tying one victim to a four-poster bed, threatening another with a gun and holding another down with a weight-lifting bar.

He was also convicted of an indecent assault on a woman, now 27, when she was under the age of 16. The jury failed to reach a verdict on another charge of indecent assault on her. Masters was found not guilty of two rapes and two serious sexual offences against a woman he met in Blaenavon when she was 28. During the three-week trial he denied carrying out attacks on the women and young girls over a 20-year period. Masters is understood to originally come from Redditch where he still has family ties, as well as numerous contacts in Britain and abroad, including Cornwall, Gwent, Shropshire and Herefordshire and France. He is described as athletic, around 6ft, with long, brown hair that can be tied back in a ponytail and he had a beard.",

Now the practice seems to have spread to the arts. The actors of Americana Absurdum were overheard chanting this refrain before going on stage: \"We're Americans and we're gonna sell this show. Sell! Sell! Sell!\" If they don't, they'll be back in their old jobs as used-car salesmen by the end of the month. </p> <p>\u0095 Spare a thought for rookie comic Chris Ozog, who is appearing at the Stand. This is the morning he gets his exam results. Chris is 16 and, as far as we are aware, the youngest stand-up on the fringe this year. Maths was \"a bastard\", apparently, but he's still hoping for the odd A. He isn't sure if he'll mention the results on stage, but admits that a spectacular failure would probably be the best result for comedy purposes. \"If I said I did really well, no one would believe me anyway,\" he adds. </p> <p>\u0095 Scotland is this year's hot spot for location-hungry Bollywood movies, and at least two crews are expected in Edinburgh next week to capture the festival atmosphere in glorious Technicolor. One has already asked to film a rally of 4,000 pipers, but with only about an hour's notice the local film office had to politely decline. \"They said there would be a disturbance,\" confirms Harjinder Dhami, location manager on a film called Love, Love and More Love. \"But the crew all knew about the Edinburgh festival and they really wanted to come here.\" Don't be surprised if you see a couple of Indian actors lip-synching their way down Princes Street. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:guardiary@excite.com\">guardiary@excite.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 The Kiwi rugby team have their haka, and nearer to home, in Glasgow, Celtic players have taken to psyching themselves up with a pre-match huddle. Now the practice seems to have spread to the arts. The actors of Americana Absurdum were overheard chanting this refrain before going on stage: \"We're Americans and we're gonna sell this show. Sell! Sell! Sell!\" If they don't, they'll be back in their old jobs as used-car salesmen by the end of the month. \u0095 Spare a thought for rookie comic Chris Ozog, who is appearing at the Stand. This is the morning he gets his exam results. Chris is 16 and, as far as we are aware, the youngest stand-up on the fringe this year. Maths was \"a bastard\", apparently, but he's still hoping for the odd A. He isn't sure if he'll mention the results on stage, but admits that a spectacular failure would probably be the best result for comedy purposes. \"If I said I did really well, no one would believe me anyway,\" he adds. \u0095 Scotland is this year's hot spot for location-hungry Bollywood movies, and at least two crews are expected in Edinburgh next week to capture the festival atmosphere in glorious Technicolor. One has already asked to film a rally of 4,000 pipers, but with only about an hour's notice the local film office had to politely decline. \"They said there would be a disturbance,\" confirms Harjinder Dhami, location manager on a film called Love, Love and More Love. \"But the crew all knew about the Edinburgh festival and they really wanted to come here.\" Don't be surprised if you see a couple of Indian actors lip-synching their way down Princes Street. guardiary@excite.com",

      "bodyText": "It was a scandal that rocked the nation: an aristocratic beauty was photographed performing fellatio on a lover, while shots of another man gratifying himself were unearthed in her boudoir. The sexually explicit Polaroid snaps proved central in the 1963 divorce of the Duke and Duchess of Argyll, and became part of a government investigation. The duchess's reputation was ruined, but her lover escaped blameless, his identity preserved for almost 40 years by the camera cutting him off at the neck. Tonight, the mystery of the \"headless man\" - or rather headless men - is resolved for the first time, with new evidence identifying not one, but two, lovers. The man in the more notorious shot is unveiled as Duncan Sandys, then a cabinet minister, and his masturbating rival as Douglas Fairbanks Jr, the Hollywood legend who dallied with Marlene Dietrich and married Joan Crawford. The two men's identities are revealed in a Channel 4 documentary to be shown tonight, Secret History: The Duchess and the Headless Man, which draws on the memories of the duchess's confidante, who identifies Sandys, and previously unpublished evidence gathered by the nation's then most senior law lord, Lord Denning. This formed part of his inquiry into security risks following the resignation of the then secretary of state for war, John Profumo. Sandys's identity is \"conclusively proved\", the documentary makers believe, by the duchess's claim that the only Polaroid camera in the country at the time had been lent to the Ministry of Defence, where Sandys was a minister. Fairbanks is nailed by his handwriting. The Argyll case, heard in March 1963 - the same month John Profumo lied to the Commons about his relationship Christine Keeler - was the longest and most sensational divorce to occur in Britain. Margaret Argyll, the only child of a self-made Scottish millionaire, was a society beauty who her husband alleged had slept with 88 men, including two cabinet ministers and three royals. Profumo resigned in early June but, before the month was out, the precarious Macmillan government was rocked by another threat, and looked in danger of being toppled. At a stormy cabinet meeting on June 20, Sandys, the son-in-law of Winston Churchill, confessed he was rumoured to be the person in the erotic shots, which, at that time, were presumed to be of one man. He offered to resign but Macmillan managed to dissuade him by ensuring Lord Denning, who had been commissioned to investigate the Profumo scandal, also investigated the identity of the headless lover. For this Denning, the master of the rolls, had a plan. On the four shots of the man in different states of arousal were handwritten captions: \"before\", \"thinking of you\", \"during - oh\", and \"finished\".

      "byline": "David Rowley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>You could be forgiven for thinking that <a href=\"http://www.qxl.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">QXL</a> was the UK's biggest internet auction site considering all the publicity it has received. However, largely through word of mouse, this position looks likely to belong to <a href=\"http://www.eBay.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">eBay.co.uk</a>, the recently opened branch of ebay.com. </p> <p>EBay UK had quietly built up to 127,000 users by the end of March, and is confident this figure will double by the end of the year. What is remarkable is that while QXL built up its user base through a constant stream of media coverage, eBay.co.uk, echoing its US parent site, has not yet resorted to large advertising campaigns. </p> <p>Ebay.com is a salutary tale for all those recent venture capital-backed web launches. It started in September 1995, an experimental site set up by Pierre Omidyar of San Jose, California. Only when it took off did Omidyar give up the day job. </p> <p>Although much imitated, eBay.com kept a lead by a constant process of customer- led innovation. Perhaps eBay's greatest innovation is its advanced feedback system, which rates traders by the number of successful transactions they have made. In a sector still plagued by fears of fraud, this has stimulated confidence in trade at eBay. It is estimated that 20% of those selling on eBay.com make a living from it. </p> <p>In contrast to the slickness of eBay, QXL's pages suffer slow links, poor site navigation and tiny print that take all the fun out of browsing. Where eBay's much copied green, blue, red and yellow logo on a white background suggests the variety of the auctions on its site, QXL's clumsy grey and orange graphics conjure up poor taste and drabness. This surely will be changed soon, though, worryingly, QXL seems to be spending its shareholders' money, on charging around Europe buying any auction site of note. </p> <p>QXL will not provide an exact figure of its UK users, but its current figure for its eight country European operation is 680,000. If the UK changes to the euro then QXL will be laughing. In the meantime, cross-Europe trades are problematic, not only because of currency differences, but also because of the language barriers. </p> <p>EBay's advantage over QXL creates its own problems. The demands that eBay's 15.8 million users worldwide (July 2000 figures) make on its system have led to lengthy system outages. At worst these breaks in service, when its system gets updated and cleaned, have led to down-times lasting days. There are weekly Friday morning shutdowns, between 1am and 5am West Coast time to cause minimum distress to US users.

      "bodyText": "You could be forgiven for thinking that QXL was the UK's biggest internet auction site considering all the publicity it has received. However, largely through word of mouse, this position looks likely to belong to eBay.co.uk, the recently opened branch of ebay.com. EBay UK had quietly built up to 127,000 users by the end of March, and is confident this figure will double by the end of the year. What is remarkable is that while QXL built up its user base through a constant stream of media coverage, eBay.co.uk, echoing its US parent site, has not yet resorted to large advertising campaigns. Ebay.com is a salutary tale for all those recent venture capital-backed web launches. It started in September 1995, an experimental site set up by Pierre Omidyar of San Jose, California. Only when it took off did Omidyar give up the day job. Although much imitated, eBay.com kept a lead by a constant process of customer- led innovation. Perhaps eBay's greatest innovation is its advanced feedback system, which rates traders by the number of successful transactions they have made. In a sector still plagued by fears of fraud, this has stimulated confidence in trade at eBay. It is estimated that 20% of those selling on eBay.com make a living from it. In contrast to the slickness of eBay, QXL's pages suffer slow links, poor site navigation and tiny print that take all the fun out of browsing. Where eBay's much copied green, blue, red and yellow logo on a white background suggests the variety of the auctions on its site, QXL's clumsy grey and orange graphics conjure up poor taste and drabness. This surely will be changed soon, though, worryingly, QXL seems to be spending its shareholders' money, on charging around Europe buying any auction site of note. QXL will not provide an exact figure of its UK users, but its current figure for its eight country European operation is 680,000. If the UK changes to the euro then QXL will be laughing. In the meantime, cross-Europe trades are problematic, not only because of currency differences, but also because of the language barriers. EBay's advantage over QXL creates its own problems. The demands that eBay's 15.8 million users worldwide (July 2000 figures) make on its system have led to lengthy system outages. At worst these breaks in service, when its system gets updated and cleaned, have led to down-times lasting days. There are weekly Friday morning shutdowns, between 1am and 5am West Coast time to cause minimum distress to US users. Unfortunately. for UK users, who are eight hours ahead, this wipes out most of the daylight hours of Friday morning. EBay has promised to reduce these outages to several minutes some time in the future. Still, tackling eBay head on with consumer-to-consumer auctions is not a battle QXL looks likely to win. But this does not mean eBay is unbeatable: in the USA, many online auction sites are thriving by offering services different to eBay. In the UK, auction sites such as Firedup.com do this by concentrating on merchant auctions alone. Owned by News International, the site benefits from constant free promotion in the Sun, Sunday Times and Times. Another site offering a different service is UK Yahoo auctions. The US branch has become eBay.com's only serious competitor through its policy of charging no listing or sales fees. In return it offers a low-profile site with next to no customer assistance. This policy of minimum maintenance has encouraged sellers of hardcore pornography and Nazi memorabilia, to the detriment of the site's reputation. It also has had a number of prank auctions.

How to get the best from auctions EBay's invention of the feedback system was the making of online auctions. The system gives a fair indication of how experienced and trustworthy other users of the site are. At eBay after each successful trade, the buyer and seller can award each other either a neutral, positive or negative comment.

I often find myself wondering that. Pat's open countenance and prodigious lung power suggested he sold something. </p> <p>And so it proved. He and his wife Nicky were on their way to the Puppy Cup Final in a white stretch Mercedes, drinking champagne and, well, moist, as Pat put it. He remembered without nostalgia the house where he was born. \"I remember living on a council estate with not two pennies to rub together. I picked mushrooms at 16 to buy my first moped.

And that made me a millionaire.\" Now he has an estate in the country and a heart condition. </p> <p>I considered this fishy formula doubtfully. I've asked several millionaires how they made their money. They all said \"hard work\", but I'd say they were gamblers.

He thinks it's genetic. </p> <p>The film was ill-named Puppy Love. I never saw him pat his dogs, even when the puppies in his paddock put their paws on the fence and panted engagingly. He said \"The way you rear a greyhound puppy is totally different to the way you'd rear a pet. They're treated like kings, really. They probably enjoy their lives more than most pets because they're doing what they were bred to do. Not many pets were bred to sit on a settee.\" His castellated house is full of images of greyhounds. The real dogs are outside in concrete kennels. </p> <p>Greyhounds race at night by sodium light, which gives a sense of something eerie going on. The dogs parted the air like combs. Pat roared: \"Come on, Droopy! Please, please! Goo-on, my boy!\" Few thought Droopy could get round the big, raw-boned favourite, but Droopy did. Suddenly Pat was surrounded by friends, who were not there before. \"That's what it's all about\", he shouted. \"That sensational feeling! Winning! Winning!\" He'd won \u00a312.40, but I don't think that's what he meant. </p> <p> <strong> The Lipstick Years </strong> (BBC 2) was about playing second fiddle. The liveliest contributor was, of course, Dr Margaret Cook, Robin's ex. She turns up from time to time like those vengeful, deposed Shakespearean queens, who cast such a blight on the coronation buffet. Pausing only to slip into her steel-capped wellies, she waded in. \"If Robin had decided to drop Gaynor and stay with me, I would have felt very betrayed and yet been expected to stand up and say: 'He's all right really', as Mary Archer has had to do recently.\" (Mary Archer, like Dr Cook, is an exceptionally clever scientist married to something genetically indistinguishable from a terrier.) </p> <p>\"I have been told I was one of the most crucial factors in helping him to get the nomination. So he did quite coldly use me in that way. I sometimes remind myself that he spent 18 years in opposition and very little of what he did was essential to anybody. Except his own career. In terms of day-to-day working for the good of people, I was probably achieving vastly more than he was in that 18 years.\" </p> <p>Far be it from me to get on the wrong side of Dr Cook, but watching Robin Cook snapping at the heels of power was one of the delights of those years.

      "bodyText": "Prince Valiant (Anthony Hickox, 1997) 10am, Sky Premier A Euro-take on the American comic-strip hero that's just the thing for the school holidays. It's Arthurian romance done in a heady pop-video style, with gothic touches from horror-man Hickox and a dash of Braveheart in the battles - but nothing too gruesome. Stephen Moyer is the lowly Camelot squire who becomes Prince Valiant; Katherine Heigl plays a very post-Leia princess, and Edward Fox is King Arthur. But best is Joanna Lumley as scheming Morgan le Fey: see AbFab's Patsy get medieval! Les Diaboliques (Henri-Georges Clouzot, 1955) 8pm, FilmFour There was no more misanthropic a practitioner of French noir than the bitter Clouzot. Here, ailing and bullied wife Vera Clouzot (the director's spouse) teams up with spurned mistress Simone Signoret to murder her husband, vicious school head Paul Meurisse. The investigation uncovers a heap of human misery and thwarted desire: don't expect many laughs. Lost Highway (David Lynch, 1997) 10pm, FilmFour Even if hardened by Twin Peaks' narrative convolutions and inured to the bizarre, violent worlds conjured up in the likes of Eraserhead and Blue Velvet, it's hard not to see this as Lynch unpinned. Bill Pullman's sax man suspects wife Patricia Arquette of infidelity. Suddenly he is suspected of her murder; but now he's disappeared, replaced by a garage mechanic (Balthazar Getty), and Arquette has turned up as a gangster's girl... Crazy, but compulsive. Paul Howlett Pretty As A Picture 12.15am, FilmFour Shot around the time of Lost Highway, this David Lynch documentary soon escapes the standard making-of guff and moves on to some great Lynch moments, with clips from early films (Six Figures Getting Sick, The Alphabet), and the cast of Eraserhead revisiting the set where they shot little over a scene a night.

      "body": "<p>Variant CJD, the human form of mad cow disease, could ultimately claim 136,000 lives, according to Oxford scientists.</p> <p>But this figure is the worst case scenario, say statisticians who have been trying to map the impact of the disease on the British population. They report in Nature today that this will be the number of deaths if the incubation period for the disease is 60 years or more.</p> <p>When the first cases of vCJD shocked ministers in 1996 - they had repeatedly claimed that the mysterious cattle disease could not be a danger to humans - there seemed no limit to the numbers potentially at risk from infected beef. A European committee conjectured that a single beast with BSE could put 500,000 people at risk.</p> <p>But Neil Ferguson, Azra Ghani, Christl Donnelly and Roy Anderson at the Wellcome Trust centre for epidemiology at Oxford University began looking at the pattern of cases and the ages of the victims, the percentage of the population most at risk, the relative infectivity of cattle at the incubation stage and the effectiveness of control measures. They calculated up to 5m scenarios and then matched them against the cases of the disease in humans.</p> <p>Any sick animal that got into the food market was liable to infect no more than two individuals, and only 40% of the population was genetically susceptible. That left one key factor in the calculation - the mean incubation period of the disease itself. If the incubation period was less than 20 years, then there could be as few as 63 cases. If the incubation period stretched almost to lifetime length, then there were likely to be 136,000. What mattered over the next few years was the annual rate of cases.</p> <p>\"If the average annual incidence of vCJD over the next three years is fewer than 15 cases, then the maximum total number of cases would fall to 20,000,\" they write.</p> <p>Classical or sporadic CJD is a disease of the old. But the victims of vCJD are all relatively young. The statisticians were anxious to see if the average ages of the cases increased with time. If they did, then it would mean that everybody was equally susceptible but younger people had shorter incubation periods. They now rule out that possibility.</p> <p>\"It is something about being young that makes you vulnerable,\" said Dr Ghani. \"Either vulnerable or exposed to a greater extent. It could be just the types of food that people eat, but it is impossible in this sort of statistics to distinguish between the two. The upper limit to the epidemic scenario has decreased quite substantially but it is still very large.\"</p>",

They report in Nature today that this will be the number of deaths if the incubation period for the disease is 60 years or more. When the first cases of vCJD shocked ministers in 1996 - they had repeatedly claimed that the mysterious cattle disease could not be a danger to humans - there seemed no limit to the numbers potentially at risk from infected beef. A European committee conjectured that a single beast with BSE could put 500,000 people at risk. But Neil Ferguson, Azra Ghani, Christl Donnelly and Roy Anderson at the Wellcome Trust centre for epidemiology at Oxford University began looking at the pattern of cases and the ages of the victims, the percentage of the population most at risk, the relative infectivity of cattle at the incubation stage and the effectiveness of control measures. They calculated up to 5m scenarios and then matched them against the cases of the disease in humans. Any sick animal that got into the food market was liable to infect no more than two individuals, and only 40% of the population was genetically susceptible. That left one key factor in the calculation - the mean incubation period of the disease itself. If the incubation period was less than 20 years, then there could be as few as 63 cases. If the incubation period stretched almost to lifetime length, then there were likely to be 136,000. What mattered over the next few years was the annual rate of cases. \"If the average annual incidence of vCJD over the next three years is fewer than 15 cases, then the maximum total number of cases would fall to 20,000,\" they write. Classical or sporadic CJD is a disease of the old. But the victims of vCJD are all relatively young. The statisticians were anxious to see if the average ages of the cases increased with time. If they did, then it would mean that everybody was equally susceptible but younger people had shorter incubation periods. They now rule out that possibility. \"It is something about being young that makes you vulnerable,\" said Dr Ghani. \"Either vulnerable or exposed to a greater extent. It could be just the types of food that people eat, but it is impossible in this sort of statistics to distinguish between the two. The upper limit to the epidemic scenario has decreased quite substantially but it is still very large.\"",

      "bodyText": "Not so long ago, the Today programme decided it needed an interview with a senior Conservative politician and I was deputed to ring his home. \"He will not talk to you tomorrow,\" his wife told me, \"nor will he the day after. He is indisposed.\" This, it turned out, was a charming understatement. Unknown to me - and the wider world at the time - the politician had been stone dead for two days. It was an embarrassing little incident and reinforced my belief that Today has a distinctly uneasy relationship with the dead. We have no natural space on Today for obituaries and are rarely certain as to when we should be doing them, or for whom. And have you noticed how famous people tend to die in pairs and thus become locked in a grisly duel for airtime?

      "body": "<p>I own a Simpsons matryoshka. I bought it in Russia in 1994 when Simpsons merchandising frenzy was at its height and you could find South Sea Islanders on far-flung archipelagos with \"Eat My Shorts\" emblazoned on their T-shirts. Traditionally, these famous Russian dolls contain smaller replicas of themselves, which contain further smaller replicas and so on. My Simpsons one, though, breaks with convention: each doll-within-a-doll depicts a different member of that famous yellow cartoon family.</p> <p>The likenesses are a little wonky, but what's really interesting is the implicit hierarchy imposed upon the characters by the local artist who drew them. Having never seen the show, he had assumed it must be aimed solely at kids. That's why he put the youngest child, baby Maggie, on the outermost shell, enclosing a brutishly stubbled Homer, then Marge carrying what appears to be an enormous blancmange festooned with blue pencils, followed by Bart, grinning, with his skateboard and, lastly, a tiny Lisa puffing on her saxophone.</p> <p>For me, there is something pleasantly skewed and suggestive about that girl-boy-girl-boy-girl order and in particular the positioning of Lisa, my favourite character, at the heart of the family. Inadvertently, it underlines what I've always thought about the show: that although Bart and Homer are the more obvious stars, the female characters are the bread that holds this family sandwich together, the ones that provide it with its fibre, its structure and the intellectual crust that makes the Simpsons so much more than just a Flintstones for modern times.</p> <p>The key Simpson women are, of course, Marge and Lisa. Close emotionally and in family resemblance, they are in all other respects as different as Itchy and Scratchy, the cartoon mouse and cat in the show within the show. Marge the happy homemaker and Lisa the cerebral feminist represent opposite poles of modern femininity, somehow reconciled through mutual respect and affection. Gravelly of voice and gargantuan of hair, Marge is a formidable matriarch whose placid nature conceals inky depths of passion, conviction and modestly concealed talent. Some of her past triumphs include a parents' campaign to clean up the violence in The Itchy and Scratchy Show and holding down jobs as a pretzel entrepreneur, a real estate agent and a ballroom dancer.</p> <p>In one episode, she dabbled in acting when cast as the fading Southern belle Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. At first she couldn't find sufficient inner fire for the role, in which she has to assault the lead male character, Stanley Kowalski. \"I just don't see why Blanche should shove a broken bottle in Stanley's face,\" she complains to the director. \"Couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle good humour?\"</p> <p>In the end, it required the insensitivity of Homer for Marge to unlock the Method in Blanche's madness. Yet what always saves the Simpson marriage in cartoon real life is that Marge is more like Stella, the compliant wife in Streetcar, than her sister Blanche. Everyone in the world knows that Marge is too good for Homer - everyone except her. She is devoted to her doltish husband, with whom she obviously enjoys a rapturously happy sex life. A number of episodes conclude with Marge and Homer preparing for their nightly \"snuggle\", excited by such kinky props as Homer's snake-whacking stick and his Mr Plow jacket.</p> <p>Marge's deepest secrets have provoked great speculation. A journalist friend who interviewed Simpsons creator Matt Groening learned that one of the most frequently asked questions in letters to the show is whether Marge has blue pubic hair. The answer remains tantalisingly open. In one episode, we see Marge buying blue dye at Apu's Kwik-E-Mart, but I like to think she is only trying to hide the grey hairs her family induce. Judging by her mother and sisters, the embittered spinsters Patty and Selma, Marge must be a natural blue.</p> <p>If Marge is the eternally giving and gracious mother we sometimes wish our own mothers were, Lisa is the girl we wish we could have the guts and smarts to be: confident but never cocky, dogmatically principled and a sassy little saxophone player. A bit of a geek, Lisa, with her atrophied vocabulary and an intellectual sophistication well beyond the reach of most grown-ups, is the one who adds intellectual ballast to the show. It's a well-known fact that almost all the writers, most of whom are men, are Ivy League graduates and Lisa is their conduit for showing off their learning, quoting Pablo Neruda, Gertrude Stein or Jean-Paul Sartre.</p> <p>With her crush on teenage pin-up Corey and her subscription to Non-Threatening Boys magazine, Lisa is still an eight-year-old, besotted with ponies and peonies. Nonetheless, a reverse sexism - which says women are always smarter than men - is one of the Simpsons underlying principles.</p> <p>The apogee of this argument is an episode in which Lisa discovers both Bart and Homer showed signs of sentience, even intelligence, in their early years, before a kind of genetic rot set in and they reverted to the dribbling, lovable fools they are. Convinced she is doomed to the same fate, Lisa despairs until her parents attempt to allay her fears by holding a family reunion. There it is revealed that the stupid gene is carried only by the Y chromosome: the Simpson men are genetically disposed to laziness, stupidity and failure, while the women are successful, competent professionals.</p> <p>On paper, that plotline sounds unbearably PC, but the show's nimble balance of sweetness and cynicism prevents it from feeling didactic. Nuclear but with extensions, founded on a solidly traditional marriage, the Simpson family are heroically conventional in genuine suburban style. Groening says he modelled them on his own baby boom era family, even naming the characters after his parents and siblings. If the Simpsons were in line with modern American demographics, Marge and Homer would be divorced and remarried, rather than the ironic exemplars of happy married life that they are.</p> <p>Crucially, at the heart of the show, there is that central family, as locked into each other as my Russian matryoshka. The show's most touching relationship is that between Homer and Lisa. Numerous episodes hinge on Homer's efforts to get closer to his brilliant, brainy daughter, ranging from suffering an excruciating visit to a museum to working two jobs so that she can have a pony.</p> <p>It is, perhaps, a testament to the discriminating good taste of British Simpsons fans that they chose \"Lisa's Wedding\" as their favourite episode when Sky ran a recent competition. It's the one where Lisa learns from a fortune-teller about her future: she will almost marry a foppish English aristocrat named Hugh, then reject him when he turns his nose up at Homer's \"vulgar\"offer of a pair of pig-shaped cufflinks to wear on the wedding day.

      "bodyText": "I own a Simpsons matryoshka. I bought it in Russia in 1994 when Simpsons merchandising frenzy was at its height and you could find South Sea Islanders on far-flung archipelagos with \"Eat My Shorts\" emblazoned on their T-shirts. Traditionally, these famous Russian dolls contain smaller replicas of themselves, which contain further smaller replicas and so on. My Simpsons one, though, breaks with convention: each doll-within-a-doll depicts a different member of that famous yellow cartoon family. The likenesses are a little wonky, but what's really interesting is the implicit hierarchy imposed upon the characters by the local artist who drew them. Having never seen the show, he had assumed it must be aimed solely at kids. That's why he put the youngest child, baby Maggie, on the outermost shell, enclosing a brutishly stubbled Homer, then Marge carrying what appears to be an enormous blancmange festooned with blue pencils, followed by Bart, grinning, with his skateboard and, lastly, a tiny Lisa puffing on her saxophone. For me, there is something pleasantly skewed and suggestive about that girl-boy-girl-boy-girl order and in particular the positioning of Lisa, my favourite character, at the heart of the family. Inadvertently, it underlines what I've always thought about the show: that although Bart and Homer are the more obvious stars, the female characters are the bread that holds this family sandwich together, the ones that provide it with its fibre, its structure and the intellectual crust that makes the Simpsons so much more than just a Flintstones for modern times. The key Simpson women are, of course, Marge and Lisa. Close emotionally and in family resemblance, they are in all other respects as different as Itchy and Scratchy, the cartoon mouse and cat in the show within the show. Marge the happy homemaker and Lisa the cerebral feminist represent opposite poles of modern femininity, somehow reconciled through mutual respect and affection. Gravelly of voice and gargantuan of hair, Marge is a formidable matriarch whose placid nature conceals inky depths of passion, conviction and modestly concealed talent. Some of her past triumphs include a parents' campaign to clean up the violence in The Itchy and Scratchy Show and holding down jobs as a pretzel entrepreneur, a real estate agent and a ballroom dancer. In one episode, she dabbled in acting when cast as the fading Southern belle Blanche DuBois in Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. At first she couldn't find sufficient inner fire for the role, in which she has to assault the lead male character, Stanley Kowalski. \"I just don't see why Blanche should shove a broken bottle in Stanley's face,\" she complains to the director. \"Couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle good humour?\" In the end, it required the insensitivity of Homer for Marge to unlock the Method in Blanche's madness. Yet what always saves the Simpson marriage in cartoon real life is that Marge is more like Stella, the compliant wife in Streetcar, than her sister Blanche. Everyone in the world knows that Marge is too good for Homer - everyone except her. She is devoted to her doltish husband, with whom she obviously enjoys a rapturously happy sex life. A number of episodes conclude with Marge and Homer preparing for their nightly \"snuggle\", excited by such kinky props as Homer's snake-whacking stick and his Mr Plow jacket. Marge's deepest secrets have provoked great speculation. A journalist friend who interviewed Simpsons creator Matt Groening learned that one of the most frequently asked questions in letters to the show is whether Marge has blue pubic hair. The answer remains tantalisingly open. In one episode, we see Marge buying blue dye at Apu's Kwik-E-Mart, but I like to think she is only trying to hide the grey hairs her family induce. Judging by her mother and sisters, the embittered spinsters Patty and Selma, Marge must be a natural blue. If Marge is the eternally giving and gracious mother we sometimes wish our own mothers were, Lisa is the girl we wish we could have the guts and smarts to be: confident but never cocky, dogmatically principled and a sassy little saxophone player. A bit of a geek, Lisa, with her atrophied vocabulary and an intellectual sophistication well beyond the reach of most grown-ups, is the one who adds intellectual ballast to the show. It's a well-known fact that almost all the writers, most of whom are men, are Ivy League graduates and Lisa is their conduit for showing off their learning, quoting Pablo Neruda, Gertrude Stein or Jean-Paul Sartre. With her crush on teenage pin-up Corey and her subscription to Non-Threatening Boys magazine, Lisa is still an eight-year-old, besotted with ponies and peonies. Nonetheless, a reverse sexism - which says women are always smarter than men - is one of the Simpsons underlying principles. The apogee of this argument is an episode in which Lisa discovers both Bart and Homer showed signs of sentience, even intelligence, in their early years, before a kind of genetic rot set in and they reverted to the dribbling, lovable fools they are. Convinced she is doomed to the same fate, Lisa despairs until her parents attempt to allay her fears by holding a family reunion. There it is revealed that the stupid gene is carried only by the Y chromosome: the Simpson men are genetically disposed to laziness, stupidity and failure, while the women are successful, competent professionals. On paper, that plotline sounds unbearably PC, but the show's nimble balance of sweetness and cynicism prevents it from feeling didactic. Nuclear but with extensions, founded on a solidly traditional marriage, the Simpson family are heroically conventional in genuine suburban style. Groening says he modelled them on his own baby boom era family, even naming the characters after his parents and siblings. If the Simpsons were in line with modern American demographics, Marge and Homer would be divorced and remarried, rather than the ironic exemplars of happy married life that they are. Crucially, at the heart of the show, there is that central family, as locked into each other as my Russian matryoshka. The show's most touching relationship is that between Homer and Lisa. Numerous episodes hinge on Homer's efforts to get closer to his brilliant, brainy daughter, ranging from suffering an excruciating visit to a museum to working two jobs so that she can have a pony. It is, perhaps, a testament to the discriminating good taste of British Simpsons fans that they chose \"Lisa's Wedding\" as their favourite episode when Sky ran a recent competition. It's the one where Lisa learns from a fortune-teller about her future: she will almost marry a foppish English aristocrat named Hugh, then reject him when he turns his nose up at Homer's \"vulgar\"offer of a pair of pig-shaped cufflinks to wear on the wedding day. Lisa comes away with a renewed pride in her boorish old man. There is no more poignant moment in television history than the final shot of Lisa listening, with eager affection, as Homer explains how he almost ate a whole suckling pig. \u0095 Leslie Felperin is a film critic and former deputy editor of Sight And Sound.

Mr Cockrell forecasts that capital expenditure is likely to rise from by \u00a320m to \u00a337m by the end of the year, and then touch \u00a3100m next year. Analysts said that the higher than anticipated expenditure could put Bookham's expected breakeven date of the end of 2001 back by three to six months. Mr Rickman said that by getting a higher volume of products into the marketplace Bookham would increase the likelihood of its technology being adopted on a global basis. He was speaking after unveiling better than expected figures for the second quarter to July 2. Revenues jumped 84% from the previous period to \u00a34.6m. Nortel Networks accounted for around 59% of orders. This is a dependency level that analysts would like to see reduced. Net losses widened from \u00a34.02m to \u00a311.3m. Staff numbers jumped 51% to 593 and by the end of July had passed 700.",

      "bodyText": "Instead of going on about brush strokes and paint textures, visitors to an exhibition opening today should admire the artist's exemplary handling of cumulonimbus, his mastery of stratocumulus, and his wayward but informed treatment of rainbows. Constable's Clouds, at the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh, is devoted to the great British obsession: the state of the weather. The artist himself said that the sky was \"the chief Organ of Sentiment\" in his pictures. John Thornes, a meteorologist who has studied Constable's cloud paintings for 20 years and has written part of the exhibition catalogue, said yesterday that he believed this to have been no mere romantic conceit, but was based on the artist's knowledge of the meteorology of his time. John Constable (1776-1837) was painting at a time when the science was in its infancy. In 1803, Luke Howard, a London chemist, published a classification of cloud types that Dr Thornes, head of the climate and atmospheric research group at Birmingham University, said remained a definitive work. Aristotle's Meteorologica had a far longer lasting influence, accepted for more than 2,000 years, but, said Dr Thornes, \"his explanations of atmospheric phenomema were nearly all completely wrong.\" Howard's work influenced the poets Goethe and Shelley, and also a young writer and amateur scientist called Thomas Forster, who wrote the first book on meteorology for general readers. Constable owned a second hand copy of the book that remains in the Constable family papers, heavily annotated by the artist. \"Constable wanted to perfect his skies, to capture a moment that also encapsulated the weather of that particular day,\" said Dr Thornes. \"His skies are so realistic that they both summarise the weather of the previous few hours, and provide a forecast of the weather to come.\" Dozens of Constable's sketches of the sky, mostly done very rapidly on Hampstead Heath in north London, are included in the show, which is part of the Edinburgh festival. On the back of each drawing he wrote notes, for example: \"Hampstead, Sept 11, 1821, 10 to 11. Morning under the sun - Clouds silvery grey on warm ground. Sultry. Light wind to SW, fine all day - but rain in the night following.\" Dr Thornes was less happy with Constable's rainbows. He grumbled that, although the painter had been perfectly capable of portraying rainbows that were scientifically correct, he would for artistic reasons place them in positions where they must cause anguish to any weatherman - as in the famous 1831 painting to be seen in the exhibition, Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows. \"He was aware of the fact that a rainbow cannot be seen once the sun is higher in the sky than 42 degrees, which it is,\" Dr Thornes complained. However, he forgave the artist for having gone \"beyond meteorological truth\" to express his desolation at the death of his wife, Maria, a desolation that the meteorologist believed might be read in the stormy skies of the later paintings. Dr Thornes had no interest at all in art until a friend took him to a Turner exhibition where he was immediately struck by the huge cloudy skies. He said yesterday that he has since moved on to an interest in LS Lowry, whose matchstick men are typically stooped under threatening grey heavens. \"His skies are very interesting - they solved a real artistic problem for him. By painting under very heavy skies, with very limited visibility, he didn't have to worry about shadows at all. \"And having hit that formula he just stuck to it - you never see a blue sky in a Lowry.\"",

They urged the government to give all headteachers an immediate salary rise of \u00a33,000, and to take urgent steps to cut red tape in schools, in order to stop a waste of high class talent through the most experienced heads taking early retirement. The warning came from the National Association of Head Teachers, which released figures showing that advertisements for headships were running at their highest level for several years, figures it will submit to the teachers' pay review body next month, ahead of the pay round. There were 1,799 ads for heads' jobs published in the Times Educational Supplement between January and June - up 40% on the same time last year and 50% ahead of the 1998 figures. The only year when there were more, 2,261, was 1997, due to thousands of heads rushing to take early retirement when the previous government tightened the rules. The association said that the statistics had \"stark messages\" for the government, given the combined difficulties of losing experienced heads and failing to attract high quality replacements. Most heads leaving were in the 50-59 age group, often simply taking early retirement rather than seeking alternative employment. Despite the attention given to so-called \"super-heads\" who command salaries of more than \u00a370,000, the association complained that, in general terms, heads' pay did not equate with the ever-growing demands of their jobs; it claimed they had three worries: pay, bureaucracy, and lack of control over budgets. The general secretary, David Hart, said: \"This country can ill afford a headteacher brain drain of this magnitude.

A Department for Education and Employment spokesman claimed that at least half the 511 additional vacancies were the result of a new retirement scheme that the national assocation itself had lobbied for, allowing \"burned out\" heads to take on lighter duties or quit the profession.

      "body": "<p>Gangland shootouts, rising juvenile violence and a big increase in serious offences have raised fears that Japan - one of the safest countries in the world - is losing the battle against crime.</p> <p>Official statistics show that Japan is in the middle of its worst crime wave in two decades, and its police service, which has been plagued by scandal, seems unable to meet the challenge.</p> <p>Just this week, two yakuza gangsters were killed and five injured in a sword and gun battle with members of a rightwing political group in Tokyo. Police have detained six members of a gang affiliated to the Sumiyoshi-kai, one of the three biggest crime syndicates in Japan, but other suspects are still at large.</p> <p>Although Britain and America remain far more dangerous, the crime wave has prompted calls for action by politicians and generated anxious editorials in the media.</p> <p>While the number of offences has increased, the arrest rate has declined. In the first six months of this year, the national police agency (NPA) investigated 1.1m crimes, an increase of 12% on the same period of 1999, and the first time that the half-year figure has exceeded 1m.</p> <p>During this period, the number of arrests fell by more than 20% to 281,000, prompting police officials to acknowledge that investigators can no longer keep up. The admission - from a police service at a low point in terms of morale and public respect - is seen as a plea both for sympathy and extra resources.</p> <p>Since late last year, the NPA has been embroiled in a series of scandals, culminating in the resignation of the country's top police officer after revelations of a high-level cover-up of drug abuse by a senior officer.</p> <p>Police methods have also come under fire, particularly after the discovery of a 19-year-old woman who had been held captive for more than nine years in the home of a child abuser. Detectives had ignored tip-offs that might have led to the teenager's release on several occasions.</p> <p>The arrest rate for murder, burglary and arson may have dropped by 12% from January to June, but for many Japanese, the most alarming crimes have been those which the police have been powerless to stop: random acts of violence by youngsters offending for the first time.</p> <p>The number of murders by teenagers almost doubled - from 27 to 53 - in the first six months of the year. The cases include a 17-year-old boy who clubbed a schoolmate and his mother to death after being bullied.The number of minors arrested for using stimulants has jumped by 45%.</p> <p>Experts are divided on the causes of this crime wave. Some say it is a reflection of the hardships of a country still struggling to emerge from its worst recession in 50 years, but many psychologists blame a lack of morality in an affluent generation over-exposed to violence in video games, television and comics.</p> <p>The prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, has pledged to introduce moral education in the country's schools and the government has established a panel of experts to consider ways to tackle youth crime, including stiffer penalties for juveniles.</p> <p>Nationalist political leaders, however, have blamed the immigrant population. Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara has warned that some areas of the capital are no longer safe after dark because of foreign gangsters.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gangland shootouts, rising juvenile violence and a big increase in serious offences have raised fears that Japan - one of the safest countries in the world - is losing the battle against crime. Official statistics show that Japan is in the middle of its worst crime wave in two decades, and its police service, which has been plagued by scandal, seems unable to meet the challenge. Just this week, two yakuza gangsters were killed and five injured in a sword and gun battle with members of a rightwing political group in Tokyo. Police have detained six members of a gang affiliated to the Sumiyoshi-kai, one of the three biggest crime syndicates in Japan, but other suspects are still at large. Although Britain and America remain far more dangerous, the crime wave has prompted calls for action by politicians and generated anxious editorials in the media. While the number of offences has increased, the arrest rate has declined. In the first six months of this year, the national police agency (NPA) investigated 1.1m crimes, an increase of 12% on the same period of 1999, and the first time that the half-year figure has exceeded 1m. During this period, the number of arrests fell by more than 20% to 281,000, prompting police officials to acknowledge that investigators can no longer keep up. The admission - from a police service at a low point in terms of morale and public respect - is seen as a plea both for sympathy and extra resources. Since late last year, the NPA has been embroiled in a series of scandals, culminating in the resignation of the country's top police officer after revelations of a high-level cover-up of drug abuse by a senior officer. Police methods have also come under fire, particularly after the discovery of a 19-year-old woman who had been held captive for more than nine years in the home of a child abuser. Detectives had ignored tip-offs that might have led to the teenager's release on several occasions. The arrest rate for murder, burglary and arson may have dropped by 12% from January to June, but for many Japanese, the most alarming crimes have been those which the police have been powerless to stop: random acts of violence by youngsters offending for the first time. The number of murders by teenagers almost doubled - from 27 to 53 - in the first six months of the year. The cases include a 17-year-old boy who clubbed a schoolmate and his mother to death after being bullied.The number of minors arrested for using stimulants has jumped by 45%. Experts are divided on the causes of this crime wave. Some say it is a reflection of the hardships of a country still struggling to emerge from its worst recession in 50 years, but many psychologists blame a lack of morality in an affluent generation over-exposed to violence in video games, television and comics. The prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, has pledged to introduce moral education in the country's schools and the government has established a panel of experts to consider ways to tackle youth crime, including stiffer penalties for juveniles. Nationalist political leaders, however, have blamed the immigrant population. Tokyo governor Shintaro Ishihara has warned that some areas of the capital are no longer safe after dark because of foreign gangsters.",

More than 100 animals died from the disease before it was diagnosed. The Ministry of Agriculture thought it had been eradicated from the UK. To try to stop the infection spreading to more than half a million pigs in the country, a three-kilometre exclusion zone has been introduced around the farm, near Woodbridge, and farmers will not be allowed to move pigs in the area. All visitors' footwear and vehicles going to farms in the area will have to go through a powerful disinfectant \"dip\". A team of agriculture ministry inspectors will call on other farms, but a spokesman stressed that the swine fever poses no threat to human health. The batch of pigs that died had come from a farm in Norfolk, and urgent checks were being made to see if another batch of piglets from the same source also had the disease. Like BSE, swine fever can be spread by feeding infected meat products to pigs. In the 1960s it was such a menace that all pig feed had to be heat treated, and over a three-year period it was thought to have been eradicated. Yesterday the ministry said it was at a loss to know how it had suddenly reappeared in Suffolk. The last outbreak, in 1986, had been a single one, and it was hoped that this one could also be confined. The disease, also known as hog cholera, is a carried by a highly infectious virus and can be transmitted in dead meat. Farmers fear that the growing trend of raising pigs outdoors could lead to the rapid spread of swine fever. Ministry officials are still considering how to get rid of the carcasses of the infected herd - either by burying them on the farm or putting them in sealed containers to be taken for rendering, so that all the virus would be destroyed by heat. James Black, vice chairman of the National Pig Association, who also farms in Suffolk, said: \"We are all extremely concerned about the implications. \"This is a very serious disease that is easily spread from pig to pig and can even be carried by staff and vehicles.

      "body": "<p>The pimps and prostitutes of Yokohama City are used to being hassled by police officers and yakuza gangsters, but they may soon be shaken down by an altogether new face: the tax man. </p> <p>With local government revenues shrinking amid the worst recession in 50 years, the mayor of Yokohama, Hidenobu Takahide, has proposed the introduction of Japan's first sin tax, taking a cut from sex and gambling. </p> <p>Numerous obstacles - including red tape, opposition from organised crime syndicates and accusations of unfairness - need to be overcome, but the Yokohama plan is being closely watched by other Japanese municipalities, many of which are close to bankruptcy. </p> <p>Walk around Akebono-cho red light district, and it soon becomes clear why the sex industry is an obvious target in this port city. </p> <p>The main drag is lined with garishly coloured, neon-lit buildings with names like Princess Peach, The Pink House, and St Gospel School's Costume Play - all of which seem to be doing a better trade than conventional local firms. </p> <p>Many of these places are so-called fashion health establishments, which circumvent the prohibition on prostitution in Clinton style by offering only oral sex. </p> <p>It is a lucrative business. Signboards outside every door list prices ranging from about 7,000 to 15,000 yen (about \u00a344 to \u00a395) for 40 minutes, depending on the time of day, the age of the women and extras, such as dressing up as schoolgirls. Most places start at 10am and, according to local residents, have a steady stream of customers until the early hours of the morning. These businesses are supposed to pay about 43% of their profit in corporate tax - the same as any other private firm. Officials in the mayor's office say, however, that brothels and fashion health establishments usually doctor their accounts to ensure they pay next to nothing. </p> <p>All this will change if Mr Takahide has his way.

      "bodyText": "The pimps and prostitutes of Yokohama City are used to being hassled by police officers and yakuza gangsters, but they may soon be shaken down by an altogether new face: the tax man. With local government revenues shrinking amid the worst recession in 50 years, the mayor of Yokohama, Hidenobu Takahide, has proposed the introduction of Japan's first sin tax, taking a cut from sex and gambling. Numerous obstacles - including red tape, opposition from organised crime syndicates and accusations of unfairness - need to be overcome, but the Yokohama plan is being closely watched by other Japanese municipalities, many of which are close to bankruptcy. Walk around Akebono-cho red light district, and it soon becomes clear why the sex industry is an obvious target in this port city. The main drag is lined with garishly coloured, neon-lit buildings with names like Princess Peach, The Pink House, and St Gospel School's Costume Play - all of which seem to be doing a better trade than conventional local firms. Many of these places are so-called fashion health establishments, which circumvent the prohibition on prostitution in Clinton style by offering only oral sex. It is a lucrative business. Signboards outside every door list prices ranging from about 7,000 to 15,000 yen (about \u00a344 to \u00a395) for 40 minutes, depending on the time of day, the age of the women and extras, such as dressing up as schoolgirls. Most places start at 10am and, according to local residents, have a steady stream of customers until the early hours of the morning. These businesses are supposed to pay about 43% of their profit in corporate tax - the same as any other private firm. Officials in the mayor's office say, however, that brothels and fashion health establishments usually doctor their accounts to ensure they pay next to nothing. All this will change if Mr Takahide has his way. The mayor has set up a panel to investigate ways to levy a new local tax on sex shops, betting offices and pachinko, or gambling machine, parlours. It is expected to announce its conclusions by the end of this year. \"Most local governments are in dire financial straits as welfare expenditures have increased while revenues have decreased,\" the mayor explained in a recent interview. \"To narrow the gap we need to increase revenues.\" Yokohama's tax income has fallen steadily over the past four years as local companies and residents have been hit by the recession.

Meanwhile, it has had to pay more for health and social services to care for the growing number of elderly residents. It is a pattern that has been repeated across the country, leaving many municipalities in a worse state than Yokohama. As of April, local governments owed a staggering \u00a5179 trillion - just over \u00a31 trillion - in debt, more than Britain's entire annual output. The figure has almost tripled in the past 10 years. Seven prefectures, including Tokyo and Osaka, have declared financial crises. In good times, the main source of revenue for local governments is corporate tax, but two-thirds of Japan's companies are now losing money so they do not pay a single yen. Many municipalities rely on central government grants to stay solvent, but these could soon dry up. On Tuesday, a government panel recommended cutting subsidies to encourage local authorities to be more independent. Desperate for new income flows, Tokyo and Osaka - the country's two biggest and most indebted municipalities - have recently introduced new taxes on banks. This has been made possible by the implementation this year of a new local law which gives regional authorities more power over their finances.

      "body": "<p>Derek Hill, who has died aged 83, won respect as a painter in oils in the early 1950s. It is only in the last decade, however, that respect has broadened into appreciation of his significance. Best known in Britain as a portrait painter, chronicler of that fading Anthony Powell world where high society meets the power nexus as well as haute boh\u00e8me, Hill came to be seen in his adopted home of Ireland as the master of that country's wild western coastline and broken Atlantic light. To the British, Hill is an interesting anomaly; the \"last of the gentlemen painters\" is a phrase much used. In Ireland he is a national figure.</p> <p>Such contradictions, successfully reconciled in his work, fall off the page when you remember Derek or consider his life and character. He was an intensely social being who thought of himself as a loner. \"All I want is peace,\" he would say to his friends. Woe betide any who granted this wish by failing to include him in their invitations. This seldom happened. He was excellent company and had good tales to tell. His life as a traveller, a stage designer, an art collector, a painter of famous people, an expert in Islamic architecture, a promoter of talents other than his own, a gardener, and chocoholic equipped him as a raconteur. He was also empathetic and could share the ups and downs of the personal and emotional life of his friends - emotions he had himself to some degree evaded. When I was writing an appreciation of him, published in 1997, he told me that he had never experienced a satisfying physical relationship. Teasing was the best antidote to the legendary Hill attribute of social touchiness. As a friend, you needed to underline the difficulties caused by his occupying a space-time dimension which simultaneously included an evening with the Guermantes circle, as it were, and painting by himself on Tory, an island off (and frequently cut off from) the Donegal coast. Most people who sat for Hill as a portraitist agreed that his ability to paint and converse at the same time was both relaxing and enchanting. His cast of characters include: Freddie Mills; Artur Rubenstein; Bernard Berenson; Lords Hailsham; Mountbatten, Dufferin, Drogheda, Zuckerman and Longford; Isaiah Berlin; Anthony Eden; John Betjeman; Frederick Ashton; No\u00ebl Coward; LP Hartley; Kenneth Clarke; Steven Runciman; Osbert Lancaster; Wilfred Thesiger; Tony O'Reilly; Erskine Childers; George Christie and the Duke of Buccleuch. His last major portrait was of Alec Guinness - \"so delightful, but so difficult because his genius depends on the anonymity of his face\" - whom Derek pre-deceased by a few days. There are two portraits of the Prince of Wales, to whom Derek was devoted. The friendship was reciprocated, as Prince Charles was rightly confident that it was exclusive of his position. But as well as the droppable names, the best portraits include friends and neighbours in Rome, Donegal or on Tory.</p> <p>Hill's landscapes, by contrast, are lonely and seldom peopled. The Irish writer Monk Gibbon put it well. \"What is strange,\" he wrote in 1963, \"is that someone like Derek Hill, a humanist with a keen love of social contacts, should have discovered in one of the bleakest and most remote corners of western Europe the seascapes and landscapes themes which many people consider has led him to complete artistic fulfilment.\"</p> <p>The larger paintings of rocks and sea on Tory rank among the very best pure landscapes painted anywhere since 1945. The \"tiny postcard masterpieces\", as Derek's Donegal neighbour the American art collector Henry P McIlhenny called Hill's less sculptured landscapes, have the fleeting intensity of a light that changes each minute. They are poetic indeed, but grounded in Hill's knowledge of abstract proportions and his experience as a young designer in a Munich influenced by the Bauhaus before the war.</p> <p>Derek's father was AJL Hill, a cricket captain of Hampshire. The family lived at Romsey and were friends of the Mountbattens. Derek painted Earl Mountbatten, and there is a fine view of Ben Bulben and the stretch of water where Mountbatten was eventually murdered, painted from a lavatory window at Cassiebawn, the Mountbatten's Irish home. AJL Hill was a shrewd businessman and Derek never wanted for money. (He tended to purchase his own paintings when they appeared on the market. As he complained that he was insufficiently appreciated, I had to explain that taste is formed, like it or not, by the market, and that even the best painters need dealers or agents to promote them.)</p> <p>His parents were tolerant of his leaving Marlborough School at 16 to devote himself to the arts: he was for a time a pupil of Kurt Schwitters. While not unsuccessful as a stage designer (he was influenced by a sojourn in Moscow and was knowledgeable about ballet as well as opera), it was the Paris-based English couturier, Edward Molyneaux, who persuaded him to concentrate on painting alone. Molyneaux's great art collection of French Impressionist and post Impressionist paintings (sold to Mrs Mellon and now the bedrock of the National Gallery at Washington collection) taught him light. The best Hills, however, are architectural in the way of Corot, Courbet and C\u00e9zanne.</p> <p>One of Hill's most endearing qualities, both as an artist and as a man, was his generosity to those younger than himself and his encouragement of young artists. As a director of the British School in Rome in the 1950s, he nourished such talent as Michael Andrews, John Bratby and Anthony Fry. His own art collection was very fine with great examples of the misty Thames landscape and early abstract paintings of his friend Victor Pasmore.</p> <p>Hill settled in Donegal in 1954. Hitherto his closest thing to a home had been I Tatti, Bernard Berenson's Florentine villa now owned by Harvard. He purchased an old rectory and 20 lakeside acres for \u00a31,000. Here he created a house and a garden which has been featured in many books as masterpieces of interior and garden design. An older brother, John, was a distinguished decorator and he and Derek discovered, and bought, rolls of original Morris wallpapers, which were being used as drawer-lining paper in an Edinburgh hotel. Islamic objects, colours, textiles and designs were also important; Derek published collaborative studies of Islamic architecture in the 1960s and 1970s. My own family lived 15 miles away and as a teenager I would ride over unsurfaced roads to stay in the magical house and eat wonderful food. Elizabeth David, a frequent guest, said that Derek's cook-housekeeper, Gracie, was the best natural cook she had ever encountered. I would return with a loaned Moore maquette in my knapsack or a Sutherland gouache and the beginnings of an educated eye. After making over Glebe House to the Irish nation in the early 1980s, Derek shared a minute cottage with Gracie, who was about 10 years older. They bickered contentedly, like a long-married couple, and I once had to rescue the marriage by cooking for them both.</p> <p>Hill was made CBE in 1997. For his own paintings, for his generosity, for his work as the impressario-creator of the Tory school of naive marine painters, Derek Hill was made an honorary Irish citizen in 1999 by the President of the Republic, Mrs McAleese. It was a signal and deserved honour, an emblem in its own way of the \"peace process\", and it gave him immeasurable pleasure.</p> <p>\u0095 Derek Hill, painter, born December 6 1916; died July 30 2000</p>",

Kinn and John Lennon had almost come to blows during the 1964 Pollwinners Concert. This was the annual NME jamboree in which Britain's top music acts took part each year at the Empire Pool, Wembley.

Tomorrow, we have news of Britain's number one holiday hot spot.</p> <p>\u0095Thanks to Claire Chaney, who marks Gerald Kaufman Month with a memory from an August 1994 train trip for athletics fans from Helsinki to St Petersburg. \"We saw a familiar figure on the platform and asked him who he was. He was Gerald Kaufman. Imagine!\" Gosh. \"At the Russian border, we had to get off to change money. When Gerald got to the front of the queue, he cross-questioned the young lady about taxi fares in St Petersburg - how much, was the service any good, were the cars up to standard. He seemed to think she was his PA. We were astounded by this boorish display. I cannot think,\" Claire concludes, \"of any reason to love him.\" Bit harsh, Claire. Bit harsh.</p> <p>\u0095Today, meanwhile, we are collecting the Spitting Image Gerald from the London home of the show's producer, Roger Law, that soon-to-be-exhibiting artist. Later this month, the latex Gerald will tour Leeds mounted on a pole and borne aloft in the \u00a3250,000 Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible, RR1. If this outing is a success, there is every chance that a full national tour will eventually follow.</p> <p>\u0095Here's something for William Hague to ponder over his barrel of Old Thatch's Moist Gusset down the pub tonight. In Rio, Bernd Noveke has won a lawsuit against his former employer after claiming that his job as a beer taster turned him into an alcoholic. Mr Noveke told the court that he was forced to drink 13 to 17 daily pints - 14, we suspect - and the Brahma brewery was ordered to pay him $30,000 compensation and a $2,500 monthly pension.</p>",

Call 01626 362319 for further details - and then let us know all about it. Tomorrow, we have news of Britain's number one holiday hot spot. \u0095Thanks to Claire Chaney, who marks Gerald Kaufman Month with a memory from an August 1994 train trip for athletics fans from Helsinki to St Petersburg. \"We saw a familiar figure on the platform and asked him who he was. He was Gerald Kaufman. Imagine!\" Gosh. \"At the Russian border, we had to get off to change money. When Gerald got to the front of the queue, he cross-questioned the young lady about taxi fares in St Petersburg - how much, was the service any good, were the cars up to standard. He seemed to think she was his PA. We were astounded by this boorish display. I cannot think,\" Claire concludes, \"of any reason to love him.\" Bit harsh, Claire. Bit harsh. \u0095Today, meanwhile, we are collecting the Spitting Image Gerald from the London home of the show's producer, Roger Law, that soon-to-be-exhibiting artist. Later this month, the latex Gerald will tour Leeds mounted on a pole and borne aloft in the \u00a3250,000 Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible, RR1. If this outing is a success, there is every chance that a full national tour will eventually follow. \u0095Here's something for William Hague to ponder over his barrel of Old Thatch's Moist Gusset down the pub tonight. In Rio, Bernd Noveke has won a lawsuit against his former employer after claiming that his job as a beer taster turned him into an alcoholic. Mr Noveke told the court that he was forced to drink 13 to 17 daily pints - 14, we suspect - and the Brahma brewery was ordered to pay him $30,000 compensation and a $2,500 monthly pension.",

The brain of Ishi, which was held at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, has been returned this week to Native Americans in California for a secret burial in tribal grounds. The handover brings to an end a three-year campaign for the return of the brain, which had been kept for scientific research, to enable Ishi to be buried as he had wanted. Ishi - he never divulged his real name and was called by his dialect's word for man -walked out of the wilderness into Oroville in Butte County, northern California, in 1911. Then aged about 50, he was believed to be the last surviving member of the Yahis, who had numbered 20,000 a century earlier, before disease and massacres carried out by white settlers took their toll. Held in jail for a week, Ishi was later introduced to two anthropologists, Thomas Waterman and Alfred Kroeber, and helped them to transcribe his dialect at the Anthropology Museum attached to the University of California in San Francisco. He would demonstrate his weaving skills and sing in the museum and for a while was a sensational \"exhibit\" for San Franciscans who queued up to see him. He also worked as a caretaker at the nearby medical college, where he would help nurses clean their implements and sing to patients in his dialect. Recordings of his singing still exist. He was said to have been very keen that his language should be preserved and pressed the anthropologists to work harder on the project, possibly because he was aware that his time was short. Literature of the time describes him as someone of great dignity - he refused to pose stripped to the waist for photographers, choosing to wear the suit, shirt and tie he had been given. He enjoyed theatre and opera and had his own bank account. After five years in San Francisco he died, probably of TB, in March 1916.

      "byline": "Joann Fletcher",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>His superb gold death mask is the most familiar treasure from Tutankhamun's tomb, but few realise the Egyptian pharaoh (1336-1327 BC) was also buried with a whole range of clothing - from sumptuous robes and stunning regalia to his baby clothes, a large supply of clean, neatly folded underwear and even several pairs of socks. </p> <p>An exhibition now touring Europe takes us inside this ancient Egyptian wardrobe to show us the young king as he would actually have looked. And staring back at us we see a living human being instead of the remote, mythical figure who has for so long been locked in a cliched world of gold and curses ever since the discovery of his tomb in 1922. </p> <p>Among the thousands of objects removed during the 10 years it took him to clear the tomb, archaeologist Howard Carter discovered great quantities of textiles of various sorts. These had originally been carefully folded and placed inside beautifully decorated storage chests, but thieves who struck not long after the burial pulled many of the garments out in their search for gold. The officials sent in to restore the tomb found something resembling a closing-down sale, and, in their attempts to tidy up quickly, stuffed the clothes back into the nearest box. </p> <p>Despite their 3,000 year-old creases, Carter immediately realised the significance of this particular find and confidently announced that \"it will be of extreme importance to the history of textile art and it needs very careful study\". </p> <p>Sadly, this unique material lay neglected for a full 70 years during which time it suffered irreparable damage. Its importance was realised only in the early 1990s when Yorkshire-born textile historian Dr Gillian Vogelsang-Eastwood began her painstaking study of the young king's wardrobe. </p> <p>Based at the Stitching Textile Research Centre in Leiden, in the Netherlands, her work over the last eight years has resulted in the new exhibition which gives fresh insight into the range of clothing worn by the pharaohs, and, since the king had also saved his baby clothes, those worn by royal princes. Because the original garments themselves have deteriorated so much - almost all are now badly faded and some little more than a black, crumbly mass - it was decided to save the fragile originals from even further damage by making exact copies. </p> <p>Of the several hundred garments found in the tomb, the team prepared a representative collection of 36, ranging from the king's most elaborate, gold-encrusted tunics to the simple triangles of fabric worn as underwear. And then of course, the royal socks, made with a gap between the large and smaller toes for the thongs of his flip-flop type sandals, 47 pairs of which were found in the tomb. </p> <p> The recreated garments had to be made of the finest linen, but modern machinery could not produce the fine quality of thread necessary for the gossamer-like material. So the team called in Swedish and Italian specialists who went back to the ancient methods of textile production. </p> <p>The team also worked out the original vivid colours from the blackened originals. Again recreating the exact shades proved tricky. The indigo was finally matched in Japan, and although a Swedish craftsman came up with the perfect recipe for a plant-based red dye, the time-consuming dyeing process involving a mix ture of sheep excrement and rancid olive oil proved too much. The team had to resort to a more convenient synthetic red. </p> <p>The basic construction of the garments is relatively simple, but the various effects which can be created are actually quite sophisticated and their sari-like drapery perfectly suited to Egypt's climate. </p> <p>During the reconstruction, the team worked out that Tutankhamun had a 31 inch chest, 29 inch waist and 43 inch hips, a distinctive \"pear shape\" apparently shared by other members of his family, if the art of the time is to be believed. </p> <p>The replicas have also solved the problem of how the clothes were originally worn. Vogelsang-Eastwood is a great believer in \"hands-on\" archaeology, and during their recreation had her students (and the author) try them on. By parading around in the regal replicas the team worked out the exact function of many of the more curious-looking garments. Two strange \"headdresses\", for example, were actually meant to be worn on the arms to form the wings of the falcon, emblem of the Egyptian king. </p> <p>In fact, quite a number of the clothes were intended to enhance the king's status in their use of regal motifs and symbols of power as decoration. Bands of coloured hieroglyphs proclaim Tutankhamun to be \"Protector of his country\" and \"Vanquisher of all the foes of Egypt\", and even as he walked along he would be crushing his enemies with every step, grinding them face down into the dust, since their images were painted on the soles of his gilded sandals. </p> <p>As \"son of the Sun god\", he would have quite literally dazzled his subjects in his glittering robes, their lavish gold and beaded decoration making a delicate tinkling sound whenever he moved. </p> <p>Surrounded by clouds of perfumed incense, he would also have smelt quite ravishing, his body doused in sweet oils, thick black kohl encircling his eyes and to complete the look a fashionable wig worn over his shaven head. </p> <p>With each outfit completed by a selection of golden collars, earrings, bracelets and one of the many royal crowns, the pharaoh must have been an awe-inspiring sight, a living god who must look the part at all times. </p> <p>Yet the replicas prove many of the costumes were incredibly heavy to wear, especially during long state occasions in the oppressive Egyptian heat. For an adult they must have proved very uncomfortable, and for a child even more so. </p> <p>Given that Tutankhamen became pharaoh at only nine years old and was dead by 20, it is difficult not to feel great sympathy for a child so dominated by those around him. </p> <p>In the uncertain political times in which he lived, every aspect of his life was controlled, even to his choice of clothing. The mantle of state, however beautiful, must surely have been a very heavy burden. </p> <p>\u0095 Joann Fletcher's book Egypt's Sun King: Amenhotep III, is published by Duncan Baird, price \u00a316.99 </p> <p>\u0095 The exhibition will visit Edinburgh, Leeds and London. </p> <p>\u0095 Tutankhamun's Wardrobe: Garments From The Tomb Of Tutankhamun by G.

      "bodyText": "His superb gold death mask is the most familiar treasure from Tutankhamun's tomb, but few realise the Egyptian pharaoh (1336-1327 BC) was also buried with a whole range of clothing - from sumptuous robes and stunning regalia to his baby clothes, a large supply of clean, neatly folded underwear and even several pairs of socks. An exhibition now touring Europe takes us inside this ancient Egyptian wardrobe to show us the young king as he would actually have looked. And staring back at us we see a living human being instead of the remote, mythical figure who has for so long been locked in a cliched world of gold and curses ever since the discovery of his tomb in 1922. Among the thousands of objects removed during the 10 years it took him to clear the tomb, archaeologist Howard Carter discovered great quantities of textiles of various sorts. These had originally been carefully folded and placed inside beautifully decorated storage chests, but thieves who struck not long after the burial pulled many of the garments out in their search for gold. The officials sent in to restore the tomb found something resembling a closing-down sale, and, in their attempts to tidy up quickly, stuffed the clothes back into the nearest box. Despite their 3,000 year-old creases, Carter immediately realised the significance of this particular find and confidently announced that \"it will be of extreme importance to the history of textile art and it needs very careful study\". Sadly, this unique material lay neglected for a full 70 years during which time it suffered irreparable damage. Its importance was realised only in the early 1990s when Yorkshire-born textile historian Dr Gillian Vogelsang-Eastwood began her painstaking study of the young king's wardrobe. Based at the Stitching Textile Research Centre in Leiden, in the Netherlands, her work over the last eight years has resulted in the new exhibition which gives fresh insight into the range of clothing worn by the pharaohs, and, since the king had also saved his baby clothes, those worn by royal princes. Because the original garments themselves have deteriorated so much - almost all are now badly faded and some little more than a black, crumbly mass - it was decided to save the fragile originals from even further damage by making exact copies. Of the several hundred garments found in the tomb, the team prepared a representative collection of 36, ranging from the king's most elaborate, gold-encrusted tunics to the simple triangles of fabric worn as underwear. And then of course, the royal socks, made with a gap between the large and smaller toes for the thongs of his flip-flop type sandals, 47 pairs of which were found in the tomb. The recreated garments had to be made of the finest linen, but modern machinery could not produce the fine quality of thread necessary for the gossamer-like material. So the team called in Swedish and Italian specialists who went back to the ancient methods of textile production. The team also worked out the original vivid colours from the blackened originals. Again recreating the exact shades proved tricky. The indigo was finally matched in Japan, and although a Swedish craftsman came up with the perfect recipe for a plant-based red dye, the time-consuming dyeing process involving a mix ture of sheep excrement and rancid olive oil proved too much. The team had to resort to a more convenient synthetic red. The basic construction of the garments is relatively simple, but the various effects which can be created are actually quite sophisticated and their sari-like drapery perfectly suited to Egypt's climate. During the reconstruction, the team worked out that Tutankhamun had a 31 inch chest, 29 inch waist and 43 inch hips, a distinctive \"pear shape\" apparently shared by other members of his family, if the art of the time is to be believed. The replicas have also solved the problem of how the clothes were originally worn. Vogelsang-Eastwood is a great believer in \"hands-on\" archaeology, and during their recreation had her students (and the author) try them on. By parading around in the regal replicas the team worked out the exact function of many of the more curious-looking garments. Two strange \"headdresses\", for example, were actually meant to be worn on the arms to form the wings of the falcon, emblem of the Egyptian king. In fact, quite a number of the clothes were intended to enhance the king's status in their use of regal motifs and symbols of power as decoration. Bands of coloured hieroglyphs proclaim Tutankhamun to be \"Protector of his country\" and \"Vanquisher of all the foes of Egypt\", and even as he walked along he would be crushing his enemies with every step, grinding them face down into the dust, since their images were painted on the soles of his gilded sandals. As \"son of the Sun god\", he would have quite literally dazzled his subjects in his glittering robes, their lavish gold and beaded decoration making a delicate tinkling sound whenever he moved. Surrounded by clouds of perfumed incense, he would also have smelt quite ravishing, his body doused in sweet oils, thick black kohl encircling his eyes and to complete the look a fashionable wig worn over his shaven head. With each outfit completed by a selection of golden collars, earrings, bracelets and one of the many royal crowns, the pharaoh must have been an awe-inspiring sight, a living god who must look the part at all times. Yet the replicas prove many of the costumes were incredibly heavy to wear, especially during long state occasions in the oppressive Egyptian heat. For an adult they must have proved very uncomfortable, and for a child even more so. Given that Tutankhamen became pharaoh at only nine years old and was dead by 20, it is difficult not to feel great sympathy for a child so dominated by those around him. In the uncertain political times in which he lived, every aspect of his life was controlled, even to his choice of clothing. The mantle of state, however beautiful, must surely have been a very heavy burden. \u0095 Joann Fletcher's book Egypt's Sun King: Amenhotep III, is published by Duncan Baird, price \u00a316.99 \u0095 The exhibition will visit Edinburgh, Leeds and London. \u0095 Tutankhamun's Wardrobe: Garments From The Tomb Of Tutankhamun by G.

      "bodyText": "You might not think dancing hamsters and the 'flu have much in common, other than the ability to irritate. But they do - thanks to a theory which suggests ideas and information may replicate themselves in the same way viruses spread. These self-replicating packets of information were christened \"memes\" (pronounced \"meems\") by author Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene. And you will recognise them from countless urban myths, email \"spams\" and net-born heroes like Turkish web celeb Mahir \"I kiss you\" Cagil. These are much more than just whispers being passed down a line. Religion and ritual are memes, as are fashions, political ideas and moral codes. They are copied from one person to the next, planting fundamental beliefs and values that gain more authority with each new host. Memes are the very building blocks of culture. Not every meme is a big idea, but any meme with the right stuff can go global once it hits the internet. For anyone who has not seen the Hampster Dance (sic), its appeal is difficult to explain. A page of crudely animated hamsters singing the same few notes over and over (and over and over) would not get past the planning stage at most dot.coms. But for Thomas Lotze, a student at Harvard University, it was a mammoth web hit. He found the hamsters on a page that included porn banners and copied them over to his own smut-free site in February of 1999. Within two weeks it had attracted 13,000 hits, spawning a phenomena that lead to hundreds of imitators, an unofficial single by UK group the Cuban Boys and, that most American indicator of success, threats of legal action for breach of copyright. The hampsters' creator, Deirdre LaCarte, runs a company promoting the rodent ravers (they now live at www.hampsterdance2.com). In a medium where the replication and redistribution of information happens faster than you can say \"I Kiss You\", the most unlikely things thrive.

Other features include a 1.8inch LCD monitor, a pop-up flash and programmed auto exposure options. Three new models and a printer will go on sale in the autumn. </p> <p><strong> For the record</strong><br> Americans will soon be able to take home a DVD recorder. Later this month Panasonic is to start selling its DMR-E10 DVD-ram video recorder in limited numbers for $3,999. </p> <p>The recorder uses 4.7GB discs to store up to two and half hours of high quality video and is compatible with both PCs and AV equipment. </p> <p>The recorder can download VHS-based video, clean up the image and then store it on the DVD-ram disc. </p> <p>Panasonic expects to start selling the recorder in the UK next year and has plans to launch several other DVD-ram-based products in the next year including a PC drive and a camcorder. </p> <p>Computers featuring a DVD-ram drive are scheduled to go on sale in the US before the end of the year. (AN)</p> <p><strong> Plush Palm </strong><br> Palm Inc this week launched a new palmtop computer for the fashion conscious with \u00a3130 ($149 in the US) to spare. The m100 is black, but can be customised with mobile phone-style snap-on face-plates available in silver mist, blue mist, green mist, pacific blue and ruby pearl for \u00a319 each ($19.95 in the US). This follows a deal, announced in May, for a <a href=\"http://www.claudiaschiffer.com\">Claudia Schiffer edition of the Palm Vx</a>). </p> <p>The m100 has a rounded base and looks a lot like Compaq's iPaq PocketPC palmtop, except that model is silver. Compaq will also take the faceplate route with a new range of Presario PCs and Presario 1400 notebooks that take MyStyle Accent Colour kits. </p> <p>Palm has dominated the market for pen-operated palmtop computers but is under pressure from Handspring, a start-up founded by the original Palm team. Handspring's Visor is already available in a range of colours and has a Springboard expansion slot that the Palm lacks. </p> <p>The m100 is more aggressively priced than earlier Palms. Although the Palm m100 HotSync Cradle - for synchronising data with a personal computer - costs another \u00a328, it is still \u00a320 cheaper than a comparable 2MB Visor with free USB cradle. </p> <p><strong> Read this!</strong><br> Microsoft has introduced a version of its Reader software, familiar from Windows CE 3-based PocketPCs, for desktop PCs. It can now be downloaded free from at <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/reader/\">www.microsoft.com/reader</a>. </p> <p>The launch is part of an \"eBook initiative\" involving Barnesandnoble.com, the bookseller, which will sell 2,000 titles in the Microsoft format, adding about 150 titles every week.

      "bodyText": "It's a snap Olympus is beginning its rollout of new digital cameras with a new medium priced model aimed at home users. The \u00a3469.99 Camedia C-990 Zoom, pictured here, boasts a resolution of 2.11 megapixels, comes with an 8MB SmartMedia card and incorporates QuickTime Movie facilities. Other features include a 1.8inch LCD monitor, a pop-up flash and programmed auto exposure options. Three new models and a printer will go on sale in the autumn. For the record Americans will soon be able to take home a DVD recorder. Later this month Panasonic is to start selling its DMR-E10 DVD-ram video recorder in limited numbers for $3,999. The recorder uses 4.7GB discs to store up to two and half hours of high quality video and is compatible with both PCs and AV equipment. The recorder can download VHS-based video, clean up the image and then store it on the DVD-ram disc. Panasonic expects to start selling the recorder in the UK next year and has plans to launch several other DVD-ram-based products in the next year including a PC drive and a camcorder. Computers featuring a DVD-ram drive are scheduled to go on sale in the US before the end of the year. (AN) Plush Palm Palm Inc this week launched a new palmtop computer for the fashion conscious with \u00a3130 ($149 in the US) to spare. The m100 is black, but can be customised with mobile phone-style snap-on face-plates available in silver mist, blue mist, green mist, pacific blue and ruby pearl for \u00a319 each ($19.95 in the US). This follows a deal, announced in May, for a Claudia Schiffer edition of the Palm Vx). The m100 has a rounded base and looks a lot like Compaq's iPaq PocketPC palmtop, except that model is silver. Compaq will also take the faceplate route with a new range of Presario PCs and Presario 1400 notebooks that take MyStyle Accent Colour kits. Palm has dominated the market for pen-operated palmtop computers but is under pressure from Handspring, a start-up founded by the original Palm team. Handspring's Visor is already available in a range of colours and has a Springboard expansion slot that the Palm lacks. The m100 is more aggressively priced than earlier Palms. Although the Palm m100 HotSync Cradle - for synchronising data with a personal computer - costs another \u00a328, it is still \u00a320 cheaper than a comparable 2MB Visor with free USB cradle. Read this! Microsoft has introduced a version of its Reader software, familiar from Windows CE 3-based PocketPCs, for desktop PCs. It can now be downloaded free from at www.microsoft.com/reader. The launch is part of an \"eBook initiative\" involving Barnesandnoble.com, the bookseller, which will sell 2,000 titles in the Microsoft format, adding about 150 titles every week. See www.bn.com/ebook. Barnes &amp; Noble already supports the Rocket eBook handheld, and offers free Glassbook Reader software for Windows. (JS)",
