      "bodyText": "The Guardian is to back a legal challenge to the 300-year-old law banning Roman Catholics and other non-Protestants from succession to the British throne, on the grounds that it clashes with the Human Rights Act and should be reinterpreted or removed from the statute book. Leading human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC believes the Act of Settlement 1701 may be affected by the European convention on human rights, which became part of UK law two months ago when the Human Rights Act came into force. The challenge to the Act of Settlement coincides with an editorial in the paper which argues for a referendum on the future of the monarchy . The act, passed at a time of widespread fear of Catholics, lays down that only Protestant heirs of Princess Sophia, granddaughter of James I, may take the British throne. Neither Catholics, nor those who marry a Catholic, nor those born out of wedlock, may remain in the line of succession. The act remains the crucial cornerstone of the British constitution, exercising an extraordinary hold over the monarchy and imposing limitations designed to tackle the imperatives of a political crisis at the dawn of the 18th century. But it is scarcely relevant to the 21st. Because of it, dozens of people have been barred from taking their place in the order of succession (the list appears on page 21). Since many of them are German, the Guardian has placed an advertisement in the Suddeutsche Zeitung asking them to join the action to reclaim their birthright. Sons also take precedence over daughters and the right of succession belongs to the eldest son. The act institutionalises religious discrimination and male primogeniture. The Human Rights Act gives UK judges power for the first time to reinterpret statutes to make them compatible \"so far as possible\" with the European convention. Mr Robertson considers it may be \"possible\" for the courts to read the Act of Settlement's language in a way which avoids discrimination against women and some religious faiths but the \"express virulence\" of the act's anti-Catholic language could only be removed by legislation. If judges find it impossible to reword the statute, the Human Rights Act allows them to make a \"declaration of incompatibility\". This leaves the statute in force but puts pressure on the government to reform it, since the UK has signed up to the convention and pledged that it will comply with convention rights. The Guardian argues in an editorial today that in the new millennium Britain should be given the choice whether to keep the royal family or to become a republic. Today and over the next few days the paper is running a number of articles advocating republicanism, despite another outdated statute, the Treason Felony Act 1848, which threatens anyone doing so with deportation \"for the term of his or her natural life\". The paper's editor, Alan Rusbridger, wrote last week to the attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, asking for an assurance that he will not be prosecuted, given that he has no intention of advocating overthrow of the monarchy by force. In his letter, he argued that the Treason Felony Act breaches article 10 of the European convention, the right to freedom of expression. He suggested the attorney general might ask the high court to reinterpret the Treason Felony Act so that only calls to overthrow the monarchy by violence would be an offence. He offered the paper's support in the application. Lord Williams replied: \"I hope you understand that Neither David Calvert-Smith [the director of public prosecutions] nor I can give you an assurance regarding whether or not a prosecution or other action will be taken.

The Guardian believes the Act of Settlement violates article 9 of the convention, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. In addition, it breaches article 1 of protocol 1, the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions - in this case the banned descendants' place in the line of succession - and article 14, banning discrimination in relation to any convention right. Not only are Catholics banned from succession, but the sovereign must be in communion with the Church of England, must swear to preserve the church, and to uphold the Protestant line of succession. This appears to discriminate against other faiths, including Jews, Muslims and Hindus. At her coronation in 1953, the Queen pledged to maintain and preserve the church's doctrine, worship and discipline. In December 1999 the Scottish parliament backed unanimously a motion spearheaded by the Scottish National party to abolish the Act of Settlement. The debate was initiated by Lord Hamilton - Tory whip in the parliament - who wrote to Tony Blair asking him to lift the \"anachronistic\" act. Soon after the Scottish vote, the Archbishop of York, David Hope, called for the act to be amended to allow the heir to the throne to marry a Catholic.

      "body": "<p>The Disability Discrimination Act (DDA), which arrived on the statute books five years ago this month, has given unenforceable rights to people with disabilities, claims a new report which calls on government to change the mechanisms for tackling discrimination. </p> <p>The complexity and exorbitant cost of bringing cases in the county court for discrimination in the provision of goods, services, facilities and premises makes it virtually impossible for disabled people to enforce their rights in these areas, concludes The Price of Justice, produced by the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB). </p> <p>Since the DDA came into force in 1996, more than 5,000 cases claiming discrimination at work have been taken to employment tribunals. In contrast, the RNIB knows of only 25 cases claiming discrimination in the provision of goods, services and facilities. </p> <p>Since there is no evidence that disabled people face more discrimination at work than in the rest of their lives, the report attributes the disparity to the different ways that parts of the DDA are enforced. Employment cases go to employment tribunals - where it costs nothing to bring a claim and the risks of having costs awarded against an applicant are negligible. In contrast, claims against a shop manager for verbally abusing a disabled person, or a company for failing to produce bills in braille, would have to go through the county courts - an often complicated, costly process said by the RNIB to put most people off at the first hurdle. </p> <p>In one case - brought against Margaret Hodge, minister for disabled people, for failing to send out in braille a copy of a disability rights task force report - the claimant withdrew because she was worried she might face huge bills. </p> <p>\"Disabled people are deterred from taking claims because the system is so complex and they could face enormous costs if they lose,\" says the report's author, Catherine Casserley, RNIB legal officer. As very few county court judges have ever dealt with a disability discrimination case or received any awareness training, she argues, the odds are stacked against the claimant. </p> <p>If disabled people's rights are to mean more than the paper they are written on, says the RNIB, the government should allow employment tribunals to deal with cases involving goods, services, facilities and premises. But the Department for Education and Employment says it is \"neither appropriate nor sensible\" to extend the remit of employment tribunals. \"These cases go beyond the expertise of employment tribunals,\" it says. \"Judges and magistrates are receiving disability training and will become more accustomed to the act.\" </p> <p>However, the disability rights commission (DRC), the independent body created alongside the DDA to promote the rights of disabled people, acknowledges there is a problem with the county courts. Next month, the commission will introduce a conciliation service designed to tackle discrimination cases outside the courtroom. </p> <p>The DRC is also working to challenge prejudice by raising awareness of disabled issues among the general public. Next week, Tony Blair is due to launch a short film, Talk, as the centrepiece of the commission's first major campaign, Action Speaks Louder Than Words. </p> <p>In Talk, the main character, played by television actor Jonathan Kerrigan, has his negative preconceptions of disability shattered when he goes on a date with a girl who turns out to be in a wheelchair. She takes him to a nightclub full of people with disabilities, where he finds he is the minority in a disability-friendly world. </p> <p>Bert Massie, chair of the DRC, says: \"Using a dramatic film storyline is a deliberate departure from traditional campaigns on disability issues. Public appeals for greater understanding of disability are often well received, but rarely translate into specific action.\"</p>",

The complexity and exorbitant cost of bringing cases in the county court for discrimination in the provision of goods, services, facilities and premises makes it virtually impossible for disabled people to enforce their rights in these areas, concludes The Price of Justice, produced by the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB). Since the DDA came into force in 1996, more than 5,000 cases claiming discrimination at work have been taken to employment tribunals. In contrast, the RNIB knows of only 25 cases claiming discrimination in the provision of goods, services and facilities. Since there is no evidence that disabled people face more discrimination at work than in the rest of their lives, the report attributes the disparity to the different ways that parts of the DDA are enforced. Employment cases go to employment tribunals - where it costs nothing to bring a claim and the risks of having costs awarded against an applicant are negligible. In contrast, claims against a shop manager for verbally abusing a disabled person, or a company for failing to produce bills in braille, would have to go through the county courts - an often complicated, costly process said by the RNIB to put most people off at the first hurdle. In one case - brought against Margaret Hodge, minister for disabled people, for failing to send out in braille a copy of a disability rights task force report - the claimant withdrew because she was worried she might face huge bills. \"Disabled people are deterred from taking claims because the system is so complex and they could face enormous costs if they lose,\" says the report's author, Catherine Casserley, RNIB legal officer. As very few county court judges have ever dealt with a disability discrimination case or received any awareness training, she argues, the odds are stacked against the claimant. If disabled people's rights are to mean more than the paper they are written on, says the RNIB, the government should allow employment tribunals to deal with cases involving goods, services, facilities and premises. But the Department for Education and Employment says it is \"neither appropriate nor sensible\" to extend the remit of employment tribunals. \"These cases go beyond the expertise of employment tribunals,\" it says. \"Judges and magistrates are receiving disability training and will become more accustomed to the act.\" However, the disability rights commission (DRC), the independent body created alongside the DDA to promote the rights of disabled people, acknowledges there is a problem with the county courts. Next month, the commission will introduce a conciliation service designed to tackle discrimination cases outside the courtroom. The DRC is also working to challenge prejudice by raising awareness of disabled issues among the general public. Next week, Tony Blair is due to launch a short film, Talk, as the centrepiece of the commission's first major campaign, Action Speaks Louder Than Words. In Talk, the main character, played by television actor Jonathan Kerrigan, has his negative preconceptions of disability shattered when he goes on a date with a girl who turns out to be in a wheelchair. She takes him to a nightclub full of people with disabilities, where he finds he is the minority in a disability-friendly world. Bert Massie, chair of the DRC, says: \"Using a dramatic film storyline is a deliberate departure from traditional campaigns on disability issues. Public appeals for greater understanding of disability are often well received, but rarely translate into specific action.\"",

Harriet Harman, a former social security secretary and the MP for Camberwell and Peckham, said police were deserting her borough, forced out by central London property prices. The only hope of recruiting and retaining them was for the council to offer them new houses, even if it meant forcing out other tenants. \"It is controversial because it means you are reducing the number of homes available, but I think we have to have police living in the community,\" she said. \"We can't recruit police without sorting out the housing issue - but we also need this to regenerate society. \"People feel safer when they have police living on their estate, and they are also pleased because they feel that if police live among them, they are totally in tune with their issues.\" Ms Harman's call came after the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, warned of an inner city policing crisis, with London having a 3,000 shortfall. In Southwark, the borough in which Damilola was fatally stabbed, the quota of 800 officers is 46 down. In an area where the average cost of a terraced house is \u00a3185,000, police, in common with nurses and teachers, can no longer afford to buy or rent in the private sector on salaries which start at \u00a323,000 including a housing allowance of \u00a33,327, Ms Harman said. The problem has been exacerbated by the previous government's decision, in 1994, to sell off police housing stock and freeze the housing allowance. \"They find they are earning enough to buy in a suburb and then they start to question why they should travel into central London when they can earn the same amount and do easier work policing near their home,\" she warned. She added that the home secretary, Jack Straw, should back the move. But Glen Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, last night warned it would prove unpopular with police, who felt they needed to live outside areas they patrolled, for their own protection. Touring the half-demolished north Peckham estate where Damilola bled to death, Ms Harman said its inhabitants were increasingly carrying knives as status symbols in a community where their chances of good jobs were consistently curtailed by discrimination. \"There is clearly a sense that this is an unequal society where you are blocked by the colour of your skin, and there is a feeling that you achieve status not by getting a degree or by qualifications but by having a knife,\" she said. The growing problem of knife carrying appeared to have developed since children on Peckham's five neighbouring estates had seen their well-educated immigrant parents unable to put their degrees to good use in London. \"Three quarters of the African cab drivers in Peckham have degrees. So how can their children believe their education is worth striving for?\" Ms Harman said. \"It is in this atmosphere that some carry knives and turn to crime.\" The solution, she added, might lie, in increased resources for Peckham's schools, which, in the case of the Oliver Goldsmith which Damilola attended, had one of the lowest scores in national league tables, with only one in four of its 11-year-olds gaining the expected standard in English. In the meantime, parents on the Peckham estate were trying to rectify the problems themselves - either by sending children back home to the West Indies or Africa to be educated, or by dispatching them to a private, Christian Fellowship school on the estate that they could ill afford.",

The health and social care modernisation bill will legislate to push forward several NHS plan commitments, including the creation of care trusts to allow the merger of health and social services. From April next year, it will also support a National Health Performance Fund worth up to \u00a3500m a year by 2003-04, which will reward NHS trusts that are performing well. The bill will confirm that the NHS will pay for nursing care costs in homes for the elderly, while a separate bill will widen the range of health professionals allowed to prescribe drugs. The government's war on cancer and smoking gets a boost in the form of a separate bill to ban the promotion and advertising of tobacco. Legislation to improve access to learning for disabled people, and to extend the functions of the Children's Commissioner for Wales, are also flagged up in the speech. The National Health Performance Fund will provide \u00a35m for each health authority area to be distributed to trusts as a \"reward\" for progress. Access to the cash would depend on a \"traffic light\" system. The best performing \"green\" organisations would have an automatic right to payments while others judged as \"yellow\" and \"red\" would have to agree plans or have their spending supervised. The modernisation bill will enable care trusts to be created. These will be single bodies responsible for delivering primary health care, community health services and social care for older people. Ministers believe care trusts will firmly establish joint working between health and social care. They expect to launch the first trusts next year. A new programme of public-private partnerships - similar to that already used to build hospitals - is planned to finance primary care facilities such as GP surgeries. Priority will be given to those areas, such as inner cities, where primary care services are most in need of expansion. An equity stake company called NHS Lift (NHS Local Improvement Finance Trust) will unlock up to \u00a31bn of investment, leading to the refurbishment of up to 3,000 family doctors' premises by 2004. The speech confirms the NHS will be responsible for paying for nursing care in nursing homes. In future, people assessed as needing nursing care will not have to pay for the services of registered nurses in homes. The legislation will also extend the scope of the direct payments scheme, whereby local authorities make direct payments to individuals to enable them to buy their own care. Another change will extend prescribing rights to a wider range of health professionals. Currently, only doctors, dentists and certain specified health visitors and midwives are able to prescribe drugs. New legislation will be introduced to implement the main recommendations of a government review which accepted nurses should have more freedom to prescribe medicines. It also called for other professionals such as chiropodists, physiotherapists and pharmacists to be given the right to prescribe. Under the proposals, the 1968 Medicines Act will be amended to designate new groups of prescribers and limit or specify the medicines they can prescribe. An advisory body will be set up to consider whether prescribing rights should be granted to any additional groups of health professionals.",

      "bodyText": "In Knowsley telephones have played an integral part in the development of the council's one-stop-shop service since 1994; in Brent a relaunched call centre is a key ingredient in its aim to offer 24-hour council services and the new Liverpool Direct number expects to receive more than 4m calls a year. It may be the internet and web technology that grabs all the prominent headlines, but in the end it is likely to be a simple phone call to your local council that will matter most when it comes to connecting the drive for improved public services with the people who use them. Call centres are already changing the way some local authorities work, and are likely to figure prominently in the way many more respond to pressures to change the way they deliver services to their communities. Tony Blair and the Cabinet Office may be promoting a target of 2005 for all public services to be available online or electronically. But as a series of recent reports have shown, the closer you are to the day to day problems of actual service delivery, the more real the obstacles are. Most councils have websites and encourage greater use of email as a means of communication, but as the IT Trends 2000/1 report published by the Society of Information Technology Management (Socitm) acknowledges, there is still only a \"patchy or poor understanding\" about how best to use the technology. In contrast to this uncertainty, Socitm found: \"There is considerable interest in call centre technology and customer relationship management. Very few authorities have a call centre at present but 63% said they expect to introduce one over the next year or so.\" The great advantage of the telephone is its widespread availability and relative ease of use, the lack of major skill barriers and its availability to a greater cross section of people from all ages and social-economic class. However rapid the growth of the internet, the telephone is already in more than 90% of all homes and what the Henley Centre dubbed \"teleculture\" is a fact of life for councils. According to the Foundation for Information Technology in Local Government, councils already conduct \"75% or more of their existing contact with citizens via the phone\". Public confidence BT published a study this summer which showed widespread concern that lack of public access to the internet could pose a major barrier to the delivery of e-services and could even exasperate problems of social exclusion. Concerns about a general lack of information technology skills and low levels of the public's confidence in their ability to use new technology were also identified as major problems. The plain fact is, the older you are, the less likely you are to use a touchscreen, interactive television or personal computer to access information, but the more likely you are to feel comfortable using a telephone. Even in this high tech age, it seems people still value the opportunity of talking to other people when they want to find something out. This was also a point made in an \"Embracing Technology\" study by the online bank Egg and research company Mori, which stressed that even though half the population may soon be using the internet regularly there will still be 29m adults who don't use a PC. A hardcore of 9m vow they never will. For local government these issues have a special resonance in the era of best value, in which councils are charged with securing year-on-year service improvements. Information technology, put to good effect, can offer a solution to transforming service delivery. Since taking up the post of chief executive at Liverpool, David Henshaw has systematically set about transforming the council from \" seaport to e-port\" - from near the bottom in national performance standards to the very top. A former chief executive of Knowsley, where he helped pioneer the development of one stop shops, Mr Henshaw has forged a \u00a3500m partnership deal with BT to establish Liverpool Direct, the biggest consumer contact centre in local government. Liverpool Direct already takes some 25,000 calls a week from the public and by early next year, as the local network of one stop centres expands, it expects to deal with more than 100,000 calls a week. Local people will be able to access council services by telephone and through a range of newer technologies from touchscreens, digital and web television, WAP phones and the internet, but the guiding principle is to integrate both technology and services to make the council more open and customer friendly. \"Instead of separate council departments all working independently in self-protective silos of service and information, we are integrating our approach right across the council,\" says Mr Henshaw who emphasises the longer term aim of making the service \"more pro-active, more response and more relevant\" for the people who use it. Working conditions With some 7,000 call centres employing more than 400,000 people throughout the UK, the sector plays a key role for the private sector, which pioneered much of the early development through the rapid growth of online insurance and financial services. Despite attracting more than their fair share of criticism for being the \"sweatshops\" of a new industrial age, call centres have had to respond positively to problems such as high levels of absenteeism, high staff turnover and complaints about stress and poor working conditions. It is a lesson that has not been lost on local authorities, which have recognised the importance of improved staff training and development. As Anne Marie Stagg from the Call Centre Management Association, explains: \"Achieving customer services excellence is very simple. All you do is give your frontline people freedom to do what they feel is in the best interests of their customers and then train them, encourage them and support them in excercising this freedom. \"Delivering dreadful customer services is often a result of managerial interference and a tendency to restrict frontline people from applying common sense.

      "bodyText": "GPs have warned the government that its proposals to link financial rewards to hospital performance will discriminate against trusts in deprived areas and hamper their attempts to improve. The government signalled its intention in today's Queen's speech to press ahead with its so-called \"traffic light\" system of rating hospital and health authority performance. The proposals, unveiled in the NHS plan in the summer, will grade high-performing NHS bodies as \"green\", average-performing trusts as as \"yellow\", and poorly performing trusts as \"red\". Trusts given a \"red\" classification run the risk of having their management board replaced by special NHS recovery teams, and will have restricted access to a \u00a3500m performance fund. BMA GPs' committee chair John Chisholm said labelling organisations as \"red\" could be \"seriously counterproductive\", would damage staff recruitment and retention and make it more difficult for the hospital to recover. He said he feared that the criteria would discriminate against hospitals in socially-disadvanted areas. The BMA's fears appear to be borne out by an unofficial ranking of health authorities published tomorrow which shows that the majority of poor performing HAs are in deprived inner city areas, noticeably in the north of England. Compiled by John Appleby and Chris Deeming of the independent Kings Fund health think-tank, the rankings use the Department of Health's own methodology to predict how health authorities will be rated. The rankings, which are previewed today by HSJ Online, show that a quarter of health authorities are likely to receive a \"red light\" classification, and that 80% of these are in the north of the country. According to DoH performance critieria, the top ranking authority is Dorset, while the worst performer is Manchester. In all, 70% of health authorities ranked \"green\" are in the south of England. The BMA said it feared too much emphasis was being placed on \"micro-management from the centre\" and that it had yet to be convinced of the fairness of the criteria used to classify hospitals under the traffic light system.",

Downing Street maintained that today's announcements were \"a full programme that shows, unusually, a government gaining momentum in its fourth year, not losing it\". However, there will inevitably bound be speculation that ministers are actually clearing the decks for a spring poll. Today's speech, delivered amid traditional glittering pomp and ceremony from the golden throne in the Lords also confirmed that there will be a free vote on hunting with dogs. Five bills concentrate on the fight against crime. They will provide for: \u00b7 Fixed penalties for offences of disorderly behaviour in public places \u00b7 Police to be able to shut down rowdy pubs and clubs \u00b7 A ban on drinking alcohol in the street \u00b7 Child curfew schemes for those aged nine to 15. The speech reflected Mr Blair's declared determination to tackle \"yob culture\" in Britain, although there was no place for his ill-received \u00a3100 on-the-spot fines. However, there will be new powers for police to seize the assets of criminals, with drug barons being especially targeted. In an attempt to dampen speculation about an early election, the government insisted that the speech provides for a full legislative programme. On health, the government is to shake up funding, making a fund of \u00a3500m available to the best run NHS trusts immediately and to others under strict supervision. There are also plans for public-private partnerships to improve primary health care - such as GP services - particularly in inner cities. More health professionals will be allowed to prescribe drugs and, on long-term care for the elderly, campaigners will be pleased by a pledge that in future the NHS will be responsible for paying nursing care costs in homes.

James delivered his tongue-in-cheek rebuke after the controversial Italian labelled him a \"cretin\" and a \"moron\" in his autobiography. </p> <p>Di Canio claimed that James refused to shake his hands after a match at Upton Park in January, with the Villa keeper still fuming over a \"dive\" the Italian allegedly made to earn a penalty in the Hammers' League Cup defeat to Villa three days earlier. </p> <p>\"This cretin would not shake my hand,\" Di Canio said in the book. \"At the end of the game it is the British way to shake hands, but by turning his back this moron, James, was sticking two fingers up to British sportsmanship. I told him 'You are nothing. You are not a man.'\" </p> <p>But James questioned Di Canio's grasp of the English language in an interview with the the Birmingham Evening Mail today. \"Does this man not know the meaning of a cretin or a moron?\" he asked.</p> <p>\"He clearly doesn't. A cretin suffers from a thyroid deficiency. It comes from an eighteenth century French word and was initially directed at people living in the valleys of the Alps and the Pyrenees. </p> <p>\"In some cases it is said to lead to dwarfism - and I'm 6ft 5ins for heaven's sake.\" </p> <p>James continued: \"And a moron is an adult person with a mental age of between eight and 12 years old. I'm no brainbox, but I think I'm more advanced than that.\" </p> <p>The former Liverpool man then poured scorn over di Canio's reference to sportsmanship with a clear nod to the Italian's infamous push on referee Paul Alcock. </p> <p>\"Di Canio also brands me unsporting which is all very contradictory coming from him. </p> <p>\"Unfortunately, when I was sitting in my lessons at school, he must have been attending his weekly Referees Appreciation Society meetings!\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Aston Villa goalkeeper David James launched his new comedy career today by firing an \"amusing\" riposte in the direction of Paulo di Canio. James delivered his tongue-in-cheek rebuke after the controversial Italian labelled him a \"cretin\" and a \"moron\" in his autobiography. Di Canio claimed that James refused to shake his hands after a match at Upton Park in January, with the Villa keeper still fuming over a \"dive\" the Italian allegedly made to earn a penalty in the Hammers' League Cup defeat to Villa three days earlier. \"This cretin would not shake my hand,\" Di Canio said in the book. \"At the end of the game it is the British way to shake hands, but by turning his back this moron, James, was sticking two fingers up to British sportsmanship. I told him 'You are nothing. You are not a man.'\" But James questioned Di Canio's grasp of the English language in an interview with the the Birmingham Evening Mail today. \"Does this man not know the meaning of a cretin or a moron?\" he asked. \"He clearly doesn't. A cretin suffers from a thyroid deficiency. It comes from an eighteenth century French word and was initially directed at people living in the valleys of the Alps and the Pyrenees. \"In some cases it is said to lead to dwarfism - and I'm 6ft 5ins for heaven's sake.\" James continued: \"And a moron is an adult person with a mental age of between eight and 12 years old. I'm no brainbox, but I think I'm more advanced than that.\" The former Liverpool man then poured scorn over di Canio's reference to sportsmanship with a clear nod to the Italian's infamous push on referee Paul Alcock. \"Di Canio also brands me unsporting which is all very contradictory coming from him. \"Unfortunately, when I was sitting in my lessons at school, he must have been attending his weekly Referees Appreciation Society meetings!\"",

Having seen his team go down to Leeds, Eriksson insisted he wouldn't be leaving his post in Rome earlier than expected. \"I believe I'm going to stay here until the end of the season,\" he said as his pupils clanked around in their sockets. \"I don't think the fans decide whether I go.

The supporters have been used to the club having problems.

      "bodyText": "The Tory leader, William Hague, today accused the government of putting forward \"cosmetic measures\" in the Queen's speech to cut crime. In response to the slim, seven-minute, speech Mr Hague complained that there was \"so little in it\" he was surprised that the Queen had come to Westminster at all. Ministers were hypocritical to claim that they would cut crime with measures such as fixed penalties for disorderly behaviour, a ban on drinking alcohol in the street and child curfew schemes since, said Mr Hague, crime had risen under Labour. The new proposals merely \"parroted\" the contents of the government's first Queen's speech. And in a reversal of one of Tony Blair's own soundbites, Mr Hague said that the prime minister was \"weak\" on crime. On measures to improve state education and the NHS, Mr Hague said the government was \"all spin and no delivery\". In reply, Mr Blair said it was remarkable that Mr Hague \"did not mention the economy\". The prime minister savaged the Tories' record in office, citing cuts in nurses' training, a failure to maintain school buildings and record levels of borrowing. He said crime had doubled under the Conservatives but fallen under Labour. The short Queen's speech has led many to speculate it will be the last before a spring general election. Mr Blair mocked Mr Hague's prospects at the election and quoted a letter misdirected to the Labour chief whip from a senior Tory that said the party should play down its hopes so it could \"claim great progress although we lost\".

      "body": "<p> Sarah was looking forward to seeing her two young children after a hard day's work at the office. But her joy at spending the evening with them turned to dismay when she discovered that her four-year-old daughter, Sally, had been sexually abused. Equally shocking was the revelation that the abuser was her six-year-old son, Nigel. His behaviour emerged only when Sally told her mother she didn't like playing doctors any more. Asked why, she replied: \"I don't like it when Nigel examines me and gives me operations.\" </p> <p>Sadly, Nigel and his sister's case is far from unique. Recent research shows that sexual abuse and inappropriate sexual behaviour between young siblings is far more common than abuse by other family members such as fathers and stepfathers. What is new is that local authorities and child protection charities are starting to concentrate on this area of abuse after more than a decade when adult men have been cast as the villains. </p> <p>In Nigel's case, an investigation by social services found that his mother's previous partner had often been violent towards the whole family and had forced Sarah into sexual behaviour in front of the children. </p> <p>The young boy was assessed and his mother agreed to a pioneering programme of work with Warwickshire's \"sexualised inappropriate behaviour service\" (Sibs). Work took place over the next six months with the family. This involved counselling and help with parent skills for the mother, and joint play work with the children to help them talk through their experience and develop appropriate behaviour. </p> <p>That was 18 months ago. Social services support for the family has now been withdrawn. But Warwickshire social services department is still running Sibs - one of the few local authorities specialising in this area - amid growing recognition that sexual abuse of children by children is one of the most common forms of sexual abuse. </p> <p>Only last month, a report by the NSPCC challenged the widespread belief that fathers are chiefly responsible for sexual abuse of children. A survey of the childhood experiences of 2,869 young people aged 18-24 found that abuse by brothers or stepbrothers was twice as common as that by a father or stepfather. </p> <p>The findings were splashed across the newspapers, and commentators predicted that the findings would trigger a major change in approach to sexual abuse in the family. But probation officers and social workers say awareness of sibling abuse has been growing for years. Interviews with adult sex offenders have revealed a cycle of abuse, with offenders starting their abuse in their early teens after being the victim of sexual or physical assaults. However, experts admit it is only now that therapeutic work with young abusers is being offered as a specialist service. </p> <p>Driven by a real desire to break this predatory pattern of abuse, Andrew Durham, a senior social worker, set up the project in Warwickshire. What began as a joint health and social services initiative has developed into a permanent specialistassessment and treatment service that has been hailed by the government's social services inspectorate as an example of good practice. </p> <p>Figures show the high demand for the service, which works sympathetically with young people to retrain and redirect their sexual behaviour. Between 1998 and 1999, Sibs dealt with 62 cases of sexually inappropriate behaviour and child sexual abuse - ranging from over-sexualised five-year-olds, to sexually abusive 11-year-olds and 14-year-old rapists. Three in four referrals were for children aged 10 and over. Ninety per cent of children referred to the project were boys. Most of the victims were female. </p> <p>The story of Nigel and Sally, in which Nigel tried to simulate sexual intercourse, is drawn from actual cases worked on by Sibs. Most children referred to the project are older. One typical case involved two families where a young teenage boy from one family was found playing \"sexual\" games with a younger boy and girl from another. Interviews revealed the teenager had been using his father's collection of pornography and was being bullied at school. He was given a police caution following his family's agreement to work with Sibs - work which took place over 12 months. The children in the other family were also offered help and support from the local social services children's team. </p> <p>The age of the children referred for help may vary - but most share a vulnerability, according to Mr Durham, who has received an advanced award in social work in recognition of his work on the project. \"Young people who abuse often have very difficult problems in their lives, which they are unable to deal with in the ways most people do,\" he says. \"They often have experiences of being powerless, of being put down. They want to feel more powerful. For boys, in a distorted way, it reinforces their feelings of being male.\" </p> <p>An analysis of cases seen in 1998 shows that 80% of children had family problems. Of these, 54% had been sexually abused, 45% were in care, 28% were physically abused and 42% were emotionally abused. More than half (52%) had problems at school. </p> <p>Cases are referred to Sibs through the police, social services or schools. An assessment is made of the child or young person and of their willingness to work with the project. An assessment of the family is also made and the social worker makes every effort to work with the parents, who may be angry or in denial. Part of the Sibs work involves setting up a network of people, including the family, to support the young person. They are given practical guidelines to help prevent opportunities where the young person might abuse again.If the young person agrees to work with Sibs, a sexual history is taken. Boys who may want a macho image are taught to be assertive, rather than aggressive. </p> <p>A similar approach is taken in Oxfordshire, where the Oxfordshire young abusers' project (Oxyap) has been treating young people for the past four years. It runs alongside the Ark - a separate initiative specialising in treating younger children, run by charity NCH Action For Children. So far this year, Oxyap has had 20 referrals and there is now a waiting list for assessments that can run to several weeks. The project has just been awarded \u00a310,000 government funding which will be used to increase staff and reduce waiting times. </p> <p>Charities such as ChildLine, which every year receives thousands of calls from victims of child abuse, want to see more local authorities offering these specialist services. \"Research shows you can identify children who are abusing sexually and may go on to become an adult abuser, so positive work like this is very helpful,\" says Hereward Harrison, ChildLine's director of policy. \"The younger they are identified the better. This can stop the horror and the devastation that comes from a career of abuse which ultimately ends with the abuser in prison.\" </p> <p>For Andrew Durham, the message is simple. \"If you can work with a person and change their development, you could be preventing quite a large number of future victims,\" he says. \"Our work has only just begun. There will continue to be thousands more victims until every social services departments includes these preventative measures in their child protection policies.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Sibs is on 01926-813110; Oxyap is on 01865-221201.</p>",

Of these, 54% had been sexually abused, 45% were in care, 28% were physically abused and 42% were emotionally abused. More than half (52%) had problems at school. Cases are referred to Sibs through the police, social services or schools. An assessment is made of the child or young person and of their willingness to work with the project. An assessment of the family is also made and the social worker makes every effort to work with the parents, who may be angry or in denial. Part of the Sibs work involves setting up a network of people, including the family, to support the young person. They are given practical guidelines to help prevent opportunities where the young person might abuse again.If the young person agrees to work with Sibs, a sexual history is taken. Boys who may want a macho image are taught to be assertive, rather than aggressive. A similar approach is taken in Oxfordshire, where the Oxfordshire young abusers' project (Oxyap) has been treating young people for the past four years. It runs alongside the Ark - a separate initiative specialising in treating younger children, run by charity NCH Action For Children. So far this year, Oxyap has had 20 referrals and there is now a waiting list for assessments that can run to several weeks. The project has just been awarded \u00a310,000 government funding which will be used to increase staff and reduce waiting times. Charities such as ChildLine, which every year receives thousands of calls from victims of child abuse, want to see more local authorities offering these specialist services. \"Research shows you can identify children who are abusing sexually and may go on to become an adult abuser, so positive work like this is very helpful,\" says Hereward Harrison, ChildLine's director of policy. \"The younger they are identified the better. This can stop the horror and the devastation that comes from a career of abuse which ultimately ends with the abuser in prison.\" For Andrew Durham, the message is simple. \"If you can work with a person and change their development, you could be preventing quite a large number of future victims,\" he says. \"Our work has only just begun. There will continue to be thousands more victims until every social services departments includes these preventative measures in their child protection policies.\" \u0095 Sibs is on 01926-813110; Oxyap is on 01865-221201.",

After all, if they did, they would have no qualms about providing the guarantee, the consumer groups say. The biggest day to day problem with internet banking appears to be access. You might find it difficult to get on to the internet at certain times of day - weekday evenings are the most popular. The speed with which you access your account will also depend on the amount of memory your computer has or the speed of your modem. And if your computer crashes completely you will have to resort to the telephone or branch until it is back up. In addition, your bank may need to shut down its website for maintenance from time to time. Here, the existing banks have the advantage over the standalone banks, as telephone support is free and most have branches on the high street. High street banks also have the advantage of being able to offer face to face support and advice, which some people find useful If you intend to access your account through a company computer, you may need to ask your system administrator first, especially if your company operates a firewall. Some of the banks cannot operate on Apple Macintosh computers, so check that yours is compatible. You will also need to have the relevant operating system, typically Windows 95, 98 or NT, and the right system browser, usually Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 or above or Netscape Navigator 4 or above.

My government will ensure the continued economic stability which has enabled it to increase the resources available for education, health, transport, and police services. My government will reflect these policies in its Finance Bill.</p> <p>This is my government's fourth legislative programme. My government's main Bills for the coming Session will focus on improving public services and cutting crime.</p> <p>My government also plans other major Bills and other significant initiatives, particularly in secondary education with the creation of more specialist schools, urban school reform and improved teaching in the early years of secondary education.</p> <p>My government is determined to combat all aspects of crime to protect all members of our society. My government will introduce legislation to modernise and improve law enforcement by, for example, tackling disorderly conduct.

This will enable more information to be obtained to prevent fraud and will provide power to withdraw or reduce benefits where a person has twice been convicted of benefit fraud.</p> <p>My government remains committed to the founding principles of the National Health Service. My government's NHS Plan showed how it would take forward further reform of health services to improve standards. Legislation will be introduced to support many of the commitments in the Plan, in particular to improve the performance of the NHS. The legislation will also take forward my government's response to the Royal Commission on Long Term Care for the Elderly.</p> <p>A Bill will be brought forward to ban the advertising and promotion of tobacco products.</p> <p>My government continues to attach the highest importance to improving education. It has already secured a number of changes to the law to further this end, including legislation to reform the training of teachers, to secure improved school standards and to create the Learning and Skills Councils. My government will introduce a Bill to improve the framework for meeting special educational needs and access to learning for disabled people. During the new Session, my government will continue to work to improve standards in education.</p> <p>Legislation will be introduced to extend the functions of the Children's Commissioner for Wales, to provide better protection for children in Wales.</p> <p>A Bill will be introduced to increase the effectiveness of the power to reduce regulatory burdens by removing inappropriate and over-complex regulation.</p> <p>Legislation will be brought forward to ease the process of buying and selling homes, and to improve the protection given to homeless people. Progress will also be made on the purchase of freeholds by leaseholders, and on commonhold, a new form of tenure for flatowners.</p> <p>Members of the House of Commons,</p> <p>Estimates for the Public Service will be laid before you.</p> <p>My Lords and member of the House of Commons,</p> <p>A Bill will be introduced to enable a free vote to take place on the future of hunting with dogs.</p> <p>My government has appointed Lord Cullen to head an Inquiry into safety on our railways. A Bill will be drafted to provide for safer travel on the railways, in the air, at sea and on the roads, and will take forward proposals for revitalising health and safety at work.</p> <p>A draft Bill will be published to improve the transparency of export controls and to establish their purpose.</p> <p>In Northern Ireland, my government will continue to work closely with the political parties and the Irish government to secure the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. A Bill will be published in draft on the implementation of the recommendations of the review of the Criminal Justice System in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>My government is committed to making devolution in Scotland and Wales work and to continuing the process of decentralising government in the interests of all the people in the United Kingdom.</p> <p>A Bill will be introduced to maintain the legislation relating to the Armed Forces for the next five years.</p> <p>Other measures will be laid before you.</p> <p>My Lords and member of the House of Commons,</p> <p>The Duke of Edinburgh and I look forward to our State Visit to Norway.</p> <p>My government will continue to work with our partners to shape the future of the European Union. It will work for rapid progress on the enlargement negotiations, and for reform of the institutions of the European Union to prepare them for a wider membership.</p> <p>My government will continue to ensure that NATO remains the foundation of Britain's defence and security.

      "bodyText": "My Lords and members of the Commons. My government will continue to pursue its central economic objective of high and stable levels of growth and employment. My government will ensure the continued economic stability which has enabled it to increase the resources available for education, health, transport, and police services. My government will reflect these policies in its Finance Bill. This is my government's fourth legislative programme. My government's main Bills for the coming Session will focus on improving public services and cutting crime. My government also plans other major Bills and other significant initiatives, particularly in secondary education with the creation of more specialist schools, urban school reform and improved teaching in the early years of secondary education. My government is determined to combat all aspects of crime to protect all members of our society. My government will introduce legislation to modernise and improve law enforcement by, for example, tackling disorderly conduct. Legislation will be introduced to regulate the private security industry. A Bill will be introduced to cut vehicle crime, reduce opportunities to dispose of stolen vehicles, and extend the time limit for prosecution for vehicle theft. A Bill will be published in draft to increase powers against money laundering and make it easier to recover the proceeds of crime. The Bill to give Courts themselves the power to decide whether certain defendants should be tried by jury or by magistrates, will be re-introduced. Legislation will also be brought forward to reduce benefit fraud. This will enable more information to be obtained to prevent fraud and will provide power to withdraw or reduce benefits where a person has twice been convicted of benefit fraud. My government remains committed to the founding principles of the National Health Service. My government's NHS Plan showed how it would take forward further reform of health services to improve standards. Legislation will be introduced to support many of the commitments in the Plan, in particular to improve the performance of the NHS. The legislation will also take forward my government's response to the Royal Commission on Long Term Care for the Elderly. A Bill will be brought forward to ban the advertising and promotion of tobacco products. My government continues to attach the highest importance to improving education. It has already secured a number of changes to the law to further this end, including legislation to reform the training of teachers, to secure improved school standards and to create the Learning and Skills Councils. My government will introduce a Bill to improve the framework for meeting special educational needs and access to learning for disabled people. During the new Session, my government will continue to work to improve standards in education. Legislation will be introduced to extend the functions of the Children's Commissioner for Wales, to provide better protection for children in Wales. A Bill will be introduced to increase the effectiveness of the power to reduce regulatory burdens by removing inappropriate and over-complex regulation. Legislation will be brought forward to ease the process of buying and selling homes, and to improve the protection given to homeless people. Progress will also be made on the purchase of freeholds by leaseholders, and on commonhold, a new form of tenure for flatowners. Members of the House of Commons, Estimates for the Public Service will be laid before you. My Lords and member of the House of Commons, A Bill will be introduced to enable a free vote to take place on the future of hunting with dogs. My government has appointed Lord Cullen to head an Inquiry into safety on our railways. A Bill will be drafted to provide for safer travel on the railways, in the air, at sea and on the roads, and will take forward proposals for revitalising health and safety at work. A draft Bill will be published to improve the transparency of export controls and to establish their purpose. In Northern Ireland, my government will continue to work closely with the political parties and the Irish government to secure the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. A Bill will be published in draft on the implementation of the recommendations of the review of the Criminal Justice System in Northern Ireland. My government is committed to making devolution in Scotland and Wales work and to continuing the process of decentralising government in the interests of all the people in the United Kingdom. A Bill will be introduced to maintain the legislation relating to the Armed Forces for the next five years. Other measures will be laid before you. My Lords and member of the House of Commons, The Duke of Edinburgh and I look forward to our State Visit to Norway. My government will continue to work with our partners to shape the future of the European Union. It will work for rapid progress on the enlargement negotiations, and for reform of the institutions of the European Union to prepare them for a wider membership. My government will continue to ensure that NATO remains the foundation of Britain's defence and security. My government will continue to work to make the United Nations Security Council more effective and representative. It will support efforts to improve the United Nations' capacity to undertake peace keeping operations. A White Paper will be published outlining how my government will work to shape the forces of globalization to benefit the world's poor. My government believes that those who commit crimes against humanity should be brought to justice. It will introduce a Bill to enable the UK to ratify the statute of the International Criminal Court. My Lords and member of the House of Commons, I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your counsels.

      "body": "<p>A snowy night in Hull. Maria, a 14-year-old schoolgirl, stands on a hill shivering. In her arms she holds Robbie, her newborn baby, wrapped in her school coat and named after Robbie Williams. She didn't realise that babies came out before they were fully grown, but of one thing she is sure: she cannot take Robbie home. </p> <p>She knows because she has worked it all out. She sees her world for what it is and knows that it is not good enough for her baby. Her mother is the \"Queen of Misery\" and her father is \"King Bastard Kong\". She hates the way he has stopped loving her mother and enjoys saying no to her when she asks for something nice. </p> <p>Maria knows that if she takes her baby home, suddenly everyone will start asking questions and looking for someone to blame. She knows the other kids at school will call her a \"slag\", and the press will hound her parents and want to know why she kept it a secret. </p> <p>Maria has had her baby alone. She cut the cord with her dad's penknife. She finds the skip outside the old church that they are turning into a pub and she lays Robbie down to sleep on an old mattress. She tells him who she is and the reason she can't keep him. Then she puts on her favourite lipstick, the one that tastes of toffee apples, and kisses him on his little nose and cheeks. She leaves him her \"toffee apple kisses\". </p> <p>When she gets home, she puts on her headphones and listens to Robbie Williams singing about loving angels. She is just loving her Robbie instead. </p> <p>The newspapers have a field day with the story: Baby Dumped in Skip. Maria's mother tells her it is too sad to bear, that whoever the mother is, she must be missing him something terrible and yet Maria still cannot tell her the truth. Her dad shouts at the telly and says she must be a slag and the poor bastard is better off without her. Maria has to go to the bathroom and put toilet roll in her bra because her milk is coming. </p> <p>A cold November day in Hull. Lucy, my teenage daughter, is playing the part of Maria. We are standing on top of Park Street Bridge in gale force winds. The rain lashes at Lucy's face as she shouts, spits and shivers out her lines: \"I know me mam was thinking about his balls ... I know she wants to burst 'em, squash, stamp and rip 'em apart like he does her heart, 'cos she's sick of his face. She's sick of his body and she's sick of his mind, she's sick of his hate and anger and his big bastard ways ...\" As she finishes, a train passes under the bridge and a seagull cries overhead. This is why I love radio: a scene like that comes at you from all directions and is so visual. </p> <p>My heart felt as though it would burst with pride: we all realised why it would have been really tricky for any young actress to have done this piece. I wrote it in reaction to a series of \"schoolgirl mum shock\" headlines: the sort of stories that seem to focus on statistics rather than individuals, so remote from all the heartache that must have been involved. I wrote Crush with Lucy in mind because that gave me licence to dig deeper and tell it like it is - from what it felt like when Maria's boyfriend, Darren, shoved his thing in her, to wanting to kill her dad for making her mum go down on him when he was pissed. </p> <p>You may be thinking that I was asking my daughter to do something other mothers would not allow their daughters to do; maybe you are right. My daughter, Lucy, is 17. We live in Hull, and she studies performing arts at Wyke sixth-form college. Ours is not a perfect relationship. It hasn't always been easy. We have struggled financially for most of her life and that is because I am a writer. She understands that it is more of a calling than a job, but it is not always easy living with a mother who lives in her head. We bicker and annoy each other like most mothers and daughters, but we also laugh and she knows I love her to pieces. </p> <p>I have always written raw, realistic material; Lucy helps by reading my work out loud so that I can hear it off the page. She has read every kind of part, from a prostitute to a refugee child. She knows the rhythms and the reasons behind my sentences. Living in Hull, we see and hear most things and I have never tried to hide the hard bits from Lucy. Suddenly hearing my daughter easily falling into character made me think, \"My God, she really knows this world so well. What else does she know that she's not telling me?\" </p> <p>But for all our honesty with each other, Lucy has told me that every teenage kid at some time does some thing really bad that they can't tell their parents about. Why? Usually because they know it will get them into big trouble or that their parents won't understand: they will overreact and ground them, blame their friends and never trust them again. When Lucy confesses to doing something she shouldn't have, it usually means that it has become too big for her to cope with. </p> <p>When I ask her why she has left it so long to tell me, she always says the same thing: you're so busy; or I know you've got problems of your own, the bills, the deadlines ... Teenagers are old enough to observe our lives and worry about us as much as we do about them. </p> <p>Lucy told me once that I was weak because I was depressed. I told her that I was finding life tough. She responded by telling me that a close friend of hers was still having nightmares after having witnessed a woman jump from a high-rise flat and land virtually at his feet; that a 15-year-old boy from her school was thinking about running away from the hostel he had been put in because his mother was a drug addict; that her best friend was at this minute sitting outside a maternity wing because a 16-year-old girl he had had a fling with was having a baby and she thinks he might be the dad; and that her own boyfriend, who is 17, had to leave the army earlier this year because he was bullied. </p> <p>We get so caught up in \"adult\" problems that we forget young people have real problems too. Lucy tells me things about other teenagers that scare me, so how hard must it be for her? Perhaps that is why it wasn't hard to persuade her to perform this piece. She never questioned anything that was close to the bone: she knows it reflects how many teenagers think; she says most drama about teenagers only skims the surface. </p> <p>I believe that by listening to their stories I can help to give young people a voice. That way we can begin to know what they see, what they feel and how scared they really are. </p> <p>\u0095 Gill Adams's play Crush - one in Radio 3's series of new dramas, The Wire - will be broadcast on December 9 at 10.45pm.</p>",

Maria's mother tells her it is too sad to bear, that whoever the mother is, she must be missing him something terrible and yet Maria still cannot tell her the truth. Her dad shouts at the telly and says she must be a slag and the poor bastard is better off without her. Maria has to go to the bathroom and put toilet roll in her bra because her milk is coming. A cold November day in Hull. Lucy, my teenage daughter, is playing the part of Maria. We are standing on top of Park Street Bridge in gale force winds. The rain lashes at Lucy's face as she shouts, spits and shivers out her lines: \"I know me mam was thinking about his balls ... I know she wants to burst 'em, squash, stamp and rip 'em apart like he does her heart, 'cos she's sick of his face. She's sick of his body and she's sick of his mind, she's sick of his hate and anger and his big bastard ways ...\" As she finishes, a train passes under the bridge and a seagull cries overhead. This is why I love radio: a scene like that comes at you from all directions and is so visual. My heart felt as though it would burst with pride: we all realised why it would have been really tricky for any young actress to have done this piece. I wrote it in reaction to a series of \"schoolgirl mum shock\" headlines: the sort of stories that seem to focus on statistics rather than individuals, so remote from all the heartache that must have been involved. I wrote Crush with Lucy in mind because that gave me licence to dig deeper and tell it like it is - from what it felt like when Maria's boyfriend, Darren, shoved his thing in her, to wanting to kill her dad for making her mum go down on him when he was pissed. You may be thinking that I was asking my daughter to do something other mothers would not allow their daughters to do; maybe you are right. My daughter, Lucy, is 17. We live in Hull, and she studies performing arts at Wyke sixth-form college. Ours is not a perfect relationship. It hasn't always been easy. We have struggled financially for most of her life and that is because I am a writer. She understands that it is more of a calling than a job, but it is not always easy living with a mother who lives in her head. We bicker and annoy each other like most mothers and daughters, but we also laugh and she knows I love her to pieces. I have always written raw, realistic material; Lucy helps by reading my work out loud so that I can hear it off the page. She has read every kind of part, from a prostitute to a refugee child. She knows the rhythms and the reasons behind my sentences. Living in Hull, we see and hear most things and I have never tried to hide the hard bits from Lucy. Suddenly hearing my daughter easily falling into character made me think, \"My God, she really knows this world so well. What else does she know that she's not telling me?\" But for all our honesty with each other, Lucy has told me that every teenage kid at some time does some thing really bad that they can't tell their parents about. Why? Usually because they know it will get them into big trouble or that their parents won't understand: they will overreact and ground them, blame their friends and never trust them again. When Lucy confesses to doing something she shouldn't have, it usually means that it has become too big for her to cope with. When I ask her why she has left it so long to tell me, she always says the same thing: you're so busy; or I know you've got problems of your own, the bills, the deadlines ... Teenagers are old enough to observe our lives and worry about us as much as we do about them. Lucy told me once that I was weak because I was depressed. I told her that I was finding life tough. She responded by telling me that a close friend of hers was still having nightmares after having witnessed a woman jump from a high-rise flat and land virtually at his feet; that a 15-year-old boy from her school was thinking about running away from the hostel he had been put in because his mother was a drug addict; that her best friend was at this minute sitting outside a maternity wing because a 16-year-old girl he had had a fling with was having a baby and she thinks he might be the dad; and that her own boyfriend, who is 17, had to leave the army earlier this year because he was bullied. We get so caught up in \"adult\" problems that we forget young people have real problems too. Lucy tells me things about other teenagers that scare me, so how hard must it be for her? Perhaps that is why it wasn't hard to persuade her to perform this piece. She never questioned anything that was close to the bone: she knows it reflects how many teenagers think; she says most drama about teenagers only skims the surface. I believe that by listening to their stories I can help to give young people a voice. That way we can begin to know what they see, what they feel and how scared they really are. \u0095 Gill Adams's play Crush - one in Radio 3's series of new dramas, The Wire - will be broadcast on December 9 at 10.45pm.",

As a mother of four, I would be the last to tell a parent how to discipline children. Children need to know what naughty behaviour is, but just labelling them won't explain it. A little explanation goes a long way and counting to 10 before you open your mouth always helps. Verdict: Yes Nick Putz Performer and children's entertainer When I am doing workshops or parties with children, some of them do sometimes misbehave. They are always trying to knock me off my stilts. Rather than telling children they are being naughty, I try to create a distraction and encourage them to play with something I do want them to play with rather than something I don't. Because I dress up in very silly clothes, no child would take me seriously as a disciplinarian anyway. If I can make a gag about their behaviour, I find that useful too: distraction and humour are the most useful tools in my armoury. Verdict: Yes",

      "body": "<p>On the morning I decided to kill my mother, time seemed to slow to a halt. A year had sped by in a chaos of emotions, hurtling between hope and despair, love and fear, at disorienting speed. Then came the final diagnosis: terminal cancer, and not long to live. Our world shrank fast as she became increasingly ill and immobile, and time warped as night merged into day and back again, punctuated by long periods of her sleeping silence, pierced by bursts of excruciating, unimaginable pain. </p> <p>There had been moments of terror for us both, but when I made the decision - that she must die and that I must be the one to do it - I was extremely calm. For days, I had watched her body twitch in agony as the dosage of the painkillers she was given proved inadequate. I had argued and pleaded with the doctors and health visitors responsible for her medication and still she wasn't getting what she needed. I had to do something. </p> <p>When I did, time passed in slow motion, quietly. There were no great dramatic gestures, no hopes to grasp at, no future to struggle towards ... just me and my mum in the bedroom that had become our world. The sun was beginning to shine through the curtains and buses had begun to trundle past her window. I stroked her hair. I tried but probably failed to say how much I loved her. Then I pressed the button that killed her. </p> <p>I did love her. In the last few years of her life, we had begun to appreciate each other as women, not simply as mother and daughter. Our roles had blurred, our relationship had shifted: I taught her shopping and she taught me sitcoms. We watched too many episodes of Cheers together, ate too much chocolate and got drunk on strange bottles lurking in her sideboard. She infuriated me; I exasperated her. And we talked for hours at a time. One night, we discussed what we would do were either of us ever in a position of great suffering and no hope. We agreed to \"pull the plug\". </p> <p>It took my mum 24 hours to die from the moment I pressed that button. This simple action boosted the flow of the morphine cocktail that was entering her body via the small syringe pump pinned to her nightie. She slid, or, more accurately, was pushed, into a coma from which she never surfaced. I hope that she died painlessly. </p> <p>But perhaps she did not. I had had to guess the dose that would kill her. A visiting nurse had told me that Mum wasn't allowed more than a certain level of drugs because any more would be lethal. So I had taken that figure and doubled it. Her body stopped arching in pain, her moans subsided and the rictus of agony eased. But perhaps, rather than easing my mother's pain and hastening her death, the dosage swept her into a vortex of paralysis, fear and hallucination. I have no way of knowing. </p> <p>It doesn't help to know that drug-induced terror was nothing new to her. In two different hospitals, as her illness progressed, I had found her hallucinating in silent fear, her fingers locked to the arms of her chair. The few nurses on shift were too busy to notice. When I held her hand, she cried. I complained and was told that her dosage needed \"fine-tuning\"; this consisted of dropping it so dramatically that she lay screeching in pain. I was assured that this was not inadequate care but \"how it had to be\", this seesawing between dementia and searing pain. </p> <p> How it had to be? Once diagnosed as terminal, when there was \"nothing more the hospital could do\", it was suggested my mother enter a hospice. Within 24 hours, she was virtually pain-free and in control, sitting up laughing at her drug-induced antics the day before. She had her personality, her humour, and what was left of her life, back. </p> <p>Not once while there was she allowed to flip into drugged terror and never once was she left to suffer. The staff were dedicated, expert, watchful, respectful. They knew the importance of pain control, dignity, individuality and a good shampoo and set. They talked about life, death, children, funerals, fears, social security forms, memories and aromatherapy. And when people didn't want to talk, they knew how to be silent. Mum rallied so much, she felt well enough to go home to die. </p> <p>Home was where she belonged and where we both wanted her to be. That was where she wanted to die. But it meant a switch from the care of the hospice into the care of her GP's surgery. Don't worry, we were told, all the doctors were skilled in pain control. </p> <p>The first doctor to visit was unsure whether my mother's drugs should be administered intravenously or intramuscularly, or how to set up the syringe pump, or how to work out the dose needed over 12 hours. He miscalculated and it ran out at 4am. Then there was the one who was unwilling to give diamorphine at the dose recommended by the hospice because he thought it \"dangerous\". Dangerous to whom? </p> <p>\"Double effect\" is the term used to describe the action of pain control drugs that are administered to alleviate suffering but which actually hasten death in the process. It is perfectly legal and, according to recent surveys, supported by the majority of GPs. Just hope to God you get one of those. What is the lay person to do in the middle of the night, faced with a dying relative and a doctor unwilling to help? Perhaps he had ethical objections; perhaps it was misplaced fear of prosecution. Yes, he had a problem. But my mother's was bigger. By then, there were no hospice beds available. The pain had to stop and, two days later, I stopped it. </p> <p>It is not the fact that I had to kill her that hurts the most. What is still so raw, and so hard to live with, is the realisation that I need not have killed her, that my well-intentioned but amateurish attempts to give her some dignity in dying were the final acts in a tragic farce. </p> <p>This was not the mercy-killing of someone whose pain was beyond the reach of medical knowledge, as the headline-hitting cases tend to be. This was the killing of a woman whose pain could have been controlled with commonplace drugs and existing expertise. The need to hasten her death would not have arisen had the doctors in charge of her care had the courage, confidence and training to control her suffering. But they didn't. She was not yet 60, and she deserved better. </p> <p>After my mother died, a nurse who came to take away the needles and medicines calculated that a quantity of drugs had been used that could not be accounted for. This was serious: Class A drugs were \"missing\". She told me the police could be called. </p> <p>\"You have to do what you have to do,\" I said. </p> <p>\"We all have to do that sometimes, don't we?\" she replied softly. No more was said. </p> <p>That you will die is a certainty; how you die, in this country, is a lottery. The quality of palliative care depends largely on where you live, where you are looked after and by whom. The doses of morphine administered for pain relief vary hugely, depending on where the patient is being treated. The levels of attention and respect accorded to the dying range from neglectful indifference to expert dedication. </p> <p>Even the law cannot promise uniformity of provision and approach. The test case brought by the late, courageous Annie Lindsell before her death from motor neurone disease in 1997 underlined the legality of \"double effect\" under English law. However, this does not necessarily mean that the doctor treating your relative or friend will want to administer those drugs, will agree to administer them or even know how to administer them effectively. </p> <p>The care of the terminally and chronically ill in this country is a mess. Talk to most people over the age of 30 and they will have a relative or friend who has died in distress or cruel indignity. Care of the dying is a specialist skill, too infrequently undertaken by specialists; the needs of the dying are at the bottom of a very large heap of medical priorities, and there they may remain. </p> <p>No one can ever know how many carers like me attempt, succeed or at least consider the killing of loved ones, but we can be sure we know of only the very tip of a huge iceberg of misery. The numbers affected will rise as life expectancy increases and, with it, the percentage of people look ing after elderly relatives. Yet the situation remains ignored because the dead don't shout, the dead don't vote, and those left behind are usually too numb to complain. </p> <p>Only when more people accept the unpalatable truth that their relative, or even they themselves, could be denied access to adequate pain relief when they are dying, will real changes begin to be made. </p> <p>I watched my mother suffer in a way that broke her heart and mine. And I killed her. In a society with the means to control the pain that fuels such crude acts of compassion, this seems pathetic and barbaric, yet I felt I had no choice. </p> <p>It is not a dilemma I wish my own children to face.</p>",

      "trailText": "<p><strong>4. To Madame de Sade</strong> <br /> <strong> April 18, 1777</strong></p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>4. To Madame de Sade</strong> <br> <strong> April 18, 1777</strong></p> <p>Tis most rightly said, my dear friend, that edifices constructed in a position such as mine are built only on sand, and that all the ideas one forms are naught but illusions, which crumble to dust as soon as they are conceived. Of the six combinations I figured out all by myself, and upon which I based a hope of some enlightenment in the near future, there remains, thanks be to God, not a single one, and your letter of April 14 caused them to disappear the way the sun's rays dissipate the morning dew. 'Tis true that on the other hand I did find in that same letter the comforting sentence telling me that I could be quite sure that I shall not stay here one minute longer than the time necessary. I know nothing on earth so reassuring as this expression, so that if 'tis necessary for me to remain here six months, six months I shall remain. That is charming, and verily, those in charge of guiding your style must perforce congratulate themselves upon the progress you are making in their profound art of sprinkling salt on the wounds of the wretched. Indeed, they have succeeded masterfully. I warn you, however, that 'twill not be long before my head explodes because of the cruel life I am leading. I can see it coming, and I hereby predict that they shall have every reason to repent for having used an excessive dose of severity with me, which is so ill-suited to my character. 'Tis for my own welfare, they maintain. Divine phrase, wherein one recognizes all too clearly the ordinary language of imbecility triumphant. 'Tis for a man's own good that you expose him to maddening conditions, for his own good that you wreck his health, for his own good that you feed him on the tears of despair! So far, I must confess, I've not had the pleasure of understanding or experiencing that kind of well-being ... </p> <p>You are wrong, the fools gravely declare to you: this gives you the chance to think things over. 'Tis true, it does make one think, but would you like to know the one thought this infamous brutality has engendered in me? The thought, deeply engraved in my soul, of fleeing as soon as I am able from a country where a citizen's services count as nothing when it comes to compensating for a momentary lapse, where imprudence is punished as if it were a crime, where a woman, because she is cunning and filled with deceit, finds the secret of enslaving innocence to her caprices, or rather to her commanding and personal interest to bury the veritable crux of the matter; and, far from those whose goal is to harass and annoy, and all their accomplices, of setting off in search of a free country where I can faithfully serve the prince who will provide me with asylum there, and thus may merit from him what I could not obtain in my native land ... justice and to be left in peace. </p> <p>Those, my dear friend, are my sole and unique thoughts, and I aspire to naught but the happy moment when I can put them into effect. We have been misled, you say. Not so ... I assure you that I was not fooled for one minute, and you ought to remember how, just before your room was filled with a pack of rascals - who, without producing any order from the king, had come, or so they claimed, to arrest me on the king's behalf - I told you that I did not trust your mother's reassuring letter and that since it was full of tenderness, one could be sure that her soul was feeding on a diet of deceit. No, my dear friend, no, I may have been surprised, but as for mistakes I shall admit to none until the day I see that creature turn honest and truthful, which in all likelihood is not just around the corner. In coming here I acted like Caesar, who was wont to say that 'twere better to expose oneself once in one's life to the dangers one fears than to live in a constant concern to try to avoid them. That reasoning led him to the Senate, where he knew full well the conspirators were awaiting him. I did the same, and like him I shall always be greater through my innocence and my frankness than my enemies through their baseness and the secret rancors that motivate them. You ask me how I am. But what's the use of my telling you? If I do, my letter will not reach you. Still, on an off chance, I am going to satisfy you, for I cannot imagine they will be so unfair as to prevent me from replying to something they have allowed you to ask me. I am in a tower locked up behind nineteen iron doors, my only source of light being two little windows each outfitted with a score of bars. For about ten or twelve minutes a day I have the company of a man who brings me food. The rest of the time I spend alone and in weeping ... There's my life ... That is how, in this country, they set a man straight: 'Tis by cutting off all his connections with society, to which on the contrary he needs to be brought closer so that he may be brought back to the path of goodness whence he had the misfortune to stray. Instead of good advice, wise counsel, I have my despair and my tears. Yes, my dear friend, such is my fate. How could anyone fail to cherish virtue when they offer it to you under such divine colors! As for the manner in which I am treated, 'tis in all fairness with civility in all things ... but so much fussing over trifles, so much childishness that, when I arrived here, I thought I had been transported to the Lilliputians' isle, where men being only eight inches tall, their behavior must be in keeping with their stature. At first, I found it funny, finding it difficult to get it into my head that people who otherwise appeared to be fairly sensible could adopt such foolish conduct. Later on I began to lose patience. Finally, I have taken to imagining that I am only twelve years old - 'tis more honest than if I were to pretend the others were that age - and this idea of having reverted to childhood somewhat tempers the regret a reasonable person would otherwise feel at seeing himself treated in this manner. But one completely amusing detail I almost forgot is their promptness to spy on you, down to your least facial expression, and to report it on the spot to whomever is in charge. At first I was fooled by this, and my frame of mind, always affected by and attuned to your letters, indiscreetly revealed itself one day when I was especially enjoying a note from you. How quickly your following letters made me realize how foolish I was! From then on I resolved to be as hypocritical as the others, and these days I control myself, so that not even the shrewdest of them can figure out my feelings from my face. Well then, my pet, there's one virtue I've nonetheless acquired! I dare you now to come here and tell me that one gains nothing in prison! As for the walks and the exercise you advised me to take, verily you speak as if I were in some country house where I might do as I please ... When they let the dog out of his kennel he trots off to spend one hour in a kind of cemetery about forty feet square, surrounded by walls more than fifty feet high, and this charming favor is not yet granted him as often as he would like. You can well imagine - or at least you ought to - how many disadvantages would result from leaving a man the same freedom one allows animals; his health might pick up all of a sudden, and then where the devil would their projects be, they whose only goal is to see him dead? During the sixty-five days I have been here, I have consequently breathed fresh air for five hours all told, on five different occasions. Compare that with the exercise you know I am used to taking, which is absolutely essential for me, and then judge for yourself what state I am in! The result is terrible headaches, which refuse to go away and totally exhaust me, dreadful nervous pains, vapors, and a complete inability to sleep, all of which cannot fail to lead to serious illness sooner or later. But what does that matter so long as the pr\u00e9sidente is pleased and so long as her dull-witted husband can say: \"That's all to the good, all to the good, 'twill make him mull things over.\" Farewell, my heart, be well and love me a little: that idea is the only one capable of easing my sufferings. </p> <p>As yet they have brought me nothing to sign. There was no need to announce this petition to me so far in advance with nothing concrete to show for it. And what is more, the draft you gave me leads me to believe that I am in for all kinds of lengthy delays. I am therefore going to ask permission to appoint someone my power-of-attorney. First this permission must be obtained, then the attorney must be appointed, informed, made to act ... Just imagine the delays that will ensue, and what an enormous amount of time it will take! Add to all that the meticulous way in which they hasten to have me sign the necessary papers and you will see that the whole thing adds up to an eternity. 'Tis true, however, I have the consolation of knowing that I shall not stay here one minute longer than the time necessary! </p> <p>Once again farewell, my dear good friend. Here's a long letter which may never reach you, since 'tis not written \u00e0 la Lilliputienne. No matter, it will not go unseen, and who knows whether, amongst all those who are obliged to see it, you are the one to whom I most directly address it? </p> <p>What you tell me of your children pleases me. You surely know how delighted I shall be to embrace them, although I have no illusions about the fact that - despite my affection - 'tis upon their account I am suffering at present. </p> <p>Rereading my letter, I can see all too plainly that they will never pass it on to you, which is proof positive of the injustice and the horror of everything I am being made to suffer, for if there were nothing but justice and simplicity in all I am experiencing, why would they fear your being told or finding it out? In any case, I shall not write to you again until I positively receive a reply to this one, for what is the purpose of writing to you if you do not receive my letters? </p> <p> <strong>5. To Madame de Sade </strong><br> <strong>REFLECTIONS AND NOTES UPON THE PETITION IN QUESTION</strong><br> <strong>April 21, 1777 </strong></p> <p>The beginning of the third page is very weak and very poorly done. At least you should have put after the words had stomach pains and vomiting: \"but does it follow that creatures who eat all sorts of unwholesome food every day of their lives are justified in ascribing the cause of their indisposition to these candied lozenges? However, influenced by the women to whom they related what had taken place between the petitioner and themselves, they did not fail,\" etc. </p> <p>On page 7, you state that women of this kind would not, or could not, be familiar with the etymology, the properties, and the effects of cantharides vesticatoria. That is wrong; such women are often well acquainted with this variety of drug, whose properties have the same virtue as their art, and there are very few among them, I firmly believe, who do not know what it is; and 'tis precisely because they do know what it is that they rushed to take it. It would have been better to say that it were strange indeed that they had not immediately noticed the difference between Spanish fly and poison, and, consequently, if indeed they knew full well the effect of the cantharides, that they pounced upon the poison; but that having found neither the one nor the other, they declared something they were familiar with instead of what they saw very well did not exist at all. Perhaps I may not have expressed my idea clearly enough, but they should have no trouble understanding what I mean. However, at least by adopting the one in the petition rather than claim that these women know neither its etymology, its property, nor its effects, I would at least have said that there was a good chance that women of this sort would not be so familiar with this drug as to be able to identify its taste, etc. </p> <p>At the bottom of the same page, a certain fact that is well known should have been added; namely, that all five of those women sat down together to a culinary feast with the money they had earned from the Marquis de Sade. The fact is known and established beyond any doubt. Hence 'tis most likely that the indisposition all five suffered derives therefrom. To prove that those five women were all sick at the same time and fail to mention this salient fact looks highly suspicious, and without certain knowledge of that fact I would be the first to find it most extraordinary that five women seen one after the other by one man, to all of whom he gave something to eat, could all five suffer from a case of indigestion. If in matters as basic as this they consulted the person most directly interested in vindicating himself, and assuming they did not look upon him as some kind of automaton, such essential anecdotes would not be forgotten and everything would certainly proceed more positively. </p> <p>By invoking that culinary feast at table, which has been well proven, you destroy your supposition at the beginning of page 8, which still seems dubious. By including it, how much force you add to the first seven lines of page 9: \"vomitings may,\" etc.! 'Twas a grave error not to include this point. </p> <p>On page 15, at the beginning, I do not like having your assumption that this girl could even have been \"sole witness,\" because she is not nor could she have been, as is constantly attested by the posture which, according to her own deposition, she maintained throughout the alleged consummation of the crime. In the position she claimed to be in, it is impossible that she could have seen what was going on. Therefore, she could not properly serve as a witness, and her opinion here can be founded only on the fact that at this moment the domestic went up to his master to whisper in his ear, recommending that he not have his way with this girl (believing him on the point of wishing to do so) because, said he, she is surely not in good health. That single incident could have led that creature to suppose what she has dared maintain as certain. </p> <p>Note at the bottom of the same page: I do not believe there is any girl who testified in the course of the proceedings that the crime of sodomy had been actively committed with her. So far as I know, I have not read that anywhere or heard it said. In any case, this allegation is perfectly false; no such proposition was ever even made to any of those creatures. </p> <p>The bottom of page 18 and the top of page 19 are very strong, faultlessly done. That in itself ought to destroy their entire thesis, I should think. But I do not like your terminating your petition with an admission of the defendant's misdeeds; for then, given this admission, the court must perforce find moral delinquency, and the least pronouncement of that sort is, as everybody knows, defamatory. It seems to me it would be preferable to let that be deduced or conjectured, without having the defendant sign this formal admission, which is visibly reprehensible and consequently held against him, and make him loath to sign the said petition. </p> <p>Furthermore, my dear friend, you must admit that 'tis rather remarkable that they are being so secretive about all this, to the point of not telling me to what high court this case is going to be sent for review. From this petition it looks as though it were to be the one in Paris, that quashing the decision becomes pointless, and that imprisonment, which sets aside contumacy, has served in its stead, and that the question remaining being one of procedure alone, as the petition says, a simple appeal would suffice. That is what comes through from this petition. It remains to be seen whether that is what it boils down to. I have no idea myself, and, thanks be to God, they leave me in complete ignorance, which is without any doubt the most ridiculous thing in the world, for considering where I am to whom could I breathe a word about it? Therefore being secretive is pointless, and it is used here simply to vex me all the more. This I find both exceedingly hard and exceedingly stupid, for I am vexed enough as it is; this further touch was useless. And who has a greater interest than I in all this? I beseech you therefore to keep me fully informed on everything, and without making me wait for three weeks, as you did after the other letter, which keeps me in a truly frightful state of anxiety and, of this you may be sure, succeeds only in embittering me and making my blood boil. </p> <p>In general, I do not find this petition written with the same force as the memorandum your mother presented to us a year ago. The difference between them strikes me as great, and I doubt whether they come from the same hand. In the memorandum there were much more powerful arguments for nullifying the second charge, which apparently are not raised here and yet of the two 'tis that one which, while equally false, would seem the easier to contend with; for in the first we have the girls vomiting: that, if you like, seems probable enough to justify, at least theoretically, the blindness, or rather the malicious obstination, of the so-called Marseilles judges. But what have we in the second? Nothing, absolutely nothing, not even the slightest probability. </p> <p>Nothing in this petition hints that the sentence was carried out.

As for the first note, 'tis a stylistic fault urgently in need of correcting, because it leaves a terrible weakness in that area.

That appears to me to explain your phrase that we shall have the wherewithal to confound our enemies in Provence. Let me know if that is what you meant. In general, the end of the petition is quite good, and I am most satisfied with it; the only fault I find in it is that it is somewhat less forceful than last year's memorandum, as I have just pointed out; and then the few observations duly noted in the first two pages of this letter. </p> <p>All this, as you see, my dear friend, is written helter-skelter and jotted as ideas occur to me after the two consecutive and careful readings of this petition I have just concluded. But you'll arrange all that, and understand, or So I trust, what I am trying to say despite my incoherent style. </p> <p>There is however, in the concluding part of this petition, one sentence, I must admit, that I am unable to grasp at all. Here it is, isolated to be sure, but read it in context and you will see that you may understand it no better than I: \"... and the veritable judges who, in judging, draw no distinction between contumacy and post-trial hearings, pass no other judgment upon the one than they would upon the other. But, through a contrary principle,\" etc. I do not understand a word of that sentence. If they can clarify it for me, I shall be most obliged. In general, what would have been the drawback in allowing me to chat here with my lawyer? None that I can see. </p> <p>In a word, having read and reread this petition, I come back to the point that if during the past five years everything has been prepared, as I had every reason to suppose, then this may well be over with quickly; but if nothing has been, as is also quite possible, it may yet drag on for a long time and keep me cooped up in here all that while. And another much more unpleasant possibility must be foreseen: if this admission of debauchery that I am going to be made to sign were, without regard for my imprisonment, to bring on yet another unfortunate ruling of a court, where would that leave me? New terrors and new anxieties in which they are pleased to leave me to stew, for I am quite right in saying that since I arrived here I have received neither the slightest legal advice nor the slightest comfort, and 'tis impossible to experience a more terrible plight. </p> <p>I most earnestly pray you, my dear friend, to obtain permission from M. Le Noir to write two notes a week to me instead of the one I am in the habit of receiving. 'Tis not in order to have news about my affairs more frequently: confine yourself to discussing those matters in the letter you customarily write each Monday, as I see from your dates; and I most earnestly beseech you, let the other contain nothing but a word about your health, without any detail regarding any other subject, which, I tell you, is dearer to me than anything else. Ponder what I am asking you here; and if you refuse, or if you fail to obtain it for me, you will hurt me terribly and cause me great anxiety. </p> <p>I have been meaning to tell you since learning that you are at the Carmelites' to steer clear of a certain room to your right as you enter the drawing room. Bear in mind that 'tis a worthless room, and that more than a decade ago my mother told me she did not dare enter it, because the architect had told her in no uncertain terms that the ceiling was on the verge of collapse.

Generally speaking, we departed in such haste and left everything in such disorder that it will cost us a pretty penny if we are not soon allowed to return, to put our affairs in order. </p> <p>Here is one more favor I might ask, which is hardly worth mentioning, because I am quite sure it will not be granted me: 'twould be to rescue me from the dreadful anxiety in which I find myself by telling me when I might be released.

If you can manage merely to give me some vague idea, 'twill be a mighty service you render me.

That is naught but calculated cruelty, and if there are not to be further delays, and if everything is both arranged and formalized, why not say so? What is to be gained from this overzealous severity? Moreover, between the two favors I ask here, remember, my dear friend, that the one relative to the second note I ask from you each week in order to inform me about your health is to me the more important, the more precious, and the one I most earnestly request, being full ready to sacrifice everything to the happiness of keeping forever such a friend as you, whose least indisposition would reduce me to utter despair. </p> <p>Farewell, my dear friend, I embrace you with all my heart. </p> <p> <strong>Supplement to the Notes Relative to the Petition.</strong> </p> <p>Why was it not indicated in this petition, during the discussion of the first charge, that Marguerite Coste's vomiting did not occur until after a man, known as an itinerant practitioner of medicine on the streets of Marseilles, had come (sent by lord knows who) and administered strange remedies to this girl for the simple stomachache about which she had complained to her hostess?

      "bodyText": "4. To Madame de Sade April 18, 1777 Tis most rightly said, my dear friend, that edifices constructed in a position such as mine are built only on sand, and that all the ideas one forms are naught but illusions, which crumble to dust as soon as they are conceived. Of the six combinations I figured out all by myself, and upon which I based a hope of some enlightenment in the near future, there remains, thanks be to God, not a single one, and your letter of April 14 caused them to disappear the way the sun's rays dissipate the morning dew. 'Tis true that on the other hand I did find in that same letter the comforting sentence telling me that I could be quite sure that I shall not stay here one minute longer than the time necessary. I know nothing on earth so reassuring as this expression, so that if 'tis necessary for me to remain here six months, six months I shall remain. That is charming, and verily, those in charge of guiding your style must perforce congratulate themselves upon the progress you are making in their profound art of sprinkling salt on the wounds of the wretched. Indeed, they have succeeded masterfully. I warn you, however, that 'twill not be long before my head explodes because of the cruel life I am leading. I can see it coming, and I hereby predict that they shall have every reason to repent for having used an excessive dose of severity with me, which is so ill-suited to my character. 'Tis for my own welfare, they maintain. Divine phrase, wherein one recognizes all too clearly the ordinary language of imbecility triumphant. 'Tis for a man's own good that you expose him to maddening conditions, for his own good that you wreck his health, for his own good that you feed him on the tears of despair! So far, I must confess, I've not had the pleasure of understanding or experiencing that kind of well-being ... You are wrong, the fools gravely declare to you: this gives you the chance to think things over. 'Tis true, it does make one think, but would you like to know the one thought this infamous brutality has engendered in me? The thought, deeply engraved in my soul, of fleeing as soon as I am able from a country where a citizen's services count as nothing when it comes to compensating for a momentary lapse, where imprudence is punished as if it were a crime, where a woman, because she is cunning and filled with deceit, finds the secret of enslaving innocence to her caprices, or rather to her commanding and personal interest to bury the veritable crux of the matter; and, far from those whose goal is to harass and annoy, and all their accomplices, of setting off in search of a free country where I can faithfully serve the prince who will provide me with asylum there, and thus may merit from him what I could not obtain in my native land ... justice and to be left in peace. Those, my dear friend, are my sole and unique thoughts, and I aspire to naught but the happy moment when I can put them into effect. We have been misled, you say. Not so ... I assure you that I was not fooled for one minute, and you ought to remember how, just before your room was filled with a pack of rascals - who, without producing any order from the king, had come, or so they claimed, to arrest me on the king's behalf - I told you that I did not trust your mother's reassuring letter and that since it was full of tenderness, one could be sure that her soul was feeding on a diet of deceit. No, my dear friend, no, I may have been surprised, but as for mistakes I shall admit to none until the day I see that creature turn honest and truthful, which in all likelihood is not just around the corner. In coming here I acted like Caesar, who was wont to say that 'twere better to expose oneself once in one's life to the dangers one fears than to live in a constant concern to try to avoid them. That reasoning led him to the Senate, where he knew full well the conspirators were awaiting him. I did the same, and like him I shall always be greater through my innocence and my frankness than my enemies through their baseness and the secret rancors that motivate them. You ask me how I am. But what's the use of my telling you? If I do, my letter will not reach you. Still, on an off chance, I am going to satisfy you, for I cannot imagine they will be so unfair as to prevent me from replying to something they have allowed you to ask me. I am in a tower locked up behind nineteen iron doors, my only source of light being two little windows each outfitted with a score of bars. For about ten or twelve minutes a day I have the company of a man who brings me food. The rest of the time I spend alone and in weeping ... There's my life ... That is how, in this country, they set a man straight: 'Tis by cutting off all his connections with society, to which on the contrary he needs to be brought closer so that he may be brought back to the path of goodness whence he had the misfortune to stray. Instead of good advice, wise counsel, I have my despair and my tears. Yes, my dear friend, such is my fate. How could anyone fail to cherish virtue when they offer it to you under such divine colors! As for the manner in which I am treated, 'tis in all fairness with civility in all things ... but so much fussing over trifles, so much childishness that, when I arrived here, I thought I had been transported to the Lilliputians' isle, where men being only eight inches tall, their behavior must be in keeping with their stature. At first, I found it funny, finding it difficult to get it into my head that people who otherwise appeared to be fairly sensible could adopt such foolish conduct. Later on I began to lose patience. Finally, I have taken to imagining that I am only twelve years old - 'tis more honest than if I were to pretend the others were that age - and this idea of having reverted to childhood somewhat tempers the regret a reasonable person would otherwise feel at seeing himself treated in this manner. But one completely amusing detail I almost forgot is their promptness to spy on you, down to your least facial expression, and to report it on the spot to whomever is in charge. At first I was fooled by this, and my frame of mind, always affected by and attuned to your letters, indiscreetly revealed itself one day when I was especially enjoying a note from you. How quickly your following letters made me realize how foolish I was! From then on I resolved to be as hypocritical as the others, and these days I control myself, so that not even the shrewdest of them can figure out my feelings from my face. Well then, my pet, there's one virtue I've nonetheless acquired! I dare you now to come here and tell me that one gains nothing in prison! As for the walks and the exercise you advised me to take, verily you speak as if I were in some country house where I might do as I please ... When they let the dog out of his kennel he trots off to spend one hour in a kind of cemetery about forty feet square, surrounded by walls more than fifty feet high, and this charming favor is not yet granted him as often as he would like. You can well imagine - or at least you ought to - how many disadvantages would result from leaving a man the same freedom one allows animals; his health might pick up all of a sudden, and then where the devil would their projects be, they whose only goal is to see him dead? During the sixty-five days I have been here, I have consequently breathed fresh air for five hours all told, on five different occasions. Compare that with the exercise you know I am used to taking, which is absolutely essential for me, and then judge for yourself what state I am in! The result is terrible headaches, which refuse to go away and totally exhaust me, dreadful nervous pains, vapors, and a complete inability to sleep, all of which cannot fail to lead to serious illness sooner or later. But what does that matter so long as the pr\u00e9sidente is pleased and so long as her dull-witted husband can say: \"That's all to the good, all to the good, 'twill make him mull things over.\" Farewell, my heart, be well and love me a little: that idea is the only one capable of easing my sufferings. As yet they have brought me nothing to sign. There was no need to announce this petition to me so far in advance with nothing concrete to show for it. And what is more, the draft you gave me leads me to believe that I am in for all kinds of lengthy delays. I am therefore going to ask permission to appoint someone my power-of-attorney. First this permission must be obtained, then the attorney must be appointed, informed, made to act ... Just imagine the delays that will ensue, and what an enormous amount of time it will take! Add to all that the meticulous way in which they hasten to have me sign the necessary papers and you will see that the whole thing adds up to an eternity. 'Tis true, however, I have the consolation of knowing that I shall not stay here one minute longer than the time necessary! Once again farewell, my dear good friend. Here's a long letter which may never reach you, since 'tis not written \u00e0 la Lilliputienne. No matter, it will not go unseen, and who knows whether, amongst all those who are obliged to see it, you are the one to whom I most directly address it? What you tell me of your children pleases me. You surely know how delighted I shall be to embrace them, although I have no illusions about the fact that - despite my affection - 'tis upon their account I am suffering at present. Rereading my letter, I can see all too plainly that they will never pass it on to you, which is proof positive of the injustice and the horror of everything I am being made to suffer, for if there were nothing but justice and simplicity in all I am experiencing, why would they fear your being told or finding it out? In any case, I shall not write to you again until I positively receive a reply to this one, for what is the purpose of writing to you if you do not receive my letters? 5. To Madame de Sade REFLECTIONS AND NOTES UPON THE PETITION IN QUESTION April 21, 1777 The beginning of the third page is very weak and very poorly done. At least you should have put after the words had stomach pains and vomiting: \"but does it follow that creatures who eat all sorts of unwholesome food every day of their lives are justified in ascribing the cause of their indisposition to these candied lozenges? However, influenced by the women to whom they related what had taken place between the petitioner and themselves, they did not fail,\" etc. On page 7, you state that women of this kind would not, or could not, be familiar with the etymology, the properties, and the effects of cantharides vesticatoria. That is wrong; such women are often well acquainted with this variety of drug, whose properties have the same virtue as their art, and there are very few among them, I firmly believe, who do not know what it is; and 'tis precisely because they do know what it is that they rushed to take it. It would have been better to say that it were strange indeed that they had not immediately noticed the difference between Spanish fly and poison, and, consequently, if indeed they knew full well the effect of the cantharides, that they pounced upon the poison; but that having found neither the one nor the other, they declared something they were familiar with instead of what they saw very well did not exist at all. Perhaps I may not have expressed my idea clearly enough, but they should have no trouble understanding what I mean. However, at least by adopting the one in the petition rather than claim that these women know neither its etymology, its property, nor its effects, I would at least have said that there was a good chance that women of this sort would not be so familiar with this drug as to be able to identify its taste, etc. At the bottom of the same page, a certain fact that is well known should have been added; namely, that all five of those women sat down together to a culinary feast with the money they had earned from the Marquis de Sade. The fact is known and established beyond any doubt. Hence 'tis most likely that the indisposition all five suffered derives therefrom. To prove that those five women were all sick at the same time and fail to mention this salient fact looks highly suspicious, and without certain knowledge of that fact I would be the first to find it most extraordinary that five women seen one after the other by one man, to all of whom he gave something to eat, could all five suffer from a case of indigestion. If in matters as basic as this they consulted the person most directly interested in vindicating himself, and assuming they did not look upon him as some kind of automaton, such essential anecdotes would not be forgotten and everything would certainly proceed more positively. By invoking that culinary feast at table, which has been well proven, you destroy your supposition at the beginning of page 8, which still seems dubious. By including it, how much force you add to the first seven lines of page 9: \"vomitings may,\" etc.! 'Twas a grave error not to include this point. On page 15, at the beginning, I do not like having your assumption that this girl could even have been \"sole witness,\" because she is not nor could she have been, as is constantly attested by the posture which, according to her own deposition, she maintained throughout the alleged consummation of the crime. In the position she claimed to be in, it is impossible that she could have seen what was going on. Therefore, she could not properly serve as a witness, and her opinion here can be founded only on the fact that at this moment the domestic went up to his master to whisper in his ear, recommending that he not have his way with this girl (believing him on the point of wishing to do so) because, said he, she is surely not in good health. That single incident could have led that creature to suppose what she has dared maintain as certain. Note at the bottom of the same page: I do not believe there is any girl who testified in the course of the proceedings that the crime of sodomy had been actively committed with her. So far as I know, I have not read that anywhere or heard it said. In any case, this allegation is perfectly false; no such proposition was ever even made to any of those creatures. The bottom of page 18 and the top of page 19 are very strong, faultlessly done. That in itself ought to destroy their entire thesis, I should think. But I do not like your terminating your petition with an admission of the defendant's misdeeds; for then, given this admission, the court must perforce find moral delinquency, and the least pronouncement of that sort is, as everybody knows, defamatory. It seems to me it would be preferable to let that be deduced or conjectured, without having the defendant sign this formal admission, which is visibly reprehensible and consequently held against him, and make him loath to sign the said petition. Furthermore, my dear friend, you must admit that 'tis rather remarkable that they are being so secretive about all this, to the point of not telling me to what high court this case is going to be sent for review. From this petition it looks as though it were to be the one in Paris, that quashing the decision becomes pointless, and that imprisonment, which sets aside contumacy, has served in its stead, and that the question remaining being one of procedure alone, as the petition says, a simple appeal would suffice. That is what comes through from this petition. It remains to be seen whether that is what it boils down to. I have no idea myself, and, thanks be to God, they leave me in complete ignorance, which is without any doubt the most ridiculous thing in the world, for considering where I am to whom could I breathe a word about it? Therefore being secretive is pointless, and it is used here simply to vex me all the more. This I find both exceedingly hard and exceedingly stupid, for I am vexed enough as it is; this further touch was useless. And who has a greater interest than I in all this? I beseech you therefore to keep me fully informed on everything, and without making me wait for three weeks, as you did after the other letter, which keeps me in a truly frightful state of anxiety and, of this you may be sure, succeeds only in embittering me and making my blood boil. In general, I do not find this petition written with the same force as the memorandum your mother presented to us a year ago. The difference between them strikes me as great, and I doubt whether they come from the same hand. In the memorandum there were much more powerful arguments for nullifying the second charge, which apparently are not raised here and yet of the two 'tis that one which, while equally false, would seem the easier to contend with; for in the first we have the girls vomiting: that, if you like, seems probable enough to justify, at least theoretically, the blindness, or rather the malicious obstination, of the so-called Marseilles judges. But what have we in the second? Nothing, absolutely nothing, not even the slightest probability. Nothing in this petition hints that the sentence was carried out. Is that yet another one of these things about which you say we have been misled? Please let me know what you think anent that. Be kind enough to communicate my notes to the lawyer. As for the first note, 'tis a stylistic fault urgently in need of correcting, because it leaves a terrible weakness in that area. As for the rest, I shall submit to his greater knowledge, and he will do as he sees fit; but at least he must make an issue of those creatures' culinary orgy at table: that, in my view, is essential to accounting for the stomach trouble all five of them suffered. The passage in the petition that says, page 10, \"But the court which shall weigh the complaints, the records of verification and of decomposition, the report upon the state of the two girls,\" and so on, suggests major delays, for 'tis clear they are going to start the whole procedure all over again, and in that case, all too clearly set forth by these phrases, I still have ahead of me more furious suffering from a misery that is already beyond my power to endure. For verily, my dear friend, I am truly at the end of my rope, and 'tis all I can do to ward off the impulses of my despair. What is most strange is that in all this there is never a word about my five months of prison in Savoy. It would seem that these were for the pure and simple satisfaction of your most gracious mother. How charming. What I do like about this petition is the clear field it seems to leave me to take to task all the poor beggars who have brought this ridiculous suit against me and for crushing, or so I hope, Martignan's divine brother-in-law. 'Tis a joy that will surely console me in great measure for all my sufferings, indeed if I am successful, and, verily, justice demands I be given that privilege, for they are great brutes, these people. That appears to me to explain your phrase that we shall have the wherewithal to confound our enemies in Provence. Let me know if that is what you meant. In general, the end of the petition is quite good, and I am most satisfied with it; the only fault I find in it is that it is somewhat less forceful than last year's memorandum, as I have just pointed out; and then the few observations duly noted in the first two pages of this letter. All this, as you see, my dear friend, is written helter-skelter and jotted as ideas occur to me after the two consecutive and careful readings of this petition I have just concluded. But you'll arrange all that, and understand, or So I trust, what I am trying to say despite my incoherent style. There is however, in the concluding part of this petition, one sentence, I must admit, that I am unable to grasp at all.

In general, what would have been the drawback in allowing me to chat here with my lawyer? None that I can see.

Why was it not indicated in this petition, during the discussion of the first charge, that Marguerite Coste's vomiting did not occur until after a man, known as an itinerant practitioner of medicine on the streets of Marseilles, had come (sent by lord knows who) and administered strange remedies to this girl for the simple stomachache about which she had complained to her hostess? This fact strikes me of sufficient importance not to be neglected. You must remember it crops up throughout both the proceedings and the memorandum.",

      "trailText": "<p>The Ch&#226;teau de Vincennes, a vast structure in the Val de Marne to the east of Paris, was built over a period of more than three decades, from 1337 to 1370. (It was, coincidentally, completed the year construction began on Sade's other prison nemesis, the Bastille.) It long served as a residence for the kings of France, and in the sixteenth century an imposing sainte-chapelle was added to the several imposing buildings within its walls.

Having come to Paris to bid farewell to my mother, who was breathing her last, with no other thought in mind than to see her and embrace her one last time, if indeed she were still alive, or to mourn her if she were not, 'twas that very moment you chose to make me your victim once again! Alas! I asked you in my first letter whether I would find in you a second mother or a tyrant, but you have not left me in doubt for more than a trice! Is it thus that you repay me for having wiped away your tears when you lost the father you cherished? And did you not find at that trying time my heart as sensitive to your grief as it was to my own? It is not as if I had come to Paris only to defy you, or with purposes in mind that might have made you wish to see me gone! ... But after the care and attention my mother's situation required, my second goal was only to calm and comfort you, then to come to an understanding with you, and as far as my affair is concerned, to take whatever measures would have suited you and that you would have suggested to me. Apart from my letters, Amblet, if he is candid (which I do not believe), must have told you as much. But the perfidious friend has been working in concert with you to deceive me, to undo me, and in this both of you have succeeded admirably. As I was being taken away [after my arrest] they told me it was only to expedite my case, and for that reason my detention was essential. But in all good faith, do you believe I can be duped by such talk? And when in Savoy you resorted to the same measures, what slightest effort on my behalf was undertaken? Since then did my two year-long absences produce the slightest initiatives? And is it not exceeding clear that what you seek is my total undoing, and not my rehabilitation? </p> <p> I am willing to go along with you for a moment that a lettre de cachet has been indispensable, in order to avoid a remonstration, which is always troublesome, but did it have to be so harsh, so cruel? Would a letter banishing me from the kingdom not have served the same purpose? And would I not have most scrupulously complied with that order, since I had just, of my own volition, put myself in your hands and submitted to whatever you might have demanded? When I wrote you from Bordeaux, asking that you send me the money wherewith to move to Spain, and you refused it to me, was that not a further proof you wanted me not far away but behind bars; and the more I ponder the circumstances the more I am completely convinced that you have never had any other thought in mind. But I am mistaken, Madame: Amblet revealed to me another one of your devices, and that is the one I intend to fulfill. He told me, Madame - at your behest no doubt - that a death certificate was the most essential and most appropriate document to bring this unfortunate affair to an end as quickly as possible. You must procure that piece of paper, Madame, and I swear I shall make sure you have it very soon. As I shall not multiply my letters, not only because of the difficulty I have in writing them but also because they seem to have not the slightest effect upon you, the present one shall contain my final sentiments, of that you may be sure. My situation is horrible. Never - and you know it - has either my blood or my brain been able to bear being cooped up. When I was under much less rigorous confinement - that you also know - I risked my life to rid myself of that yoke. Here such means are denied me, but I still have one that no one on earth can strip me of, and I shall take full advantage of it. From the depths of her grave my poor mother beckons to me: I seem to see her open her arms to me again and summon me to bury myself in her bosom, into the one haven I still have left. To follow her so closely is to me a satisfaction, and as a last favor I ask you, Madame, to have me laid to rest near her. Only one thing holds me back; 'tis a weakness, I admit, but I must confess it to you. I should have liked to see my children. For I so enjoyed going and holding them in my arms after having seen you. My most recent misfortunes have not stilled this desire, and I shall in all likelihood bear it with me to the grave. I commend them to your care, Madame. Even though you have hated their father, at least do love them. Give them an education which, if that is possible, will preserve them from the misfortunes my neglectful upbringing has vouchsafed to me. If they were aware of my sad fate, their souls, modeled after that of their tender mother's, would hasten to cause them to fall at your knees and their innocent hands, raised in supplication, would doubtless cause you to be swayed. 'Tis from my love for them this consoling image arises, but it can in no wise affect the course of events, and I make haste to destroy it for fear it may soften my heart at a time when what I most need is steadfastness. <br>Adieu, Madame. </p> <p> <strong>2. To Madame de Sade </strong><br><strong>March 6, 1777</strong></p> <p> Oh, my dear friend! When will my horrible situation cease? When in God's name will I be let out of the tomb where I have been buried alive? There is nothing to equal the horror of my fate! Nothing that can depict everything I am suffering, that can convey the state of anxiety wherewith I am tormented and the sorrows that devour me! Here, all I have as support are my tears and my shouts, but no one hears them ... Where is the time when my dear friend shared them? Today I no longer have anyone; it seems as if the whole of Nature were dead for me! Who knows whether you even receive my letters? No reply to the last one I wrote you proves to me that they are not being given to you and that 'tis to make sport of my sorrow or to see what is going on in my head that I am allowed to write them to you. Yet another refinement invented no doubt by the rage of her who stalks me as her personal prey! What can so much cruelty auger for the future? Judge for a moment in what state my poor mind must be. Till now, a faint hope sustained me, calmed the early moments of my terrible sorrow; but everything concerts to destroy it, and I clearly see from the silence wherein I am left, from the state I am in, that all they want is my undoing. If 'twere for my good, would they proceed in this manner? They must realize full well that the severe measures that are being taken with me can only unhinge my brain, and, consequently, from this naught can result (supposing they mean to keep me alive) save the greatest ill. For I am quite certain I cannot hold out a month here without going mad: which is probably what they want, and that fits in wonderfully with the means they proposed this past winter. Ah! my dear friend, I can see all too well my fate! Remember what I sometimes told you, that they had decided to let me finish out my five years in peace, and then ... There's the idea that torments me and is driving me to my grave. If 'tis in your power to reassure me on that score, please do so, I beseech you, for my state is frightful in the extreme and if you could only understand it fully for what it is, your heart would most assuredly be filled with pity for me. Nor do I doubt that they are making every effort to separate us: for me that would be the final blow, and I would not survive it, of that you may be sure. I beseech you to oppose this with all the strength at your command, and to understand that the first victims of this effort would be our children: there is no example of children made happy when their mother and father are in disagreement. My dear friend, you are all I have left on earth: father, mother, sister, wife, friend, you are all those to me, I have no one but you: do not abandon me, I beg you, let it not be from you that I receive the final blow of misfortune. </p> <p> Is it possible, if indeed they have my best interests in mind, that they do not sense they are ruining everything by meting out this punishment? Do they imagine the public will even try to understand? It will simply say: He certainly must have been guilty, since he has been punished. When a crime has been proven, you resort to these means either to calm a high judicial court or prevent it from passing sentence, but when 'tis certain no crime has been committed and that the sentence has been the height of madness and of meanness, one must not be punished, because you then undo all the good that could be accomplished if the verdict was annulled, and you clearly prove that influence alone has been operative, that crime has existed, and that one has besought the king to punish to avoid having the court do so. I contend that there could be nothing worse done against me than that, 'twould be to do me in for the rest of my life; and only a few years ago your mother was offered an excellent example of how little the military and the public were taken in by these maneuvers and continued to look askance at whoever took it upon himself to mete out punishment, whether it be at the king's hands or the court's. But that is how she is: whenever it's a question of acting on some matter, she leaps before she thinks, people mislead her, and they end up doing me far more harm than she has often intended. 'Tis the St. Vincent story all over again, tell her I would be greatly obliged if she would bear that in mind; here somebody else is playing the same role, and it's not difficult to figure out who. </p> <p> Finally, my dear friend, all I humbly ask of you is that you get me out of here as soon as possible, no matter what the cost, for I feel I cannot hold out much longer. They tell you I'm fine; it calms you to hear it, so much the better, nothing could make me happier. I am not going to disabuse you, because I'm forbidden to do so: that is all I can say to you. But please remember that I have never endured anything like what I am experiencing today, and that, considering the circumstances I was in, 'twas vile of your mother to have forced me into this present situation. The poor lawyer who said 'tis unnatural to heap sorrow upon sorrow, knew little about your mother when he made that declaration. I beseech you, while awaiting the blessed day when I shall be delivered from the horrible torments into which I am plunged, to arrange to come and see me, to write to me more often than you do, to obtain permission for me to take a little exercise after my meals, something which you know is more essential to me than life itself, and to send me without delay my second pair of sheets. For the past seven nights I haven't slept a wink, and during the night I throw up everything I've eaten during the day. Get me out of here, my good friend, get me out, I beg of you, for I feel I'm dying a little more each day. I don't know why they were so barbaric as to refuse me my camp bed: 'twas a very slight favor to grant, and which would at least have given me the satisfaction of forgetting my misfortunes for a few hours each night. But at least send me my sheets right away, I beg of you. Farewell, my dear friend, love me as much as I suffer, that is all I ask of you, and believe that I am at the height of my despair. </p> <p> <strong>3. To Madame de Montreuil</strong> <br> <strong> March 13, 1777</strong></p> <p>If in a soul capable of having betrayed in one fell stroke all the most sacred sentiments, those of humanity in having a son arrested beside the coffin of his mother, those of hospitality by betraying someone who had just given himself over to your care, those of Nature in not even respecting the refuge of your daughter's embrace; if, I say, in such a person some slight spark of compassion might still exist, I should perhaps try to awaken it by the most accurate and at the same time most frightful description of my horrible plight. But independently of the fact that these complaints are completely useless, I still have enough pride, however brought low it may be, not to embellish your triumph with my tears, and even in the bosom of misfortune I shall still find the courage to refrain from complaining to my tyrant. </p> <p> A few simple considerations will therefore be the sole point of this letter. You can value them as you like, and then I shall say no more ... Yes, I shall seal my lips, so that my opinions shall no longer be dinned into your ears, leaving you for a while at least the chance to revel in the knowledge of my unhappiness. </p> <p> I have long been your victim, Madame, but do not think to make me your dupe. It is sometimes interesting to be the one, always humiliating to be the other, and I credit myself with being blessed with as much insight as you can presume to have of deceit. For pity's sake, Madame, let us never confuse my case and my imprisonment: you will seek to bring my case to a conclusion for the sake of my children; and my imprisonment, which you claim indispensable to that end, and which it is most certainly not, is not, and cannot be, anything but the effect of your own vengeance. The most terrifying of all the legal opinions heard so far is that of M. Sim\u00e9on of Aix, who said in no uncertain terms that it was quite possible to obtain a judgment whereby exile would serve as prison to the accused. Those are Sim\u00e9on's very own words. Would not a lettre de cachet, in fact, which would have banished me from the kingdom, have served the same purpose? - of course it would - but it would not have served your fury nearly as well. </p> <p> Was it you, then, who concocted and had carried out the plan to have me locked up between four walls? And by what misadventure have the wise magistrates who today govern the State allowed themselves be hoodwinked to the point of believing they were serving the interests of a family when it was clearly a question of slaking a woman's thirst for revenge? Why am I once again behind bars? why is an imprudence being mistaken for a crime? why am I not being allowed to prove to my judges the difference between the two? and why are you the one who is keeping me from doing so? These are the questions to which Madame deigns not to reply, is that not true? Ten or a dozen bolts and locks serve as your answer instead, but this tyrannical argument, to which the laws are formally opposed, is not eternally triumphant. That is what consoles and comforts me. </p> <p> Focusing upon my case alone, is it to clear my name that you are having me punished? and are you suffering under the illusion that this punishment shall be ignored? Do you for a moment believe that they who, sooner or later, shall hear of it shall surely assume that there has to have been a crime somewhere, since there has been a punishment? Be it meted out by the king, be it meted out by judges, 'tis still a punishment, and will the public - which is neither indulgent nor overly curious to find out the truth of the matter - make this frivolous distinction? And will it not always see crime wherever punishment has been exacted? And what a triumph then for my enemies! What fertile soil you prepare for them in the future! and how tempted they will be to have a further go at me, since the results correspond so nicely to their intentions! All your scandalous acts over the past five years have nicely prepared people's minds and behavior in my regard, and you have been well aware of the cruel situation I have found myself in during this whole period, the constant target of fresh calumnies, which a sordid interest used to build upon the unhappiness of my situation. How do you think people can fail to judge a man guilty when the authorities have come knocking at his door three or four times, and when they then throw him in jail once they have their hands on him? Who do you hope to convince that I have not been in prison when they haven't seen me or even heard from me all this time? After all the means taken to capture me, you can well imagine that the only conclusion people can come to, since I have dropped out of sight, is that I have been arrested. What advantage will derive from this? My reputation lost forever, and new troubles at every turn. That is what I shall owe to the wonderful manner in which you are handling my affairs. </p> <p> But let us consider matters from another point of view. Is this a personal punishment I'm receiving? and is the thought this will turn me back onto the straight and narrow, as if I were a naughty little boy? A complete waste of time and effort, Madame. If the wretchedness and ignominy to which the Marseilles judges' absurd proceedings have reduced me, by punishing the most commonplace of indiscretions as though it were a crime, have failed to make me mend my ways, your iron bars and your iron doors and your locks will be no more successful. You ought to know my heart well enough by now to be convinced that the mere suspicion of dishonor is capable of withering it completely, and you are smart enough to understand that a misdeed, whose origin lies in hot-bloodedness, is not corrected by making that selfsame blood more bitter, by firing the brain through deprivation and inflaming the imagination through solitude. What I am calling to mind here will be supported by every reasonable being who knows me passing well and who is not infatuated with the idiotic notion that, to correct or punish a man you must shut him up like a wild beast; and I challenge anyone to conclude other than that, from such methods, the only possible result in my case is the most certain perturbation of my organs. </p> <p> If therefore neither my behavior nor my reputation stand to gain from this latest act of kindness on your part - if, on the contrary, there are nothing but negatives and, what is more, it disturbs my brain - what purpose will it have served, Madame, I ask you? Your vengeance, true? Ah, yes! I know all too well, 'tis always there one must return, and everything I have just written is quite beside the point. But what does all that mean, so long as I play the sacrificial lamb ... and you are satisfied? On the contrary, you must surely say to yourself, the greater the damage wrought, the more content I shall be. But should you not already have been sufficiently contented, Madame, by the six months of prison I served in Savoy for the same reason? Am I to believe that five years of afflictions and stigmas were not enough? and was this appalling denouement absolutely necessary, especially after the frightful demonstration I gave you of what lengths this sort of mistreatment could drive me to, by risking my life to escape from it! You must admit that, after that experience, 'tis an act of barbarity on your part to have the same thing inflicted upon me again, and with episodes a thousand times crueler than before and which, having the effect they do on my brain, will at the first possible opportunity have me dashing my head against the bars that presently confine me. Do not reduce me to despair, Madame; I cannot endure this horrible solitude, I feel it. Remember that you will never derive any good from making my soul more savage and my heart immune to feeling, the only possible results of the frightful state in which you have had me put. Give me time to make amends for my errors, and do not make yourself responsible for those into which perhaps I shall again be swept by the dreadful disorder I feel aborning in my mind. </p> <p>I am respectfully, Madame, your most humble and most obedient servant. <br>de Sade </p> <p>P.S. If the person from Montpellier returns there, I hope it will not be without the most urgent recommendation for her not to breathe a word about the scandalous scene to which you, with your usual wit, made her a witness, a blunder that, considering the circumstances of what her father has been up to, is assuredly quite inexcusable. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,407687,00.html\">Continue</a></p>",

I contend that there could be nothing worse done against me than that, 'twould be to do me in for the rest of my life; and only a few years ago your mother was offered an excellent example of how little the military and the public were taken in by these maneuvers and continued to look askance at whoever took it upon himself to mete out punishment, whether it be at the king's hands or the court's. But that is how she is: whenever it's a question of acting on some matter, she leaps before she thinks, people mislead her, and they end up doing me far more harm than she has often intended. 'Tis the St. Vincent story all over again, tell her I would be greatly obliged if she would bear that in mind; here somebody else is playing the same role, and it's not difficult to figure out who. Finally, my dear friend, all I humbly ask of you is that you get me out of here as soon as possible, no matter what the cost, for I feel I cannot hold out much longer. They tell you I'm fine; it calms you to hear it, so much the better, nothing could make me happier. I am not going to disabuse you, because I'm forbidden to do so: that is all I can say to you. But please remember that I have never endured anything like what I am experiencing today, and that, considering the circumstances I was in, 'twas vile of your mother to have forced me into this present situation. The poor lawyer who said 'tis unnatural to heap sorrow upon sorrow, knew little about your mother when he made that declaration. I beseech you, while awaiting the blessed day when I shall be delivered from the horrible torments into which I am plunged, to arrange to come and see me, to write to me more often than you do, to obtain permission for me to take a little exercise after my meals, something which you know is more essential to me than life itself, and to send me without delay my second pair of sheets. For the past seven nights I haven't slept a wink, and during the night I throw up everything I've eaten during the day. Get me out of here, my good friend, get me out, I beg of you, for I feel I'm dying a little more each day. I don't know why they were so barbaric as to refuse me my camp bed: 'twas a very slight favor to grant, and which would at least have given me the satisfaction of forgetting my misfortunes for a few hours each night. But at least send me my sheets right away, I beg of you. Farewell, my dear friend, love me as much as I suffer, that is all I ask of you, and believe that I am at the height of my despair. 3. To Madame de Montreuil March 13, 1777 If in a soul capable of having betrayed in one fell stroke all the most sacred sentiments, those of humanity in having a son arrested beside the coffin of his mother, those of hospitality by betraying someone who had just given himself over to your care, those of Nature in not even respecting the refuge of your daughter's embrace; if, I say, in such a person some slight spark of compassion might still exist, I should perhaps try to awaken it by the most accurate and at the same time most frightful description of my horrible plight. But independently of the fact that these complaints are completely useless, I still have enough pride, however brought low it may be, not to embellish your triumph with my tears, and even in the bosom of misfortune I shall still find the courage to refrain from complaining to my tyrant. A few simple considerations will therefore be the sole point of this letter. You can value them as you like, and then I shall say no more ... Yes, I shall seal my lips, so that my opinions shall no longer be dinned into your ears, leaving you for a while at least the chance to revel in the knowledge of my unhappiness. I have long been your victim, Madame, but do not think to make me your dupe. It is sometimes interesting to be the one, always humiliating to be the other, and I credit myself with being blessed with as much insight as you can presume to have of deceit. For pity's sake, Madame, let us never confuse my case and my imprisonment: you will seek to bring my case to a conclusion for the sake of my children; and my imprisonment, which you claim indispensable to that end, and which it is most certainly not, is not, and cannot be, anything but the effect of your own vengeance. The most terrifying of all the legal opinions heard so far is that of M. Sim\u00e9on of Aix, who said in no uncertain terms that it was quite possible to obtain a judgment whereby exile would serve as prison to the accused. Those are Sim\u00e9on's very own words. Would not a lettre de cachet, in fact, which would have banished me from the kingdom, have served the same purpose? - of course it would - but it would not have served your fury nearly as well. Was it you, then, who concocted and had carried out the plan to have me locked up between four walls? And by what misadventure have the wise magistrates who today govern the State allowed themselves be hoodwinked to the point of believing they were serving the interests of a family when it was clearly a question of slaking a woman's thirst for revenge? Why am I once again behind bars? why is an imprudence being mistaken for a crime? why am I not being allowed to prove to my judges the difference between the two? and why are you the one who is keeping me from doing so? These are the questions to which Madame deigns not to reply, is that not true? Ten or a dozen bolts and locks serve as your answer instead, but this tyrannical argument, to which the laws are formally opposed, is not eternally triumphant. That is what consoles and comforts me. Focusing upon my case alone, is it to clear my name that you are having me punished? and are you suffering under the illusion that this punishment shall be ignored? Do you for a moment believe that they who, sooner or later, shall hear of it shall surely assume that there has to have been a crime somewhere, since there has been a punishment? Be it meted out by the king, be it meted out by judges, 'tis still a punishment, and will the public - which is neither indulgent nor overly curious to find out the truth of the matter - make this frivolous distinction? And will it not always see crime wherever punishment has been exacted? And what a triumph then for my enemies! What fertile soil you prepare for them in the future! and how tempted they will be to have a further go at me, since the results correspond so nicely to their intentions! All your scandalous acts over the past five years have nicely prepared people's minds and behavior in my regard, and you have been well aware of the cruel situation I have found myself in during this whole period, the constant target of fresh calumnies, which a sordid interest used to build upon the unhappiness of my situation. How do you think people can fail to judge a man guilty when the authorities have come knocking at his door three or four times, and when they then throw him in jail once they have their hands on him? Who do you hope to convince that I have not been in prison when they haven't seen me or even heard from me all this time? After all the means taken to capture me, you can well imagine that the only conclusion people can come to, since I have dropped out of sight, is that I have been arrested. What advantage will derive from this? My reputation lost forever, and new troubles at every turn. That is what I shall owe to the wonderful manner in which you are handling my affairs. But let us consider matters from another point of view. Is this a personal punishment I'm receiving? and is the thought this will turn me back onto the straight and narrow, as if I were a naughty little boy? A complete waste of time and effort, Madame. If the wretchedness and ignominy to which the Marseilles judges' absurd proceedings have reduced me, by punishing the most commonplace of indiscretions as though it were a crime, have failed to make me mend my ways, your iron bars and your iron doors and your locks will be no more successful. You ought to know my heart well enough by now to be convinced that the mere suspicion of dishonor is capable of withering it completely, and you are smart enough to understand that a misdeed, whose origin lies in hot-bloodedness, is not corrected by making that selfsame blood more bitter, by firing the brain through deprivation and inflaming the imagination through solitude. What I am calling to mind here will be supported by every reasonable being who knows me passing well and who is not infatuated with the idiotic notion that, to correct or punish a man you must shut him up like a wild beast; and I challenge anyone to conclude other than that, from such methods, the only possible result in my case is the most certain perturbation of my organs. If therefore neither my behavior nor my reputation stand to gain from this latest act of kindness on your part - if, on the contrary, there are nothing but negatives and, what is more, it disturbs my brain - what purpose will it have served, Madame, I ask you? Your vengeance, true? Ah, yes! I know all too well, 'tis always there one must return, and everything I have just written is quite beside the point. But what does all that mean, so long as I play the sacrificial lamb ... and you are satisfied? On the contrary, you must surely say to yourself, the greater the damage wrought, the more content I shall be. But should you not already have been sufficiently contented, Madame, by the six months of prison I served in Savoy for the same reason? Am I to believe that five years of afflictions and stigmas were not enough? and was this appalling denouement absolutely necessary, especially after the frightful demonstration I gave you of what lengths this sort of mistreatment could drive me to, by risking my life to escape from it! You must admit that, after that experience, 'tis an act of barbarity on your part to have the same thing inflicted upon me again, and with episodes a thousand times crueler than before and which, having the effect they do on my brain, will at the first possible opportunity have me dashing my head against the bars that presently confine me. Do not reduce me to despair, Madame; I cannot endure this horrible solitude, I feel it. Remember that you will never derive any good from making my soul more savage and my heart immune to feeling, the only possible results of the frightful state in which you have had me put. Give me time to make amends for my errors, and do not make yourself responsible for those into which perhaps I shall again be swept by the dreadful disorder I feel aborning in my mind. I am respectfully, Madame, your most humble and most obedient servant. de Sade P.S. If the person from Montpellier returns there, I hope it will not be without the most urgent recommendation for her not to breathe a word about the scandalous scene to which you, with your usual wit, made her a witness, a blunder that, considering the circumstances of what her father has been up to, is assuredly quite inexcusable.

The Nigerian diplomat, speaking formally for the first time since the fatal stabbing 11 days ago, said that Damilola's death was a \"calamity\". \"Somebody somewhere knows something and is sheltering the perpetrators of this crime,\" he said, a day before what would have been his son's 11th birthday. \"Damilola was a boy with a promising future,\" he said. \"We all loved him very much. \"Since he came here with his mother because of the illness of his sister, he used his time learning about computers, made great friends and enjoyed playing football.\" On Saturday, Mr Taylor visited the site in Peckham, south east London, where his son was left to bleed to death on a stairwell on the way home from school. He staggered 100 yards with blood pouring from a sliced artery in his leg. Damilola's blood has since been found on two broken bottles that were discovered close to the body, but police cannot confirm that they were the murder weapons. Two new knives found following the attack were currently undergoing DNA and forensic tests. Mr Taylor said that his son had been improving himself even in the last hours of his life, spending time in a library rather than an amusement arcade. \"It will be a sad part of our lives that will remain with us forever.\" \"We all miss this lovely boy and I think my life can never be the same without Damilola.\" Police have appealed for three youths, two black boys and one white boy, seen just outside the stairwell where Damilola's body was found after the discovery, to come forward. Witnesses had seen the boys attempting to enter the stairwell. They are believed to be different from the group of boys aged between 11 and 14 who were seen in the area shortly before the attack. Mr Taylor said that he was confident that the \"traditional British justice system\" would result in the capture of his son's killers. \"The police have been working hard to apprehend the murderers of my son but I just want them to do it as fast as possible,\" Mr Taylor. He added that the last week had been \"harrowing\".

It was peaceful. \"But presently, the family value has been bastardised and allowed to go to the dogs.\" Damilola's parents will tomorrow hold a memorial service to mark what would have been his 11th birthday. More than 1,000 people are expected for the 1pm service at the Mountain of Fire and Miracle Ministry, the Nigerian pentecostal church in Old Kent Road, Peckham, where the Taylor family worship.

Some 20 independent exhibitions of more controversial work are being staged on the fringe of the biennale. One, called \"Fuck Oof\" [sic], was briefly closed down by the authorities. It included a sofa stuffed with decaying meat and a series of photos in which the artist appears to be eating a fried baby. Shanghai is a long way ahead of Beijing, where the ministry of culture continues to stress the necessity of \"resisting those [cultural influences] which are unsuitable to Chinese conditions\". But as art and antiquities become an ever bigger business, the balance is likely to tip further towards the market. More than 270,000 \"culture-related business organisations\" have already been set up, according to the culture ministry's statistics. The culture industry employs 1.2m people and its total annual turnover last year was estimated at 80bn yuan (\u00a36.7bn). The ministry says the potential market is more than seven times that size. It remains to be seen whether Starbucks survives in the Forbidden City: the contract for a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet in the former imperial Beihai park will not be renewed when it expires in 2002. But the cultural world seems set for more fast food and hard sales - with or without Chinese characteristics.",

But by any standards, Metro has been a success. With a current circulation of 778,000, the papers were making a profit within 11 months of launch, and crucially, without damaging sales at the Standard. After the success of the London launch, the Metro brand began to spawn young, taking the \"urban national\" strategy of free distribution to Newcastle, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and Edinburgh and now Leeds and Sheffield (in some cases printing and distributing using franchisees Trinity Mirror and now Regional Independent Media. The paper's formula is to give its audience the same national news as their London counterparts, but with regionally specific listings, lifestyle and arts and sports content. Last time Associated released figures, 369,000 copies were being distributed in London, 107,000 copies in Glasgow and Edinburgh, 61,000 in Newcastle, 83,000 in Birmingham and 147,000 in Manchester. The impact of the Metro launches was to spark not only circulation wars in Manchester and Newcastle, with bitter counter-offensives launched by Guardian Media Group in Manchester and Modern Times Group in Newcastle, but a spate of copyright wrangles over the use of the Metro brand.

      "byline": "Julian Glover",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>What is the Queen's speech?</b> <br> The Queen's speech is the central part of a wider ceremony known as the state opening of parliament, which marks the start of the parliamentary year. By tradition, the monarch sets out the legislation that he or she would like to see passed, in a short speech. Since the nineteenth century, this has effectively been a statement of the government's aims for the next year. Although the Queen reads it, she has no part in writing it. The speech is put together by a government committee known as futureleg - although in recent years, commentators have suspected that the government's spin doctors have a hand in it, too. <p><b>Why does the speech take place?</b><br> Because of an ancient parliamentary tradition which means that, each year, parliament begins work with an empty slate. Legislation under consideration cannot be carried over from one year to the next, even between general elections. As a result, the government has to set out its programme anew each year. The timing of the speech is long established - indeed, its origins appear to lie in the date of the medieval harvest. Beyond this, the speech provides a useful platform for the government to state its aims - and, as in this year,s case, its plans for the general election manifesto.</p> <p><b>Why is there so much ceremony involved?</b><br> Partly because the state opening of parliament is one of the few occasions on which the crown's traditional role in parliament is still on show. And partly because moves to simplify the ceremony have met with complaints. Some commentators even objected to the announcement by the lord chancellor, Derry Irvine, that he would no longer walk backwards from the royal presence after handing the Queen her speech to read. As a result, little has been changed.</p> <p><b>What happens after the speech has been delivered?</b><br> The work of parliament begins, with a string of debates on the policies proposed in the speech.

      "bodyText": "What is the Queen's speech? The Queen's speech is the central part of a wider ceremony known as the state opening of parliament, which marks the start of the parliamentary year. By tradition, the monarch sets out the legislation that he or she would like to see passed, in a short speech. Since the nineteenth century, this has effectively been a statement of the government's aims for the next year. Although the Queen reads it, she has no part in writing it. The speech is put together by a government committee known as futureleg - although in recent years, commentators have suspected that the government's spin doctors have a hand in it, too. Why does the speech take place? Because of an ancient parliamentary tradition which means that, each year, parliament begins work with an empty slate. Legislation under consideration cannot be carried over from one year to the next, even between general elections. As a result, the government has to set out its programme anew each year. The timing of the speech is long established - indeed, its origins appear to lie in the date of the medieval harvest. Beyond this, the speech provides a useful platform for the government to state its aims - and, as in this year,s case, its plans for the general election manifesto. Why is there so much ceremony involved? Partly because the state opening of parliament is one of the few occasions on which the crown's traditional role in parliament is still on show. And partly because moves to simplify the ceremony have met with complaints. Some commentators even objected to the announcement by the lord chancellor, Derry Irvine, that he would no longer walk backwards from the royal presence after handing the Queen her speech to read. As a result, little has been changed. What happens after the speech has been delivered? The work of parliament begins, with a string of debates on the policies proposed in the speech. Before these begin - usually the same afternoon - the Commons debates a short bill, which never reaches the statute book, as a symbol of the House's independence from royal command. Over the rest of the year, the government will introduce the legislation proposed in the speech and attempt to make it law. This year, though, the process is likely to be interrupted by a general election, meaning that few of the bills announced today will become law.

Many of this year's powerful entries were from mothers; others came from siblings. But the winning submission, Addiction Fictions, printed here, was from a wife, charting graphically the decline of her middle-class husband - and the ruin of their relationship . </p> <p>The competition was judged by a panel comprising Angela Harrison, author and mother of a drug user, Kim Worts, an Adfam trustee, Mike Trace, the government's deputy drugs tsar, and David Brindle, editor of Guardian Society. </p> <p>The winning entry will be read tomorrow evening at Adfam's fifth annual fundraising carol concert at St Bride's church in Fleet Street, London EC4. Celebrities Michael Parkinson, Nick Hornby and Josie Lawrence will be among readers at the event. Some tickets are still available at \u00a312. </p> <p> Adfam is on 020-7928 8898.

Their girlfriends' sex work pays for their drugs. My husband is a social worker. He earns more than me. We live in a nice house in a leafy city street. </p> <p>My husband uses some drugs. He says drugs are cool. He says they expand his mind and free his creativity. He says I should use more drugs. I've tried. It was quite interesting the first time. The second time was the same as the first time. I thought it was boring after that.

      "bodyText": "All too rarely is attention paid to the needs of the families and friends of drug users. But charity Adfam National works to help those caught up in their loved ones' addictions. \"Drugs can have a devastating effect on families, partners, children and friends,\" said Moira Campbell, the charity's fundraiser. \"The stress can lead to the breakdown of relationships and health, as well as to financial and legal problems.\" The charity has initiated an annual writing competition, encouraging people to express what it is like to live with a drug user. Many of this year's powerful entries were from mothers; others came from siblings. But the winning submission, Addiction Fictions, printed here, was from a wife, charting graphically the decline of her middle-class husband - and the ruin of their relationship . The competition was judged by a panel comprising Angela Harrison, author and mother of a drug user, Kim Worts, an Adfam trustee, Mike Trace, the government's deputy drugs tsar, and David Brindle, editor of Guardian Society. The winning entry will be read tomorrow evening at Adfam's fifth annual fundraising carol concert at St Bride's church in Fleet Street, London EC4. Celebrities Michael Parkinson, Nick Hornby and Josie Lawrence will be among readers at the event. Some tickets are still available at \u00a312. Adfam is on 020-7928 8898. Its helpline is 020-7928 8900. Addiction Fictions My husband's not a drug addict. Drug addicts are unemployed, use heroin and live in council flats. Their girlfriends' sex work pays for their drugs. My husband is a social worker. He earns more than me. We live in a nice house in a leafy city street. My husband uses some drugs. He says drugs are cool. He says they expand his mind and free his creativity. He says I should use more drugs. I've tried. It was quite interesting the first time. The second time was the same as the first time.

Peter Bart, editor of Variety said, \"The real test of this new effort will be what group of pictures they come up with - will they reach beyond the big Oscar contenders to honour some of the smaller but ultimately more important films that the Oscars might overlook?\" This might just be the means by which smaller American productions such as the acclaimed Requiem for a Dream (pictured) or Shadow of the Vampire might earn some recognition. The AFI 2000 will be announced on January 9, 2001.",

      "bodyText": "Wanadoo, France Telecom's internet service provider, has made a \u00a31.65bn takeover bid for British internet firm Freeserve. Shares in Freeserve were suspended from trading on the London stock exchange earlier today before the announcement of the bid for the British internet service provider. Last month, Freeserve, which is 80% owned by electrical retailer Dixons, said it was in talks that could lead to a takeover of the business. Wanadoo confirmed at the time that it was in discussions with Freeserve. New of the talks sent a shockwave through Energis investors who feared their company - part-owned by the National Grid - could lose important telecom contracts if Freeserve were bought. In June, Freeserve shares plunged by 20% after the collapse of merger talks with German rival T-Online that could have led to a \u00a36bn deal for the acquisition of the British company. At its last results announcement, in September, Freeserve said it had passed the 2m customer mark but losses for the first quarter of the year had doubled to \u00a317.8m. If Wanadoo succeeds in buying Freeserve, it would be its biggest acquisition since it floated in May. However, last month it was rumoured that Freeserve was in talks with other interested parties.

In a chapter for a new book about dangerous research, Dr Calvey describes an incident in which a bouncer was hurled into a canal in Manchester's gay village and another in which a club manager locked himself and his entire staff in a cellar when two men suspected of carrying guns began hammering on the front door.</p> <p> Commenting on the second incident, Dr Calvey writes: \"I prioritised my own survival over sociology but the tape was kept running throughout. Walking home with my vest on filled me with extreme anxiety about my personal safety and turned the brief journey home into a paranoid nightmare. \"Managing threats was a routine job of being a bouncer but at this point I felt very vulnerable...Taking a side was one thing; the threat of being removed from one was another.'' </p> <p> Dr Calvey's research was carried out in 1996 but he has delayed publishing for fear of recriminations. While on the job, he worried frequently about the ethics of his research and also lived in constant fear that his cover would be blown. \"Merely stating that I was an academic would offer no or very little protection,'' he adds. He still refuses to be photographed. One perk was that after his bouncing career was over, former colleagues on the doors offered him free entry to clubs and pubs. </p> <p> He claims that the bouncing business in Manchester still has links with gangsterism and drug crime despite strenuous efforts by Manchester city council and the police to clean up and regulate the business. \"It has long been the case that bouncers, affiliated to organised criminal fraternities, have colluded with drug dealers,'' he says.</p> <p> Dr Carey describes his first night at a new pub in the city's gay village, adding: \"The experience was an ethical baptism of fire in which I witnessed two assaults.'' A bouncer punched a customer in the face after refusing him entry. But the customer had a relationship with a gay bouncer who was a senior member of a Manchester gang running the doors in the area. \"He took revenge on our member of staff, assisted by eight other bouncers, by breaking his nose and throwing him in the canal...Everyone, including me, had seen and heard nothing. Traditionally, information has never been given by bouncers to the police. One bouncer described the cardinal rule as 'If the police are there, nobody has seen fuck-all'.'' </p> <p> The other incident took place at a club which had closed for two weeks to introduce new security measures in a bid to win back customer confidence after take-over bids by rival gangs. On the second night, a club staffed by ten bouncers in bullet-proof vests was visited by a Salford gang boss. \"When he arrived, one of the senior doormen hid behind the main door whilst nervously spying through through the peek hole and firmly pronouncing that he was not going outside,'' writes Dr Calvey. </p> <p> The head bouncer was summoned to the gangster's car while the other bouncers held an emergency meeting in the club as restless customers queued outside. But the night passed without incident until two men suspected of carrying guns demanded entrance. \"The head doorman was asked to go outside and investigate. He summed up the collective anxiety of the team by saying, 'I don't want to get no bullet over no bullshit'.\" The manager then locked all staff in the cellar and called the police.</p> <p> At the end of his six months on the doors, Dr Calvey retired to academia to continue his research. \"I partly enjoyed the seductive buzz from working on doors from the inside but I was simultaneously relieved eventually to melt back into the anonymous crowd.''</p>",

He summed up the collective anxiety of the team by saying, 'I don't want to get no bullet over no bullshit'.\" The manager then locked all staff in the cellar and called the police. At the end of his six months on the doors, Dr Calvey retired to academia to continue his research. \"I partly enjoyed the seductive buzz from working on doors from the inside but I was simultaneously relieved eventually to melt back into the anonymous crowd.''",

      "body": "<p>If it ain't broke, don't fix it. That's been the rallying cry of the defenders of our ancient, unwritten constitution through the ages - if not always in those words. Sure, say the old guard, our patchwork quilt of unspoken custom and tacit tradition may not make logical sense when set out on a clean sheet of paper - that's one good reason why we keep it unwritten. But, insist the keepers of the flame, our non-systematic system has held up just fine for centuries. So long as it still works, there's no need to change it.</p> <p>The trouble is, that's no longer true. The system is not working: it is broke - and we need to fix it. For the test of any constitution is the quality of governance it produces. In just the last few years we have seen all too clearly how well our system works: from the great pension scandal of the mid-1980s to the BSE calamity of the 1990s, from the outbreak of sleaze to the sell-off of our railways, from the poll tax to the debacle of the Dome - the proof is all around us of a standard of government that is just not good enough. In each case the system did not contain the checks and balances, the basic scrutiny, that might have weeded out bad legislation and prevented disastrous mistakes.</p> <p>This cannot be the exclusive fault of this administration or that individual politician. It happens too often for that. Rather, as both the Scott inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq affair or the Phillips report on BSE concluded, the flaw lies in the system itself - the way we are governed. And that means our constitution.</p> <p>The British people woke up to this fact long ago, even if few dare say it. Polling data consistently show a decline in esteem for our institutions and the system which links them together. While 48% expressed \"quite a lot of confidence\" in the House of Commons in 1985, that figure had halved by 1995. A year later a European Union poll found that Britons had less faith in their parliament than the people of any member country bar Portugal. Local government's standing has never been weaker, with turnout in council elections dropping like a stone. Trust in our institutions is in freefall, with the young especially disenchanted. One Mori survey found 71%of first-time voters convinced their ballot would \"make little or no difference to their lives\". We are beginning to vote with our feet - by staying away from the polling station. Britain's turnout figures are in decline, with recent by-elections lucky to involve more than 30% of the vote. In one Leeds seat, the turnout fell below one in five of all registered voters. It all adds up to a growing loss of faith in our system of governance.</p> <p>These trends are not wholly new: reformers have seen the need for a radical overhaul of our constitution for decades. But now there is an extra urgency. For not only is the old system not working well: it is beginning to come apart. Since 1997 Labour has undertaken a raft of constitutional changes so radical they have historians reaching for the 1830s to find a precedent. Whether it's the rolling programme of devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland or the partial reform of the House of Lords, the current government has shattered forever the traditionalist belief that our system is a frail, mystical thing that belongs in a glass case and can never be touched by human hand. The conservative conviction that the constitution has remained unaltered for centuries - and therefore cannot be changed in future - is gone. The patchwork quilt can be repaired and even renewed: after all, it's unravelling already.</p> <p><b> Four nations</b><br></p> <p>Specifically, Labour's changes have exposed to the light questions that had long been buried - and which now demand to be answered. Take devolution. Until 1997 Britain had never really come clean about its true nature as a multi-national entity: the four constituent nations each had their own cabinet department, but Britain was essentially a unitary state governed from Westminster and Whitehall. Devolution has blown that apart.</p> <p>It has forced us to recognise that there are distinct countries within Britain, each with the right and ambition to govern itself - whether through a parliament in Edinburgh or assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast. The days of crypto-federalism seem to be over: thanks to devolution, Britain has acted like a country ready to come out as a federal entity.</p> <p>But not completely. For Labour's decentralisation may have brought to the surface a clutch of dilemmas about Britain, but it has not resolved them. So, for example, most Britons now accept that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland deserve home rule - but what about England? Should Westminster serve as a federal legislature, dealing only with UK-wide problems - or should it double as a de facto English parliament? Why does one of the island nations, Scotland, have more autonomy than the others? Who should sit and vote in the Westminster parliament; in the terms of the famed West Lothian question, why should Scottish MPs vote on exclusively English matters when English MPs have no say on exclusively Scottish ones?</p> <p>What Labour has done is to open a can of worms: the worms were always there, we just couldn't see them before. Now the can is open we cannot look away. Perhaps the best illustration is the House of Lords. Some around Tony Blair might once have thought that expelling all but 92 of the hereditary peers would solve the problems of Britain's second chamber. Instead it's done the opposite, suddenly drawing attention to the absurd democratic deficit in parliament. When the hereditaries were there, the whole body could be written off as some Ruritanian joke. But Blair's reforms have prompted Britons to take a closer look. They now see a supposedly reformed second chamber barely more democratic than the blue-blood body it replaced - in which not a single member is elected. Leaving well alone, as the Tories used to advocate, was one thing. Now, say many Britons, if you're going to tinker with the upper house, you might as well make it democratic.</p> <p><b> Shattered mystique</b><br></p> <p>And that's a view which is beginning to apply to our entire constitution: now that Labour has broken the taboo by daring to change it, logic demands that it be changed properly - and democratically. For the current, spatchcocked arrangement of old custom and New Labour modernisation risks being the worst of both worlds, creating a constitution that makes no sense and lacks the old (if spurious) defence of ancient continuity. The mystique has shattered at last; now our very system of government is up for grabs. Even the Conservatives are discussing radical, constitutional change: witness William Hague's flirtation with the notion of an English parliament.</p> <p>There is one last factor which makes urgent our need for a new constitutional settlement. Britain may be an island, but we are not alone. The changes inside the United Kingdom have coincided with profound shifts outside it, too.</p> <p>We are days away from a summit in Nice which will debate and decide the future shape of the European Union. Who should govern? A simple majority of member nations or each state by wielding its individual veto? How should the peoples of Europe be bound together? With a common currency and a shared military force - or as a loose, free trade area? How should Europe declare its values? With communiques and treaties or with a basic law? In other words, the European Union is in the midst of constitutional upheaval, too.</p> <p>Beyond even Europe's boundaries, there is a similarly profound argument. The global anti-capitalist movement unleashed in Seattle and Prague asks who should rule the world - its people or the corporations and the World Trade Organisation? On the streets with the protesters or in the summit rooms of Nice, the debate turns on a single word: sovereignty. Put simply, who should be in charge? That's an issue for the world, as it grapples with the domination of Microsoft or Big Oil and gropes for a new regime of global governance. It's an issue for Europe, as it works out whether sovereignty can be pooled or only diluted. And it's an issue for Britain: who is sovereign in our land?</p> <p>What it all adds up to - the weaknesses of Britain's old system, the changes made by Labour and the worldwide confusion over sovereignty - is a need: we are crying out for a new constitutional settlement. We urgently require a new dispensation that would work better than the current set-up, improve the quality of our governance and yield better outcomes and better policies that would affect all Britons' lives. A new dispensation would also complete some unfinished business left over from Labour's programme of constitutional reform, turning today's \"unsettlement\" into a settlement. For those who care about the survival of Britain that has become an urgent task: for if we do not decide a future for the union of our nations, then that union will simply unravel. Britain will break apart.</p> <p>Our country needs this new settlement within our borders to work out our place in the world beyond them. Many reformers have argued that so long as we remain confused over our own sovereignty, we have little chance of sharing or pooling it with others. When the relationship between Scotland and England is still vexed, is it any wonder we cannot find the right connection between Britain and France?</p> <p>We need to make a change. We need to replace an unwritten constitution which consists of one abstract idea - the crown-in-parliament - with a settlement that fits the nation we have become and the world that now exists. We cannot wear the old, moth-eaten garb of the past any longer: we have outgrown it. This is a new century and a new millennium: we need a new constitution.</p> <p><b>Related stories - news</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407460,00.html\">6 December: Now is the time for change</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407462,00.html\">6 December: Majority want to be citizens not subjects</a></p> <p><b>Related stories - comment</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407452,00.html\">6 December leader: Magic or not, let in the daylight</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407471,00.html\">Jonathan Freedland: The people versus the crown</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407470,00.html\">Polly Toynbee: The need to modernise our country</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407341,00.html\">Christopher Hitchens: End of the line</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407484,00.html\">Vernon Bogdanor : The Guardian has got it wrong</a></p> <p><b>Related stories - background</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407239,00.html\">Full text: the act of settlement, 1701</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/graphic/0,5543,407538,00.html\">Cartoon: Steve Bell</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407374,00.html\">How ministers exercise arbitrary power</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407426,00.html\">Ten year deal fit for a Queen</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407468,00.html\">The Scottish threat</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7c0f2\">Do we need a monarchy?</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,407144,00.html\">What is the civil list - and how much is it worth?</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/quiz/questions/0,5961,407222,00.html\">Quiz: how well do you know your monarchy?</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.icmresearch.co.uk/reviews/pollreviews.htm\" target=\"_new\">Latest ICM polls</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Official British monarchy website</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.republic.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\" http: www.worldfreeinternet.net parliament settlement.htm?\">Full text of the Act of Settlement(from American parliament campaign)</a></p>",

In one sense, hardly at all; yet in another, it threatens to change everything, and in a relatively foreseeable future.</p> <p>Her Majesty of course inaugurated the parliament in 1998, and with a certain grace meant to endear her anew to northern subjects. These included the editor-in-chief of the Scotsman, Mr Andrew Neil, who was seen to go weak at the knees while commenting on the event for BBC Scotland. This once stalwart republican even forecast \"a new style of monarchy for the 21st century\".</p> <p>But the new style was soon in trouble. Because of the large Catholic vote in Scotland, all Scottish parties have a common interest in combating sectarianism, and the new assembly unanimously decided the Windsors were delinquents in this regard. The campaign was backed by Michael Forsyth, a former Tory secretary of state. The modern crown rests upon the infamous 1701 Act of Settlement, which declared that no individual of the Catholic faith should ever again occupy a British throne. Could any sane multicultural court of the present do anything but condemn such discrimination? Surely it was time for Holyrood and Westminster to join in repealing the anachronism?</p> <p>With unexampled haste and glibness, Blair declined this honour. No parliamentary time, far too many consultations needed, not within the Scottish remit, and emphatically not the kind of thing middle England wanted to hear about. He had not reprieved the Windsors from Diana-fever, merely to subvert them from another direction. Also, an untarnished Queen would be required to open the Millenium Dome.</p> <p>This fire-hose of platitudes omitted something quite important. The Act of Settlement is one item in the rather meagre written part of the British constitution, alongside the less picturesque Treaty of Union of 1706-7. In fact, it was a necessary condition of the latter. In fact, it was just too damn close to the spinal column of \"all we hold dear\". There are, after all, extremists around (not all Scots) who believe that a modern written constitution would be better for the United Kingdom (or the United Whatever-it-is), and ought to replace these heirlooms altogether. Some of them even think it was a precondition of devolved government, and that without it devolution is sure to break down.</p> <p>Such lunatics are at odds (sometimes unknowingly) with the very soul of the United Kingdom. The third way pines for regeneration, not wholesale replacement. It wants a monarch kind to Muslims and Buddhists, not a soulless republic. Having transformed local government into \"local government\" through devolution, it now has little time for upstarts with ideas exceeding their non-sovereign status. The crown should support a given dispensation of authority, not become a lever of possible alteration.</p> <p>The Scottish parliament's appeal on the 1701 act was intended reasonably, as a gesture of atonement. In reality, it was an arrow aimed at the very core of Anglo-British custom-observance. Formal renunciation of this part of the symbol-heritage might encourage a more thorough formalism, and a lettered constitutionalism, the antithesis of royal magic. Republicanism thrives on precisely that tendency. Also, the Act of Settlement was a prelude to the Treaty of Union between the old parliaments of Scotland and England, five years later: the very hinge of the United Kingdom, and just as much of an anachronism.</p> <p>It was recently reiterated in the Scotland Act 1998, an element of the New Labour dispensation, therefore, and meant to stabilise it. Decidedly, children should not be allowed to play with matches in this cellar.</p> <p>But play they will. By 2007, the third centenary of union, the SNP will quite probably control the executive, and be seeking to repeal the old treaty. And there will be a growing number of English republicans who agree with them. Since no new constitutional settlement was allowed to precede devolution, it will have to follow it. The matter of Britain, in which most Scots have an overwhelmingly strong, and often personal, interest, could then be renegotiated on a basis of equality, along with the other countries and populations awarded places on the Belfast Agreement's \"Council of the Isles\".</p> <p>Terrifying only to addicts of the great and the exceptional, such a process would seek to keep (and build upon) what matters to the common life of the archipelago. Republican in essence, it would surely dispel such 18th century phantasms once and for all.</p> <p>Tom Nairn is research fellow in Irish and Scottish studies at the Unversity of Aberdeen.

Because of the large Catholic vote in Scotland, all Scottish parties have a common interest in combating sectarianism, and the new assembly unanimously decided the Windsors were delinquents in this regard. The campaign was backed by Michael Forsyth, a former Tory secretary of state. The modern crown rests upon the infamous 1701 Act of Settlement, which declared that no individual of the Catholic faith should ever again occupy a British throne. Could any sane multicultural court of the present do anything but condemn such discrimination? Surely it was time for Holyrood and Westminster to join in repealing the anachronism? With unexampled haste and glibness, Blair declined this honour. No parliamentary time, far too many consultations needed, not within the Scottish remit, and emphatically not the kind of thing middle England wanted to hear about. He had not reprieved the Windsors from Diana-fever, merely to subvert them from another direction. Also, an untarnished Queen would be required to open the Millenium Dome. This fire-hose of platitudes omitted something quite important. The Act of Settlement is one item in the rather meagre written part of the British constitution, alongside the less picturesque Treaty of Union of 1706-7. In fact, it was a necessary condition of the latter. In fact, it was just too damn close to the spinal column of \"all we hold dear\". There are, after all, extremists around (not all Scots) who believe that a modern written constitution would be better for the United Kingdom (or the United Whatever-it-is), and ought to replace these heirlooms altogether. Some of them even think it was a precondition of devolved government, and that without it devolution is sure to break down. Such lunatics are at odds (sometimes unknowingly) with the very soul of the United Kingdom. The third way pines for regeneration, not wholesale replacement. It wants a monarch kind to Muslims and Buddhists, not a soulless republic. Having transformed local government into \"local government\" through devolution, it now has little time for upstarts with ideas exceeding their non-sovereign status. The crown should support a given dispensation of authority, not become a lever of possible alteration. The Scottish parliament's appeal on the 1701 act was intended reasonably, as a gesture of atonement. In reality, it was an arrow aimed at the very core of Anglo-British custom-observance. Formal renunciation of this part of the symbol-heritage might encourage a more thorough formalism, and a lettered constitutionalism, the antithesis of royal magic. Republicanism thrives on precisely that tendency. Also, the Act of Settlement was a prelude to the Treaty of Union between the old parliaments of Scotland and England, five years later: the very hinge of the United Kingdom, and just as much of an anachronism. It was recently reiterated in the Scotland Act 1998, an element of the New Labour dispensation, therefore, and meant to stabilise it. Decidedly, children should not be allowed to play with matches in this cellar. But play they will. By 2007, the third centenary of union, the SNP will quite probably control the executive, and be seeking to repeal the old treaty. And there will be a growing number of English republicans who agree with them. Since no new constitutional settlement was allowed to precede devolution, it will have to follow it. The matter of Britain, in which most Scots have an overwhelmingly strong, and often personal, interest, could then be renegotiated on a basis of equality, along with the other countries and populations awarded places on the Belfast Agreement's \"Council of the Isles\". Terrifying only to addicts of the great and the exceptional, such a process would seek to keep (and build upon) what matters to the common life of the archipelago. Republican in essence, it would surely dispel such 18th century phantasms once and for all. Tom Nairn is research fellow in Irish and Scottish studies at the Unversity of Aberdeen.

In separating the role of head of state from that of head of government, a constitutional monarchy ensures that the head of state is free from party ties. This, surely, is of inestimable value in an age when politics has come to invade almost every aspect of our national life, choking all too many activities in its unnatural embrace.</p> <p>It is because of her political neutrality that the Queen can act not only as head of state but also as head of the nation, or, perhaps more accurately, as head of the various nations which comprise the United Kingdom. At times of national commemoration such as the anniversary of D Day or VE Day, the Queen speaks for all, whatever their political allegiance. She alone is in a position to interpret the country to itself. A president could not easily do so because of the political baggage which he or she would carry. Republicans have, admittedly, been searching, rather desperately, for a modern analogue to the late Lord Franks, a member of the great and the good without any party history, whom they can propose for the British presidency. The trouble is, however, that Margaret Thatcher demanded that the great and the good stand up to be counted. They were either for her or against. Since then, the great and the good seem mysteriously to have disappeared.</p> <p>But in any case no figure, however eminent, could aspire to the presidency without acquiring the support of a political party. Indeed, with a directly elected president, as in France, the parties would put all their energies into getting their own candidate into Buckingham Palace. This conception of the presidency, however, as political leader as well as head of state, would radically alter our political system. Politicians here would be no more likely to agree to it than they were in Australia where last year's republican referendum offered the alternative of a president chosen not, as in France, by the people but, as in Germany and Italy, by parliament.</p> <p>A president chosen by parliament would most likely be a retired politician, a party warhorse who could be relied upon not to cause trouble. Names such as Neil Kinnock and Tony Newton spring to mind, although the Conservatives might just conceivably be prepared to risk Margaret Thatcher, hoping perhaps that high symbolic office would put a stop to her wilder utterances. One cannot help feeling, however, that the appearance of Mr Kinnock, Mr Newton or even Lady Thatcher on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for the anniversary of VE Day, would not have had quite the emotional resonance of an appearance by the Queen.</p> <p>There is, in much of the western world, a distinctly anti-political mood, as voters come to feel that they can make better decisions for themselves than politicians acting on their behalf. It was indeed partly for this reason that the Australian referendum resulted in a defeat for the republicans. In the United States the legitimacy of government has been severely damaged by the confusions in Florida that remind us of the dangers of a political system in which every office has a party taint, even the courtrooms being stuffed with political appointees. If the answer is more politicians, we are, as John Major once said, asking the wrong question.</p> <p>The unifying role of the monarchy has become even more important with devolution which has made Britain an explicitly multinational state. In Belgium, it is sometimes said that the king is the only Belgian, everyone else being either Fleming or Walloon. Similarly, in Britain a president would be either English, Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish - most probably English, since the English comprise 85% of the population. The Queen alone can belong, not to any single one of the nationalities comprising the United Kingdom, but to all of them.</p> <p>There is a further feature of our monarchy which is often ignored: its international aspect. The Queen is the symbolic head of a multiracial Commonwealth of 54 countries representing around one-third of the world's population. Most of these countries are former British colonies who have chosen, entirely voluntarily, to continue their association with Britain. While lacking formal powers, the Commonwealth is not without influence, enabling Britain, in Douglas Hurd's words, to \"punch above her weight\" in diplomatic affairs, through her connections with Africa, the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean. An elected head of the Commonwealth, however, would probably seek a more positive leadership role which the Commonwealth would be unable to sustain, while a rotating head, as once proposed by Tony Benn, might have allowed Idi Amin of Uganda to traverse the world as head of the Commonwealth. Thus the device by which the Queen is a symbolic head enables it to avoid what could prove an embarrassing constitutional problem.</p> <p>It is because the arguments for constitutional monarchy are so powerful that republicanism has not been a serious political force in Britain since the 1870s, when Joseph Chamberlain confidently told his Radical colleague, Sir Charles Dilke, that: \"The republic must come, and at the rate at which we are moving, it will come in our generation.\"</p> <p>The 1870s, however, proved to be the high water mark of republicanism, and, in the 20th century, the left has disdained it. The Labour party conference last debated the monarchy in 1923 when republicanism was defeated by 3,694,000 votes to 386,000. In the aftermath of the abdication, in December 1936, a republican motion in the Commons could muster only five votes in its support.</p> <p>Today, however, republicans have come up with a new argument. They claim that monarchy, whose roots lie in the past, symbolises deference and hierarchy, thereby underpinning values which hinder the modernisation of Britain. It is the idea of the crown, insists Stephen Haseler, chairman of Republic, which \"stops us from seriously modernising our polity\".</p> <p>It is hard to take this argument seriously. Denmark, Norway and Sweden, after all, are monarchies, yet more markedly egalitarian than such republics as France and Germany. Italy is hardly more modern than Norway, nor is Portugal noticeably more efficient than the Netherlands. Moreover, the experience of Japan shows that a monarchy of a highly traditional kind is perfectly compatible with economic success. The truth is that, in Britain, the monarchy has become the latest and the least convincing of the many scapegoats which the left has produced to account for its failure to win the people to its cause.</p> <p>There is indeed no correlation between republicanism and modernisation. Constitutional monarchy yields not conservatism but legitimacy since it settles beyond argument the question of who is to be head of state, putting that position beyond the reach of politicians. Wise leaders of the left, from Gladstone to Blair, have always understood that because change is bound to be disorientating, a reforming government needs the monarchy even more than a government committed to the status quo. It is for this reason that the hopes of modern republicans are likely to be dashed as cruelly as were those of Joseph Chamberlain 130 years ago.</p> <p>Vernon Bogdanor is professor of government at Oxford University.

      "body": "<p>The Queen has made an extraordinary profit of \u00a335.3m out of taxpayers' cash given to finance her lifestyle over the last decade. The figure was revealed this year when Tony Blair and Gordon Brown released the financial accounts of the civil list - the \u00a37.9m a year voted by parliament to the royal family to cover their public duties.</p> <p>The huge surplus came to light after it was revealed in parliament this year that a deal was struck a decade ago with former prime ministers Lady Thatcher and John Major. This allowed that the Queen should receive a fixed sum for her official duties and those undertaken by the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh. The figure had a built in allowance for 7.5% inflation - which never materialised. Over the decade it averaged 3.2 %.</p> <p>The reason why the figure was hidden for so long is because spending on the monarchy is kept secret under a deal signed more than two centuries ago. The civil list dates from an agreement between George III and parliament in 1760. The monarch agreed to hand over the revenue from the crown estate - which owns everything from large landholdings in Somerset to the freeholds of shops in London's Regent Street - in return for an allowance voted by parliament. Parliament's exchequer and audit department was kept away from examining the accounts.</p> <p>The deal was rewritten in 1952 under Winston Churchill's government. In 1952 a new Civil List Act agreed to an annual review to cover the Queen's royal expenses - regular allowances for all the royals - and it authorised other government departments to fund royal activities. At present six ministries, two executive agencies and one nationalised industry (the Royal Mail) all fund royal activities, on top of the money from the civil list- taking this year's expenditure to over \u00a337m. In 1972, after a period of raging inflation, Edward Heath's government passed a new Civil List Act which gave the Queen a guaranteed regular income for a decade. It was decided that the Queen should not ask parliament to vote her cash every year because \"an annual review would not be commensurate with the honour and dignity of the monarchy\".</p> <p>The result is that civil list is now the least scrutinised account in the whole country. The figures on the money the Queen spends can only be examined every 10 years. MPs are barred from asking questions about spending on the civil list - they are automatically stopped by the House of Commons table office from even putting them down. Parliament's financial watch-dog, Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, is still not allowed to audit the civil list. He has recently been allowed to scrutinise the accounts of the royal household but the civil list remains \"out of bounds\". They are the sole responsibility of Michael Peat, the keeper of the privy purse. They can only be seen and checked in private once a year by the permanent secretary at the treasury, Sir Andrew Turnbull. The civil list is forecast to spend \u00a34,701,971 this year on the salaries of courtiers and staff to serve the Queen. It shows the Queen plans to spend \u00a3423,326 on garden parties; \u00a366,749 on wine and spirits for receptions; \u00a3118,000 on royal carriages; \u00a3142,000 on stationary and \u00a3230,872 on private travel. She will also spend \u00a372,000 on lawyers and other professional services. No such detailed figures on the royal accounts will now be issued until 2010.</p> <p>In addition the Queen receives over \u00a31m a year for annual salaries for the Queen Mother, who receives \u00a3643,000, and the Duke of Edinburgh, who receives \u00a3359,000. All the other allowances from the Duke of York to Princess Margaret are now funded from her private sources. Prince Charles receives a private income from the Duchy of Cornwall.</p> <p>The civil list only tells part of the story. By the far the larger sum, amounting to nearly \u00a330m this year, comes from money voted from other ministries for the upkeep of the occupied royal palaces - Buckingham Palace, St James' Palace, Kensington Palace, Holyroodhouse, Clarence House and Windsor Castle. The cash also covers royal travel, administering the honours system, stands and flags for state visits, computer support and over \u00a31.2m on posting letters. The more these accounts - which can be examined by Sir John Bourn and the Commons public accounts committee - are scrutinised the larger the fall in these bills. The total bill for funding royals has dropped from \u00a365.5m in 1991 to a forecast \u00a337.2m this year.</p> <p>Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West and the most senior Labour member on the Commons public accounts committee, believes this is not a coincidence. He is probably the most assiduous watcher of royal spending in the present Commons. Over the last six years he has queried how much use has been made of the royal yacht, the royal train and the Queen's flight - disclosing that these remained idle for most of the year. He also uncovered how many of the royal courtiers were living in subsidised expensive flats in the royal palaces - at rents lower than those charged by Westminster City Council for its tenants.</p> <p>Since his questioning began the palace has made enormous strides in saving cash. The royal yacht, which was costing the taxpayer up to \u00a312m a year to maintain, has gone. The royal train has been privatised and its cost has dropped from \u00a32.6m a year to a leasing deal costing \u00a3237,000 a year. The Queen's flight bill is down from over \u00a316m a year to around \u00a311m. The courtiers, from royal librarian, to the private secretaries to Princess Margaret and the Princess royal, have lost their cheap flats.

      "bodyText": "The Queen has made an extraordinary profit of \u00a335.3m out of taxpayers' cash given to finance her lifestyle over the last decade. The figure was revealed this year when Tony Blair and Gordon Brown released the financial accounts of the civil list - the \u00a37.9m a year voted by parliament to the royal family to cover their public duties. The huge surplus came to light after it was revealed in parliament this year that a deal was struck a decade ago with former prime ministers Lady Thatcher and John Major. This allowed that the Queen should receive a fixed sum for her official duties and those undertaken by the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh. The figure had a built in allowance for 7.5% inflation - which never materialised. Over the decade it averaged 3.2 %. The reason why the figure was hidden for so long is because spending on the monarchy is kept secret under a deal signed more than two centuries ago. The civil list dates from an agreement between George III and parliament in 1760. The monarch agreed to hand over the revenue from the crown estate - which owns everything from large landholdings in Somerset to the freeholds of shops in London's Regent Street - in return for an allowance voted by parliament. Parliament's exchequer and audit department was kept away from examining the accounts. The deal was rewritten in 1952 under Winston Churchill's government. In 1952 a new Civil List Act agreed to an annual review to cover the Queen's royal expenses - regular allowances for all the royals - and it authorised other government departments to fund royal activities. At present six ministries, two executive agencies and one nationalised industry (the Royal Mail) all fund royal activities, on top of the money from the civil list- taking this year's expenditure to over \u00a337m. In 1972, after a period of raging inflation, Edward Heath's government passed a new Civil List Act which gave the Queen a guaranteed regular income for a decade. It was decided that the Queen should not ask parliament to vote her cash every year because \"an annual review would not be commensurate with the honour and dignity of the monarchy\". The result is that civil list is now the least scrutinised account in the whole country. The figures on the money the Queen spends can only be examined every 10 years. MPs are barred from asking questions about spending on the civil list - they are automatically stopped by the House of Commons table office from even putting them down. Parliament's financial watch-dog, Sir John Bourn, the comptroller and auditor general, is still not allowed to audit the civil list. He has recently been allowed to scrutinise the accounts of the royal household but the civil list remains \"out of bounds\". They are the sole responsibility of Michael Peat, the keeper of the privy purse. They can only be seen and checked in private once a year by the permanent secretary at the treasury, Sir Andrew Turnbull. The civil list is forecast to spend \u00a34,701,971 this year on the salaries of courtiers and staff to serve the Queen. It shows the Queen plans to spend \u00a3423,326 on garden parties; \u00a366,749 on wine and spirits for receptions; \u00a3118,000 on royal carriages; \u00a3142,000 on stationary and \u00a3230,872 on private travel. She will also spend \u00a372,000 on lawyers and other professional services. No such detailed figures on the royal accounts will now be issued until 2010. In addition the Queen receives over \u00a31m a year for annual salaries for the Queen Mother, who receives \u00a3643,000, and the Duke of Edinburgh, who receives \u00a3359,000. All the other allowances from the Duke of York to Princess Margaret are now funded from her private sources. Prince Charles receives a private income from the Duchy of Cornwall. The civil list only tells part of the story. By the far the larger sum, amounting to nearly \u00a330m this year, comes from money voted from other ministries for the upkeep of the occupied royal palaces - Buckingham Palace, St James' Palace, Kensington Palace, Holyroodhouse, Clarence House and Windsor Castle. The cash also covers royal travel, administering the honours system, stands and flags for state visits, computer support and over \u00a31.2m on posting letters. The more these accounts - which can be examined by Sir John Bourn and the Commons public accounts committee - are scrutinised the larger the fall in these bills. The total bill for funding royals has dropped from \u00a365.5m in 1991 to a forecast \u00a337.2m this year. Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea West and the most senior Labour member on the Commons public accounts committee, believes this is not a coincidence. He is probably the most assiduous watcher of royal spending in the present Commons. Over the last six years he has queried how much use has been made of the royal yacht, the royal train and the Queen's flight - disclosing that these remained idle for most of the year. He also uncovered how many of the royal courtiers were living in subsidised expensive flats in the royal palaces - at rents lower than those charged by Westminster City Council for its tenants. Since his questioning began the palace has made enormous strides in saving cash. The royal yacht, which was costing the taxpayer up to \u00a312m a year to maintain, has gone. The royal train has been privatised and its cost has dropped from \u00a32.6m a year to a leasing deal costing \u00a3237,000 a year. The Queen's flight bill is down from over \u00a316m a year to around \u00a311m. The courtiers, from royal librarian, to the private secretaries to Princess Margaret and the Princess royal, have lost their cheap flats. Other royal staff such as Michael Peat, the keeper of the privy purse, are now paying economic rents - though some have been rewarded with a large salary hike to compensate. The royal staff benefit from a generous non-contributory pension scheme which has just gone up from 18.8% to 20% of salaries. The payment of pensions has now been subsumed in the civil list - which will end scrutiny for the next 10 years. And if inflation remains around 2.5%, a recent parliamentary answer to Alan Williams from Stephen Timms, financial secretary to the Treasury, shows the Queen will still be quids in from the civil list by 2010. It shows she will still have an \u00a38m surplus. Estates of the realm \u0095 Most of the Queen's property, including the royal palaces in London and Windsor, her jewellery, the crown jewels, the royal collection of paintings and even the royal stamp collection are held by the queen as sovereign. She cannot sell them and they must be handed on to her successor. \u0095 The queen does not own the eight state limousines (five Rolls-Royces, three Daimlers) or the royal people carriers (Vauxhall Sintras). But she has a driving licence and owns a Daimler Jaguar saloon and a Vauxhall estate. The Duke of Edinburgh has a Range Rover and a Metrocab for London. \u0095 The royal train is owned and managed by Railtrack. \u0095 Balmoral Castle and the Sandringham estate are owned by the Queen. Both were bought by the royal family in the 1850s and 1860s. Balmoral, a Victorian gothic castle has an estate of 50,000 acres, employing 50 people full-time and 100 part-time. Sandringham, near King's Lynn in Norfolk, is a Victorian mansion with grounds of 60 acres and an estate of nearly 20,000 acres, including tenanted farms, forestry, two studs, a fruit farm and country park, employing 140 full time staff. \u0095 West Ilsley racing stables in Berkshire, and Sunninghill Park near Windsor, where the Duke of York lives, are both owned by the Queen. \u0095 She receives income from the Duchy of Lancaster (estates held in trust for the sovereign since 1399) amounting to \u00a35.7 million before tax in 1997-98. \u0095 She has an investment portfolio, the details of which have not been disclosed but which is taxable. In 1993 the lord chamberlain said rumours that it was worth more than \u00a3100 million were \"grossly overstated\" but if her financial advisers have been doing their job properly it may well might be now.

      "body": "<p>Stalin once told Shostakovich that the Soviet national anthem ought to be a \"good cross-country vehicle\". More than 250 years ago, the British dusted down a cross-country vehicle which now groans like a crude and creaking cart. On a warm clammy September evening in 1745, the audience in the Drury Lane Theatre rose to its feet singing:</p> <p><br>God save our noble King <br>God save great George our King, <br>God save the King. <br>Send him victorious <br>Happy and glorious, <br>God save the King. <br>0 Lord our God arise, <br>Scatter his enemies <br>And make them fall. <br>Confound their politicks, <br>Frustrate their knavish tricks. <br>On him our hopes are fixed <br>O save us all.</p> <p>As Linda Colley shows in her seminal work, Britons, the government of George II was threatened by Charles Edward Stuart's army which had marched from Scotland to Derby and seemed set to overthrow the state. The audience called repeatedly for encores as the protestant nation gathered its strength to resist the Stuart Pretender. The government had blundered and was now panicking - an old Jacobite song - God Save the King, was resurrected and turned into a rousing tribute to the Hanoverian monarch.</p> <p>Drawing on the Psalms, the song combines the wrathful God of Old Testament with whatever British monarch is reigning to affirm the monarchy as sovereign in parliament.</p> <p>Thus a song originally written to praise James II when he faced defeat and invasion by William of Orange, came to affirm the Whig constituional settlement which William's Glorious Revolution inaugurated. Britons were free because succession to the throne was conditional on the monarch belonging to the protestant faith, but as Linda Colley points out the people's allegiance was conditional on the monarch abiding by the constitution.</p> <p>If the Stuarts were restored, then protestantism and the laws of the constituion would be destroyed. What the song says is that a protestant God is watching over his chosen people.</p> <p>The national anthem therefore comes out of that anti-Jacobite anxiety which inspires Samuel Richardson's great epic Clarissa, and which in an earlier generation inspired Defoe's fiction. Robinson Crusoe, The Journel of the Plague Year, and Roxana are all coded, anti-Stuart works. The problem in the year 2000 is that this exclusively protestant militant royalism seems out of date - it survives in the north of Ireland, but in an almost consciously time-warped, over the top manner.</p> <p>Most Britons (how archiac the term is, it sounds like a moment out of one of Mosley's speeches) have forgotten these historical struggles and are bored when reminded of them. With this goes a diminished regard for the concept of Britain and an embarrassment with the name Great Britain.</p> <p>If Britain were finally to break up and Scotland and the north of Ireland, maybe even Wales, were to go their separate ways, what would happen to God Save the Queen? Can many people imagine ever singing God Save the King when Prince Charles ascends the throne?</p> <p>Its comic to contemplate that gravid dreary tune and those claggy lines struggling to rise towards the rafters on whatever ceremonoial and social occasions they are deemed to be appropriate at. Yet nations need national anthems. They need to sing a cross-country vehicle. They need a song which has a utilitarian purpose to serve. Like God Save the Queen, a national anthem is a weapon which aims to rout the opposition.</p> <p>The problem is that while Great Britain still exists - while the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland still exists - what can take the place of the present dreary, archaic, mind-numbing national anthem? Can there be a new and more attractive cross-country vehicle? Asking that question, I imagine a golf buggy or a supermarket trolley. But if there was a great consensual mood throughout the whole nation then could maybe a visionary lyricist emerge to sing the whole nation?</p> <p>But the English feel, so I'm hearing, that they don't have a culture - not a concept I understand but that mood is present now. The English are turning their backs on the protestant British identity which Linda Colley shows was forged between 1707 and 1837, and which served the nation well until very recently.</p> <p>Perhaps some Ulster Kipling will emerge to sing the imperial British nation? But the English won't be listening, or very few of them. Perhaps Van Morrison's Summerhouse in England might be the new anthem? - except it mentions various great Irish writers and would be complex to sing. Maybe Adrian Mitchell could write a new one?

      "bodyText": "Stalin once told Shostakovich that the Soviet national anthem ought to be a \"good cross-country vehicle\". More than 250 years ago, the British dusted down a cross-country vehicle which now groans like a crude and creaking cart. On a warm clammy September evening in 1745, the audience in the Drury Lane Theatre rose to its feet singing: God save our noble King God save great George our King, God save the King. Send him victorious Happy and glorious, God save the King. 0 Lord our God arise, Scatter his enemies And make them fall. Confound their politicks, Frustrate their knavish tricks. On him our hopes are fixed O save us all. As Linda Colley shows in her seminal work, Britons, the government of George II was threatened by Charles Edward Stuart's army which had marched from Scotland to Derby and seemed set to overthrow the state. The audience called repeatedly for encores as the protestant nation gathered its strength to resist the Stuart Pretender. The government had blundered and was now panicking - an old Jacobite song - God Save the King, was resurrected and turned into a rousing tribute to the Hanoverian monarch. Drawing on the Psalms, the song combines the wrathful God of Old Testament with whatever British monarch is reigning to affirm the monarchy as sovereign in parliament. Thus a song originally written to praise James II when he faced defeat and invasion by William of Orange, came to affirm the Whig constituional settlement which William's Glorious Revolution inaugurated. Britons were free because succession to the throne was conditional on the monarch belonging to the protestant faith, but as Linda Colley points out the people's allegiance was conditional on the monarch abiding by the constitution. If the Stuarts were restored, then protestantism and the laws of the constituion would be destroyed. What the song says is that a protestant God is watching over his chosen people. The national anthem therefore comes out of that anti-Jacobite anxiety which inspires Samuel Richardson's great epic Clarissa, and which in an earlier generation inspired Defoe's fiction. Robinson Crusoe, The Journel of the Plague Year, and Roxana are all coded, anti-Stuart works. The problem in the year 2000 is that this exclusively protestant militant royalism seems out of date - it survives in the north of Ireland, but in an almost consciously time-warped, over the top manner. Most Britons (how archiac the term is, it sounds like a moment out of one of Mosley's speeches) have forgotten these historical struggles and are bored when reminded of them. With this goes a diminished regard for the concept of Britain and an embarrassment with the name Great Britain. If Britain were finally to break up and Scotland and the north of Ireland, maybe even Wales, were to go their separate ways, what would happen to God Save the Queen? Can many people imagine ever singing God Save the King when Prince Charles ascends the throne? Its comic to contemplate that gravid dreary tune and those claggy lines struggling to rise towards the rafters on whatever ceremonoial and social occasions they are deemed to be appropriate at. Yet nations need national anthems. They need to sing a cross-country vehicle. They need a song which has a utilitarian purpose to serve. Like God Save the Queen, a national anthem is a weapon which aims to rout the opposition. The problem is that while Great Britain still exists - while the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland still exists - what can take the place of the present dreary, archaic, mind-numbing national anthem? Can there be a new and more attractive cross-country vehicle? Asking that question, I imagine a golf buggy or a supermarket trolley. But if there was a great consensual mood throughout the whole nation then could maybe a visionary lyricist emerge to sing the whole nation? But the English feel, so I'm hearing, that they don't have a culture - not a concept I understand but that mood is present now. The English are turning their backs on the protestant British identity which Linda Colley shows was forged between 1707 and 1837, and which served the nation well until very recently. Perhaps some Ulster Kipling will emerge to sing the imperial British nation? But the English won't be listening, or very few of them. Perhaps Van Morrison's Summerhouse in England might be the new anthem? - except it mentions various great Irish writers and would be complex to sing. Maybe Adrian Mitchell could write a new one? But could he appeal to readers of the Sun and the Mail? Of course the English - the English not the British - have an alternative national anthem, one of the most beautiful lyrics ever written: Blake's Jerusalem. And did those feet in ancient time Walk upon England's mountains green? And was the holy lamb of God On England's pleasant pastures seen? And did the Countenance Divine Shone forth upon our clouded hills? And was Jerusalam builded here Among these dark Satanic mills? Bring me my arrows of desire; Bring me my spear - O Clouds unfold Bring me my chariot of fire! I will not cease from mental flight; Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand, Till we have built Jerusalem, In England's green and pleasant land. Set to music by William Walton during the dark days of the first world war, the visionary idealism of Blake's lyric gave hope and certainty to millions. This is a song which unites conservatives, liberals and the left - it is a completely one-nation poem and its idea of fighting isn't first and foremost martial. Blake is remembering his hero Milton, who had the angels fight in heaven - the war they fight is a war of ideas, a war waged as Milton waged it with the polemicist's pen, not the soldier's sword. True, in times of war Jerusalem says \"we the island nation will fight on the beaches and the cliffs and the streets of our cities\", but it issues from that central creative fire in English culture - the fire of argument, debate and ideas. I remember long years ago when I was an undergraduate, Enoch Powell delivered his notorious rivers of blood speech. As I recall, the then Bishop of Woolwich, the celebrated John Robinson, replied by quoting Blake's Jerusalem and saying that if Christ came back to England today he'd be turned away by immigration officials because of his dark skin. An enterprising journalist asked Powell what he thought of the bishop's remark and Powell replied that it was \"blasphemous\". It was not. What shines through Blake's lines is his embracing of all races, his hatred of the slave trade - his oppposition doesn't sleep. Against Blake's mystical English patriotism, we have Powell's minatory savegery. I remember when Powell died and his body lay in its coffin in a church beside the houses of parliament draped in a Union flag. No one complained.

She will sit on a throne in the House of Lords, surrounded by a sea of tiaras, red robes and ermine and command the House of Commons to attend upon her. The lord chancellor will, on bended knee, hand her a speech setting out the government's programme. The Queen will perch her spectacles upon her nose and begin with the words: \"My government...\"</p> <p>Few of her subjects will, one imagines, be watching this piece of ritual, so heavy with dubious symbolism and history. There will doubtless be a short clip of pageantry on tonight's television news, which will rapidly move on to the subsequent debate. The little royal prelude will be thought by most to be charming, but irrelevant.</p> <p>The \"irrelevant monarchy\" is a common theme amongst royalists, agnostics and even republicans. These days (they argue) the royals are decorative. They have no real power or influence. One may hold them in awe or in contempt, but at a time when we are having to import nurses from Spain and a rail journey from London to Nottingham takes nine hours there are surely more important things to discuss? The opposite case is simultaneously argued by defenders of the crown. This runs: like it or not, the monarchy is embedded in our constitutional arrangements and is, indeed, the only constant. Lords reform is a mess. Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and even England are on a devolutionary journey with no obvious destination. Our institutional relationships with Europe are neurotically fraught and ever fluid. The stability of having the Queen as head of state is - in some views - essential and - in others - a reassuring veil of continuity that allows a government of the left to be more radical than it otherwise could be.</p> <p><b> Deported for life </b><br></p> <p>So the question of who should be our head of state is seldom addressed, and never by our elected representatives. MPs are indeed barred from debating \"the conduct of the sovereign, the heir to the throne or other members of the royal family\". An MP who raised the question of whether Britain might be better off as a republic could be sent to the Tower.</p> <p>A silly bit of decorative irrelevance, of course. Like the Treason Felony Act 1848, which should really be now used by the attorney general against this newspaper, since it threatens that anyone imagining or publishing anything which might lead to the Queen's downfall should be deported for life. For we do question how much longer Britain should remain a monarchy. Today and over the next few days a number of writers argue in these pages that the widespread programme of reform undertaken by this government - the most sweeping since the 1830s - cannot be satisfactorily completed unless we also address the position of who should be head of state, together with the means by which they are appointed.</p> <p>To be clear from the start, nothing we argue is intended to reflect upon the present royal family. As people we may admire them, despise them, pity them or envy them. That is, in a sense, beside the point. The hereditary principle is a lottery. One generation gets a Winston, the next gets a Randolph. One generation gets the Duke of Marlborough, another the Marquess of Blandford.</p> <p>It is fruitless complaining. We have been extraordinarily lucky with the present Queen, who has behaved throughout her reign with considerable dignity and quiet common sense. Who can tell whether Charles has whatever it takes, or William thereafter? Those who support the hereditary principle as a way of selecting our head of state should accept the throw of the dice.</p> <p>The problem is not one particular royal family or one particular royal. The problem is the office itself. Now that Westminster has been purged of most of its earls, dukes, marquesses and viscounts there is a general acknowledgement that the purge was long overdue. The present arrangements are widely agreed to be flawed, but no one at all argues for the return of the hereditaries. That leaves the beached whale of monarchy as the only remaining part of our unwritten constitution dependent on the accident of birth.</p> <p>This is, in itself, indefensible. While much of the rest of our society - its aristocracy, its land, its property, its money, its hierarchies and feudal arrangements - was organised upon hereditary lines, the monarchy comfortably fitted into a wider pattern. Our society is no longer arranged upon these lines and the monarchy no longer fits. But our objections to the continuation of the constitutional monarchy go further. As our writers demonstrate in this series, the crown is far from being an abstract. It lies, like the Rosetta stone, at the centre of our national life. It underpins every aspect of our current set-up - and stands behind most of the flaws or excesses of our system of government.</p> <p>If you think Britain's degree of centralisation is our core problem, blame the crown prerogative which hoards all executive power at the centre, placing it in the hands of the prime minister. If you hate the way parliament has been eclipsed, blame the crown prerogative, which allows a prime minister to govern with barely a nod to MPs. If it is secrecy you loathe, and freedom of information you want, look to the crown - in whose name the executive can act in the dark. If your beef is with Europe, where you believe the council of ministers takes decisions in your name that you never hear about and cannot change, ask with what authority British ministers act: the answer is the crown prerogative.</p> <p>If you dislike the culture of patronage that still informs our politics, with a second chamber stuffed with cronies and monied benefactors of the main parties, then blame the crown: for it is the \"fount of patronage\" from which all honours, titles and largesse flow. Is your local hospital run by people you never voted for and have never seen? That is because Britain is a quango state, with appointees taking crucial decisions over all our lives: they can, thanks to the the power of crown prerogative. If you have ever wondered where our judges come from - people who will be making ever more crucial decisions of life and liberty for all of us - then consider the lord chancellor, able to fill the judiciary in the name of the crown. If you wonder by what authority a prime minister can send British troops to Sierra Leone without troubling MPs to consider the matter themselves, then blame the crown prerogative.</p> <p><b>Accident of birth </b></p> <p>It is a shared view on both left and right that the constitution needs rebalancing. Parliament must be given more powers. Prime ministers and their coteries must be more accountable to parliament. The House of Lords needs more legitimacy. There needs to be profound and far-reaching rebalancing of local power against central power, of national powers against supranational powers. Is it really imaginable that this debate can take place without a word of argument about the crown prerogative, as well as the historical loose ends, legal flummery and the malign constitutional impact (as well as the merits) of monarchy? Nor is it imaginable that the constitutional monarchy could be retained while dismantling crown prerogative. Those closest to the Queen are adamant that the vast edifice of power that is the crown must remain. They say the same about the residual royal prerogatives exercised by the monarch herself: the power to appoint a prime minister and refuse a dissolution of parliament. Both underpin her ability to serve as head of state and cannot be taken away.</p> <p>But the influence of the crown is also cultural, and here, too, there is a need for change. Though we speak of \"an accident of birth\", in fact, little is left to accident with our royal family. The Act of Settlement says that in order to qualify as our head of state you must be an heir of the body of Princess Sophia, electress of Hanover; a protestant in communion with the Church of England; not marry a Roman Catholic; not be adopted and have parents who were married at the time they conceived you. More silly ritual, of course. But do not shine a torch on it too brightly in case the whole foundations crumble. One hundred and thirty-five years after Bagehot, we are still told that daylight and magic do not mix.</p> <p>As things stand, the next king will be asked at his coronation - before a worldwide audience of billions - if he is willing to do \"the utmost of your power to maintain ... the Protestant reform religion established by law\". The question expects the answer yes. But, of course, the answer should be no. Charles mutters about becoming \"defender of faiths\". The Archbishop of York calls for its reform, along with the Act of Settlement. The Scottish Parliament calls for its repeal. The palace says nothing, and nothing happens.</p> <p>This paper's contribution to breaking this logjam is to ask the courts to consider whether the Act of Settlement is compatible with the Human Rights Act. While we are about it, we are also doubtful that the Treason Felony Act is compatible with guarantees on free speech enshrined in Article 10 of the European convention. The legal process should, in itself, provoke a fundamental debate about how precisely the crown wishes to define its future role and whether it is any longer tenable for church and state (not to mention armed forces and the courts) to be united in one person. It will, we predict, be an unalarming and sober debate. When all but a few hereditary peers left the House of Lords, the ravens did not flee the Tower and our rivers did not run uphill. We will learn that we can discuss the monarchy in a similarly level-headed fashion.</p> <p><b>Citizens or subjects? </b></p> <p>Where should that debate go? It seems fruitless to begin by demanding the immediate advent of a republic in Britain: it ain't going to happen. We should begin instead by asking for a referendum about what sort of head of state we should have once the Queen dies. People ought to be able to say whether they would prefer to have an elected head of state or to continue with a monarchy. Do they want to be citizens or subjects? Our poll today shows a predictably confused picture. One in three supports the novel idea of a referendum. Given the choice between Charles and William, there is an even sharper split, with Charles mustering only 49% against 41% for William. People would - by a majority of two to one - much rather think of themselves as citizens than subjects. And there is a clear view - nearly 70% - that the Act of Settlement is objectionable. A referendum - sooner rather than later - should be threatening to no one. If - as seems likely - the royal family were to win public endorsement, it would give them a form of qualified legitimacy they presently struggle to claim. The public should then be asked whether their monarch - even if s/he remains notional head of state - should have any meaningful powers. Our poll suggests that only a small majority - 54% - are in favour of a hereditary monarch keeping any political powers. Stripping them of any formal constitutional links to either church or government would be half the battle won.</p> <p>The younger royals must be acutely aware how uneasily an hereditary monarchy now fits into a Britain that is markedly more egalitarian and pluralistic than when the Queen was crowned. This misfit would doubtless cause any family doomed to assume the role great unhappiness. It is an impossible role and will become increasingly so. Engage with your subjects (the Queen taking tea in a Glasgow tower block) and you risk ridicule as well as (expressing sorrow over Paddington) empathy.</p> <p>Stir up controversy (the Prince of Wales on organic farming, architecture, GM Foods ) and you are indulging in an abuse of power. Remain silent and you become an unaccountable sideshow. Split up with your wife and live with another woman and you mirror all current social trends amongst your fellow citizens. But can you then head a church whose views on divorce and extramarital sex have not yet caught up with the news from the central statistical office?</p> <p>Defenders of the monarchy argue that it retains its appeal and potency by virtue of its ability to reflect a nation to itself. Consider only the official 18th birthday pictures of our future head of state dressed in white tie and Eton tails. Which teenager in the country looked at those pictures and truly saw a reflection of themselves?</p> <p>The Act of Settlement may send an odd message to black, brown, Catholic, Jewish, female, unmarried and Muslim Britons, but the excuse supposedly lies in history. What is the excuse for the William picture? How can those so attuned to the power of symbols be simultaneously so blind to them?</p> <p>We declare our hand: we hope that in time we will move - by democratic consensus - to become a republic. We are gradualists: we accept that it will not happen tomorrow. Let the Queen remain Queen for as long as she lives, or she wishes, or she remains able. But in the meantime there should be a long, vigorous and grown-up debate - both inside and outside parliament - as to who, or what, should succeed her.</p> <p><b>Related stories - news</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407460,00.html\">6 December: Now is the time for change</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407462,00.html\">6 December: Majority want to be citizens not subjects</a></p> <p><b>Related stories - comment</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407471,00.html\">Jonathan Freedland: The people versus the crown</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407470,00.html\">Polly Toynbee: The need to modernise our country</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407341,00.html\">Christopher Hitchens: End of the line</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407484,00.html\">Vernon Bogdanor : The Guardian has got it wrong</a></p> <p><b>Related stories - background</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407239,00.html\">Full text: the act of settlement, 1701</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/graphic/0,5543,407538,00.html\">Cartoon: Steve Bell</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407374,00.html\">How ministers exercise arbitrary power</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407426,00.html\">Ten year deal fit for a Queen</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,2763,407468,00.html\">The Scottish threat</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7c0f2\">Do we need a monarchy?</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,407144,00.html\">What is the civil list - and how much is it worth?</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/quiz/questions/0,5961,407222,00.html\">Quiz: how well do you know your monarchy?</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.icmresearch.co.uk/reviews/pollreviews.htm\" target=\"_new\">Latest ICM polls</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Official British monarchy website</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.republic.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\" http: www.worldfreeinternet.net parliament settlement.htm?\">Full text of the Act of Settlement(from American parliament campaign)</a></p>",

As our writers demonstrate in this series, the crown is far from being an abstract. It lies, like the Rosetta stone, at the centre of our national life. It underpins every aspect of our current set-up - and stands behind most of the flaws or excesses of our system of government. If you think Britain's degree of centralisation is our core problem, blame the crown prerogative which hoards all executive power at the centre, placing it in the hands of the prime minister. If you hate the way parliament has been eclipsed, blame the crown prerogative, which allows a prime minister to govern with barely a nod to MPs. If it is secrecy you loathe, and freedom of information you want, look to the crown - in whose name the executive can act in the dark. If your beef is with Europe, where you believe the council of ministers takes decisions in your name that you never hear about and cannot change, ask with what authority British ministers act: the answer is the crown prerogative. If you dislike the culture of patronage that still informs our politics, with a second chamber stuffed with cronies and monied benefactors of the main parties, then blame the crown: for it is the \"fount of patronage\" from which all honours, titles and largesse flow. Is your local hospital run by people you never voted for and have never seen? That is because Britain is a quango state, with appointees taking crucial decisions over all our lives: they can, thanks to the the power of crown prerogative. If you have ever wondered where our judges come from - people who will be making ever more crucial decisions of life and liberty for all of us - then consider the lord chancellor, able to fill the judiciary in the name of the crown. If you wonder by what authority a prime minister can send British troops to Sierra Leone without troubling MPs to consider the matter themselves, then blame the crown prerogative. Accident of birth It is a shared view on both left and right that the constitution needs rebalancing. Parliament must be given more powers. Prime ministers and their coteries must be more accountable to parliament. The House of Lords needs more legitimacy. There needs to be profound and far-reaching rebalancing of local power against central power, of national powers against supranational powers. Is it really imaginable that this debate can take place without a word of argument about the crown prerogative, as well as the historical loose ends, legal flummery and the malign constitutional impact (as well as the merits) of monarchy? Nor is it imaginable that the constitutional monarchy could be retained while dismantling crown prerogative. Those closest to the Queen are adamant that the vast edifice of power that is the crown must remain. They say the same about the residual royal prerogatives exercised by the monarch herself: the power to appoint a prime minister and refuse a dissolution of parliament. Both underpin her ability to serve as head of state and cannot be taken away. But the influence of the crown is also cultural, and here, too, there is a need for change. Though we speak of \"an accident of birth\", in fact, little is left to accident with our royal family. The Act of Settlement says that in order to qualify as our head of state you must be an heir of the body of Princess Sophia, electress of Hanover; a protestant in communion with the Church of England; not marry a Roman Catholic; not be adopted and have parents who were married at the time they conceived you. More silly ritual, of course. But do not shine a torch on it too brightly in case the whole foundations crumble. One hundred and thirty-five years after Bagehot, we are still told that daylight and magic do not mix. As things stand, the next king will be asked at his coronation - before a worldwide audience of billions - if he is willing to do \"the utmost of your power to maintain ... the Protestant reform religion established by law\". The question expects the answer yes. But, of course, the answer should be no. Charles mutters about becoming \"defender of faiths\". The Archbishop of York calls for its reform, along with the Act of Settlement. The Scottish Parliament calls for its repeal. The palace says nothing, and nothing happens. This paper's contribution to breaking this logjam is to ask the courts to consider whether the Act of Settlement is compatible with the Human Rights Act. While we are about it, we are also doubtful that the Treason Felony Act is compatible with guarantees on free speech enshrined in Article 10 of the European convention. The legal process should, in itself, provoke a fundamental debate about how precisely the crown wishes to define its future role and whether it is any longer tenable for church and state (not to mention armed forces and the courts) to be united in one person. It will, we predict, be an unalarming and sober debate. When all but a few hereditary peers left the House of Lords, the ravens did not flee the Tower and our rivers did not run uphill. We will learn that we can discuss the monarchy in a similarly level-headed fashion. Citizens or subjects? Where should that debate go? It seems fruitless to begin by demanding the immediate advent of a republic in Britain: it ain't going to happen. We should begin instead by asking for a referendum about what sort of head of state we should have once the Queen dies. People ought to be able to say whether they would prefer to have an elected head of state or to continue with a monarchy. Do they want to be citizens or subjects? Our poll today shows a predictably confused picture. One in three supports the novel idea of a referendum. Given the choice between Charles and William, there is an even sharper split, with Charles mustering only 49% against 41% for William. People would - by a majority of two to one - much rather think of themselves as citizens than subjects. And there is a clear view - nearly 70% - that the Act of Settlement is objectionable. A referendum - sooner rather than later - should be threatening to no one. If - as seems likely - the royal family were to win public endorsement, it would give them a form of qualified legitimacy they presently struggle to claim. The public should then be asked whether their monarch - even if s/he remains notional head of state - should have any meaningful powers. Our poll suggests that only a small majority - 54% - are in favour of a hereditary monarch keeping any political powers. Stripping them of any formal constitutional links to either church or government would be half the battle won. The younger royals must be acutely aware how uneasily an hereditary monarchy now fits into a Britain that is markedly more egalitarian and pluralistic than when the Queen was crowned. This misfit would doubtless cause any family doomed to assume the role great unhappiness. It is an impossible role and will become increasingly so. Engage with your subjects (the Queen taking tea in a Glasgow tower block) and you risk ridicule as well as (expressing sorrow over Paddington) empathy. Stir up controversy (the Prince of Wales on organic farming, architecture, GM Foods ) and you are indulging in an abuse of power. Remain silent and you become an unaccountable sideshow. Split up with your wife and live with another woman and you mirror all current social trends amongst your fellow citizens. But can you then head a church whose views on divorce and extramarital sex have not yet caught up with the news from the central statistical office? Defenders of the monarchy argue that it retains its appeal and potency by virtue of its ability to reflect a nation to itself. Consider only the official 18th birthday pictures of our future head of state dressed in white tie and Eton tails. Which teenager in the country looked at those pictures and truly saw a reflection of themselves? The Act of Settlement may send an odd message to black, brown, Catholic, Jewish, female, unmarried and Muslim Britons, but the excuse supposedly lies in history. What is the excuse for the William picture? How can those so attuned to the power of symbols be simultaneously so blind to them? We declare our hand: we hope that in time we will move - by democratic consensus - to become a republic. We are gradualists: we accept that it will not happen tomorrow. Let the Queen remain Queen for as long as she lives, or she wishes, or she remains able. But in the meantime there should be a long, vigorous and grown-up debate - both inside and outside parliament - as to who, or what, should succeed her.

      "body": "<p>The rock star Sting is fighting plans to increase the use of the military air base at Boscombe Down, near Salisbury, where the RAF wants to station its future strategic tanker fleet. As papers from the Guardian through to the Daily Star reported two weeks ago, Sting, his wife Trudie Styler, and some of their neighbours are incensed that the Ministry of Defence can do as it wishes without planning permission (see below). They want a judicial review to force an inquiry. The Star headlined the story: \"Sting's bid to shoot down new air base\".</p> <p>This, though the Star did not say so, was that rare tabloid event, a story about crown prerogative; about a system which spares the crown and its representatives the tiresome constraints which affect the rest of us, like having to get planning permission for your extension. The cushioning, conveniencing, excluding powers of the prerogative crop up throughout our system of government, often with few people knowing that they are there. Its exercise lies close to the heart of whatever in British government is most arbitrary, most secretive, and least accountable.</p> <p>In the time of William the Conqueror the royal prerogative had very few limitations. Over the centuries, in often bloody clashes, much of that was eroded. The 1688 Revolution and the 1700 Act of Settlement curbed the monarch as never before. Today's crown prerogative is simply what's left of a once much larger edifice. In his classic text, The Law and the Constitution, published in 1885, Lord Dicey defined it as \"the residue of the discretionary or arbitrary authority which at any given time is left in the hands of the crown.\" Except that, strictly speaking, it's no longer in the hands of the crown, but the hands of our political masters.</p> <p>It is crown prerogative which enables prime ministers and their chosen subordinates to order the country to war, to make treaties, to give up national territory, to staff the commanding heights of political life, the church and the law, to dish out honours to those who deserve them and some who do not, to keep information from courts even when injustice may result - and possibly in this case to force the pretty, secluded Woodford Valley where Sting has his fine Tudor home to suffer the noise and disruption of an expanded air base.</p> <p>In two crucial areas, the crown still means the monarch. Even today the Queen retains the ancient prerogatives of choosing or dismissing the prime minister and deciding whether or not parliament should be dissolved.</p> <p>In practice these freedoms too are now circumscribed. When Churchill wished to appoint Anthony Eden deputy prime minister, George VI (or his advisers in defence of his interests) objected, since they thought this would circumscribe his right to decide whom he ought to invite to form a government should Churchill die or resign. Today, when a party leader resigns, the party will choose a replacement, and only in the most exceptional circumstances would the palace look for a successor anywhere else.</p> <p>An inconclusive general election would still leave the Queen to decide which party leader to send for. The example of February 1974 shows how delicate that decision might still become. As to dismissing a premier, for a monarch to try to do this in the early 21st century seems inconceivable.</p> <p>But the power is still there, just as it was when the governor-general of Australia, representative of the Queen and using powers dependent on crown prerogative, sacked prime minister Gough Whitlam. The monarch's right to grant or refuse a dissolution came close to being tested a fortnight after the February 1974 election but in most other cases the monarch's participation is now merely picturesque.</p> <p>The power to deny royal assent to legislation remains but has not been used since the reign of Queen Anne. More recently, the Commons, amazingly, had to ask the Queen's permission to choose a new speaker and report back to her on the choice: but that was a mere, if humiliating, formality.</p> <p>Crown prerogative enables governments to fill a huge range of senior appointments in the armed forces, the security services, the civil service and the judiciary, without reference to the people's representatives, though also, in most cases, without anything more than a token reference to the monarch whom they are said to be serving. It is still the Queen's commission, the Queen's pardon when prisoners are released, the Queen's pleasure when they are jailed sine die, Queen's Counsel to plead in the courts, royal commissions to inquire into weighty issues, a royal charter to govern the BBC and a Royal Mail to carry the post. But the will which drives the institution is that of Downing Street, not the palace.</p> <p>The Queen, as head of the Church of England, appoints archbishops and bishops, but no longer in the sense of the order sent by the King to the monks of Winchester: \"We order you to hold a free election, and forbid you to elect anyone except Richard my clerk the Archdeacon of Poitiers\". Tony Blair's preference, like Margaret Thatcher's before him, is more decisive now than Her Majesty's.</p> <p>Crown prerogative despatches our troops to wars and emergencies. On May 11, 1982, early in the Falklands emergency (which never attained the official status of war) the Labour leader, Michael Foot, argued that the House of Commons had a right to make a judgment on the matter before any decision was taken which would deepen the conflict. Margaret Thatcher would have none of that. \"It is an inherent jurisdiction of the government to negotiate and reach decisions,\" she told the commons. \"Afterwards the House of Commons can pass judgment on the government.\"</p> <p>The same system has applied under Tony Blair with Sierra Leone, with former Yugoslavia, and now, it may be, the Middle East. Again in the Falklands emergency, crown prerogative enabled private ships to be requisitioned and sent to the South Atlantic - just as in the second world war crown prerogative had enabled the war office to evacuate the village of Imber, high on Salisbury Plain not far from Boscombe Down, on the ground that the war effort needed it. It is still, battered and derelict, in the hands of the army today.</p> <p>Using crown prerogative, ministers can commit the nation to treaties of which no text may have been published, let alone debated in parliament. Using these procedures, the Attlee government committed us to nuclear weapons; American bases were established here without the sanction of parliament; Edward Heath committed us to membership of the European Community on the basis that parliament would agree later on.</p> <p>The honours system depends on crown prerogative. Not only do MPs have no say in the matter; they cannot even criticise the decisions taken in the name of the crown unless they put down a substantive Commons motion (and even then they cannot ensure that it gets debated). Except for the benches occupied by those hereditary peers who survived in the recent purge, the bishops and the law lords, seats in the Lords are filled on the say-so of Downing Street under crown prerogative.</p> <p>Under crown prerogative, ministers can grant public immunity certificates which enable them to withhold from the courts information which others might judge was crucial - a routine practice belatedly exposed to the light by the Scott inquiry. Under crown prerogative, the health and safety executive cannot issue statutory improvement or prohibition notices in royal palaces or other crown in stitutions, nor can it prosecute employers here as it would elsewhere. Instead, it can issue censures, which are not the same thing.</p> <p>This list is very far from exhaustive. There are other cases too, especially in the controls which governments exercise over freedom of movement, where the operation of crown prerogative seems plainly destructive of human rights. You will find the full, unprepossessing picture in an excellent book by <a href=\"#vincenzi\">Christopher Vincenzi</a> to which this survey is deeply indebted.</p> <p>But here is the good news. Crown prerogative can be, and is being, rolled back. It helps if there is an outcry against the way it frustrates a clear public interest, as in the case of the Stanley Royd hospital, Wakefield, where facts were revealed which produced a successful parliamentary campaign to remove crown immunity in such places. As Dicey said, crown prerogative is a residuum. Where statutes exist, it retreats. As the House of Lords was to rule in 1988 in another case where a government sought to avoid paying compensation: \"The constitutional history of this country is the history of the prerogative powers of the crown being made subject to the overriding powers of the democratically elected legislature as the sovereign body. The prerogative powers of the crown remain in existence to the extent to which parliament has not expressly or by implication extinguished them.\" Legislation - like the bill which incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, and now the Human Rights Act (which Sting and his friends hope to invoke in the matter of Boscombe Down) - has taken that progress much further.</p> <p>The sweep of the prerogative has been curbed in other ways too. One is judicial review. Until 1985 the courts were always cautious about subjecting decisions taken by politicians to judicial examination. When in 1977 a Labour home secretary, Merlyn Rees, sought to deport the American born journalist, Mark Hosenball, Lord Denning declared, in a judgment embodying the understanding of the previous age: \"There is a conflict here between the interests of national security on the one hand and the freedom of the individual on the other. The balance ... is not for a court of law. It is for the home secretary. ... He is answerable to parliament as to the way in which he did it and not to the courts.\"</p> <p>Politicians do not get off so lightly now, as Michael Howard, a Conservative home secretary time and again overturned in the courts, could testify. The Thatcher government withdrew the right to union recognition at the government intelligence centre GCHQ. That was challenged as an infringement of employees' rights. Once that might have been the end of the matter. The courts would have left it alone. But by now (1985) a majority of in the Lords thought otherwise. \"I am unable\" Lord Roskill said, \"to see ... that there is any logical reason why the fact that the source of the power is the prerogative and not statute should today deprive the citizen of that right of challenge to the manner of its exercise which he would possess were the source of power statutory. In either case the act in question is the act of the executive. To talk of that act as the act of the sovereign savours of the archaism of past centuries.\"</p> <p>With the courts increasingly widening their definition of where they can intervene, applications for judicial review quadrupled in the 12 years from 1980 onwards.</p> <p>Then there is Europe - diminishing both the range of crown prerogative but without transferring control to the people's elected representatives. Just as statute shoulders the prerogative out of the way, so law made in Europe, which overrides laws made in member countries, trumps the prerogative too.</p> <p>Yet, eroded though prerogative power has been, it remains a formidable weapon in the hands of those who govern us. \"We are told that power has moved over time from the throne to the Lords, from the Lords to the commons and from the commons to the people,\" writes the Labour MP and former senior minister <a href=\"#benn\">Tony Benn</a>, who more than any other MP has made this cause his own. \"But in practice power has now moved to the prime minister who then, exercising the powers of the crown without explicit consent from parliament, dominates the whole system.\" His solution is simple: \"The House of Commons is the only elected part of Parliament and democratic principles should require that all prerogative powers be controlled by that house.\"</p> <p>That, on the face of it, would seem likely to impose a burden on parliament which parliament, as at present constituted, would be ill-equipped to bear.</p> <p>But the sense that the prerogative should progressively be transferred from crown to people is by no means confined to the Labour left. \"The royal prerogative has no place in a modern western democracy,\" one eager reformer wrote in a <a href=\"#manifesto\">Charter 88 manifesto</a> six years ago. \"Only part of our constitutional arrangement has ever been formally endorsed by parliament. The rest derives from the royal prerogative... Accountability of the executive is fundamental to any democracy.</p> <p>\"Where power is based not upon statute but upon the royal prerogative it is this accountability which suffers... Over time - and it is bound to take time - we should aim for a situation where all powers exercised by the executive, and by the monarch, are based upon statute, sometimes (as with voting systems) reinforced by direct decisions of the electorate through referenda.\"</p> <p>The name of this firebrand? Jack Straw.</p> <p><b>How prerogative thwarts democracy</b><br></p> <p>Boscombe Down air base is on the edge of the Woodford Valley, north of Salisbury. Among other local properties likely to be affected by expansion is Heale House and gardens, once used as a military rehabilitation centre. If it was a civil air base, this kind of expansion would trigger a public inquiry (the Heathrow inquiry has been running since 1995).</p> <p>As it is, the MoD is required under the terms of a 1984 government guidance document known as 18/84, to put its plans before Salisbury District Council, the planning authority, in exactly the same way as it would do if crown prerogative did not apply. But all the council can do is to give advice: it cannot rule one way or the other. At present the council is collecting local opinions and hopes to formulate a view after Christmas. Should the government choose to ignore a council objection, that would be that. Sting and his neighbours plan to invoke the Human Rights Act and seek a judicial review to force an inquiry.</p> <p><b>Choosing a PM</b><br> In February 1974, Edward Heath lost his majority in the Commons but Harold Wilson was left without a majority either. Though Labour had more seats than the Conservatives, Heath tried to reach an arrangement with the Liberal leader, Jeremy Thorpe, to keep his place as prime minister, sustained by Liberal support and possibly coalition. In the end, with much of his party hostile, Thorpe declined.</p> <p>Had a deal been done, the palace would have had to decide whether to let Heath form a government, or whether to let Harold Wilson, as leader of the largest party, take his chance first. On March 14, faced with Conservative and Liberal obstruction, Wilson made a speech at High Wycombe in which he said: \"If Mr Heath and Mr Thorpe are determined to play the role of wreckers ... they and their parties will not be immune from the consequences of their own frivolous irresponsibility.\" This was construed as a threat to seek a dissolution and fresh elections. The Labour Left had been arguing that the palace would have no option but to agree, but most constitutional experts disagreed.</p> <p>The Queen's advisers would be bound to ask if a dissolution was entirely necessary, and whether the government might be continued by other means - such as a Conservative-Liberal coalition or a Labour leader other than Wilson. In the event, Wilson's opponents backed down.</p> <p><b>Health regulation </b><br> A salmonella outbreak at the Stanley Royd Hospital, Wakefield, in August 1984 caused 19 deaths and infected over 300 other patients. There were calls for prosecution, but because hospitals were covered by crown immunity, this was said to be impossible. An official inquiry later found the issue of crown immunity was irrelevant, but in the meantime many other complaints about unhygienic and unhealthy conditions in hospitals emerged. The Institute of Environmental Heath Officers cited 97 cases where prosecutions would have been instituted but for crown immunity. A private member's bill to end this protection was introduced by the Conservative backbench MP Richard Shepherd, but the government undertook to introduce its own bill and crown immunity status was ended.</p> <p><b>Giving evidence</b><br></p> <p>Under a system known until 1973 merely as \"crown privilege\", ministers may issue certificates allowing them to deny access to certain documents to parties in legal proceedings on the grounds that disclosure would be against the public interest or would interfere with the proper functioning of the public service.</p> <p>This was also extended to cover classes of document, which could be withheld even though it could not be shown that disclosure would be harmful in a specific case. In the Matrix Churchill case, which subsequently became part of the issues examined by the Scott inquiry, four ministers refused the defence access to inter-departmental minutes which they believed would show that what the company was doing was known to the security services. One of them, Michael Heseltine, at first refused to sign the certificate, arguing that no rational person could dispute that they should be disclosed.</p> <p>But the attorney general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, persuaded him that he had no option but to sign. Sir Richard Scott, condemning the government's handling of the matter, said these arguments were \"absurd\". He said the law should be amended. The attorney general announced in December 1996 that the government would no longer claim immunity on a class basis and certificates would only be used when disclosure would cause \"real damage or harm\".</p> <p><b> Filling top jobs</b><br></p> <p>In August 1998, two new law lords were appointed: Lord Justice Millett (Harrow, Cambridge, 66 at the time of appointment) and Lord Justice Hobhouse (Eton, Oxford, 66 at the time of appointment). On the basis of secret soundings with senior judges, the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, recommended them to the prime minister, who put their names to the Queen. In opposition, Labour promised to open the system up through an independent judicial appointments comission. In government it has maintained the existing system.</p> <p>In April 2000, the Conservative party treasurer Michael Ashscroft, who was also his party's principal donor, was made a peer on the recommendation of the Conservative leader William Hague. The name was forwarded to the palace by the prime minister. Several big contributors to Labour Party funds had been honoured too. But the leader of the lords, Baroness Jay, said Labour's appointments were not in the same league as Mr Ashcroft. \"The stinking nomination, if you want to put it in those terms, is from Mr Hague,\" she said. The former Conservative leader in the Lords, Lord Cranborne, described the nomination as \"an affront to the dignity and standing\" of parliament. Lord Nolan, chairman of the committee on standards in public life, said his committee might wish to investigate charges that honours were linked with party funding.</p> <p><b> Footnotes:</b> <a name=\"vincenzi\">1</a> Crown Powers, Subjects and Citizens.

This, though the Star did not say so, was that rare tabloid event, a story about crown prerogative; about a system which spares the crown and its representatives the tiresome constraints which affect the rest of us, like having to get planning permission for your extension. The cushioning, conveniencing, excluding powers of the prerogative crop up throughout our system of government, often with few people knowing that they are there. Its exercise lies close to the heart of whatever in British government is most arbitrary, most secretive, and least accountable. In the time of William the Conqueror the royal prerogative had very few limitations. Over the centuries, in often bloody clashes, much of that was eroded. The 1688 Revolution and the 1700 Act of Settlement curbed the monarch as never before. Today's crown prerogative is simply what's left of a once much larger edifice. In his classic text, The Law and the Constitution, published in 1885, Lord Dicey defined it as \"the residue of the discretionary or arbitrary authority which at any given time is left in the hands of the crown.\" Except that, strictly speaking, it's no longer in the hands of the crown, but the hands of our political masters. It is crown prerogative which enables prime ministers and their chosen subordinates to order the country to war, to make treaties, to give up national territory, to staff the commanding heights of political life, the church and the law, to dish out honours to those who deserve them and some who do not, to keep information from courts even when injustice may result - and possibly in this case to force the pretty, secluded Woodford Valley where Sting has his fine Tudor home to suffer the noise and disruption of an expanded air base. In two crucial areas, the crown still means the monarch. Even today the Queen retains the ancient prerogatives of choosing or dismissing the prime minister and deciding whether or not parliament should be dissolved. In practice these freedoms too are now circumscribed. When Churchill wished to appoint Anthony Eden deputy prime minister, George VI (or his advisers in defence of his interests) objected, since they thought this would circumscribe his right to decide whom he ought to invite to form a government should Churchill die or resign. Today, when a party leader resigns, the party will choose a replacement, and only in the most exceptional circumstances would the palace look for a successor anywhere else. An inconclusive general election would still leave the Queen to decide which party leader to send for. The example of February 1974 shows how delicate that decision might still become. As to dismissing a premier, for a monarch to try to do this in the early 21st century seems inconceivable. But the power is still there, just as it was when the governor-general of Australia, representative of the Queen and using powers dependent on crown prerogative, sacked prime minister Gough Whitlam. The monarch's right to grant or refuse a dissolution came close to being tested a fortnight after the February 1974 election but in most other cases the monarch's participation is now merely picturesque. The power to deny royal assent to legislation remains but has not been used since the reign of Queen Anne. More recently, the Commons, amazingly, had to ask the Queen's permission to choose a new speaker and report back to her on the choice: but that was a mere, if humiliating, formality. Crown prerogative enables governments to fill a huge range of senior appointments in the armed forces, the security services, the civil service and the judiciary, without reference to the people's representatives, though also, in most cases, without anything more than a token reference to the monarch whom they are said to be serving. It is still the Queen's commission, the Queen's pardon when prisoners are released, the Queen's pleasure when they are jailed sine die, Queen's Counsel to plead in the courts, royal commissions to inquire into weighty issues, a royal charter to govern the BBC and a Royal Mail to carry the post. But the will which drives the institution is that of Downing Street, not the palace. The Queen, as head of the Church of England, appoints archbishops and bishops, but no longer in the sense of the order sent by the King to the monks of Winchester: \"We order you to hold a free election, and forbid you to elect anyone except Richard my clerk the Archdeacon of Poitiers\". Tony Blair's preference, like Margaret Thatcher's before him, is more decisive now than Her Majesty's. Crown prerogative despatches our troops to wars and emergencies. On May 11, 1982, early in the Falklands emergency (which never attained the official status of war) the Labour leader, Michael Foot, argued that the House of Commons had a right to make a judgment on the matter before any decision was taken which would deepen the conflict. Margaret Thatcher would have none of that. \"It is an inherent jurisdiction of the government to negotiate and reach decisions,\" she told the commons. \"Afterwards the House of Commons can pass judgment on the government.\" The same system has applied under Tony Blair with Sierra Leone, with former Yugoslavia, and now, it may be, the Middle East. Again in the Falklands emergency, crown prerogative enabled private ships to be requisitioned and sent to the South Atlantic - just as in the second world war crown prerogative had enabled the war office to evacuate the village of Imber, high on Salisbury Plain not far from Boscombe Down, on the ground that the war effort needed it. It is still, battered and derelict, in the hands of the army today. Using crown prerogative, ministers can commit the nation to treaties of which no text may have been published, let alone debated in parliament. Using these procedures, the Attlee government committed us to nuclear weapons; American bases were established here without the sanction of parliament; Edward Heath committed us to membership of the European Community on the basis that parliament would agree later on. The honours system depends on crown prerogative. Not only do MPs have no say in the matter; they cannot even criticise the decisions taken in the name of the crown unless they put down a substantive Commons motion (and even then they cannot ensure that it gets debated). Except for the benches occupied by those hereditary peers who survived in the recent purge, the bishops and the law lords, seats in the Lords are filled on the say-so of Downing Street under crown prerogative. Under crown prerogative, ministers can grant public immunity certificates which enable them to withhold from the courts information which others might judge was crucial - a routine practice belatedly exposed to the light by the Scott inquiry. Under crown prerogative, the health and safety executive cannot issue statutory improvement or prohibition notices in royal palaces or other crown in stitutions, nor can it prosecute employers here as it would elsewhere. Instead, it can issue censures, which are not the same thing. This list is very far from exhaustive. There are other cases too, especially in the controls which governments exercise over freedom of movement, where the operation of crown prerogative seems plainly destructive of human rights. You will find the full, unprepossessing picture in an excellent book by Christopher Vincenzi to which this survey is deeply indebted. But here is the good news. Crown prerogative can be, and is being, rolled back. It helps if there is an outcry against the way it frustrates a clear public interest, as in the case of the Stanley Royd hospital, Wakefield, where facts were revealed which produced a successful parliamentary campaign to remove crown immunity in such places. As Dicey said, crown prerogative is a residuum. Where statutes exist, it retreats. As the House of Lords was to rule in 1988 in another case where a government sought to avoid paying compensation: \"The constitutional history of this country is the history of the prerogative powers of the crown being made subject to the overriding powers of the democratically elected legislature as the sovereign body. The prerogative powers of the crown remain in existence to the extent to which parliament has not expressly or by implication extinguished them.\" Legislation - like the bill which incorporated the European Convention on Human Rights into British law, and now the Human Rights Act (which Sting and his friends hope to invoke in the matter of Boscombe Down) - has taken that progress much further. The sweep of the prerogative has been curbed in other ways too. One is judicial review. Until 1985 the courts were always cautious about subjecting decisions taken by politicians to judicial examination. When in 1977 a Labour home secretary, Merlyn Rees, sought to deport the American born journalist, Mark Hosenball, Lord Denning declared, in a judgment embodying the understanding of the previous age: \"There is a conflict here between the interests of national security on the one hand and the freedom of the individual on the other. The balance ... is not for a court of law. It is for the home secretary. ... He is answerable to parliament as to the way in which he did it and not to the courts.\" Politicians do not get off so lightly now, as Michael Howard, a Conservative home secretary time and again overturned in the courts, could testify. The Thatcher government withdrew the right to union recognition at the government intelligence centre GCHQ. That was challenged as an infringement of employees' rights. Once that might have been the end of the matter. The courts would have left it alone. But by now (1985) a majority of in the Lords thought otherwise. \"I am unable\" Lord Roskill said, \"to see ... that there is any logical reason why the fact that the source of the power is the prerogative and not statute should today deprive the citizen of that right of challenge to the manner of its exercise which he would possess were the source of power statutory. In either case the act in question is the act of the executive. To talk of that act as the act of the sovereign savours of the archaism of past centuries.\" With the courts increasingly widening their definition of where they can intervene, applications for judicial review quadrupled in the 12 years from 1980 onwards. Then there is Europe - diminishing both the range of crown prerogative but without transferring control to the people's elected representatives. Just as statute shoulders the prerogative out of the way, so law made in Europe, which overrides laws made in member countries, trumps the prerogative too. Yet, eroded though prerogative power has been, it remains a formidable weapon in the hands of those who govern us. \"We are told that power has moved over time from the throne to the Lords, from the Lords to the commons and from the commons to the people,\" writes the Labour MP and former senior minister Tony Benn, who more than any other MP has made this cause his own. \"But in practice power has now moved to the prime minister who then, exercising the powers of the crown without explicit consent from parliament, dominates the whole system.\" His solution is simple: \"The House of Commons is the only elected part of Parliament and democratic principles should require that all prerogative powers be controlled by that house.\" That, on the face of it, would seem likely to impose a burden on parliament which parliament, as at present constituted, would be ill-equipped to bear. But the sense that the prerogative should progressively be transferred from crown to people is by no means confined to the Labour left. \"The royal prerogative has no place in a modern western democracy,\" one eager reformer wrote in a Charter 88 manifesto six years ago. \"Only part of our constitutional arrangement has ever been formally endorsed by parliament. The rest derives from the royal prerogative... Accountability of the executive is fundamental to any democracy. \"Where power is based not upon statute but upon the royal prerogative it is this accountability which suffers... Over time - and it is bound to take time - we should aim for a situation where all powers exercised by the executive, and by the monarch, are based upon statute, sometimes (as with voting systems) reinforced by direct decisions of the electorate through referenda.\" The name of this firebrand? Jack Straw. How prerogative thwarts democracy Boscombe Down air base is on the edge of the Woodford Valley, north of Salisbury. Among other local properties likely to be affected by expansion is Heale House and gardens, once used as a military rehabilitation centre. If it was a civil air base, this kind of expansion would trigger a public inquiry (the Heathrow inquiry has been running since 1995). As it is, the MoD is required under the terms of a 1984 government guidance document known as 18/84, to put its plans before Salisbury District Council, the planning authority, in exactly the same way as it would do if crown prerogative did not apply. But all the council can do is to give advice: it cannot rule one way or the other. At present the council is collecting local opinions and hopes to formulate a view after Christmas. Should the government choose to ignore a council objection, that would be that. Sting and his neighbours plan to invoke the Human Rights Act and seek a judicial review to force an inquiry. Choosing a PM In February 1974, Edward Heath lost his majority in the Commons but Harold Wilson was left without a majority either. Though Labour had more seats than the Conservatives, Heath tried to reach an arrangement with the Liberal leader, Jeremy Thorpe, to keep his place as prime minister, sustained by Liberal support and possibly coalition. In the end, with much of his party hostile, Thorpe declined. Had a deal been done, the palace would have had to decide whether to let Heath form a government, or whether to let Harold Wilson, as leader of the largest party, take his chance first. On March 14, faced with Conservative and Liberal obstruction, Wilson made a speech at High Wycombe in which he said: \"If Mr Heath and Mr Thorpe are determined to play the role of wreckers ... they and their parties will not be immune from the consequences of their own frivolous irresponsibility.\" This was construed as a threat to seek a dissolution and fresh elections. The Labour Left had been arguing that the palace would have no option but to agree, but most constitutional experts disagreed. The Queen's advisers would be bound to ask if a dissolution was entirely necessary, and whether the government might be continued by other means - such as a Conservative-Liberal coalition or a Labour leader other than Wilson. In the event, Wilson's opponents backed down. Health regulation A salmonella outbreak at the Stanley Royd Hospital, Wakefield, in August 1984 caused 19 deaths and infected over 300 other patients. There were calls for prosecution, but because hospitals were covered by crown immunity, this was said to be impossible. An official inquiry later found the issue of crown immunity was irrelevant, but in the meantime many other complaints about unhygienic and unhealthy conditions in hospitals emerged. The Institute of Environmental Heath Officers cited 97 cases where prosecutions would have been instituted but for crown immunity. A private member's bill to end this protection was introduced by the Conservative backbench MP Richard Shepherd, but the government undertook to introduce its own bill and crown immunity status was ended. Giving evidence Under a system known until 1973 merely as \"crown privilege\", ministers may issue certificates allowing them to deny access to certain documents to parties in legal proceedings on the grounds that disclosure would be against the public interest or would interfere with the proper functioning of the public service. This was also extended to cover classes of document, which could be withheld even though it could not be shown that disclosure would be harmful in a specific case. In the Matrix Churchill case, which subsequently became part of the issues examined by the Scott inquiry, four ministers refused the defence access to inter-departmental minutes which they believed would show that what the company was doing was known to the security services. One of them, Michael Heseltine, at first refused to sign the certificate, arguing that no rational person could dispute that they should be disclosed. But the attorney general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, persuaded him that he had no option but to sign. Sir Richard Scott, condemning the government's handling of the matter, said these arguments were \"absurd\". He said the law should be amended. The attorney general announced in December 1996 that the government would no longer claim immunity on a class basis and certificates would only be used when disclosure would cause \"real damage or harm\". Filling top jobs In August 1998, two new law lords were appointed: Lord Justice Millett (Harrow, Cambridge, 66 at the time of appointment) and Lord Justice Hobhouse (Eton, Oxford, 66 at the time of appointment). On the basis of secret soundings with senior judges, the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, recommended them to the prime minister, who put their names to the Queen. In opposition, Labour promised to open the system up through an independent judicial appointments comission. In government it has maintained the existing system. In April 2000, the Conservative party treasurer Michael Ashscroft, who was also his party's principal donor, was made a peer on the recommendation of the Conservative leader William Hague. The name was forwarded to the palace by the prime minister. Several big contributors to Labour Party funds had been honoured too. But the leader of the lords, Baroness Jay, said Labour's appointments were not in the same league as Mr Ashcroft. \"The stinking nomination, if you want to put it in those terms, is from Mr Hague,\" she said. The former Conservative leader in the Lords, Lord Cranborne, described the nomination as \"an affront to the dignity and standing\" of parliament. Lord Nolan, chairman of the committee on standards in public life, said his committee might wish to investigate charges that honours were linked with party funding.

      "body": "<p>In June, St James Palace released a set of photographs in honour of Prince William's 18th birthday. A mixture of action shots and black and white portraits, they laboured to present him as a boy fluent in the routines of his generation: exam practice, team sports, computer literacy. He was even captured masterminding a chicken paella.</p> <p>The photo most eagerly reproduced, however, was a shot taken outside the prince's house at Eton, in which he wore the traditional white tie and black tails of the school uniform, plus a waistcoat he had picked out himself.</p> <p>This, one suspected, was the designated \"fun\" shot, the one the palace hoped would appeal to the prince's peers. The union flag waistcoat bore echoes of the Spice Girls and was imprinted with the catch phrase, \"Groovy Baby\" from the film Austin Powers. Here, it begged, was a prince who did not take himself too seriously and was at ease with popular culture.</p> <p>The first conclusion to be drawn from this, is that the public relations people at the palace are as estranged from reality as the royal family itself. Even without the absurd Eton uniform, the waistcoat made William look like one of those flag-happy wackos who attend last night of the proms. A prince clad in the colours of his national flag is like Madonna wearing a Madonna t-shirt: too self-conscious to be written off as irony.</p> <p>William looked witless and a bit stuffy, hands dallying in his pinstriped pockets, empire stamped across his chest like a statement of intent. The Groovy Baby motif tried to rescue him from smugness, but you can't be subversive in an Eton uniform and the most it could pull off was a sort of benign gormlessness. It was the kind of effort teenage girls routinely denounce as \"tragic\".</p> <p>This wouldn't have mattered much had the photo not been submitted as evidence of how far the royal family has come since Charles was unveiled as an unhappy 18 year old, riven from his peer group by a narrow upbringing and a time warp wardrobe. Here was William, handsome, self-assured, individualistic, exercising sartorial choice as a member of the school's prefect elite who, in keeping with custom, can choose their own waistcoats.</p> <p>Mmm, did no one at the palace reckon this to be a bit far removed from the audience it was appealing to? Was there no one to point out that the black swallowtail coat, white oxford cloth shirt, waistcoat, and pinstriped trousers was a fatigue that conflicted with the project of selling the prince as a regular fella?</p> <p>All the public asks is that the royal family shows some sign of inhabiting the same planet as the rest of us, and they oblige with a boy who goes to the movies, listens to Britney Spears and bears as much resemblance to the average 18 year old as an Edwardian in mourning dress.</p> <p>Here are some of the people who have a claim to the British throne.</p> <p>Descendants of Queen Elizabeth II (b 1926) r 1952- :</p> <p><b>1 </b> Prince Charles, Prince of Wales (b 1948)<br> <b> 2 </b>Prince William of Wales (b 1982) <br> <b> 3 </b> Prince Henry of Wales (b 1984)<br> <b> 4 </b> Prince Andrew, Duke of York (b 1960) <br><b> 5 </b> Princess Beatrice of York (b 1988) <br><b> 6 </b>Princess Eugenie of York (b 1990) <br> <b> 7 </b> Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex (b 1964) <br> <b> 8 </b>Princess Anne, Princess Royal (b 1950) <br> <b> 9 </b>Peter Phillips (b 1977) <br><b> 10 </b> Zara Phillips (b 1981)<br></p> <p>Descendants of King George VI (1895-1952) r 1936-1952:</p> <p><b>11</b> Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon (b 1930) <br> <b> 12 </b> David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley (b 1961) <br> <b> 13 </b> Honourable Charles Armstrong-Jones (b 1999) <br> <b> 14 </b> Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones (b 1964) <br> <b> 15 </b> Samuel Chatto (b 1996) <br> <b> 16 </b> Arthur Chatto (b 1999) <br></p> <p>But there are 613 in all: numbers 17-53 in the line of succession are the descendants of King George V (1865-1936, r 1910-1936); 54-80 are descendants of King Edward VII (1841-1910, r 1901-1910); and 81-613 are descendants of Queen Victoria (1819-1901 r 1837-1901).

      "bodyText": "In June, St James Palace released a set of photographs in honour of Prince William's 18th birthday. A mixture of action shots and black and white portraits, they laboured to present him as a boy fluent in the routines of his generation: exam practice, team sports, computer literacy. He was even captured masterminding a chicken paella. The photo most eagerly reproduced, however, was a shot taken outside the prince's house at Eton, in which he wore the traditional white tie and black tails of the school uniform, plus a waistcoat he had picked out himself. This, one suspected, was the designated \"fun\" shot, the one the palace hoped would appeal to the prince's peers. The union flag waistcoat bore echoes of the Spice Girls and was imprinted with the catch phrase, \"Groovy Baby\" from the film Austin Powers. Here, it begged, was a prince who did not take himself too seriously and was at ease with popular culture. The first conclusion to be drawn from this, is that the public relations people at the palace are as estranged from reality as the royal family itself. Even without the absurd Eton uniform, the waistcoat made William look like one of those flag-happy wackos who attend last night of the proms. A prince clad in the colours of his national flag is like Madonna wearing a Madonna t-shirt: too self-conscious to be written off as irony. William looked witless and a bit stuffy, hands dallying in his pinstriped pockets, empire stamped across his chest like a statement of intent. The Groovy Baby motif tried to rescue him from smugness, but you can't be subversive in an Eton uniform and the most it could pull off was a sort of benign gormlessness. It was the kind of effort teenage girls routinely denounce as \"tragic\". This wouldn't have mattered much had the photo not been submitted as evidence of how far the royal family has come since Charles was unveiled as an unhappy 18 year old, riven from his peer group by a narrow upbringing and a time warp wardrobe. Here was William, handsome, self-assured, individualistic, exercising sartorial choice as a member of the school's prefect elite who, in keeping with custom, can choose their own waistcoats. Mmm, did no one at the palace reckon this to be a bit far removed from the audience it was appealing to? Was there no one to point out that the black swallowtail coat, white oxford cloth shirt, waistcoat, and pinstriped trousers was a fatigue that conflicted with the project of selling the prince as a regular fella? All the public asks is that the royal family shows some sign of inhabiting the same planet as the rest of us, and they oblige with a boy who goes to the movies, listens to Britney Spears and bears as much resemblance to the average 18 year old as an Edwardian in mourning dress. Here are some of the people who have a claim to the British throne. Descendants of Queen Elizabeth II (b 1926) r 1952- : 1 Prince Charles, Prince of Wales (b 1948) 2 Prince William of Wales (b 1982) 3 Prince Henry of Wales (b 1984) 4 Prince Andrew, Duke of York (b 1960) 5 Princess Beatrice of York (b 1988) 6 Princess Eugenie of York (b 1990) 7 Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex (b 1964) 8 Princess Anne, Princess Royal (b 1950) 9 Peter Phillips (b 1977) 10 Zara Phillips (b 1981) Descendants of King George VI (1895-1952) r 1936-1952: 11 Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon (b 1930) 12 David Armstrong-Jones, Viscount Linley (b 1961) 13 Honourable Charles Armstrong-Jones (b 1999) 14 Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones (b 1964) 15 Samuel Chatto (b 1996) 16 Arthur Chatto (b 1999) But there are 613 in all: numbers 17-53 in the line of succession are the descendants of King George V (1865-1936, r 1910-1936); 54-80 are descendants of King Edward VII (1841-1910, r 1901-1910); and 81-613 are descendants of Queen Victoria (1819-1901 r 1837-1901). Some, however, are deemed to be disqualified because of marriage to a Roman Catholic, conversion to catholicism, being born to unmarried parents or having been adopted. Others are not listed at all for the same reasons. These are the unfortunate ones, together with their, or their relevant parent's, place in the list. 22 George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews (b 1962) is married to a Roman Catholic. This will has cause him to lose his place in the line of succession 30 Prince Michael of Kent (b 1942) is married to a Roman Catholic. 40 George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood (b 1923). George's youngest son, Honourable Mark Lascelles (b 1964), is not listed in the order of succession because he was born before his parents' marriage. 41 David Lascelles, Viscount Lascelles (b 1950). David's two eldest children, Honourable Emily Lascelles (b 1975) and Honourable Benjamin Lascelles (b 1978), were born before their parents' marriage 44 Honourable James Lascelles (b 1953). James's younger daughter, Tanit Lascelles (b 1981), was born before her parents' marriage 52 Henry Lascelles (b 1953). Henry's half-brother, Martin Lascelles (b 1962), was born before his parents were married. 64 Haakon Lorentzen (b 1954) is married to a Roman Catholic. 68 Ingeborg Lorentzen (b 1957) is married to a Roman Catholic. 72 Alexander Ferner (b 1965). Alexander's elder child, Edward Ferner (b 1996), was born before his parents' marriage 81 Michael, King of Romania (b 1921), a descendant of Queen Victoria, is not shown in most order of succession lists because of his marriage to a Roman Catholic. 91 Princess Marie of Romania (b 1964) is also married to a Roman Catholic. 92 Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia (Alexander II, Titular King of Yugoslavia, b 1945) is not usually shown because of his (first) marriage to a Roman Catholic 105 Princess Tatiana of Yugoslavia (b 1957). Her half-sister, Princess Lavinia of Yugoslavia (b 1961), was born before her parents' marriage 108 Christopher Habsburg (b 1957) and his children, his siblings, their descendants and his paternal uncles, aunts, and their descendants are not shown in most order of succession lists because his grandmother Princess Ileana of Romania's marriage to a Roman Catholic. Christoph's father, the late Archduke Stefan of Austria, Prince of Tuscany, became an American citizen and he and his family use the surname Habsburg. 143 Karl-Emich, 8th F\u00fcrst zu Leiningen (b 1952) is not shown in most lists because of his (second) marriage to a Roman Catholic. 159 Hereditary Prince Karl Friedrich of Hohenzollern (b 1952), his children and his siblings, are excluded from most lists because his mother, Princess Margarita of Leiningen, married a Roman Catholic. 183 Prince Christian-Sigismund of Prussia (b 1946). His elder daughter, Isabelle Grandmontagne-Prinzessin von Preussen (b 1969), is not shown because he was unmarried when she was born. 216 Alfonso de Orl\u00e9ans-Borb\u00f3n y Ferrara-Pignatelli, 7th Duke of Galliera (b 1968). Alfonso (including his child, his sibling, his paternal uncle and aunts and their descendants) is not shown because his ancestor, Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, married a Roman Catholic. 238 Princess Birgitta of Sweden (b 1937) and her descendants are excluded because of her marriage to a Roman Catholic. 257 Count Carl Johan Bernadotte af Wisborg (b 1916) is listed but his children, Monika Bernadotte (b 1948) and Christian Bernadotte (b 1949), are not shown because they are adopted 294 Falk, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (b 1990) is not recog nized as a member of the formerly sovereign family of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Falk's father, Peter Schmitt, legally changed his surname (to Prinz von Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha) at his marriage. According to German law on surnames, men and women are permitted to change their names to that of their spouse, but such a name change does not confer royal status. 297 Prince Peter of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (b 1964). Prince Peter's son, Prince Malte of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (b 1990), was born before his parents' marriage. 322 Countess Anne-Charlotte of Castell-R\u00fcdenhausen (b 1962) is listed but her eldest son, Henrik zu Castell-R\u00fcdenhausen (b 1982), is not shown because she was unmarried at his birth. 331 Beatrice Huntington-Whiteley (b 1962) is married to a Roman Catholic. 333 Calma Schnirring (b 1938).

      "body": "<p>For my parents and my teachers, it was - and they meant it unironically - \"something to look up to\". I invite readers who are of my generation to remember that familiar, modest, slightly embarrassing mantra, if only as a measure of how old they are. Something up to which to look would be more grammatical, of course, but no less archaic. Nowadays, the royal family is at best something to look at, and at worst something to look away from, or look down upon.</p> <p>It unavoidably remains, however, something to contemplate. The gaze cannot be averted for long. The Windsor clan still compels attention even from the reluctant or the sated. It does so either by pervading the showbiz media, or by occupying the no man's land that separates us from the constitutional future. Whichever direction we may be taking, there is a monarchy-shaped blur that obscures the view. More worrying in a way, there seems to be a fear of what might be revealed if that blur was dispelled.</p> <p>Events, many of them biological, have done what republican propaganda could not and forced at least a surmise about what lies on the other side of the fog. It will come as sad news to some people, but within a few years the Queen Mother will be no more, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will be on their last legs, and the mass-circulation papers will be forced to write in earnest about the really serious matters, such as whether or not \"It's Queen Camilla!\", or with which \"supermodel\" Prince William will compromise himself.</p> <p>And all of this tripe, at which the heart sinks in anticipation, will occur in a parallel universe reported less luridly on other pages. (Sample headlines: \"Catholics outnumber Protestants in new Ulster census\"; \"Scotland says 'Aye' to self-government\"; \"Blur in Channel - EU isolated.\")</p> <p>At around that time, if I'm spared, I will no doubt be hearing from Windsor partisans who demand to know if I'd really prefer President Bush, or what it is I have against our tourist trade. Who knows: I may even meet a cheery old pearly king or queen who will spontaneously exclaim: \"I wouldn't have her job, mate. Not for a million smackers!\" (Oh do shut up. Nobody's going to offer you the job - you weren't born into the right family for a start - and if they did, a million \"smackers\" wouldn't be the half of it.)</p> <p>But deference has become an irrelevant curio, and tourists will probably manage to get here anyway, and the American presidential system will (with any luck at all) be coming under increasingly strenuous criticism precisely for being too monarchical and ceremonial. We shall still be faced with the question of how to make a devolved and Europeanised parliamentary system out of the sow's ear of \"the crown in parliament\" and the ramshackle insular union for which it stood.</p> <p>Understand that there is no avoiding this; we can do many things but we cannot go on as we have. And there may be a variety of potential solutions, but King Charles III is not one of them, not even on an exceptionally good day.</p> <p>Walter Bagehot's famous distinction between the \"dignified\" and the \"efficient\" parts of our unwritten constitution is in reality a distinction without a difference. If efficiency can be assumed of the functioning parts, then dignity is at least probable in the decorative ones. But something that is by definition inefficient is fairly certain also to be undignified. And the House of Windsor has overdetermined this outcome by sacrificing what remained of its rather heavy dignity in a welter of family dysfunction.</p> <p>In addition to this, it almost imposes irrelevance. Recall the chancellorship of Norman Lamont; that amazing interlude in the history of our great currency. As the debate on the euro began to become real for the first time, he returned from a tense meeting with his fellow European finance ministers with the breathless intelligence that, whatever shape the future money was to take, he had ensured that the British version would still have the sovereign's head inscribed upon it. Imagine the effort that was involved in this Treasury triumph.</p> <p>And those who believe that monarchy acts as a solvent upon local differences have only to look at the recent symbolic tussles in the six counties, where the first step - the necessary if not the sufficient condition - towards a redefined and non-sectarian police force was the removal of the word \"royal\" from its name.</p> <p>This country for some reason does not have a name. Britain doesn't quite cover it (Ulster is part of the UK but not of Great Britain), England clearly doesn't cover it, and terms such as Albion or Britannia are part of the lost world of the Punch cartoon. Instead we have - like the recipient of some outmoded honour - a title: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Other countries have titles which express ideas - \"the United States of America\" was proudly coined by that great English republican Thomas Paine, and at a time when there were fewer than 20 states - but ours is more a mode of address for a slightly iffy constitutional compromise that is now drawing peacefully towards its close.</p> <p>And at the apex of this compromise is, fittingly enough, an absurdity. If it were not for the regal fog - the mist of state openings and birthday honours and Christmas broadcasts and fairytale weddings - we could have begun to confront this reality long before it was thrust upon us.</p> <p>The argument of practicality - of the obvious need to evolve a secular constitution that separates church from state, replaces the hereditary principle and in other ways reflects the modern Euro-American world of human rights and civil society - ought not to be allowed to obscure the argument of principle. At bottom, the republican idea contains a different concept of citizenship itself. Not only does monarchy have a bad effect on our elite, it has a dire effect on our popular and public opinion.</p> <p>Historically, the favouritism shown by Buckingham Palace to certain politicians and generals - to Benjamin Disraeli and Field Marshal Douglas Haig and Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain and Sir Alec Douglas-Home - has been meddlesome and retrograde. And many mediocre political time-servers have become completely insufferable with the addition of the words \"right honourable\" and the initials \"PC\" (for \"privy counsellor\" of all things) to their names. I think we may doubt that it was entirely good for Tony Blair to become so much of a palace politician so early in his tenure; it's only a step from nominating the \"people's princess\" to developing the fatal illusion that you can cure scrofula by being the princely people's prime minister.</p> <p>Further down the scale, though, the monarchic principle constitutes an obstacle to precisely that sense of responsibility about which we hear so much. It can't be good for people to lead vicarious lives, made up partly of prurience and partly of deference, and fixated on the doings of an undistinguished and spoiled family.</p> <p>In case I should seem snobbish about this, I can speak of the section of the public with which I am best acquainted: the humble drudges who bring out the nation's newspapers. The \"royal\" theme operates with the intensity of Gresham's law in this sector, encouraging laziness and sentimentality and salacity by making it too easy to fill page upon page with brainless twaddle, and encouraging contempt for the readership that makes itself such an easy target.</p> <p>There have been times in our history - the stupid adulation of the loath some Edward VIII as \"one of us\" - when such manipulated populism was positively dangerous. But at no time is this conditioning of mild hysteria and personality cult a wholesome thing.</p> <p>What one wants to propose, therefore, is not that we abolish monarchy but that we transcend it or, to put it in more old-fashioned terms, that we grow out of it. To remove the Windsors by the stroke of a legislative pen would be highly satisfying in one way, but disappointing in another. The infantilism and cretinism of the press, for example, can't be cured just by a fiat. What should now begin is the process of emancipating ourselves from the mental habits of royalism, and the many supports it provides to unthinking attitudes and dysfunctional practices.</p> <p>The last-ditchers are right in one way: it would scarcely be progress if we scrapped the Windsors and then prostrated ourselves at the feet of an imperial presidency. But if the argument is rightly conducted then the attitudes required to see us through to a democratic republic - or federation of democratic republics - would be their own insurance. We even begin to think as democratic republicans, and culti vate and reward democratic republican virtues.</p> <p>Those who really wanted to would not be prevented from idolising Prince William or from gurgling at the Queen Mum.

      "bodyText": "For my parents and my teachers, it was - and they meant it unironically - \"something to look up to\". I invite readers who are of my generation to remember that familiar, modest, slightly embarrassing mantra, if only as a measure of how old they are. Something up to which to look would be more grammatical, of course, but no less archaic. Nowadays, the royal family is at best something to look at, and at worst something to look away from, or look down upon. It unavoidably remains, however, something to contemplate. The gaze cannot be averted for long. The Windsor clan still compels attention even from the reluctant or the sated. It does so either by pervading the showbiz media, or by occupying the no man's land that separates us from the constitutional future. Whichever direction we may be taking, there is a monarchy-shaped blur that obscures the view. More worrying in a way, there seems to be a fear of what might be revealed if that blur was dispelled. Events, many of them biological, have done what republican propaganda could not and forced at least a surmise about what lies on the other side of the fog. It will come as sad news to some people, but within a few years the Queen Mother will be no more, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will be on their last legs, and the mass-circulation papers will be forced to write in earnest about the really serious matters, such as whether or not \"It's Queen Camilla!\", or with which \"supermodel\" Prince William will compromise himself. And all of this tripe, at which the heart sinks in anticipation, will occur in a parallel universe reported less luridly on other pages. (Sample headlines: \"Catholics outnumber Protestants in new Ulster census\"; \"Scotland says 'Aye' to self-government\"; \"Blur in Channel - EU isolated.\") At around that time, if I'm spared, I will no doubt be hearing from Windsor partisans who demand to know if I'd really prefer President Bush, or what it is I have against our tourist trade. Who knows: I may even meet a cheery old pearly king or queen who will spontaneously exclaim: \"I wouldn't have her job, mate. Not for a million smackers!\" (Oh do shut up. Nobody's going to offer you the job - you weren't born into the right family for a start - and if they did, a million \"smackers\" wouldn't be the half of it.) But deference has become an irrelevant curio, and tourists will probably manage to get here anyway, and the American presidential system will (with any luck at all) be coming under increasingly strenuous criticism precisely for being too monarchical and ceremonial. We shall still be faced with the question of how to make a devolved and Europeanised parliamentary system out of the sow's ear of \"the crown in parliament\" and the ramshackle insular union for which it stood. Understand that there is no avoiding this; we can do many things but we cannot go on as we have. And there may be a variety of potential solutions, but King Charles III is not one of them, not even on an exceptionally good day. Walter Bagehot's famous distinction between the \"dignified\" and the \"efficient\" parts of our unwritten constitution is in reality a distinction without a difference. If efficiency can be assumed of the functioning parts, then dignity is at least probable in the decorative ones. But something that is by definition inefficient is fairly certain also to be undignified. And the House of Windsor has overdetermined this outcome by sacrificing what remained of its rather heavy dignity in a welter of family dysfunction. In addition to this, it almost imposes irrelevance. Recall the chancellorship of Norman Lamont; that amazing interlude in the history of our great currency. As the debate on the euro began to become real for the first time, he returned from a tense meeting with his fellow European finance ministers with the breathless intelligence that, whatever shape the future money was to take, he had ensured that the British version would still have the sovereign's head inscribed upon it. Imagine the effort that was involved in this Treasury triumph. And those who believe that monarchy acts as a solvent upon local differences have only to look at the recent symbolic tussles in the six counties, where the first step - the necessary if not the sufficient condition - towards a redefined and non-sectarian police force was the removal of the word \"royal\" from its name. This country for some reason does not have a name. Britain doesn't quite cover it (Ulster is part of the UK but not of Great Britain), England clearly doesn't cover it, and terms such as Albion or Britannia are part of the lost world of the Punch cartoon. Instead we have - like the recipient of some outmoded honour - a title: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Other countries have titles which express ideas - \"the United States of America\" was proudly coined by that great English republican Thomas Paine, and at a time when there were fewer than 20 states - but ours is more a mode of address for a slightly iffy constitutional compromise that is now drawing peacefully towards its close. And at the apex of this compromise is, fittingly enough, an absurdity. If it were not for the regal fog - the mist of state openings and birthday honours and Christmas broadcasts and fairytale weddings - we could have begun to confront this reality long before it was thrust upon us. The argument of practicality - of the obvious need to evolve a secular constitution that separates church from state, replaces the hereditary principle and in other ways reflects the modern Euro-American world of human rights and civil society - ought not to be allowed to obscure the argument of principle. At bottom, the republican idea contains a different concept of citizenship itself. Not only does monarchy have a bad effect on our elite, it has a dire effect on our popular and public opinion. Historically, the favouritism shown by Buckingham Palace to certain politicians and generals - to Benjamin Disraeli and Field Marshal Douglas Haig and Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain and Sir Alec Douglas-Home - has been meddlesome and retrograde. And many mediocre political time-servers have become completely insufferable with the addition of the words \"right honourable\" and the initials \"PC\" (for \"privy counsellor\" of all things) to their names. I think we may doubt that it was entirely good for Tony Blair to become so much of a palace politician so early in his tenure; it's only a step from nominating the \"people's princess\" to developing the fatal illusion that you can cure scrofula by being the princely people's prime minister. Further down the scale, though, the monarchic principle constitutes an obstacle to precisely that sense of responsibility about which we hear so much. It can't be good for people to lead vicarious lives, made up partly of prurience and partly of deference, and fixated on the doings of an undistinguished and spoiled family. In case I should seem snobbish about this, I can speak of the section of the public with which I am best acquainted: the humble drudges who bring out the nation's newspapers. The \"royal\" theme operates with the intensity of Gresham's law in this sector, encouraging laziness and sentimentality and salacity by making it too easy to fill page upon page with brainless twaddle, and encouraging contempt for the readership that makes itself such an easy target. There have been times in our history - the stupid adulation of the loath some Edward VIII as \"one of us\" - when such manipulated populism was positively dangerous. But at no time is this conditioning of mild hysteria and personality cult a wholesome thing. What one wants to propose, therefore, is not that we abolish monarchy but that we transcend it or, to put it in more old-fashioned terms, that we grow out of it. To remove the Windsors by the stroke of a legislative pen would be highly satisfying in one way, but disappointing in another. The infantilism and cretinism of the press, for example, can't be cured just by a fiat. What should now begin is the process of emancipating ourselves from the mental habits of royalism, and the many supports it provides to unthinking attitudes and dysfunctional practices. The last-ditchers are right in one way: it would scarcely be progress if we scrapped the Windsors and then prostrated ourselves at the feet of an imperial presidency. But if the argument is rightly conducted then the attitudes required to see us through to a democratic republic - or federation of democratic republics - would be their own insurance. We even begin to think as democratic republicans, and culti vate and reward democratic republican virtues. Those who really wanted to would not be prevented from idolising Prince William or from gurgling at the Queen Mum. There will be room for royalists and restorationists in a democratic republic, and there will no doubt be tabloids and glossies to gratify them. But the large and growing number of republicans and democrats will not have to witness this spectacle as if we were all a part of it, and it was all a part of us. The private travails of the Windsors would not have - as they now do - the gruesome aspect of a publicly financed human sacrifice. The converse, in other words, does not hold - there is not limitless room for democracy in a monarchy and the sooner we appreciate this, and demand the extra space that an adult and constitutional settlement would require, the better off all of us, including even the monarchists, will be. \u0095 Christopher Hitchens is a columnist for Vanity Fair.

      "body": "<p>It is the question republicans have learned to fear. \"All right then,\" says the smiling royalist, \"let's say you go ahead and abolish the monarchy. What would you put in its place?\"</p> <p>Variations of that question have proved lethal for reformers. In Britain the republican cause has been held back for years by two words: President Thatcher. Or, put another way, President Hattersley. Tune in to any of the now regular phone-ins and TV debates on the monarchy and you'll soon hear a defender of the status quo winning over his audience by conjuring up a dread prospect of the future.</p> <p>In Australia that trap proved fatal for the republican movement. Polls showed that more than 70% of Australians wanted to elect their own head of state. Yet the 1999 referendum proposing to remove the Queen as Oz's national figurehead failed because voters did not like the replacement on offer, a \"politicians' president\" chosen by the Canberra parliament.</p> <p>That result left British reformers with a challenge, forcing them to realise that it was not enough simply to rail against the present order: they would have to explain how any future change would work.</p> <p>The first move, as made clear both by David McKie and in today's editorial, is to address the crown prerogative. Many lawyers, scholars and activists now agree that \"the crown\" underpins and explains many if not most of the excesses and distortions of our current governmental set-up. But what would reform of such a nebulous, shadowy concept entail? What would abolition of the crown mean?</p> <p>At first glance, such a drastic move might seem just too vast - like whipping out the ground from underneath our feet. Everything would have to change - from our land law, which technically makes every freeholder the mere owner of an interest in the land of the monarch, to our courts, which currently present every case as The Crown or Regina vs. Joe Bloggs.</p> <p>In fact, it would not be that complicated. Legally, the notional entity of the crown could simply be replaced by \"the state\" or, where it's more honest, \"the government\" or even, perhaps in criminal court cases, by \"the people.\" Each one of these would be abstract entities, admittedly, but they would at least be less opaque than the legal fiction that is \"the crown\". As Geoffrey Robertson QC explains it, the crown is merely \"an artefact\". To replace it with the people and their parliament is a simple manoeuvre.</p> <p>The more fundamental matter is the crown as a constitutional, rather than legal, entity: what would we do with the prerogative?</p> <p>This is actually two questions rolled into one. First, there are the residual royal powers, which can be exercised by the monarch herself: to appoint a prime minister and refuse a request for a dissolution of parliament. These look merely theoretical, until one imagines Britain caught in a Florida-style electoral deadlock. In the event of a hung parliament, who under our current system would choose whether to give the nod to Tony Blair or William Hague? Answer: the Queen.</p> <p>The fate for these two royal prerogatives is fairly straightforward. We could simply keep them in the hands of the newly democratic head of state - however that person was chosen (of which more later). Or we could make at least one of those powers redundant. The right to refuse a dissolution exists only because our parliamentary terms are currently not fixed. With set terms, of four or five years, there would be no question of early elections. Polling day would be known years in advance - with no need to give the power over dissolution to anyone. Such a reform would have the added benefit of bringing fairness to our electoral contests: at present, the prime minister's right to name polling day is tantamount to a running race in which one of the contestants gets to fire the starting gun.</p> <p><b> Crown prerogative</b><br></p> <p>More complex is the crown prerogative itself. As David McKie writes on page 19, that notion is used to exercise all kinds of executive power - from making war to dispensing largesse and patronage. What would we do with these powers, currently exercised not by the Queen but by the prime minister?</p> <p>The answer is abolition. The flaw of the last constitutional settlement - in the 17th century - was that it did not abolish the absolute powers of the monarch, but merely tied them up in purple string and handed them, in effect, to the prime minister. The absolute powers themselves remained; only the person wielding them changed. So the solution now would not be to keep crown prerogative in the hands of the PM, with only a change of name. On the contrary, the reformers' case is that the prerogative itself should be taken apart.</p> <p>What that would mean in practice is diffusion. Some of today's crown powers would stay in the hands of the executive but others would be spread about. The power to make war and sign treaties might go to the UK parliament in Westminster. The power of patronage, to fill the benches of the second chamber, could move to the electorate, via direct election of new members. The vast battery of powers that makes our executive the mightiest in the western world could all be spread elsewhere: more to the parliaments in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff, more to mayors in London and to any other big city that wants them. The crown prerogative would simply be dismantled - its goodies spread around the country, no longer hoarded at the centre. The result would be a change in the very way Britain is governed. No longer the old monarchical model, in which power flows from the top down - but a more democratic shape, in which power is diffuse and flows from the bottom up.</p> <p>So much for the royal and crown prerogatives. With those powers either aboliished or transferred, what's left in the space marked head of state? Is there even a job left to fill?</p> <p>The palace doubt it. They believe that the vague, mysterious association of Crown and Queen is essential to her role as head of state. They insist that no head of state could ever function separate from the ancient edifice of prerogative. In other words, Britain could not conceivably have a head of state other than a monarch.</p> <p>But look closer. Here is how palace officials privately define the job. To them, a head of state must act as the focus of the nation, leading the nation in mourning or celebration - serving as the public expression of collective emotions. Cattily, some might doubt the royals' track record in this particular field. More seriously, they might wonder if this is a task only those of royal blood could perform.</p> <p>Second, say the Windsor circle, a head of state should recognise public achievement: visiting hospitals, handing out awards. True but, once again, is this a role that could only be performed by a single, genetically ordained family? Third, a national figurehead should contribute to the collective welfare - leading voluntary work or promoting charity. There's no doubt today's royals do that - but so do elected heads of state the world over.</p> <p>In fact, it is only the last aspect of the palace's job description that touches on a role perhaps the royals alone can perform: to act as a rock of continuity, an anchor during periods of intense change. It's true that royalty can claim a lineage and a past that others cannot. But even that is a mixed blessing: for the rock symbolises not just stability but paralysis, a society whose hierarchies and aristocracy remain in place for centuries - permanently excluding everyone else from ever reaching the nation's symbolic pinnacle.</p> <p><b> The people's choice</b><br></p> <p>So, despite the palace's insistence to the contrary, a head of state does not always have to be chosen by birth. They can be chosen by people. How might Britain do it? Most republicans agree the question will not realistically, and probably ought not, arise until the present Queen dies. She has won wide admiration after a half-century of service and will doubtless close out her reign the same way. But what then? There are countless options. Perhaps the simplest would be to combine the role of head of state with that of head of government, so that when the nation chooses a prime minister at election time it would also pick the person to host foreign dignitaries and state banquets. That would be simple, but perhaps unsatisfactory - for we would lose out on the extra role of constitutional longstop a head of state can play.</p> <p>We could opt for direct election, just like the Irish. Enter the critics threatening the nightmare of Presidents Hattersley or Thatcher - though if that truly is a nightmare, the electorate is hardly likely to vote for it. Besides, one could easily write the rules to prevent any past politician seeking the job. When one looks at the success of Mary Robinson or Mary McAleese in Dublin, direct election looks quite appealing.</p> <p>For those who suspect a directly-elected president with a national mandate would be too strong a rival for the rest of our politicians - chiefly the prime minister - to tolerate, then indirect election is the obvious alternative. At present MPs, who we vote for, choose the Speaker - and that person could easily double as head of state, even taking on the weighty task of picking which leader should form a government from a hung parliament. Some would say that would give the Speaker too much power, especially if Britain were to adopt proportional representation. But that power already exists -resting in the hands of a hereditary monarch nobody chooses and nobody can remove.</p> <p>There are plenty of variations: including activist Anthony Barnett's notion that a \"royal family\" should be chosen by random lot, like jury service, once every three years. Reformers argue that Britons can do it however they like - just so long as, for the first time ever, they choose their own head of state.</p> <p>The benefits, they say, will be subtle, but real. For Britons will do more than choose the person who \"interprets the nation to itself\". By asserting themselves, rather than the crown, as the governing force in British life, they will become the owners of their own country - insisting that it is their land, not the crown's, that it is their government, not Her Majesty's, and that nothing is beyond their reach. Britons will be owners, not tenants, of their country; citizens, not subjects. We will at last be able to declare that there is only one sovereign in our land - and it is ourselves.</p> <p><b>20 things only a monarch can do</b></p> <p><b> 1</b>Own all unmarked mute swans on open water.</p> <p><b> 2</b> Hold up other traffic on the railways while the royal train passes.</p> <p><b> 3</b> Get the full and unabridged minutes of all Cabinet minutes - unlike Cabinet ministers who must make do with a summary.</p> <p><b> 4</b> Receive reports of all Royal commissions ahead of those who commissioned them, on vellum.</p> <p><b> 5</b> Declare holidays: an extra bank holiday in 2002 to mark the golden jubilee four- day celebration weekend.</p> <p><b> 6</b> Appoint all magistrates in Liverpool, Manchester and Lancashire. The Queen is known as Duke of Lancashire when in the Duchy of Lancaster.</p> <p><b> 7</b> Require the national flag to be flown on 16 royal birthdays anniversaries, from 8am until sunset.</p> <p><b> 8</b> Appoint a privy council.

      "bodyText": "It is the question republicans have learned to fear. \"All right then,\" says the smiling royalist, \"let's say you go ahead and abolish the monarchy. What would you put in its place?\" Variations of that question have proved lethal for reformers. In Britain the republican cause has been held back for years by two words: President Thatcher. Or, put another way, President Hattersley. Tune in to any of the now regular phone-ins and TV debates on the monarchy and you'll soon hear a defender of the status quo winning over his audience by conjuring up a dread prospect of the future. In Australia that trap proved fatal for the republican movement. Polls showed that more than 70% of Australians wanted to elect their own head of state. Yet the 1999 referendum proposing to remove the Queen as Oz's national figurehead failed because voters did not like the replacement on offer, a \"politicians' president\" chosen by the Canberra parliament. That result left British reformers with a challenge, forcing them to realise that it was not enough simply to rail against the present order: they would have to explain how any future change would work. The first move, as made clear both by David McKie and in today's editorial, is to address the crown prerogative. Many lawyers, scholars and activists now agree that \"the crown\" underpins and explains many if not most of the excesses and distortions of our current governmental set-up. But what would reform of such a nebulous, shadowy concept entail? What would abolition of the crown mean? At first glance, such a drastic move might seem just too vast - like whipping out the ground from underneath our feet. Everything would have to change - from our land law, which technically makes every freeholder the mere owner of an interest in the land of the monarch, to our courts, which currently present every case as The Crown or Regina vs. Joe Bloggs. In fact, it would not be that complicated. Legally, the notional entity of the crown could simply be replaced by \"the state\" or, where it's more honest, \"the government\" or even, perhaps in criminal court cases, by \"the people.\" Each one of these would be abstract entities, admittedly, but they would at least be less opaque than the legal fiction that is \"the crown\". As Geoffrey Robertson QC explains it, the crown is merely \"an artefact\". To replace it with the people and their parliament is a simple manoeuvre. The more fundamental matter is the crown as a constitutional, rather than legal, entity: what would we do with the prerogative? This is actually two questions rolled into one. First, there are the residual royal powers, which can be exercised by the monarch herself: to appoint a prime minister and refuse a request for a dissolution of parliament. These look merely theoretical, until one imagines Britain caught in a Florida-style electoral deadlock. In the event of a hung parliament, who under our current system would choose whether to give the nod to Tony Blair or William Hague? Answer: the Queen. The fate for these two royal prerogatives is fairly straightforward. We could simply keep them in the hands of the newly democratic head of state - however that person was chosen (of which more later). Or we could make at least one of those powers redundant. The right to refuse a dissolution exists only because our parliamentary terms are currently not fixed. With set terms, of four or five years, there would be no question of early elections. Polling day would be known years in advance - with no need to give the power over dissolution to anyone. Such a reform would have the added benefit of bringing fairness to our electoral contests: at present, the prime minister's right to name polling day is tantamount to a running race in which one of the contestants gets to fire the starting gun. Crown prerogative More complex is the crown prerogative itself. As David McKie writes on page 19, that notion is used to exercise all kinds of executive power - from making war to dispensing largesse and patronage. What would we do with these powers, currently exercised not by the Queen but by the prime minister? The answer is abolition. The flaw of the last constitutional settlement - in the 17th century - was that it did not abolish the absolute powers of the monarch, but merely tied them up in purple string and handed them, in effect, to the prime minister. The absolute powers themselves remained; only the person wielding them changed. So the solution now would not be to keep crown prerogative in the hands of the PM, with only a change of name. On the contrary, the reformers' case is that the prerogative itself should be taken apart. What that would mean in practice is diffusion. Some of today's crown powers would stay in the hands of the executive but others would be spread about. The power to make war and sign treaties might go to the UK parliament in Westminster. The power of patronage, to fill the benches of the second chamber, could move to the electorate, via direct election of new members. The vast battery of powers that makes our executive the mightiest in the western world could all be spread elsewhere: more to the parliaments in Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff, more to mayors in London and to any other big city that wants them. The crown prerogative would simply be dismantled - its goodies spread around the country, no longer hoarded at the centre. The result would be a change in the very way Britain is governed. No longer the old monarchical model, in which power flows from the top down - but a more democratic shape, in which power is diffuse and flows from the bottom up. So much for the royal and crown prerogatives. With those powers either aboliished or transferred, what's left in the space marked head of state? Is there even a job left to fill? The palace doubt it. They believe that the vague, mysterious association of Crown and Queen is essential to her role as head of state. They insist that no head of state could ever function separate from the ancient edifice of prerogative. In other words, Britain could not conceivably have a head of state other than a monarch. But look closer. Here is how palace officials privately define the job. To them, a head of state must act as the focus of the nation, leading the nation in mourning or celebration - serving as the public expression of collective emotions. Cattily, some might doubt the royals' track record in this particular field. More seriously, they might wonder if this is a task only those of royal blood could perform. Second, say the Windsor circle, a head of state should recognise public achievement: visiting hospitals, handing out awards. True but, once again, is this a role that could only be performed by a single, genetically ordained family? Third, a national figurehead should contribute to the collective welfare - leading voluntary work or promoting charity. There's no doubt today's royals do that - but so do elected heads of state the world over. In fact, it is only the last aspect of the palace's job description that touches on a role perhaps the royals alone can perform: to act as a rock of continuity, an anchor during periods of intense change. It's true that royalty can claim a lineage and a past that others cannot. But even that is a mixed blessing: for the rock symbolises not just stability but paralysis, a society whose hierarchies and aristocracy remain in place for centuries - permanently excluding everyone else from ever reaching the nation's symbolic pinnacle. The people's choice So, despite the palace's insistence to the contrary, a head of state does not always have to be chosen by birth. They can be chosen by people. How might Britain do it? Most republicans agree the question will not realistically, and probably ought not, arise until the present Queen dies. She has won wide admiration after a half-century of service and will doubtless close out her reign the same way. But what then? There are countless options. Perhaps the simplest would be to combine the role of head of state with that of head of government, so that when the nation chooses a prime minister at election time it would also pick the person to host foreign dignitaries and state banquets. That would be simple, but perhaps unsatisfactory - for we would lose out on the extra role of constitutional longstop a head of state can play. We could opt for direct election, just like the Irish. Enter the critics threatening the nightmare of Presidents Hattersley or Thatcher - though if that truly is a nightmare, the electorate is hardly likely to vote for it. Besides, one could easily write the rules to prevent any past politician seeking the job. When one looks at the success of Mary Robinson or Mary McAleese in Dublin, direct election looks quite appealing. For those who suspect a directly-elected president with a national mandate would be too strong a rival for the rest of our politicians - chiefly the prime minister - to tolerate, then indirect election is the obvious alternative. At present MPs, who we vote for, choose the Speaker - and that person could easily double as head of state, even taking on the weighty task of picking which leader should form a government from a hung parliament. Some would say that would give the Speaker too much power, especially if Britain were to adopt proportional representation. But that power already exists -resting in the hands of a hereditary monarch nobody chooses and nobody can remove. There are plenty of variations: including activist Anthony Barnett's notion that a \"royal family\" should be chosen by random lot, like jury service, once every three years. Reformers argue that Britons can do it however they like - just so long as, for the first time ever, they choose their own head of state. The benefits, they say, will be subtle, but real. For Britons will do more than choose the person who \"interprets the nation to itself\". By asserting themselves, rather than the crown, as the governing force in British life, they will become the owners of their own country - insisting that it is their land, not the crown's, that it is their government, not Her Majesty's, and that nothing is beyond their reach. Britons will be owners, not tenants, of their country; citizens, not subjects. We will at last be able to declare that there is only one sovereign in our land - and it is ourselves. 20 things only a monarch can do 1Own all unmarked mute swans on open water. 2 Hold up other traffic on the railways while the royal train passes. 3 Get the full and unabridged minutes of all Cabinet minutes - unlike Cabinet ministers who must make do with a summary. 4 Receive reports of all Royal commissions ahead of those who commissioned them, on vellum. 5 Declare holidays: an extra bank holiday in 2002 to mark the golden jubilee four- day celebration weekend. 6 Appoint all magistrates in Liverpool, Manchester and Lancashire. The Queen is known as Duke of Lancashire when in the Duchy of Lancaster. 7 Require the national flag to be flown on 16 royal birthdays anniversaries, from 8am until sunset. 8 Appoint a privy council. All senior politicians become members, undergoing a ceremony in which they kneel on a bible, take the royal hand and walk backwards out of the room. The privy council meets where the monarch happens to be (Balmoral, during the fuel crisis). 9 Get advice from QCs, free of charge. 10 Accept more orders and decorations than anyone else: the present Queen has 85 decorations from 68 countries. 11 Extend patronage: the present Queen is patron of 600 societies, organisations and events (816 over the reign). 12 Command regiments: every regiment of the British army owes its loyalty to a member of the royal family. The present Queen commands 46. 13 Receive a daily report of parliamentary proceedings from the vice chamberlain of the household: the report must reach the palace by dinner and is ready by no one else. The vice chamberlain, an MP, is held hostage during the state opening of parliament to ensure the monarch's safe return. 14 Issue special ivory carriage passes to members of the royal household and chosen ministers, allowing them to take a short cut through St James park. 15 Hold position of lord high admiral of the navy, which the present queen has held since 1964. (The Duke of Edinburgh is also admiral of the fleet in three navies: other admirals of the British navy are the King of Sweden and Don Juan of Borbon and Battenberg, the count of Barcelona). 16 Command oaths of loyalty: sworn by all MPs, lords, three of the four armed services, the judiciary, ordained priests of the Church of England, newly naturalised citizens. 17 Drive without a driving licence, because not covered by the Road Traffic Act. 18 Take as treasure trove all coin, bullion, gold and silver found buried for which no owners can be traced. 19 Award royal warrants to around 800 businesses, including seven champagne houses. 20 Avoid the criminal law: the monarch is not subject to it or to everyday regulations governing things like how long royal staff work.

      "body": "<p>The Guardian is to back a legal challenge to the 300-year-old law banning Roman Catholics and other non-Protestants from succession to the British throne, on the grounds that it clashes with the Human Rights Act and should be reinterpreted or removed from the statute book.</p> <p>Leading human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC believes the Act of Settlement 1701 may be affected by the European convention on human rights, which became part of UK law two months ago when the Human Rights Act came into force.</p> <p>The challenge to the Act of Settlement coincides with an editorial in the paper which argues for a referendum on the future of the monarchy.</p> <p>The act, passed at a time of widespread fear of Catholics, lays down that only Protestant heirs of Princess Sophia, granddaughter of James I, may take the British throne. Neither Catholics, nor those who marry a Catholic, nor those born out of wedlock, may remain in the line of succession.</p> <p>The act remains the crucial cornerstone of the British constitution, exercising an extraordinary hold over the monarchy and imposing limitations designed to tackle the imperatives of a political crisis at the dawn of the 18th century. But it is scarcely relevant to the 21st.</p> <p>Because of it, dozens of people have been barred from taking their place in the order of succession. Since many of them are German, the Guardian has placed an advertisement in the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung asking them to join the action to reclaim their birthright.</p> <p>Sons also take precedence over daughters and the right of succession belongs to the eldest son. The act institutionalises religious discrimination and male primogeniture.</p> <p>The Human Rights Act gives UK judges power for the first time to reinterpret statutes to make them compatible \"so far as possible\" with the European convention.</p> <p>Mr Robertson considers it may be \"possible\" for the courts to read the Act of Settlement's language in a way which avoids discrimination against women and some religious faiths but the \"express virulence\" of the act's anti-Catholic language could only be removed by legislation. If judges find it impossible to re-word the statute, the Human Rights Act allows them to make a \"declaration of incompatibility\". This leaves the statute in force but puts pressure on the government to reform it, since the UK has signed up to the convention and pledged that it will comply with convention rights.</p> <p>The Guardian argues in an editorial today that in the new millennium Britain should be given the choice whether to keep the royal family or to become a republic.</p> <p>Today and over the next few days the paper is running a number of articles advocating republicanism, despite another outdated statute, the Treason Felony Act 1848, which threatens anyone doing so with deportation \"for the term of his or her natural life\".</p> <p>The paper's editor, Alan Rusbridger wrote last week to the attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, asking for an assurance that he will not be prosecuted, given that he has no intention of advocating overthrow of the monarchy by force. In his letter, he argued the Treason Felony Act breaches article 10 of the European convention, the right to freedom of expression.</p> <p>He suggested the attorney general might ask the high court to reinterpret the Treason Felony Act so that only calls to overthrow the monarchy by violence would be an offence. He offered the paper's support in the application.</p> <p>Lord Williams replied: \"I hope you understand that Neither David Calvert-Smith [the director of public prosecutions] nor I can give you an assurance regarding whether or not a prosecution or other action will be taken. You are asking me to take action which sanctions in advance conduct which may be criminal. You should take your own legal advice then decide for yourself whether you will follow it.\"</p> <p>Under the Human Rights Act, judges are expected to interpret an existing statute as far as possible so as to be compatible with the human rights convention. Mr Robertson believes the courts may use this power to limit the scope of the Treason Felony Act so it complies with the right to freedom of expression. Only if this is not possible should they make a declaration of incompatibility.</p> <p>The Guardian believes the Act of Settlement violates article 9 of the convention, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. In addition, it breaches article 1 of protocol 1, the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions - in this case the banned descendants' place in the line of succession - and article 14, banning discrimination in relation to any convention right.</p> <p>Not only are Catholics banned from succession, but the sovereign must be in communion with the Church of England, must swear to preserve the church, and to uphold the Protestant line of succession. This appears to discriminate against other faiths, including Jews, Muslims and Hindus.</p> <p>At her coronation in 1953, the Queen pledged to maintain and preserve the church's doctrine, worship and discipline.</p> <p>In December 1999 the Scottish parliament backed unanimously a motion, spearheaded by the Scottish National party, to abolish the Act of Settlement. The debate had been initiated by Lord Hamilton - Tory whip in the Scottish parliament - who wrote to the Tony Blair asking him to lift the \"anachronistic\" act.</p> <p>Soon after the Scottish vote, the Archbishop of York, David Hope, called for the act to be amended to allow the heir to the throne to marry a Catholic.</p> <p>Officials said amending the act of Settlement .

      "bodyText": "The Guardian is to back a legal challenge to the 300-year-old law banning Roman Catholics and other non-Protestants from succession to the British throne, on the grounds that it clashes with the Human Rights Act and should be reinterpreted or removed from the statute book. Leading human rights lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC believes the Act of Settlement 1701 may be affected by the European convention on human rights, which became part of UK law two months ago when the Human Rights Act came into force. The challenge to the Act of Settlement coincides with an editorial in the paper which argues for a referendum on the future of the monarchy. The act, passed at a time of widespread fear of Catholics, lays down that only Protestant heirs of Princess Sophia, granddaughter of James I, may take the British throne. Neither Catholics, nor those who marry a Catholic, nor those born out of wedlock, may remain in the line of succession. The act remains the crucial cornerstone of the British constitution, exercising an extraordinary hold over the monarchy and imposing limitations designed to tackle the imperatives of a political crisis at the dawn of the 18th century. But it is scarcely relevant to the 21st. Because of it, dozens of people have been barred from taking their place in the order of succession. Since many of them are German, the Guardian has placed an advertisement in the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung asking them to join the action to reclaim their birthright. Sons also take precedence over daughters and the right of succession belongs to the eldest son. The act institutionalises religious discrimination and male primogeniture. The Human Rights Act gives UK judges power for the first time to reinterpret statutes to make them compatible \"so far as possible\" with the European convention. Mr Robertson considers it may be \"possible\" for the courts to read the Act of Settlement's language in a way which avoids discrimination against women and some religious faiths but the \"express virulence\" of the act's anti-Catholic language could only be removed by legislation. If judges find it impossible to re-word the statute, the Human Rights Act allows them to make a \"declaration of incompatibility\". This leaves the statute in force but puts pressure on the government to reform it, since the UK has signed up to the convention and pledged that it will comply with convention rights. The Guardian argues in an editorial today that in the new millennium Britain should be given the choice whether to keep the royal family or to become a republic. Today and over the next few days the paper is running a number of articles advocating republicanism, despite another outdated statute, the Treason Felony Act 1848, which threatens anyone doing so with deportation \"for the term of his or her natural life\". The paper's editor, Alan Rusbridger wrote last week to the attorney general, Lord Williams of Mostyn, asking for an assurance that he will not be prosecuted, given that he has no intention of advocating overthrow of the monarchy by force. In his letter, he argued the Treason Felony Act breaches article 10 of the European convention, the right to freedom of expression. He suggested the attorney general might ask the high court to reinterpret the Treason Felony Act so that only calls to overthrow the monarchy by violence would be an offence. He offered the paper's support in the application. Lord Williams replied: \"I hope you understand that Neither David Calvert-Smith [the director of public prosecutions] nor I can give you an assurance regarding whether or not a prosecution or other action will be taken. You are asking me to take action which sanctions in advance conduct which may be criminal. You should take your own legal advice then decide for yourself whether you will follow it.\" Under the Human Rights Act, judges are expected to interpret an existing statute as far as possible so as to be compatible with the human rights convention. Mr Robertson believes the courts may use this power to limit the scope of the Treason Felony Act so it complies with the right to freedom of expression. Only if this is not possible should they make a declaration of incompatibility. The Guardian believes the Act of Settlement violates article 9 of the convention, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. In addition, it breaches article 1 of protocol 1, the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions - in this case the banned descendants' place in the line of succession - and article 14, banning discrimination in relation to any convention right. Not only are Catholics banned from succession, but the sovereign must be in communion with the Church of England, must swear to preserve the church, and to uphold the Protestant line of succession. This appears to discriminate against other faiths, including Jews, Muslims and Hindus. At her coronation in 1953, the Queen pledged to maintain and preserve the church's doctrine, worship and discipline. In December 1999 the Scottish parliament backed unanimously a motion, spearheaded by the Scottish National party, to abolish the Act of Settlement. The debate had been initiated by Lord Hamilton - Tory whip in the Scottish parliament - who wrote to the Tony Blair asking him to lift the \"anachronistic\" act. Soon after the Scottish vote, the Archbishop of York, David Hope, called for the act to be amended to allow the heir to the throne to marry a Catholic. Officials said amending the act of Settlement . But the Human Rights Act lays down a fast track method for amending statutes judged incompatible with the European convention. Failure to do so would leave the UK open to condemnation by the European court. \"No one can really defend this act,\" said Mr Rusbridger. \"Since MPs are barred from openly debating the role of the monarch we thought a newspaper might set the ball rolling. We very much hope that the odd Hapsburg or Saxe-Coburg might join in.\" Related stories - news 6 December: Majority want to be citizens not subjects Related stories - comment 6 December leader: Magic or not, let in the daylight Jonathan Freedland: The people versus the crown Polly Toynbee: The need to modernise our country Christopher Hitchens: End of the line Vernon Bogdanor : The Guardian has got it wrong Related stories - background How ministers exercise arbitrary power Ten year deal fit for a Queen The Scottish threat Full text: the act of settlement, 1701 Cartoon: Steve Bell Talk about it Do we need a monarchy?

      "body": "<p>A Daily Telegraph journalist who jumped into a man's car and said \"Take me home, you black bastard\" has claimed he has no memory of what happened.</p> <p>Dominic Swords, 34, a subeditor with the national newspaper, stepped in front of Delbert Husband's car while he was driving on London's Tower Bridge. He then got into the car and started to shout foul, racist abuse at the shocked driver. </p> <p>Swords was in the car for more than 20 minutes, causing traffic on the busy London road to build up as Delbert refused to drive him home. The police were called and he was arrested and charged with common assault. </p> <p>But Swords refused to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty on his first appearance before Victoria Court Magistrate on October 13. He demanded to see CCTV evidence before finally pleading guilty to charges of threatening behaviour and racially motivated assault last month. </p> <p>In a letter to Delbert, Swords wrote: \"I have just seen the CCTV footage of what took place between us on Tower Bridge last month. Until now I had no memory of the incident. All I remember is leaving the party I had attended and thinking 'I'm drunk, I'd better get a cab home'. </p> <p>\"I am truly sorry for putting you through the ordeal of having to deal with a lunatic getting in your car and then shouting abuse at you. You obviously did the right thing in staying calm and calling the police. I am amazed and grateful that you did not throw me off the bridge.

      "bodyText": "A Daily Telegraph journalist who jumped into a man's car and said \"Take me home, you black bastard\" has claimed he has no memory of what happened. Dominic Swords, 34, a subeditor with the national newspaper, stepped in front of Delbert Husband's car while he was driving on London's Tower Bridge. He then got into the car and started to shout foul, racist abuse at the shocked driver. Swords was in the car for more than 20 minutes, causing traffic on the busy London road to build up as Delbert refused to drive him home. The police were called and he was arrested and charged with common assault. But Swords refused to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty on his first appearance before Victoria Court Magistrate on October 13. He demanded to see CCTV evidence before finally pleading guilty to charges of threatening behaviour and racially motivated assault last month. In a letter to Delbert, Swords wrote: \"I have just seen the CCTV footage of what took place between us on Tower Bridge last month. Until now I had no memory of the incident. All I remember is leaving the party I had attended and thinking 'I'm drunk, I'd better get a cab home'. \"I am truly sorry for putting you through the ordeal of having to deal with a lunatic getting in your car and then shouting abuse at you. You obviously did the right thing in staying calm and calling the police. I am amazed and grateful that you did not throw me off the bridge. What I did was utterly awful and if you had given me a thrashing I would have no grounds for complaint.\" But Delbert, speaking to New Nation exclusively after his ordeal, feels that the apology, which came one month after the incident, is too late. The 32-year-old maintenance worker for Lewisham Council told New Nation: \"This letter has come too late, I read it and thought he was just grovelling.

Three years after saying farewell to the nation, the queens of comedy Jennifer Saunders, Joanna Lumley, June Whitfield and Julia Sawalha are to be reunited in a brand new series of the hit BBC sitcom. Ms Saunders said today she decided to write a new series after she sat down with the cast for a special one-off comedy, Mirrorball, to be screened over Christmas. \"We had such a great time making Mirrorball that we all wanted to work together again. \"But when I sat down to write the new characters I felt Edina and Patsy and all the other Ab Fab characters vying for my attention,\" said Ms Saunders. She added: \"So, in the end I gave in...and I'm looking forward to moving on the characters into the millennium, and adding a few new ones.\" A new series of Ab Fab is a major coup for BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey who, like her predecessor Peter Salmon, has been ordered to inject some new life into sitcom and comedy drama. Ab Fab is guaranteed to win the heart of the nation however - it won ratings of over 11 million when originally screened. The new series will be a cross between Mirrorball and Absolutely Fabulous, with life in the Bollinger-saturated public relations world dramatically changed. PR disaster Edina, played by Ms Saunders, is now promoting herself as a media celebrity while her straight-laced daughter Saffie, played by Julia Sawalha, has become a \"serious\" actress. Saffie's grandmother - June Whitfield - has a new job while darling Patsy, played by Joanna Lumley, finds herself on her uppers, rummaging through bins while she tries to hold her own. Jane Horrocks, formerly Bubbles, will return as as Yitta Hilberstam, an Icelandic waitress whose command of English is eccentric.

      "bodyText": "As the BBC's millennium experiment Castaway comes to an end and the volunteers prepare to escape the ravaged island of Taransay, TV executives have already secretly filmed another spectacular live-in experiment. BBC1 is sending a team of volunteers back to the iron age in a bid to give viewers a sense of what it was like to live 2,000 years ago. Surviving the Iron Age revisits an experiment conducted by the BBC 23 years ago, when a group of young people cut themselves off from society and lived for a year like Iron Age Britons in a settlement near Shaftesbury, Dorset. The 12 adults and three children were denied the comforts of late 20th century life, had to kill their own animals, wash their hair in clay and brush their teeth with hazel twigs. Today the BBC revealed it had sent 17 volunteers, some of whom were the children of the original participants. Seven men, seven women and three children have braved the elements of West Wales for nearly seven weeks living in authentic Iron Age round houses, making soap from sheep fat and killing their own chickens and butchering their own cattle. The programme is one of the highlights of the winter season unveiled by the BBC today. It also announced it was investing almost \u00a360m in new drama for the winter schedule which will see 13 brand new titles over the next three months. One of the centrepieces is the controversial drama Rebel Heart, by writer Ronan Bennett, focusing on the passion and patriotism surrounding the 1916 rising in Ireland and the civil war that followed. Sue Townsend's latest Adrian Mole creation, The Cappuccino Years, will also take centre stage. Stephen Tomkinson and Nick Berry will be starring as undercover detectives in the gritty drama, In Deep. And Michelle Collins and comedian Paul Kaye star in Two Thousand Acres Of Sky, a humorous and poignant drama about a single mum desperate to escape inner city life. John Cleese, with the help of Elizabeth Hurley, sets out to discover the mysteries of life, in The Human Face, a documentary that traces the use and importance of the image of the face through the ages. Among the comedy highlights for the winter schedule are Lee Evans's first situation comedy, Lee Evans - So What Now. And Pauline Quirk will star in Office Gossip, her first sitcom since Birds Of A Feather. BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey said: \"The added investment in BBC1 is already visible on the screen. We have been able to offer the viewer 20% more drama than last winter.\"",

      "bodyText": "Dixons' internet firm, Freeserve, looks set to be taken over after its shares were suspended on the stock exchange. The UK's largest internet service provider is expected to be snapped up by French rival Wanadoo, which also had its stock suspended today from the Paris Bourse. Nearly a third of all UK users subscribe to Freeserve. The company, which is 80%-owned by high street retailer Dixons, has been the subject of continued bid rumours since the collapse in June of talks with Germany's T-Online. An announcement is expected later today. Dixons may rue the collapse of the T-Online deal as at the time Freeserve's shares were earmarked for sale at around 600p each; they are now likely to fetch only 175p. A successful deal would see Freeserve linking up with some illustrious media partners. Wanadoo's parent company is France Telecom, which owns mobile phone operator Orange and 22% of UK cable giant NTL. Today's developments could herald the first move in the long-awaited consolidation of the European internet service provider sector, which has been slow to take off owing to market turbulence. Analysts say European ISPs such as Freeserve and Wanadoo need to boost the scale of their operations to be able to compete with bigger rivals such as AOL. Tumbling share prices, which have affected T-Online in particular, have also stifled potential deals, since stock remains the favoured currency for takeovers in the internet sector.",

And it was thereby further enacted, that all and every person and persons that then were, or afterwards should be reconciled to, or shall hold communion with the see or Church of Rome, or should profess the popish religion, or marry a papist, should be excluded, and are by that Act made for ever incapable to inherit, possess, or enjoy the Crown and government of this realm, and Ireland, and the dominions thereunto belonging, or any part of the same, or to have, use, or exercise any regal power, authority, or jurisdiction within the same: and in all and every such case and cases the people of these realms shall be and are thereby absolved of their allegiance: and that the said Crown and government shall from time to time descend to and be enjoyed by such person or persons, being Protestants, as should have inherited and enjoyed the same, in case the said person or persons, so reconciled, holding communion, professing or marrying, as aforesaid, were naturally dead. After the making of which statute, and the settlement therein contained, your majesty's good subjects, who were restored to the full and free possession and enjoyment of their religion, rights, and liberties, by the providence of God giving success to your majesty's just undertakings and unwearied endeavours for that purpose, had no greater temporal felicity to hope or wish for, that to see a royal progeny descending from Your Majesty, to whom (under God) they owe their tranquillity, and whose ancestors have for many years been principal assertors of the reformed religion and the liberties of Europe, and from our said most gracious sovereign lady, whose memory will always be precious to the subjects of these realms: and it having since pleased Almighty God to take away our said sovereign Lady, and also the most hopeful Prince William, Duke of Gloucester (the only surviving issue of Her Royal Highness the Princess Anne of Denmark) to the unspeakable grief and sorrow of Your Majesty and your said good subjects, who under such losses being sensibly put in mind, that it standeth wholly in the pleasure of Almighty God to prolong the lives of Your Majesty and of Her Royal Highness, and to grant to Your Majesty, or to Her Royal Highness, such issue as may be inheritable to the Crown and regal government aforesaid, by the respective limitations in the said recited act contained, do constantly implore the divine mercy for those blessings: and Your Majesty's said subjects having daily experience of your royal care and concern for the present and future welfare of these Kingdoms, and particularly recommending from your throne a further provision to be made for the succession of the Crown in the Protestant line, for the happiness of the nation, and the security of our religion; and it being absolutely necessary for the safety, peace, and quiet of this realm, to obviate all doubts and contentions in the same, by reason of any pretended title to the Crown, and to maintain a certainty in the succession thereof, to which your subjects may safely have recourse for their protection, in case the limitations in the said recited act should determine.

      "body": "<p>The Roman Catholic church was embroiled in new controversy yesterday after it admitted that a former chaplain at one of London's leading state schools, who was HIV-positive when he died two years ago, has been accused of sexually abusing at least one pupil. </p> <p>Father David Martin, who died of bronchopneumonia at a London hospital at the age of 44 in September 1998, had been acting chaplain one day a week at the Oratory School in west London, where the prime minister's sons, Euan and Nicholas, are now pupils. </p> <p>Last night a spokesman for the church admitted that successive heads of Father Martin's religious order, the Oratory Fathers, had known that he was HIV positive several years before he was ordained in 1994. </p> <p>It was not known whether they passed that information to the school before he started work there in 1997. </p> <p>Claims about his conduct surfaced in a letter to Hammersmith and Fulham social services department last week. Earlier letters making less specific allegations were sent to leading figures in the church including the Archbishop of Westminster, Cormac Murphy O'Connor and to national newspapers in late October and were also referred to Hammersmith and Fulham. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Westminster diocese said: \"Naturally the church is deeply concerned whenever any allegations are made against a priest and especially if there are any victims of abuse. Any allegations need to be fully investigated and the church authorities will cooperate fully.\" </p> <p>In a terse statement, Father Ignatius Harrison, provost of the Oratory Fathers, of which Father Martin had been a member, said only that the order was fully aware of the investigation. He later added that there had never been any concerns about Father Martin's behaviour. </p> <p>Father Michael Napier, the provost of the order at the time Father Martin joined in 1988 and at the time of his ordination in 1994, is now also dead. Church sources said that Martin had been diagnosed HIV positive in 1991 - and had confided in Father Napier.

      "bodyText": "The Roman Catholic church was embroiled in new controversy yesterday after it admitted that a former chaplain at one of London's leading state schools, who was HIV-positive when he died two years ago, has been accused of sexually abusing at least one pupil. Father David Martin, who died of bronchopneumonia at a London hospital at the age of 44 in September 1998, had been acting chaplain one day a week at the Oratory School in west London, where the prime minister's sons, Euan and Nicholas, are now pupils. Last night a spokesman for the church admitted that successive heads of Father Martin's religious order, the Oratory Fathers, had known that he was HIV positive several years before he was ordained in 1994. It was not known whether they passed that information to the school before he started work there in 1997. Claims about his conduct surfaced in a letter to Hammersmith and Fulham social services department last week. Earlier letters making less specific allegations were sent to leading figures in the church including the Archbishop of Westminster, Cormac Murphy O'Connor and to national newspapers in late October and were also referred to Hammersmith and Fulham. A spokesman for the Westminster diocese said: \"Naturally the church is deeply concerned whenever any allegations are made against a priest and especially if there are any victims of abuse. Any allegations need to be fully investigated and the church authorities will cooperate fully.\" In a terse statement, Father Ignatius Harrison, provost of the Oratory Fathers, of which Father Martin had been a member, said only that the order was fully aware of the investigation. He later added that there had never been any concerns about Father Martin's behaviour. Father Michael Napier, the provost of the order at the time Father Martin joined in 1988 and at the time of his ordination in 1994, is now also dead. Church sources said that Martin had been diagnosed HIV positive in 1991 - and had confided in Father Napier. The information was subsequently given to Father Harrison when he succeeded as provost in 1996. The church was unable to say whether the school had carried out its own checks when he was recommended to them by the order as a governor and chaplain. Father Martin continued to visit the school until July 1998. Child protection officers were yesterday attempting to establish the identity of the boy who made the complaints. They have only a first name to go on. \"There was a child protection meeting six weeks ago but they considered that there was no evidence with which to base any further investigations, because the letter was anonymous, there was no specific allegation of child abuse, and obviously Father Martin was dead,\" said a spokeswoman for Hammersmith and Fulham. The latest letter alleging child abuse came from a boy claiming to be at the school. The allegation is that abuse of one boy took place away from the school and unconnected with school activities, but relating to the priest's church work. On Monday social services and the police held a meeting and decided to launch an investigation. The council's child protection team met officers yesterday. They are looking again at the earlier letters. ChildLine founder and chairman Esther Rantzen confirmed that the telephone helpline had been contacted by children making allegations of abuse at the school. The inquiry is hampered by the unclear lines of responsibility. Father Martin was chaplain at the school for four terms but was employed not by them but by the Oratory Fathers. Father Martin attended the school weekly, mainly to prepare boys for confirmation. He had previously been director of music at the Brompton Oratory and was instrumental in setting up a choir school there. Father Martin graduated from St Andrews university in 1976. He entered the priesthood as a novice in 1988. A statement released on behalf of the priest's father, James Martin, from Ayr, said: \"We are devastated by news of this. It has come as a complete shock to us all.\" Priests in the dock 1996 Father Adrian McLeish of Durham sentenced to six years for abusing boys aged 10 to 18 and exchanging internet pornography. 1997 Father Michael Walsh jailed for five years for indecent assault and gross indecency over a 19 year period.

But the sales pitch, of unsurpassed countryside and historic canalside towns crammed with listed buildings, is not designed for tourists. Rather, it marks the first serious campaign to persuade people to leave an overcrowded London with the promise of cheaper housing, more space, and a much lower cost of living up north. Recognising its growing housing shortage, with 5,000 people vainly waiting for council homes, the London borough of Camden has signed an agreement with Kirklees council - otherwise known as Greater Huddersfield - to take families unable to find accommodation in the capital. \"Camden, like most of London's 32 boroughs, simply cannot meet demand for low cost housing with tens of thousands on the waiting list in the capital. \"This is not a case of persuading people to move into unpleasant, difficult to let homes\", said Camden's spokesman, David Petrie. \"Huddersfield has a lot of empty houses that would be snapped up if they were in London, and it has a lot more to offer as well.\" Emie Townsend would certainly agree.

But in contrast to London, it says, there is a surplus in other towns and cities, \"where the local population may have decreased and where property prices are much lower\". The London borough, which last year offered council housing to under 1,400 people from 6,000 applicants, has even arranged a bus trip to take families around Kirklees, immortalised as Last of the Summer Wine country, as the TV series was filmed in the nearby town of Holmfirth. It has given other families, such as Emie Townsend and her daughter, the train fare to take a closer look.

But who or what can help you? According to the largest survey of people's views on treatment for mental illness, to be published on Friday, there are few options available, or informed choices made, when it comes to the use of psychiatric drugs. </p> <p>A Question of Choice, produced by three charities, the National Schizophrenia Fellowship (NSF), Manic Depression Fellowship and Mind, reveals that 62% of people suffering mental illness had no choice of medication, and almost half stopped taking it without medical advice. </p> <p>Most of the 2,663 people surveyed had diagnoses of schizophrenia, although many had manic depression or depression. The two main drug treatments for schizophrenia are \"typical\" and \"atypical\" antipsychotics. </p> <p>The typicals (common ones are haloperidol, chlorpromazine and stelazine) have been around longest. While they help some people, they can cause severe long-term side-effects, sometimes irreversible even if treatment is stopped. The drugs are banned in parts of the US, following law suits linked to side-effects, and, according to Gary Hogman, head of policy and campaigns at the NSF, some British experts say such drugs would not be licensed if they were being introduced to the market now. </p> <p>Atypicals - such as olanzapine, clozapine and risperidone - are the newer, growing group. Their side-effects are usually milder, and a striking finding from the survey relates to people's experiences of these versus typical antipsychotics. Asked \"Which was the worst medicine you've ever had?\", the highest ranked drugs were the three common typicals. And the best? The three atypicals - plus lithium, used mainly for manic depression. </p> <p>Doctors can prescribe from either category, yet 84% of drugs used for schizophrenia are typical antipsychotics. The higher cost of atypicals, and conservative tendencies within the medical profession, may override clinical judgment and patient preference. Hogman says the survey shows that what is lacking, and must be provided, is choice. \"People want comprehensive information, and to be allowed to choose what works best for them, not always get the cheapest option or whatever the doctor usually gives,\" he says. </p> <p>Hogman argues that prescribing cheaper drugs is short-sighted. \"Some people on typical antipsychotics need other drugs to combat side-effects. They frequently stop taking medication and, as a result, relapse is common. </p> <p>\"In short, many people are given drugs which they hate, and don't stick with, even though there are alternatives. It's a false economy. Their symptoms are not controlled, they may have repeated hospital admissions, at high cost to health, social care and sometimes the criminal justice system, and have seriously and needlessly impaired quality of life.\" </p> <p>The national institute for clinical excellence (Nice), which advises the government on medical interventions, has just announced that it will assess drugs for schizophrenia - a process expected to take a year before yielding recommendations. The NSF hopes that this evaluation will not pay more attention to cold data of controlled trials than to hard evidence - the experiences of people who take the drugs. </p> <p>The value of medication, for many, is clear from the survey. When asked \"What single thing had or could make the biggest difference to quality of life?\", the largest number cited medication. This included people for whom medicine has already made the biggest difference and those who view improved medicine as the best thing that could happen. </p> <p>But the survey does not end there. It also asked people's views about non-drug treatments - from psychotherapy to exercise. </p> <p>As Hogman says: \"Medication was our starting point, but the survey's main colour is its illustration of the importance of a holistic approach. It demonstrates that those who are unwell benefit immensely from the occupational and leisure activities that we all like.\" </p> <p>This holistic approach to mental illness is the cornerstone of NSF philosophy, based on recognising the interplay between mental and physical health. </p> <p>Hogman says: \"It's just common sense. There aren't two groups in society, ill people and well people. Mental illness affects all walks of life. Most people know what they need and enjoy - such as having enough money, pleasant accommodation, things to do and people to share them with - and those who are ill are no exception. </p> <p>\"Without these things, the risk of people suffering illness is increased, and getting better and staying well is more difficult. The picture is further complicated by the fact that the illness itself impedes ability to access them.\" </p> <p>Mental Health Foundation statistics support these views: psychiatric admissions are three times greater in government-defined \"deprived\" areas, and the risk of suicide among the unemployed is 11 times higher than among those in work. </p> <p>These figures and the survey's findings do not solve the mysteries of what causes mental illness, nor do they imply that good housing or jobs can alone prevent people from becoming ill, or cure them. </p> <p>However, many interacting factors, from genetics to the environment, are important in causing mental illness and give clues as to useful interventions. </p> <p>One of the survey's most striking statistics is that the most appreciated interventions are not complex or specialised. Exercise, training and education were ranked top by 85% of those who had tried them, and art/music therapy was best liked by 81%. It is another indication from the survey that drawing boundaries between the needs of the well and those of the ill is frequently artificial and unhelpful. </p> <p> <strong>How birdwatching and art brought a new focus</strong><br></p> <p> Julian Swan's story illustrates how combining medication, non-drug treatments and social inclusion can dramatically help even those with severe, long-lasting illness. </p> <p>Diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1992, after hearing voices for 16 years, Julian says freedom to choose his treatment was fundamental to recovery. \"I told the psychiatrist that if I wasn't better in three months I'd kill myself,\" he recalls. \"He was so responsive, but imposed nothing.

      "bodyText": "Front Row Television is this week embarking on an ambitious relaunch, kicking off with a new national TV advertising campaign. Advertising for the pay-per-view venture, jointly owned by NTL and TeleWest, will position it as the must-have cable service for quality movies. Two 30-second ads, created by banc, will air nationally from Friday and run until the end of the year with the new endline, \"Front Row - You decide\". The service recently announced that it had increased its output to include 85% of the available titles at the UK Box Office, which it will claim is equal and possibly greater than any other on-demand movie operator. The campaign coincides with the recent repackaging of the Front Row service, which now includes increased choice of programming, a revamped on-air presence and more targeted programming. The first execution features a couple at home in front of the TV basing their choice of film on the toss of a ping-pong ball into a variety of glass containers on the coffee table. The second shows two girls basing their choice of film on the colour of the underpants of an overweight builder who has been working outside their flat. The ads were written by Glenn Smith, art directed by Craig Roderick and directed by Dominic Rixson of ON Demand Productions.",

The new inquiry, expected to take six months, is to be carried out under the Competition Act, which became law in March. The legislation prohibits firms from abusing their market position and making agreements which damage competition. If the OFT concludes that BSkyB has abused its position or made anti-competitive deals it could fine the company up to 10% of its UK turnover since March - more than \u00a3100m. The investigation - which follows an OFT review into BSkyB launched in January - comes after repeated complaints from the rival broadcaster ONdigital concerning the prices BSkyB charges for its programming. ONdigital, one of Sky's biggest customers, claims the satellite broadcaster's prices affect the way ONdigital sells its own service and the prices it has to charge its customers. ONdigital argues that having bought the rights to most of the top UK sports and the best films, BSkyB is now setting prices that prevent competition is therefore abusing its dominant position. Yesterday the OFT emphasised it was starting the investigation with an open mind, but under the Competition Act the OFT director general, John Vickers, must have reasonable grounds for suspecting breaches of the law before he can start an investigation. Last night an ONdigital spokesman said: \"We welcome this inquiry which we have been asking for for some time.\" BSkyB said it would work with the consumer watchdog on the new investigation. In a statement it said: \"Sky will continue to cooperate with the OFT.\" The satellite firm said it had recently been \"striking much more attractive deals\", such as that with its other rival NTL, as a result of increased competition in broadcasting. If BSkyB fails to cooperate, the OFT now has a range of powers, including the right to enter premises by force and to take away documents. BSkyB gave the OFT a number of undertakings in 1996 to soothe fears of an unfair advantage over smaller cable firms.

      "body": "<p>The Israeli-Palestinian conflict could rapidly deteriorate into a regional war, the United Nations special envoy to the Middle East, Terje Roed-Larsen, warned yesterday.</p> <p>He urged Israel to lift its blockade of Palestinian areas. \"The situation as it is now is not tenable,\" he said. \"It may continue the way it is right now for a few more weeks ... It could deteriorate sharply, dramatically and tragically, which may produce regional spillovers, so we will face a regional war.\"</p> <p>Israel imposed the blockade in October, citing security reasons, but Palestinians say it is a collective punishment which has put thousands out of work.</p> <p>Mr Roed-Larsen, a Norwegian, was a key figure in the secret talks between the PLO and Israel which produced the Oslo accords in 1993, and is a mediator whose views are respected by both sides.</p> <p>\"Palestinian living conditions are falling fast, and safety nets are wearing thin,\" he said. A \"stark increase\" in poverty since the beginning of the intifada had left almost half the Palestinians living on less than nine shekels (\u00a31.63) a day, he added. \"We need a massive opening up of the Palestinian territories, and we need it very quickly.\"</p> <p>He said the Palestinians had succeeded in cutting unemployment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from 30% in 1996 to 12% last year, but it had risen to 40% - more than 260,000 people - as a result of the blockade.</p> <p>\"Three years of progress have been wiped out in two months of conflict.\"</p> <p>Because each worker supports several people, Mr Roed-Larsen estimated that more than 1m Palestinians had suffered a serious loss of income. The Palestinian Authority was no longer able to pay public employees, he added.</p> <p>He estimated that the Palestinian economy had lost more than \u00a3345m in the first 60 days of the crisis, and the losses were continuing at \u00a36.8m a day.</p> <p>The figures do not include the cost of caring for more than 9,000 wounded Palestinians, nor lost taxes, which are likely to run into the hundreds of millions of pounds, nor the damage to infrastructure.</p> <p>The al-Mazen Centre for Human Rights in Gaza claims that Israeli heavy weapons partly or totally destroyed 431 houses, 13 public buildings, 10 factories and 14 religious buildings in the first six weeks of the conflict.</p> <p>The uprooting of trees - which will take years to replace - will also have a lasting impact on livelihoods. The Palestinian agriculture ministry estimates that the Israeli army and settlers have destroyed more than 44,000 trees, mainly grapevines and other agricultural trees.</p> <p>The Israelis say such measures are necessary for security, though they are also a way of pressuring Palestinians.</p> <p>Some Israelis want tougher measures, including further economic isolation. There have also been hints that the Israel Electric Corporation, which says it is owed \u00a32.8m by the Palestinian Authority, may cut off power supplies.</p> <p>Others, including the Shin Bet intelligence service, say a tougher line would make people more desperate and encourage attacks in Israel.</p> <p>Calling the blockade \"completely counter-productive\", Mr Roed-Larsen said yesterday: \"This policy is fuelling anger and is the major instrument for the radicalisation of the population. The risk here is that one produces through these policies a new generation of Palestinians where hatred, anger and resentment will stay for decades.</p> <p>\"This, in the longer and shorter term, is the greatest threat to the security situation.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, some 30,000 Palestinian mourners attended a funeral in Gaza City for Awad Selmi, a senior activist in the armed wing of Hamas who was killed in an explosion, allegedly while planting a bomb. Hamas vowed revenge for his death and dismissed negotiations as an option for peace.</p> <p>Despite such mass protests, Mr Roed-Larsen believes it \"possible to repair the situation and bring the Oslo process back by reviving talks.\"</p> <p>\"The most important steps on the economic front rest with the Israeli government.\"</p> <p>His remarks came after the Israeli group Peace Now called for the immediate evacuation of the 6,500 Israeli settlers in Gaza, followed by the gradual, but not prolonged withdrawal of a further 100,000 settlers from West Bank areas with a large Palestinian population. It also proposed a territorial exchange with the Palestinians of areas in the West Bank with a high Jewish population, such as Gush Etzion.</p> <p>The plan, reported yesterday in Ha'aretz, said: \"The evacuation should take place by offering alternative housing inside Israel, in areas which will be agreed upon with the settlers.\"</p> <p>\u0095Gun battles continued to rage in the West Bank and Gaza late last night, capping a day in which soldiers shot dead two Palestinians who took part in rock-throwing protests.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the Jordanian capital, Amman, unidentified gunmen shot and wounded an Israeli embassy employee as he left a shop in an upmarket area of the city last night. The police said he suffered a gunshot wound to his left foot.</p> <p><b>Useful links:</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\" target=\"_new\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict could rapidly deteriorate into a regional war, the United Nations special envoy to the Middle East, Terje Roed-Larsen, warned yesterday. He urged Israel to lift its blockade of Palestinian areas. \"The situation as it is now is not tenable,\" he said. \"It may continue the way it is right now for a few more weeks ... It could deteriorate sharply, dramatically and tragically, which may produce regional spillovers, so we will face a regional war.\" Israel imposed the blockade in October, citing security reasons, but Palestinians say it is a collective punishment which has put thousands out of work. Mr Roed-Larsen, a Norwegian, was a key figure in the secret talks between the PLO and Israel which produced the Oslo accords in 1993, and is a mediator whose views are respected by both sides. \"Palestinian living conditions are falling fast, and safety nets are wearing thin,\" he said. A \"stark increase\" in poverty since the beginning of the intifada had left almost half the Palestinians living on less than nine shekels (\u00a31.63) a day, he added. \"We need a massive opening up of the Palestinian territories, and we need it very quickly.\" He said the Palestinians had succeeded in cutting unemployment in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from 30% in 1996 to 12% last year, but it had risen to 40% - more than 260,000 people - as a result of the blockade. \"Three years of progress have been wiped out in two months of conflict.\" Because each worker supports several people, Mr Roed-Larsen estimated that more than 1m Palestinians had suffered a serious loss of income. The Palestinian Authority was no longer able to pay public employees, he added. He estimated that the Palestinian economy had lost more than \u00a3345m in the first 60 days of the crisis, and the losses were continuing at \u00a36.8m a day. The figures do not include the cost of caring for more than 9,000 wounded Palestinians, nor lost taxes, which are likely to run into the hundreds of millions of pounds, nor the damage to infrastructure. The al-Mazen Centre for Human Rights in Gaza claims that Israeli heavy weapons partly or totally destroyed 431 houses, 13 public buildings, 10 factories and 14 religious buildings in the first six weeks of the conflict. The uprooting of trees - which will take years to replace - will also have a lasting impact on livelihoods. The Palestinian agriculture ministry estimates that the Israeli army and settlers have destroyed more than 44,000 trees, mainly grapevines and other agricultural trees. The Israelis say such measures are necessary for security, though they are also a way of pressuring Palestinians. Some Israelis want tougher measures, including further economic isolation. There have also been hints that the Israel Electric Corporation, which says it is owed \u00a32.8m by the Palestinian Authority, may cut off power supplies. Others, including the Shin Bet intelligence service, say a tougher line would make people more desperate and encourage attacks in Israel. Calling the blockade \"completely counter-productive\", Mr Roed-Larsen said yesterday: \"This policy is fuelling anger and is the major instrument for the radicalisation of the population. The risk here is that one produces through these policies a new generation of Palestinians where hatred, anger and resentment will stay for decades. \"This, in the longer and shorter term, is the greatest threat to the security situation.\" Yesterday, some 30,000 Palestinian mourners attended a funeral in Gaza City for Awad Selmi, a senior activist in the armed wing of Hamas who was killed in an explosion, allegedly while planting a bomb. Hamas vowed revenge for his death and dismissed negotiations as an option for peace. Despite such mass protests, Mr Roed-Larsen believes it \"possible to repair the situation and bring the Oslo process back by reviving talks.\" \"The most important steps on the economic front rest with the Israeli government.\" His remarks came after the Israeli group Peace Now called for the immediate evacuation of the 6,500 Israeli settlers in Gaza, followed by the gradual, but not prolonged withdrawal of a further 100,000 settlers from West Bank areas with a large Palestinian population. It also proposed a territorial exchange with the Palestinians of areas in the West Bank with a high Jewish population, such as Gush Etzion. The plan, reported yesterday in Ha'aretz, said: \"The evacuation should take place by offering alternative housing inside Israel, in areas which will be agreed upon with the settlers.\" \u0095Gun battles continued to rage in the West Bank and Gaza late last night, capping a day in which soldiers shot dead two Palestinians who took part in rock-throwing protests. Meanwhile, in the Jordanian capital, Amman, unidentified gunmen shot and wounded an Israeli embassy employee as he left a shop in an upmarket area of the city last night. The police said he suffered a gunshot wound to his left foot. Useful links: Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group) Hamas",

As Mr Bush spoke in Texas, his Republican running mate Dick Cheney also reflected his party's conviction that the contest with Al Gore is swinging their way by telling congressional leaders in Washington that the transition to a Bush presidency was \"up and running and operational\". Republican delight at Monday's dismissal of Mr Gore's legal challenge to the election results in Florida was plain for all to see as the Bush-Cheney team began to increase the tempo of their push for power. \"The judge gave a very thorough opinion yesterday. It was a definitive opinion,\" Mr Bush said as he arrived at the Texas capitol building in Austin. Earlier he had received his first direct national security briefing from CIA officials since he and Mr Gore were both briefed on international intelligence developments last week. Officially the Bush team is sticking to its decision not to appear premature in laying claim to the White House before the Florida courts have finished hearing Mr Gore's challenges. Mr Bush even went out of his way to appear magnanimous towards his rival yesterday, telling reporters that Mr Gore faced \"a difficult decision\". \"I can understand what he may be going through. It's been a very interesting time for both of us,\" he added. But the reality is that the Bush-Cheney team now believes it is only days away from forcing Mr Gore to concede the election, given Judge N Sanders Sauls's ruling against the vice-president in Tallahassee on Monday. \"We feel very good about what happened,\" Mr Cheney said on Capitol Hill, where he discussed transition and legislative prospects with the House Speaker, Dennis Hastert, and other Republican congressional leaders. \"Hopefully we will be able to get on in fairly short order with the business of preparing for governing.\" That confidence found some support in the latest opinion surveys which showed that 63% of Americans believe Mr Bush has now won the presidency.

Much of the discussion between Mr Bush and Mr Cheney and congressional Republicans focused on whether there are enough votes on Capitol Hill for Mr Bush to drive through the tax cutting programme which was the centrepiece of his campaign.

Mr Lieberman said the Florida supreme court, which sits tomorrow, would be the \"final arbiter\" of the dispute.

      "body": "<p>You deliver a defensible rebuke to the African National Congress for the shortcomings of its government (Rainbow Blues, December 5). It is, however, indefensibly simplistic. You say it is not good enough to continue heaping all the blame on the legacy of apartheid, six years after the end of white minority rule. That is true. Yet the legacy is real and persistently malign in the economic disparities between white and black.</p> <p>The macroeconomic research group (Merg) report of 1993 offered a cautious programme for economic growth with the objective of reducing such disparities. It was shelved by the leadership of the ANC, largely in response to pressures from western governments. In its place there emerged a neo-liberal economic policy, with \"black empowerment\" at its decorative edges. This has enriched relatively few blacks, while predictably failing to \"trickle down\" in the socially transforming provision of jobs, schools, housing. Corruption, incidentally part of the apartheid legacy, may thrive in such circumstances. It does so in the US, among other western societies.</p> <p>Mounting electoral support for the Democratic Alliance may or may not serve to maintain a pluralist democracy. Certainly, it will not confront a failed economic policy with which the Democratic Alliance is even more infatuated. <br><b>Ronald Segal</b><br>Walton-on-Thames, Surrey</p> <p>Chris McGreal (Mandela attacks \"black stooges\" deserting ANC in droves, December 4) claims that the Democratic party (now the Democratic Alliance) ran \"a thinly disguised racist presidential campaign last year\". It is true that the African National Congress did accuse the DP of \"racism\" (as well as \"neo-Nazism\") but this should be seen for what it is - crude propaganda.</p> <p>The ANC was unable to produce a single quote, policy or pamphlet that could reasonably be construed as \"racist\". The fact that the ANC made similar accusations of \"racism\" against the Mail &amp; Guardian earlier this year, should have given McGreal some pause for thought. The DP campaign, although critical of the ANC, was based on liberal and non-racial principles. A survey in February this year found that only 3% of black (African) respondents ascribed the DP's success at the last election to racism. This is compared to the 22% who ascribed it to good organisation and communication, and 17% who ascribed it to the non-racial platform of the party. Propaganda is supposed to sway the ignorant masses, not Guardian foreign correspondents. <br><b> James Myburgh</b>Democratic party<br>Cape Town<br><a href=\"mailto:dpres2@iafrica.com\">dpres2@iafrica.com</a></p> <p>Since it is known that Aids is not a disease capable of cure, but an immune system deficiency that leaves people vulnerable to every disease going, isn't it sensible to attack the \"causes\" of those diseases? That means increasing hope and hygiene, which means reducing poverty. So why don't we give credit to Thabo Mbeki as the only head of state with the guts to risk the ire of the pharmaceutical companies by asking for help instead of just agreeing to put more money in their pockets?<br><b> Barbara Waddell</b><br> London</p> <p>The fact that a rich country like Botswana has the highest rate of HIV infection in Africa (While the world looks away, December 2) shows how absurd Mbeki's hypothesis is that Aids is more due to poverty than to HIV. Instead of undermining the anti-HIV campaign and spending \u00a33bn (R43m) on arms, the South African government should educate its people and buy medicine for their sick.<br><b>Mikael Grut</b> <br> London <br><a href=\"maito:mgrut@compuserve.com\">mgrut@compuserve.com</a></p>",

You say it is not good enough to continue heaping all the blame on the legacy of apartheid, six years after the end of white minority rule. That is true. Yet the legacy is real and persistently malign in the economic disparities between white and black. The macroeconomic research group (Merg) report of 1993 offered a cautious programme for economic growth with the objective of reducing such disparities. It was shelved by the leadership of the ANC, largely in response to pressures from western governments. In its place there emerged a neo-liberal economic policy, with \"black empowerment\" at its decorative edges. This has enriched relatively few blacks, while predictably failing to \"trickle down\" in the socially transforming provision of jobs, schools, housing. Corruption, incidentally part of the apartheid legacy, may thrive in such circumstances. It does so in the US, among other western societies. Mounting electoral support for the Democratic Alliance may or may not serve to maintain a pluralist democracy. Certainly, it will not confront a failed economic policy with which the Democratic Alliance is even more infatuated. Ronald Segal Walton-on-Thames, Surrey Chris McGreal (Mandela attacks \"black stooges\" deserting ANC in droves, December 4) claims that the Democratic party (now the Democratic Alliance) ran \"a thinly disguised racist presidential campaign last year\". It is true that the African National Congress did accuse the DP of \"racism\" (as well as \"neo-Nazism\") but this should be seen for what it is - crude propaganda. The ANC was unable to produce a single quote, policy or pamphlet that could reasonably be construed as \"racist\". The fact that the ANC made similar accusations of \"racism\" against the Mail &amp; Guardian earlier this year, should have given McGreal some pause for thought. The DP campaign, although critical of the ANC, was based on liberal and non-racial principles. A survey in February this year found that only 3% of black (African) respondents ascribed the DP's success at the last election to racism. This is compared to the 22% who ascribed it to good organisation and communication, and 17% who ascribed it to the non-racial platform of the party. Propaganda is supposed to sway the ignorant masses, not Guardian foreign correspondents. James MyburghDemocratic party Cape Town dpres2@iafrica.com Since it is known that Aids is not a disease capable of cure, but an immune system deficiency that leaves people vulnerable to every disease going, isn't it sensible to attack the \"causes\" of those diseases? That means increasing hope and hygiene, which means reducing poverty. So why don't we give credit to Thabo Mbeki as the only head of state with the guts to risk the ire of the pharmaceutical companies by asking for help instead of just agreeing to put more money in their pockets? Barbara Waddell London The fact that a rich country like Botswana has the highest rate of HIV infection in Africa (While the world looks away, December 2) shows how absurd Mbeki's hypothesis is that Aids is more due to poverty than to HIV. Instead of undermining the anti-HIV campaign and spending \u00a33bn (R43m) on arms, the South African government should educate its people and buy medicine for their sick.

These would come on top of existing cuts involving 4,500 staff, although Sir Brian refused to say what scale of redundancies was likely. Jeremy Fletcher, steel analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, said: \"The scale of the restructuring is going to be very large. This [the management changes] signals the board is determined to get this sorted.\" The steel union ISTC said Corus employees were \"shocked and alarmed\" by the day's announcements, which came as the company was seeing growth in demand and a fall in the strength of the pound. Michael Leahy, ISTC general secretary, called for an early meeting with management and government action over \"this alarming threat to the nation's manufacturing base\". Sir Brian admitted the currency situation had eased in recent days but said there was too much uncertainty surrounding its future direction while the trading scene \"was not as strong as it was.\" Corus has been exporting 50% of its UK steel products, compared to 30% ten years ago.",

Share prices in the US staged their strongest rally in months as investors took heart from his comments and signs that the presidential contest may be nearing conclusion. The Nasdaq composite was up more than 7%, or 200 points, at midday at 2,820, while the Dow Jones rose almost 3% to 10,835. Trading curbs, used frequently in the past few months to prevent a freefall, were triggered to stop the Dow rising too quickly as investors welcomed signs that the Fed may cut interest rates amid signs of a slowing economy. There was a knock-on effect for stock markets in Europe, with London closing 2% higher and 3% gains being recorded in Paris and Frankfurt. Prices of US treasury bonds also rose as investors rushed to buy the notes. Mr Greenspan said that the pace of economic growth had \"moderated appreciably\". His comments were taken as a clear sign that the Fed would soften its hawkish stance on inflation when it next meets later this month as a prelude to cutting rates next year. The Fed has raised interest rates six times since June 1999 in an effort to calm inflation fears and cool a raging US economy. Since April, however, US stock markets have plummeted as consumers and corporations have stopped spending and doubts have been raised about the value of internet shares. Speaking to a group of community bankers in New York yesterday, Mr Greenspan said: \"In an economy that already has lost some momentum, one must remain alert to the possibility that greater caution and weakening asset values in financial markets could precipitate an excessive softening in household and business spending.\" His remarks were taken as a sign that the Fed no longer sees inflation as the greatest threat to the US economy and could cut rates to ensure a soft rather than a hard landing. Kevin Logan, a senior market economist at Dresdner Bank in New York, said Mr Greenspan's remarks made it clear that the Fed was contemplating a rate cut, perhaps as early as January. American markets were also cheered by two court decisions that dealt a blow to the presidential ambitions of Al Gore late on Monday. Companies felt to have most to gain from a George W Bush presidency led yesterday's advance, including Microsoft, the software group which is appealing the competition lawsuit brought by the US government, and Philip Morris, the world's largest tobacco company.",

Market gossips reckon news on the disposal of its automotive division, a leftover from its merger with engineering concern TI Group, could be on the way. The deadline for bids was Monday and, according to the gossips, three high-profile private equity groups have tabled offers. This should ensure a lively auction for the operation, which makes fuel-storage and delivery systems, and could push the asking price up to the \u00a31.2bn Smiths is said to be looking for. According to the chatter, Bain Capital, Blackstone, the US firm that owns the Savoy and Claridge's, and Doughty Hanson, which recently acquired RMH, the food production arm of conglomerate Tomkins, for \u00a31.25bn, are the interested parties.",

The company was floated 10 months ago at 195p a share, giving it a stock market value of \u00a3130m. But it has felt the brunt of the changing sentiment towards hi-techs. Ahead of yesterday's trading statement, the shares were down to 155p, valuing the company at \u00a3104m. Dataflex, which makes routers for telecom companies, then produced a bit of good news of its own. It said that first-half results, due to be announced towards the end of next month, would exceed expectations, not least because of accelerated deliveries to Centrica, the utilities and services group with which it has a \u00a310m contract. It said it was continuing to explore opportunities in new markets and had signed initial contracts worth \u00a31.3m with telecom companies in Spain, Poland and Portugal. But the really good news came on Monday when John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco, said his company was expecting annual growth of up to 60%. There is little doubt that whatever happens to the dot.com companies - and the outlook there remains bleak - the makers of the telecom equipment upon which the internet is built should survive and prosper. Even if e-retailing takes a nose dive, the fast growing e-commerce between companies will ensure that telecom operators will continue to invest in networking equipment. So Dataflex, once part of Sir Alan Sugar's Amstrad, should do well provided the management successfully exploits the opportunities. There is also an outside possibility that a successful Dataflex could attract the attentions of the acquisitive Cisco. Dataflex shares closed 6.7% higher yesterday at 164.5p.

The auction of licences saw firms bidding for the right to beam internet signals to rooftop aerials and was seen as a way of breaking BT's stranglehold on high-speed internet access. But all may not be lost. Many small start-ups are experimenting with technology that may rescue ministers' ambitious plans. </p> <p>Radiant Networks, a Cambridge-based start-up, has developed a novel way of connecting to the net at high speed over the airwaves.

Since then Radiant has moved quickly. In April it closed its third round of funding, raising \u00a312m from UK-based Advent Venture Partners and the American venture capital firm Sandler Capital Management. Mr Jackson is looking to float at the start of 2002 and so far the company is well on track. </p> <p>There are many who believe that \"wireless broadband\" will take off. Washington-based telecoms analysts, Strategis, estimate the wireless broadband access market will be worth $10bn by 2003. But sentiment towards the sector is volatile. The government's auction of wireless licences raised just \u00a338.16m, compared with independent estimates of \u00a31bn. </p> <p>Unlike Radiant's technology, existing wireless broadband systems work in a similar way to mobile phone networks. Your antenna connects directly to a network base station. Unfortunately, because of the high frequencies involved in broadband, there has to be a clear line of sight between the two points. This means that in urban locations tall buildings and trees obscure the signal and many costly base-stations have to be installed to boost coverage. </p> <p>Radiant says its system does not have this problem. It does away with base stations and instead bounces signals off neighbouring antennas to get around buildings and other obstructions. Your antenna need only be able to see another sibling antenna and you are connected. </p> <p>However it is not without drawbacks. FirstMark, the German internet access provider, is field testing Radiant's systems in the next few months and says that there are disadvantages with its network. </p> <p>\"Mesh deployment only starts working well in a saturated market - the more customers the better and easier it is to make new installations,\" says Bill Best, FirstMark's chief technology officer. </p> <p>\"The drawback of Radiant's technology is that in its early days you may not have line of sight from a new customer to the existing network and therefore have to put in an extra node to connect them up. That's a sunk cost really because you wouldn't get any benefit from that extra node until more customers sign up. Rival conventional systems try to get over this problem by boosting the power signal at the base station,\" he said. </p> <p>\"With base stations that use high power from a high vantage point - say the top of a hill overlooking a city - you can cover a huge area all at once.\" </p> <p>Radiant is not the only firm aiming to deliver broadband. Other wireless rivals have already got kit on the market. Tele2, a Reading-based company owned by Dutch telcom Millicom InternationalCellular, offers wireless broadband services - using existing technology - in Reading, Leeds, Bradford and Leicester. It is investing heavily to extend its coverage to 40 other areas over the next 18 months. In October it launched its 128Kbit per second residential wireless service at \u00a39.99 a month - enough for fast internet access but not for digital video on demand. </p> <p>\"We expect to have 200,000 users within the next three years,\" says Elliott Mueller, chief executive of Tele2. \"Our main focus will be SMEs [small and medium sized enterprises] who pay between \u00a365 and \u00a31,500 a month for dedicated services, depending on the bandwidth they require. But in future we hope to cover more residential customers too and provide them with enough bandwidth for video on demand.\" </p> <p>Tele2 secured a licence on the 3.6GHz waveband earlier this year without having to participate in the government's fixed wireless broadband licence auction. \"We only have to pay an annual subscription fee to the government to use the bandwidth,\" says Mr Mueller. Analysts say Tele2 pays hundreds of thousands of pounds a year in fees for the privilege. </p> <p>Tim Johnson, an analyst at Ovum, is sceptical about Tele2's plans. \"Most companies say 'we'll go for SMEs. SMEs need broadband'. The problem is every broadband provider is saying that and there are not enough SMEs to go around,\" he says. \"I think that realisation was one of the reasons why the broadband wireless auction was so unexciting.\" </p> <p>FirstMark has been snapping up broadband wireless licences across Europe - but was one of the companies that backed out of the UK's recent auction. It will begin field testing Radiant's systems in the next few months and is considering other wavebands on offer outside the auction. </p> <p>Radiant estimates an antenna will cost around \u00a31,000 and hopes the price will drop to \u00a3600 by 2003. \"When its available in volume we'll be making a residential offer,\" says Mr Best. \"Until then our main markets will be [small businesses].\" </p> <p>FirstMark has not priced its service yet, but Mr Best says he intends to be competitive with ADSL. \"I think the price of wireless broadband will drop the same way mobile phone costs did over the last ten years,\" he says. \"In the 1980s the Motorola 'brick' phone cost \u00a31,000, now you can get one for free. For broadband wireless it's just a matter of time.\"</p>",

Analysts say Tele2 pays hundreds of thousands of pounds a year in fees for the privilege. Tim Johnson, an analyst at Ovum, is sceptical about Tele2's plans. \"Most companies say 'we'll go for SMEs. SMEs need broadband'. The problem is every broadband provider is saying that and there are not enough SMEs to go around,\" he says. \"I think that realisation was one of the reasons why the broadband wireless auction was so unexciting.\" FirstMark has been snapping up broadband wireless licences across Europe - but was one of the companies that backed out of the UK's recent auction. It will begin field testing Radiant's systems in the next few months and is considering other wavebands on offer outside the auction. Radiant estimates an antenna will cost around \u00a31,000 and hopes the price will drop to \u00a3600 by 2003. \"When its available in volume we'll be making a residential offer,\" says Mr Best. \"Until then our main markets will be [small businesses].\" FirstMark has not priced its service yet, but Mr Best says he intends to be competitive with ADSL. \"I think the price of wireless broadband will drop the same way mobile phone costs did over the last ten years,\" he says. \"In the 1980s the Motorola 'brick' phone cost \u00a31,000, now you can get one for free. For broadband wireless it's just a matter of time.\"",

An open letter published in the daily newspaper Izvestiya marked the latest controversy in a prolonged search for appropriate symbols to represent post-communist Russia. This week the Duma is expected to approve a bizarre mixture of soviet and tsarist emblems as the official iconography of new Russia, including the old anthem, (with new, as yet undecided verses), the tsarist two-headed eagle as the state coat of arms, and the pre-revolutionary tricolor as the national flag.

With his expansive forehead, beady little eyes and spout of a mouth - which work together to bless him with the countenance of a nervous Toby jug - it is quite understandable that you might have assumed Keith Andrews was indeed a member of the aristocracy. With his title, the Marquis of St Leger, sounding enough like it could be the name of a pub to make it seem authentic, even some posh folks thought him one of their own and clasped him to their hefty, mothball-smelling bosom. </p> <p>Only Keith wasn't landed or gentry at all. He was a social worker who lived on a Swindon housing estate with his mother and was one of the impostors revealed in the rather intriguing <strong> ID</strong> (Channel 5). </p> <p>Others discussed in the programme used devious means to achieve dishonest ends when they traded identities and denied their selves.

With his expansive forehead, beady little eyes and spout of a mouth - which work together to bless him with the countenance of a nervous Toby jug - it is quite understandable that you might have assumed Keith Andrews was indeed a member of the aristocracy. With his title, the Marquis of St Leger, sounding enough like it could be the name of a pub to make it seem authentic, even some posh folks thought him one of their own and clasped him to their hefty, mothball-smelling bosom. Only Keith wasn't landed or gentry at all. He was a social worker who lived on a Swindon housing estate with his mother and was one of the impostors revealed in the rather intriguing ID (Channel 5). Others discussed in the programme used devious means to achieve dishonest ends when they traded identities and denied their selves.

The opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi has launched a competition to find the best poster from dozens that ridicule his baldness as well as his policies and ambition. By urging supporters to laugh at them he hopes to neutralise a potent threat to his centre-right coalition. Samples of the posters have been posted on his party's website, www.forza-italia.it on the grounds that they confirm the success of its campaign. Denouncing the stunt as an outrageous hijack, supporters of the centre-left government vowed to devise more parodies. In the past two months Mr Berlusconi, 64, has flooded Italy with pictures of his smiling face next to slogans promising a brighter future if, as polls suggest, he wins the elections due in spring. Each week he has unveiled a new \"concrete promise\" - \"less tax for all\", \"safer cities\", \"a good job also for you\". But the suspicion that the photograph of the media magnate was taken 10 years ago, when he had more hair and fewer wrinkles, prompted a wave of puns. \"A concrete promise: more hair for all,\" was followed swiftly by other posters promising toys, cannabis and sex. Caricatures of Mr Berlusconi in costume have become hugely popular. As a Star Trek Klingon he promises a teletransporter, as a shaman he promises to find the yeti, as an astronaut he promises a lunar colony, as a cardinal he promises to become Pope, and as Darth Vader he promises to conquer Saturn. Newspapers and television stations not owned by Mr Berlusconi have gleefully paraded the exposure of what critics call his overweening ambition. A depiction of the former prime minister with a pencil moustache and Sicilian cap, promising \"a good contract for all\", reminded voters of the corruption allegations he faced.

I take another, equally slippy, route back down the field and suddenly come across a large unfamiliar form in the growing darkness, which turns out to be a tangle of branches. A huge limb has broken away from an old oak. As I take this in, another sense takes me over completely - smell. The leaves and broken wood give off the powerful aroma of oak: a dark, peaty, beer-like tannin scent which increases in potency as I breathe it in. As the smell intensifies it becomes sweeter, until it is more like the fragrance of summer roses. It evokes strings of memory which weave into an experience beyond itself, into something new. There are so few words to describe smells; we have an olfactory memory which is an associative thing and we only seem to be able to describe it by saying it is like something else. This smell has become unlike anything else and although it conjures up experience it is also creating it. Night sets in.",

He peers though his binoculars at the enemy positions on the distant hills, draws a quick diagram in the dust for the other commanders and then angrily barks new orders over the radio in Persian.</p> <p>Across the Kokcha river just below this hill, Masood faces the artillery positions of the Taliban, the Islamic students who chased him out of the capital, Kabul, four years ago. A stone's throw to his right is the border with Tajikistan, a key military supply route through which his allies Russia, Iran and India send equipment and support. Behind him lies Badakshan, the mountainous province he cannot afford to lose and the last in Afghanistan under his complete control.</p> <p>For the past four months the Taliban have fought harder than ever to push back Masood's forces and draw a noose around his military base and family home in the Panjsher valley, in central Afghanistan. \"If they win Badakshan, they win the war,\" the gaunt 47-year-old says in halting French. \"The Taliban think they can take Badakshan and encircle the Panjsher. But in the end they will never succeed in Afghanistan.\"</p> <p>To his men Masood is revered as the Lion of the Panjsher. Well-educated, a devout Muslim and a brilliant military tactician, he defended the Panjsher Valley against the invading Soviet army through 10 years of war. His face and his trademark brown wool cap are still plastered on teahouse walls across northern Afghanistan.</p> <p>After the Soviets retreated, the mojahedin commanders fought between themselves and in 1992 Masood's forces won control of Kabul. But four years later, when the Taliban swept through southern Afghanistan and into Kabul, Masood fled to the Panjsher and returned to his guerrilla war. Today he holds less than 10% of the country.</p> <p>Yet the people of the north still adore him. His intellect and his charm seem oddly out of place in a nation destroyed by two decades of fighting and so different from the poorly educated, doctrinaire and misogynistic Taliban. \"I used to read Che Guevara and Mao Tse-tung. I learned from Mao, but not Che. He was too simple. Victor Hugo is still the writer I prefer. But now there is little time to read.\"</p> <p>Masood has never been in a more dangerous position. In early September, after days of heavy jet and artillery bombardments, the Taliban seized the strategic town of Taloqan, the ousted government's administrative headquarters. Masood's forces fled.</p> <p>As the Taliban advanced they imposed their strict brand of Islam, beating men who trim their beards and interrupting football matches to make the crowds pray. Women are banned from working and rarely allowed to leave their homes. Men were encouraged to black out their windows so their wives and daughters could not be seen from outside the home.</p> <p>More than 80,000 people fled the area around Taloqan as the fighting grew closer. Packing their few belongings onto their donkeys they walked east in search of shelter. Most now face a bitterly cold winter in Badakshan, living under plastic sheeting praying for food handouts from aid agencies. They came with harrowing accounts of the brutality of Taliban occupation: houses burned and looted, civilians killed and young men and women abducted.</p> <p>\"I saw Taliban soldiers knock on the door of the house next to ours during the night and they took a young girl. She was 25 and her name was Bekea,\" says Farzana, a 27-year-old woman who fled with her children to Faizabad, the largest town still under opposition control. \"The Taliban said one of them would marry her. Now we don't know if she is alive or dead.\"</p> <p>The fall of Taloqan was a bitter blow for Masood, cutting a major supply route linking Tajikistan and the Panjsher. Nearly 350 of his fighters, the mojahedin or \"holy warriors\", were killed in the battle and 500 injured. \"We had some problems with logistics and transport. We can't fight in every part of Afghanistan at the same time,\" he says.</p> <p>He claimed the Taliban suffered 2,000 killed and injured. Analysts have put the Taliban's death toll at 1,500 in the fighting this summer.</p> <p>Masood has been awake since before dawn, kneeling in prayer in the cold autumn morning outside the shabby, four-roomed house which has become his base, an hour's drive from the frontline. After praying he paces alone in the rose garden watching the sun rise before breakfast and the first of his meetings with his commanders and military allies. Over a meal of tea, a slice of Afghan bread and cheese, he plans the day's attack.</p> <p>By the afternoon Masood is back at the front, stopping his tank drivers to give them final instructions before his artillery and multi-barrel rocket launchers open up on the Taliban positions. His khaki trousers tucked into polished, black boots, Masood watches through binoculars as three mojahedin tanks climb the distant hill towards the Taliban posts. He breaks from the fighting just once, to lead his men in prayer before sunset when they kneel facing west to their enemy and to Mecca beyond.</p> <p>\"This is just the beginning,\" he says. \"Our first target is to take back Taloqan, God willing, before the winter. But these days the Taliban are advancing more cautiously and now they have Pakistani backing and tanks.\" Pakistan's military government is the Taliban's biggest ally and one of only three countries to recognise the regime, but Islamabad has always denied its troops are fighting in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Masood has said he is ready for negotiations with the Taliban and tentative talks have begun, but few observers expect the Islamic militia to give up their dominant military position. \"There will be resistance inside Afghanistan and we need pressure from the outside on Pakistan,\" he says. \"Even if the fighting is finished, the Taliban movement cannot continue, they cannot stay united.\" There is a note of resignation in his voice. Afghanistan's last mojahedin commander knows he must win back Taloqan before the winter, or face a final defeat.</p>",

Another is the sudden proliferation of well-dressed drunks weaving around the streets. The Christmas office party serves up its winter bacchanal. </p> <p>For the comedian, the Christmas firm do provides extra cash and very tough gigs. You are liable to have to follow the company panto, written by the marketing manager, whose secret ambition is to get a sketch on The News Huddlines. Although it is very, very bad, it is hugely successful because everyone loves to see their co-workers make arses of themselves. </p> <p>The comic is greeted with indifference - the real business being to get drunk, settle scores and choose a candidate for the traditional embrace in the photocopying room. There must, by law, be an \"incident\" to sustain office gossip through the long, pointless months of January and February. </p> <p>A few years ago I was on stage at such an event. The audience was irredeemably pissed - too pissed to understand my most Neanderthal joke. I tried the classic one-liner - \"Arsenal are shit\" - but even this was too sophisticated. I resorted to getting one of the sottish hecklers on stage, where he announced exuberantly, \"I'm so arseholed!\" Not much of an insight but it was met with clapping and cheering.

      "bodyText": "One sign that Christmas is coming is that somewhere very far away and very hot Mike Atherton is grinding out a draw in a Test match. Another is the sudden proliferation of well-dressed drunks weaving around the streets. The Christmas office party serves up its winter bacchanal. For the comedian, the Christmas firm do provides extra cash and very tough gigs. You are liable to have to follow the company panto, written by the marketing manager, whose secret ambition is to get a sketch on The News Huddlines. Although it is very, very bad, it is hugely successful because everyone loves to see their co-workers make arses of themselves. The comic is greeted with indifference - the real business being to get drunk, settle scores and choose a candidate for the traditional embrace in the photocopying room. There must, by law, be an \"incident\" to sustain office gossip through the long, pointless months of January and February. A few years ago I was on stage at such an event. The audience was irredeemably pissed - too pissed to understand my most Neanderthal joke. I tried the classic one-liner - \"Arsenal are shit\" - but even this was too sophisticated. I resorted to getting one of the sottish hecklers on stage, where he announced exuberantly, \"I'm so arseholed!\" Not much of an insight but it was met with clapping and cheering. He seemed to run out of material, so I asked him how long he'd worked for the company. \"Too fucking long!\" More cheering. \"What do you think of the managing director?\" I asked. \"He's a cunt!\" This caused a tumult of laughter and applause. As I left, he was sitting on the stairs, head in hands. He had been fired by the MD in question, a man clearly determined to confirm his by now public sobriquet.

We relive our own childhoods by encouraging our children to read what we once read, feel what we once felt. It is what makes the adaptations good box office.

There is a feeling that these texts are classic and beyond reproach. Yet we are experiencing our own golden age of children's literature, with novelists such as Melvin Burgess, David Almond, Philip Pullman and Jacqueline Wilson engaging with the realities of modern childhood. </p> <p>It seems odd that theatre should hark back to a body of work, a lot of it more than 100 years old, written by authors who in many cases were at best unhappy or socially inadequate, at worst possibly paedophiles. As Tony Graham of London's Unicorn Theatre points out: \"Writers such as David Almond are creating work where the metaphors are as big as anything in The Secret Garden.\" </p> <p>One reason for our constant return to a theatre of Victorian values is economic.

We no longer let our children play alone in the park, yet in the safety of the theatre we are happy to send them into someone else's garden or enchanted wardrobe. We would, of course, be horrified if our children really did run away with the pirates (Treasure Island) or fly off to Never Never Land. We'd be ringing 999 before you could say, \"I believe in fairies\". </p> <p>But Philip Ridley, who writes plays for adults as well as younger audiences, believes that these stage adaptations can serve a useful purpose for children themselves and don't just have to be a backwards glance at a lost Arcadia. </p> <p>\"What the wardrobe and the garden symbolise is not necessarily a retreat but a way of connecting our children with their feelings.

We're obsessed with it, apparently. </p> <p>Newspapers and magazines are constantly telling us just how obsessed we are, ignoring the fact that the phenomenon is entirely a media creation.

Go for dinner at the Ivy and you have to wade through paparazzi to get in the door. What's going on? What does it all mean? </p> <p>Being famous for trivial reasons is nothing new: a fashionable 18th-century woman might have achieved celebrity status because of a predilection for outrageous wigs, or, indeed, sleeping with this or that society figure. But her fame was local and contained. Then, if you appeared regularly at the theatre with your wig done up like a galleon, all London might know your name. Now, thanks to the media, the entire world could know not only your name, but where you buy your underwear. (The more famous you are, the more such minutiae is deemed to be of legitimate interest.) Presumably, the desire for attention existed then, as it does now, but now, if that's what you crave, you can have so much more of it. </p> <p>Perhaps the feeling of being visible and known somehow heightens your sense of your own reality - \"I'm here, I exist, I'm real.\" Conversely, does invisibility make you somehow less than real? In a culture snowed under with images, both live and virtual, being looked at would seem to be a validation in itself. When we think of celebrities, we see them as somehow more real than the rest of us and, at the same time, less so. </p> <p>More real, because of the heightened nature of their reality - huge cinema images, constant media portrayals. Less real because the nature of celebrity blurs the distinction between public and private. It's easy to assume that all aspects of a celebrity life are there purely to be picked over because he or she is on show, which means he or she doesn't have the same reality as everyone else. </p> <p>Look at Princess Diana. By conferring iconic status on her, we coincidentally removed some of her humanity, and consequently thought it reasonable to rummage through her private life with impunity because, actually, she wasn't real. </p> <p>Given this ghastly invasion of one's life, why is celebrity status so desirable? Ask an average bunch of 10-year-olds what they want to do with their lives, and a large proportion of them will tell you they'd like to \"be famous\". Not for anything in particular. Just famous, period. In the adult population, otherwise perfectly normal people think nothing of spilling the beans about their personal tragedies on daytime television. As if somehow your tragedy hasn't really happened until it is witnessed and dissected by the viewing public. </p> <p>Fame allows you to transcend the time you live in. Perhaps this is what we are seeking in our hunger for celebrity: nothing less than immortality. In an irreligious age, we've lost the notion of an afterlife. We no longer believe our lives have any meaning outside ourselves and the quotidian stumble from birth to grave. Celebrity status gives the illusion that you will survive beyond this precise moment. </p> <p>But which \"you\" is that? The problem with being caught up in the attention of others is that the viewer is the one who decides who you are and what you mean. In fact, you will mean whatever the viewer wants you to mean. Which is probably not what you meant at all. In seeking to be a personality, the celebrity concedes her essential personality in favour of an ersatz one, invented and invested in by strangers. </p> <p>I'm describing a world of which we're all part. Most of us, thank god, aren't \"celebrities\". But we're all caught up in the roaring cult of personality which threatens all notions of meaning and proportion in our dealings with the world. We can't avoid it unless we banish our television sets, never go to the cinema, and refuse forthwith to ever open a newspaper.

This seems to me to be damaging not just for the consumer of art or politics, but for the person whose personality is being plundered for such marketing purposes. The self is a fragile and complex thing. A person is not a marketing tool. The fact that most of us are seduced, one way or another, by the glitter of celebrity, doesn't make it less disturbing. </p> <p>I leave you with some words by William Faulkner: \"It is my ambition, as a private individual, to be abolished and voided from history, leaving it markless, no refuse save the printed words.

Some call it postmodern.</p> <p>Such a bold step was thought necessary to prevent Venice becoming entirely populated by tourists.</p> <p>This week dignitaries toasted the levelling of a former refrigeration warehouse. Cranes are about to start razing about half a mile of decaying customs houses, harbours and houses on both sides of the Giudecca canal, near the area known as Zattere.</p> <p>The late Spanish architect Enrico Miralles Moya drew on the waterfronts of London, Sydney and Copenhagen to beat 500 entries in an international competition.</p> <p>He described his plan as a way to invent and build in a city which adopted repetition as its way of growing. His \"citadel\" will house libraries, shops, cultural centres, auditoriums and lecture halls.</p> <p>There will also be banks, bars and restaurants: the citadel will be open to all.</p> <p>The urgency of attracting new blood overcame Venetian qualms about erecting a monumental incongruity.</p> <p>Only 50,000 people live in the city now, but 10m visit each year, an invasion that has sent residents fleeing to the mainland.</p> <p>\"It is a sign of change in the traditional Venetian dialectic between doing and not doing,\" the mayor, Paolo Costa, said. \"I hope that Venice can enrich the album of western architecture with contemporary pages such as this.\"</p> <p>Zattere is where heavy goods were unloaded, but it is now a popular spot for strolls and picnics. The church of Santa Maria del Rosario, with ceiling frescoes by Tiepolo, is nearby.</p> <p>A transparent corridor will run through the campus to a wide staircase sweeping down to the canal.</p> <p>\"We will soon see the return of a city teeming with life, with students, with tourists,\" commented La Repubblica newspaper.</p> <p>\"A challenge that will broaden the confines of Venice and create another fragment of beauty that has been hidden until now.\"</p> <p>Yesterday Mr Costa unveiled the Venice Laboratory of Culture, an attempt to control the tourist influx which may worsen next year since there are many attractive events, including the reopening of the Malibran theatre after a 15-year restoration, and a new wing of the Guggenheim museum dedicated to the landscape artist Giovanni Segantini.</p> <p>Thirty public and private institutions will join forces to run <a href=\"http://www.veneziacultura.it\" target=\"_NEW\">www.veneziacultura.it,</a> a website intended to monitor and regulate prospective visits.</p> <p>Mr Costa revived the question of squeezing money from tourists to fund building maintenance.</p> <p>\"We risk disappearing due to excess love,\" he said.</p> <p>Last month hundreds of shopkeepers marched in St Mark's Square in protest at the authorities' failure to stop high tides flooding the city.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Venice has started demolishing dilapidated canalside buildings to make way for a concrete and glass campus modelled on London's Docklands and other famous urban waterfronts. It aims to reverse centuries of population drain by attracting students to an ultra-modern site designed to offer a dramatic contrast to the surrounding Renaissance palaces. Some call it postmodern. Such a bold step was thought necessary to prevent Venice becoming entirely populated by tourists. This week dignitaries toasted the levelling of a former refrigeration warehouse. Cranes are about to start razing about half a mile of decaying customs houses, harbours and houses on both sides of the Giudecca canal, near the area known as Zattere. The late Spanish architect Enrico Miralles Moya drew on the waterfronts of London, Sydney and Copenhagen to beat 500 entries in an international competition. He described his plan as a way to invent and build in a city which adopted repetition as its way of growing. His \"citadel\" will house libraries, shops, cultural centres, auditoriums and lecture halls. There will also be banks, bars and restaurants: the citadel will be open to all. The urgency of attracting new blood overcame Venetian qualms about erecting a monumental incongruity. Only 50,000 people live in the city now, but 10m visit each year, an invasion that has sent residents fleeing to the mainland. \"It is a sign of change in the traditional Venetian dialectic between doing and not doing,\" the mayor, Paolo Costa, said. \"I hope that Venice can enrich the album of western architecture with contemporary pages such as this.\" Zattere is where heavy goods were unloaded, but it is now a popular spot for strolls and picnics. The church of Santa Maria del Rosario, with ceiling frescoes by Tiepolo, is nearby. A transparent corridor will run through the campus to a wide staircase sweeping down to the canal. \"We will soon see the return of a city teeming with life, with students, with tourists,\" commented La Repubblica newspaper. \"A challenge that will broaden the confines of Venice and create another fragment of beauty that has been hidden until now.\" Yesterday Mr Costa unveiled the Venice Laboratory of Culture, an attempt to control the tourist influx which may worsen next year since there are many attractive events, including the reopening of the Malibran theatre after a 15-year restoration, and a new wing of the Guggenheim museum dedicated to the landscape artist Giovanni Segantini. Thirty public and private institutions will join forces to run www.veneziacultura.it, a website intended to monitor and regulate prospective visits. Mr Costa revived the question of squeezing money from tourists to fund building maintenance. \"We risk disappearing due to excess love,\" he said. Last month hundreds of shopkeepers marched in St Mark's Square in protest at the authorities' failure to stop high tides flooding the city.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair was given notice of a long term ambition to achieve closer EU integration last night with the disclosure of a German-Italian plan for another inter-governmental conference, similar to this week's in Nice, as early as 2004. The proposal, disclosed in a joint paper sent to France, holder of the EU's rotating presidency, has no official status and may be part of a negotiating strategy to win concessions in France. But it runs counter to Labour's stance on IGCs with Mr Blair previously insisting that such a conference should not take place until after EU expansion had begun. Plans for a so-called \"post-Nice\" agenda have emerged in the last few days as the most significant item on the summit agenda, with more integrationist-minded countries pushing for a commitment to further change in the coming years. Germany and Italy are calling for discussion of the future status of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, simplification of existing EU treaties, a charter of competences defining the powers of the union and those of national governments, and possibly also changes to the European parliament. From a British point of view, this is a highly toxic mixture of issues with a clear integrationist bent and as such is certain to be unwelcome to a government already highly conscious of Eurosceptic criticism. Britain won the battle for the charter of rights not to be incorporated into the new treaty, agreeing that it be simply \"proclaimed\" at Nice. But the issue has not gone away. The only surprise is that it has come back so soon. The new paper has appeared on the same day that Peter Mandelson, the fiercely pro-Europe Northern Ireland secretary, rejected the project of the EU's founding fathers, pronouncing the death of \"ever closer European union\" which they envisaged in the 1956 Treaty of Rome. His remarks on the eve of this week's Nice summit strengthen a call by a pro-European thinktank urging Britain to campaign for the removal of the key clause in the preamble to the 1956 treaty which founded the original \"common market\". The call has been made by the Foreign Policy Centre, known to be close to Foreign Office thinking. Speaking at an FPC meeting, Mr Mandelson said future historians would see the Nice summit as \"a landmark in the reunification of Europe drawing a clear line on the turmoils and divisions of the past century\". His remarks came as Downing Street outlined Mr Blair's five aims for Nice and renewed its attack on the Eurosceptic British media for relentless criticism of the EU. Mr Blair will seek an enlarged union to include former communist states to the east; more influence for Britain via extra votes in EU councils; a smaller and better EU bureaucracy; a more flexible EU with no \"pioneer\" group; and fewer national vetoes, but only where it is in the UK's interests. The Tories attacked Labour's agenda, but insisted they \"passionately\" want to see enlargement too. In remarks designed to outflank British Eurosceptics, Mr Mandelson predicted the Nice treaty would not be fundamental in content, but would have great significance in its effect by \"opening the EU's door\" to a dozen applicants. He also claimed pro Europeans were now \"amongst those who are least committed to the traditions of the EU's founding fathers\". He stressed it would be a \"tremendous setback\" for the whole of Europe, including the applicant countries to the east, if there was no agreement at Nice. An enlarged EU was a key strategic objective for Britain and absolutely vital to the future prosperity and security of the EU.",

The trouble, though, is that redistributing wealth, unlike nationalising things, is the real reason that Labour exists, and the real reason why people vote for it. Without redistribution, it's nothing.</p> <p>That's why, of the five Labour prime ministers we have seen so far, the only one whose government still exerts magic over Labour's supporters is the one led by Clement Attlee between 1945 and 1951. Becoming prime minister in the harshest economic circumstances faced by any post-war government, he never had the smallest doubt that he was there, as modern politicians would put it, to tax and spend. His first chancellor, Hugh Dalton, said he would find money to revive deprived areas \"with a song in my heart\".</p> <p>Attlee opposed targeted benefits, let alone targeted tax cuts. He believed that welfare benefits and other public services were for everyone, not just the poor. Services for the poor are generally poor services.</p> <p>Attlee, Labour's most successful prime minister, is a problem for New Labour. The Attlee government, which created the National Health Service and the welfare state, is too strong an icon in Labour circles to be openly derided, but was far too radical to be emulated. The New Labour line on Attlee, therefore, is that he failed because he did not win a full second term.</p> <p>But what's Attlee's line on Blair? Attlee would have disliked pretty well everything about New Labour, both the style and the substance.</p> <p>The unforgiving way in which New Labour isolates and marginalises its leftwing critics would have appalled Attlee. He had seen it happen under Labour's first prime minister, Ramsay Macdonald, and did not like it. Macdonald excluded the key figure on the left, former housing minister John Wheatley, as well as all the other leftwing leaders, from his 1929 government. Wheatley was a towering figure in the 1920s, and his exclusion was seen by the Times, rightly, as \"a declaration of war on the left\".</p> <p>The nearest equivalent to Wheatley in 1945 was Nye Bevan, and Attlee gave him the key job of health and housing, even though Bevan had almost been expelled from the party just a year earlier, and had been a thorn in the side of the leadership for 15 years. Bevan would surely not have found a place in a Macdonald cabinet or a Blair cabinet.</p> <p>John Strachey had a place in Attlee's government, despite years flirting with the communists. So did George Buchanan, who had been expelled from the Labour party as a member of the rebel leftwing Independent Labour party. Ellen Wilkinson became minister of education, even though she had been a leftwing rebel in the 1920s and had spent the 1930s plotting to get Attlee ejected as leader and replaced by Herbert Morrison.</p> <p>Attlee liked the unions, and his closest friend and ally, Ernest Bevin, was a union man first, and only a politician as a very late afterthought. You did not hear union chiefs complaining, as John Monks once did about Mr Blair, that they were being treated like \"embarrassing elderly relatives at a family gathering\".</p> <p>It is said that Attlee's terse, understated manner would have had him destined for oblivion. He was naked to the world, with no spin doctors and no image. People seem to think that images and spin doctors were personally invented by Peter Mandelson after a visit to Washington. Attlee's spin doctor was an experienced Fleet Street editor called Francis Williams. If his name was not well known, it is because, unlike Blair's various spin doctors, Williams was a good professional, and understood that the moment the press officer is as well known to the public as his boss, he is on his way to becoming useless.</p> <p>Williams did his work quietly, and Attlee left him to get on with it. Attlee did not want to know the details. When Williams wanted a telex machine in Number 10, so that he could see what stories the news agencies were running, he sold the idea by telling the prime minister that it would give him the up to date score at Lords, and Attlee was startled one day to see \"my cricket machine\" churning out the decisions of that morning's cabinet. He had not realised that Williams routinely briefed the political correspondents, but was not at all taken aback when this was explained to him.</p> <p>Attlee had an image, too. A wise man, he avoided Neil Kinnock's ambitious, doomed attempt to create an entirely new persona. He ensured that his image was fairly close to the reality. It suited him to be thought a dull little man, and to sound rather like a suburban bank manager. Such people can make revolutions, as Attlee did, and no one will be frightened. It is exactly the opposite method to the present PM, who has no revolution to offer, but calls every piddling initiative a \"crusade\".</p> <p>Most of all, Attlee would have revolted against the totemic use of the words \"new\" and \"modern\", suspecting they were euphemisms for abandoning the underdog for whom he believed Labour existed. We can be quite sure about this. In 1950 Herbert Morrison became the first Labour politician - his grandson Peter Mandelson is the latest - to use control of the publicity machine to in fluence policy. He wrote a paper for the national executive saying Labour must \"modernise.\" Britain was becoming more middle class, so the only question for policy-makers was: how much of Labour's traditional agenda will middle-class voters stand for? Attlee stifled the idea, and would have stifled \"modernisation\" at birth if he were leader today.</p> <p>Of course, New Labour could say that this simply proves their point. Had he accepted the Morrison initiative he might not have lost the 1951 election. I doubt it. There were deeper factors at work on the electorate than Labour's refusal to \"modernise\". The Conservatives had spent their six wilderness years rethinking their policies, and were led by a national hero. Today's Conservatives have wasted their opposition years, and are led by a national joke.</p> <p>Labour narrowly lost in 1951 to a reinvigorated Conservative party, which had taken to its heart the lessons of its 1945 defeat and adapted accordingly, and was led by Winston Churchill. That's a very different animal to the Conservative party that New Labour will face next year. If all the disappointments have been in the cause of winning a second term, then New Labour had better win it, or some very awkward questions will be asked about the benefits of \"modernisation\".</p> <p>\u0095 Francis Beckett's book, Clem Attlee, is published by Politicos at \u00a312.99.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Nato could become a \"relic of history\" if European members of the Atlantic alliance do not sort out their new relationship with it, the US defence secretary, William Cohen, warned yesterday. Speaking in Brussels, Mr Cohen issued the starkest warning yet that plans to forge an autonomous European Union defence capability must be closely coordinated with Nato or cause real damage. \"There will be no EU caucus in Nato,\" Mr Cohen insisted in an unusually passionate and unscripted speech to alliance defence ministers, including Britain's Geoff Hoon. \"If ... they try to or are desirous of a separate operational planning capability, separate and distinct from Nato itself, then that is going to weaken ties between the US and Nato and Nato and the EU,\" he said . \"There should be a single planning operation, and not duplicative and redundant, because that will only weaken Nato itself.\" The American defence secretary also warned there were \"too many questions\" hanging over the project. Mr Cohen, leaving office with the outgoing Clinton administration, was backed, though more cautiously, by the alliance secretary-general, Lord Robertson. Diplomats insisted last night that Mr Cohen's remarks were \"valedictory and philosophical\" rather than representing a change of policy by Washington. It was the latest sign of anxiety in the US at EU plans, unveiled last month, for a 60,000-strong rapid reaction corps separate from Nato but likely to use alliance equipment and assets. Mr Hoon later played down Mr Cohen's remarks. He dismissed suggestions that Mr Cohen had opened up an untimely rift over the new Euro force. \"He in a sense is warning about the same things that we have been warning about: we should not duplicate,\" he said. Lord Robertson said: \"I think secretary Cohen was right to warn us. And ministers were right to listen carefully to what he said.\"",

In Southwark, the borough in which Damilola was fatally stabbed, the quota of 800 officers is 46 down.</p> <p>In an area where the average cost of a terraced house is \u00a3185,000, police, in common with nurses and teachers, can no longer afford to buy or rent in the private sector on salaries which start at \u00a323,000 including a housing allowance of \u00a33,327, Ms Harman said.</p> <p>The problem has been exacerbated by the previous government's decision, in 1994, to sell off police housing stock and freeze the housing allowance.</p> <p>\"They find they are earning enough to buy in a suburb and then they start to question why they should travel into central London when they can earn the same amount and do easier work policing near their home,\" she warned.</p> <p>She added that the home secretary, Jack Straw, should back the move.</p> <p>But Glen Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, last night warned it would prove unpopular with police, who felt they needed to live outside areas they patrolled, for their own protection.</p> <p>Touring the half-demolished north Peckham estate where Damilola bled to death, Ms Harman said its inhabitants were increasingly carrying knives as status symbols in a community where their chances of good jobs were consistently curtailed by discrimination.</p> <p>\"There is clearly a sense that this is an unequal society where you are blocked by the colour of your skin, and there is a feeling that you achieve status not by getting a degree or by qualifications but by having a knife,\" she said.</p> <p>The growing problem of knife carrying appeared to have developed since children on Peckham's five neighbouring estates had seen their well-educated immigrant parents unable to put their degrees to good use in London.</p> <p>\"Three quarters of the African cab drivers in Peckham have degrees. So how can their children believe their education is worth striving for?\" Ms Harman said.</p> <p>\"It is in this atmosphere that some carry knives and turn to crime.\"</p> <p>The solution, she added, might lie, in increased resources for Peckham's schools, which, in the case of the Oliver Goldsmith which Damilola attended, had one of the lowest scores in national league tables, with only one in four of its 11-year-olds gaining the expected standard in English.</p> <p>In the meantime, parents on the Peckham estate were trying to rectify the problems themselves - either by sending children back home to the West Indies or Africa to be educated, or by dispatching them to a private, Christian Fellowship school on the estate that they could ill afford.</p> <p><b>Related special report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/\" target=\"_new\">Policing crime</a><br> <b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,404947,00.html\">30 November: Straw appeals to public after 'evil' schoolboy murder</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404836,00.html\">30 November: 'My son is dead and I am bitter'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/leaders/story/0,3604,404700,00.html\">30 November, leader: Death in Peckham</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404901,00.html\">30 November: Head defends bullying record</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/article/0,2763,404903,00.html\">30 November: Estate is 'one of toughest in Europe'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,404333,00.html\">29 November: Death of a schoolboy</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4097793,00.html\">29 November: It's lawless out there</a><br><br><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Metropolitan police</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">The home office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/reports/100/100821.pdf\" target=\"_new\">Ofsted report: the Oliver Goldsmith primary school</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.southlondononline.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Local media: South London online</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.southwark.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">London borough of Southwark</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.thereal.com/o-041798.html\" target=\"_new\">Photographs of the North Peckham estate</a></p>",

Harriet Harman, a former social security secretary and the MP for Camberwell and Peckham, said police were deserting her borough, forced out by central London property prices. The only hope of recruiting and retaining them was for the council to offer them new houses, even if it meant forcing out other tenants. \"It is controversial because it means you are reducing the number of homes available, but I think we have to have police living in the community,\" she said. \"We can't recruit police without sorting out the housing issue - but we also need this to regenerate society. \"People feel safer when they have police living on their estate, and they are also pleased because they feel that if police live among them, they are totally in tune with their issues.\" Ms Harman's call came after the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, warned of an inner city policing crisis, with London having a 3,000 shortfall. In Southwark, the borough in which Damilola was fatally stabbed, the quota of 800 officers is 46 down. In an area where the average cost of a terraced house is \u00a3185,000, police, in common with nurses and teachers, can no longer afford to buy or rent in the private sector on salaries which start at \u00a323,000 including a housing allowance of \u00a33,327, Ms Harman said. The problem has been exacerbated by the previous government's decision, in 1994, to sell off police housing stock and freeze the housing allowance. \"They find they are earning enough to buy in a suburb and then they start to question why they should travel into central London when they can earn the same amount and do easier work policing near their home,\" she warned. She added that the home secretary, Jack Straw, should back the move. But Glen Smyth, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, last night warned it would prove unpopular with police, who felt they needed to live outside areas they patrolled, for their own protection. Touring the half-demolished north Peckham estate where Damilola bled to death, Ms Harman said its inhabitants were increasingly carrying knives as status symbols in a community where their chances of good jobs were consistently curtailed by discrimination. \"There is clearly a sense that this is an unequal society where you are blocked by the colour of your skin, and there is a feeling that you achieve status not by getting a degree or by qualifications but by having a knife,\" she said. The growing problem of knife carrying appeared to have developed since children on Peckham's five neighbouring estates had seen their well-educated immigrant parents unable to put their degrees to good use in London. \"Three quarters of the African cab drivers in Peckham have degrees. So how can their children believe their education is worth striving for?\" Ms Harman said. \"It is in this atmosphere that some carry knives and turn to crime.\" The solution, she added, might lie, in increased resources for Peckham's schools, which, in the case of the Oliver Goldsmith which Damilola attended, had one of the lowest scores in national league tables, with only one in four of its 11-year-olds gaining the expected standard in English. In the meantime, parents on the Peckham estate were trying to rectify the problems themselves - either by sending children back home to the West Indies or Africa to be educated, or by dispatching them to a private, Christian Fellowship school on the estate that they could ill afford.

Some train companies have also warned that passengers who booked Christmas train trips several weeks ago face disruption as services are altered or cancelled altogether due to timetable changes. Last night a spokesman for GNER said their delayed Christmas train timetable would be released on Monday.

Alan Hyde, a GNER spokesman, blamed speed restrictions for delaying timetables, saying it was impossible to give accurate timetable information until Railtrack provided exact details of restrictions. \"We wanted to put together a robust and deliverable timetable, which will be published in full on Monday.\" He said they have been taking Christmas bookings since October but confirmed that timetable delays will mean some passengers who booked in advance will have to be reallocated to other train times.

Another 70 people who were delayed by up to seven hours because of a power failure on the same line south of Bedford will receive similar payments. The train companies face big compensation bills from delayed passengers, though some of these may be passed on to Railtrack.

      "body": "<p>After last week's column, I wouldn't want readers to glean the impression that only black or Irish people die at the hands of agents of the state. Harry Stanley was a white Scotsman, who popped into a Hackney pub for a quick soft drink, and minutes later was gunned down by armed police.</p> <p>It has to be said, however, that whoever phoned 999 to report a suspicious looking man in the pub, described him as having an Irish accent. In future, East End villains will be able to save a fortune on their hit-man bills. They'll simply report a person as being Irish and the police will do it for them. And what better way to deal with nuisance neighbours?</p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service announced on Monday that no officers in this case are to be charged. One might take the words \"insufficient evidence\" seriously were it not for the fact that the crown has for years ushered legions of innocent people into jail on the flimsiest of evidence and then fought tooth and nail to keep them there. I'm sure if that, if the Metropolitan Police had decided to fit Harry Stanley up with something instead of shooting him in the head, the CPS would have done everything possible to assist them.</p> <p>However, crown prosecutors must weigh evidence carefully and one should not make light of the difficulties they face. On the one hand, Harry Stanley was walking down the road, carrying a table leg in a plastic bag, when he was shot dead. On the other hand, the people who shot him were policemen. Hence, the internal investigation was initially headed by a Surrey officer who is himself facing disciplinary charges in relation to a shooting incident.</p> <p>You may say that everybody makes mistakes. We have come to accept that police officers fail to investigate crimes, frame people and suppress the enjoyment of cannabis. But when they kill us, I think we are entitled to ask what we are paying them for.</p> <p>Everybody does make mistakes. Whoever phoned the police that day made two: one relating to Harry's accent, and another in imagining a table leg was a sawn-off shotgun. The first need not necessarily have mattered. An accent is no use in identifying a man walking down the street. Some of the press have suggested that the mistaken belief that Harry was Irish justified the shooting, ignoring the fact that being Irish is not actually proof of anything. It certainly wouldn't shed any light on whether a plastic bag might have a shotgun in it.</p> <p>Paramilitary organisations are apt to be secretive. Otherwise, Cyril Ramaphosa and Marti Artisarii would not need to be driven blindfold around the Irish countryside examining arms dumps. They could just pop in and out of bars looking in people's bags to see whether their guns had been fired lately. And sawn-off shotguns are not used in paramilitary operations anyway.</p> <p>The suspicion that a man is carrying a gun, however, is something to take seriously. In fact, before challenging a potentially armed suspect, officers are supposed to take cover. It is no part of their guidelines to simply walk behind a gunman and shout: \"Police!\"</p> <p>As it was, Harry Stanley had no reason to know anyone was shouting at him and perhaps didn't hear, so kept walking. The officers shouted again and he turned, probably quite curious. His turning was sufficient provocation for the officers to open fire. Perhaps the public should be trained in how we must react to shouting police if we don't want to die.</p> <p>We are used to people in possession of toy guns being shot, despite the fact that the police are supposed to try not to shoot even those people whom they know for certain are genuinely armed. Harry Stanley was carrying a bag with a table leg in it. I would have thought that it should have crossed someone's mind that it might not be a sawn-off shotgun. The witness who got so carried away had an excuse: a car chase involving armed police had by chance ended outside the pub that day, and doubtless imaginations were racing in what was after all a licensed premises. All the more reason why officers should have been sceptical.</p> <p>But perhaps the police themselves were a bit fired-up too. On Monday, Glen Smyth of the Police Federation described facing an armed suspect as \"exciting\"; and that was an attempt to defend this shooting.</p> <p>Maybe the killers of Harry Stanley will describe the excitement when they give evidence at the inquest, although they won't have to say anything that might incriminate them, and they will be hidden by screens, to protect them from table legs.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "After last week's column, I wouldn't want readers to glean the impression that only black or Irish people die at the hands of agents of the state. Harry Stanley was a white Scotsman, who popped into a Hackney pub for a quick soft drink, and minutes later was gunned down by armed police. It has to be said, however, that whoever phoned 999 to report a suspicious looking man in the pub, described him as having an Irish accent. In future, East End villains will be able to save a fortune on their hit-man bills. They'll simply report a person as being Irish and the police will do it for them. And what better way to deal with nuisance neighbours? The Crown Prosecution Service announced on Monday that no officers in this case are to be charged. One might take the words \"insufficient evidence\" seriously were it not for the fact that the crown has for years ushered legions of innocent people into jail on the flimsiest of evidence and then fought tooth and nail to keep them there. I'm sure if that, if the Metropolitan Police had decided to fit Harry Stanley up with something instead of shooting him in the head, the CPS would have done everything possible to assist them. However, crown prosecutors must weigh evidence carefully and one should not make light of the difficulties they face. On the one hand, Harry Stanley was walking down the road, carrying a table leg in a plastic bag, when he was shot dead. On the other hand, the people who shot him were policemen. Hence, the internal investigation was initially headed by a Surrey officer who is himself facing disciplinary charges in relation to a shooting incident. You may say that everybody makes mistakes. We have come to accept that police officers fail to investigate crimes, frame people and suppress the enjoyment of cannabis. But when they kill us, I think we are entitled to ask what we are paying them for. Everybody does make mistakes. Whoever phoned the police that day made two: one relating to Harry's accent, and another in imagining a table leg was a sawn-off shotgun. The first need not necessarily have mattered. An accent is no use in identifying a man walking down the street. Some of the press have suggested that the mistaken belief that Harry was Irish justified the shooting, ignoring the fact that being Irish is not actually proof of anything. It certainly wouldn't shed any light on whether a plastic bag might have a shotgun in it. Paramilitary organisations are apt to be secretive. Otherwise, Cyril Ramaphosa and Marti Artisarii would not need to be driven blindfold around the Irish countryside examining arms dumps. They could just pop in and out of bars looking in people's bags to see whether their guns had been fired lately. And sawn-off shotguns are not used in paramilitary operations anyway. The suspicion that a man is carrying a gun, however, is something to take seriously. In fact, before challenging a potentially armed suspect, officers are supposed to take cover. It is no part of their guidelines to simply walk behind a gunman and shout: \"Police!\" As it was, Harry Stanley had no reason to know anyone was shouting at him and perhaps didn't hear, so kept walking. The officers shouted again and he turned, probably quite curious. His turning was sufficient provocation for the officers to open fire. Perhaps the public should be trained in how we must react to shouting police if we don't want to die. We are used to people in possession of toy guns being shot, despite the fact that the police are supposed to try not to shoot even those people whom they know for certain are genuinely armed. Harry Stanley was carrying a bag with a table leg in it. I would have thought that it should have crossed someone's mind that it might not be a sawn-off shotgun. The witness who got so carried away had an excuse: a car chase involving armed police had by chance ended outside the pub that day, and doubtless imaginations were racing in what was after all a licensed premises. All the more reason why officers should have been sceptical. But perhaps the police themselves were a bit fired-up too. On Monday, Glen Smyth of the Police Federation described facing an armed suspect as \"exciting\"; and that was an attempt to defend this shooting. Maybe the killers of Harry Stanley will describe the excitement when they give evidence at the inquest, although they won't have to say anything that might incriminate them, and they will be hidden by screens, to protect them from table legs. comment@theguardian.com",

Father David Martin, who died of bronchopneumonia at a London hospital at the age of 44 in September 1998, had been acting chaplain one day a week at the Oratory School in west London, where the prime minister's sons, Euan and Nicholas, are now pupils. Last night a spokesman for the church admitted that successive heads of Father Martin's religious order, the Oratory Fathers, had known that he was HIV positive several years before he was ordained in 1994. It was not known whether they passed that information to the school before he started work there in 1997. Claims about his conduct surfaced in a letter to Hammersmith and Fulham social services department last week. Earlier letters making less specific allegations were sent to leading figures in the church including the Archbishop of Westminster, Cormac Murphy O'Connor and to national newspapers in late October and were also referred to Hammersmith and Fulham. A spokesman for the Westminster diocese said: \"Naturally the church is deeply concerned whenever any allegations are made against a priest and especially if there are any victims of abuse. Any allegations need to be fully investigated and the church authorities will cooperate fully.\" In a terse statement, Father Ignatius Harrison, provost of the Oratory Fathers, of which Father Martin had been a member, said only that the order was fully aware of the investigation. He later added that there had never been any concerns about Father Martin's behaviour. Father Michael Napier, the provost of the order at the time Father Martin joined in 1988 and at the time of his ordination in 1994, is now also dead. Church sources said that Martin had been diagnosed HIV positive in 1991 - and had confided in Father Napier. The information was subsequently given to Father Harrison when he succeeded as provost in 1996. The church was unable to say whether the school had carried out its own checks when he was recommended to them by the order as a governor and chaplain. Father Martin continued to visit the school until July 1998. Child protection officers were yesterday attempting to establish the identity of the boy who made the complaints. They have only a first name to go on. \"There was a child protection meeting six weeks ago but they considered that there was no evidence with which to base any further investigations, because the letter was anonymous, there was no specific allegation of child abuse, and obviously Father Martin was dead,\" said a spokeswoman for Hammersmith and Fulham. The latest letter alleging child abuse came from a boy claiming to be at the school. The allegation is that abuse of one boy took place away from the school and unconnected with school activities, but relating to the priest's church work. On Monday social services and the police held a meeting and decided to launch an investigation. The council's child protection team met officers yesterday. They are looking again at the earlier letters. ChildLine founder and chairman Esther Rantzen confirmed that the telephone helpline had been contacted by children making allegations of abuse at the school. The inquiry is hampered by the unclear lines of responsibility. Father Martin was chaplain at the school for four terms but was employed not by them but by the Oratory Fathers. Father Martin attended the school weekly, mainly to prepare boys for confirmation. He had previously been director of music at the Brompton Oratory and was instrumental in setting up a choir school there. Father Martin graduated from St Andrews university in 1976. He entered the priesthood as a novice in 1988. A statement released on behalf of the priest's father, James Martin, from Ayr, said: \"We are devastated by news of this. It has come as a complete shock to us all.\" Priests in the dock 1996 Father Adrian McLeish of Durham sentenced to six years for abusing boys aged 10 to 18 and exchanging internet pornography. 1997 Father Michael Walsh jailed for five years for indecent assault and gross indecency over a 19 year period. It emerged that Archbishop Cormac Murphy O'Connor appointed Hill to a succession of posts despite allegations that he was a paedophile. The archbishop has apologised. 1998 Father Eric Taylor jailed for seven years for abusing boys in his care at the Father Hudson Society's home in Warwickshire between 1957 and 1965. 2000 Father Joe Jordan jailed for eight years for sexually abusing boys. He was ordained by the Archbishop of Wales, John Ward, in 1996 despite warnings that he was a potential abuser who had earlier been banned from teaching. In 1998 Archbishop Ward's press officer John Lloyd was also jailed for eight years for indecent assaults on children. The archbishop has refused to resign.",

About 25 priests out of 5,600 have been convicted in the past five years and the cases keep on coming - an average of one every three months. Archbishop Cormac Murphy O'Connor, head of the Roman Catholic church in England and Wales, who was criticised in the summer after he admitted reappointing a priest accused of sex abuse to a new post in his former diocese of Brighton and Arundel, said recently: \"I think the paedophile scandals have indeed done damage to the church. \"The vast majority of priests who are good and faithful feel ashamed.\" With its moral authoritarianism, the church makes a good target for accusations of hypocrisy.

Whether an institutional environment attracts a certain sort of personality is hard to say.\" What is certain is that the church has been slow to take allegations seriously and has been perceived to be more concerned about protecting its priests rather than their victims. It introduced guidelines for the priesthood in 1994 - the year Father David Martin was ordained - but the case of Father Joe Jordan, jailed in Cardiff last month two years after his ordination following convictions for sexually abusing boys, shows they have not always been followed. The church authorities in September brought in the former public standards watchdog Lord Nolan to inquire into the working of the guidelines in the hope of heading off accusations of complacency.

      "bodyText": "With rail travel in chaos many companies have still not provided timetables for the Christmas period. With under three weeks to go until Christmas the Guardian tried to book five possible train journeys, calling the 0345 passenger inquiry line to find out times of trains. Some operators refused to give out details saying the information would be a \"waste of time\" as they were still waiting for the timetables. Others tried to be helpful but said the information was liable to be inaccurate and advised customers to call nearer Christmas to check. Operators sounded stressed as they tried to field inquiries without up-to-date train information. One said: \"We have been getting some abuse from angry customers who are trying to plan their Christmas. We accept it is very frustrating for them as they have already faced long delays and now can't even get accurate information about Christmas train times\". The Guardian attempted to book outward trains on December 22 and returning on Boxing Day. Journey 1. Manchester to Penzance We succeeded in booking an 11.03am Manchester Piccadilly train to Penzance on December 22 but had no luck with a return journey on Boxing Day as no timetable information is available yet. \"We only have Virgin Train times for December 22 and nothing later.\" Because of the speed restrictions train companies are reluctant to bring out the Christmas timetable till the last minute because the information could change. \"It is supposed to be running but the Boxing Day connection from Birmingham has not been confirmed yet\". Journey 2. Nottingham to Plymouth We managed to book a Nottingham to Plymouth train on December 22 but again no information on Boxing Day services. \"We have still not got the timetable in place and are hoping it will arrive on Saturday.\" Journey 3. Ipswich to Edinburgh We could get to Edinburgh on December 22 but no Boxing Day train back to Ipswich. But we were warned to double check timetables nearer departure as more accurate information becomes available. We were warned the train could be cancelled or altered. \"We can get you to Edinburgh but there are no trains back to Ipswich from there on Boxing Day. We can only give you provisional times on the way out. You will have to double check later.\" Journey 4. Oxford to Newcastle We were unable to book as no information was available about Christmas timetables. \"Great North Eastern Railways have not yet given us the timetable so we can't give you any train times.\" When told other operators had been more helpful, they replied they should not have even provided provisional train times until they receive the Christmas timetable. \"Trains running on December 22 are changing all the time.

      "body": "<p>Germany's most celebrated inter-racial marriage is on the rocks. The former tennis ace Boris Becker announced yesterday that he and his black wife, Barbara Feltus, had split up.</p> <p>Their seven-year marriage acquired huge significance as a symbol of Germany's evolution into a multi-ethnic society. Earlier this year Mr Becker was among the first recruits to a government-sponsored campaign urging the public to stand up to racism.</p> <p>In a statement Mr Becker ruled out a divorce, but said: \"Our views on the priorities of our relationship are too far apart. We have recognised that we cannot go on in this way.\"</p> <p>The break-up poses a problem for Coca-Cola: Ms Feltus revealed at the weekend that she had made a television commercial for the company.</p> <p>A spokeswoman said the advert was due to go out in February, but added: \"How far the latest news might influence our decisions in the future is still being discussed internally\".</p> <p>The news that the sporting idol was to marry an unknown black actress and model astonished many Germans.</p> <p>\"Barbara is black and beautiful and I am supposed to be the typical German - blond and blue-eyed,\" Mr Becker said later. \"When we got engaged, we received threats.\"</p> <p>Throughout their marriage, the couple complained repeatedly of racial discrimination.</p> <p>\"Sometimes ... I am someone who cannot get served because I'm black. The next minute I'm Frau Becker and treated like a queen. Sometimes I find both awful,\" Ms Feltus once said.</p> <p>Though they did not meet until 1991, Mr Becker and his wife grew up within a short distance of each other, near Heidelberg in southern Germany. Ms Feltus has a German mother and an African-American father.</p> <p>She and Mr Becker have two sons, Noah, six, and Elias, who was born last year.</p> <p>In 1996 Mr Becker said he wanted Noah to go to school in the US so that he could grow up in a more ethnically diverse society. But despite rumours that they were about to go abroad, they settled in Munich. Mr Becker said last year: \"The public have accepted us.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Germany's most celebrated inter-racial marriage is on the rocks. The former tennis ace Boris Becker announced yesterday that he and his black wife, Barbara Feltus, had split up. Their seven-year marriage acquired huge significance as a symbol of Germany's evolution into a multi-ethnic society. Earlier this year Mr Becker was among the first recruits to a government-sponsored campaign urging the public to stand up to racism. In a statement Mr Becker ruled out a divorce, but said: \"Our views on the priorities of our relationship are too far apart. We have recognised that we cannot go on in this way.\" The break-up poses a problem for Coca-Cola: Ms Feltus revealed at the weekend that she had made a television commercial for the company. A spokeswoman said the advert was due to go out in February, but added: \"How far the latest news might influence our decisions in the future is still being discussed internally\". The news that the sporting idol was to marry an unknown black actress and model astonished many Germans. \"Barbara is black and beautiful and I am supposed to be the typical German - blond and blue-eyed,\" Mr Becker said later. \"When we got engaged, we received threats.\" Throughout their marriage, the couple complained repeatedly of racial discrimination. \"Sometimes ... I am someone who cannot get served because I'm black. The next minute I'm Frau Becker and treated like a queen. Sometimes I find both awful,\" Ms Feltus once said. Though they did not meet until 1991, Mr Becker and his wife grew up within a short distance of each other, near Heidelberg in southern Germany. Ms Feltus has a German mother and an African-American father. She and Mr Becker have two sons, Noah, six, and Elias, who was born last year. In 1996 Mr Becker said he wanted Noah to go to school in the US so that he could grow up in a more ethnically diverse society. But despite rumours that they were about to go abroad, they settled in Munich. Mr Becker said last year: \"The public have accepted us.\"",

      "byline": "Mike Selvey",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Colin Cowdrey, the former Kent and England batsman, who has died aged 67, was the first cricketer to gain 100 Test caps, and one of the game's enigmas. A right-hander of an elegance matched only by Tom Graveney among his contemporaries, and courageous as they come, he made 42,719 first-class runs, 7,624 of them in 114 Tests at an average of 44.06, with 22 of his 107 centuries coming in them. He made a thousand runs in a season 27 times, a tally surpassed only by WG Grace and Frank Woolley. </p> <p>He was adept on front or back foot, easing the ball to the boundary rather than belting it - \"hard enough for four is hard enough\", he would say. He could swivel to pull the fastest bowlers, and developed a paddle sweep from an upright stance to fine leg off the spinners. His comfortable bulk belied an agility that made him a top-class slip fielder, and his 120 catches, a world Test record at the time, has been exceeded since by only five other cricketers, none of them English. </p> <p>As well as leading Kent from 1957 to 1971, Cowdrey also captained England on 27 occasions, but in five stints, having had trouble convincing the selectors that he had the necessary steel or drive and dynamism for the job. It was said that he was too sensitive - and too fond of cricketers to want to upset them with uncomfortable decisions - and, at various stages, he lost the captaincy to Peter May, Ted Dexter, Brian Close, and Raymond Illingworth, each of whom had no such inhibitions. </p> <p>To Cowdrey's immense disappointment, not one of his six Ashes tours was as captain, and he thought long and hard before accepting the vice-captaincy under Illingworth in 1971-72, a trip on which he failed to do himself justice. He was awarded the CBE in 1972, knighted 20 years on and elevated to the peerage, as Baron Cowdrey of Tonbridge, in 1997. </p> <p>Cowdrey was a complex character given to passages where his play reached sublime levels, but then subject to such bemusing introspection that ordinary journeymen county bowlers could be made to seem world-beaters. At his best, the fastest bowlers could be caressed around the field as if medium pace; at his most reflective, when he scratched around for no reward, he was infuriating to those who recognised a supreme talent. The game was either incredibly simple or bafflingly complex, depending on his mood. </p> <p>He was not universally popular within the game, despite a beaming benevolent exterior, innate kindliness and chivalry towards his opponents, and he had his enemies. Many mistrusted him, for example, for his ethics of \"walking\" for obvious decisions, and then not doing so for the less obvious, in the hope that his reputation would fool the umpire, although he was by no means alone in this gamesmanship. </p> <p>Perhaps any antipathy had something to do with the fact that Cowdrey - Tonbridge school and Brasenose College, Oxford - had been an amateur playing in an increasingly professional game, turning up for matches in his Jaguar - registration MCC 307 to mark his initials and highest score - already changed in his pristine tailored flannels and blazer, and departing at close of play likewise. Maybe, as well, they resented the notion that his crust did not depend on his success at the crease, and so he could afford to be less pragmatic than them. It is hard to get close to players in those circumstances. </p> <p>Later in life, his connection with cricket continued, at first as president of the MCC during the club's bicentenary in 1987, and then as president of the International Cricket Council, potentially the most powerful administrative position in the sport, during which time he introduced an international code of conduct and match referees to help clean up the tarnished image of the game, and oversaw the reintroduction of South Africa to international cricket. </p> <p>He was, however, regarded as indecisive and malleable, and was pressurised into allowing the decision to hold the 1996 World Cup in England to be overturned. It went to the sub-continent. </p> <p>Born in Putumala, India, it seemed that Cowdrey was destined for the game from the moment that his cricket-mad father, a tea planter in Bangalore, gave him the initials MCC. He was regarded as an infant prodigy; his enthusiasm was said to have been fuelled by a letter he received from Jack Hobbs as a seven-year-old after winning a bat for scoring 93 in an inter-school match. </p> <p>He went on to become an outstanding schools player, having been introduced to the Tonbridge first XI at the age of 13, primarily as a legspinner but working his way up to No 3 batsman. He was the youngest schoolboy to appear in a match at Lord's, when he made 75 and 44 and took eight wickets, and actually played for Kent while still at school, becoming their youngest ever capped player at 18. </p> <p>Cowdrey might well have played for England while still at Oxford, but, at the age of 21, he found himself on the boat to Australia with Len Hutton's Ashes-winning side of 1954-55. His third Test, over new year and in front of 63,000 spectators in the vast Melbourne cricket ground, brought his first, and, many argue, his finest Test hundred - 102 made out of a total of 191, an innings on an unreliable pitch, which rescued England from a Lindwall-Miller induced 41 for four, and set the ground for Frank Tyson to blast his side to victory. Later in the tour, he made a century in each innings against New South Wales. </p> <p>Two years on, Cowdrey and Peter May compiled what was then the highest partnership for any wicket in Tests, and which remains the highest for the fourth wicket, when they added 411 together against West Indies at Edgbaston, Cowdrey devising his own method of frustrating the mysterious West Indian spinner, Sonny Ramadhin, by judicious use of the front pad as a second, and frequently first, line of defence. </p> <p>May made 285 not out and Cowdrey 154, the first time he had made a Test hundred through occupation rather than strokeplay, and together they ensured that Ramadhin, who had shouted himself hoarse appealing to no avail for lbw against Cowdrey, was never the same force again. </p> <p>In 1963, as the Lord's Test against West Indies headed towards a thrilling climax, Cowdrey contributed one of the game's most dramatic moments. In the second innings, he had had his left wrist fractured by a rising ball from Wes Hall, and now, with just two balls of the match remaining, six runs needed and no further wickets in hand other than his, he reappeared, beaming, down the steps, arm in plaster, ready to face, if necessary, the final ball. His fortitude was not tested, and the match was drawn. </p> <p>Early in 1968, he led England to victory in the series in the Caribbean, the last time an England captain has done so. The clinching match came in the fourth Test in Trinidad after three mundane draws. His go-slow tactics so infuriated the West Indies captain, Garfield Sobers, that he declared with a meagre lead and time in hand, allowing England to win the match, and ultimately the series. </p> <p>But even then it took some gentle, last-ditch persuasion from Graveney and John Edrich before Cowdrey agreed the run chase should be attempted. Typically, having been convinced of the viability, his calm, controlled 71 helped win the day. Sobers has never been forgiven his indiscretion, and his effigy was burnt throughout the Caribbean. </p> <p>In 1974, at the age of 41, Cowdrey enjoyed a fine season, and might have expected to tour Australia for a seventh time that winter. However, although omitted from Mike Denness's party, he received an emergency call from a side that was in the process of being worked over on fast uncompromising pitches by Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. </p> <p>Five days after arriving in Perth, and three years since he had last played a Test, he was facing the duo on the fastest pitch in the world - and acquitting himself courageously with scores of 22 and 41, giving an astounding display of defensive batting against high pace. It was to be his last series. </p> <p> The following season was to be his final one with Kent, and, six months after the battering in Australia, he marked it in the finest style by scoring 151 not out at Canterbury, as the county successfully chased 354 to beat the Australians by four wickets. It was his last century, and the grandest of hurrahs on the ground he cherished. </p> <p>Cowdrey's private life was not without controversy. In 1956, he married Penny Chiesman, whose family were wealthy store-owners in Kent, and together they had three sons and a daughter. Two of the sons, Chris and Graham, went on to play for Kent; Chris also saw six Tests for England, five during David Gower's successful tour of India in 1984-85, and one, against West Indies at Headingley in 1988, as captain. When Chris took his first Test wicket, Cowdrey senior, listening in his car, marked the occasion by driving in astonishment the wrong way up a one-way street and receiving a caution. </p> <p>That same year, he divorced Penny and married one of the daughters of the Duke of Norfolk, Lady Herries of Terregles. The family lived at Angmering Park, Littlehampton, where Cowdrey died; he had suffered a stroke in July. His wife survives him, as do his children. </p> <p> Michael Colin Cowdrey, Lord Cowdrey of Tonbridge, cricketer, born December 24 1932; died December 5 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Colin Cowdrey, the former Kent and England batsman, who has died aged 67, was the first cricketer to gain 100 Test caps, and one of the game's enigmas. A right-hander of an elegance matched only by Tom Graveney among his contemporaries, and courageous as they come, he made 42,719 first-class runs, 7,624 of them in 114 Tests at an average of 44.06, with 22 of his 107 centuries coming in them. He made a thousand runs in a season 27 times, a tally surpassed only by WG Grace and Frank Woolley. He was adept on front or back foot, easing the ball to the boundary rather than belting it - \"hard enough for four is hard enough\", he would say. He could swivel to pull the fastest bowlers, and developed a paddle sweep from an upright stance to fine leg off the spinners. His comfortable bulk belied an agility that made him a top-class slip fielder, and his 120 catches, a world Test record at the time, has been exceeded since by only five other cricketers, none of them English. As well as leading Kent from 1957 to 1971, Cowdrey also captained England on 27 occasions, but in five stints, having had trouble convincing the selectors that he had the necessary steel or drive and dynamism for the job. It was said that he was too sensitive - and too fond of cricketers to want to upset them with uncomfortable decisions - and, at various stages, he lost the captaincy to Peter May, Ted Dexter, Brian Close, and Raymond Illingworth, each of whom had no such inhibitions. To Cowdrey's immense disappointment, not one of his six Ashes tours was as captain, and he thought long and hard before accepting the vice-captaincy under Illingworth in 1971-72, a trip on which he failed to do himself justice. He was awarded the CBE in 1972, knighted 20 years on and elevated to the peerage, as Baron Cowdrey of Tonbridge, in 1997. Cowdrey was a complex character given to passages where his play reached sublime levels, but then subject to such bemusing introspection that ordinary journeymen county bowlers could be made to seem world-beaters. At his best, the fastest bowlers could be caressed around the field as if medium pace; at his most reflective, when he scratched around for no reward, he was infuriating to those who recognised a supreme talent. The game was either incredibly simple or bafflingly complex, depending on his mood. He was not universally popular within the game, despite a beaming benevolent exterior, innate kindliness and chivalry towards his opponents, and he had his enemies. Many mistrusted him, for example, for his ethics of \"walking\" for obvious decisions, and then not doing so for the less obvious, in the hope that his reputation would fool the umpire, although he was by no means alone in this gamesmanship. Perhaps any antipathy had something to do with the fact that Cowdrey - Tonbridge school and Brasenose College, Oxford - had been an amateur playing in an increasingly professional game, turning up for matches in his Jaguar - registration MCC 307 to mark his initials and highest score - already changed in his pristine tailored flannels and blazer, and departing at close of play likewise. Maybe, as well, they resented the notion that his crust did not depend on his success at the crease, and so he could afford to be less pragmatic than them. It is hard to get close to players in those circumstances. Later in life, his connection with cricket continued, at first as president of the MCC during the club's bicentenary in 1987, and then as president of the International Cricket Council, potentially the most powerful administrative position in the sport, during which time he introduced an international code of conduct and match referees to help clean up the tarnished image of the game, and oversaw the reintroduction of South Africa to international cricket. He was, however, regarded as indecisive and malleable, and was pressurised into allowing the decision to hold the 1996 World Cup in England to be overturned. It went to the sub-continent. Born in Putumala, India, it seemed that Cowdrey was destined for the game from the moment that his cricket-mad father, a tea planter in Bangalore, gave him the initials MCC. He was regarded as an infant prodigy; his enthusiasm was said to have been fuelled by a letter he received from Jack Hobbs as a seven-year-old after winning a bat for scoring 93 in an inter-school match. He went on to become an outstanding schools player, having been introduced to the Tonbridge first XI at the age of 13, primarily as a legspinner but working his way up to No 3 batsman. He was the youngest schoolboy to appear in a match at Lord's, when he made 75 and 44 and took eight wickets, and actually played for Kent while still at school, becoming their youngest ever capped player at 18. Cowdrey might well have played for England while still at Oxford, but, at the age of 21, he found himself on the boat to Australia with Len Hutton's Ashes-winning side of 1954-55. His third Test, over new year and in front of 63,000 spectators in the vast Melbourne cricket ground, brought his first, and, many argue, his finest Test hundred - 102 made out of a total of 191, an innings on an unreliable pitch, which rescued England from a Lindwall-Miller induced 41 for four, and set the ground for Frank Tyson to blast his side to victory. Later in the tour, he made a century in each innings against New South Wales. Two years on, Cowdrey and Peter May compiled what was then the highest partnership for any wicket in Tests, and which remains the highest for the fourth wicket, when they added 411 together against West Indies at Edgbaston, Cowdrey devising his own method of frustrating the mysterious West Indian spinner, Sonny Ramadhin, by judicious use of the front pad as a second, and frequently first, line of defence. May made 285 not out and Cowdrey 154, the first time he had made a Test hundred through occupation rather than strokeplay, and together they ensured that Ramadhin, who had shouted himself hoarse appealing to no avail for lbw against Cowdrey, was never the same force again. In 1963, as the Lord's Test against West Indies headed towards a thrilling climax, Cowdrey contributed one of the game's most dramatic moments. In the second innings, he had had his left wrist fractured by a rising ball from Wes Hall, and now, with just two balls of the match remaining, six runs needed and no further wickets in hand other than his, he reappeared, beaming, down the steps, arm in plaster, ready to face, if necessary, the final ball. His fortitude was not tested, and the match was drawn. Early in 1968, he led England to victory in the series in the Caribbean, the last time an England captain has done so. The clinching match came in the fourth Test in Trinidad after three mundane draws. His go-slow tactics so infuriated the West Indies captain, Garfield Sobers, that he declared with a meagre lead and time in hand, allowing England to win the match, and ultimately the series. But even then it took some gentle, last-ditch persuasion from Graveney and John Edrich before Cowdrey agreed the run chase should be attempted. Typically, having been convinced of the viability, his calm, controlled 71 helped win the day. Sobers has never been forgiven his indiscretion, and his effigy was burnt throughout the Caribbean. In 1974, at the age of 41, Cowdrey enjoyed a fine season, and might have expected to tour Australia for a seventh time that winter. However, although omitted from Mike Denness's party, he received an emergency call from a side that was in the process of being worked over on fast uncompromising pitches by Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. Five days after arriving in Perth, and three years since he had last played a Test, he was facing the duo on the fastest pitch in the world - and acquitting himself courageously with scores of 22 and 41, giving an astounding display of defensive batting against high pace. It was to be his last series. The following season was to be his final one with Kent, and, six months after the battering in Australia, he marked it in the finest style by scoring 151 not out at Canterbury, as the county successfully chased 354 to beat the Australians by four wickets. It was his last century, and the grandest of hurrahs on the ground he cherished. Cowdrey's private life was not without controversy. In 1956, he married Penny Chiesman, whose family were wealthy store-owners in Kent, and together they had three sons and a daughter. Two of the sons, Chris and Graham, went on to play for Kent; Chris also saw six Tests for England, five during David Gower's successful tour of India in 1984-85, and one, against West Indies at Headingley in 1988, as captain. When Chris took his first Test wicket, Cowdrey senior, listening in his car, marked the occasion by driving in astonishment the wrong way up a one-way street and receiving a caution. That same year, he divorced Penny and married one of the daughters of the Duke of Norfolk, Lady Herries of Terregles. The family lived at Angmering Park, Littlehampton, where Cowdrey died; he had suffered a stroke in July. His wife survives him, as do his children.

I have no garden and live in a polluted area, so this is a wonderful chance to be in the countryside, to try to improve our environment - and volunteering is very much part of my culture.\" But for most, the idea of volunteering isn't a primary reason for getting involved. \"You may say we are volunteers, and I agree that it is good to put something back,\" says Fred Anafchi, 22, from Iran. \"But it is also a lovely day out, it is free and, for us, who can never get out of the city, this is fresh air and peacefulness. In return, we plant trees.\" Nature's comforts Nigel, 17, has lived alone in Glasgow since fleeing Somalia following the murder of his father and death threats to him and his mother. He is studying for Highers and hopes to go on to do aeronautical engineering at university. He is a fluent English speaker since this was the common language between his Somalian mother and Brazilian father. \"My father was mayor of Mogadishu and was murdered on February 14 this year,\" he says. \"My mother was pregnant with my only sibling at the time and she fled elsewhere in Africa, I have no idea where, but the Red Cross is helping me to trace her. I left shortly after her, hiding in a cargo plane. \"In Glasgow, I am alone, but I can look after myself. The difficulty is that it's hard to get out of the city. Like most refugees, I've less than \u00a310 a week in cash. I love being in the countryside. You need that time; it helps you to understand your new life, get to know the place and the people, and also it's a comfort to feel that the cycle of nature continues even when people's lives are over. \"To me that is so important. I needed it in Somalia and I need it even more here.\"",

      "body": "<p>Five-year old Shannon is still having nightmares and cries a lot. She was rescued by lifeboat out of her first-floor flat window, with 15 feet of water swirling menacingly beneath. Now she won't take a bath or go swimming, and doesn't want to go to school. As with many other children at her school in Lewes, east Sussex, the recent floods have left her anxious and withdrawn. </p> <p>Unlike in countries such as Bangladesh or Mozambique, severe flooding causes few physical health risks in industrialised nations. The residents of Lewes or York are unlikely to go down with dysentry or cholera. </p> <p>However, up to 20% of natural disaster victims may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Many will feel depressed and isolated, losing their sense of place and attachment, or developing obsessive anxieties as a result of their ordeal. The British Medical Journal has recently highlighted that the psychological costs of climate change are likely to be considerable. </p> <p>\"Shannon needs help,\" says her mother, Irene Hoad. And so does Irene. A young, single parent, she relied heavily on the network of neighbours in her block. Now all the ground-floor tenants have gone, decanted from their sodden, ruined homes into temporary accommodation. The council says it will take until next summer to make their homes habitable. Most will not be coming back. </p> <p>Four hundred families were made homeless by the Lewes floods. A third of them had no insurance or were underinsured. According to the Association of British Insurers (ABI) an estimated six million homeowners do not have contents cover. Some are living out of mobile homes in their gardens. Many more are in caravans, B&amp;Bs and rented accommodation all over the district. And some, the council frankly admits, it doesn't have a clue about. With families displaced and split up, and anxieties about insurance mounting by the day, the floods are taking a huge emotional toll. </p> <p>The good news is that increased social support, along with practical help, can significantly mitigate the less quantifiable psychological effects. By and large, though, this is being left up to voluntary agencies and community-minded individuals to provide. </p> <p>In Lewes, it's the volunteer bureau - run on a shoestring and under threat of closure - that's helping the uninsured to clear out their homes, get together some clothes and furniture, and start rebuilding their lives. A charitable \"hardship\" fund has also been set up to distribute to residents who have suffered distress. To date, more than \u00a3140,000 has been raised - much of it from members of the public. </p> <p>Mind, Age Concern and East Sussex Disability Association are among the voluntary groups which have set up a flood aftercare group with social services funding. More than 100 calls to the helpline range from people desperate to find a dehumidifier, to parents of children with drowned pets, to those - often with previous psychological problems - who have been deeply disturbed by the recent events. Many just want to talk. The more severely affected are being offered counselling and other specialist services. </p> <p>It's not just the flood victims who need support. There's the bin man who broke down in tears after clearing out countless contaminated homes; the firefighter racked with guilt because he was out helping others when his own family's home was flooded; the care staff dealing with loss and trauma at emergency centres. Many of these workers need a chance to unburden their own feelings. </p> <p>\"The full impact of these floods is unlikely to be felt for some time,\" says Phil Dodgson, head of adult psychology services at South Downs health trust, Sussex. \"Many people will be experiencing anger, guilt and feelings of dread. Some, the ones having persistent flash-backs or feeling very depressed and confused, will need help to reprocess their feelings.\" </p> <p>The psychological effect of severe flooding, as compared with a train crash or other major trauma, should not be underestimated, he says. The speed and force with which the water has risen, smashing down doors and sending furniture crashing against walls, has thrown whole communities into a state of shock. </p> <p>The most vulnerable people at a time like this are the young, old, disabled and mentally ill. In Crawley, West Sussex, 42 frail, elderly residents of a care home had to be evacuated in the early hours because the ground floor was under water. They left without anything, in their nightclothes, and ended up dispersed all over the county to residential homes as far away as Worthing. With few vacancies nearby, and their care home badly damaged, instant decisions had to be made about whether these transfers would be short-term or long-term. \"The psychological effect on these residents can only be imagined,\" says local operations manager, Pat Howe. </p> <p>In York, too, emergency decisions had to be made about evacuating elderly people when the River Ouse burst its banks. In one case, the community services director, Jim Crook, opted for sandbagging a care home which has very dependent residents, rather than risk moving them. Fortunately, the gamble paid off. </p> <p>In another instance, there was no choice. Thirty-five older residents had to be moved out of their riverside sheltered homes, and into temporary accommodation, after the floods took out a local power station. York's joint social services and housing department was able to do this relatively efficiently, Crook says, and to help the emergency services identify the most vulnerable people thoughout the worst of the flooding. </p> <p>For Peter Smurthwaite, who is severely visually impaired, the floods brought not just shock, trauma and the loss of his Lewes home, but also endless battles with his insurers over whether he can stay in a town where he knows his way around, or whether he must move to cheaper temporary accommodation miles away. </p> <p>East Sussex social services, like many around the country, has been hard-pressed to make even these imperfect arrangements. \"Because of the pressures on our community care budget, there's a lot less in-house provision,\" says Phil Gander, head of mental health services. \"We can't find money to ease bed-blocking, let alone provide an emergency infrastructure for evacuees.\" </p> <p>It was the aftercare group, run by Mind and other voluntary groups, that laid on a creche for flood-hit families, and which is starting up counselling sessions in Shannon's school. Irene hopes they will help. Sitting in her sunny living room, on a crisp cold morning, it's hard to imagine the day, just a few weeks ago, when the water came from nowhere, turning the road outside into a torrent. But it was real enough, and there have been several flood warnings since. </p> <p>Shannon keeps saying: \"Mummy, it's happening again.\" Irene and her neighbours try to brush her worries aside. They're concentrating instead on giving her a really good Christmas. </p> <p><strong>Counting the cost</strong><br>Alison Benjamin</p> <p>The Association of British Insurers estimates that the floods may have caused up to \u00a3500m of damage. East Sussex county council and Lewes district council estimate that the cost to them is in the region of \u00a37m. Of this, \u00a3150,000 covers the cost of short-term care packages, extra staffing and the flood aftercare group. Other councils are still counting the initial costs. Damages to bridges and roads may not be fully known until water levels have dropped considerably. </p> <p>The Bellwin scheme allows councils, in theory, to claim back spending on emergencies from central government above a threshold. Currently councils have to put aside 0.2% of their budgets for emergency expenditure. A claim for any additional costs is then lodged with the government. Following the floods, deputy prime minister, John Prescott, pledged to increase the percentage the government covers from 85% to 100% of a claim. </p> <p>However, East Sussex has already had the majority of its claim rejected. Council leader David Rodgers says: \"We have been disappointed by the response of government to our application. It has confirmed what we thought about the scheme: it does not cover the costs of this type of disaster.\" </p> <p>This was one of the topics on the agenda at yesterday's central-local partnership, a forum chaired by Prescott where issues affecting local government are discussed. The Local Government Association fed in the main concerns from local authorities around the country - not least, who will foot the \u00a31.2bn bill for increased flood defences. The government has agreed to look at the whole funding mechanism.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Five-year old Shannon is still having nightmares and cries a lot. She was rescued by lifeboat out of her first-floor flat window, with 15 feet of water swirling menacingly beneath. Now she won't take a bath or go swimming, and doesn't want to go to school. As with many other children at her school in Lewes, east Sussex, the recent floods have left her anxious and withdrawn. Unlike in countries such as Bangladesh or Mozambique, severe flooding causes few physical health risks in industrialised nations. The residents of Lewes or York are unlikely to go down with dysentry or cholera. However, up to 20% of natural disaster victims may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. Many will feel depressed and isolated, losing their sense of place and attachment, or developing obsessive anxieties as a result of their ordeal. The British Medical Journal has recently highlighted that the psychological costs of climate change are likely to be considerable. \"Shannon needs help,\" says her mother, Irene Hoad. And so does Irene. A young, single parent, she relied heavily on the network of neighbours in her block. Now all the ground-floor tenants have gone, decanted from their sodden, ruined homes into temporary accommodation. The council says it will take until next summer to make their homes habitable. Most will not be coming back. Four hundred families were made homeless by the Lewes floods. A third of them had no insurance or were underinsured. According to the Association of British Insurers (ABI) an estimated six million homeowners do not have contents cover. Some are living out of mobile homes in their gardens. Many more are in caravans, B&amp;Bs and rented accommodation all over the district. And some, the council frankly admits, it doesn't have a clue about. With families displaced and split up, and anxieties about insurance mounting by the day, the floods are taking a huge emotional toll. The good news is that increased social support, along with practical help, can significantly mitigate the less quantifiable psychological effects. By and large, though, this is being left up to voluntary agencies and community-minded individuals to provide. In Lewes, it's the volunteer bureau - run on a shoestring and under threat of closure - that's helping the uninsured to clear out their homes, get together some clothes and furniture, and start rebuilding their lives. A charitable \"hardship\" fund has also been set up to distribute to residents who have suffered distress. To date, more than \u00a3140,000 has been raised - much of it from members of the public. Mind, Age Concern and East Sussex Disability Association are among the voluntary groups which have set up a flood aftercare group with social services funding. More than 100 calls to the helpline range from people desperate to find a dehumidifier, to parents of children with drowned pets, to those - often with previous psychological problems - who have been deeply disturbed by the recent events. Many just want to talk. The more severely affected are being offered counselling and other specialist services. It's not just the flood victims who need support. There's the bin man who broke down in tears after clearing out countless contaminated homes; the firefighter racked with guilt because he was out helping others when his own family's home was flooded; the care staff dealing with loss and trauma at emergency centres. Many of these workers need a chance to unburden their own feelings. \"The full impact of these floods is unlikely to be felt for some time,\" says Phil Dodgson, head of adult psychology services at South Downs health trust, Sussex. \"Many people will be experiencing anger, guilt and feelings of dread. Some, the ones having persistent flash-backs or feeling very depressed and confused, will need help to reprocess their feelings.\" The psychological effect of severe flooding, as compared with a train crash or other major trauma, should not be underestimated, he says. The speed and force with which the water has risen, smashing down doors and sending furniture crashing against walls, has thrown whole communities into a state of shock. The most vulnerable people at a time like this are the young, old, disabled and mentally ill. In Crawley, West Sussex, 42 frail, elderly residents of a care home had to be evacuated in the early hours because the ground floor was under water. They left without anything, in their nightclothes, and ended up dispersed all over the county to residential homes as far away as Worthing. With few vacancies nearby, and their care home badly damaged, instant decisions had to be made about whether these transfers would be short-term or long-term. \"The psychological effect on these residents can only be imagined,\" says local operations manager, Pat Howe. In York, too, emergency decisions had to be made about evacuating elderly people when the River Ouse burst its banks. In one case, the community services director, Jim Crook, opted for sandbagging a care home which has very dependent residents, rather than risk moving them. Fortunately, the gamble paid off. In another instance, there was no choice. Thirty-five older residents had to be moved out of their riverside sheltered homes, and into temporary accommodation, after the floods took out a local power station. York's joint social services and housing department was able to do this relatively efficiently, Crook says, and to help the emergency services identify the most vulnerable people thoughout the worst of the flooding. For Peter Smurthwaite, who is severely visually impaired, the floods brought not just shock, trauma and the loss of his Lewes home, but also endless battles with his insurers over whether he can stay in a town where he knows his way around, or whether he must move to cheaper temporary accommodation miles away. East Sussex social services, like many around the country, has been hard-pressed to make even these imperfect arrangements. \"Because of the pressures on our community care budget, there's a lot less in-house provision,\" says Phil Gander, head of mental health services. \"We can't find money to ease bed-blocking, let alone provide an emergency infrastructure for evacuees.\" It was the aftercare group, run by Mind and other voluntary groups, that laid on a creche for flood-hit families, and which is starting up counselling sessions in Shannon's school. Irene hopes they will help. Sitting in her sunny living room, on a crisp cold morning, it's hard to imagine the day, just a few weeks ago, when the water came from nowhere, turning the road outside into a torrent. But it was real enough, and there have been several flood warnings since. Shannon keeps saying: \"Mummy, it's happening again.\" Irene and her neighbours try to brush her worries aside. They're concentrating instead on giving her a really good Christmas. Counting the cost Alison Benjamin The Association of British Insurers estimates that the floods may have caused up to \u00a3500m of damage. East Sussex county council and Lewes district council estimate that the cost to them is in the region of \u00a37m. Of this, \u00a3150,000 covers the cost of short-term care packages, extra staffing and the flood aftercare group. Other councils are still counting the initial costs. Damages to bridges and roads may not be fully known until water levels have dropped considerably. The Bellwin scheme allows councils, in theory, to claim back spending on emergencies from central government above a threshold. Currently councils have to put aside 0.2% of their budgets for emergency expenditure. A claim for any additional costs is then lodged with the government. Following the floods, deputy prime minister, John Prescott, pledged to increase the percentage the government covers from 85% to 100% of a claim. However, East Sussex has already had the majority of its claim rejected. Council leader David Rodgers says: \"We have been disappointed by the response of government to our application. It has confirmed what we thought about the scheme: it does not cover the costs of this type of disaster.\" This was one of the topics on the agenda at yesterday's central-local partnership, a forum chaired by Prescott where issues affecting local government are discussed. The Local Government Association fed in the main concerns from local authorities around the country - not least, who will foot the \u00a31.2bn bill for increased flood defences. The government has agreed to look at the whole funding mechanism.",

      "bodyText": "The mounting crisis in the care home sector is starting to hit staff, with the GMB general union claiming that employees of Servite Houses, in London, face earnings cuts of up to \u00a3250 a month under new contracts. Servite is among care home providers reviewing staff costs in an effort to balance the books. Martin Smith, GMB regional organiser, says: \"Cutting wages cuts care levels, so the current position is self-defeating. You can't have high standards and cheap labour.\" According to Servite, the new contracts have been accepted by a majority of staff concerned. The GMB, it says, represents only a small minority. Although some staff do face a shorter working week, with corresponding reduction of hourly earnings, many of them will in practice make up any shortfall through overtime. \"We are under increased economic pressure,\" says a company spokeswoman. The Servite dispute comes ahead of next week's first meeting of a \"strategic group\" set up by the government to develop a concordat between care home providers and local authorities. Under the plan, local - and health - authorities will be urged to act to stimulate development of care home capacity where there is an evident shortage. Official figures published last week suggest that the number of residential homes in England remained broadly stable at April 2000, compared to April 1999, but that the number of nursing homes fell 4% - equivalent to a loss of 8,000 beds. Home operators say they are fighting a losing battle for survival, as local authorities squeeze payment rates for state-funded residents. In one case, a nursing home run by Highcare Group, in Bridgwater, Somerset, is planning to evict 13 residents by December 22 in a dispute over fees.",

She is convinced that what high-flyers like herself lack is their own watering hole - based on Soho's fabled Groucho Club - and has made it her mission to start one. </p> <p>So far, 30-year-old Nijabat has got a lease on three adjoining shops awaiting conversion and been promised bank loans of \u00a3200,000. The site of the ArRum club is in the heart of loft-living, warehouse-clubbing, multi-racial Clerkenwell. So why do Muslims need a separate place to socialise? </p> <p>\"Because most of them feel a bit uncomfortable about going to a bar or being offered alcohol,\" Nijabat says. While it's true that many second and third generation Muslims here feel more integrated and outgoing than their parents, Nijabat reckons their specific needs are not being met by the commercial sector. </p> <p>She's tired, too, of negative images of Islam in the media. There's a whole vibrant side of Muslim culture - marked by an interest in art, architecture and literature. Some of this she plans to bring to ArRum. </p> <p>Her club will be cashing in on several congruent trends. There's the economic and professional success of many young Asians - enough of them for the journal Asian Eye and the Financial Times to jointly compile an Asian \"rich list\". Only a proportion of those are Muslim, of course, but she reckons there is substantial \"new money\" being earned by her co-religionists. </p> <p>Nijabat herself is an example. Her father had a lifelong career in the army; she qualified as a barrister, but then felt she had the entrepreneurial gene, and decided to give herself two years to see if she could fill a niche she'd identified \"at the upper end of the Muslim market\". </p> <p>While Nijabat isn't shy about saying that she wants to make big money - though her immediate preoccupation is with borrowing to get the club running early in the new year - she believes the venture will be giving something back to the community. Members will be encouraged to mentor young hopefuls in their business or professional fields. </p> <p>Her efforts have proved that a network already operates among professional Muslims, but also revealsome weaknesses. Several Muslim architects were among those she consulted about converting the shops into a club. However, their designs were disappointingly traditional for her taste, and the contract went elsewhere. </p> <p>Even more surprising is the reluctance of young Muslim entrepreneurs to put up a sizeable slice of the \u00a3300,000 ArRum requires, though several have offered a few thousand pounds. Other enterprises, based on identifying such niche markets as the grey pound and the pink pound, have found it easier to get started. Can it be that Nijabat is alone in believing that the Muslim pound also likes to relax and be shown a good time? </p> <p>\u0095 For details of ArRum, telephone 020-7415 7111.</p>",

Her father had a lifelong career in the army; she qualified as a barrister, but then felt she had the entrepreneurial gene, and decided to give herself two years to see if she could fill a niche she'd identified \"at the upper end of the Muslim market\". While Nijabat isn't shy about saying that she wants to make big money - though her immediate preoccupation is with borrowing to get the club running early in the new year - she believes the venture will be giving something back to the community. Members will be encouraged to mentor young hopefuls in their business or professional fields. Her efforts have proved that a network already operates among professional Muslims, but also revealsome weaknesses. Several Muslim architects were among those she consulted about converting the shops into a club. However, their designs were disappointingly traditional for her taste, and the contract went elsewhere. Even more surprising is the reluctance of young Muslim entrepreneurs to put up a sizeable slice of the \u00a3300,000 ArRum requires, though several have offered a few thousand pounds. Other enterprises, based on identifying such niche markets as the grey pound and the pink pound, have found it easier to get started. Can it be that Nijabat is alone in believing that the Muslim pound also likes to relax and be shown a good time? \u0095 For details of ArRum, telephone 020-7415 7111.",

But who or what can help you? According to the largest survey of people's views on treatment for mental illness, to be published on Friday, there are few options available, or informed choices made, when it comes to the use of psychiatric drugs. </p> <p>A Question of Choice, produced by three charities, the National Schizophrenia Fellowship (NSF), Manic Depression Fellowship and Mind, reveals that 62% of people suffering mental illness had no choice of medication, and almost half stopped taking it without medical advice. </p> <p>Most of the 2,663 people surveyed had diagnoses of schizophrenia, although many had manic depression or depression. The two main drug treatments for schizophrenia are \"typical\" and \"atypical\" antipsychotics. </p> <p>The typicals (common ones are haloperidol, chlorpromazine and stelazine) have been around longest. While they help some people, they can cause severe long-term side-effects, sometimes irreversible even if treatment is stopped. The drugs are banned in parts of the US, following law suits linked to side-effects, and, according to Gary Hogman, head of policy and campaigns at the NSF, some British experts say such drugs would not be licensed if they were being introduced to the market now. </p> <p>Atypicals - such as olanzapine, clozapine and risperidone - are the newer, growing group. Their side-effects are usually milder, and a striking finding from the survey relates to people's experiences of these versus typical antipsychotics. Asked \"Which was the worst medicine you've ever had?\", the highest ranked drugs were the three common typicals. And the best? The three atypicals - plus lithium, used mainly for manic depression. </p> <p>Doctors can prescribe from either category, yet 84% of drugs used for schizophrenia are typical antipsychotics. The higher cost of atypicals, and conservative tendencies within the medical profession, may override clinical judgment and patient preference. Hogman says the survey shows that what is lacking, and must be provided, is choice. \"People want comprehensive information, and to be allowed to choose what works best for them, not always get the cheapest option or whatever the doctor usually gives,\" he says. </p> <p>Hogman argues that prescribing cheaper drugs is short-sighted. \"Some people on typical antipsychotics need other drugs to combat side-effects. They frequently stop taking medication and, as a result, relapse is common. </p> <p>\"In short, many people are given drugs which they hate, and don't stick with, even though there are alternatives. It's a false economy. Their symptoms are not controlled, they may have repeated hospital admissions, at high cost to health, social care and sometimes the criminal justice system, and have seriously and needlessly impaired quality of life.\" </p> <p>The national institute for clinical excellence (Nice), which advises the government on medical interventions, has just announced that it will assess drugs for schizophrenia - a process expected to take a year before yielding recommendations. The NSF hopes that this evaluation will not pay more attention to cold data of controlled trials than to hard evidence - the experiences of people who take the drugs. </p> <p>The value of medication, for many, is clear from the survey. When asked \"What single thing had or could make the biggest difference to quality of life?\", the largest number cited medication. This included people for whom medicine has already made the biggest difference and those who view improved medicine as the best thing that could happen. </p> <p>But the survey does not end there. It also asked people's views about non-drug treatments - from psychotherapy to exercise. </p> <p>As Hogman says: \"Medication was our starting point, but the survey's main colour is its illustration of the importance of a holistic approach. It demonstrates that those who are unwell benefit immensely from the occupational and leisure activities that we all like.\" </p> <p>This holistic approach to mental illness is the cornerstone of NSF philosophy, based on recognising the interplay between mental and physical health. </p> <p>Hogman says: \"It's just common sense. There aren't two groups in society, ill people and well people. Mental illness affects all walks of life. Most people know what they need and enjoy - such as having enough money, pleasant accommodation, things to do and people to share them with - and those who are ill are no exception. </p> <p>\"Without these things, the risk of people suffering illness is increased, and getting better and staying well is more difficult. The picture is further complicated by the fact that the illness itself impedes ability to access them.\" </p> <p>Mental Health Foundation statistics support these views: psychiatric admissions are three times greater in government-defined \"deprived\" areas, and the risk of suicide among the unemployed is 11 times higher than among those in work. </p> <p>These figures and the survey's findings do not solve the mysteries of what causes mental illness, nor do they imply that good housing or jobs can alone prevent people from becoming ill, or cure them. </p> <p>However, many interacting factors, from genetics to the environment, are important in causing mental illness and give clues as to useful interventions. </p> <p>One of the survey's most striking statistics is that the most appreciated interventions are not complex or specialised. Exercise, training and education were ranked top by 85% of those who had tried them, and art/music therapy was best liked by 81%.

The hand of man has scarcely ever been visible for the first 100km of the river's course ... until now. </p> <p>In the 80s, the Greek government decided to go ahead with a scheme to build two dams on the upper section of the river, creating two artificial lakes. The first, at Sikia, will flood more than 20km of the river's natural course; the second, at Mesohora, will flood a further 12km, as well as the lower reaches of numerous tributaries, leaving scarcely 15km of the river's entire length unaffected by human intervention. </p> <p>The purpose of the scheme is to power two hydro-electric stations and to divert water from the Sikia lake, via a 17.4km tunnel, to the farms and towns of the plain of Thessaly to the east of the Pindos mountains, for irrigation and drinking. </p> <p>The financial cost obviously is colossal. The work had just begun when I last visited the area in 1987. It has been going on ever since, in spite of the fact that Greece's own supreme court ruled against the scheme in 1992 on environmental grounds, and again this year on cultural grounds because of the destruction of classified monuments. The EU has also suspended funding: the Achel\u00f6os valley is an EU special protection area because of its rare birds and habitats, as are its delta and the linked Mesolonghi lagoon. These are also listed under the Ramsar Convention as wetlands of international importance and are already adversely affected by the two existing dams on the river's lower reaches. All these sites are included in the Natura 2000 list of Europe's environmentally most important sites. </p> <p>At the moment, only the two hydro-electric plants and the dam at Mesohora have been completed.

But if the project is ever completed these landscapes, already badly scarred, will be lost forever. </p> <p>There may well be further consequences that are difficult to predict. What effects, for example, will the creation of such a large body of water have on local microclimates and ecosystems?

      "body": "<p>It's typical tree-planting weather: wintery, with a stiff breeze blowing off Loch Lomond. The mist clears and the hills beneath are the dull russets and greens of an ageing Cox's apple. But the band of stalwarts out planting saplings on a Saturday morning are not your typical conservation enthusiasts. All arrived in Britain just a few months ago. They are still struggling to learn English, find schools and nursery places for their kids, survive on vouchers and a few pounds in cash each week and get used to life on Glasgow housing estates. You might think that replanting a native forest in Cashel Farm, a 40-minute drive north of Glasgow, would be low on their list of priorities. You'd be wrong. </p> <p>Nasrin, a hairdresser, and her engineer husband and their two children, aged 10 and four, came to Britain from Iran five months ago. After two weeks sitting on the bare floor of a truck, they arrived in Dover sick and exhausted, but within a couple of weeks of being sent to Glasgow, they'd heard about a unique project run by the Black Environment Network (BEN), the Scottish Refugee Council and British Trust for Conservation Volunteers. </p> <p>\"We came every month from then on,\" says Nasrin, keeping an eye on her children, who are chasing each other round the saplings. \"It's green and beautiful and there is clean air here. In Iran, we would go to the countryside every two weeks, and for children there was the park, the cinema, many other entertainments. But here we have nothing, nothing.\" </p> <p>Her eldest child, Ashkan, can go to school, but there's no nursery place for their pre-school daughter and she has no opportunity to mix with other children. \"This is a big space for all the children to play,\" says Nasrin. \"We like the lake and the people are so friendly. If we couldn't come for some reason, my children would go mad - they have so much energy.\" </p> <p>They're not the only ones. Sorour and her five-year-old daughter Sheida are also regular attendees.

      "bodyText": "It's typical tree-planting weather: wintery, with a stiff breeze blowing off Loch Lomond. The mist clears and the hills beneath are the dull russets and greens of an ageing Cox's apple. But the band of stalwarts out planting saplings on a Saturday morning are not your typical conservation enthusiasts. All arrived in Britain just a few months ago. They are still struggling to learn English, find schools and nursery places for their kids, survive on vouchers and a few pounds in cash each week and get used to life on Glasgow housing estates. You might think that replanting a native forest in Cashel Farm, a 40-minute drive north of Glasgow, would be low on their list of priorities. You'd be wrong. Nasrin, a hairdresser, and her engineer husband and their two children, aged 10 and four, came to Britain from Iran five months ago. After two weeks sitting on the bare floor of a truck, they arrived in Dover sick and exhausted, but within a couple of weeks of being sent to Glasgow, they'd heard about a unique project run by the Black Environment Network (BEN), the Scottish Refugee Council and British Trust for Conservation Volunteers. \"We came every month from then on,\" says Nasrin, keeping an eye on her children, who are chasing each other round the saplings. \"It's green and beautiful and there is clean air here. In Iran, we would go to the countryside every two weeks, and for children there was the park, the cinema, many other entertainments. But here we have nothing, nothing.\" Her eldest child, Ashkan, can go to school, but there's no nursery place for their pre-school daughter and she has no opportunity to mix with other children. \"This is a big space for all the children to play,\" says Nasrin. \"We like the lake and the people are so friendly. If we couldn't come for some reason, my children would go mad - they have so much energy.\" They're not the only ones. Sorour and her five-year-old daughter Sheida are also regular attendees. Unlike Nasrin and her family, Sorour fled Iran without her husband. \"I was in danger, so we had to leave,\" she says. \"I could complain to you about many things here in Glasgow, and I will.

      "body": "<p>In the offices of one of Birmingham's Sure Start schemes, there is a fat book, a 150-page plan detailing how the project, when it's up and running, could transform the lives of children under the age of four in disadvantaged families in Ladywood. At the other scheme, a few miles away in Billesley, months spent preparing sums and surveys have been distilled into a leaflet listing the help now at hand. </p> <p>It is user-friendly - and needs to be - to guide parents through the web of midwife, health visitor, social worker, speech therapist, childminder, parent support coordinator, creche co-ordinator, inclusion worker (special needs), home start volunteers (practical home support) for a suburban area where about 800 families have children aged four and under. </p> <p>The government has identified 200 deprived areas needing assistance, where 500 Sure Start schemes will be up and running by 2004. </p> <p>Coloured dots mark the different waves of Sure Starts on the wallmap in Naomi Eisenstadt's office in London. As head of unit, she's charged with implementing the partnerships which link a locality's childcare needs (as listed by parents) with a guaranteed budget of \u00a32-3m, professional input and advice, and monitoring of targets. This is managed through a public service agreement between the agency and local projects. Eisenstadt calls it \"a very elegant, innovative combination of top down [Sure Start is funded by the health and education ministries] and bottom up [parents and local services]\". </p> <p>Ministers have set the targets, mostly expressed as percentage improvements to be attained.

At the other scheme, a few miles away in Billesley, months spent preparing sums and surveys have been distilled into a leaflet listing the help now at hand. It is user-friendly - and needs to be - to guide parents through the web of midwife, health visitor, social worker, speech therapist, childminder, parent support coordinator, creche co-ordinator, inclusion worker (special needs), home start volunteers (practical home support) for a suburban area where about 800 families have children aged four and under. The government has identified 200 deprived areas needing assistance, where 500 Sure Start schemes will be up and running by 2004. Coloured dots mark the different waves of Sure Starts on the wallmap in Naomi Eisenstadt's office in London. As head of unit, she's charged with implementing the partnerships which link a locality's childcare needs (as listed by parents) with a guaranteed budget of \u00a32-3m, professional input and advice, and monitoring of targets. This is managed through a public service agreement between the agency and local projects. Eisenstadt calls it \"a very elegant, innovative combination of top down [Sure Start is funded by the health and education ministries] and bottom up [parents and local services]\". Ministers have set the targets, mostly expressed as percentage improvements to be attained. These cover the social and emotional development, and the health and ability to learn, of the under-fours. Since the scheme started 18 months ago, Eisenstadt says one aim - a 5% reduction in the number of low birthweight babies - has been replaced by the clearer aim of getting mothers-to-be not to smoke during pregnancy.

As with many other children at her school in Lewes, east Sussex, the recent floods have left her anxious and withdrawn. </p> <p>Unlike in countries such as Bangladesh or Mozambique, severe flooding causes few physical health risks in industrialised nations.

And so does Irene. A young, single parent, she relied heavily on the network of neighbours in her block. Now all the ground-floor tenants have gone, decanted from their sodden, ruined homes into temporary accommodation. The council says it will take until next summer to make their homes habitable. Most will not be coming back. </p> <p>Four hundred families were made homeless by the Lewes floods. A third of them had no insurance or were underinsured. According to the Association of British Insurers (ABI) an estimated six million homeowners do not have contents cover. Some are living out of mobile homes in their gardens.

To date, more than \u00a3140,000 has been raised - much of it from members of the public. </p> <p>Mind, Age Concern and East Sussex Disability Association are among the voluntary groups which have set up a flood aftercare group with social services funding. More than 100 calls to the helpline range from people desperate to find a dehumidifier, to parents of children with drowned pets, to those - often with previous psychological problems - who have been deeply disturbed by the recent events. Many just want to talk. The more severely affected are being offered counselling and other specialist services. </p> <p>It's not just the flood victims who need support. There's the bin man who broke down in tears after clear ing out countless contaminated homes; the firefighter racked with guilt because he was out helping others when his own family's home was flooded; the care staff dealing with loss and trauma at emergency centres. Many of these workers need a chance to unburden their own feelings. </p> <p>\"The full impact of these floods is unlikely to be felt for some time,\" says Phil Dodgson, head of adult psychology services at South Downs health trust, Sussex. \"Many people will be experiencing anger, guilt and feelings of dread. Some, the ones having persistent flash-backs or feeling very depressed and confused, will need help to reprocess their feelings.\" </p> <p>The psychological effect of severe flooding, as compared with a train crash or other major trauma, should not be underestimated, he says. The speed and force with which the water has risen, smashing down doors and sending furniture crashing against walls, has thrown whole communities into a state of shock. </p> <p>The most vulnerable people at a time like this are the young, old, disabled and mentally ill. In Crawley, West Sussex, 42 frail, elderly residents of a care home had to be evacuated in the early hours because the ground floor was under water. They left without anything, in their nightclothes, and ended up dispersed all over the county to residential homes as far away as Worthing. With few vacancies nearby, and their care home badly damaged, instant decisions had to be made about whether these transfers would be short-term or long-term. \"The psychological effect on these residents can only be imagined,\" says local operations manager, Pat Howe. </p> <p>In York, too, emergency decisions had to be made about evacuating elderly people when the River Ouse burst its banks. In one case, the community services director, Jim Crook, opted for sandbagging a care home which has very dependent residents, rather than risk moving them. Fortunately, the gamble paid off. </p> <p>In another instance, there was no choice. Thirty-five older residents had to be moved out of their riverside sheltered homes, and into temporary accommodation, after the floods took out a local power station. York's joint social services and housing department was able to do this relatively efficiently, Crook says, and to help the emergency services identify the most vulnerable people thoughout the worst of the flooding. </p> <p>For Peter Smurthwaite, who is severely visually impaired, the floods brought not just shock, trauma and the loss of his Lewes home, but also endless battles with his insurers over whether he can stay in a town where he knows his way around, or whether he must move to cheaper temporary accommodation miles away. </p> <p>East Sussex social services, like many around the country, has been hard-pressed to make even these imperfect arrangements. \"Because of the pressures on our community care budget, there's a lot less in-house provision,\" says Phil Gander, head of mental health services. \"We can't find money to ease bed-blocking, let alone provide an emergency infrastructure for evacuees.\" </p> <p>It was the aftercare group, run by Mind and other voluntary groups, that laid on a creche for flood-hit families, and which is starting up counselling sessions in Shannon's school.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the offices of one of Birmingham's Sure Start schemes, there is a fat book, a 150-page plan detailing how the project, when it's up and running, could transform the lives of children under the age of four in disadvantaged families in Ladywood. At the other scheme, a few miles away in Billesley, months spent preparing sums and surveys have been distilled into a leaflet listing the help now at hand. </p> <p>It is user-friendly - and needs to be - to guide parents through the web of midwife, health visitor, social worker, speech therapist, childminder, parent support coordinator, creche co-ordinator, inclusion worker (special needs), home start volunteers (practical home support) for a suburban area where about 800 families have children aged four and under. </p> <p>The government has identified 200 deprived areas needing assistance, where 500 Sure Start schemes will be up and running by 2004. </p> <p>Coloured dots mark the different waves of Sure Starts on the wallmap in Naomi Eisenstadt's office in London. As head of unit, she's charged with implementing the partnerships which link a locality's childcare needs (as listed by parents) with a guaranteed budget of \u00a32-3m, professional input and advice, and monitoring of targets. This is managed through a public service agreement between the agency and local projects. Eisenstadt calls it \"a very elegant, innovative combination of top down [Sure Start is funded by the health and education ministries] and bottom up [parents and local services]\". </p> <p>Ministers have set the targets, mostly expressed as percentage improvements to be attained. These cover the social and emotional development, and the health and ability to learn, of the under-fours. Since the scheme started 18 months ago, Eisenstadt says one aim - a 5% reduction in the number of low birthweight babies - has been replaced by the clearer aim of getting mothers-to-be not to smoke during pregnancy. Also, there is a greater emphasis on links with employment, such as New Deal for lone parents. </p> <p>\"In terms of specific targets, we are setting ones that individual communities can work towards,\" says Eisenstadt. \"We have never worked this way before, so we'll have to learn as we go along </p> <p>Setting goals and adopting a seemingly prescriptive approach could give the impression that it is yet another preachy New Labour policy. But Sure Starts have been conceived as partnerships on the basis that, in order to work, they have to be parent-friendly, non-judgmental towards families with problems, and locally-led. </p> <p>You can see the importance of getting a community to make a bid for Sure Start money, and for local people to be involved, in the two Birmingham projects. In Ladywood, a small local charity, Karis, took the lead. Angie King, a former nurse onsecondment from Karis to get the scheme off the ground, says the community was so used to being overlooked that it could scarcely believe it was really getting a grant. </p> <p>Enthusiastic parents quickly listed their wants. Top of the list was something quite simple - a support team of volunteers who could help with other children when one child in a family was ill or when parents were out shopping. But the scheme is developing from there. King says that because supermarkets are distant from the area, one aim is to help teach parents about nutrition by starting a centre which serves and sells cheap, nourishing foods. </p> <p>In Billesley, local people were anxious to expand an existing facility with a good reputation, the Chinnbrook Children and Parents' Project. Bhavna Solanki, programme manager, says it is an excellent core; and Sure Start will be spending about \u00a31m on a building programme, to offer more services and attract more parents. </p> <p>Home visits by childcare staff are a key element of Sure Start's approach, but almost all the projects also want their own centre - either purpose-built or suitably adapted premises - with clinics, play areas and the rest. </p> <p>Billesley has got off to a flying start because there is an existing community centre on which to graft. Ladywood (which came in a later batch of Sure Starts) has a much more difficult job to get established. </p> <p>Sure Start's physical presence there at the moment is a ground-floor office in a block of flats. King works there, and has set aside part of the room for a play area. Plans for a purpose-built centre are still on the architect's drawing board. </p> <p>She is not daunted, but says that getting the structure in place is hard work. Unlike other cities, none of the places of worship or community groups in Ladywood run groups for the under-fours and their parents. So everything has to start from scratch. </p> <p>Ladywood is in the process of appointing most of the 30 staff to its team. In Billesley, they are already in place, with Solanki at the hub. But until Chinnbrook is extended to provide permanent offices, their base is the offices of a local church - and will be for another year at least. </p> <p>This does not seem to worry them too much. Child centres are crucial to Sure Start's success; but the input of staff is equally, if not more, important. Several who worked with health or social services in the Birmingham area before joining Solanki's team feel liberated. In Sure Start, they say, they are able to do preventive work with families where the life chances of young kids are bleak. Before, their work was mostly post-crisis. </p> <p>They are learning from each other, too, and doing new things. Ruth Field, a former childminder, now networks among other childminders - giving them, for the first time, support and encouragement, while monitoring the standards of a group much in demand as more mothers go out to work. </p> <p>The scale of what Sure Start is doing is not always apparent in Ladywood. There are isolated single teenage mothers for Angela Rainbow, parent support coordinator, to cheer up and chat to. And there are parents who know no nursery rhymes to teach their babies; they will be glad that team member Christina Ali has specially compiled a book for them to use. </p> <p>The Billesley team hums with good humour; there is almost an air of novelty that different disciplines can work together. One of the tests of Sure Start's success will be professional cooperation. Eisenstadt says: \"It's my experience that between health, education and social services, two work well together - though which two is completely random. Getting the three to work together is extremely difficult.\" </p> <p>Her other concern is that one of these service providers might be tempted to reduce provision in places which have a Sure Start scheme. They would be unwise to do so, for although the projects are being funded for three years initially, it is likely that they will become community focal points and fixtures for much longer. </p> <p>From the frontline, there is concern about the initial time limit. King says that the targets are fine, but she thinks that they might take longer to meet than civil servants and ministers have allowed. </p> <p>Maybe it is just as well that the government has given itself 20 years in which to eradicate child poverty. Well before then, though, we should be able to see if Sure Start has made much difference to a raft of problems that has long perplexed the social policy makers. </p> <p> <strong>Schemes and dreams</strong><br> Alison Benjamin<br></p> <p> By 2004, the government will have poured more than \u00a31bn into 500 Sure Stuart schemes providing support for one-third of disadvantaged children under four years old across England - some 400,000 in all. </p> <p>Initially, \u00a3452m was earmarked for some 250 schemes being set up between1999 -2002. </p> <p>The first 21 trailblazers got the go- ahead in April 1999 and were up and running by the autumn. Since then more than 100 schemes have received a share of the funding. </p> <p>In this year's government spending review, an extra \u00a3580m was announced up until March 2004. </p> <p>New Sure Start schemes are starting up each week. They are led by a variety of agencies - from charities to health authorities and local community organistions. </p> <p>For example, a Leeds partnership, led by the NSPCC, has received \u00a32.8m to provide extra childcare, health visitor drop in sessions and additional playgroups for 1,080 children under the age of four. </p> <p>In the Ore Valley, Hastings, three Sure Start centres are already providing a health and baby clinic, \"cooking on a budget\" classes, and speech and language therapy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the offices of one of Birmingham's Sure Start schemes, there is a fat book, a 150-page plan detailing how the project, when it's up and running, could transform the lives of children under the age of four in disadvantaged families in Ladywood. At the other scheme, a few miles away in Billesley, months spent preparing sums and surveys have been distilled into a leaflet listing the help now at hand. It is user-friendly - and needs to be - to guide parents through the web of midwife, health visitor, social worker, speech therapist, childminder, parent support coordinator, creche co-ordinator, inclusion worker (special needs), home start volunteers (practical home support) for a suburban area where about 800 families have children aged four and under. The government has identified 200 deprived areas needing assistance, where 500 Sure Start schemes will be up and running by 2004. Coloured dots mark the different waves of Sure Starts on the wallmap in Naomi Eisenstadt's office in London. As head of unit, she's charged with implementing the partnerships which link a locality's childcare needs (as listed by parents) with a guaranteed budget of \u00a32-3m, professional input and advice, and monitoring of targets. This is managed through a public service agreement between the agency and local projects. Eisenstadt calls it \"a very elegant, innovative combination of top down [Sure Start is funded by the health and education ministries] and bottom up [parents and local services]\". Ministers have set the targets, mostly expressed as percentage improvements to be attained. These cover the social and emotional development, and the health and ability to learn, of the under-fours. Since the scheme started 18 months ago, Eisenstadt says one aim - a 5% reduction in the number of low birthweight babies - has been replaced by the clearer aim of getting mothers-to-be not to smoke during pregnancy. Also, there is a greater emphasis on links with employment, such as New Deal for lone parents. \"In terms of specific targets, we are setting ones that individual communities can work towards,\" says Eisenstadt. \"We have never worked this way before, so we'll have to learn as we go along Setting goals and adopting a seemingly prescriptive approach could give the impression that it is yet another preachy New Labour policy. But Sure Starts have been conceived as partnerships on the basis that, in order to work, they have to be parent-friendly, non-judgmental towards families with problems, and locally-led. You can see the importance of getting a community to make a bid for Sure Start money, and for local people to be involved, in the two Birmingham projects. In Ladywood, a small local charity, Karis, took the lead. Angie King, a former nurse onsecondment from Karis to get the scheme off the ground, says the community was so used to being overlooked that it could scarcely believe it was really getting a grant. Enthusiastic parents quickly listed their wants. Top of the list was something quite simple - a support team of volunteers who could help with other children when one child in a family was ill or when parents were out shopping. But the scheme is developing from there. King says that because supermarkets are distant from the area, one aim is to help teach parents about nutrition by starting a centre which serves and sells cheap, nourishing foods. In Billesley, local people were anxious to expand an existing facility with a good reputation, the Chinnbrook Children and Parents' Project. Bhavna Solanki, programme manager, says it is an excellent core; and Sure Start will be spending about \u00a31m on a building programme, to offer more services and attract more parents. Home visits by childcare staff are a key element of Sure Start's approach, but almost all the projects also want their own centre - either purpose-built or suitably adapted premises - with clinics, play areas and the rest. Billesley has got off to a flying start because there is an existing community centre on which to graft. Ladywood (which came in a later batch of Sure Starts) has a much more difficult job to get established. Sure Start's physical presence there at the moment is a ground-floor office in a block of flats. King works there, and has set aside part of the room for a play area. Plans for a purpose-built centre are still on the architect's drawing board. She is not daunted, but says that getting the structure in place is hard work. Unlike other cities, none of the places of worship or community groups in Ladywood run groups for the under-fours and their parents. So everything has to start from scratch. Ladywood is in the process of appointing most of the 30 staff to its team. In Billesley, they are already in place, with Solanki at the hub. But until Chinnbrook is extended to provide permanent offices, their base is the offices of a local church - and will be for another year at least. This does not seem to worry them too much. Child centres are crucial to Sure Start's success; but the input of staff is equally, if not more, important. Several who worked with health or social services in the Birmingham area before joining Solanki's team feel liberated. In Sure Start, they say, they are able to do preventive work with families where the life chances of young kids are bleak. Before, their work was mostly post-crisis. They are learning from each other, too, and doing new things. Ruth Field, a former childminder, now networks among other childminders - giving them, for the first time, support and encouragement, while monitoring the standards of a group much in demand as more mothers go out to work. The scale of what Sure Start is doing is not always apparent in Ladywood. There are isolated single teenage mothers for Angela Rainbow, parent support coordinator, to cheer up and chat to. And there are parents who know no nursery rhymes to teach their babies; they will be glad that team member Christina Ali has specially compiled a book for them to use. The Billesley team hums with good humour; there is almost an air of novelty that different disciplines can work together. One of the tests of Sure Start's success will be professional cooperation. Eisenstadt says: \"It's my experience that between health, education and social services, two work well together - though which two is completely random. Getting the three to work together is extremely difficult.\" Her other concern is that one of these service providers might be tempted to reduce provision in places which have a Sure Start scheme. They would be unwise to do so, for although the projects are being funded for three years initially, it is likely that they will become community focal points and fixtures for much longer. From the frontline, there is concern about the initial time limit. King says that the targets are fine, but she thinks that they might take longer to meet than civil servants and ministers have allowed. Maybe it is just as well that the government has given itself 20 years in which to eradicate child poverty. Well before then, though, we should be able to see if Sure Start has made much difference to a raft of problems that has long perplexed the social policy makers. Schemes and dreams Alison Benjamin By 2004, the government will have poured more than \u00a31bn into 500 Sure Stuart schemes providing support for one-third of disadvantaged children under four years old across England - some 400,000 in all. Initially, \u00a3452m was earmarked for some 250 schemes being set up between1999 -2002. The first 21 trailblazers got the go- ahead in April 1999 and were up and running by the autumn. Since then more than 100 schemes have received a share of the funding. In this year's government spending review, an extra \u00a3580m was announced up until March 2004. New Sure Start schemes are starting up each week. They are led by a variety of agencies - from charities to health authorities and local community organistions. For example, a Leeds partnership, led by the NSPCC, has received \u00a32.8m to provide extra childcare, health visitor drop in sessions and additional playgroups for 1,080 children under the age of four. In the Ore Valley, Hastings, three Sure Start centres are already providing a health and baby clinic, \"cooking on a budget\" classes, and speech and language therapy.",

German opponents seldom give second chances and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side did not want to find themselves having to chase the game. </p> <p>The outcome of the encounter was always going to rest on who held the balance in midfield - Patrick Vieira and Gilles Grimandi for Arsenal or Stefan Effenberg and Jens Jeremies for Bayern. While this is true of most games the strength each side enjoyed in the central areas made it especially important in last night's match. </p> <p>Not that the play had time to develop any kind of pattern before Arsenal went ahead after three minutes. So sweet was the build-up and so clinical the execution that it was hard to see why Arsenal had been finding it hard to score goals. </p> <p>The move started with Robert Pires on the left. The Frenchman played the ball low into the middle where his compatriot, Thierry Henry, fooled the defence by allowing it to run to Nwankwo Kanu before driving the Nigerian's return pass into the net. </p> <p>This was exactly the start Arsenal needed to bolster their confidence. For a while the Bayern penalty area was full of bodies as Wenger's team sought a swift second goal but once Bayern had demonstrated the speed of their counterattacks Arsenal needed to guard against leaving themselves exposed. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Vieira and Grimandi had gained the early grip in midfield the situation demanded and the closeness of their links with Henry and Kanu ensured that Arsenal's movements maintained their early momentum. </p> <p>With Kanu strolling into likely spaces in the approaches to goal, Arsenal still had the subtlety the Dutchman normally gives them. Effenberg occasionally moved forward to set up the beginnings of a Bayern attack but with his team on the defensive found it hard to maintain any pressure. </p> <p>After 37 minutes Arsenal came close to increasing their lead. A corner from Pires was nodded on by Henry to Tony Adams whose header was intercepted by Thomas Linke but still hit the near post. </p> <p>Four minutes later Mehmet Scholl had an opportunity to exploit Bayern's good fortune but missed it. A long pass from Effenberg found Giovane Elber in space behind Martin Keown and the Brazilian laid the ball back to Scholl who should have done better than drag his shot wide. </p> <p>Not that Arsenal ever considered slowing the tempo in order to sit on their lead. After 49 minutes a shrewd pass from Vieira set up Fredrik Ljungberg for second goal but the Swede snatched at his shot and wafted it over the bar. </p> <p>No matter it seemed: nine minutes into the second half Arsenal at last scored the goal their continued domination demanded. Again Bayern were deceived by quick thinking and confounded by the pace and precision of the move. </p> <p>This time Vieira surprised the opposition with a quick free-kick to release Henry on the right. The striker took the ball towards the byline before laying it back into the path of Kanu, who calmly beat Oliver Kahn with an angled left-footed shot off the far post. </p> <p>That seemed to be that but within a minute Bayern had scored and after another 10 they were level. First Adams and Keown failed to cut out a long free-kick from the right, allowing Scholl to slip the ball back to Michael Tarnat who drove it emphatically past Alex Manninger. </p> <p>Then Scholl brought the scores level with a twice-taken free-kick. Ljungberg was booked for not retreating the proper distance as Tarnat thumped the ball against the wall, and Scholl took three steps before floating it beyond Manninger's reach into the near corner of the net. </p> <p> <strong> Arsenal</strong> (4-4-2): Manninger; Cole, Keown, Adams, Luzhny; Ljungberg, Grimandi, Vieira, Pires; Kanu, Henry. </p> <p><strong> Bayern Munich </strong> (3-4-3): Kahn; Linke, Sforza, Kuffour; Sagnol, Jeremies, Effenberg, Tarnat; Salihamidzic, Elber, Scholl. </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> S.

That seemed to be that but within a minute Bayern had scored and after another 10 they were level. First Adams and Keown failed to cut out a long free-kick from the right, allowing Scholl to slip the ball back to Michael Tarnat who drove it emphatically past Alex Manninger. Then Scholl brought the scores level with a twice-taken free-kick. Ljungberg was booked for not retreating the proper distance as Tarnat thumped the ball against the wall, and Scholl took three steps before floating it beyond Manninger's reach into the near corner of the net. Arsenal (4-4-2): Manninger; Cole, Keown, Adams, Luzhny; Ljungberg, Grimandi, Vieira, Pires; Kanu, Henry. Bayern Munich (3-4-3): Kahn; Linke, Sforza, Kuffour; Sagnol, Jeremies, Effenberg, Tarnat; Salihamidzic, Elber, Scholl. Referee: S. Braschi (Italy).",

      "body": "<p>University students have two costs to meet: tuition fees and living expenses. Most students are entitled to some financial help from the local authority with tuition fees, but the living costs will have to be met entirely through student loans and parental contributions. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.ucas.co.uk/\">Universities and Colleges Admissions Services</a> says most students will pay around \u00a31,050 in tuition fees for the 2000/2001 academic year. Unfortunately, this figure is likely to increase by about \u00a325 a year. And some Universities charge more - Oxford's current top-up rate is \u00a31,075 a year. </p> <p>Students apply to their local authority for help with fees and their case is assessed by examining parental income. An estimated third of students whose parental income is taken into account will not have to pay fees. </p> <p>For living costs, students will be expected to take out a student loan, topped up by parental contributions or part-time and holiday work. For the current financial year, the maximum loans available are \u00a34,590 for those studying in London, \u00a33,725 for those studying outside London and \u00a32,950 for those living at home.

      "bodyText": "University students have two costs to meet: tuition fees and living expenses. Most students are entitled to some financial help from the local authority with tuition fees, but the living costs will have to be met entirely through student loans and parental contributions. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Services says most students will pay around \u00a31,050 in tuition fees for the 2000/2001 academic year. Unfortunately, this figure is likely to increase by about \u00a325 a year. And some Universities charge more - Oxford's current top-up rate is \u00a31,075 a year. Students apply to their local authority for help with fees and their case is assessed by examining parental income. An estimated third of students whose parental income is taken into account will not have to pay fees. For living costs, students will be expected to take out a student loan, topped up by parental contributions or part-time and holiday work. For the current financial year, the maximum loans available are \u00a34,590 for those studying in London, \u00a33,725 for those studying outside London and \u00a32,950 for those living at home. Contact the Student Loans Company for details. The loans do not have to be repaid until the student leaves university and starts earning over a certain amount (currently \u00a310,000 per year). Interest on the loan is linked to inflation, and is therefore much lower than commercial rates. However, the National Union of Students estimates that living costs are actually much higher than the maximum loans.

The time is 1975, the setting is an obscure house in the Mississippi Delta.

      "bodyText": "\"If you sing a song about Atlanta, you got to have been to Atlanta,\" says an old blues folk hero in Stephen Jeffreys's new play; and it is a line that acquires ever greater irony as the evening progresses. For Jeffreys, a white British writer, here attempts to get to the heart of the black American experience; and the result, while theatrically skilful, often feels like a piece of artful impersonation. Jeffreys's technique is to apply the Faust myth to the American south. The time is 1975, the setting is an obscure house in the Mississippi Delta. Its occupants are Jesse, a onetime blues legend, who has long been assumed dead, and his fugitive daughter Della. Their precarious peace is shattered by the arrival of Karl, a Surrey-based rock star whose band has been doing a gig in Memphis, Tennessee. Karl's mission is to woo the septuagenarian Jesse, whom he idolises, back into the limelight for one last stand. As a practised dramatist, Jeffreys understands the importance of desperation and he shrewdly parcels it out among his three characters. The pious Jesse, who after the death of his wife forsook the blues as the devil's music, is lured by the adrenaline buzz of live performance. Against that he has to balance Della's need for anonymity after her involvement with the Black Panthers. Even the Mephistophelian Karl, facing the break-up of his band, is torn between drug-dependence or a new partnership with a renascent Jesse. Jeffreys draws you into his story, deals his cards cleverly and even, boldly, gives Karl a chance to display his talents as a blues guitarist. But the play also raises disturbing questions about authenticity. Jesse eloquently argues that, unless you have known what it is to be black, poor and deprived, singing the blues is an adoptive attitude.

      "body": "<p>As offices across the land deck photocopiers with mistletoe and buy in emergency rations of Twiglets, you could be forgiven for believing every last desk in Britain has been transformed into a corporate wonderland of festive cheer. But you would be wrong. </p> <p>According to the latest statistics from the thinktank Labour Research, 30% of companies will this year offer no form of Christmas party or lunch whatsoever. And even at those firms that do offer festive events, there is clear evidence that many workers secretly resent the office do, seeing it as a form of enforced socialising. Research from recruitment consultancy Office Angels indicates that six out of 10 workers feel under pressure to attend out-of-hours events at Christmas, believing their careers could be hit if they stay away. </p> <p>In an era in which the boundary between work life and home life is growing vaguer by the day, many of us feel obliged to raise a festive glass with colleagues and clients. And we are not talking about just the one: on average, in the run-up to Christmas, we will spend a staggering (literally, in some cases) 45 hours socialising for work. According to this week's survey, most of us would rather spend that time at home. </p> <p>None of this should come as much of a surprise. There can be few things more irritating than having superiors standing over you monitoring a) what time you sneak off home b) whether you are having a good time and c) that you're not having such a good time that you actually do anything exciting. For something so purportedly laid- back, the office party can be a sublime exercise in workforce control. </p> <p>A ring around some of Britain's largest companies and government departments backs up this gloomy picture. Debenhams is having a free evening do at London nightclub Heaven, but NatWest is giving its branch managers party budgets, and while the Department of Culture is hosting a party for staff and spouses in the basement of its HQ, everyone will have to pay for the booze kitty. M&amp;S isn't having its do until mid-January, when 3,000 staff will have to shell out \u00a35 each if they want to roll up to London's Metropole Hotel. </p> <p>\"Many companies make assumptions about Christmas parties that do not at all reflect the way we live now,\" says Judith Doyle, cultural trends analyst for the Industrial Society. \"It's outdated and it's also assuming that we all wish to celebrate a Christian festival, which is not the case.\" </p> <p>In fact, Doyle argues, the 30% of non-partying companies are heralding the future. \"They're just reflecting the fact that Christmas is no longer the focal point of everyone's year. Some hi-tech companies in particular are choosing to skip the festive season, but offer bonuses or trips to Club Med in the summer. It depends what we think the purpose of the Christmas party is. As a reward, I don't think it really does it any more.\" </p> <p>One person well-versed in the cultural significance of office life is Matt Beaumont, until last year an account executive at ad agency McCann Erickson, now author of the bestselling novel e. His loathing of office parties is so extreme that it inspired his latest work, The e. Before Christmas, which chronicles the run-up to the annual party and its aftermath in the fictional Miller Shanks advertising agency. </p> <p>\"The last Christmas party I went to at work was so dreadful, I vowed never to go to another. That was years ago,\" he says. \"But whether or not you go, you are aware of the party aftermath and that's compelling. I used to sit there and watch people coming in looking ashamed, or talking about other people's shame. In fact, I used to get a buzz out of not going.\" </p> <p>What he misses most about office life, he says, is spending time with people he dislikes. \"Getting wound up by unpleasant people, that tension and energy, it's what keeps offices alive. The Christmas party is the culmination of all the crap that's built up all year; it can be very cathartic. Because of that, I think as long as there are offices, there will be office parties.\" </p> <p> This will come as bad news to weary veterans of old-style Christmas shindigs. There are some of us who have spent way too many Decembers being frogmarched to the ballrooms of naff city centre hotels to indulge in dubious finger buffets and toe-curling public humiliation of the death by karaoke variety. Some years ago, when I was editor of the trade magazine PR Week, I notched up 20 such functions in a month. The memory still makes me shudder. </p> <p>\"One reason people don't like office parties is that they simply don't know what to talk about,\" says Paul Jacobs, communications director at Office Angels. \"Work is often the only thing you've got in common, but suddenly you're supposed to make small talk. Many people find that a strain. And there's often a sense of anticipation about the event, which makes it more difficult to say no.\" </p> <p>There is another big stress factor involved, too. A party is no longer just a chance for workers to get down and boogie: managers are increasingly judging staff on their social skills. \"Personality is key nowadays,\" Doyle says. \"It's not about how well you do your job, it's about how well you laugh at the boss's jokes. There's a subtext going on in many offices: 'Promote me, I'm great fun.' Bosses want you to be one of their gang - in certain companies, you may be judged on how you perform at parties, even if you're an accountant.\" </p> <p>But could boycotting the office bash really harm your career? \"Of course not,\" says Garry Lace, managing director of ad agency TBWA. \"We're not going to be on the door taking a register. People do so much socialising for work now. If by mid- December they've run out of steam, that's perfectly understandable.\" </p> <p>It's unlikely any of TBWA's employees will be staying at home, though: no cheesy hotel disco for them. Staff will be taking over the Ministry of Sound for their White Christmas party. Invitations included a laminated William Hill betting slip with \u00a31 wagered on the seven to one odds of there being snow on the 25th. \"Even if people don't go, they still might win some money,\" Lace says. \"At the end of the day, a party is no substitute for a cash reward and companies who make that mistake are getting it wrong. It's good fun, but we wouldn't have one if we couldn't afford to pay our staff a bonus, too. That wouldn't be right.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The e.

      "body": "<p>This is supposed to be the Era of the Entrepreneur, a period in history when people strike out, take risks, ride the waves of the new economy. In the US, thousands of column inches have pondered the birth of a new America - the Free Agent Nation. And the UK is said to be following suit, with growing armies of freelancers - sorry, e-lancers - and swathes of start-ups. </p> <p>There is just one tiny snag: the numbers do not seem to add up. For all the hype, the number of people doing a Branson has not changed: in 1992 there were 3.2m people in Britain working for themselves; today there are ... 3.1m. The number of full-time teleworkers has also dropped slightly over the past decade, while figures just published in the US show the percentage of the labour force in self-employment dropping from 11% in 1994 to 10% last year. So on the face of it, all the claims about portfolio workers and free agents taking over the world look doubtful. </p> <p>But the figures can be viewed in a different way. Self-employed people fall into two camps: those who have chosen to work for themselves and those who have been forced to because no one else wants them. There's a cartoon in which a senior executive places his hand on an underling's shoulder and says: \"Congratulations, Mr Smith - you're about to become a free agent.\" Plenty of people who find themselves out of work have found consultancy a more socially acceptable activity than redundancy. </p> <p>By definition, people forced into self-employment are not free agents.

      "bodyText": "This is supposed to be the Era of the Entrepreneur, a period in history when people strike out, take risks, ride the waves of the new economy. In the US, thousands of column inches have pondered the birth of a new America - the Free Agent Nation. And the UK is said to be following suit, with growing armies of freelancers - sorry, e-lancers - and swathes of start-ups. There is just one tiny snag: the numbers do not seem to add up. For all the hype, the number of people doing a Branson has not changed: in 1992 there were 3.2m people in Britain working for themselves; today there are ... 3.1m. The number of full-time teleworkers has also dropped slightly over the past decade, while figures just published in the US show the percentage of the labour force in self-employment dropping from 11% in 1994 to 10% last year. So on the face of it, all the claims about portfolio workers and free agents taking over the world look doubtful. But the figures can be viewed in a different way. Self-employed people fall into two camps: those who have chosen to work for themselves and those who have been forced to because no one else wants them. There's a cartoon in which a senior executive places his hand on an underling's shoulder and says: \"Congratulations, Mr Smith - you're about to become a free agent.\" Plenty of people who find themselves out of work have found consultancy a more socially acceptable activity than redundancy. By definition, people forced into self-employment are not free agents. And when the economy rebounds, they are likely to try to land a \"real\" job as soon as possible. The US economy has just enjoyed nine years of growth, the longest period of expansion in its history; unemployment in many parts has virtually disappeared. So the reluctant consultants have come rushing back into the corporate fold. The ones who are left are the hard core, the true free agents - and there are still plenty of them.

      "body": "<p>BT has become the latest in a long line of companies entering the online energy supply market with the announcement today that Scottish and Southern Energy will be selling gas and electricity through BT's internet portal, BT Openworld. </p> <p>Existing energy companies and new entrants, such as BT and internet start-up Servista, see big money in the online energy market. Signing up and managing your account over the internet helps the companies cut costs which, they say, are passed on to you, the consumer.</p> <p>The idea of managing utilities online appeals to many, but the companies are finding it harder to convince the public of the relative merits of their particular service. All claim to have the cheapest service on the market: and clearly all can't be right. </p> <p>In addition, actually calculating your energy consumption and costs is a tricky business, leaving you to wade through different peak and off-peak times, different types of boiler and central heating systems, and different special offers. This makes bill comparisons with other energy suppliers very difficult. </p> <p>On top of this, customers who have switched energy suppliers since the market was deregulated - in 1998 for gas and last year for electricity - say the switch raised lots of problems. Incorrect billing, double billing and slow connections are among the more common complaints. In retrospect, many say they would rather have carried on paying a little more and not having the hassle. </p> <p>For customers to think changing is worthwhile, companies may have to offer something extra. Here, the internet start-ups such as Servista and Amerada may be able to steal a lead on their 'bricks and mortar' rivals. The two companies both offer a green alternative. </p> <p>For example, for as little as \u00a31.50 extra a month, customers can get their electricity from wind power. This is proving a popular service with Servista saying nearly one in five of its customers chooses the green option. In addition, some of the internet start-ups, Servista being one of them, are positioning themselves as a general supplier of household services. </p> <p>At present, the company can supply your phone and internet connection as well as your energy, sending you just one bill a month for all the services. It hopes this will prove popular with people who want to keep both a closer track on their finances and just have one regular bill for all their household needs.</p>",

      "bodyText": "BT has become the latest in a long line of companies entering the online energy supply market with the announcement today that Scottish and Southern Energy will be selling gas and electricity through BT's internet portal, BT Openworld. Existing energy companies and new entrants, such as BT and internet start-up Servista, see big money in the online energy market. Signing up and managing your account over the internet helps the companies cut costs which, they say, are passed on to you, the consumer. The idea of managing utilities online appeals to many, but the companies are finding it harder to convince the public of the relative merits of their particular service. All claim to have the cheapest service on the market: and clearly all can't be right. In addition, actually calculating your energy consumption and costs is a tricky business, leaving you to wade through different peak and off-peak times, different types of boiler and central heating systems, and different special offers. This makes bill comparisons with other energy suppliers very difficult. On top of this, customers who have switched energy suppliers since the market was deregulated - in 1998 for gas and last year for electricity - say the switch raised lots of problems. Incorrect billing, double billing and slow connections are among the more common complaints. In retrospect, many say they would rather have carried on paying a little more and not having the hassle. For customers to think changing is worthwhile, companies may have to offer something extra. Here, the internet start-ups such as Servista and Amerada may be able to steal a lead on their 'bricks and mortar' rivals. The two companies both offer a green alternative. For example, for as little as \u00a31.50 extra a month, customers can get their electricity from wind power. This is proving a popular service with Servista saying nearly one in five of its customers chooses the green option. In addition, some of the internet start-ups, Servista being one of them, are positioning themselves as a general supplier of household services. At present, the company can supply your phone and internet connection as well as your energy, sending you just one bill a month for all the services. It hopes this will prove popular with people who want to keep both a closer track on their finances and just have one regular bill for all their household needs.",

Non-internet communication with the banks is kept to a minimum. Telephone support is provided, but if you ask for information which is available on the internet you are likely to be charged - quite a lot in some cases. Items such as debit cards, cheque books and paying in slips are ordered online and sent to you by land mail. Because these banks have dramatically reduced their overheads by operating online, their interest rates are often better than those offered by the high street banks and they boast low or non-existent charges. The service offered by these banks varies. Some offer a whole range of banking services, from current accounts to savings accounts to loans. Others have a more limited product range. Egg, Smile, Cahoot, Intelligent Finance and First-E all fall into the standalone category.",

And with the introduction of Self Assessment, you could be paying even more. Simple planning could cut your tax bill. But how? And where do you start?</p> <p>Begin by checking your tax code. The Inland Revenue has been known to make mistakes and around one in 10 tax codes are incorrect, mostly because the Revenue has been given the wrong information. Take a closer look at your tax coding notice to ensure that it includes your personal allowances and any additional allowances you might be entitled to.</p> <p>The code is a shortened method of defining your total tax-free pay - usually the total of all your allowances, except that the last figure is omitted. For example, a code of 512H means that you start paying tax after you have earned \u00a35,120 and that you are married or entitled to additional personal allowances. In most cases, the higher your code, the lower your tax bill.</p> <p>The letter shown after your code defines your status. L, for example, means basic personal allowance entitlement, H means personal allowance plus married couple's allowance or additional personal allowance at basic rate, while D means you are taxed at the higher rate. The letters OT mean that no allowances have been given - probably because you haven't sent in a tax return for a long time or your tax affairs are very complicated. Sometimes your taxable benefits will exceed your allowances, an example being if you are taxed on a company car or owe back tax. In these cases, a K code is used so that your employer can recoup this tax on behalf of the Revenue.</p> <p>You need to check the figures on your notice of tax code very carefully. If the estimates are excessive, write to your tax office requesting a code change. And if your code is incorrect, it is more than likely that your previous year's code was wrong too.</p> <p>Make the best use of your tax-free personal allowances. This is particularly relevant if you are married and you and your spouse pay different rates of tax. If, for example one of you is a top-rate taxpayer and the other a basic rate or non-taxpayer, you can cut your tax liability in half by transferring income-yielding assets like building society deposits or shares to the lower earner.</p> <p>Rental income on property can also be split between you and your spouse in proportions that minimise tax liability, but the Inland Revenue must be informed in a notice of \"declaration of beneficial interest in joint property and income\" or via form IR17 if you don't fancy getting your tongue around that lot.</p> <p>There are pitfalls to all this money juggling. If you change the name on a building society account you could forfeit the right to future windfall bonuses from demutualising societies. And of course, if your spouse runs off with the money all the tax efficiency in the world won\u00b9t get it back.</p> <p>We might enjoy badmouthing Hector the taxman, but to be fair to the guy he does offer taxpayers several other allowances which sometimes get overlooked. For example, if you have kids, are you ensuring that your children's tax-free personal allowances are being used to the full? Are they needlessly paying tax on bank and building society deposits because you've forgotten to fill in tax form R85?</p> <p>And at work, are there any expenses you could set against tax such as training, fees to professional bodies or travelling costs? Are your donations to charities benefiting from tax relief via the Gift Aid scheme or deeds of covenant?</p> <p>Make the most of your pension. It's common knowledge that pensions are the most tax efficient investments around, but are you making the most of yours?</p> <p>If you are in a company scheme you can salt away up to 15% of your earnings from your job into your pension and get tax relief at your highest rate. If your employer's scheme is non-contributory, you can make up the shortfall by making additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) to your company scheme or free-standing additional voluntary contributions (FSAVCs) to a personal free-standing AVC scheme of your choice.</p> <p>If you have a personal pension instead, the taxman will also limit the amount of pension contributions you can make which will qualify for tax relief. These limits vary according to your age and the type of personal plan you have, but they are set as a percentage of your net relevant earnings. For the self-employed this basically means your profits before tax. If you are under the age of 35, for example, the most you can pay into a personal pension in any one tax year is 17.5% of net relevant earnings.</p> <p>However, there are a couple of rules which permit you to make contributions which come to more than your particular limit for a particular tax year. Under carry-back provisions, you can make a contribution in one tax year, but have it treated as if it had been paid in the previous year. Of course, you have to have enough unused tax relief from the previous year, but if you had no net relevant earnings in the previous year, you can even carry the contribution back two years.</p> <p>Carrying back contributions can be particularly useful if you are self-employed, because the delay in making pension contributions for a particular year gives you time to make up your accounts for that year and assess your tax position.</p> <p>The other way to contribute more into your personal pension than the current year limits allow is to carry forward - the rules allow you to do this if you have any unused tax-relief limit from the last six years. You can carry forward the unused relief and use it now.</p>",

Rental income on property can also be split between you and your spouse in proportions that minimise tax liability, but the Inland Revenue must be informed in a notice of \"declaration of beneficial interest in joint property and income\" or via form IR17 if you don't fancy getting your tongue around that lot. There are pitfalls to all this money juggling. If you change the name on a building society account you could forfeit the right to future windfall bonuses from demutualising societies. And of course, if your spouse runs off with the money all the tax efficiency in the world won\u00b9t get it back. We might enjoy badmouthing Hector the taxman, but to be fair to the guy he does offer taxpayers several other allowances which sometimes get overlooked. For example, if you have kids, are you ensuring that your children's tax-free personal allowances are being used to the full? Are they needlessly paying tax on bank and building society deposits because you've forgotten to fill in tax form R85? And at work, are there any expenses you could set against tax such as training, fees to professional bodies or travelling costs? Are your donations to charities benefiting from tax relief via the Gift Aid scheme or deeds of covenant? Make the most of your pension. It's common knowledge that pensions are the most tax efficient investments around, but are you making the most of yours? If you are in a company scheme you can salt away up to 15% of your earnings from your job into your pension and get tax relief at your highest rate. If your employer's scheme is non-contributory, you can make up the shortfall by making additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) to your company scheme or free-standing additional voluntary contributions (FSAVCs) to a personal free-standing AVC scheme of your choice. If you have a personal pension instead, the taxman will also limit the amount of pension contributions you can make which will qualify for tax relief. These limits vary according to your age and the type of personal plan you have, but they are set as a percentage of your net relevant earnings. For the self-employed this basically means your profits before tax. If you are under the age of 35, for example, the most you can pay into a personal pension in any one tax year is 17.5% of net relevant earnings. However, there are a couple of rules which permit you to make contributions which come to more than your particular limit for a particular tax year. Under carry-back provisions, you can make a contribution in one tax year, but have it treated as if it had been paid in the previous year. Of course, you have to have enough unused tax relief from the previous year, but if you had no net relevant earnings in the previous year, you can even carry the contribution back two years. Carrying back contributions can be particularly useful if you are self-employed, because the delay in making pension contributions for a particular year gives you time to make up your accounts for that year and assess your tax position. The other way to contribute more into your personal pension than the current year limits allow is to carry forward - the rules allow you to do this if you have any unused tax-relief limit from the last six years. You can carry forward the unused relief and use it now.",

The volume and length of each note is up to the individual player. To what extent, then, can such a work be said to be Cage's own composition?
