Subs: Ovchinnikov, Aloisio, Deco, Drulovic, Chainho, Nuno, Maric.<br> <strong>Referee:</strong> Kim Nielsen </p> <p><strong>1</strong> Liverpool kick off. A big test for the Reds, who must really look to win this tie tonight. With this in mind, it seems that Vladimir Smicer is playing further forward, and more centrally, than usual.<br> <strong>2</strong> Pena, the touted Brazilian striker, is already looking more lively in this second leg than he did in the first. On this occasion he breaks free from two Liverpool defenders in the box, but is pulled back by an offside flag.<br> <strong>4</strong> Brave running and jostling by Michael Owen wins Liverpool the first corner of the match. But a poor delivery from Smicer only results in a throw-in. <br> <strong>5</strong> Sami Hyypia clatters into Pena just outside of the centre circle. An unnecessary challenge and one that perhaps should have earned Hyypia a yellow card.<br> <strong>9</strong> Liverpool are temporarily down to 10 men whil Steven Gerrard goes off to change his boots.<br> <strong>10</strong> Liverpool enjoy prolonged possession around the Porto box, without acheiving much penetration. A deflected cross from Smicer finally results in a corner for the Reds, but it comes to nothing.<br> <strong>11</strong> Owen gets the ball out wide and jinks his way past two defenders on the left-hand side. But his final effort, neither shot nor cross, is rather disappointing.<br> <strong>13</strong> Again Owen is on the ball, this time just inside the Porto half, but is scythed down by Claudio Santos. <strong>Yellow card</strong><br> <strong>14</strong> Porto's first attack on the counter, is well-crafted by Dmitri Alenitchev. With Clayton and Pena in front of him, the Russian picks out the latter, who can only scuff the ball.<br> <strong>15</strong> The first real save of the game is forced by Steven Gerrard with one of his increasingly characteristic 30-yard drives. Espinha does well to tip over the shot, which was dipping just under the bar.<br> <strong>18</strong> Liverpool continue to maintain good possession without unduly troubling the Porto defence. With Smicer pushed forward, there is little width to the Liverpool attacks, something their fullbacks may have to remedy.<br> <strong>20</strong> Either that, or get Owen to do it. The England man skins Secretario for the second time this evening, and this time Santos does well to cut out the cross.<br> <strong>21</strong> Again Pena receives the ball in the Liverpool area, and again his contribution leaves something to be desired. Porto do eventually get a corner out of it however, which Alenitchev duly hits straight against Robbie Fowler.<br> <strong>24</strong> Babbel wins Liverpool another corner. Taken this time by Danny Murphy the ball flies much deeper and ends with a scrabble in the Porto box, which Santos duly clears.<br> <strong>25</strong> Owen beats Secretario once more and this time is hacked down by the veteran full-back. Secretario then chooses to roll around on the ground. But not only does he not avoid the inevitable <strong>yellow card</strong> referee Neilsen also initially refuses to stop play for him to receive treatment. The result is a stand-off lasting nigh-on five minutes.<br> <strong>29</strong> Finally the free-kick is taken and headed out for a corner by Andrade.

      "bodyText": "Liverpool: Westerveld, Babbel, Henchoz, Hyypia, Carragher, Hamann, Gerrard, Murphy, Smicer, Owen, Fowler. Subs: Ziege, Heskey, Arphexad, McAllister, Diomede, Wright, Litmanen. FC Porto: Espinha, Alves, Paredes, Secretario, Andrade, Alenitchev, Santos, Candido Costa, Clayton, Pena, Silva. Subs: Ovchinnikov, Aloisio, Deco, Drulovic, Chainho, Nuno, Maric. Referee: Kim Nielsen 1 Liverpool kick off. A big test for the Reds, who must really look to win this tie tonight. With this in mind, it seems that Vladimir Smicer is playing further forward, and more centrally, than usual. 2 Pena, the touted Brazilian striker, is already looking more lively in this second leg than he did in the first. On this occasion he breaks free from two Liverpool defenders in the box, but is pulled back by an offside flag. 4 Brave running and jostling by Michael Owen wins Liverpool the first corner of the match. But a poor delivery from Smicer only results in a throw-in. 5 Sami Hyypia clatters into Pena just outside of the centre circle. An unnecessary challenge and one that perhaps should have earned Hyypia a yellow card. 9 Liverpool are temporarily down to 10 men whil Steven Gerrard goes off to change his boots. 10 Liverpool enjoy prolonged possession around the Porto box, without acheiving much penetration. A deflected cross from Smicer finally results in a corner for the Reds, but it comes to nothing. 11 Owen gets the ball out wide and jinks his way past two defenders on the left-hand side. But his final effort, neither shot nor cross, is rather disappointing. 13 Again Owen is on the ball, this time just inside the Porto half, but is scythed down by Claudio Santos. Yellow card 14 Porto's first attack on the counter, is well-crafted by Dmitri Alenitchev. With Clayton and Pena in front of him, the Russian picks out the latter, who can only scuff the ball. 15 The first real save of the game is forced by Steven Gerrard with one of his increasingly characteristic 30-yard drives. Espinha does well to tip over the shot, which was dipping just under the bar. 18 Liverpool continue to maintain good possession without unduly troubling the Porto defence. With Smicer pushed forward, there is little width to the Liverpool attacks, something their fullbacks may have to remedy. 20 Either that, or get Owen to do it. The England man skins Secretario for the second time this evening, and this time Santos does well to cut out the cross. 21 Again Pena receives the ball in the Liverpool area, and again his contribution leaves something to be desired. Porto do eventually get a corner out of it however, which Alenitchev duly hits straight against Robbie Fowler. 24 Babbel wins Liverpool another corner. Taken this time by Danny Murphy the ball flies much deeper and ends with a scrabble in the Porto box, which Santos duly clears. 25 Owen beats Secretario once more and this time is hacked down by the veteran full-back. Secretario then chooses to roll around on the ground. But not only does he not avoid the inevitable yellow card referee Neilsen also initially refuses to stop play for him to receive treatment. The result is a stand-off lasting nigh-on five minutes. 29 Finally the free-kick is taken and headed out for a corner by Andrade. Secretario hobbles his way back onto the pitch seconds later. 30 Another scramble in the Porto box. This time, Murphy hooks the ball over the head of a defender and onto Owen, whose well-intended hook shot ends up flying straight into the arms of Espinha. 31 GOAL! Liverpool 1- 0 Porto Markus Babbel, who has been getting further forward in the past 10 minutes, wins the ball from Fernando Nelson. He loops it back to Gerrard, who hits a phenomenal first time cross to Murphy on the left hand side of the box. Murphy controls the ball with both knee and hand but, without the referee blowing. then volleys the ball just inside the far post. 34 Now Porto will be forced to come out and play. And play they do, with Clayton almost equalising straight away. But his low shot from 18 yards is scrambled away by Sander Westerveld. 36 GOAL! Liverpool 2 - 0 Porto Michael Owen gets his reward for an impressive first half, and puts Liverpool in a comfortable position. Another corner is fed back to Steven Gerrard, who hits another great cross which Owen meets with a downward header that flummoxes the less-than impressive Espinha and loops under the post. 41 A half-chance for the visitors is wasted by Santos, whose volley spoons over the bar after Pena chested the ball into his path. 45 With the Porto defence looking increasingly uncertain both Smicer and Gerrard look to take on the entire back line. But while Smicer's run ends in a pull-back which just only evades Owen, Gerrard's ends in a wild two-footed challenge and a yellow card. 47 Nearly another goal for Liverpool and Owen, as the Porto defence continues to unravel. This time Murphy finds Owen in undue amounts of space on the left-hand side of the box.

Babbel is fouled by Nelson, and from the subsequent Gerrad free-kick only fails by inches to connect with a header. 78 Jari Litmanen, after giving away possession outside his own area, wins it back and clears the ball 60 yards into the path of Heskey.

      "bodyText": "DOWNING Street went on the offensive last night against intrusive prying into the personal lives of politicians as the Cabinet rallied to Agriculture Minister Nick Brown , who was forced to reveal his homosexuality. The Prime Minister fears that Mr Brown's disclosure that he is gay could set off a further media feeding frenzy of inquiries into the private lives of ministers and seriously distract attention from the Government's legislative programme. Tony Blair's official spokesman, battling to turn the tide on a fortnight of personal revelations about cabinet members, insisted the climate was changing and the public was 'becoming sick of the media in the way they are prying into people's public lives'. The Government had been braced for hostile stories about ministers after enjoying almost 18 months free from the kind of scandals that routinely disrupted John Major's premiership. Last month Mr Blair fired a prescient warning shot in his Blackpool conference speech, when he said of his commitment to strengthening the family: 'I challenge the media: don't use it as an excuse to dredge through the private lives of every public figure.' Mr Brown, aged 48, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne East, who admitted to having had a two-year affair with a young man, echoed the sentiments yesterday, saying: 'I had rather hoped I could have a private life like other people do, that was private. 'What's happened is enormously embarrassing for me, certainly, and I'm sad that my family, my friends, my constituents, have all had to read today's press. I've got a very important job to do and I'm going to get on with it.' But in a pooled interview, conducted by the BBC, he refused to be drawn on whether resignation had been mentioned during his weekend discussions with the Prime Minister. Friends said part of the reason for his embarrassment and anger was that he had not told his mother, who is seriously ill, about his sexuality. The disclosure follows the resignation of the Welsh Secretary, Ron Davies, after his nocturnal visit to Clapham Common, and the 'outing' of the Trade and Industry Secretary, Peter Mandelson, on BBC TV's Newsnight. Downing Street, heavily criticised for its handling of the Davies affair, reacted quickly, when it became apparent the News of the World was preparing to run its story about Mr Brown. It issued statements from Mr Blair and Mr Brown at 9.40pm on Saturday after Mr Brown's former partner allegedly tried to sell a story about their relationship to the News of the World . Mr Brown, a former Chief Whip, denied he had paid for sex, only helping him out with taxi fares of around pounds 20 and a handout of pounds 80. The News Of The World editor, Phil Hall, said the paper had approached Downing Street 'after a young man gave us an unsubstantiated account of a relationship' with Nick Brown . 'Mr Brown then volunteered a statement which we have published in full. We have not published the young man's account in any form.' But Downing Street described the News of the World as disingenuous and said it had been tracking Mr Brown for two years. 'They put specific and unpleasant allegations to Nick and he felt the best thing to do was to confirm some and deny others,' a spokesman said. He added that attempts had been made at entrapment. The young man had been phoning Mr Brown 'to try to get stuff on tape. Nick had sensed something was up.' Downing Street and Mr Brown hope they can bring the issue to a close quickly. Mr Brown may be helped by his popularity among fellow MPs at Westminster. The Conservatives decided not to make capital out of his embarrassment. Mr Brown, crucially, also has the backing of his local constituency party. The Defence Secretary, George Robertson, echoing an increasing view among ministers, said: 'What people do in their private lives, as long as it doesn't affect others, is a matter for them, and I think that's the view of the vast majority of the British people.' Mr Brown cancelled his attendance along with other cabinet colleagues at the Remembrance Day service at the Cenotaph yesterday morning, citing his fear that the solemn occasion could have turned into a media scrum.",

Brian Oakley was discovered by his wife Gillian.</p> <p>Although father-of-two Mr Oakley, 54, had suffered from depression for several years, friends said the foot and mouth outbreak, which had made him a prisoner at his 26-acre Bryn Coch holding, had tipped him over the edge.</p> <p>Clifford Evans, a fellow farmer and founder of the Shropshire Rural Stress Network, said: \"Brian had not been well and he needed to get out and see the family and meet farmers at the market. He felt trapped at home.</p> <p>\"His sheep were lambing, were short of grass, and he was worried he could not move them. This was the last straw for him and after struggling for ages, when foot and mouth arrived, with all the restrictions it just got on top of him.\"</p> <p>Samaritans in north east Wales have seen calls from farmers increase by 50% over the past few weeks at their centre in Rhyl.</p> <p>Yesterday saw the virus spread to a new county, Cheshire, as well as fresh outbreaks in Cumbria, Berkshire and Essex.</p> <p>The total of 230 cases brings the number of animals to be destroyed close to 200,000 but many more may be culled if the government decides to press ahead with even more radical attempts to eradicate the disease. A programme to kill all animals that may have had any contact with markets where the disease existed or were carried in infected vehicles is being considered.</p> <p>With the losses to tourism and countryside activities suspended there is pressure in Whitehall to reduce restrictions in areas currently free from infection. The northern two thirds of Scotland, most of East Anglia and west Wales, all key holiday areas, could be designated for this purpose.</p> <p>Jim Scudamore, the chief vet, is known to be reluctant to do this unless he can be sure that there are no potentially infected animals in these areas.

      "bodyText": "The foot and mouth crisis claimed its first human victim as a huge rise of 25 new cases - equal to the highest daily total on Monday - was confirmed yesterday. The worsening crisis was blamed for the death of a Welsh farmer found hanging at his farm in Llanfechainn, Powys, near the Shropshire border. Brian Oakley was discovered by his wife Gillian. Although father-of-two Mr Oakley, 54, had suffered from depression for several years, friends said the foot and mouth outbreak, which had made him a prisoner at his 26-acre Bryn Coch holding, had tipped him over the edge. Clifford Evans, a fellow farmer and founder of the Shropshire Rural Stress Network, said: \"Brian had not been well and he needed to get out and see the family and meet farmers at the market. He felt trapped at home. \"His sheep were lambing, were short of grass, and he was worried he could not move them. This was the last straw for him and after struggling for ages, when foot and mouth arrived, with all the restrictions it just got on top of him.\" Samaritans in north east Wales have seen calls from farmers increase by 50% over the past few weeks at their centre in Rhyl. Yesterday saw the virus spread to a new county, Cheshire, as well as fresh outbreaks in Cumbria, Berkshire and Essex. The total of 230 cases brings the number of animals to be destroyed close to 200,000 but many more may be culled if the government decides to press ahead with even more radical attempts to eradicate the disease. A programme to kill all animals that may have had any contact with markets where the disease existed or were carried in infected vehicles is being considered. With the losses to tourism and countryside activities suspended there is pressure in Whitehall to reduce restrictions in areas currently free from infection. The northern two thirds of Scotland, most of East Anglia and west Wales, all key holiday areas, could be designated for this purpose. Jim Scudamore, the chief vet, is known to be reluctant to do this unless he can be sure that there are no potentially infected animals in these areas. The government is considering a scheme of sending suspect animals to designated abattoirs for slaughter, and then putting their carcasses in cold store, so they can be destroyed in rendering plants once the outbreak is over and the pressure to dispose of infected animals has eased. Mr Scudamore said he was concerned that thousands of animals from the Welshpool and Northampton markets which may have been infected had still not been traced. Tony Blair in the Commons said that it would be right to intensify the slaughter of animals not suffering from the disease but which had come into contact with those that had. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, will make a statement to MPs today. The rural task force, chaired by the environment minister, Michael Meacher, met yesterday to try to restore confidence in the tourist industry. The group wants to identify areas of the country that can be safely visited and to look for short-term practical help for rural business. What's going on?

Ministers close to him fear the public mood could swing against the government if it was thought they were arrogantly overriding the sombre mood in the countryside.</p> <p>The spread of the foot and mouth outbreaks continued yesterday, reaching Cheshire for the first time, and leading the government to consider a larger cull of animals.</p> <p>With 230 confirmed cases - including 25 new ones yesterday, equal to the highest daily total so far - the number of animals being destroyed reached almost 200,000.</p> <p>Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, is to make a Commons statement today on new moves for destroying animals which may have come into contact with the disease.</p> <p>The worsening crisis was also blamed for the death of a Welsh farmer found hanging at his home near the Shropshire border. Brian Oakley was discovered at his farm in Llanfechainn, Powys, by his wife..</p> <p>A Guardian survey yesterday of the 28 Labour MPs with more than a thousand farmers and farmworkers in their constituency revealed divisions about the timing of an election.</p> <p>A majority warned that Tony Blair may have to drop the poll within a fortnight if the number of cases grows. Most claimed that the poll could go ahead, but only if the outbreak did not worsen between now and the end of this month.</p> <p>Russell Brown, Labour MP for Dumfries,who has 28 cases in his constituency, said: \"If we are not on top of this in the next fortnight, I would be pressing for a delay in the election.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown, Labour's chief general election strategist, has told colleagues that the decision on whether to go ahead with the poll on May 3 is now on a knife edge. His remarks to close ministerial allies on Tuesday counter the public reassurances from Downing Street yesterday that the foot and mouth outbreak will not affect Tony Blair's thinking on the poll date or cause a deferral of the county council elections. Mr Brown is said to be concerned that the electorate would not understand why Labour was pressing ahead with an election a year before it had to, if the crisis worsened. Ministers close to him fear the public mood could swing against the government if it was thought they were arrogantly overriding the sombre mood in the countryside. The spread of the foot and mouth outbreaks continued yesterday, reaching Cheshire for the first time, and leading the government to consider a larger cull of animals. With 230 confirmed cases - including 25 new ones yesterday, equal to the highest daily total so far - the number of animals being destroyed reached almost 200,000. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, is to make a Commons statement today on new moves for destroying animals which may have come into contact with the disease. The worsening crisis was also blamed for the death of a Welsh farmer found hanging at his home near the Shropshire border. Brian Oakley was discovered at his farm in Llanfechainn, Powys, by his wife.. A Guardian survey yesterday of the 28 Labour MPs with more than a thousand farmers and farmworkers in their constituency revealed divisions about the timing of an election. A majority warned that Tony Blair may have to drop the poll within a fortnight if the number of cases grows. Most claimed that the poll could go ahead, but only if the outbreak did not worsen between now and the end of this month. Russell Brown, Labour MP for Dumfries,who has 28 cases in his constituency, said: \"If we are not on top of this in the next fortnight, I would be pressing for a delay in the election. I believe in free and fair and open elections and that includes MPs being able to get to every part of their constituency this week\". Peter Bradley, chairman of the rural group of Labour MPs, called on the government to conduct \"an immediate review of the numbers of people who would be disadvantaged were there to be a general election on May 3\". Diana Organ, whose Forest of Dean constituency has four outbreaks of the disease and is facing a severe fall in tourism, said: \"It is a bit like saying, do you have granny's funeral and then hold daughter's wedding the day after.\" The prime minister's spokesman tried to kill off mounting speculation by saying that postponement of the county council elections would damage rural tourism and feed a worldwide impression that the British countryside was a no-go area. But the pressure to delay grew yesterday when the Countryside Alliance and the National Farmers' Union insisted that an election in the current crisis would be an insult to the countryside and democracy. The Conservatives refused to call openly for delay, but are privately praying for postponement. The Liberal Democrats are internally divided on the issue. What's going on?

For all of us who have seen the devastating social effects of unemployment it is a crusade.</p> <p>\"As someone put it, I want every child in every part of Britain as they get up for school every morning to see a whole community around them getting up and going to work.\"</p> <p>Ministers have been impressed by the results achieved by some of the existing 38 action teams for jobs, including one in Hartlepool where more than 50% of the people seen have been helped into employment. The teams give counselling to a wide range of benefits recipients, not just those on jobseekers' allowance.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Education and Employment said seven teams were being created in Islington, north London, Hull, Newcastle upon Tyne, Salford, Dundee, North Lanarkshire and Halton. Mr Brown said these would bolster his plans, announced in the Budget, to offer new tax incentives to business to invest in the poorest areas.</p> <p>The government also announced \u00a340m of new funding to help the disabled to find work, another \u00a335m to target those who are not yet equipped to enter the labour market, such as people with behavioural difficulties, and it took the first steps towards a merger of the employment service and benefits agency by saying it would set up 50 experimental one-stop shops for benefit claimants.</p> <p>Theresa May, shadow education and employment secretary, dismissed the New Deal as \"the most expensive job creation scheme in history\". She said the Conservatives would replace it and offer private sector companies a \"bounty\" of around \u00a31,500 for placing a jobless person in work, to be doubled to \u00a33,000 if they remained in the post long-term. This compared favourably with the \u00a320,000 cost of each job found by the New Deal for Young People.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government took the next step towards achieving its goal of full employment yesterday by announcing an extension of the New Deal, involving spending an extra \u00a3120m on creating seven teams of troubleshooters to target unemployment blackspots. As ministers celebrated un employment falling below 1m for the first time in more than 25 years, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, pledged there would be no relaxation of the government's efforts to get people off welfare and into work. Having helped to get 270,000 young people into jobs since its launch 1998, the second stage of the New Deal would focus on coaching the hard to employ, and sector by sector initiatives to meet Britain's long-term skills needs, Mr Brown said. He was speaking at a press conference at the Industrial Society in London which was also attended by the prime minister, the education and employment secretary, David Blunkett, and the social security secretary, Alistair Darling. Mr Brown said: \"Full employment is not just an economic cause that will make the economy more efficient. For all of us who have seen the devastating social effects of unemployment it is a crusade. \"As someone put it, I want every child in every part of Britain as they get up for school every morning to see a whole community around them getting up and going to work.\" Ministers have been impressed by the results achieved by some of the existing 38 action teams for jobs, including one in Hartlepool where more than 50% of the people seen have been helped into employment. The teams give counselling to a wide range of benefits recipients, not just those on jobseekers' allowance. A spokesman for the Department for Education and Employment said seven teams were being created in Islington, north London, Hull, Newcastle upon Tyne, Salford, Dundee, North Lanarkshire and Halton. Mr Brown said these would bolster his plans, announced in the Budget, to offer new tax incentives to business to invest in the poorest areas. The government also announced \u00a340m of new funding to help the disabled to find work, another \u00a335m to target those who are not yet equipped to enter the labour market, such as people with behavioural difficulties, and it took the first steps towards a merger of the employment service and benefits agency by saying it would set up 50 experimental one-stop shops for benefit claimants. Theresa May, shadow education and employment secretary, dismissed the New Deal as \"the most expensive job creation scheme in history\". She said the Conservatives would replace it and offer private sector companies a \"bounty\" of around \u00a31,500 for placing a jobless person in work, to be doubled to \u00a33,000 if they remained in the post long-term. This compared favourably with the \u00a320,000 cost of each job found by the New Deal for Young People.",

A wit in the audience helpfully suggested that in today's climate, if anybody in the industry needs money, an appointment to see Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority, would be the best solution. But, of course, it would not.</p> <p>Sir Alastair's new strategic agenda for the railway was published this week. It may look impressive - a \u00a360bn investment over the next 10 years - but it is a grand deception which has to be set against hard reality.</p> <p>Sir Alastair is prevented from offering help to Railtrack on maintenance although he might be able to oblige on improving the system. As a private company, Railtrack is supposed to be big enough to look after itself, but clearly cannot. Worsening financial problems beckon unless the Treasury doctor applies a bandage to its gaping wounds.</p> <p>Sir Alastair's \u00a360bn is a recapitulation of the government's promise made last summer to spend this amount of money on rail over the next decade. But only half, probably less, is due to come from the taxpayer. The rest will come from the private sector, inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit of the industry, and possibly overhopeful assurances from the SRA that passenger numbers are expected to soar by 50% over the same period.</p> <p>Around \u00a315bn of the total has already been sanctioned by the rail regulator for Railtrack to spend over the next five years as part of its development programme. But no sooner has the ink dried on the agreement than along comes Mr Marshall asking for an extra \u00a31bn - or is it \u00a31.5bn? The official numbers keep on changing.</p> <p>This week's presentation by the SRA has been disappointing, considering it has been the government's only big idea for rail since privatisation. It is supposed to produce a panacea for the industry, a strategy to lock in the expansion of rail and to encourage the train companies to provide better services for the public. Yet the strategy has so far not got off the starting blocks.</p> <p>In effect, the strategy has been delayed for almost 12 months. Sir Alastair has produced several excuses, among them the Hatfield rail crash and Railtrack's negotiations with the regulator. We will now have wait until the autumn for the strategy, a move which cannot come too soon for the train companies who want to invest for a further 20 years with new contracts.</p> <p>The SRA's lack of leadership has been a serious disappointment to ministers. Sir Alastair had been recruited by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, as a person who could get things done. His critics say that his lofty aspirations are one thing, but that he has failed to become involved in issues which directly affect passengers, like fares and overcrowding, where he could have made an immediate impact.</p> <p>Ministers have begun a whispering campaign against Sir Alastair and his chief lieutenant, Mike Grant. Both men have another year of their contract to run, and once the election is over could be conveniently removed from their jobs having finally produced their strategy and departed with the grateful thanks of the government ringing in their ears.</p> <p>Sir Alastair denies that he has any problems with the government and that the only reason for his departure would be because of \"hard work\". But it is a dirty business, made more so by the fact that government sources are already circulating the names of possible candidates.</p> <p>The SRA's glossy booklet is full of aspirations. It carries a long list of potential schemes including a new railway under London. But these are mere ideas, dependent on somebody, almost certainly from the private sector, coming forward in support.</p> <p>Almost two years into its life the SRA cannot even claim to have negotiated new rail franchises. Admittedly, it has booted out Connex, the French-owned group, which operates one of the largest London suburban franchises, but has not been able to sign a deal with the new company. In the meantime, passengers continue to grumble about the poor quality of the Connex product.</p> <p>By now, Sir Alastair should have been able to announce the successful bidder for the south-west trains franchise, but like all decisions at the SRA these days, it is still delayed.</p> <p>His worst moment was a decision to overrule a recommendation that a bid by Stagecoach-Virgin to operate the east coast main line with a new franchise gave \"value for money\". Part of the Virgin bid was a new dedicated 120 mile track from Yorkshire to the outskirts of London. Yet another decision that will have to wait till after the election.</p> <p>Above all, Sir Alastair has had to contend with the Treasury. Its control over his domain is almost as tight as it was in the old days of British Rail. Much of the \u00a33bn a year coming direct from Gordon Brown until 2009 is going straight to Railtrack. Some will have to go on subsidies to rail companies, leaving very little for grand plans.</p> <p>Keith Harper is the Guardian's transport editor.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:keith.harper@theguardian.com\">keith.harper@theguardian.com </a></p>",

But, of course, it would not. Sir Alastair's new strategic agenda for the railway was published this week. It may look impressive - a \u00a360bn investment over the next 10 years - but it is a grand deception which has to be set against hard reality. Sir Alastair is prevented from offering help to Railtrack on maintenance although he might be able to oblige on improving the system. As a private company, Railtrack is supposed to be big enough to look after itself, but clearly cannot. Worsening financial problems beckon unless the Treasury doctor applies a bandage to its gaping wounds. Sir Alastair's \u00a360bn is a recapitulation of the government's promise made last summer to spend this amount of money on rail over the next decade. But only half, probably less, is due to come from the taxpayer. The rest will come from the private sector, inspired by the entrepreneurial spirit of the industry, and possibly overhopeful assurances from the SRA that passenger numbers are expected to soar by 50% over the same period. Around \u00a315bn of the total has already been sanctioned by the rail regulator for Railtrack to spend over the next five years as part of its development programme. But no sooner has the ink dried on the agreement than along comes Mr Marshall asking for an extra \u00a31bn - or is it \u00a31.5bn? The official numbers keep on changing. This week's presentation by the SRA has been disappointing, considering it has been the government's only big idea for rail since privatisation. It is supposed to produce a panacea for the industry, a strategy to lock in the expansion of rail and to encourage the train companies to provide better services for the public. Yet the strategy has so far not got off the starting blocks. In effect, the strategy has been delayed for almost 12 months. Sir Alastair has produced several excuses, among them the Hatfield rail crash and Railtrack's negotiations with the regulator. We will now have wait until the autumn for the strategy, a move which cannot come too soon for the train companies who want to invest for a further 20 years with new contracts. The SRA's lack of leadership has been a serious disappointment to ministers. Sir Alastair had been recruited by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, as a person who could get things done. His critics say that his lofty aspirations are one thing, but that he has failed to become involved in issues which directly affect passengers, like fares and overcrowding, where he could have made an immediate impact. Ministers have begun a whispering campaign against Sir Alastair and his chief lieutenant, Mike Grant. Both men have another year of their contract to run, and once the election is over could be conveniently removed from their jobs having finally produced their strategy and departed with the grateful thanks of the government ringing in their ears. Sir Alastair denies that he has any problems with the government and that the only reason for his departure would be because of \"hard work\". But it is a dirty business, made more so by the fact that government sources are already circulating the names of possible candidates. The SRA's glossy booklet is full of aspirations. It carries a long list of potential schemes including a new railway under London. But these are mere ideas, dependent on somebody, almost certainly from the private sector, coming forward in support. Almost two years into its life the SRA cannot even claim to have negotiated new rail franchises. Admittedly, it has booted out Connex, the French-owned group, which operates one of the largest London suburban franchises, but has not been able to sign a deal with the new company. In the meantime, passengers continue to grumble about the poor quality of the Connex product. By now, Sir Alastair should have been able to announce the successful bidder for the south-west trains franchise, but like all decisions at the SRA these days, it is still delayed. His worst moment was a decision to overrule a recommendation that a bid by Stagecoach-Virgin to operate the east coast main line with a new franchise gave \"value for money\". Part of the Virgin bid was a new dedicated 120 mile track from Yorkshire to the outskirts of London. Yet another decision that will have to wait till after the election. Above all, Sir Alastair has had to contend with the Treasury. Its control over his domain is almost as tight as it was in the old days of British Rail. Much of the \u00a33bn a year coming direct from Gordon Brown until 2009 is going straight to Railtrack. Some will have to go on subsidies to rail companies, leaving very little for grand plans.

      "body": "<p>By the stern rules of her profession, Monica Jones, who has died aged 78, should perish. An academic for four decades, she published nothing. Yet she merits commemoration on two grounds: she was the career-long companion and aide (occasionally muse) of Britain's most acclaimed postwar poet, Philip Larkin. She was also, in her own idiosyncratic style, an outstanding teacher.</p> <p>Born in Llanelli, an only child, her father was an engineer; her mother was from the north-east of England. When Monica was seven, the Jones family moved to Stourport-on-Severn, Worcestershire. Her parents (at a period well before the 1944 Education Act) arranged for her to go to the girls' high school at Kidderminster. From there she won a scholarship and went up to St Hugh's College, Oxford, in October 1940, to read English. She was the first member of her immediate family to go to university.</p> <p>Wartime Oxford left an indelible mark on Jones. Her distinctive accent and abrupt manner of speech were evidently acquired in these three years. Throughout life she would give herself (as during the dark days of the early 1940s) regular \"holidays\" from reading the newspapers (that meant cancelling the Telegraph). Drab \"utility\" uniformity inspired her - as an act of resistance - to a flamboyant extravagance in dress (her mini-skirts in the 1960s were shorter than those of many of her women pupils). Food rationing induced a lifelong detestation of tinned milk and margarine.</p> <p>Oxford, depopulated of its able-bodied male population (which did not include her then unknown contemporary, Philip Larkin, at St John's), fitted Jones for the role (or at least the outward appearance) of a Zuleika Dobson, 1940s-style. She had fine bone-structure, a good figure, a mane of blonde hair, and wore dark-rimmed glasses which ( pace Dorothy Parker) did nothing to diminish her looks. Her face, in composure, was striking. But, when she smiled, a row of magnificently crooked (and in later life, tobacco-tanned) teeth would give a suddenly vulnerable look to her face. Garbo became Grenfell.</p> <p>At Oxford she took a first. The temporary absence from the university of its men probably meant that the clever Miss Jones got closer attention from teachers than peacetime \"sweet girl graduates\" might expect. The lack of male competition certainly made it easier for her to get an assistant lectureship at the University College of Leicester, in 1946 (after graduation she was a schoolteacher for a year or two).</p> <p>On arrival in Leicester, Jones took up a small flat on the corner of Stoneygate's Springfield Road and Cross Street. There was a tiny farm nearby and the congenial Clarendon (a Bass pub), which she and her drinking friends favoured at Sunday lunchtime. This flat would be her home for 25 years.</p> <p>In the postwar period came the events and changes which would condition the rest of Jones's life. After an unpleasant internal feud, the Leicester English department was taken over in the mid-1950s by a new head, AR Humphreys. The most courteous and deeply learned of scholars, Humphreys got on well with Jones personally. But, in contrast to his predecessor (AS Collins), he embodied new standards of professionalism for an expansionist era of British higher education. Little new was to Jones's taste. And nothing new in universities.</p> <p>Her position in the department was the traditional one of Miss Bluestocking - with the difference that she was smarter, wittier, and (not infrequently) better read than many of her colleagues. She was, to complicate things, an object of male desire. Many undergraduates, well into the 1960s, fantasised - hopelessly - about an affair with her.</p> <p>The ambivalent reactions she provoked are evident in the two representations of her in fiction. Margaret Peel in Lucky Jim is a malicious portrait which, inexplicably, Larkin allowed his best friend Kingsley Amis to put into print, with the proviso that he change the character's name from the libellously close \"Margaret Beale\" (two of her first names). Malcolm Bradbury (a former student) offers a friendlier, but equally cross-grained, depiction of Jones in his Leicester roman \u00e0 clef , Eating People Is Wrong.</p> <p>Jones's position in the department, where she would work until 1981, was tricky. She surrounded herself with a small coterie of trusted friends in whom she could confide - often scathingly, always wittily. Her colleagues were uneasily aware that, behind their backs, they were, perhaps, being mocked. Meanwhile, her public demeanour was inscrutably demure. It was dangerous to patronise or condescend to her.</p> <p>In 1947 came Jones's first meeting with Larkin - who had just taken up a position in Leicester's library. They became lovers in 1950, just before he went off to a post at Belfast. He would eventually find his career berth at the library of the University of Hull. The intricate history of the relationship is told authoritatively (and sensitively) in Andrew Motion's 1993 life of Larkin.</p> <p>Monica was doggedly faithful to Philip - despite the opportunities available to a single woman of her gifts and attractions in the 1950s and 1960s. Philip was serially unfaithful to Monica: unable, apparently, to be creative as a poet without the tensions of infidelity and uncertain commitment in his emotional life. He would visit her - usually at weekends - en route to and from his aged mother, in Loughborough.</p> <p>They would take annual holidays together. A stream of gossipy letters and phone conversations kept them in touch. Late in life she learned to type because she feared that arthritis (which had afflicted her mother) would interfere with the impetuous fluency of her letter-writing.</p> <p>I encountered Monica Jones as a teacher in 1960. Her first lecture to the first year was on Wuthering Heights. She came in, dressed to the nines under her Oxford gown, slammed down a Timex alarm-clock on the lectern and tore into Emily Bront\u00eb for her incredible perversity in calling so many of her characters by the same names. Wholly inconsiderate. It was very funny (and meant to be).</p> <p>At other moments in the lecture, Jones fixed on moments of what she took to be vindicating beauty in the novel. I can hear her now reading out the final lines about the moor's \"unquiet sleepers\" and (in full-blooded Yorkshire accent) the \"blubbering\" little boy's account of \"Heathcliff and a woman, yonder under t' Nab\". The essence of Jones's teaching was the personal relationship (as she conceived it) with the writers she admired. Those she admired most tended to be clubbable males: Scott, Thackeray, Trollope, Crabbe. These authors were, she would tell students who shared her enthusiasm, \"gold in your pocket for life\". A favourite modern writer was the American, Peter de Vries. His acid jokiness, streaked with dark, non-conformist pessimism, was congenial with her own view of things.</p> <p>Jones despised the dour doctrines of Downing College, Cambridge, which were, during most of her career, dominant in the country's English departments (\"lead us, heavenly Leavis lead us\" was one of her favourite jibes). Her approach to her subject was marked by dislikes fully as passionate as her literary loves. She had a peculiar contempt for Yeats (\"imagine - a grown man wanting to be a clockwork bird on an emperor's tree!\"). She had as little time for Sylvia Plath (whose name she consciously mispronounced \"Plahth\") as did Larkin (privately) for Ted Hughes.</p> <p>Of Larkin's harem, Jones was the woman with most claim to be his intellectual equal. To her friends, at that time, it was evident that many of Larkin's famous perversities chimed with hers, and may well have originated with her. She, like him, felt that \"in this age, it is more distinguished not to publish\". She, like him, was defiantly insular (\"I'm sure I should not like to travel abroad - the dust !\"). Larkin may well have been inspired by her in his championing of John Betjeman as the great living poet (unlike him, Jones did not have much time for Auden). It is appropriate that Larkin's best-known volume, The Less Deceived, should be dedicated to her.</p> <p>As a mentor, Jones was inflexibly sensible. Women students who came to her with \"personal problems\" were quite likely to be told that scrubbing floors was a sovereign remedy (it worked for her). Men might be told to try the local pub. That evidently worked for her as well. She liked the company of the male undergraduates she trusted, drinking halves for their pints. At home, she favoured gin and tonic in goblet glasses the size of small goldfish bowls.</p> <p>Her company, even where she was the only woman, was never inhibiting. Her political attitudes were paradoxical. When the brilliant Dipak Nandy was appointed to the department, she gaily told one of her confidants, \"we've appointed a coloured communist\". None the less, she became a close friend of her new colleague (friendly to him and about him). When, in the late 1960s, immigration from East Africa was transforming Leicester's urban population, she would shock friends by saying that she was contemplating voting National Front. This seems to have been a gesture of solidarity with Larkin's grumpy (and unlovely) xenophobia. Or perhaps a symptom of her own increasing anger with things.</p> <p>On her favoured students, her influence was strong but, arguably, risky for those more ambitious than she was for the good things of academic life. She fostered a kind of marching out of step which guaranteed that - like her - one would not get on in career terms. To sign up with Monica Jones for the full duration was, in effect, to commit professional hara-kiri. Honourable, elegant, but suicidal.</p> <p>Yet, even if one did not sign up, one felt she was \"right\" in her conviction that good books were more important than dreary writing about books; and that the industrialisation of literary studies in the interest of academic careerism was wrong.</p> <p>\"Wanted, good Hardy critic\" was Larkin's famous call. Jones's view was that most of our great writers wanted good critics - and they were increasingly unlikely to be found in the ranks of the modern British university system.</p> <p>Shamefully, she was never promoted beyond the rank in which she entered the profession. To be merely a superb lecturer was insufficient grounds for the modest promotion to senior lecturer. This, to be fair, was not the fault of her departmental (and rapidly promoted) colleagues, but the administration at Leicester.</p> <p>Jones, after the death of her parents and in growing disillusion with the profession (never the subject), lived principally for her relationship with \"Philip\" and its highpoints: the remote Scottish holidays and the annual mid-June jaunt to the Lord's Test match. Since it clashed, invariably, with the wrap-up of final-examination meetings, the getaway to the members' stand added the enlivening excitement of truancy to the end of each teaching year. She was, it should be recorded, a conscientious examiner. It was a matter of pride that \"her\" questions were often lifted by other English departments.</p> <p>Jones retired early, on grounds of ill-health (and, doubtless, private disillusion) in 1981. She at last moved in with Larkin, who had rationalised his love-life sufficiently for her to be an acknowledged consort. She none the less kept the small house near Hexham which she had bought in 1961 (since she never learned to drive, it was increasingly difficult for her to get to). Larkin died, prematurely, in 1985, leaving the bulk of his estate to Jones.</p> <p>She lived on in his house, for 15 reclusive years. On Larkin's death, Jones took it on herself to interpret her partner's final wishes, and destroyed his 30 volumes of diaries and private papers. Larkin's will was, as Motion points out, ambiguous on this matter. She was not. Her own voluminous correspondence with Larkin (and his with her) is deposited, under time restriction, at the Bodleian Library.</p> <p>When the archive is opened and put into print, she will, to a certainty, be revealed as one of the great comic correspondents of her time. None of her contemporaries, alas, will be alive to read this posthumous publication. It is an irony that would have pleased her. It is, as she might have said, more distinguished to publish after death.</p> <p>\u0095 Margaret Monica Beale Jones, academic, born May 22 1922; died February 15 2001</p>",

She had fine bone-structure, a good figure, a mane of blonde hair, and wore dark-rimmed glasses which ( pace Dorothy Parker) did nothing to diminish her looks. Her face, in composure, was striking. But, when she smiled, a row of magnificently crooked (and in later life, tobacco-tanned) teeth would give a suddenly vulnerable look to her face. Garbo became Grenfell. At Oxford she took a first. The temporary absence from the university of its men probably meant that the clever Miss Jones got closer attention from teachers than peacetime \"sweet girl graduates\" might expect. The lack of male competition certainly made it easier for her to get an assistant lectureship at the University College of Leicester, in 1946 (after graduation she was a schoolteacher for a year or two). On arrival in Leicester, Jones took up a small flat on the corner of Stoneygate's Springfield Road and Cross Street. There was a tiny farm nearby and the congenial Clarendon (a Bass pub), which she and her drinking friends favoured at Sunday lunchtime. This flat would be her home for 25 years. In the postwar period came the events and changes which would condition the rest of Jones's life. After an unpleasant internal feud, the Leicester English department was taken over in the mid-1950s by a new head, AR Humphreys. The most courteous and deeply learned of scholars, Humphreys got on well with Jones personally. But, in contrast to his predecessor (AS Collins), he embodied new standards of professionalism for an expansionist era of British higher education. Little new was to Jones's taste. And nothing new in universities. Her position in the department was the traditional one of Miss Bluestocking - with the difference that she was smarter, wittier, and (not infrequently) better read than many of her colleagues. She was, to complicate things, an object of male desire. Many undergraduates, well into the 1960s, fantasised - hopelessly - about an affair with her. The ambivalent reactions she provoked are evident in the two representations of her in fiction. Margaret Peel in Lucky Jim is a malicious portrait which, inexplicably, Larkin allowed his best friend Kingsley Amis to put into print, with the proviso that he change the character's name from the libellously close \"Margaret Beale\" (two of her first names). Malcolm Bradbury (a former student) offers a friendlier, but equally cross-grained, depiction of Jones in his Leicester roman \u00e0 clef , Eating People Is Wrong. Jones's position in the department, where she would work until 1981, was tricky. She surrounded herself with a small coterie of trusted friends in whom she could confide - often scathingly, always wittily. Her colleagues were uneasily aware that, behind their backs, they were, perhaps, being mocked. Meanwhile, her public demeanour was inscrutably demure. It was dangerous to patronise or condescend to her. In 1947 came Jones's first meeting with Larkin - who had just taken up a position in Leicester's library. They became lovers in 1950, just before he went off to a post at Belfast. He would eventually find his career berth at the library of the University of Hull. The intricate history of the relationship is told authoritatively (and sensitively) in Andrew Motion's 1993 life of Larkin. Monica was doggedly faithful to Philip - despite the opportunities available to a single woman of her gifts and attractions in the 1950s and 1960s. Philip was serially unfaithful to Monica: unable, apparently, to be creative as a poet without the tensions of infidelity and uncertain commitment in his emotional life. He would visit her - usually at weekends - en route to and from his aged mother, in Loughborough. They would take annual holidays together. A stream of gossipy letters and phone conversations kept them in touch. Late in life she learned to type because she feared that arthritis (which had afflicted her mother) would interfere with the impetuous fluency of her letter-writing. I encountered Monica Jones as a teacher in 1960. Her first lecture to the first year was on Wuthering Heights. She came in, dressed to the nines under her Oxford gown, slammed down a Timex alarm-clock on the lectern and tore into Emily Bront\u00eb for her incredible perversity in calling so many of her characters by the same names. Wholly inconsiderate. It was very funny (and meant to be). At other moments in the lecture, Jones fixed on moments of what she took to be vindicating beauty in the novel. I can hear her now reading out the final lines about the moor's \"unquiet sleepers\" and (in full-blooded Yorkshire accent) the \"blubbering\" little boy's account of \"Heathcliff and a woman, yonder under t' Nab\". The essence of Jones's teaching was the personal relationship (as she conceived it) with the writers she admired. Those she admired most tended to be clubbable males: Scott, Thackeray, Trollope, Crabbe. These authors were, she would tell students who shared her enthusiasm, \"gold in your pocket for life\". A favourite modern writer was the American, Peter de Vries. His acid jokiness, streaked with dark, non-conformist pessimism, was congenial with her own view of things. Jones despised the dour doctrines of Downing College, Cambridge, which were, during most of her career, dominant in the country's English departments (\"lead us, heavenly Leavis lead us\" was one of her favourite jibes). Her approach to her subject was marked by dislikes fully as passionate as her literary loves. She had a peculiar contempt for Yeats (\"imagine - a grown man wanting to be a clockwork bird on an emperor's tree!\"). She had as little time for Sylvia Plath (whose name she consciously mispronounced \"Plahth\") as did Larkin (privately) for Ted Hughes. Of Larkin's harem, Jones was the woman with most claim to be his intellectual equal. To her friends, at that time, it was evident that many of Larkin's famous perversities chimed with hers, and may well have originated with her. She, like him, felt that \"in this age, it is more distinguished not to publish\". She, like him, was defiantly insular (\"I'm sure I should not like to travel abroad - the dust !\"). Larkin may well have been inspired by her in his championing of John Betjeman as the great living poet (unlike him, Jones did not have much time for Auden). It is appropriate that Larkin's best-known volume, The Less Deceived, should be dedicated to her. As a mentor, Jones was inflexibly sensible. Women students who came to her with \"personal problems\" were quite likely to be told that scrubbing floors was a sovereign remedy (it worked for her). Men might be told to try the local pub. That evidently worked for her as well. She liked the company of the male undergraduates she trusted, drinking halves for their pints. At home, she favoured gin and tonic in goblet glasses the size of small goldfish bowls. Her company, even where she was the only woman, was never inhibiting. Her political attitudes were paradoxical. When the brilliant Dipak Nandy was appointed to the department, she gaily told one of her confidants, \"we've appointed a coloured communist\". None the less, she became a close friend of her new colleague (friendly to him and about him). When, in the late 1960s, immigration from East Africa was transforming Leicester's urban population, she would shock friends by saying that she was contemplating voting National Front. This seems to have been a gesture of solidarity with Larkin's grumpy (and unlovely) xenophobia. Or perhaps a symptom of her own increasing anger with things. On her favoured students, her influence was strong but, arguably, risky for those more ambitious than she was for the good things of academic life. She fostered a kind of marching out of step which guaranteed that - like her - one would not get on in career terms. To sign up with Monica Jones for the full duration was, in effect, to commit professional hara-kiri. Honourable, elegant, but suicidal. Yet, even if one did not sign up, one felt she was \"right\" in her conviction that good books were more important than dreary writing about books; and that the industrialisation of literary studies in the interest of academic careerism was wrong. \"Wanted, good Hardy critic\" was Larkin's famous call. Jones's view was that most of our great writers wanted good critics - and they were increasingly unlikely to be found in the ranks of the modern British university system. Shamefully, she was never promoted beyond the rank in which she entered the profession. To be merely a superb lecturer was insufficient grounds for the modest promotion to senior lecturer. This, to be fair, was not the fault of her departmental (and rapidly promoted) colleagues, but the administration at Leicester. Jones, after the death of her parents and in growing disillusion with the profession (never the subject), lived principally for her relationship with \"Philip\" and its highpoints: the remote Scottish holidays and the annual mid-June jaunt to the Lord's Test match. Since it clashed, invariably, with the wrap-up of final-examination meetings, the getaway to the members' stand added the enlivening excitement of truancy to the end of each teaching year. She was, it should be recorded, a conscientious examiner. It was a matter of pride that \"her\" questions were often lifted by other English departments. Jones retired early, on grounds of ill-health (and, doubtless, private disillusion) in 1981. She at last moved in with Larkin, who had rationalised his love-life sufficiently for her to be an acknowledged consort. She none the less kept the small house near Hexham which she had bought in 1961 (since she never learned to drive, it was increasingly difficult for her to get to). Larkin died, prematurely, in 1985, leaving the bulk of his estate to Jones. She lived on in his house, for 15 reclusive years. On Larkin's death, Jones took it on herself to interpret her partner's final wishes, and destroyed his 30 volumes of diaries and private papers. Larkin's will was, as Motion points out, ambiguous on this matter. She was not. Her own voluminous correspondence with Larkin (and his with her) is deposited, under time restriction, at the Bodleian Library. When the archive is opened and put into print, she will, to a certainty, be revealed as one of the great comic correspondents of her time. None of her contemporaries, alas, will be alive to read this posthumous publication. It is an irony that would have pleased her. It is, as she might have said, more distinguished to publish after death. \u0095 Margaret Monica Beale Jones, academic, born May 22 1922; died February 15 2001",

The research report admits that it \"does not clarify the mechanisms through which such an effect might work\". Indeed.",

The division's 88 titles include Myst III: Exile, which is likely to be a best-seller, Pool of Radiance, Prince of Persia, Chessmaster, Dogz, and Catz. Ubi Soft has recently taken over Red Storm in the US and, last month, Blue Byte in Germany. Toy manufacturer Mattel bought TLC for $3.8bn in 1998. Last October it gave TLC to Gores Technology Group for an undisclosed share of future profits. </p> <p><strong> Hard luck </strong><br> Sony PlayStation 2 owners can now store their saved games on a PC hard drive instead of using a memory card.

What makes this possible is Datel's \u00a329.99 X-Port system, which includes a USB cable and software for Microsoft Windows 98/Me.

The system will sell for $99.95, with games priced at $29.95 to $39.95. More than 60 titles have been scheduled, including Super Mario Advance and F-Zero: Maximum Velocity (Nintendo), Rayman (Ubi Soft), Ready 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2 (Midway) and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (Activision). In Japan, Tsunekazu Ishihara, who is in charge of Pok\u00e9mon production, said a new series of Pok\u00e9mon games will be launched for the Game Boy Advance next year. These will use a new GBA peripheral, the E-Card Reader. Pok\u00e9mon E-Card trading cards will hold up to 2K of data on creatures using a barcode-style system called Scan Talk, developed by Olympus Optical. Myst taken Ubi Soft, the fast-growing French software house, has confirmed that it is taking over The Learning Company's games business. The division's 88 titles include Myst III: Exile, which is likely to be a best-seller, Pool of Radiance, Prince of Persia, Chessmaster, Dogz, and Catz. Ubi Soft has recently taken over Red Storm in the US and, last month, Blue Byte in Germany. Toy manufacturer Mattel bought TLC for $3.8bn in 1998. Last October it gave TLC to Gores Technology Group for an undisclosed share of future profits. Hard luck Sony PlayStation 2 owners can now store their saved games on a PC hard drive instead of using a memory card. Once saved, the game data can be e-mailed to friends or uploaded to the net. What makes this possible is Datel's \u00a329.99 X-Port system, which includes a USB cable and software for Microsoft Windows 98/Me. However, you have to save games using a standard memory card before you can transfer them to a PC. Datel is selling X-Port online at www.d3world.com.

      "body": "<p> With every question, the arms of the year six class at St Marks primary school in North London, are strained skyward, fingers wriggling. Maths never used to be like this. </p> <p>The school, off the Holloway Road, is among the first in Britain to ditch the blackboard and introduce the white board - an internet enabled piece of kit that looks like a giant computer screen and appears to have hit the spot as far as this group of 10-year-olds is concerned. </p> <p>On the schedule today is numeracy, more specifically the relationship between fractions, decimals and percentages. One exercise uses a line on the board marked from 0.1 at one end to 1.0 at the other. Beneath are a jumbled series of fractions or percentages which the children successively drag across the board to put in the right place under the line, using a marker \"pen\". </p> <p>Another exercise has the children \"dipping\" the marker in various coloured inks on the sidebar and joining together the fractions/ decimals/percentages that equal each other. On the classroom door, a homemade poster using pasted-on circles with segments cut out to illustrate fractions is curling up at the edges and looking distinctly forlorn. </p> <p>The white board has a familiar Windows appearance with a drop-down menu, and it can go straight online to access any websites, including prepared lessons from the manufacturer RM. It is also linked to a series of PCs in the classroom allowing the pupils to continue the exercises on their own. </p> <p>Clive Wisby, the school's deputy head and the class teacher, has had the technology installed for around nine months and has noticed a significant change. \"It has increased their motivation levels. The kids interact more and discuss things more,\" he says. \"It is particularly good for low attainers who need the graphic representations that they are now getting. The technology also gives the lesson more pace.\" </p> <p>Wisby's comments are borne out by research which has demonstrated the link between better performance in classrooms and investment in new technologies. The British Educational Communications Technology Agency (Becta) recently found that 54% of schools with good levels of technology rated above the national average in English and 58% in maths. </p> <p>But the white board used by St Marks is still only scratching the surface of the potential for change being wrought on education by web-based technologies. The potential use of the internet for learning also has profound implications outside the classroom. In the adult education market, distance learning has been transformed by the internet. </p> <p>The advantages of using the net in the classroom add up to far more than the ability to access text books online. Applications in web-based technology, particularly the provision of diagnostic tools for pupil and teacher to provide constant assessment, are over and above what could be achieved through traditional teaching methods. </p> <p>In the US and some parts of the UK, schools have already started using handheld wireless devices to answer questions, much like the audience in Who Wants to be a Millionaire?\", enabling a teacher to instantly analyse whether what they have been saying has sunk in. Each of the students inputs their answer to a question. This not only tells the teacher whether the material needs further explaining but also singles out students having difficulty with a subject. If used properly, the devices could mean fewer children get left behind. </p> <p>\"The average primary school teacher gets about two minutes one-to-one contact with each child every day and it can be very difficult to work out in that time who has got problems and why,\" says RM's chief product evangelist Russell Prue. But the gadgets (officially called ATOL keypads) are not cheap - a batch of 30 costs around \u00a35,000. </p> <p>The political will to improve educational standards on both sides of the Atlantic has led governments to commit significant amounts of cash to getting schools online. </p> <p>Last year, another \u00a31bn was earmarked for investment in new technology for schools as part of the National Grid for Learning in Britain. The government's stated aim is a computer for every five pupils, compared with one for every nine in 1998. In the US, the number has fallen from 16 students per computer in 1992 to four last year. </p> <p>The investment bank Merrill Lynch estimates the global e-learning market is currently worth $3.5bn but will grow to $25bn by 2003. In the US there are 15 stock market listed e-learning companies offering everything from corporate tuition for executives to interactive history lessons for kids. Only one - the University of Phoenix - is currently profitable. It delivers degrees over the web. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Colin Hughes, the publisher of the Guardian-backed education portal, Learn.co.uk, says education has a bright future online. \"Along with sex and sport, education is one area with a guaranteed future on the internet,\" he says. \"Education is fundamentally about access to resource and communicating and those are two of the net's biggest strengths. </p> <p>\"Combine that with the predictable growth of computing in schools and it makes online education one of the few areas that investors are prepared to put money into during this time of dot.com misery.\" </p> <p>The internet is also allowing students to customise their learning, developing at their own pace. In the US, it has proven particularly useful in multi-cultural classrooms where lessons can be delivered in different languages. </p> <p>Marjorie Scardino is chief executive of Pearson, which is developing a wide range of internet-based educational products. She says: \"Until now the teacher has stood there facing 30 kids and they have all been taught in the same way. With the internet, they can be reached on their own terms, in their own way and in their own time.\" </p> <p>Less attractive to some pupils will be the idea of extending the school day and being under the more watchful eye of parents. Products coming onto the market - one from Pearson's NCS4School - include software linking schools and homes, allowing parents to look at attendance records, test results, homework assignments and the curriculum. Tests can also be marked online. The next time a parent asks their child what they did at school that day and the reply \"nothing\" comes back, they will be able to check. </p> <p>Getting children to take part in interactive homework lessons may involve some solutions, Prue says. \"We can now deliver our products over Sega's Dreamcast system. Two-thirds of 14-year-olds have games machines at home but only a third have PCs.\" </p> <p>Spark Island is another interactive online education channel aimed at three to 12-year-olds, their parents and teachers. For a \u00a3200 annual fee, schools can access a range of age-related and curriculum-based learning resources across English, maths and science, as well as lesson plans, articles, news and links to other sites. Parents who pay \u00a349 a year can access a series of articles covering everything from curriculum concerns and how to choose a school, to relationship and health matters, as well as a buying guide for books, tapes, software, toys and games. </p> <p>Two million school pupils regularly use RM's portal Internet for Learning at school, while Living Library - an online research tool containing tailored information on every aspect of the UK curriculum from Roman settlements to earthquakes - is in 35% of primary schools. </p> <p>Other products in development include the Ebrary, an online library from Pearson, which owns the education business of Simon &amp; Schuster, alongside fellow publishers, Random House and McGraw-Hill. Users will search and view books for free, but to print or download costs 15 to 25 cents a page. </p> <p>The BBC already offers a series of web-based education services including BBC Schools Online. But the corporation is, controversially, planning a substantial increase in investment to \u00a3135m to cover every subject in the curriculum. The proposed scheme is being piloted in 50 primary schools but is classed as a new service and as such needs to gain approval from culture secretary Chris Smith. </p> <p>The BBC plans are for individual computers and the interactive whiteboard. Like other programmes already available, the digital curriculum would give teachers the facility to customise material for individual pupils and keep track of their progress. </p> <p>The corporation would make it available for use at home and in local centres in the community, as well as the classroom. The service would be delivered primarily through the internet, but it would also be adapted for interactive digital television. </p> <p>For the BBC, like many others in the same space, broadband is the goal, allowing the corporation to incoporporate video from its substantial library. Pearson has also begun trials of a broadband product using its extensive back library of video from its television arm. </p> <p>The ability of internet-based technologies to make a deep impact will however depend on three factors: funding, teachers and parents. </p> <p>St Marks bought its white board with backing from the North Islington Education Action Zone - one of 25 in the country which are joint funded by business and local education authorties. </p> <p>Most schools don't just rely on initiatives like the EAZs or the government's National Grid money in order to fund their Information and Communications Technologies resources. Most also set aside money from their standard school budgets to fund ICT purchases which, with the internet, are increasingly no longer one-offs. The advent of the 'net, including content subscriptions, means planning ahead for ongoing costs. </p> <p>Wisby reports that teachers at St Marks are generally enthusiastic about the equipment - not least because lessons can be prepared at home on the laptop. Industry estimates suggest 50-65% of teachers will be new in the next five years, either straight from university or the private sector, where they will be comfortable with internet use. </p> <p>The role of parents is more debatable. Whether the availability of tools to play a bigger role in their children's school life will encourage more participation or create a wider social as well as digital divide, will need to be monitored. </p> <p><strong> Pupil eyes up education market with teaching resource</strong><br> Tom Hadfield, at just 18, may appear a little young to be building a website that aims become \"the number one teaching resource for parents and teachers\" but few doubt his credentials. </p> <p>The A level student from Brighton in Sussex was the creative force behind Soccernet, a popular football website backed by Associated Newspapers and then sold to Disney for \u00a340m - all before he had received his GCSE results. </p> <p>Now, with the help of his former journalist father Greg, Tom is running Schoolsnet, a website that they hope will become an indispensable educational tool for teachers and pupils alike. Resources include a guide to every school in the UK, an online library with more than 20,000 titles, schools sport news and some interactive lessons and revision packages. Revenue comes from advertising, sponsorship and sales of items such as books and stationery. </p> <p>It's a potentially large market but one that several bigger players are eyeing. Experts say it is a huge undertaking to address all the necessary areas of education comprehensively. </p> <p>Many of Schoolsnet's potential rivals have more resources and stronger strategic partners. The BBC, with a long history of providing educational programming, is expected to become the market's most important player. Meanwhile, Channel 4, which has proved adept at building niche websites, has several sites including Homeworkhigh.co.uk and 4learning.com. Cash-rich Granada Media is also spending heavily on various projects, although rivals say that it lacks brand awareness in schools. </p> <p>Learn.co.uk, a Guardian Newspapers Limited backed venture, entered the market last May planning \"to cover every dot and comma of the National Curriculum\". It hopes to license content to bigger portals or sell subscription packages. </p> <p>The expectation that not everyone in the market will succeed has been underlined by the closure of Learnfree.co.uk, a site affiliated to News International's Times Educational Supplement. </p> <p>Greg Hadfield acknowledges that Schoolsnet has a battle on its hands. \"We're seeing a settling out of the players but I'm confident we will be one of the ones that survives,\" he says. </p> <p>Schoolsnet attracts around 212,000 visitors a month. Of these, 40% are teachers, 40% are parents, and the rest are pupils. </p> <p>\"More than half of our adult users have bought online and we are working on converting more visitors into buyers,\" he said. </p> <p>Schoolsnet, which last April raised cash from newspaper group Newsquest and an IT firm based on a valuation of \u00a340m, expects to break even in 12-18 months' time. However, it does not disclose current revenues or cash burn. Analysts believe that the company needs to bring in a strong strategic partner to ensure its long-term survival. (JC)</p> <p> <strong> PC evangelist sets sights on kit for kids</strong><br> Professor Henry Beker is a man on a mission. The founder of internet security specialist Baltimore Technologies wants to give every child in the UK access to a computer at school. </p> <p>It's a project that is likely to cost in the region of an eye-watering \u00a38bn. The e-Learning Foundation, the charity he founded in 1999 to improve technology access in school, is not picky about whether the device is a laptop, a desktop or a palmtop computer - it just wants them in pupils' hands. </p> <p>\"With skills shortages now rated by British industry leaders as their single most important concern - ahead of even competition and regulation - the time is right for this bold new initiative,\" says Beker. </p> <p>The initiative runs in parallel with the National Grid for Learning's programme of getting every school in the UK online by 2002 and improving the IT literacy of the next generation of workers. </p> <p>Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have endorsed Beker's efforts. David Blunkett's education and employment department has made \u00a3500,000 available to the project this year with the express aim of helping low-income families and children from disadvantaged areas. </p> <p>But most of the funding will have to come from the private sector.

But most of the funding will have to come from the private sector. Microsoft has led the way by committing \u00a31m over two years. Meanwhile, other companies large and small are being courted for donations. Parents will be asked to contribute \u00a35 per week to help cover the cost of laptops. Beker's background includes degrees in mathematics and electronic engineering and a PhD in mathematics. He founded Baltimore, which for a brief period last year was one of Britain's 100 most valuable stock market listed companies. (JC)",

Despite a rather uneventful day in the Big Brother house - there were no evictions - 6.4m viewers tuned in to watch the four remaining contestants sweat it out as they waited to hear who would be next for the chop. The figure gave Channel 4 a healthy 27% share of the viewing at 9pm and helped to boost ER's ratings to 3.6m. This was 700,000 more than the US drama achieved last week, according to unofficial overnight figures. The second instalment of Celebrity Big Brother, screened at 10.35pm on BBC1, pulled in a further 4.2m viewers. This took the total to 10.6m, the same as the combined figure for the previous day. Elsewhere, reality TV proved less of a draw. Channel 5's bizarre Touch the Truck gameshow pulled in just 900,000 viewers to give it a 4% share. But it was still a big boost for the Dale Winton-fronted show - earlier in the week it had struggled in the ratings with just 500,000 viewers. The second part of BBC1's heavily promoted John Cleese documentary the Human Face also performed disappointingly. The programme was down by more than 1m viewers on last week's debut. An audience of just 3.5m gave the Human Face a 15% share.",

In his fiercest assault to date on the Tories over race, Mr Kennedy claimed that his Conservative counterpart's warnings that Britain was becoming a \"foreign land\" were \"playing on some people's fears and pandering to some people's prejudices\". The accusation, made in a speech in London to party strategists, came on the day that leaders of Britain's five parliamentary parties signed a joint declaration promising not to exploit race issues or stir up prejudice at the general election. The declaration, drawn up by the commission for racial equality, commits the party leaders to disciplining anyone found to be playing the race card in future campaigns. During a wide-ranging speech Mr Kennedy used strong language to attack Mr Hague, although he also took pains to avoid accusing the Tory leader personally of racism. He said: \"I do not believe that William Hague is a racist. But by his use of emotive language over the issue of asylum and immigration, and now by his claim that Britain is becoming a 'foreign land', William is playing on some people's fears and pandering to some people's prejudices. \"William Hague is not racist - but by choosing his language so carelessly he shows himself to be soft on racism and soft on the causes of racism.\" The Conservative leader should \"stop using the easy language of fear and start behaving like a responsible leader of a political party\". The charge of pandering to racism was last night dismissed as \"ludicrous\" by the Tories. Mr Hague's spokesman said: \"Charles Kennedy was with William Hague and the prime minister this afternoon when they signed a document against racism and I don't think he said any of this to him then.\" The Liberal Democrat leader was \"wilfully misinterpreting\" the meaning of Mr Hague's reference to a foreign land, made during his party's spring conference in Harrogate 10 days ago, the aide suggested. \"It is quite clear that the context of William's remarks was the threat from the European superstate and the loss of the currency.\" Mr Hague infuriated one nation Tories as well as opposition critics when he warned that a second term of Labour government would create a \"foreign land\" in a speech which also contained promises to lock up all asylum seekers and immediately deport those losing their claims. Painting a picture of \"the royal mint melting down pound coins ... the chancellor returning from Brussels to raise taxes still further\", he added: \"That is not bigotry, it's plain common sense.\" Mr Kennedy, who will launch further attacks on Mr Hague for jumping on a bandwagon of prejudice at his own party's spring conference this weekend in Torquay, plans to make a defence of social justice and civil rights a key theme of election campaigning. While the Liberal Democrats will be critical of Tony Blair, particularly if Labour fails to include a promise of a referendum on proportional representation, their message will be \"Labour a disappointment, Tories a disaster\", according to one aide. By portraying Mr Hague as an extremist willing to pander to the most hardline members of his party, they hope to win over more moderate Tories to their own side. The CRE last night declined to comment on the latest race row, arguing that its new compact was intended to encourage the public to respond if it felt parties were playing to race prejudices. Elsewhere in his speech, Mr Kennedy insisted his party could win \"more votes and more seats\" in the forthcoming general election than it had in 1997. He attacked the government's record on public services, saying his party was prepared to tax more and spend more on health, education and crime to secure improvements.",

      "body": "<p>The victory of Yoweri Museveni in this week's Ugandan presidential election was hardly unexpected.</p> <p>Although facing a serious challenger for the first time since he took power in 1986, Museveni won 69% of the vote, only three points down on his 1996 total.</p> <p>But claims by Museveni's principal opponent, Kizza Besigye, that the election was rigged, were not unexpected either.</p> <p>\"I vehemently reject the election results\u0085 and demand fresh elections,\" Besigye, who gained 28% of the vote, told Uganda's election commission.</p> <p>He said he was the victim of \"massive fraud\". Independent observers said that while malpractice and voter intimidation had been recorded at about 10% of polling stations, it was unlikely that fraud had affected the overall outcome. \"This election reflects the will of Ugandans,\" said the head of the non-governmental organisation, Election Monitoring Group.</p> <p>There are two problems with this comfortable assertion. One concerns the conduct of the election campaign prior to Monday's vote. The other concerns the ability of Ugandans to express their \"will\" in future elections, especially in 2006 when Museveni is due to stand down.</p> <p>The independent Human Rights Watch group was in no doubt about the way this year's campaign was run. In a report issued earlier this month, its Africa division counsel, Binaifer Nowrojee, reported serious problems.</p> <p>\"The Museveni government is trying to win this election by bullying the opposition. The electoral playing field is definitely not level. Since the start of the campaign in January, the opposition have been threatened by violence, arrests and intimidation from soldiers and police,\" Nowrojee wrote.</p> <p>Amnesty International also expressed worries about respect for democratic freedoms in the run-up to the poll. Launching a human rights manifesto for Uganda at the end of January, backed by 12 Ugandan NGOs, Amnesty urged all Ugandans \"to understand that they have rights and to demand that all presidential candidates make a public commitment to improve their human rights\". Numerous incidents of intimidation and the production of fake ballot cards, were reported in the weeks preceding election day.</p> <p>\"In a number of cases, police dispersed rallies held by supporters of opposition candidates,\" Amnesty said, adding that in one incident in January, two of Besigye's supporters were killed by unidentified gunmen.</p> <p>The US state department's annual human rights report also painted an unflattering picture of Museveni's rule when it was published last month.</p> <p>It highlighted the government's \"severe restriction of political activities\", \"serious human rights abuses\" by the internal security organisation (which answers direct to Museveni), the directorate of military intelligence, and the police, and the frequent arrest of individuals without charge and their detention without trial.</p> <p>The opposition's contention, therefore, is that much of the electorate was thoroughly intimidated long before polling day arrived.</p> <p>Museveni is rightly given much credit in the west and elsewhere for pulling his country out of the chaos he inherited from Milton Obote and Idi Amin.</p> <p>His record in reducing poverty, combating Aids, extending primary education and encouraging private business led former US president Bill Clinton to praise him as a role model for African leadership.</p> <p>But for these reasons, and because of Museveni's careful nurturing of relations with foreign aid donors, the election campaign irregularities and abuses are unlikely to become a big issue outside Uganda.</p> <p>Compared with recent events in Congo and Zimbabwe, for example, Uganda's problems of political leadership do indeed look like small beer.</p> <p>But as Museveni embarks upon his final term as president, bigger questions will loom over Uganda's political future. In particular, Museveni's refusal to allow opposition groups to form independent political parties may increasingly become untenable.</p> <p>Under a unifying system devised by the president, all Ugandans currently belong, in theory, to the \"Movement\". Opponents may stand in elections as individuals but they are not allowed to develop separate power-bases.</p> <p>Dissatisfaction with this system is likely to grow as Ugandans begin to wonder who and what will follow Museveni, and seek to articulate differing visions of their country's future.</p> <p>Criticising current arrangements, Human Rights Watch's Nowrojee wrote: \"It is more clear than ever that Museveni's Movement system is in fact a means to perpetuate his power through a system that does not allow free and fair democratic elections.\"</p> <p>A failure over the next five years to establish an alternative to this system, which depends on and principally serves one man, could spell future disaster for Uganda.</p> <p>If he really wants to go down in history as the man who put Uganda back on his feet, Museveni should concentrate in his final term on building a democratic, pluralist democracy that can withstand the passing of a president.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:simon.tisdall@theguardian.com\">simon.tisdall@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28simon+tisdall%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=simon+tisdall&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Simon Tisdall</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.state.gov/\" target=\"_new&quot;\">US state department</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.hrw.org/\" target=\"_new\">Human Rights Watch</a> <br> <a href=\" http://www.amnesty.org/\" target=\"_new\">Amnesty International</a> <br> <a href=\" http://www.africanews.com/monitor/\" target=\"_NEW\">The Uganda Monitor</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.government.go.ug/ \">Ugandan government</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The victory of Yoweri Museveni in this week's Ugandan presidential election was hardly unexpected. Although facing a serious challenger for the first time since he took power in 1986, Museveni won 69% of the vote, only three points down on his 1996 total. But claims by Museveni's principal opponent, Kizza Besigye, that the election was rigged, were not unexpected either. \"I vehemently reject the election results\u0085 and demand fresh elections,\" Besigye, who gained 28% of the vote, told Uganda's election commission. He said he was the victim of \"massive fraud\". Independent observers said that while malpractice and voter intimidation had been recorded at about 10% of polling stations, it was unlikely that fraud had affected the overall outcome. \"This election reflects the will of Ugandans,\" said the head of the non-governmental organisation, Election Monitoring Group. There are two problems with this comfortable assertion. One concerns the conduct of the election campaign prior to Monday's vote. The other concerns the ability of Ugandans to express their \"will\" in future elections, especially in 2006 when Museveni is due to stand down. The independent Human Rights Watch group was in no doubt about the way this year's campaign was run. In a report issued earlier this month, its Africa division counsel, Binaifer Nowrojee, reported serious problems. \"The Museveni government is trying to win this election by bullying the opposition. The electoral playing field is definitely not level. Since the start of the campaign in January, the opposition have been threatened by violence, arrests and intimidation from soldiers and police,\" Nowrojee wrote. Amnesty International also expressed worries about respect for democratic freedoms in the run-up to the poll. Launching a human rights manifesto for Uganda at the end of January, backed by 12 Ugandan NGOs, Amnesty urged all Ugandans \"to understand that they have rights and to demand that all presidential candidates make a public commitment to improve their human rights\". Numerous incidents of intimidation and the production of fake ballot cards, were reported in the weeks preceding election day. \"In a number of cases, police dispersed rallies held by supporters of opposition candidates,\" Amnesty said, adding that in one incident in January, two of Besigye's supporters were killed by unidentified gunmen. The US state department's annual human rights report also painted an unflattering picture of Museveni's rule when it was published last month. It highlighted the government's \"severe restriction of political activities\", \"serious human rights abuses\" by the internal security organisation (which answers direct to Museveni), the directorate of military intelligence, and the police, and the frequent arrest of individuals without charge and their detention without trial. The opposition's contention, therefore, is that much of the electorate was thoroughly intimidated long before polling day arrived. Museveni is rightly given much credit in the west and elsewhere for pulling his country out of the chaos he inherited from Milton Obote and Idi Amin. His record in reducing poverty, combating Aids, extending primary education and encouraging private business led former US president Bill Clinton to praise him as a role model for African leadership. But for these reasons, and because of Museveni's careful nurturing of relations with foreign aid donors, the election campaign irregularities and abuses are unlikely to become a big issue outside Uganda. Compared with recent events in Congo and Zimbabwe, for example, Uganda's problems of political leadership do indeed look like small beer. But as Museveni embarks upon his final term as president, bigger questions will loom over Uganda's political future. In particular, Museveni's refusal to allow opposition groups to form independent political parties may increasingly become untenable. Under a unifying system devised by the president, all Ugandans currently belong, in theory, to the \"Movement\". Opponents may stand in elections as individuals but they are not allowed to develop separate power-bases. Dissatisfaction with this system is likely to grow as Ugandans begin to wonder who and what will follow Museveni, and seek to articulate differing visions of their country's future. Criticising current arrangements, Human Rights Watch's Nowrojee wrote: \"It is more clear than ever that Museveni's Movement system is in fact a means to perpetuate his power through a system that does not allow free and fair democratic elections.\" A failure over the next five years to establish an alternative to this system, which depends on and principally serves one man, could spell future disaster for Uganda. If he really wants to go down in history as the man who put Uganda back on his feet, Museveni should concentrate in his final term on building a democratic, pluralist democracy that can withstand the passing of a president.

      "bodyText": "The government hugely expanded the foot and mouth slaughter programme today to include hundreds of thousands more animals than expected as the toll of the disease continued to rise. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, told the Commons that he was implementing a policy of \"safety first\" with the backing of farming groups. The new measures entail slaughtering healthy animals where a strong risk of infection exists and, in the worst case scenario, could push the animal death sentence towards a million. The policy was welcomed as \"grim but necessary\" by the National Farmers' Union, which warned that the slaughter would leave large swathes of farmland effectively \"dead\". Mr Brown said: \"We are intensifying the slaughter of animals at risk in the areas of the country - thankfully still limited - where the disease has spread.\" However, he said the government also hoped over the next 7-10 days to relax restrictions in areas that still \"remained clean\". The new slaughter programme includes culling all animals within 3km exclusion zones in Cumbria, which is an area of high infection. It was not yet clear whether the cull would include wild animals, or whether the cull zones would apply to other high infection areas such as Devon and Dumfries and Galloway. Up to 100,000 sheep which may have come into contact with diseased animals through markets in Welshpool and Northampton but have not yet developed the disease will also be traced and killed. In Devon, where foot and mouth had been spreading from farm to farm, vets and trained lay staff will carry out \"intensive patrols\" within the 3km zones of infected farms. The NFU said the culls would mean the slaughter of a \"significant\" number of healthy animals. The NFU president, Ben Gill, said: \"There will be many tears around the British countryside today. Our farms should be starting to jump to life with newborn lambs and calves. \"Instead, many will feel that spring has been cancelled and their farms are simply dead.\" The chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, revealed yesterday that 132,000 animals had already been killed. The Prince of Wales yesterday announced a \u00a3500,000 aid package for farmers, to ease the plight of those under severe strain from the \"dreaded outbreak\" and spoke of his fears of the crisis causing suicides.

The key to persuading campaigners and councillors from as far afield as Liverpool and Lewisham to come on board was Birmingham city council's decision to ballot on a mayor.</p> <p>This is despite widespread resistance to the idea of mayors from local politicians. Research from the Local Government Association last year showed that just 1% of councils wanted a mayor, and that the vast majority favoured cabinet-style local government. But while this may be the less radical option, it could prove just as difficult to implement. </p> <p>The media has given the new structures associated with the modernisers a rough ride because of plans for cabinet councillors to take decisions in private. The regional press, opposition politicians and freedom of information campaigners have persuaded the government to make concessions on openness. Ministers now insist councils take key decisions in public, although concerns remain about how well the government has defined which decisions those should be. </p> <p>More worryingly, research on the new structures has not all been positive. A government report on six councils that were piloting the new arrangements expressed concern that the scrutiny of cabinet decisions was poorly developed. This scrutiny function is crucial to the government's new structures, and is designed to give backbench councillors a chance to hold their executive colleagues to account. The findings point to a long period of upheaval and confusion in local government before the new structures bed down.</p> <p>The lack of enthusiasm for modernisation among many councillors could prolong and complicate that process. More than a third of those who stood down at last year's local elections gave political modernisation as a reason. Conservatives in particular feel cabinets and mayors are an unwanted Whitehall imposition, and politicians of all parties fear their role will decline as day-to-day executive power is concentrated in the hands of a small number of local councillors.</p> <p>The changes will also affect local government officials, who will have to reassess their position in relation to these more powerful politicians. Senior officers who are used to having an important policy-making role could find themselves becoming simple administrators under a city mayor, and Birmingham's chief executive Sir Michael Lyons last year announced his resignation for just this reason.</p> <p>The concerns are understandable. Officers, councillors, ministers and campaigners are now exposed to the electorate in a way they never have been before. Local voters have the power to directly effect a revolution in their town and city halls, and to make or break political careers in the process. If they topple one domino, the chances are that more will follow.</p>",

Research from the Local Government Association last year showed that just 1% of councils wanted a mayor, and that the vast majority favoured cabinet-style local government. But while this may be the less radical option, it could prove just as difficult to implement. The media has given the new structures associated with the modernisers a rough ride because of plans for cabinet councillors to take decisions in private. The regional press, opposition politicians and freedom of information campaigners have persuaded the government to make concessions on openness. Ministers now insist councils take key decisions in public, although concerns remain about how well the government has defined which decisions those should be. More worryingly, research on the new structures has not all been positive. A government report on six councils that were piloting the new arrangements expressed concern that the scrutiny of cabinet decisions was poorly developed. This scrutiny function is crucial to the government's new structures, and is designed to give backbench councillors a chance to hold their executive colleagues to account. The findings point to a long period of upheaval and confusion in local government before the new structures bed down. The lack of enthusiasm for modernisation among many councillors could prolong and complicate that process. More than a third of those who stood down at last year's local elections gave political modernisation as a reason. Conservatives in particular feel cabinets and mayors are an unwanted Whitehall imposition, and politicians of all parties fear their role will decline as day-to-day executive power is concentrated in the hands of a small number of local councillors. The changes will also affect local government officials, who will have to reassess their position in relation to these more powerful politicians. Senior officers who are used to having an important policy-making role could find themselves becoming simple administrators under a city mayor, and Birmingham's chief executive Sir Michael Lyons last year announced his resignation for just this reason. The concerns are understandable. Officers, councillors, ministers and campaigners are now exposed to the electorate in a way they never have been before. Local voters have the power to directly effect a revolution in their town and city halls, and to make or break political careers in the process. If they topple one domino, the chances are that more will follow.",

      "body": "<p>On Saturday, it will be a fortnight since Emma Strangwayes-Booth last had a cigarette. \"I was really ill a few weeks ago,\" she says. \"I had a viral infection of my airways and couldn't breathe. It was really horrible and I'm sure I was iller because I'd been smoking for so long.\" </p> <p>Strangwayes-Booth, 26, has been smoking for 13 years and has often thought of giving up. \"I always found it really hard,\" she says, \"and all the things you can buy to help seem so expensive.\" But yesterday she decided to hang the expense and buy her first nicotine replacement patches. They cost her \u00a314.73 for seven. </p> <p>Strangwayes-Booth is exactly the kind of person the Department of Health hopes will give up smoking for good. Yesterday - No Smoking Day - the public health minister, Yvette Cooper, announced that nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) would soon be available via NHS prescriptions. </p> <p>The new policy, starting at the end of April, will cost the government between \u00a310m and \u00a340m a year - pennies compared with the \u00a31.7bn that the NHS spends on smokers annually. It means that GPs will be able to prescribe NRT products such as nicotine patches, gum and inhalers to smokers who want to quit. It will be up to individual GPs to decide who gets what, but those recipients will be benefiting financially. One \u00a36 prescription will be enough for two weeks' supply. At the same time, some NRT products will be made available at supermarkets. </p> <p>Strangwayes-Booth, a receptionist at Goldcrest Films in London, is impressed by the plan. \"I think it's a really good idea for the NHS to try to help people stop smoking, and I would definitely go to my doctor to get a prescription,\" she says. \"It's also sensible to be able to buy patches or gum at the same places you can buy cigarettes, rather than have to go to a chemist.\" </p> <p>The plans are part of New Labour's heavy emphasis on public health. Its 1998 white paper introduced a multitude of targets, from healthy eating to cutting heart disease, including three aimed at cutting down smoking. A fourth anti-smoking target, aimed particularly at the poorly paid, was added as part of the NHS cancer plan. Its target is a reduction in the number of smokers among manually skilled workers from 32% to 26% by 2010. </p> <p>\"NRT will be available on prescription, because research shows that it doubles the chance of people giving up smoking,\" says an NHS spokesman. \"But it's also because we particularly need to help people in lower-income groups. They tend to smoke more and may find the cost of NRT prohibitive.\" </p> <p>But this doubled success rate only applies if you are ready to stop. Taking NRT cannot make you more committed to giving up smoking or transform you into a non-smoker, although it can help end the psychological habit of reaching for a cigarette. </p> <p>Professor John Britton, a consultant in respiratory medicine at Nottingham city hospital, admits that many smokers simply cannot quit. Over the course of a year, he says, only around a fifth of those who try to give up manage to do so permanently. And that includes those who go by his favoured method - using nicotine replacement therapy and getting behavioural support. </p> <p>\"NRT is not enough on its own. When you're trying to stop smoking, you need to be taught ways of dealing with times when having a cigarette seems like a good idea.\" </p> <p>Mary Ostle would second that. A heavy smoker for 35 years, she was getting through 25 to 30 cigarettes a day before deciding to quit last November. But Ostle, a nurse from Middleton St George, near Darlington, says it was preparation that helped her. </p> <p>\"So much more needs to be done for smokers. I managed to give up through determination, by knowing that having a cup of coffee made me want a cigarette, so not drinking coffee any more. But more support is needed. There aren't nearly enough smoking cessation clinics.\" </p> <p>She tried a Nicorette Inhalator, but says she only used it around four or five times. \"I didn't find it a lot of help,\" she says. \"It was kind of a prop, something to carry around, and it was very expensive. I'm sure many people wonder why they should spend money on that when they can buy a packet of fags for less money and enjoy themselves.\" </p> <p>Because of this, she is convinced that the government's plans are exactly what are needed. \"I'm sure this will be a success,\" she says. \"But it's about time it happened.\" </p> <p>\"I've been calling for this for years,\" says Britton. \"NRT is an extremely efficient clinical treatment which saves lives and doesn't cost much money. It hasn't made sense to deny it to those who are addicted. Other addicts get help. Why shouldn't those addicted to nicotine?\" </p> <p>In addition, he says, nicotine replacement therapy is a safe way to try to give up. The treatments work by giving people the nicotine they are addicted to, but in a way that is safe and controlled. </p> <p>\"There's a misconception about the dangers of smoking,\" he says. \"People think that it's nicotine that causes cancer, but that's not true. Cigarettes are dangerous because of the other things in them. It's the tar and other products of the cigarette which cause the harm.\" In other words, people smoke for the addictive nicotine, but it is not the most damaging substance. </p> <p>\"A cigarette delivers nicotine into your blood and that goes into your brain directly,\" says Britton. \"It's all very quick. The nicotine replacements don't work like that. You take them in through your skin, your mouth or your nose and they have to go right round your body to get to your brain. It's diluted and that's safer.\" </p> <p>Strangwayes-Booth is keen to try out her new patch. \"I really want to give up smoking this time,\" she says. \"But I haven't been to the pub yet. The patch will be coming with me, when I do, and I really hope it works.\"</p>",

Taking NRT cannot make you more committed to giving up smoking or transform you into a non-smoker, although it can help end the psychological habit of reaching for a cigarette. Professor John Britton, a consultant in respiratory medicine at Nottingham city hospital, admits that many smokers simply cannot quit. Over the course of a year, he says, only around a fifth of those who try to give up manage to do so permanently. And that includes those who go by his favoured method - using nicotine replacement therapy and getting behavioural support. \"NRT is not enough on its own. When you're trying to stop smoking, you need to be taught ways of dealing with times when having a cigarette seems like a good idea.\" Mary Ostle would second that. A heavy smoker for 35 years, she was getting through 25 to 30 cigarettes a day before deciding to quit last November. But Ostle, a nurse from Middleton St George, near Darlington, says it was preparation that helped her. \"So much more needs to be done for smokers. I managed to give up through determination, by knowing that having a cup of coffee made me want a cigarette, so not drinking coffee any more. But more support is needed. There aren't nearly enough smoking cessation clinics.\" She tried a Nicorette Inhalator, but says she only used it around four or five times. \"I didn't find it a lot of help,\" she says. \"It was kind of a prop, something to carry around, and it was very expensive. I'm sure many people wonder why they should spend money on that when they can buy a packet of fags for less money and enjoy themselves.\" Because of this, she is convinced that the government's plans are exactly what are needed. \"I'm sure this will be a success,\" she says. \"But it's about time it happened.\" \"I've been calling for this for years,\" says Britton. \"NRT is an extremely efficient clinical treatment which saves lives and doesn't cost much money. It hasn't made sense to deny it to those who are addicted. Other addicts get help. Why shouldn't those addicted to nicotine?\" In addition, he says, nicotine replacement therapy is a safe way to try to give up. The treatments work by giving people the nicotine they are addicted to, but in a way that is safe and controlled. \"There's a misconception about the dangers of smoking,\" he says. \"People think that it's nicotine that causes cancer, but that's not true. Cigarettes are dangerous because of the other things in them. It's the tar and other products of the cigarette which cause the harm.\" In other words, people smoke for the addictive nicotine, but it is not the most damaging substance. \"A cigarette delivers nicotine into your blood and that goes into your brain directly,\" says Britton. \"It's all very quick. The nicotine replacements don't work like that. You take them in through your skin, your mouth or your nose and they have to go right round your body to get to your brain. It's diluted and that's safer.\" Strangwayes-Booth is keen to try out her new patch. \"I really want to give up smoking this time,\" she says. \"But I haven't been to the pub yet. The patch will be coming with me, when I do, and I really hope it works.\"",

But what if you had a disease that was painful or debilitating, but unlikely to kill you? How do you assess potential risks when the whole point of the treatment is that you are the guinea pig? </p> <p>Earlier this week it was announced that a trial of a new treatment for Parkinson's disease had, for some patients, gone horribly wrong. A group of volunteers in the US had foetal cells transplanted directly into their brains, in the hope that they would survive and produce dopamine, the \"chemical messenger\" missing in patients suffering from Parkinson's. </p> <p>But the researchers were horrified to discover that instead of being helped by the experiment, a small number of the patients got much worse. The cells appear to have gone into overdrive, producing too much dopamine and causing the patients to writhe and jerk their heads uncontrollably. Unlike many experimental procedures, scientists have no way of reversing this particular treatment. The experiment has been stopped completely, prompting despair in many sufferers who hoped it offered a possibility for a cure. </p> <p>It is a sobering moment for those involved in trials at the cutting edge of medical research.

There's overwhelming evidence that people in trials do better than those outside them, whether they're receiving the test treatment or the placebo, probably simply because they get better care.\" </p> <p>His faith is borne out by Mary Combe, 80, who has been involved in Progres, a trial for a new treatment for stroke victims, for the last 5 years. After suffering a mini-stroke in 1996, her GP encouraged her to join the trial to find out whether conventional blood pressure-reducing drugs decreased the danger of further problems in high-risk patients, even if their blood pressure was not problematically high. While not testing a new drug, the application of this treatment in this area was untested. Its results will be released in June. </p> <p>Combe's experience has been a positive one. \"I had no doubts about doing the trial,\" she says, \"and went to the hospital every few months. I enjoyed my outings and had superb care. I was called back just yesterday to see how I was getting on.\" </p> <p>And it was that routine visit that may prove so important for Combe. \"I'd had a lump in my breast for ages, which I'd ignored. But as I was going, I thought I'd mention it, and the doctor gave me a good going over. He'll help get me seen quickly now.\" </p> <p>Her doctor and trial co-ordinator, Richard Lindley of Edinburgh's Western General Hospital, says it is just this kind of discovery that can make being involved in trials so beneficial. \"You're seen regularly by people with more time than usual, you chat, and get the chance to pick things up and deal with them early.\" </p> <p>But clinical trials remain highly risky, and public concern is understandable. In May, the US government produced a report which revealed that a number of research institutes were not taking risk and ethical considerations fully into account, and research was suspended in some of the country's top centres including Duke University and the University of California, Los Angeles. </p> <p>An example of the kind of thing that can go wrong is illustrated by the recent suspension of gene therapy trials run by Dr Jeffrey Isner, a top researcher at Tufts University in Massachusetts. He received a warning letter from the US food and drug administration last year because he had enrolled a patient into a study to see whether a gene for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could help grow new blood vessels in patients with heart disease or other circulatory problems. </p> <p>The administration found that Dr Isner had included in his trial one patient with lung cancer and that the VEGF gene may have fed this man's tumour. With gene therapy trials likely to become big business, clearer standards to control them are urgently needed. </p> <p>Facts on the number of people involved in trials have been incredibly difficult to come by, says Chalmers, because there is no mandatory requirement to register experiments.

These include the current third interna tional stroke trial, also being co-ordinated in Edinburgh by Lindley. Aimed at ascertaining whether a \"clot busting\" drug, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), increases the number of people who survive without disability after a stroke, the risk is that such drugs can increase bleeding within the brain, and could cause death if used in people where this was a problem. </p> <p>As Lindley explains, people are carefully screened before they are admitted to the trial to ensure, as far as possible, that this risk is not relevant to them. Strict criteria of this sort have enabled the trial to go ahead with an unusual \"waiver of consent\" rule.

Every year thousands of people in the UK survive, severely disabled, after a stroke. The value of rt-PA is unproven, but some doctors are so convinced of its benefits that they use it despite a lack of trial-based evidence. Lindley says that trials are vital to stop the \"postcode lottery\" of stroke care. As he explains: \"We must do the proper trial, find out if the treatment really works, and then make the drug available, or not, on this basis. If you have a stroke in, say, Glasgow or Newcastle, you may be given these drugs because some doctors there are confident that they work.\" </p> <p>While the failure of the Parkinson's trial is devastating for those affected and their families, Chalmers says that he would have participated in the trial himself.

The previous day his boss, Alastair Campbell, was even more robust.

His lawyer, Geoffrey Bindman insists that Mr Vaz has been cleared of everything except for a minor point.</p> <p>But each and every case looks a little bit dodgy. It just depends on your view of the standard of proof required.</p> <p>A \u00a3250 gift to his office here, an \u00a38 a month payment to his office there, a company set up by his wife and mother and run from his home address. Not really the image you want if you are a minister of the crown, even if you say it is all squeaky clean and above board.</p> <p>It seems extraordinary the lengths to which Mr Blair and Mr Cook have gone to defend the man, and it can't be just because he is the first Asian minister appointed by New Labour.</p> <p>Mr Cook waxes lyrical about Mr Vaz's ability and his knowledge of everything, particularly his responsibility for passports and visas at the FO. Mr Blair seems to think the whole affair is being cooked up by the media.</p> <p>Over the last two days Godric Smith and Alastair Campbell have been quizzed about this. Mr Campbell was asked: \"Has Mr Blair actually read the standards and privilege's committee's report?\" ''He's looked at it,'' he said. Had Mr Campbell read it? ''I've looked at it pretty carefully.''</p> <p>Still the questions remained unanswered. Is Mr Blair simply protecting his minister until after the election? MPs ask. Or did he sack the wrong minister in the Hinduja passports affair, Peter Mandelson, not Mr Vaz?</p> <p>The answer is increasingly looking like yes to both questions, and Mr Vaz himself might soon see the need to go himself.</p> <p>So far he is carrying on as if nothing has happened. That could be fatal. It may not be a sleaze tale of the proportion of the Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith \"cash for questions\" variety, but it sure stinks and he shouldn't be in government at the moment.</p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/\" target=\"_new\">Mandelson resigns</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/labour\" target=\"_new\">Labour in power</a><br></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,452123,00.html\" target=\"_new\">15.3.2001: Disgraceful and contemptuous - the secret verdict on Keith Vaz</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,450997,00.html\" target=\"_new\">13.3.2001: Minister 'delighted' by Commons verdict </a><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,451069,00.html \" target=\"_new\">13.3.2001: Watchdog attacksVaz for blocking inquiry</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,450998,00.html\" target=\"_new\">13.3.2001: Vaz attacks 'purveyors of lies and malice'</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,450667,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Comment: Why Vaz should take his leave </a> <br></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200001/cmselect/cmstnprv/314/31402.htm\" target=\"_new\"> Standards and privileges committee report</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.official-documents.co.uk/document/hc287/hc287/287.htm\" target=\"_new\">The Hammond Review</a><br></p>",

His lawyer, Geoffrey Bindman insists that Mr Vaz has been cleared of everything except for a minor point. But each and every case looks a little bit dodgy. It just depends on your view of the standard of proof required. A \u00a3250 gift to his office here, an \u00a38 a month payment to his office there, a company set up by his wife and mother and run from his home address. Not really the image you want if you are a minister of the crown, even if you say it is all squeaky clean and above board. It seems extraordinary the lengths to which Mr Blair and Mr Cook have gone to defend the man, and it can't be just because he is the first Asian minister appointed by New Labour. Mr Cook waxes lyrical about Mr Vaz's ability and his knowledge of everything, particularly his responsibility for passports and visas at the FO. Mr Blair seems to think the whole affair is being cooked up by the media. Over the last two days Godric Smith and Alastair Campbell have been quizzed about this. Mr Campbell was asked: \"Has Mr Blair actually read the standards and privilege's committee's report?\" ''He's looked at it,'' he said. Had Mr Campbell read it? ''I've looked at it pretty carefully.'' Still the questions remained unanswered. Is Mr Blair simply protecting his minister until after the election? MPs ask. Or did he sack the wrong minister in the Hinduja passports affair, Peter Mandelson, not Mr Vaz? The answer is increasingly looking like yes to both questions, and Mr Vaz himself might soon see the need to go himself. So far he is carrying on as if nothing has happened. That could be fatal. It may not be a sleaze tale of the proportion of the Neil Hamilton and Tim Smith \"cash for questions\" variety, but it sure stinks and he shouldn't be in government at the moment.

The decision by Granada TV bosses not to renew their contract with Ms Diamond will come as a blow to the former breakfast TV presenter.

      "body": "<p>Back in the early 1970s, when Peter Blake was teaching at Waltham Forest College in east London, the grand old man of British pop art used to \"booze quite a lot\". He would never leave home before 9am - which meant he was often late for work. Arriving late at the start of one term, he found his new class had already been sent out to do some sketching. Among them was Ian Dury, who later became the lead singer of the Blockheads. </p> <p>\"I thought I'd pop into a pub - only to find that Dury and other students were already there. Instead of saying, 'Let's get working,' I suggested we all had a drink, and after that Ian did a very nice painting. I think he was a bit shocked by a teacher being all right, and from then on we were friends, right through.\" </p> <p>Dury died last March, and now he is remembered in a tribute album called Brand New Boots and Panties. Blake designed the album cover and the original artwork is being auctioned through the Guardian in aid of Comic Relief.</p> <p>\"I think,\" says Blake, \"that Ian would have liked this. It's a unique piece, and these are rather valuable photographs.\" It is late evening, and the artist is in his London studio, finishing off a gloriously cheerful portrait of his old friend. </p> <p>Around the edges of the portrait - based on a 1970s picture by the rock photographer Penny Smith - are bright borders in green, red, yellow and blue. \"Those are the sort of borders that Ian used in his paintings,\" says Blake. \"He liked bright colours. He probably borrowed the idea from me, so I'm borrowing it back from him.\" Outside those borders, neatly stuck down, are a number of signed Polaroids, which Blake feared he had lost earlier in the day. They would have been hard to replace. </p> <p>All the artists on the album contributed these snapshots, and they are something of a Who's Who of British pop. There's Paul McCartney, whom he still sees, since Blake created the iconic album cover, for Sgt Pepper. Then there's Robbie Williams, Sinead O'Connor, Billy Bragg, Madness, Shane MacGowan, and members of the Blockheads, who provide the backing on most of the tracks. In the central painting, Dury is wearing a T-shirt with a picture of Joe Strummer of the Clash. Strummer, in his Polaroid, is wearing a T-shirt with a picture of Elvis. \"A nice kind of link,\" says Blake. The whole is a remarkable piece of art, and deserves to raise a hefty sum. </p> <p>Blake rated Dury as a painter (\"He was good - very graphic\"), and taught him again when he took a job at the Royal College of Art, soon after Dury \"and a whole group of other Walthamstow ruffians\" were accepted there. Later, Blake helped find him a flat near where he was living in Chiswick, and he even got him work. \"I was doing a lot of graphics, but when my painting became successful, I passed a lot of jobs on to Ian from the Sunday Times or the Observer. They were very brightly coloured, second generation pop art. He was very talented.\" </p> <p>But Dury moved on to music, despite the disabilities caused by childhood polio. When Blake first met him he even had problems walking: \"He was always losing his balance and falling over.\" But he built up his strength to become a compelling stage performer, first with Kilburn and the Highroads, then with the Blockheads, and to create his unique mix of punk, funk and English music hall. He stopped painting, though Blake remembers - \"he kept taking photographs, and with the Kilburns, he painted his amps with orange and green diagonal bands similar to imagery I used - and which I have now used again on that portrait.\" </p> <p>The pop star and the painter still kept in touch - Blake even toured with Dury and the Blockheads. When Blake held an exhibition at the Tate in 1983, he decided to include a list of all the bad reviews he had received - and then match them with good reviews from his pop star friends such as McCartney, Pete Townshend and Dury. Dury also composed a theme song for the exhibition, \"so as you went in, you heard Ian singing Peter The Painter. Last year, Paul McCartney followed that tradition by providing Blake with a \"sound collage\" for an exhibition that recently ended at Tate Liverpool. </p> <p>Pop music has played a crucial role in Blake's career, and between Sgt Pepper and Brand New Boots and Panties, he has produced a series of album covers, for the likes of the Who, Paul Weller, and Band Aid. Now 67, he's still a pop fan, keen to talk about music and enthuse about those Polaroids on the Dury cover. His extraordinary studio is littered with pop records and memorabilia, along with his shrines to Elvis, and the toys, models and assorted objects that he uses in his collages. \"My own life has been like a musical,\" he muses. \"The finale was at the National Gallery, with the Now We are 64 exhibition, and these are now the encores, singing different songs.\" I suspect his old friend Ian Dury would have liked that idea. </p> <p>\u0095 To bid for the original artwork for Brand New Boots and Panties, email <a href=\"mailto:comic.relief@theguardian.com\">comic.relief@theguardian.com</a> or write to Comic Relief Auction, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London, EC1R, 3ER.

Department of Communications \u0095 A separate department of communications should be set up with its own secretary of state. The new department would take over responsibility for broadcasting and media from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport; telecoms and internet from the Department of Trade and Industry; electronic delivery of government services from the cabinet office; and video regulation from the Home Office. Cross-media ownership \u0095 Existing cross media ownership rules should be removed, leaving general competition law, sector specific regulatory powers and content regulation by licensing. BBC \u0095 The House of Commons should be allowed to consider the future regulation and governance of the BBC as part of the upcoming communications bill. \u0095 Ofcom should take over the culture secretary's current responsibility for approving new BBC services. Public service broadcasting \u0095 In future the government should focus on providing public service content from the most appropriate source, rather than protecting the privileges of certain broadcasters for their own sake.

Jeremy Dear, the NUJ's national newspaper organiser, warned the union was \"extremely determined to avoid damaging cuts, both in terms of the number of staff and the conditions of the remaining staff\". Letters are going out to 540 editorial staff today, informing them Express Newspapers wants to cut 145 editorial and support posts over the next three months. The company confirmed that 130 of these are editorial jobs. Mr Dear hinted that strike action was a possibility as details of the redundancy programme unfold. \"I'm sure that resolution will come up at some point over the next few months,\" he said. \"Whether that time is now or further down the line, it's too early to say.\" A spokesman for Express Newspapers said the redundancies would be subject to a three-month consultative period, with the first consultation expected to start by April 10. The spokesman said: \"The management of Express Newspapers wants radically to change the culture of the way newspapers work, and they believe it will be possible to maximise capabilities significantly.\" He refused to comment on speculation that job cuts would be largely from the Express and Sunday Express, or that areas such as showbusiness and sport would bear severe cuts. Journalists at the paper say Express owner Richard Desmond has already singled out foreign travel for sports journalists as excess to requirements. This would make several posts redundant. Asked to comment on speculation that the Express plans to scrap its newsdesk in favour of subbed agency-generated copy, the spokesman said: \"All newspapers use agency copy extensively and the Express will continue vigorously to use agency copy.\" The letters will ask journalists whether they want to be consulted on an individual basis or through the unions. Completed forms must be returned by March 20. Mr Dear said the company had not yet asked staff to volunteer for redundancy, although it claims it wants the redundancies to be achieved voluntarily. \"I'm sure, given what's gone on there over the past few months, that there are people who will be tempted by redundancy,\" he said. \"But we are asking people to think about the remaining staff who will be left there after the redundancies - if they go ahead - are completed.\" Senior journalists who have worked with the paper in the past are astounded by Mr Desmond's action. One said: \"We all know that the good journalists disappear - they take the redundancy money in the knowledge that they can get employment elsewhere.

Fellow contestant Davina McFarlane, 22, a psychology student from east London, had been the only other person still left standing of the 20 original candidates. Other competitors had dropped out after suffering hallucinations from lack of sleep. One exhausted entrant let go of the vehicle after he imagined he had seen a pile of chocolate next to him. Kosovan refugee Ymer Abdullahu, 20, also started talking to others in his native tongue. David Guest, 50, imagined the vehicle had turned into an ocean liner. The programme, shown daily on Channel 5, was hosted by Dale Winton. It was also broadcast 24 hours a day on www.channel5.co.uk. The previous British record stood at 74 hours and 45 minutes. Contestants were allowed 10-minute toilet breaks every two hours and 15-minute food breaks every six hours. Mr Middleton said today: \"I feel okay. I think I'll probably feel loads better soon. I don't want the car. I plan to sell it and run in the general election. We've got sensible policies.\" Of the exhausted runner-up Davina McFarlane, he added: \"I've been in that dip where she was. She could have maybe come out of it and come right back. \"It was not until they said 'Take your hands off', and even then I didn't want to, until I knew for certain that I'd won it. Touch The Truck started with 20 contestants. Related stories Mar 13: Touch the Truck crashes in ratings Feb 21: Winton takes the wheel at C5 reality show",

And he said the government's proposal to allow the BBC to remain outside the control of independent regulators was \"utterly anomalous\". Gerald Kaufman was speaking as he released the select committee's report on the communications white paper. \"It seems utterly anomalous that there should be one broadcasting organisation only in the country that does not come under the remit of Ofcom,\" he said. \"What is being relied upon is that the BBC has its own public accountablity through the board of governors. \"But with respect to the excellent individuals who sit on the board, whether in this day and age of ever-advancing technology, they are the best people for the job, must be open to doubt,\" he said. The committee made no recommendations, but Mr Kaufman said his personal preference was a publicly appointed board of directors headed by an executive director. The report urged the government to include the \"unfinished business\" of how the BBC is governed in the upcoming communications bill. \"We find it absurd to suggest that parliament's role in reviewing the BBC's status will somehow be diminished if the BBC was subject to equal treatment with other broadcasters. The committee was responding to widespread calls from the media industry for the reversal of the communications white paper's proposal to leave the BBC governors outside the control of Ofcom. The report also recommended that Chris Smith's responsiblities for approving new BBC services should be handed over to Ofcom. It also urged the government to establish a new department of communications with its own secretary of state which would bring together the relevant responsibilities of the DCMS, Home Office, DTI and cabinet office. It also recommended that the government and TV industry launch an educational campaign on digital TV by October 2001.

      "body": "<p>Does it matter when we have an election? The spirit of the age says no. We're living at a time of matchless apathy. Cynical about all politicians, we surely couldn't care less about the timing of their little games. Why would people trouble themselves with the finer points of a mechanistic question, requiring engagement with a class of person whose performance in the game makes no difference to them anyway? Isn't the choice Tony Blair soon has to make a very minor matter?</p> <p>Call me a romantic, but I have to resist this, even though, when I did so a fortnight ago and proposed a postponement from May 3, I was dumped on by important people for credulous naivety. The hideous influx of foot and mouth disease has exposed a divide which is not between north and south, or rich and poor, or old and young, or numerate and illiterate, or friends of Blair and friends of Brown, or even between the city and the country. The divide is between two Britains, and two moods, and it becomes clearer day by day.</p> <p>The first mood infiltrates the entire administration, the entire Labour party, and almost the entire band of Labour's hangers-on. It is stern and purposeful. The election is a piece of machinery, an essential cog in the apparatus of government, calibrated and primed for active duty on May 3 2001 ever since the date, four years ago, when democracy last did the business for Mr Blair.</p> <p>This mood is much influenced by the diligence with which the given date has been prepared for. It is lost in wonder at the fineness of the budget, grovels before the timing of pension rises and other handouts, all of them made possible by the strategic foresight that led to an economic miracle reaching the apogee of its perceived brilliance at precisely the moment required. The hoardings are bought, the broadcasts planned, the party war-rooms readied for action down to the last on-line work-station allocated and mapped exclusively in the Guardian.</p> <p>The mood regards itself as doing a job of work. All this diligence is for the good of the country. For the country needs another Labour government to continue the start that's been made, and if stealing a year off the five-year mandate is the way to maximise the outcome, the duty of the prime minister is clear. Plainly he must do it quickly. His recent visits to marginal constituencies north, south, east and west cannot be allowed to go to waste. How cretinous to imagine otherwise! For this is the plan, and the plan must be kept to, in the national interest.</p> <p>Moreover, the public are apparently insisting that it should be. Asked if they want to vote now, more than 60% register the opinion that they wouldn't say no. An election by public demand! Besides, only 5% of voters live in areas affected by foot and mouth. Does anyone suggest the other 95% should be denied their rights to suit the convenience of this suffering, but ultimately insignificant, minority? Why should the majority be disappointed? The very fact that the election has been timetabled for the last four years becomes a reason for abruptly concluding it, come what may.</p> <p>Such is the mood of the professionals. It's not untouched by a secret cynicism. The parties duly out-cynic each other. Labour privately reckons the 5% in question are mostly in Tory areas any way. For their part the Tories pretend that the last thing they want is any delaying of the moment when they have the Blair cabinet gagging on the ground, the electorate's boot across its windpipe. But the key to the mood is its stony-eyed indifference to the broader view, its denial that any kind of crisis might exceed in importance the crisis of seeing the computerised coordinates of an electoral plan disturbed.</p> <p>There is a second Britain, and an alternative mood. In normal times it might accept some of the arguments of the professionals. The four-year term, after all, has become commonplace. Voters are used to the self- interested calculations of prime ministers. Each day now, though, the gulf gets wider between the thinking of the government and the feeling, the temper, the unarticulated sensibility of a public which, I believe, stretches well beyond the quietly disposable 5%.</p> <p>It's a question of propriety and priorities. Even voters a hundred miles from the nearest bovine funeral pyre become aware that something is wrong. To insist on conducting an unnecessary election while the fires are raging and unburied cadavers stink, far from asserting the timeless importance of democracy, will show the frivolity with which the present incumbents regard it. A country alerted by television to the sombre mood this calamity deserves to summon up will find itself forced into a procedure which, just now, does not seem overwhelmingly important.</p> <p>It's airily said that electoral procedure has changed. Nobody needs to move around any more, either to canvass or to vote. The mobile phone and the postal ballot are the disinfectants of virtual democracy. All true, for those who can arrange it. But all an apologia that comes from the professional's playbook, not from the experience that an election is supposed to be.</p> <p>My guess is that the first mood is going to win this contest. Its exponents are extraordinarily unyielding. They're the more focused, the more organised, and one man's imperial thumb, up or down, is enough to give the signal. Unless the next 10 days produce an upsurge of foot and mouth that even he cannot claim is under control, the four-year critical path will reach its predestined end.</p> <p>But two consequences can already be predicted with certainty. First, it will be a sour election. It was never likely to repeat the exultancy of 1997. It will now descend further into joylessness. In their guts, voters far beyond the county farmlands will feel it ought not to be happening. For all their preparations, the government will find the campaign hard to conduct. Unless foot and mouth is declared to be old news, or television is bludgeoned into adopting a new agenda, the paralysis of the countryside is likely to be displayed nightly alongside the affectations of imminent triumph over every problem, which is the message election campaigns are exclusively designed to convey. The contradiction will be jarring.</p> <p>It seems unlikely, second, to do Labour any favours. An election called as the culmination of an exercise in well-managed opportunism will have the opposite effect. Labour won't lose, whatever the date. But Labour will seem ruthless, and an agent of the very cynicism Mr Blair once looked as though he seriously intended to dispel. A foot and mouth election will lose votes, not win them, for the people who inflict it on us in their larger plan to take over the 21st century. Or else we will forgive them even this, and plod, untroubled, on our downward path to the incinerator of democratic virtue.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\"> hugoyoung@compuserve.com <br> <b>What's going on?</b><br></a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

      "bodyText": "Does it matter when we have an election? The spirit of the age says no. We're living at a time of matchless apathy. Cynical about all politicians, we surely couldn't care less about the timing of their little games. Why would people trouble themselves with the finer points of a mechanistic question, requiring engagement with a class of person whose performance in the game makes no difference to them anyway? Isn't the choice Tony Blair soon has to make a very minor matter? Call me a romantic, but I have to resist this, even though, when I did so a fortnight ago and proposed a postponement from May 3, I was dumped on by important people for credulous naivety. The hideous influx of foot and mouth disease has exposed a divide which is not between north and south, or rich and poor, or old and young, or numerate and illiterate, or friends of Blair and friends of Brown, or even between the city and the country. The divide is between two Britains, and two moods, and it becomes clearer day by day. The first mood infiltrates the entire administration, the entire Labour party, and almost the entire band of Labour's hangers-on. It is stern and purposeful. The election is a piece of machinery, an essential cog in the apparatus of government, calibrated and primed for active duty on May 3 2001 ever since the date, four years ago, when democracy last did the business for Mr Blair. This mood is much influenced by the diligence with which the given date has been prepared for. It is lost in wonder at the fineness of the budget, grovels before the timing of pension rises and other handouts, all of them made possible by the strategic foresight that led to an economic miracle reaching the apogee of its perceived brilliance at precisely the moment required. The hoardings are bought, the broadcasts planned, the party war-rooms readied for action down to the last on-line work-station allocated and mapped exclusively in the Guardian. The mood regards itself as doing a job of work. All this diligence is for the good of the country. For the country needs another Labour government to continue the start that's been made, and if stealing a year off the five-year mandate is the way to maximise the outcome, the duty of the prime minister is clear. Plainly he must do it quickly. His recent visits to marginal constituencies north, south, east and west cannot be allowed to go to waste. How cretinous to imagine otherwise! For this is the plan, and the plan must be kept to, in the national interest. Moreover, the public are apparently insisting that it should be. Asked if they want to vote now, more than 60% register the opinion that they wouldn't say no. An election by public demand! Besides, only 5% of voters live in areas affected by foot and mouth.

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Jack Straw, has been strongly criticised by the chief inspector of prisons for failing over two years to prevent conditions getting worse inside Winson Green, Birmingham - by common consent the worst jail in Britain. Sir David Ramsbotham said in a report published today that the appalling conditions which he revealed in a 1998 report have got worse. He made clear his frustration that Home Office ministers, including Mr Straw, reacted to his earlier findings by demanding \u00a3860,000 of budget cuts in Birmingham instead of sending in a taskforce and extra funds as they had done with other failing prisons. \"Having already appealed to ministers without success, what is the chief inspector of prisons meant to do or say, and to whom, when he and his team return to a prison, only to find that, despite some peripheral improvements, conditions for and treatment of prisoners are if anything worse than before?\" he said. The report is the most scathing the chief inspector has published in his five years in the job. He leaves the post this summer without his contract being renewed.

      "bodyText": "The advertising watchdog has brought out a highly critical report on the failure of the political parties to agree a new code of conduct for election advertising. The Advertising Standards Authority, which polices poster and print advertising, washed its hands of political advertising after the 1997 election. It decided that, as an unelected body, it was not qualified to judge the veracity of the parties' claims. The decision to opt out of regulating political advertising followed the furore over the Conservative party's \"demon eyes\" campaign, which portrayed Tony Blair as the devil. The ASA ruled against the advert, created by M&amp;C Saatchi, after it received 130 complaints from Labour party members and church groups. It was able to censure the ad under its privacy regulations because it portrayed Mr Blair as \"sinister and dishonest\" and because his permission had not been sought for the ad. At the same time, it rejected complaints the ad was offensive because it attributed satanic qualities to Mr Blair. But under the previous system, political parties were exempt from the guidelines regarding substantiation, truthfulness, testimonials, comparisons and denigration, making it impossible for the ASA to regulate them properly. So as of January last year, the ASA's codes have not applied to political campaigns. The watchdog and the Neill committee on standards in public life have called on the political parties to devise their own code and create a mechanism for considering complaints. But they have so far failed to do so and it is now extremely unlikely a new system will be in place before the upcoming election. \"It is unfortunate the political parties have not yet agreed a code for election advertising or agreed how such a code might be enforced,\" said the ASA in its report. \"The voters will decide for themselves what is 'decent, honest and truthful' while any election advertising that breaches the law will be a matter for the courts to judge.\" Related stories Mar 1: Political posters fail to make an impact Feb 27: Lib Dems unveil poster campaign Feb 15: Tory posters blast bureaucracy Useful link ASA website",

The children died on ward 24 at the Wexham Park hospital in Slough, Berkshire, between July 2000 and March this year, Thames Valley police said. The chief executive of the Heatherwood and Wexham Park hospitals trust, Margaret Edwards, said the deaths could just be a \"coincidence\". She added: \"Taken in isolation, each of these deaths don't give us any reason for concern. \"Concern has been raised because we experienced more deaths than we expected. \"It may just be a statistical cluster, a coincidence. But we have taken it seriously and asked the police to investigate.\" The death of the fourth child in March alerted consultant paediatricians at the hospital, who reported their concerns to Mrs Edwards on Monday night. Following police investigations, the female hospital worker was arrested last night but has now been released on bail pending further questioning. Detective superintendent Steve Morrison of Thames Valley police confirmed his officers would be working with constabularies such as Essex police who have dealt with similar allegations. The trust said no exceptional features emerged in the routine review of the deaths and postmortem examinations proved inconclusive. A family liaison officer has been drafted in to keep the bereaved families up to date with the progress of the investigation and a NHS Direct helpline has been set up for concerned relatives on 0845 4647.

But the most interesting question has yet to be asked: what was the British planning minister doing on a trade delegation to Egypt? The answer suggests that Mr Raynsford's alibi is rather more heinous than the alleged crime. </p> <p>Mr Raynsford was leading a delegation of 27 corporations. Among them were some of the most controversial multinationals stationed in this country: Balfour Beatty, Enron, Laing, Mott MacDonald, Thames Water and WS Atkins. The projects they visited included Egypt's most contested development scheme: the $90bn Toshka programme to divert the Nile. Environmentalists warn that it will devastate the river's ecology, financial consultants warn that it will have a similar impact on the country's economy. It's the sort of scheme, in other words, which, were it to have been proposed in Britain, should have been subject to the fiercest scrutiny by planning officials at the Department of the Environment (DoE), overseen by Mr Raynsford. </p> <p>Interestingly, the major beneficiary of the trade mission appears to have been not a British company, but a Norwegian one. Soon after the tour, Kvaerner revealed that it had landed a \u00a3266m contract to build a pumping system at Toshka. Kvaerner's otherwise inexplicable presence on a British trade tour might have had something to do with the fact that it had seconded more of its employees into the DoE than any other company. </p> <p>So why was Mr Raynsford, rather than a minister from the Department of Trade and Industry, helping these companies to sell their wares in Egypt? Well, Nick Raynsford has a curious double role. He is minister for planning, which means he is the regulator of development in Britain. But he is also minister for construction, which means he is the promoter of development in Britain. He routinely resolves this conflict of interests in favour of the industry he's supposed be regulating. </p> <p>Mr Raynsford has gone to some lengths to show construction companies whose side he is on. \"I see my job,\" he told Building magazine, as \"creating a climate in which the industry can do well.\" To this end, his division has sought repeatedly to undermine government policy. It has sponsored, for example, a public relations offensive for the quarrying industry called Minerals 98. One of its purposes was to help companies lobby against the tax on roadstone that another division of the environment department had proposed. </p> <p>At Labour's 1998 local government conference, Mr Raynsford argued against the environment department's plans for a tax on out-of-town parking places and in support of the superstores' objections to them. He has promised the British Council of Shopping Centres that he will seek to speed up major new retail schemes. Last week, he undermined the government's commitments on climate change by watering down the rules on energy efficiency in new homes, arguing that the standards were \"an undue burden on builders\". </p> <p>But perhaps most alarming is his alleged role in the debate about the Ilisu dam in Turkey: the devastating ethnic cleansing project that will drive 78,000 Kurds out of their cultural heartland. It was Mr Raynsford, according to Whitehall sources, who persuaded Tony Blair to back the project. Why should he have done so? Well, in September 1999 he led a trade mission to Turkey. The consortium he accompanied was seeking to land \u00a34bn-worth of contracts for rebuilding after the earthquake. The consortium was fronted by Balfour Beatty, which also happens to be the firm hoping to build the Ilisu dam. Three months later, the British government announced that it was \"minded to grant\" export credit for the Ilisu scheme. Is it possible that Mr Raynsford was told by the Turkish government that British rebuilding contracts were conditional on support for the dam? </p> <p>The real scandal surrounding the Oxford business school is that everything Mr Raynsford says about it is probably true. There were no peculiar measures taken to approve the development; there was nothing unusual about the government's decision not to review the case. Decisions to turn a blind eye to the destruction of our heritage and environment are taken on behalf of the construction industry every week, by the man who is supposed to be policing it.</p>",

Coincidentally, or not, on the eve of the conference, a British TV channel screened the 1995 Hollywood thriller Outbreak, starring Dustin Hoffman as a maverick military virologist given hours to find a vaccine to halt the spread of a deadly African virus in California before the military obliterates the town where it has taken hold. </p> <p>The film's opening is set in Africa and based on the emergence of the Ebola virus, which was first recorded in northern Zaire in 1976, where it infected 318 people, 280 of whom died. Outbreak then goes astray: rather than portraying years of clinical trials and exhaustive lab work, the movie locates the key to getting the vaccine for the fictional virus in the ability of Hoffman and Cuba Gooding Jr to dodge heat-seeking missiles in a tree-top helicopter chase.</p> <p>It's a silly film, except in one sense. There is a long, old and dramatic human struggle against viruses. Hollywood may have smothered it in melodrama, but the enemy is real enough to draw virologists to the movie - Dorothy Crawford refers to it in her introduction - and to contribute to the brittle atmosphere of the Royal Society conference. It was like a meeting of leaders in wartime, pleased to be there, but anxious at spending time away from work while lives were being lost on the front line.</p> <p>The military analogy isn't out of place. The flu pandemic of 1918-19 killed 100m people, more than died in the war which had just ended. In the late 20th and very early 21st centuries, when full-on warfare has become rarer and remoter for westerners, disease is now the area where we experience the feelings of emotional intensity associated with war, the crushing communal defeat, sudden personal loss, plodding hardship and hysterical relief at victory. Man has smallpox on the run; polio emerges. Polio is almost beaten; HIV begins its offensive. A vaccine against HIV may be within reach; what next? (The current foot and mouth epidemic is a reminder that viruses which afflict people are not the only enemy.)</p> <p>The story goes back to our ancient hominid ancestors, sitting in the darkness around a fire, afraid of the predators out there in the night. A million years later, we have killed or corralled all the big beasts which could hurt us, but the predators are still out there. We have shrunk the jungles, and think we have mastered all wild things, but those shrunken forests conceal the carriers of viruses which could wreak terrible destruction. There is a theory that some viruses are not just harmless to their hosts, but may even be beneficial to them because they cause deadly disease in their enemies - such as man. We still do not know the animal or insect which carries the Ebola virus, and one of the reasons could be that the virus has killed the few who have disturbed the animal's habitat. The closer man gets to the last wild strongholds, the closer he may be getting to the ultimate predator. Imagine a virus with the effect and latency period of HIV that could be spread by a sneeze.</p> <p>Viruses are hard to describe. They aren't exactly alive: their structure is non-cellular, and they can't survive for long without a host; they reproduce and evolve, but they don't breathe, eat or excrete (as bacteria do, after a fashion). One way to think about them is by a reverse analogy: a computer virus is nothing but a piece of code, a series of letters and numbers. To exist, the code doesn't even have to be on a disk: you could write it down in a notebook; you could memorise it. As long as it isn't inside a computer's operating system, it's harmless, dormant, abstract. Once the code is in a computer, however, it does three things. It acquires a host, it begins to make the computer run wrongly, and it can reproduce itself to spread to another computer. </p> <p>Biological viruses are similar. Outside living cells, they're not much more than a piece of information, a scrap of nucleic acid in an envelope of protein. But even if the HIV virus were one day wiped from the face of the earth, it would still be possible to write down the chemical sequence required to recreate it in a string of letters about as long as this article.</p> <p>The goal of a virus is to break into a cell, use the cell's facilities to reproduce itself, and then spread to the next host. If the cell (and the host) is damaged or dies as a result, too bad. I say 'goal', because it is hard not to see viruses as ingenious workers towards an end, so cunning are their methods. Colds and flu make you sneeze in order to spread themselves. The rabies virus travels in the saliva of an infected animal, which is why it's transmitted by biting. Once inside the new victim, the virus particles enter local nerve endings. With the host apparently unharmed apart from the bite, the virus slowly works its way up the nerves to the brain. It can take days; sometimes it takes years. But eventually the virus reaches the cells of the brain itself, where it causes encephalitis, driving the infected animal or person mad, often violently so. </p> <p>When the rage is at its height, the virus returns to the highway of the nervous system, heading for the salivary glands, where it reproduces. Just when the rabid animal's brain, inflamed by the virus, is most likely to drive it to turn its fangs on any creature within range, the virus has made sure its saliva is brimming with copies of itself.</p> <p>Herpes simplex virus usually enters the body through delicate, more easily broken tissue, or where there is a natural opening - by kissing, which leads to cold sores, or through sex, which leads to genital herpes. It gets inside skin cells, starts to reproduce and attracts the attention of the immune system, which snuffs it out and prevents future infection. But the original virus hasn't gone away. It has found another hiding place, inside nerve cells, where it can't reproduce but where the immune system can't detect it. The virus is there for ever, and a still poorly understood trigger mechanism will arouse it from its dormant state to produce cold sores and genital blisters again, capable of infecting others.</p> <p>HIV, the most closely studied virus ever, is grimly fascinating in its slow, precise work of destruction. The cells it attacks are the very cells which must survive if the virus is to be fought - CD4 T-cells, the marshals of the immune system. It's a retrovirus, which means it works backwards to smuggle its way inside the nuclei of human cells. Its genetic material is RNA, the chemical that normally 'reads' DNA; but retroviruses carry an enzyme that can copy the RNA's information into DNA molecules which then infiltrate human DNA. An HIV-infected person's blood may seem to have only a trace of the virus because it's working away in the lymph glands, where most CD4 cells are found. There, 100bn new virus particles are made each day, destroying one to two bn of the body's CD4 cells, a third of the total, in the process. The bone marrow makes new cells to replace those lost. This battle goes on for an average of 10 years before the bone marrow can no longer make good the body's losses, the immune system begins to collapse, and Aids sets in.</p> <p>There is good news from the evolutionary front, though. It's not necessarily to the virus's advantage to kill, or even disable, its host. Viruses which swiftly kill every host they enter are doomed because there is little chance of them being able to jump to another host. Ebola virus is a case in point. It is a fearsome disease which spreads through blood and sexual contact. For between two and 21 days, there are no symptoms. Then the infected person comes down with muscle pains, headaches and a fever. A phenomenon known as 'crash and bleed' sets in. Over a few days, the virus destroys the cells lining the blood vessels, and the patient suffers massive internal bleeding, accompanied by vomiting and diarrhoea: 50 to 90 per cent of those infected die. </p> <p>In the 1976 outbreak in Zaire, 85 women attending an antenatal clinic were given injections from the same Ebola-contaminated needle. All of them caught the virus, and all of them died. But the savagery of the illness makes it easy to spot Ebola at an early stage and to put in place containment measures. Even in this age of intercontinental air travel, the worst we can expect from Ebola is a succession of brushfire outbreaks, locally devastating but quickly identified and controlled.</p> <p>Herpes is less deadly, but more successful. It has been around for hundreds of millions of years and is endemic in a vast range of species. Even oysters have herpes. It spreads fairly easily, dodges precautions by erupting at long, unpredictable intervals in infected humans and is impossible to dislodge from its hiding place in nerve cells. Most important, it causes discomfort and embarrassment rather than disability and death. It will be around as long as the host is.</p> <p>HIV is an evolutionary champion. Because its information is carried as RNA rather than DNA, it has no mechanism to correct mistakes when it makes copies of itself, and the rate of mutation is fantastically high. Rapid mutation is one of the ways it escapes attack by the immune system. But this mutation rate may work to our advantage. From an evolutionary point of view, the more we practise safe sex, the more natural selection favours those HIV viruses which let the host live longer. Unprotected sex fails to punish viruses which slay their host early. HIV is young; hence its savagery. It would be much more widespread if it were less cruel to its hosts.</p> <p>Humankind does have a failsafe mechanism. Although we evolve slowly, there are so many of us that there are bound to be some who, by chance, carry a natural immunity to any virus. Not many, mind: in the case of HIV, it's about 1 per cent in people of Northern European descent, possibly as the result of natural selection during an ancient smallpox epidemic; but it's enough to puncture the vain notion, as self-regarding as the belief that mankind is indestructible, that a disease by itself could end our reign on earth.</p> <p>Mankind's relationship with viruses in the past few hundred years has followed parallel tracks: exterminate and propagate. Caroline, Princess of Wales in the early 18th century, had a robust attitude towards medical ethics. Introduced to smallpox inoculation by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who had seen it used in Turkey (scrapings from the pocks of the infected were dabbed onto a lightly bleeding cut), she was keen to use it on her own daughters. But she wanted to test it on someone else first, so she tried it on six condemned prisoners at Newgate jail. When they survived, just to make sure, she tried it out on 12 orphans. That was good, too. So, in 1723, the young princesses were inoculated, 75 years before Edward Jenner discovered that vaccination with cowpox would do to the job just as well, and the smallpox virus, which once killed 400,000 people a year in Western Europe alone, was on its way to extinction.</p> <p>In 1763, the British military commander in North America, Sir Jeffrey Amherst, became the first practitioner of viral warfare when he authorised the distribution of blankets contaminated with smallpox to American Indians who were making life difficult for European settlers in Pennsylvania. And this is how it has been: on the one hand, steady progress in understanding and defeating viruses; on the other, human actions that have led to the emergence, spread or survival of viruses - if more by accident than Amherstian design.</p> <p>The roll of honour in the war against yellow fever, which decimated the population of Philadelphia in four months in 1793, begins with Jesse Lazear, head of the clinical laboratories at Johns Hopkins Medical School. He was one of three American doctors who volunteered as guinea pigs on an expedition to Cuba in 1900 to test the theory, widely ridiculed, that mosquitoes spread the disease. He caught yellow fever and died; the link was soon proved and the importance of draining mosquito marshes realised. In 1937, a vaccine was developed. A success story. Yet increasing international trade and travel still threaten to give yellow fever a new lease of life, by spreading it across the Indian Ocean to Asia, where, Crawford warns, 'the virus would find a wholly unprotected population to infect.'</p> <p>The struggle against polio, which has triumphed to the point where it will soon, like smallpox, be declared extinct, is another remarkable story. Yet the disease, which spreads when traces of infected faeces are ingested, acquired an epidemic nature in the 20th century only in developed countries when strict hygiene had become the norm. Previously, polio had been endemic, and most children had caught mild, symptomless forms of the disease before they were five, gaining immunity. It could be argued that a victory had been gained over an epidemic humankind unwittingly brought on itself.</p> <p>Polio carries with it another lesson. It was still not clear by the end of the Royal Society conference whether there is a link between the African polio vaccinations and the success of the different strains of HIV in jumping species from monkeys and chimpanzees into humans and then spreading. What is known is that huge numbers of people - 98 million in the US alone - were given polio vaccine infected with another simian virus, known as SV40. The vaccine was grown in rhesus monkey cells at a time when the risk of animal viruses spreading to humans was poorly understood. So far there is little evidence that SV40 has done any harm, but it was a lucky escape. </p> <p>Our shifting of wildlife to the margins, our host of domesticated animals, our fondness for pets, our provision of new evolutionary niches for pests and our use of animals in medicine - all these offer new ways for viruses to move between species, whether by way of a deadly seal plague involving a virus caught from pet dogs, as happened in Northern Europe in the 1980s; or a new, severe flu pandemic from viruses found in Europe's overcrowded pig population; or the devastating consequence of viruses which have long been harmlessly carried by swine being transferred to humans as a result of future pig to human organ transplants.</p> <p>The dangers seem as great as ever. But our recently acquired knowledge of how viruses and cells work on a molecular level, particularly the breaking of the genetic code of different organisms, has greatly advanced the field of virology. New vaccines are being made which consist of nothing more than part of the chemical signature of a virus. The role of viruses in provoking cancer and auto-immune diseases - could a virus be responsible for multiple sclerosis?- is being explored. And modified versions of viruses, with their ability to break into cells and plant DNA there, are being used in gene therapy, to get properly working genes into the cells of people who don't have them.</p> <p>There are two ways of looking at this burgeoning medical revolution. One is as a set of many different potential medical breakthroughs, all offering hope for a cure of this or that disease. The other is as the beginnings of a complete understanding of how life on earth (in this context, everything from viruses to people) works as a single biochemical machine.

But one day we may find ourselves invited to cross that gap, from a world of incomplete, fuzzy solutions to disease, where solving one problem may lead to another, to a world whose entire ecosystem, including mankind itself, is continually being genetically redesigned. Already we're seeing the mass failure of antibiotics, with bacteria out-evolving our means to control them. It seems likely that viruses have more unpleasant surprises in store, and yet here we are, addicted to being cured.

      "bodyText": "The Invisible Enemy: A Natural History of Viruses by Dorothy Crawford (Oxford, 275pp, \u00a314.99, 11 September 2000, 0 19 850332 6) Buy it at a discount from BOL Last September, the Royal Society organised a conference to discuss Edward Hooper's book The River, which promoted the theory that HIV was accidentally spread to humans from chimpanzees through a polio vaccination programme in Africa in the 1950s. Coincidentally, or not, on the eve of the conference, a British TV channel screened the 1995 Hollywood thriller Outbreak, starring Dustin Hoffman as a maverick military virologist given hours to find a vaccine to halt the spread of a deadly African virus in California before the military obliterates the town where it has taken hold. The film's opening is set in Africa and based on the emergence of the Ebola virus, which was first recorded in northern Zaire in 1976, where it infected 318 people, 280 of whom died. Outbreak then goes astray: rather than portraying years of clinical trials and exhaustive lab work, the movie locates the key to getting the vaccine for the fictional virus in the ability of Hoffman and Cuba Gooding Jr to dodge heat-seeking missiles in a tree-top helicopter chase. It's a silly film, except in one sense. There is a long, old and dramatic human struggle against viruses. Hollywood may have smothered it in melodrama, but the enemy is real enough to draw virologists to the movie - Dorothy Crawford refers to it in her introduction - and to contribute to the brittle atmosphere of the Royal Society conference. It was like a meeting of leaders in wartime, pleased to be there, but anxious at spending time away from work while lives were being lost on the front line. The military analogy isn't out of place. The flu pandemic of 1918-19 killed 100m people, more than died in the war which had just ended. In the late 20th and very early 21st centuries, when full-on warfare has become rarer and remoter for westerners, disease is now the area where we experience the feelings of emotional intensity associated with war, the crushing communal defeat, sudden personal loss, plodding hardship and hysterical relief at victory. Man has smallpox on the run; polio emerges. Polio is almost beaten; HIV begins its offensive. A vaccine against HIV may be within reach; what next? (The current foot and mouth epidemic is a reminder that viruses which afflict people are not the only enemy.) The story goes back to our ancient hominid ancestors, sitting in the darkness around a fire, afraid of the predators out there in the night. A million years later, we have killed or corralled all the big beasts which could hurt us, but the predators are still out there. We have shrunk the jungles, and think we have mastered all wild things, but those shrunken forests conceal the carriers of viruses which could wreak terrible destruction. There is a theory that some viruses are not just harmless to their hosts, but may even be beneficial to them because they cause deadly disease in their enemies - such as man. We still do not know the animal or insect which carries the Ebola virus, and one of the reasons could be that the virus has killed the few who have disturbed the animal's habitat. The closer man gets to the last wild strongholds, the closer he may be getting to the ultimate predator. Imagine a virus with the effect and latency period of HIV that could be spread by a sneeze. Viruses are hard to describe. They aren't exactly alive: their structure is non-cellular, and they can't survive for long without a host; they reproduce and evolve, but they don't breathe, eat or excrete (as bacteria do, after a fashion). One way to think about them is by a reverse analogy: a computer virus is nothing but a piece of code, a series of letters and numbers. To exist, the code doesn't even have to be on a disk: you could write it down in a notebook; you could memorise it. As long as it isn't inside a computer's operating system, it's harmless, dormant, abstract. Once the code is in a computer, however, it does three things. It acquires a host, it begins to make the computer run wrongly, and it can reproduce itself to spread to another computer. Biological viruses are similar. Outside living cells, they're not much more than a piece of information, a scrap of nucleic acid in an envelope of protein. But even if the HIV virus were one day wiped from the face of the earth, it would still be possible to write down the chemical sequence required to recreate it in a string of letters about as long as this article. The goal of a virus is to break into a cell, use the cell's facilities to reproduce itself, and then spread to the next host. If the cell (and the host) is damaged or dies as a result, too bad. I say 'goal', because it is hard not to see viruses as ingenious workers towards an end, so cunning are their methods. Colds and flu make you sneeze in order to spread themselves. The rabies virus travels in the saliva of an infected animal, which is why it's transmitted by biting. Once inside the new victim, the virus particles enter local nerve endings. With the host apparently unharmed apart from the bite, the virus slowly works its way up the nerves to the brain. It can take days; sometimes it takes years. But eventually the virus reaches the cells of the brain itself, where it causes encephalitis, driving the infected animal or person mad, often violently so. When the rage is at its height, the virus returns to the highway of the nervous system, heading for the salivary glands, where it reproduces. Just when the rabid animal's brain, inflamed by the virus, is most likely to drive it to turn its fangs on any creature within range, the virus has made sure its saliva is brimming with copies of itself. Herpes simplex virus usually enters the body through delicate, more easily broken tissue, or where there is a natural opening - by kissing, which leads to cold sores, or through sex, which leads to genital herpes. It gets inside skin cells, starts to reproduce and attracts the attention of the immune system, which snuffs it out and prevents future infection. But the original virus hasn't gone away. It has found another hiding place, inside nerve cells, where it can't reproduce but where the immune system can't detect it. The virus is there for ever, and a still poorly understood trigger mechanism will arouse it from its dormant state to produce cold sores and genital blisters again, capable of infecting others. HIV, the most closely studied virus ever, is grimly fascinating in its slow, precise work of destruction. The cells it attacks are the very cells which must survive if the virus is to be fought - CD4 T-cells, the marshals of the immune system. It's a retrovirus, which means it works backwards to smuggle its way inside the nuclei of human cells. Its genetic material is RNA, the chemical that normally 'reads' DNA; but retroviruses carry an enzyme that can copy the RNA's information into DNA molecules which then infiltrate human DNA. An HIV-infected person's blood may seem to have only a trace of the virus because it's working away in the lymph glands, where most CD4 cells are found. There, 100bn new virus particles are made each day, destroying one to two bn of the body's CD4 cells, a third of the total, in the process. The bone marrow makes new cells to replace those lost. This battle goes on for an average of 10 years before the bone marrow can no longer make good the body's losses, the immune system begins to collapse, and Aids sets in. There is good news from the evolutionary front, though. It's not necessarily to the virus's advantage to kill, or even disable, its host. Viruses which swiftly kill every host they enter are doomed because there is little chance of them being able to jump to another host. Ebola virus is a case in point. It is a fearsome disease which spreads through blood and sexual contact. For between two and 21 days, there are no symptoms. Then the infected person comes down with muscle pains, headaches and a fever. A phenomenon known as 'crash and bleed' sets in. Over a few days, the virus destroys the cells lining the blood vessels, and the patient suffers massive internal bleeding, accompanied by vomiting and diarrhoea: 50 to 90 per cent of those infected die. In the 1976 outbreak in Zaire, 85 women attending an antenatal clinic were given injections from the same Ebola-contaminated needle. All of them caught the virus, and all of them died. But the savagery of the illness makes it easy to spot Ebola at an early stage and to put in place containment measures. Even in this age of intercontinental air travel, the worst we can expect from Ebola is a succession of brushfire outbreaks, locally devastating but quickly identified and controlled. Herpes is less deadly, but more successful. It has been around for hundreds of millions of years and is endemic in a vast range of species. Even oysters have herpes. It spreads fairly easily, dodges precautions by erupting at long, unpredictable intervals in infected humans and is impossible to dislodge from its hiding place in nerve cells. Most important, it causes discomfort and embarrassment rather than disability and death. It will be around as long as the host is. HIV is an evolutionary champion. Because its information is carried as RNA rather than DNA, it has no mechanism to correct mistakes when it makes copies of itself, and the rate of mutation is fantastically high. Rapid mutation is one of the ways it escapes attack by the immune system. But this mutation rate may work to our advantage. From an evolutionary point of view, the more we practise safe sex, the more natural selection favours those HIV viruses which let the host live longer. Unprotected sex fails to punish viruses which slay their host early. HIV is young; hence its savagery. It would be much more widespread if it were less cruel to its hosts.

Concern at animal rights protesters demonstrating outside the homes of those who run laboratories did not lead to a clear-eyed assessment of whether or not the police have sufficient powers to deal with intimidation or violence (in fact, they have ample powers to do so).

But in fact there's no evidence that taking away our rights has any effect whatsoever on levels of crime. Michael Howard told the Tory party conference in 1993 about his 26 changes to the criminal justice system which would make the difference to crime.

These proposals undermine the presumption of innocence, create a system in which accusations by the police will be enough to force people to disclose all their private financial affairs first to the authorities and then in public at the trial. Even if they are not found guilty, they will have been humiliated, had to pay for lawyers and have their private life dragged through the newspapers. There will be no jury and the judge will base decisions on the \"balance of probabilities\" - a person will be \"convicted\" on the basis they are \"probably\" guilty. </p> <p>The danger is that if no action is taken now to stop this it will be too late to recover the rights that have been cut away, slice by slice. </p> <p>John Wadham is director of Liberty.</p>",

But in fact there's no evidence that taking away our rights has any effect whatsoever on levels of crime. Michael Howard told the Tory party conference in 1993 about his 26 changes to the criminal justice system which would make the difference to crime. The resulting Criminal Justice &amp; Public Order Act 1994 locked up children, restricted bail, gave police extra powers to stop and search, restricted the rights of travellers, the homeless and protesters and eroded the right to silence -to no obvious benefit. Last week Labour announced new proposals to use the civil courts to confiscate the assets of those the police suspect of being criminals. These proposals undermine the presumption of innocence, create a system in which accusations by the police will be enough to force people to disclose all their private financial affairs first to the authorities and then in public at the trial. Even if they are not found guilty, they will have been humiliated, had to pay for lawyers and have their private life dragged through the newspapers. There will be no jury and the judge will base decisions on the \"balance of probabilities\" - a person will be \"convicted\" on the basis they are \"probably\" guilty. The danger is that if no action is taken now to stop this it will be too late to recover the rights that have been cut away, slice by slice. John Wadham is director of Liberty.",

      "body": "<p>As the time drew near for the American release of the movie Enemy at the Gates, about a duel between two snipers during the battle of Stalingrad, director Jean-Jacques Annaud told the studio he didn't want it to go out with the tag \"based on a true story\". \"I wanted it to say 'based on a legendary duel', as we're saying for the publicity in France,\" he recalls. \"Paramount said: 'You may laugh, but for our publicity we have to tell them Stalingrad was a real battle.'\" </p> <p>You could understand Annaud, best known for The Name of the Rose and Seven Years in Tibet, feeling aggrieved. He has brought to western cinema screens a rare dramatisation of one of the second world war's greatest battles, which saw armies hurled against each other by stubborn dictators, a city destroyed, and Nazi Germany exposed at last to the nature of its folly. Although the film has no US, British or French characters, Annaud managed to wring enough money from backers - $90 million, according to one report - to make Enemy at the Gates the most expensive non-US movie ever. </p> <p>But if the director and his co-writer, Alain Godard, expected praise from historians for countering the US-skewed Hollywood version of world history with a Hollywood-style treatment of the Soviet role in beating Hitler, he was expecting too much. The best-known modern western chronicler of the battle of Stalingrad, Antony Beevor, has denounced the film as yet another piece of tawdry multiplex fodder, enticing punters with the come-on line of historical accuracy but adulterating it with lies. In an article in the Sunday Telegraph, Beevor conceded that he thought the combat sequences and sets better than Saving Private Ryan but went on: \"The film's visual verisimilitude does not overcome that basic clash of interest between historical truth and cinematic priorities.\" </p> <p>The story that Annaud believes is true and Beevor believes is false involves a young Soviet sniper in besieged Stalingrad, Vasily Zaitsev, played by Jude Law. Zaitsev's brilliance at picking off the enemy is seized on by a Soviet political officer (Joseph Fiennes), who turns him into a national emblem of defiance in the face of German might. While Zaitsev and his mentor compete for the affections of a beautiful woman soldier, Tania (Rachel Weisz), the unsettled Wehrmacht send for an ace sniper of their own, Major Konig (Ed Harris), to silence the Russian, and the two men duel to the death. </p> <p>Annaud's critics accuse him of naively - or cynically - accepting a classic piece of Soviet propaganda as true. While Zaitsev did exist, they say, he was not the best sniper, just the best-looking for picture purposes. More to the point, there is no evidence of a Major Konig in any German or Russian archives. The duel never happened: the Soviet propaganda machine invented it. </p> <p>Annaud, who says Beevor is a good friend, insists that he respects history. He and Godard based their script on an American book of the Cold War era and selected Russian sources. Annaud said he would not necessarily have stopped shooting the film if he'd read Beevor's book, but it is clear he is less certain now about the absolute truth of the Zaitsev-Konig duel. \"My intimate conviction is that there was a side of that story that happened, though part of it may have been invented by the commissars,\" he says. </p> <p>Beevor brackets Enemy at the Gates with two recent egregious examples of Hollywood lying - U-571, where US forces, rather than the Brits of reality, seize a Nazi code machine from a U-boat, and The Patriot, where the enslaved blacks of revolutionary America are portrayed, absurdly, as willing brothers in arms of non-racist white comrades. </p> <p>The comparison is unfair. There are no US heroes showing the Red Army how to snipe in Enemy at the Gates. We don't see friendly Nazi soldiers handing out tea and buns to captured Soviets. In historical terms, the degree of assumed inaccuracy in Enemy at the Gates is altogether more trivial - about on a par with the kind of criticism levelled at Hollywood when it makes \"real\" gangsters more beautiful and lovable than they really are. </p> <p>Annaud can't be accused of unquestioningly accepting Soviet propaganda when he portrays the slaughter of Red soldiers by their own side when they try to retreat. Even the Zaitsev story itself is full of ambiguity: the character resents his role as a propaganda creation, and Annaud never makes clear how many men he really killed. </p> <p>Which leaves the Konig story.

Yet under a virtually unknown trade agreement it won a case challenging the European Union's support for small Caribbean banana producers. The dispute was initiated under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats), after pressure from banana-growing multinationals and a large donation from Chiquita to the Democratic party in the US.</p> <p>Bananas need to be distributed, and distribution is a service under Gats. Such is the scope of what has been termed the most important trade agreement since 1948.</p> <p>Negotiations begin this month on the extension of Gats. If powerful industry lobbies have their way, Gats would undermine the ability of governments to act in the interests of the poor, workers, consumers and vulnerable groups in society. These powers are being replaced by new rights for multinational companies.</p> <p>Government rules on the provision of services are at the heart of the way societies treat their citizens. In 1994 Gats was signed as part of the agreements that set up the World Trade Organisation (WTO). It includes basic services such as health care, education, water supply; infrastructure such as communications, post and public transport; cultural services, including films, broadcasting, museums and libraries; as well as finance, retail, professional services and tourism. The commonly used definition of services is \"anything you can't drop on your foot\". The 160 sectors included under Gats account for most of the world's economy.</p> <p>The multinationals that stand to benefit were deeply involved in the negotiations to establish Gats. Lobbying by groups such as the US Coalition of Service Industries and the European Services Forum has kept up the pressure.</p> <p>Trade agreements on products have focused mainly on external barriers, such as tariffs. Gats is different. Most of the rules that are regarded as \"barriers to trade\" are local and national government rules and policies. Gats includes commercial presence in services, and has been described by the WTO as \"the world's first international investment agreement\". It includes many of the provisions of the failed Multilateral Agreement on Investment, which was abandoned after a strong civil society campaign.</p> <p>There are two types of provisions under Gats.

      "bodyText": "The United States does not grow many bananas. Yet under a virtually unknown trade agreement it won a case challenging the European Union's support for small Caribbean banana producers. The dispute was initiated under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (Gats), after pressure from banana-growing multinationals and a large donation from Chiquita to the Democratic party in the US. Bananas need to be distributed, and distribution is a service under Gats. Such is the scope of what has been termed the most important trade agreement since 1948. Negotiations begin this month on the extension of Gats. If powerful industry lobbies have their way, Gats would undermine the ability of governments to act in the interests of the poor, workers, consumers and vulnerable groups in society. These powers are being replaced by new rights for multinational companies. Government rules on the provision of services are at the heart of the way societies treat their citizens. In 1994 Gats was signed as part of the agreements that set up the World Trade Organisation (WTO). It includes basic services such as health care, education, water supply; infrastructure such as communications, post and public transport; cultural services, including films, broadcasting, museums and libraries; as well as finance, retail, professional services and tourism. The commonly used definition of services is \"anything you can't drop on your foot\". The 160 sectors included under Gats account for most of the world's economy. The multinationals that stand to benefit were deeply involved in the negotiations to establish Gats. Lobbying by groups such as the US Coalition of Service Industries and the European Services Forum has kept up the pressure. Trade agreements on products have focused mainly on external barriers, such as tariffs. Gats is different. Most of the rules that are regarded as \"barriers to trade\" are local and national government rules and policies. Gats includes commercial presence in services, and has been described by the WTO as \"the world's first international investment agreement\". It includes many of the provisions of the failed Multilateral Agreement on Investment, which was abandoned after a strong civil society campaign. There are two types of provisions under Gats. The first types are the commitments that governments make to open up their service industries. These are supposed to be voluntary offers, but in the real world they are not. Developing countries face unfair negotiations, complex agreements, tiny budgets and few government staff, and no assessment on the likely impacts of Gats. Their negotiators are coming under pressure to open up services in return for concessions on other unfair WTO agreements, such as in agriculture. There should be no trade-off. Developing countries should not be required to pay for the failure of agriculture policies in the rich world. The second types of provisions cover all service sectors. Included is the requirement that regulations should not be more burdensome than necessary (interpreted as burdensome on the corporations selling services). The WTO could have applied criteria to insist that regulations are \"as equitable as possible\" or \"as environmentally sound as possible\". But Gats elevates the interests of corporations above other aims. Governments claim that public services are safe because Gats excludes services provided \"under the exercise of government authority\". But Gats does apply if services are supplied commercially or in competition with the private sector. There are few service sectors in most countries that do not include some element of service provision by companies, such as in broadcasting, private medicine and education. The cornerstone of the agreement is a commitment to continuous liberalisation. Gats has a ratchet mechanism - governments can liberalise more, but not less.

The latest clashes began on Wednesday and took place 35 miles from previous incursions.</p> <p>\"The situation is horrible. They're shooting at our positions with various types of weapons. There is a major attack under way,\" said Stevo Pemdarovski, a spokesman for the Macedonian interior ministry.</p> <p>Around 200 ethnic Albanian rebels were reported to be involved in the fighting, which is taking place in and around the village of Larce. Mr Pemdarovski blamed the attacks on the National Liberation Army, an ethnic Albanian rebel group that emerged in Macedonia two months ago.</p> <p>\"We are at the brink of an explosion. I don't know what they have in mind, there may be attacks on other towns in Macedonia. We are there with all our forces _ but they have hand weapons, mortars and heavy weapons. They've built these up over a long period of time. These are not new ones.\"</p> <p>The spreading conflict casts doubt on Macedonian claims that the guerrilla groups did not have a solid base inside the country but were coming in from Kosovo.</p> <p>Last night fires began to burn in the wooded hills surrounding Tetovo and flares lit up the sky. Young men watched from the city's main square. \"We've been waiting for this moment for 40 years,\" said one man who refused to be named. \"We have nothing here, no work or any rights.\"</p> <p>Opposition to the ethnic Macedonian government has been strong among Tetovo's majority Albanians for a long time. Albanians make up over a quarter of the Macedonian population, but their language has yet to be given official recognition in the constitution.</p> <p>Further north, on Kosovo's eastern border, convoys of Serb military trucks and armoured personnel carriers churned into the Presevo valley at dawn yesterday, disgorging paratroopers and paramilitary police into wooded hills controlled by ethnic Albanian guerrillas.</p> <p>Nato peacekeepers watched from helicopters and observation posts as the Serbs plodded through fog and mud to reclaim the southern tip of the three-mile buffer zone created in June 1999 to separate the two armies.</p> <p>Since January last year ethnic Albanian extremists have exploited the vacuum to arm and train a guerrilla force - the Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac, known by its Albanian initials UCPMB - to bomb and shoot the lightly armed Serb police officers who patrolled the area, which is inside Serbia.</p> <p>From Ostrovica ridge, just inside Kosovo, Yugoslav army units could be seen waving flags and making three-fingered victory signs as they fanned into the countryside. Under terms agreed with Nato they cannot use tanks, enter villages nor fire first if confronted by rebels.</p> <p>Their task will be to cut rebel supply lines without repeating the atrocities committed two years ago against ethnic Albanian civilians. To demonstrate good faith, Slobodan Milosevic's successors named the mission Operation Peace.</p> <p>Belgrade and the guerrillas signed a 20-day ceasefire on Monday but few expect it to last that long. Several detonations, thought to be mortars, rocked the area two hours after the Serbs arrived but it was not known who fired.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Macedonia appeared to be on the brink of civil war last night as fighting between police and ethnic Albanian rebels erupted close to Tetovo, the country's second largest city, and threatened to ignite another Balkan conflagration. At least seven policemen were injured in the violence, which marks the spread of the ethnic Albanian insurgency into north-western Macedonia. Meanwhile, Yugoslav security forces, with Nato's consent, rolled into the buffer zone between Kosovo and Serbia yesterday to push back rebels who had occupied the Presevo valley. The artillery and machine gun fire which could be heard coming from hills a mile from Tetovo seemed to be getting closer to the city. The latest clashes began on Wednesday and took place 35 miles from previous incursions. \"The situation is horrible. They're shooting at our positions with various types of weapons. There is a major attack under way,\" said Stevo Pemdarovski, a spokesman for the Macedonian interior ministry. Around 200 ethnic Albanian rebels were reported to be involved in the fighting, which is taking place in and around the village of Larce. Mr Pemdarovski blamed the attacks on the National Liberation Army, an ethnic Albanian rebel group that emerged in Macedonia two months ago. \"We are at the brink of an explosion. I don't know what they have in mind, there may be attacks on other towns in Macedonia. We are there with all our forces _ but they have hand weapons, mortars and heavy weapons. They've built these up over a long period of time. These are not new ones.\" The spreading conflict casts doubt on Macedonian claims that the guerrilla groups did not have a solid base inside the country but were coming in from Kosovo. Last night fires began to burn in the wooded hills surrounding Tetovo and flares lit up the sky. Young men watched from the city's main square. \"We've been waiting for this moment for 40 years,\" said one man who refused to be named. \"We have nothing here, no work or any rights.\" Opposition to the ethnic Macedonian government has been strong among Tetovo's majority Albanians for a long time. Albanians make up over a quarter of the Macedonian population, but their language has yet to be given official recognition in the constitution. Further north, on Kosovo's eastern border, convoys of Serb military trucks and armoured personnel carriers churned into the Presevo valley at dawn yesterday, disgorging paratroopers and paramilitary police into wooded hills controlled by ethnic Albanian guerrillas. Nato peacekeepers watched from helicopters and observation posts as the Serbs plodded through fog and mud to reclaim the southern tip of the three-mile buffer zone created in June 1999 to separate the two armies. Since January last year ethnic Albanian extremists have exploited the vacuum to arm and train a guerrilla force - the Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac, known by its Albanian initials UCPMB - to bomb and shoot the lightly armed Serb police officers who patrolled the area, which is inside Serbia. From Ostrovica ridge, just inside Kosovo, Yugoslav army units could be seen waving flags and making three-fingered victory signs as they fanned into the countryside. Under terms agreed with Nato they cannot use tanks, enter villages nor fire first if confronted by rebels. Their task will be to cut rebel supply lines without repeating the atrocities committed two years ago against ethnic Albanian civilians. To demonstrate good faith, Slobodan Milosevic's successors named the mission Operation Peace. Belgrade and the guerrillas signed a 20-day ceasefire on Monday but few expect it to last that long. Several detonations, thought to be mortars, rocked the area two hours after the Serbs arrived but it was not known who fired.",

He added: \"Being given the chance to design for such an amazing house is a fabulous opportunity.\"</p> <p>The appointment was feted by Macdonald's celebrity fans. The singer Kylie Minogue, when told of the appointment as she was about to go the stage, said: \"His glittering aesthetic is a celebration of the female form - his devotion to glamour is absolute.\"</p> <p>The supermodel Jodie Kidd, one of Macdonalds favourite models and a close friend, said it was \"absolutely awesome, brilliant amazing news\". Speaking from Miami, where she is holidaying with friends, she added: \"He's a fantastic designer and he really deserves it. I'm very, very excited for him.\"</p> <p>But Macdonald's appointment is likely to attract sneers from some quarters. Not everyone feels that Macdonald, who currently designs a mini-collection for the Marks &amp; Spencer Autograph line and whose designs were called \"common\" by one prominent fashion critic last week, has the necessary gravitas for the venerable house of Givenchy, which celebrates its 50th anniversary next year.</p> <p>Undoubtedly, Macdonald's recent collections have sometimes been overshadowed by his showbiz sensibilities - one show featured a Michael Jackson lookalike in the front row, while last autumn's catwalk show featured Anna Nolan, then a media star through Channel 4's Big Brother, and a dress studded with \u00a3650,000 of De Beers diamonds.</p> <p>But Macdonald is a formidable design talent. He was born in Merthyr Tydfil, where his father still works in the town's Hoover factory, and studied at the Royal College of Art. While still a student he caught the eye of Karl Lagerfeld, who appointed him head knitwear designer for Chanel's couture and ready-to-wear collections. Macdonald's innovative cobweb knit techniques won critical acclaim, and in 1997, aged just 24, he designed Chanel's best-selling outfit of the year.</p> <p>In the same year Macdonald launched his own name label. Later that year, he staged his first runway show. Among those who turned up to show support was a fellow young British designer, Alexander McQueen.</p> <p>In a strange twist, it is McQueen who Macdonald replaces at Givenchy. Since the retirement of its founder, Givenchy has a history of appointing British designers: before McQueen, the post was held by John Galliano, now at Christian Dior.</p> <p><b> Untenable</b><br></p> <p>McQueen's position has been virtually untenable since late last year when he sold a majority stake in his own name label to Gucci Group, the arch-rivals of Givenchy's owners, LVMH. An increasingly visible split between designer and house led to the radical downsizing of January's couture show and of tomorrow's ready-to-wear show, which will be McQueen's last at Givenchy.</p> <p>\"I am really excited about his [Macdonald's] appointment\", said the president of Givenchy, Marianne Tesler, yesterday. \"His design sensibility is very representative of the Givenchy woman - classy, modern, elegant, sexy and feminine.\"</p> <p>Myron Ullman, managing director of LVMH, added: \"The talent and taste of this young designer correspond ideally to the Givenchy clientele.\"</p> <p>The house of Givenchy, proud of its links with Audrey Hepburn, is no doubt hoping that Julien Macdonald's \"sparkly dresses\" will bring a new generation of glamorous Hollywood stars into the Givenchy fold.</p> <p>The timing of yesterday's announcement could not have been more Machiavellian. Not only did it succeed in further undermining McQueen's final show for Givenchy - heralding his successor before his last collection has even been unveiled - it was leaked just as the audience was assembling for the Yves Saint Laurent show, the centrepiece of the Paris fashion week calender for Gucci Group.</p> <p>It has not yet been confirmed when the Welsh designer will take up his new post. However, a Givenchy spokeswoman, Katie Weisman, said that \"the logical thing\" would be for Macdonald to make his Givenchy debut at the July couture shows. A spokeswoman for Marks &amp; Spencer said Macdonald's contract to design another collection for the store chain still held \"as far as we know\", although Givenchy may be less than keen on their head designer moonlighting on the high street.</p> <p>It is likely that Macdonald's new post will also mean forfeiting his own name label for the time being - a blow for London Fashion Week.</p> <p>Alexander McQueen, the departing Givenchy designer, speaking from the front row of the show by Yves Saint Laurent, a stablemate of his label at the Gucci Group, said only: \"Good luck to him.\"</p> <p><b>Designers abroad</b><br></p> <p>\u0095 John Galliano - First appointed to LVMH-owned Givenchy in 1995, promoted to designer at Christian Dior in 1996, succeeding Gianfranco Ferre. He has since turned the label into one of the most controversial but successful brands of its type. Galliano also designs his own label, which is shown in Paris.</p> <p>\u0095 Alexander McQueen - The outgoing talent behind Givenchy, the British Designer of the Year is rumoured to be showing from next season in Milan. This follows the acquisition of his own label company by the Gucci Group.</p> <p>\u0095 Stella McCartney - The powerhouse behind Parisian label Chloe, Stella has confounded critics since her appointment in 1997. In her time at the label, she has more than tripled sales. Rumours suggest McCartney will soon leave Chloe to set up her own label in Paris.</p> <p>\u0095 Hussein Chalayan - Chalayan has just designed his last collection for US label TSE New York. His own label currently in voluntary liquidation, it is rumoured that Chalayan will show abroad when he returns to the fashion schedule next season.</p> <p>\u0095Antonio Berardi - A contemporary of McQueen, Berardi designs for the Italian label Exte. Although his shows used to be one of the highlights of London Fashion Week, he now presents his collections in Milan.</p> <p>\u0095 Clements Ribeiro - The husband and wife design duo Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro have been behind the revival of French label Cacherel for the past two seasons. They also show their own line collection in London.</p> <p>\u0095 Giles Deacon - The little-known young London designer has been transforming Italian label Bottega Veneta into one of the must-see shows of the Milan calendar. The make-over has been such a success, a majority stake in the company has been bought by Gucci Group.</p> <p>\u0095 Luella Bartley - The 27-year-old London-based designer, this season decamped to Milan to show her hit eponymous collection at the Bottega Veneta headquarters. By showing abroad, Bartley found the costs were much lower than they would be for putting on a catwalk presentation in London. <br><b>Charlie Porter</b></p>",

I'm very, very excited for him.\" But Macdonald's appointment is likely to attract sneers from some quarters. Not everyone feels that Macdonald, who currently designs a mini-collection for the Marks &amp; Spencer Autograph line and whose designs were called \"common\" by one prominent fashion critic last week, has the necessary gravitas for the venerable house of Givenchy, which celebrates its 50th anniversary next year. Undoubtedly, Macdonald's recent collections have sometimes been overshadowed by his showbiz sensibilities - one show featured a Michael Jackson lookalike in the front row, while last autumn's catwalk show featured Anna Nolan, then a media star through Channel 4's Big Brother, and a dress studded with \u00a3650,000 of De Beers diamonds. But Macdonald is a formidable design talent. He was born in Merthyr Tydfil, where his father still works in the town's Hoover factory, and studied at the Royal College of Art. While still a student he caught the eye of Karl Lagerfeld, who appointed him head knitwear designer for Chanel's couture and ready-to-wear collections. Macdonald's innovative cobweb knit techniques won critical acclaim, and in 1997, aged just 24, he designed Chanel's best-selling outfit of the year. In the same year Macdonald launched his own name label. Later that year, he staged his first runway show. Among those who turned up to show support was a fellow young British designer, Alexander McQueen. In a strange twist, it is McQueen who Macdonald replaces at Givenchy. Since the retirement of its founder, Givenchy has a history of appointing British designers: before McQueen, the post was held by John Galliano, now at Christian Dior. Untenable McQueen's position has been virtually untenable since late last year when he sold a majority stake in his own name label to Gucci Group, the arch-rivals of Givenchy's owners, LVMH. An increasingly visible split between designer and house led to the radical downsizing of January's couture show and of tomorrow's ready-to-wear show, which will be McQueen's last at Givenchy. \"I am really excited about his [Macdonald's] appointment\", said the president of Givenchy, Marianne Tesler, yesterday. \"His design sensibility is very representative of the Givenchy woman - classy, modern, elegant, sexy and feminine.\" Myron Ullman, managing director of LVMH, added: \"The talent and taste of this young designer correspond ideally to the Givenchy clientele.\" The house of Givenchy, proud of its links with Audrey Hepburn, is no doubt hoping that Julien Macdonald's \"sparkly dresses\" will bring a new generation of glamorous Hollywood stars into the Givenchy fold. The timing of yesterday's announcement could not have been more Machiavellian. Not only did it succeed in further undermining McQueen's final show for Givenchy - heralding his successor before his last collection has even been unveiled - it was leaked just as the audience was assembling for the Yves Saint Laurent show, the centrepiece of the Paris fashion week calender for Gucci Group. It has not yet been confirmed when the Welsh designer will take up his new post. However, a Givenchy spokeswoman, Katie Weisman, said that \"the logical thing\" would be for Macdonald to make his Givenchy debut at the July couture shows. A spokeswoman for Marks &amp; Spencer said Macdonald's contract to design another collection for the store chain still held \"as far as we know\", although Givenchy may be less than keen on their head designer moonlighting on the high street. It is likely that Macdonald's new post will also mean forfeiting his own name label for the time being - a blow for London Fashion Week. Alexander McQueen, the departing Givenchy designer, speaking from the front row of the show by Yves Saint Laurent, a stablemate of his label at the Gucci Group, said only: \"Good luck to him.\" Designers abroad \u0095 John Galliano - First appointed to LVMH-owned Givenchy in 1995, promoted to designer at Christian Dior in 1996, succeeding Gianfranco Ferre. He has since turned the label into one of the most controversial but successful brands of its type. Galliano also designs his own label, which is shown in Paris. \u0095 Alexander McQueen - The outgoing talent behind Givenchy, the British Designer of the Year is rumoured to be showing from next season in Milan. This follows the acquisition of his own label company by the Gucci Group. \u0095 Stella McCartney - The powerhouse behind Parisian label Chloe, Stella has confounded critics since her appointment in 1997. In her time at the label, she has more than tripled sales. Rumours suggest McCartney will soon leave Chloe to set up her own label in Paris. \u0095 Hussein Chalayan - Chalayan has just designed his last collection for US label TSE New York. His own label currently in voluntary liquidation, it is rumoured that Chalayan will show abroad when he returns to the fashion schedule next season. \u0095Antonio Berardi - A contemporary of McQueen, Berardi designs for the Italian label Exte. Although his shows used to be one of the highlights of London Fashion Week, he now presents his collections in Milan. \u0095 Clements Ribeiro - The husband and wife design duo Suzanne Clements and Inacio Ribeiro have been behind the revival of French label Cacherel for the past two seasons. They also show their own line collection in London. \u0095 Giles Deacon - The little-known young London designer has been transforming Italian label Bottega Veneta into one of the must-see shows of the Milan calendar. The make-over has been such a success, a majority stake in the company has been bought by Gucci Group. \u0095 Luella Bartley - The 27-year-old London-based designer, this season decamped to Milan to show her hit eponymous collection at the Bottega Veneta headquarters. By showing abroad, Bartley found the costs were much lower than they would be for putting on a catwalk presentation in London. Charlie Porter",

They cost her \u00a314.73 for seven. </p> <p>Strangwayes-Booth is exactly the kind of person the Department of Health hopes will give up smoking for good. Yesterday - No Smoking Day - the public health minister, Yvette Cooper, announced that nicotine replacement therapies (NRT) would soon be available via NHS prescriptions. </p> <p>The new policy, starting at the end of April, will cost the government between \u00a310m and \u00a340m a year - pennies compared with the \u00a31.7bn that the NHS spends on smokers annually. It means that GPs will be able to prescribe NRT products such as nicotine patches, gum and inhalers to smokers who want to quit. It will be up to individual GPs to decide who gets what, but those recipients will be benefiting financially. One \u00a36 prescription will be enough for two weeks' supply. At the same time, some NRT products will be made available at supermarkets. </p> <p>Strangwayes-Booth, a receptionist at Goldcrest Films in London, is impressed by the plan. \"I think it's a really good idea for the NHS to try to help people stop smoking, and I would definitely go to my doctor to get a prescription,\" she says. \"It's also sensible to be able to buy patches or gum at the same places you can buy cigarettes, rather than have to go to a chemist.\" </p> <p>The plans are part of New Labour's heavy emphasis on public health. Its 1998 white paper introduced a multitude of targets, from healthy eating to cutting heart disease, including three aimed at cutting down smoking. A fourth anti-smoking target, aimed particularly at the poorly paid, was added as part of the NHS cancer plan. Its target is a reduction in the number of smokers among manually skilled workers from 32% to 26% by 2010. </p> <p>\"NRT will be available on prescription, because research shows that it doubles the chance of people giving up smoking,\" says an NHS spokesman. \"But it's also because we particularly need to help people in lower-income groups. They tend to smoke more and may find the cost of NRT prohibitive.\" </p> <p>But this doubled success rate only applies if you are ready to stop. Taking NRT cannot make you more committed to giving up smoking or transform you into a non-smoker, although it can help end the psychological habit of reaching for a cigarette. </p> <p>Professor John Britton, a consultant in respiratory medicine at Nottingham city hospital, admits that many smokers simply cannot quit. Over the course of a year, he says, only around a fifth of those who try to give up manage to do so permanently. And that includes those who go by his favoured method - using nicotine replacement therapy and getting behavioural support. </p> <p>\"NRT is not enough on its own. When you're trying to stop smoking, you need to be taught ways of dealing with times when having a cigarette seems like a good idea.\" </p> <p>Mary Ostle would second that. A heavy smoker for 35 years, she was getting through 25 to 30 cigarettes a day before deciding to quit last November. But Ostle, a nurse from Middleton St George, near Darlington, says it was preparation that helped her. </p> <p>\"So much more needs to be done for smokers. I managed to give up through determination, by knowing that having a cup of coffee made me want a cigarette, so not drinking coffee any more. But more support is needed. There aren't nearly enough smoking cessation clinics.\" </p> <p>She tried a Nicorette Inhalator, but says she only used it around four or five times. \"I didn't find it a lot of help,\" she says. \"It was kind of a prop, something to carry around, and it was very expensive. I'm sure many people wonder why they should spend money on that when they can buy a packet of fags for less money and enjoy themselves.\" </p> <p>Because of this, she is convinced that the government's plans are exactly what are needed. \"I'm sure this will be a success,\" she says. \"But it's about time it happened.\" </p> <p>\"I've been calling for this for years,\" says Britton. \"NRT is an extremely efficient clinical treatment which saves lives and doesn't cost much money. It hasn't made sense to deny it to those who are addicted. Other addicts get help. Why shouldn't those addicted to nicotine?\" </p> <p>In addition, he says, nicotine replacement therapy is a safe way to try to give up. The treatments work by giving people the nicotine they are addicted to, but in a way that is safe and controlled. </p> <p>\"There's a misconception about the dangers of smoking,\" he says. \"People think that it's nicotine that causes cancer, but that's not true. Cigarettes are dangerous because of the other things in them. It's the tar and other products of the cigarette which cause the harm.\" In other words, people smoke for the addictive nicotine, but it is not the most damaging substance. </p> <p>\"A cigarette delivers nicotine into your blood and that goes into your brain directly,\" says Britton. \"It's all very quick. The nicotine replacements don't work like that. You take them in through your skin, your mouth or your nose and they have to go right round your body to get to your brain. It's diluted and that's safer.\" </p> <p>Strangwayes-Booth is keen to try out her new patch. \"I really want to give up smoking this time,\" she says. \"But I haven't been to the pub yet. The patch will be coming with me, when I do, and I really hope it works.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>British director <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Boyle,+Danny\">Danny Boyle</a> has signed to direct the high-concept thriller Tick-Tock for Columbia studios. The Los Angeles-based production takes the <a href=\"/Film/Film_Page/0,4061,34879,00.html\">Trainspotting</a> director out of his native UK and possibly signals a split with regular collaborators <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Macdonald,+Andrew+(I)\">Andrew Macdonald</a> and <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Hodge,+John+(I)\">John Hodge</a>. </p> <p>Tick-Tock, which plays out in real time during one afternoon in the run-up to Christmas, tells the tale of an amnesiac who is forced to assist an FBI agent in tracking down a series of bombs that are planted in shopping malls around LA. Meanwhile, the amnesiac struggles to regain his memory and work out whether he actually planted the devices.

      "bodyText": "British director Danny Boyle has signed to direct the high-concept thriller Tick-Tock for Columbia studios. The Los Angeles-based production takes the Trainspotting director out of his native UK and possibly signals a split with regular collaborators Andrew Macdonald and John Hodge. Tick-Tock, which plays out in real time during one afternoon in the run-up to Christmas, tells the tale of an amnesiac who is forced to assist an FBI agent in tracking down a series of bombs that are planted in shopping malls around LA. Meanwhile, the amnesiac struggles to regain his memory and work out whether he actually planted the devices. The script was written by Charles Mondry and Anthony Bagarozzi, who thrashed out the idea while working at Tower Video in LA's Orange County. Last year Boyle served as the director on two TV plays - Strumpet and Vacuuming Completely Nude in Paradise - that were written by Jim Cartwright. But Tick-Tock will be his first feature film without producer Macdonald and writer Hodge. Boyle, Macdonald and Hodge first came to fame with the Scottish noir Shallow Grave in 1995, then followed that up with the mammoth critical and commercial hit Trainspotting the following year. But in recent years the trio have shown signs of strain. They suffered their first flop with 1997's A Life Less Ordinary and were reportedly stung by the controversy and negative critical response to their ambitious, American-funded backpacker saga The Beach, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

      "bodyText": "Newspaper giant Trinity Mirror is putting its ic24 internet service provider up for sale and is slashing its online spending in a bid to turn around its sluggish performance. The publisher of the Mirror and the Birmingham Post, which spent \u00a342.3m on internet ventures last year, will cut its planned three-year internet spending from \u00a3150m to \u00a390m after admitting revenues were \"significantly below expectations\". Trinity's stock has underperformed the media sector by 30% since it merged with the Mirror group 18 months ago, and investors have been clamouring for a shift in strategy. The ic24 operation will be put up for sale in a market that is extremely wary of internet companies, but analysts expect Trinity to recoup the \u00a325m it has invested in the service. European internet firms T-Online and Tiscali are both looking for a way into the lucrative UK market and are early favourites to bid for ic24, which had 250,000 subscribers. However, the news came as Trinity Mirror announced strong growth in its core newspaper business and said the fragile advertising market was holding up well. The UK's largest newspaper publisher said pre-tax profit before digital investment was \u00a3196.4m last year, compared with \u00a3175.1m for 1999. Turnover rose from \u00a3995m to \u00a31.05bn. Newspaper publishers have been fighting the twin demons of escalating newspaper print prices and falling advertising revenues, but Trinity said it remained confident about the company's prospects over the next 12 months. \"The sharp rise in newspaper print prices was an unhelpful start to the year. However, advertising in the national titles has improved significantly and recruitment advertising in the regional newspapers has remained strong since the beginning of the year,\" the group said. Trinity has been best by management clashes, the City Slickers scandal which threatened to engulf Mirror editor Piers Morgan, and the task of integrating the Mirror titles. On top of this, there have been wider concerns about the health of the advertising market and rising newspaper print prices. Investors gave Trinity's announcement the thumbs up in early trading, marking its shares up nearly 3% to 473p.",

The internal Labour party investigation, set up by the NEC, took place in 1994 over claims of irregularities in the membership of Mr Vaz's Leicester East Labour party and allegations that he had tried to interfere in city council business and bullied party members.

      "bodyText": "A hijacked Russian passenger plane carrying 174 passengers and crew has landed in Saudi Arabia, hours after being taken over by two men armed with knives. The hijackers - believed to be Chechen - took control of the Vnukovo Airlines flight shortly after its take off from the Turkish capital, Istanbul. The flight was bound for Moscow. Qatar-based al-Jazeera television said the plane had landed in the Muslim holy city of Medina in Saudi Arabia. An airport official told the television station by telephone: \"The plane has landed at Prince Mohammed bin Abdel Aziz airport.\" Saudi authorities have begun negotiations with the hijackers. Of the 12 crew members on board, one was injured in the takeover, according to the Turkish transport minister, Enis Oksuz. One of the pilots is reported to have struggled with the hijackers. The pilot of the hijacked aircraft, which entered Egyptian airspace at 3.45 (13.45 GMT), told civil aviation authorities at Cairo airport that the plane was heading to Medina, Saudi Arabia. Anxiety gripped relatives and friends waiting at Vnukovo airport for loved ones to arrive from Turkey, as confusing information about the incident blared from TV sets and official announcements. Two planes from Istanbul were due in at Vnukovo at about the same time, and many people did not know whether their friends and family members had taken the one that was seized. \"I'm shaking all over,\" said Alexander, a 26-year-old man who did not give his surname as he sat in an airport cafeteria holding a red rose for his wife. Turkey is a favourite destination for Russian tourists and for so-called shuttle traders who take advantage of cheap flights to travel to Istanbul and load up on inexpensive goods, especially clothes and leather coats. The flights are often last minute deals, with flight information available only just before departure. The plane took off at 1.30pm (11.30 GMT) from Istanbul's Ataturk international airport. The two hijackers took over the plane 30 minutes later, Turkey's Anatolia news agency reported. Russia has long accused Turkey of supporting Chechen rebels, and Chechens injured in fighting against Russian forces have been treated in Turkish hospitals. Turkey and Russia recently signed an agreement to co-operate in the battle against terrorism after Turkey reportedly promised to stop all support to the Chechens.

The popularity of sitting in the living room and having a spontaneous flutter on sporting events is gaining momentum. Since launching its interactive TV betting service in December, Open has already registered more than 20,000 customers. The service is more appealing to women who have traditionally disliked going into bookmakers' shops. However, it is not just women who are intimidated by betting shops. According to the survey, 40% of people surveyed said they did not feel confident about walking into a high street bookmaker to place a bet. Surprisingly, one in three men also admitted to lacking confidence when in the local bookie. The purchase of lottery tickets though interactive services is also set to become big business. A significant 40% of people surveyed said they would buy lottery tickets over the internet or interactive TV if the option was available. Orbis, the company that provides online betting software to the likes of Ladbrokes, Littlewoods and Blue Square, conducted the survey. \"Imagine sitting down to watch the FA Cup Final with your mates, and being able to bet from your TV remote control on whether David Beckham will get the next penalty goal,\" said Charles Malir, marketing director at Orbis. \"The appeal for this kind of fun betting will be huge,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p>This is the journey of Ibrahim Sabah yesterday, on the day the science student was to have started spring term at Bir Zeit University. He left his village near the West Bank city of Hebron at 6am by shared taxi, and rode as far as Bethlehem, changing cars at the first of six Israeli army roadblocks along his route. From Bethlehem, he drove north through Azariya, on the edges of Jerusalem, and then passed through Ramallah, and Surda, before the final yellow taxi deposited him at the gates of Bir Zeit.</p> <p>At each station along his route, he got out of the car and made his way past heaps of earth piled on the road, concrete barricades, Israeli soldiers and the occasional tank, to fight for a place in the next taxi. At the last stop he trudged over a road torn up by Israeli army bulldozers, all within range of an Israeli army machine-gun nest. Sabah's total travel time yesterday: 4.5 hours. Total distance travelled: 40km.</p> <p>When the Israeli army laid siege to Bir Zeit this week, breaking up a 400 metre strip of pavement and digging two trenches three metres deep on the road connecting the university to Ramallah, they were simply replicating a policy of containment that has unfolded gradually over the past six months of penning the Palestinians into ever smaller enclosures. The trenches outside Bir Zeit also cut off more than 30 villages and 65,000 civilians from the commercial and political hub of West Bank life in Ramallah. They also damaged phone lines and water pipes.</p> <p>But that has gone largely unnoticed because in extending the siege to the cam pus of Bir Zeit, Israel's hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon, committed a monumental blunder: he underestimated the enormous influence the foremost Palestinian academic institution exercises on the local population, and the outside world. International opinon - which has been relatively muted on Israel's siege of West Bank towns and Gaza - was immediately mobilised on Bir Zeit's behalf, and a campus that has stayed on the sidelines of this intifada burst on to centrestage.</p> <p>For the Palestinians, the siege of Bir Zeit went far beyond Israel's flimsy pretext of a security alert against potential car bombers; it represented an attempt to snuff out an institution that was a potent symbol of aspiration long before the intifada erupted six months ago. \"According to them, the blockade is for security reasons, but I think they want to paralyse academic life and put pressure on the university,\" says Sabah.</p> <p>The Palestinians are the most educated people in the Arab world and Bir Zeit, the oldest - and reputedly the best university in the West Bank and Gaza - epitomises their ambitions, on both personal and national levels. \"It is one of the very strong bastions of democratic institutions, with a fairly good academic standard,\" says Dr Hanna Nasir, the university president. \"It spearheaded the whole issue of higher education under the occupation.\"</p> <p>It did so through turbulent times, marked by strikes, sit-ins, leaflet campaigns, protests and enforced shutdowns during the 70s and 80s which were led by the mainstream nationalist Fatah movement of Yasser Arafat. Until the arrival of limited self-rule six years ago, there were frequent clashes with the Israeli soldiers posted at the gates of the hilltop campus. During the last intifada, in the late 80s, Israel closed down the university for more than four years.</p> <p>Along the way, Bir Zeit produced a generation of leaders who occupy key positions in the Palestinian political and academic establishment. Prominent alumni include Marwan Barghouti, a leader of the Fatah militias in the West Bank, who has emerged as a leading field commander of this intifada. Barghouti was a student leader at Bir Zeit in the 70s and 80s before he was deported by Israel. But he earned an MA in history.</p> <p>\"Bir Zeit always used to be in the lead in confrontations and fights,\" says Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian analyst who was a student leader at Bir Zeit in the late 70s. That has not been the case during this uprising, which has been fought largely by the armed cells of Fatah, shooting at Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers.</p> <p>The stone-throwing demonstrations of the first few weeks of the uprising faded away, partly because of Israel's brutal response, which saw as many as 19 demonstrators killed in a day. More than 420 people have been killed to date, mostly Palestinians.</p> <p>But the Palestinians' resort to firearms - the most marked change from the last uprising - also stopped the uprising from developing into a genuine mass movement. \"The whole intifada has changed. The involvement of the people was much more in the first intifada,\" says Vera Tamari, who teaches Islamic art and architecture. \"Now the confrontation is localised in specific locations, and not all sectors are involved.\"</p> <p>With the withdrawal of Israeli troops from its gates several years ago, the campus ceased to be a flashpoint. Meanwhile, a new generation of students came of age, too young to remember the first intifada, who championed a peace process which failed to deliver any discernible benefits. Now the next generation of activists has emerged. During the past few years, Hamas and other Islamist organisations have won the student council elections, dislodging Fatah. But although Bir Zeit has been sidelined of late, several of the students who battled their way to the hilltop 5kms north of Ramallah which houses Bir Zeit's new campus yesterday, said they were drawn to the university as much for its tradition of activism, as for its academic reputation.</p> <p>\"It has a reputation for being a place of activists,\" says Awali Samara, who moved here from Brooklyn in August to begin an MA in democracy and human rights. A Jerusalemite, it was her first time back since emigrating to the US in 1985. \"I felt that when I registered here, I would not just be studying human rights, but I would be living it, too,\" she said. \"You could see the fact of the occupation, but at night we would go out and it was not that much different from New York. Now it has become all too real.\"</p> <p>Early yesterday morning, after the Israeli forces left the trench and retreated to an overlooking slope, it was the turn of Palestinian bulldozers to move huge mounds of rubble around the sole road linking Bir Zeit to Ramallah. They rumbled over a pavement scored and broken by Israeli earth-moving equipment at the weekend. By mid-morning the road was open to traffic again, and cars scraped their undercarriages over the dirt mounds that filled in two Israeli trenches. By afternoon, a few hundred protesters had planted Palestinian flags in the earth, and some were throwing stones. The Israeli army jeeps retreated to a slope behind a concrete barrier, firing rubber-tipped steel bullets in their wake. Bir Zeit, the erstwhile centre of Palestinian political life, had been activated once more.</p> <p>\"What happened this week is not over,\" Nasir says. \"It's going to linger like a bad cold.\" Although classes will restart on Saturday, several teachers at Bir Zeit fear the loss of further students because of the newly installed Israeli military checkpoint. They see the checkpoint as a provocation, luring the students of Bir Zeit into clashes with the Israeli soldiers stationed there.</p> <p>Other students will stay away for fear of having to pass the Israeli troops. About 800 of Bir Zeit's students have dropped out since the start of the intifada, exhausted by an Israeli siege that has turned travel between Palestinian cities into a nightmare. Some 300 other students are stranded, unable to return to their homes in the Gaza Strip because Israel's blockade means they might never be able to return to finish their degrees. Others face arrest for leaving Gaza without Israel's permission.</p> <p>When the Israeli checkpoint went up this week, their world, already constrained by the blockades in the West Bank, drastically shrank. \"Now I can't even go to Ramallah 5km away,\" says Fahdi Omar. A final year engineering student, he smuggled himself out of Gaza to Egypt and then to Jordan before enrolling at Bir Zeit five years ago, and has not returned to visit his family since because that would involve crossing Israel, and possible arrest. \"Personally, I don't mind if I get caught, but my being here means everything for my family,\" he says.</p> <p>Research trips to Jerusalem and other cities are impossible because of the blockade, and several of the staff have been blocked from going to conferences abroad because Israel will not let them use its airport. But, until this week, it appeared that the Bir Zeit would concentrate on its real business of education.</p> <p>\"There was a false sense of normality for a while. The occupation was not as militaristic as it has been over the past 34 years - at least in Bir Zeit,\" Tamari says. \"Now the situation is in limbo - neither occupation nor liberation, neither autonomy nor living under Israel. It is very difficult for us to cope.\"</p>",

Why is it that, in a country in which half the children do not go to school, oil wealth is deepening the misery?</p> <p>The simple answer is an explosive combination of poor domestic governance and unregulated foreign business.</p> <p>Christian Aid's partner organisations in Sudan have reported that the atrocities have increased since oil came on-stream in 1999. The 18-year civil war between central government and armed opposition groups based in the south has already caused more than 2m deaths and 4m internally displaced.</p> <p>Since 1998, the government has doubled its military budget, spending virtually what it receives in oil revenues - around $1m a day. In December, the minister for roads and transport in Southern province resigned in frustration at the lack of resources for development, saying oil revenues were intensifying the war in the south.</p> <p>Before oil, Sudan produced few weapons, now it has two manufacturing sites which, by the government's own admission, were set up for dual civilian-military use.</p> <p>One general has boasted that Sudan is increasing its domestic arms production thanks largely to the \"unprecedented economic boom\" that oil revenues have caused.</p> <p>Unfortunately, there are no benefits to be enjoyed by the poor in either the north or south of the country.</p> <p>The civil war is being fought over complex issues of identity and culture among diverse African and Arab peoples and over control of natural resources such as land and livestock.</p> <p>But now it is increasingly being fought over oil and any lasting peace agreement will need to ensure a fair distribution of resources and development for all.</p> <p>But as long as the oil revenues promote the burnings of homes and mass displacement and are not invested in Sudan's children and social services, they will contribute to the \"de-development\" of the country.</p> <p>The foreign oil companies in Sudan are choosing to wall themselves off from these realities. Many, such as Talisman (Canada), Lundin (Sweden) and CNPC (China), are complicit in the atrocities through their inaction.</p> <p>Roads and airstrips which are part of the oil infrastructure are used by the military in the campaign of destruction. The same troops providing security to the companies have committed human rights atrocities.</p> <p>The companies' presence provides not only the resources but lends international legitimacy to a government at war with its own people.</p> <p>Christian Aid and our partners in Sudan are calling on the oil companies to cease operations immediately, sending a strong signal to the government.</p> <p>Companies can use their influence to help stop human rights violations. It is about time they did.</p> <p>Mark Curtis is head of advocacy at Christian Aid</p>",

The simple answer is an explosive combination of poor domestic governance and unregulated foreign business. Christian Aid's partner organisations in Sudan have reported that the atrocities have increased since oil came on-stream in 1999. The 18-year civil war between central government and armed opposition groups based in the south has already caused more than 2m deaths and 4m internally displaced. Since 1998, the government has doubled its military budget, spending virtually what it receives in oil revenues - around $1m a day. In December, the minister for roads and transport in Southern province resigned in frustration at the lack of resources for development, saying oil revenues were intensifying the war in the south. Before oil, Sudan produced few weapons, now it has two manufacturing sites which, by the government's own admission, were set up for dual civilian-military use. One general has boasted that Sudan is increasing its domestic arms production thanks largely to the \"unprecedented economic boom\" that oil revenues have caused. Unfortunately, there are no benefits to be enjoyed by the poor in either the north or south of the country. The civil war is being fought over complex issues of identity and culture among diverse African and Arab peoples and over control of natural resources such as land and livestock. But now it is increasingly being fought over oil and any lasting peace agreement will need to ensure a fair distribution of resources and development for all. But as long as the oil revenues promote the burnings of homes and mass displacement and are not invested in Sudan's children and social services, they will contribute to the \"de-development\" of the country. The foreign oil companies in Sudan are choosing to wall themselves off from these realities. Many, such as Talisman (Canada), Lundin (Sweden) and CNPC (China), are complicit in the atrocities through their inaction. Roads and airstrips which are part of the oil infrastructure are used by the military in the campaign of destruction. The same troops providing security to the companies have committed human rights atrocities. The companies' presence provides not only the resources but lends international legitimacy to a government at war with its own people. Christian Aid and our partners in Sudan are calling on the oil companies to cease operations immediately, sending a strong signal to the government. Companies can use their influence to help stop human rights violations. It is about time they did. Mark Curtis is head of advocacy at Christian Aid",

      "bodyText": "Ericsson is pulling its investment in sports sponsorship in the UK in order to concentrate on music and youth-based initiatives. The Swedish mobile phone giant's sponsorship of QPR football club and the Wasps rugby club will not be renewed when the contracts run out at the end of this season. Ericsson has sponsored QPR for five years and Wasps for three years. It will maintain a relationship with the rugby club by becoming and associate sponsor - its logo will appear on the players' shirtsleeves. \"Our relationships with Wasps and QPR has been very successful - they have given us a profile and continuity with the public - but we are focusing more on music this year,\" said Alex Rodrigues, marketing director of Ericsson UK. Mr Rodrigues was unable to say whether Ericsson was to stop investing in sport on a global basis. This year, Ericsson will sponsor the Homelands dance music festival for the third time. It has sponsored the Muzik magazine awards and later this year will sponsor the MTV Europe awards. A raft of marketing activity is being planned around the June release of the Tomb Raider film, in which Erissson products feature. Vijay Anand, the UK marketer responsible for putting together Ericsson's partnership with dance music brands, has recently been appointed to the newly created role of global youth marketing chief.",

Meanwhile, Sian Rees has been appointed lifestyle director. She previously worked as deputy editor of Project Florence, the G+J women's lifestyle title that was shelved after the publisher was bought by the National Magazine Company. Project Helena's deputy editor will be Karen Pasquali-Jones, a former Sunday People and Today journalist. Lindsay Maggs, who has worked at the Times and the Daily Mail, comes on board as picture editor. They join former That's Life editor Janice Turner, who is launch-editing the magazine. \"The existing women's glossies are beautiful to look at but they only take about five minutes to flick through and have absolutely no relevance to women's lives,\" said Ms Turner. \"Throughout our extensive research, all the women we spoke to said the same thing - 'we want a glossy women's magazine that gives us something to READ'.\" The magazine has been shrouded in secrecy. Staff at H Bauer's headquarters said the Project Helena office had been sealed off from the rest of the building. The magazine's name has been kept strictly under wraps. However, industry sources claim the working title is Real. A spokesman for the magazine said this was one of many working titles. The magazine, which will be the first fortnightly glossy to hit the market, is backed by serious investment from H Bauer, the German publishing firm. It is the latest in a long line of magazine launches to enter the lucrative \"middle youth\" sector. In the past two years, Emap Elan's Red, the BBC's first women's glossy Eve, Dennis Publishing's PS and IPC's Nova have all appeared in the market. More recently, Time Inc and Conde Nast have introduced UK versions of the high-profile US magazines InStyle and Glamour.",

      "body": "<p>The government has today published the long-awaited adoption bill - it has been suggested that this will be a substantial piece of new legislation with more than 100 clauses. </p> <p>I have to admit that it is quite a surprise, given the proximity of the general election and the likelihood of the bill becoming law this session being unlikely to say the least.</p> <p>Nevertheless, this is a welcome and important move and will allow the prime minister's promise, made at question time in the heat of the internet adoption saga, to be realised.</p> <p>Perhaps less charitable commentators may reflect on the fact that it has taken a high profile case causing public outrage to get the government into gear to deliver at last the key plank of the adoption agenda.</p> <p>But it does not matter what the trigger was - the government has already demonstrated its commitment to reforming adoption services through the prime minister's report and the white paper published just before Christmas. </p> <p>What is important now is that we have a \"once in a generation\" opportunity to ensure that we have the adoption legislation on the statute book which we hope will really meet the needs of children (the last major amendment to 1958 adoption legislation was in the 1975 Children Act). </p> <p>Much has been written about the government's wish to rehabilitate adoption in the eyes of the public, in order to encourage more confidence in the system.

      "bodyText": "The government has today published the long-awaited adoption bill - it has been suggested that this will be a substantial piece of new legislation with more than 100 clauses. I have to admit that it is quite a surprise, given the proximity of the general election and the likelihood of the bill becoming law this session being unlikely to say the least. Nevertheless, this is a welcome and important move and will allow the prime minister's promise, made at question time in the heat of the internet adoption saga, to be realised. Perhaps less charitable commentators may reflect on the fact that it has taken a high profile case causing public outrage to get the government into gear to deliver at last the key plank of the adoption agenda. But it does not matter what the trigger was - the government has already demonstrated its commitment to reforming adoption services through the prime minister's report and the white paper published just before Christmas. What is important now is that we have a \"once in a generation\" opportunity to ensure that we have the adoption legislation on the statute book which we hope will really meet the needs of children (the last major amendment to 1958 adoption legislation was in the 1975 Children Act). Much has been written about the government's wish to rehabilitate adoption in the eyes of the public, in order to encourage more confidence in the system. Fears have been expressed that the simplistic drive to adoption, backed up by quantitative targets, can only reduce the opportunity for disadvantaged and struggling parents to care successfully for their own children, with appropriate support. I doubt however whether this will be the case with the impact of the Human Rights Act and a stated government commitment to family support.

      "byline": "Linda Steele",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Why an adoption bill now?</strong><br> Right this minute? Well, the hooha over the case of the American \"internet twins\" bought over the internet by Welsh couple Alan and Judith Kilshaw made adoption a watercooler issue and made ministers determined to be seen to act.</p> <p><strong>So the bill's about internet adoptions?</strong><br> Not really. This bill is basically about adoptions happening in England and Wales. But the government has said it will act quickly to implement section 14 of the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999, which will make it a criminal offence to adopt a child's overseas if the adoptive parents haven't got clearance from approved agencies in the child's home country. There may be a couple of minor amendments during the bill's passage through parliament to tighten up some loopholes.</p> <p><strong>This intercountry law does what exactly?</strong><br> When fully ratified by all four parliaments, in England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, it will enable the UK to ratify the 1993 Hague convention on protection of children and co-operation in respect of intercountry adoption. This is essentially a framework of minimum standards to make sure adoption is in the best interests of the child and that no profit is made from the process. But today's adoption bill is really about domestic adoption.</p> <p><strong>So why the need for change on the home front?</strong><br> The last Adoption Act was in 1976 - although The Children Act 1989 included passages on adoption. Times have changed for children and families.</p> <p><strong>Estuary-accented TV Tweenies have replaced Daphne Oxenford's received pronunciation on Radio 4's Listen with Mother?</strong><br> There's rather more to it than that. Changing family structures and a social acceptance of lone parenthood have radically altered adoption. Until the late 1970s, social services departments would encourage single mothers to give up their children for adoption. Now, single women tend to keep their babies. Different social mores and the advent of the contraceptive Pill mean that there are far fewer healthy newborns up for adoption.</p> <p><strong>Who is up for adoption?</strong><br> The majority of the children available have been in care, which means they come from troubled or traumatic backgrounds. Many have special needs - such as learning difficulties, behavioural problems or disabilities - and some wait a long time to find the right adoptive parents. They tend to be older and may have siblings who need to be adopted with them. In short, they are much more difficult children to place successfully.</p> <p><strong>What difference can a new law make?</strong><br> Recruitment of suitable families is key. At present, there is no national register of children available for adoption, so if social services can't find suitable parents for a child in their own catchment area, it's hard to hunt elsewhere. The bill will outline plans for a computerised database of children waiting for adoption throughout England and Wales (Scotland may join the database at a later date.)</p> <p><strong>What else?</strong><br> Tony Blair made adoption his crusade last summer, when he headed a review. \"When children cannot live with their birth parents, for whatever reason, we all share a responsibility to make sure that they have a chance of a fresh start, and an opportunity to enjoy the kind of loving family life which most of us take for granted.\"</p> <p><strong>Did he praise motherhood and apple pie, too?</strong><br> Actually, he started to put the boot in just after that. Social workers weren't providing those happy families. \"In far too many parts of the system, there is a lack of clarity, of consistency and of fairness. Most pressingly, children in an already vulnerable position are being badly let down,\" he said. The prime minister said he was fed up with children languishing in care and was determined to speed up adoption. The bill underpins this approach, setting targets for each stage in the adoption process.</p> <p><strong>Are things bad and getting worse, then?</strong><br> Adoption experts certainly agree on the need for change - and social services directors would acknowledge that more needs to be done. However, the trend appears to be moving in the right direction. Rob Hutchinson, children's spokesman for the Association of Directors of Social Services, says: \"Social services departments have been making progress, not least because they have been given new resources by the government under the Quality Protects scheme. You can't just simply work on the basis of statistical figures - we can't push children into adoption to make up our figures - but generally more children are being adopted in local authorities.\" Last year, 2,700 children who were looked after by local authorities were adopted - representing half of all adoptions in England. This compares with 2,200 in 1999 and 1,900 in 1996. Of those 2,700, 420 were given up voluntarily and 1,100 were \"freed for adoption\".</p> <p><strong>Freed for adoption - what does that mean?</strong><br> It's a phrase used when parents and social workers come to a supposedly \"voluntary agreement\" and means that, when a case comes to court, an adoption order will be granted without contest. But some parents, faced with losing their children, feel they're put under pressure to make it easier for the children by \"freeing\" them. And they resent the way it's phrased on the social services form, which they feel suggests that they're willingly giving up their children.</p> <p><strong>What else is the bill promising?</strong><br> One of the significant elements will be the statutory post-adoption services on offer to adopting parents. At present, it's good practice, but rarely happens. Now, for the first time, adoptive parents will have a right to an assessment of their needs and to services meant to meet those needs.</p> <p><strong>Anything else I should know?</strong><br> Isn't that enough? Well, one last thing to remember - this new piece of legislation pretty much brings together domestic adoption law in one act.</p>",

So the bill's about internet adoptions? Not really. This bill is basically about adoptions happening in England and Wales. But the government has said it will act quickly to implement section 14 of the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999, which will make it a criminal offence to adopt a child's overseas if the adoptive parents haven't got clearance from approved agencies in the child's home country. There may be a couple of minor amendments during the bill's passage through parliament to tighten up some loopholes. This intercountry law does what exactly? When fully ratified by all four parliaments, in England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, it will enable the UK to ratify the 1993 Hague convention on protection of children and co-operation in respect of intercountry adoption. This is essentially a framework of minimum standards to make sure adoption is in the best interests of the child and that no profit is made from the process. But today's adoption bill is really about domestic adoption. So why the need for change on the home front? The last Adoption Act was in 1976 - although The Children Act 1989 included passages on adoption. Times have changed for children and families. Estuary-accented TV Tweenies have replaced Daphne Oxenford's received pronunciation on Radio 4's Listen with Mother? There's rather more to it than that. Changing family structures and a social acceptance of lone parenthood have radically altered adoption. Until the late 1970s, social services departments would encourage single mothers to give up their children for adoption. Now, single women tend to keep their babies. Different social mores and the advent of the contraceptive Pill mean that there are far fewer healthy newborns up for adoption. Who is up for adoption? The majority of the children available have been in care, which means they come from troubled or traumatic backgrounds. Many have special needs - such as learning difficulties, behavioural problems or disabilities - and some wait a long time to find the right adoptive parents. They tend to be older and may have siblings who need to be adopted with them. In short, they are much more difficult children to place successfully. What difference can a new law make? Recruitment of suitable families is key. At present, there is no national register of children available for adoption, so if social services can't find suitable parents for a child in their own catchment area, it's hard to hunt elsewhere. The bill will outline plans for a computerised database of children waiting for adoption throughout England and Wales (Scotland may join the database at a later date.) What else? Tony Blair made adoption his crusade last summer, when he headed a review. \"When children cannot live with their birth parents, for whatever reason, we all share a responsibility to make sure that they have a chance of a fresh start, and an opportunity to enjoy the kind of loving family life which most of us take for granted.\" Did he praise motherhood and apple pie, too? Actually, he started to put the boot in just after that. Social workers weren't providing those happy families. \"In far too many parts of the system, there is a lack of clarity, of consistency and of fairness. Most pressingly, children in an already vulnerable position are being badly let down,\" he said. The prime minister said he was fed up with children languishing in care and was determined to speed up adoption. The bill underpins this approach, setting targets for each stage in the adoption process. Are things bad and getting worse, then? Adoption experts certainly agree on the need for change - and social services directors would acknowledge that more needs to be done. However, the trend appears to be moving in the right direction. Rob Hutchinson, children's spokesman for the Association of Directors of Social Services, says: \"Social services departments have been making progress, not least because they have been given new resources by the government under the Quality Protects scheme. You can't just simply work on the basis of statistical figures - we can't push children into adoption to make up our figures - but generally more children are being adopted in local authorities.\" Last year, 2,700 children who were looked after by local authorities were adopted - representing half of all adoptions in England. This compares with 2,200 in 1999 and 1,900 in 1996. Of those 2,700, 420 were given up voluntarily and 1,100 were \"freed for adoption\". Freed for adoption - what does that mean? It's a phrase used when parents and social workers come to a supposedly \"voluntary agreement\" and means that, when a case comes to court, an adoption order will be granted without contest. But some parents, faced with losing their children, feel they're put under pressure to make it easier for the children by \"freeing\" them. And they resent the way it's phrased on the social services form, which they feel suggests that they're willingly giving up their children. What else is the bill promising? One of the significant elements will be the statutory post-adoption services on offer to adopting parents. At present, it's good practice, but rarely happens. Now, for the first time, adoptive parents will have a right to an assessment of their needs and to services meant to meet those needs. Anything else I should know? Isn't that enough? Well, one last thing to remember - this new piece of legislation pretty much brings together domestic adoption law in one act.",

Cynical about all politicians, we surely couldn't care less about the timing of their little games. Why would people trouble themselves with the finer points of a mechanistic question, requiring engagement with a class of person whose performance in the game makes no difference to them anyway? Isn't the choice Tony Blair soon has to make a very minor matter?</p> <p>Call me a romantic, but I have to resist this, even though, when I did so a fortnight ago and proposed a postponement from May 3, I was dumped on by important people for credulous naivety. The hideous influx of foot and mouth disease has exposed a divide which is not between north and south, or rich and poor, or old and young, or numerate and illiterate, or friends of Blair and friends of Brown, or even between the city and the country. The divide is between two Britains, and two moods, and it becomes clearer day by day.</p> <p>The first mood infiltrates the entire administration, the entire Labour party, and almost the entire band of Labour's hangers-on. It is stern and purposeful. The election is a piece of machinery, an essential cog in the apparatus of government, calibrated and primed for active duty on May 3 2001 ever since the date, four years ago, when democracy last did the business for Mr Blair.</p> <p>This mood is much influenced by the diligence with which the given date has been prepared for. It is lost in wonder at the fineness of the budget, grovels before the timing of pension rises and other handouts, all of them made possible by the strategic foresight that led to an economic miracle reaching the apogee of its perceived brilliance at precisely the moment required. The hoardings are bought, the broadcasts planned, the party war-rooms readied for action down to the last on-line work-station allocated and mapped exclusively in the Guardian.</p> <p>The mood regards itself as doing a job of work. All this diligence is for the good of the country. For the country needs another Labour government to continue the start that's been made, and if stealing a year off the five-year mandate is the way to maximise the outcome, the duty of the prime minister is clear. Plainly he must do it quickly. His recent visits to marginal constituencies north, south, east and west cannot be allowed to go to waste. How cretinous to imagine otherwise! For this is the plan, and the plan must be kept to, in the national interest.</p> <p>Moreover, the public are apparently insisting that it should be. Asked if they want to vote now, more than 60% register the opinion that they wouldn't say no. An election by public demand! Besides, only 5% of voters live in areas affected by foot and mouth. Does anyone suggest the other 95% should be denied their rights to suit the convenience of this suffering, but ultimately insignificant, minority? Why should the majority be disappointed? The very fact that the election has been timetabled for the last four years becomes a reason for abruptly concluding it, come what may.</p> <p>Such is the mood of the professionals. It's not untouched by a secret cynicism. The parties duly out-cynic each other. Labour privately reckons the 5% in question are mostly in Tory areas any way. For their part the Tories pretend that the last thing they want is any delaying of the moment when they have the Blair cabinet gagging on the ground, the electorate's boot across its windpipe. But the key to the mood is its stony-eyed indifference to the broader view, its denial that any kind of crisis might exceed in importance the crisis of seeing the computerised coordinates of an electoral plan disturbed.</p> <p>There is a second Britain, and an alternative mood. In normal times it might accept some of the arguments of the professionals. The four-year term, after all, has become commonplace. Voters are used to the self- interested calculations of prime ministers. Each day now, though, the gulf gets wider between the thinking of the government and the feeling, the temper, the unarticulated sensibility of a public which, I believe, stretches well beyond the quietly disposable 5%.</p> <p>It's a question of propriety and priorities. Even voters a hundred miles from the nearest bovine funeral pyre become aware that something is wrong. To insist on conducting an unnecessary election while the fires are raging and unburied cadavers stink, far from asserting the timeless importance of democracy, will show the frivolity with which the present incumbents regard it. A country alerted by television to the sombre mood this calamity deserves to summon up will find itself forced into a procedure which, just now, does not seem overwhelmingly important.</p> <p>It's airily said that electoral procedure has changed. Nobody needs to move around any more, either to canvass or to vote. The mobile phone and the postal ballot are the disinfectants of virtual democracy. All true, for those who can arrange it. But all an apologia that comes from the professional's playbook, not from the experience that an election is supposed to be.</p> <p>My guess is that the first mood is going to win this contest. Its exponents are extraordinarily unyielding. They're the more focused, the more organised, and one man's imperial thumb, up or down, is enough to give the signal. Unless the next 10 days produce an upsurge of foot and mouth that even he cannot claim is under control, the four-year critical path will reach its predestined end.</p> <p>But two consequences can already be predicted with certainty. First, it will be a sour election. It was never likely to repeat the exultancy of 1997. It will now descend further into joylessness. In their guts, voters far beyond the county farmlands will feel it ought not to be happening. For all their preparations, the government will find the campaign hard to conduct. Unless foot and mouth is declared to be old news, or television is bludgeoned into adopting a new agenda, the paralysis of the countryside is likely to be displayed nightly alongside the affectations of imminent triumph over every problem, which is the message election campaigns are exclusively designed to convey. The contradiction will be jarring.</p> <p>It seems unlikely, second, to do Labour any favours. An election called as the culmination of an exercise in well-managed opportunism will have the opposite effect. Labour won't lose, whatever the date. But Labour will seem ruthless, and an agent of the very cynicism Mr Blair once looked as though he seriously intended to dispel. A foot and mouth election will lose votes, not win them, for the people who inflict it on us in their larger plan to take over the 21st century. Or else we will forgive them even this, and plod, untroubled, on our downward path to the incinerator of democratic virtue.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\"> hugoyoung@compuserve.com <br> <b>What's going on?</b><br></a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

      "body": "<p>Say what you will about MI5, it is deadly serious about opening itself up, and such is its craving for transparency that today at the Royal United Services Institute, a Whitehall-based think-tank, a big conference is being held on overseeing the security and intelligence services. For the first time, the MI5 chief, Sir Stephen Lander, will make a speech in public, and rightly much has been made of the fact that anyone can attend: all those interested, including the comedian Mark Thomas, were invited to apply until the hall was full. It is true that a couple of people were refused tickets. A certain David Shayler and his girlfriend Annie Machon, another ex-MI5 officer, were told they were blacklisted by the RUSI which perplexingly said only members and guests could attend, but that must have been a cock up. After all, the only other explanation - the deliberate exclusion of the only two people apart from Sir Stephen with inside knowledge of MI5 and serious points to make - would render the conference a time-wasting sham.</p> <p><br><br>\u0095 Don't be bamboozled, however, into thinking that military intelligence is the preserve of the security services. The government shows plenty of brains as well in this field, not least when considering using army snipers to take out possibly infected livestock. It's a brilliant idea, albeit not quite as original as it might appear. In what must be regarded as a classic case of life initiating art, the inspiration for the brainwave was, as many of you will have guessed, Carry On Up The Khyber. The connoisseur's choice as the finest of its genre, this 1968 masterpiece features Her Majesty's Third Foot and Mouth regiment under the command of Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond (Sid James).</p> <p><br><br>\u0095 Thinking ahead to the army's involvement, meanwhile, my colleague Marina Hyde is minded to call the Ministry of Defence with an enquiry. Could we know which medals will be up for grabs, she asks Paul Sykes in the press office, should army snipers be called upon to enter the foot and mouth fray? \"I don't think we'd be in that position,\" he replies. \"I don't think we'd be talking about military decorations in such an event. Goodbye.\" Poor show.</p> <p><br><br>\u0095 Everything I said yesterday would appear today will now appear tomorrow. If there's room.</p> <p><br><br>\u0095 I was sad to miss my old friend Jonathan Aitken at the opening of a very stylish production of The Servant at the Lyric in Hammersmith on Tuesday night, and guess that religious studies in Oxford kept him from seeing his nephew Jack Davenport reprise the part of \"Mr Tony\" played by Dirk Bogarde in the film.

      "bodyText": "Say what you will about MI5, it is deadly serious about opening itself up, and such is its craving for transparency that today at the Royal United Services Institute, a Whitehall-based think-tank, a big conference is being held on overseeing the security and intelligence services. For the first time, the MI5 chief, Sir Stephen Lander, will make a speech in public, and rightly much has been made of the fact that anyone can attend: all those interested, including the comedian Mark Thomas, were invited to apply until the hall was full. It is true that a couple of people were refused tickets. A certain David Shayler and his girlfriend Annie Machon, another ex-MI5 officer, were told they were blacklisted by the RUSI which perplexingly said only members and guests could attend, but that must have been a cock up. After all, the only other explanation - the deliberate exclusion of the only two people apart from Sir Stephen with inside knowledge of MI5 and serious points to make - would render the conference a time-wasting sham. \u0095 Don't be bamboozled, however, into thinking that military intelligence is the preserve of the security services. The government shows plenty of brains as well in this field, not least when considering using army snipers to take out possibly infected livestock. It's a brilliant idea, albeit not quite as original as it might appear. In what must be regarded as a classic case of life initiating art, the inspiration for the brainwave was, as many of you will have guessed, Carry On Up The Khyber. The connoisseur's choice as the finest of its genre, this 1968 masterpiece features Her Majesty's Third Foot and Mouth regiment under the command of Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond (Sid James). \u0095 Thinking ahead to the army's involvement, meanwhile, my colleague Marina Hyde is minded to call the Ministry of Defence with an enquiry. Could we know which medals will be up for grabs, she asks Paul Sykes in the press office, should army snipers be called upon to enter the foot and mouth fray? \"I don't think we'd be in that position,\" he replies. \"I don't think we'd be talking about military decorations in such an event. Goodbye.\" Poor show. \u0095 Everything I said yesterday would appear today will now appear tomorrow. If there's room. \u0095 I was sad to miss my old friend Jonathan Aitken at the opening of a very stylish production of The Servant at the Lyric in Hammersmith on Tuesday night, and guess that religious studies in Oxford kept him from seeing his nephew Jack Davenport reprise the part of \"Mr Tony\" played by Dirk Bogarde in the film. Then again, since in his book he credits an item here, about a sermon he gave in a church close to the theatre, with persuading him to resign, perhaps the area holds painful memories. Whatever, he missed a bit of a treat - although whether members of the butlers' school which has taken a large block booking will see it that way is unclear. Still, if they choose to view Robin Maugham's play as a teaching aid, and not an unusually dark study of homosexual power plays, that's their business. \u0095 Good to see Nasty Nick writing in G2 yesterday, and how acute he was in pinpointing all the privileges given to Big Brother's celebrity housemates that were denied him and his colleagues. \"There were,\" he says of the mollycoddled incumbents, \"radiators all over the house\" - but none when he was involved.

      "body": "<p>Online comedy has come a long way in the past year. Only last summer C4's abysmal Dotcomedy series could find nothing more amusing than a stream of sexual perversions and a simpering Gail Porter, one of the reasons it was unceremoniously axed at the end of the first series. Now, however, comedy is alive and kicking hard - providing a foothold to many a struggling writer and offering unlikely hope to internet content providers looking for instant stickiness. </p> <p>Stickiness is already the big buzzword of 2001, as websites struggle to find content which will see users returning again and again, thereby seeing more of their precious banner advertising. Traditionally, the ultimate in sticky content has been porn and competitions, with news trailing in a poor third and comedy almost nowhere to be seen. </p> <p>\"Comedy can be very sticky, if properly executed\" says Mike Ragsdale, one of the three founder members of Hecklers.com, the US site launched in 1995 which now boasts 400,000 unique visitors per month and a claimed advertising click through of 3%, when the industry average is 0.5%. Interestingly, Hecklers not only applauds this loyalty but relies upon it. \"While some comedians have to hope that their writers can come up with a few good laughs here and there, all we have to do is hope that of the 5,000 emails we receive and review every day, that a handful of them contain an hilarious joke that would have otherwise gone untold, and unrecorded.\" </p> <p>In the past, bandwidth restrictions ensured online comedy catered for the lowest common denominator, with the likes of <a href=\"http://www.jokeindex.com\">www.jokeindex.com</a> quickly replacing the old Xerox funnies which used to be stuck to company notice-boards, if not gaining a reputation for originality. This too is changing, as improved download times make both animation and video a feasible part of comedy output. </p> <p>\"The problem with internet comedy_\" explains Charlie Brooker, co-founder of the UK comedy collective Zeppotron, \"is that the user is sitting in an uncomfortable chair with one hand on the mouse and there's a million things they would rather be doing. You have to keep things short. Five minutes is too long, two minutes is about our maximum.\" </p> <p>Zeppotron was founded at the end of last year from the writing core of the 11-o'clock show and is best known for the Radio Times spoof TV Go Home and the animated series Office Romance. The TV Go Home page alone boasts 40,000 unique visitors a month with an average visit lasting 14 minutes - highly sticky by anyone's standards. Using this brand-based approach has already worked in mainstream broadcasting for decades. Indeed, the company is 25% owned by Endemol, responsible for TV hits such as Big Brother and Ready Steady Cook - all simple formulae, relentlessly hammered home. </p> <p>\"You do have to be fairly unsubtle,\" says Brooker. \"You have to convince people quickly that's it's a good thing to hang around, which lends itself to sledgehammer tactics. The problem with instant publishing is that writers tend to get carried away and not edit themselves.\" </p> <p>However, there is a worry that comedy could go the same way as porn, with users gravitating towards harder material which would be shunned by mainstream broadcasters. Popular spoof-site The Onion may be consistently funny but veers perilously closer to slander. It boasts a steady million visits per week. </p> <p>\"It's really hard to imagine online comedy becoming more radical, if you're talking about the subject matter.\" concludes Ragsdale. \"I mean, at this point online, is there anything we haven't already seen, in terms of sexuality or violence or taboos? </p> <p>\"Advertisers simply aren't comfortable supporting \"Rated-X\" and even \"Rated-R\" humour. Believe me, we've tried. And without advertisers or some major corporate backing, it's hard to imagine how a large comedy media company could ever evolve.\" </p> <p>All of which puts comedy back where it started, coming to terms with new technology but wrestling with its conscience as to how far to push it. As many a struggling comic has already discovered, being radical is all well and good -but it rarely pays the bills. </p> <p><strong> The web's idea of funny</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com\">www.theonion.com</a></p> <p> An accurate pastiche of both Yahoo and CNN, the Onion maintains a hectic stream of very amusing spoofs. While the site is primarily US-oriented, headlines such as \"Sociologist Considers Own Behavior Indicative Of Larger Trends\" has to be worth further consideration. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.e4.com\">www.e4.com</a> </p> <p>C4's new digital channel has already managed some pioneering comedy such as the excellent Banzai, and its new website delves into original online material too. Unfortunately, the site is unnecessarily Flash-heavy, making it hard to navigate for those using slower PCs. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hecklers.com\">www.hecklers.com</a></p> <p> Inventive American slander, broken into bite sized chunks. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.disappointment.com\">www.disappointment.com</a><br> Like most comedy, this quirky, low-budget shrine to tasteless observation divides those who comes across it. The Net recently voted it one of the 5 un-funniest on the web; the author's own girlfriend, described as \"crushingly dull and looks like a pig\" would be likely to agree. Others, however, think it's hilarious. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.zeppotron.com\">www.zeppotron.com</a></p> <p> The Zeppotron site focuses on their three best-known comedy brands, TV Go Home, Office Romance and Unnovations. All very funny, for those not easily offended, and much of the content is fast approaching the best standards of TV comedy.</p>",

Indeed, the company is 25% owned by Endemol, responsible for TV hits such as Big Brother and Ready Steady Cook - all simple formulae, relentlessly hammered home. \"You do have to be fairly unsubtle,\" says Brooker. \"You have to convince people quickly that's it's a good thing to hang around, which lends itself to sledgehammer tactics. The problem with instant publishing is that writers tend to get carried away and not edit themselves.\" However, there is a worry that comedy could go the same way as porn, with users gravitating towards harder material which would be shunned by mainstream broadcasters. Popular spoof-site The Onion may be consistently funny but veers perilously closer to slander. It boasts a steady million visits per week. \"It's really hard to imagine online comedy becoming more radical, if you're talking about the subject matter.\" concludes Ragsdale. \"I mean, at this point online, is there anything we haven't already seen, in terms of sexuality or violence or taboos? \"Advertisers simply aren't comfortable supporting \"Rated-X\" and even \"Rated-R\" humour. Believe me, we've tried. And without advertisers or some major corporate backing, it's hard to imagine how a large comedy media company could ever evolve.\" All of which puts comedy back where it started, coming to terms with new technology but wrestling with its conscience as to how far to push it. As many a struggling comic has already discovered, being radical is all well and good -but it rarely pays the bills. The web's idea of funny www.theonion.com An accurate pastiche of both Yahoo and CNN, the Onion maintains a hectic stream of very amusing spoofs. While the site is primarily US-oriented, headlines such as \"Sociologist Considers Own Behavior Indicative Of Larger Trends\" has to be worth further consideration. www.e4.com C4's new digital channel has already managed some pioneering comedy such as the excellent Banzai, and its new website delves into original online material too. Unfortunately, the site is unnecessarily Flash-heavy, making it hard to navigate for those using slower PCs. www.hecklers.com Inventive American slander, broken into bite sized chunks. www.disappointment.com Like most comedy, this quirky, low-budget shrine to tasteless observation divides those who comes across it. The Net recently voted it one of the 5 un-funniest on the web; the author's own girlfriend, described as \"crushingly dull and looks like a pig\" would be likely to agree. Others, however, think it's hilarious. www.zeppotron.com The Zeppotron site focuses on their three best-known comedy brands, TV Go Home, Office Romance and Unnovations. All very funny, for those not easily offended, and much of the content is fast approaching the best standards of TV comedy.",

      "body": "<p>How the mighty have fallen. Little more than year ago, Jeff Bezos was flying high. The price of <a href=\"http://www.Amazon.com\" target=\"_new\">Amazon.com</a> shares was in the stratosphere and the company's beaming 38-year-old chief executive was being lionised as Time magazine's Man of the Year. Supported by the enthusiam of fawning Wall Street analysts, Bezos - like much of the internet world - could walk on water. But no longer: As the internet economy has collapsed, not even the golden calves of IT are immune to the sour mood of the market. </p> <p>And no one is more out of favour than the Wall Street analysts on whose every pronouncement - \"buy\", \"sell\", \"hold\" - investors once took as gospel. As the Nasdaq dipped below 2,000 this week, more than 3,000 points off its peak of 5,049 just one year ago, the analysts who promoted the tech boom are now being held responsible for the billions lost by investors, many of them individuals seduced into the markets by the lure of easy money. </p> <p>Call it the blame game: the press blames the analysts, the dot.comers blame the venture capitalists, the venture capitalists blame the markets and almost everyone blames the media. But it is the cheer-leaders of the new economy - analysts - who are taking the heat for the collapse of technology stocks. \"The Age of the Analyst is dead,\" proclaims this week's New Yorker. \"In the last five months the clued-in analyst has been exposed as clueless and the equity-analysis game has proved to be something of a sham.\" </p> <p>A year ago, Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker was basking in adulation. She had been dubbed Queen of the Net by supporting Amazon. She had been subject of a glowing profile in the New Yorker in 1999, named the third most powerful woman in business by Fortune (and put on the cover) in the same year and invited to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Meeker became the highest paid woman on Wall Street with a reported base salary of $15 million a year. </p> <p>Then there was Merrill Lynch's Henry Blodget, Wall Street's loudest cheerleader for internet stocks. Named King Henry by the Wall Street Journal, the red-haired Blodget was an obscure stock picker before he predicted in December 1998 that Amazon, then trading at $240, could hit $400 a share within a year, pushing the stock up 20% in a day. That made him the media's favourite internet talking head. </p> <p>From the day he burst into the headlines in 1998, Blodget has been mentioned 95 times in the Wall Street Journal, 66 times in the New York Times, 53 times in The Washington Post (which ran a huge profile of him last year) and 27 times in Business Week. Since the beginning of last year, he has been mentioned (or interviewed) on television 816 times. </p> <p>Then the internet bubble burst. Meeker's stock picks - Ask Jeeves, Drugstore.com, Priceline.com, Women.com - have fallen by as much as 96%. Blodget's top recommendations have plunged 79% - including eToys and Pets.com, both of which have shut down. </p> <p>The pair are rarely on television now. Meeker hasn't been on CNBC since October. The New York Times says Blodget and others like him need to go \"a long way toward explaining why the market for technology stocks has crashed,\" despite the fact that, like many, they have now changed their tune. </p> <p>But the story of how Meeker, Blodget and others encouraged investors to bid stocks up to levels they now admit were unjustifiable goes a long way toward explaining why the market for technology stocks has since crashed. </p> <p>Looking back a year after the peak, it is clear that prices hit astronomical levels in part because of a euphoria infecting not just day traders but giants like Merrill Lynch. \"When someone appears to be right, they become larger than life,\" says Peter Bernstein, a veteran consultant to big money managers. </p> <p>As the Nasdaq soared, it was considered imprudent to get too particular about business models, let alone poke around at individual valuations. After all, Amazon's stock, like so many internet stocks, relied on the dreams of small investors fed by upbeat TV sound bites from Blodget, Meeker and the rest. And Amazon, perhaps more than any other firm, had a lot to thank the analysts for - and a lot to lose if the sentiment reversed. </p> <p>Take Amazon: within weeks of its initial public share offering in May 1997, the company was trading below the offering price and Wall Street wags had nicknamed it Amazon.bomb. But by the time Meeker started promoting it three months later, the internet was becoming a mass phenomenon, not just a gathering place for geeks. Amazon, Meeker wrote, \"is the leading retailer/ merchandiser on the 'net.\" </p> <p>\"The great paradox of the analyst's reign was that, as their stature grew, the quality of their analysis plummeted,\" noted the New Yorker. \"With few exceptions, analysts did not see trouble coming and didn't warn their investors to get out of the way.\" </p> <p> For her part, Meeker says she was always worried about becoming a posterchild for dot.com mania. \"I did not aspire to be a media celebrity in any way, shape or form,\" she says. \"I felt uncomfortable being in the limelight.\" Blodget, too, has taken a fall. \"Things change,\" he said last week. \"The market went from saying, 'We like companies that are growing quickly but are losing a lot of money' to saying, 'We want to see earnings.' It's very hard to predict a 180-degree turn like that.\" </p> <p>But some heroes have emerged. Although seen as a heretic when other analysts were still feeding investor euphoria, a 29-year-old Lehman Bros analyst named Ravi Suria issued a scorching report in February saying Amazon would run out of money this year. </p> <p>Suria had already set himself up as Bezos's nemesis-in-chief. Last June, the then-little-known analyst sounded the first warning, arguing that Amazon was showing the \"financial characteristics that have driven innumerable retailers to disaster throughout history\". His analysis created a sensation. </p> <p>The company called it \"hogwash\", and chief executive Jeff Bezos personally disputed the conclusions. Investors, however, voted with their wallets, sending the shares down nearly 20% in a day. At that time, Amazon stock was trading at around $45, and has fallen ever since. </p> <p>In theory, the report should have made Suria's career. After all, Meeker and Blodget had become Wall Street and media darlings after writing about Amazon. But they, of course, were on the side of the vast e-commerce company which sells about 11% of all goods sold online and which - along with the auction house eBay - is probably the dot.com most beloved by its customers. But unlike eBay, the strength of Amazon's balance sheet is constantly in dispute. </p> <p>For Suria, who likes to smoke cigars and skydive, and lists an interest in imported bottled beer, taking on ever-sunny Bezos meant taking on the whole internet economy. </p> <p>Already irked by Suria's warning last June, the subsequent report on Febuary 5 started a war. \"Obviously, you can't take this seriously,\" Amazon spokesman Bill Curry said. \"It's a silly report that's chock full of errors.\" </p> <p>According to the New York Observer, Amazon went to considerable lengths to quash Suria's predictions. When Amazon executives learned of the report's harsh nature - that the spectre of bankruptcy was being raised - they leapt to the phones. They held up publication for 10 days, it is claimed. </p> <p>Whether Suria's predictions prove right or wrong (in the aftermath of his report, half a dozen Wall Street analysts have downgraded Amazon shares, some even saying the company may still be overvalued) he may have changed the nature of the tech analysts' trade. </p> <p>\"Whether or not the Lehman analyst is right to take a bearish stance on Amazon.com, give him credit for taking a much-needed skeptical (sic) stand,\" said TheStreet.com. </p> <p>Of course, Bezos strongly denies Amazon is in trouble. But the company has been getting bad press for plans to make severance packages for some 1,300 employees laid off last month, conditional on their continued silence with a \"non-disparagement\" clause. </p> <p>And, earlier this month, Bezos completed his third sale of small portions of his Amazon holdings, which total more than $1 billion at current market prices. </p> <p>In late 1998, Bezos's sales brought him about $23m. Last May it was $20m. This month it was $12m. </p> <p>And, in the wake of this latest report, even Blodget has downplayed expectations for the firm by saying: \"still comfortable, but on alert\". </p> <p>Suria is confident that he will be vindicated after months of having his credibility questioned; Bezos is adamant he will not. \"The company has never been in better shape,\" he said recently. </p> <p>The same cannot be said of the analysts' trade.</p>",

If press reports of email and internet monitoring at work are anything to go by you're not alone. But is the coverage of employer monitoring of email and internet use based on fact? </p> <p>There is scant evidence that employers spend a great deal of effort spying on their staff, and that employees feel that their privacy is violated in this way. If employers are keeping an unnecessarily watchful eye on employees then they are simply poor managers, who will ultimately damage relationships with staff, and consequently their business. </p> <p>Despite the hype, there are very good business reasons for employers not to engage in large scale surveillance activities. The huge level of resources that would be required to do so for one. Large organisations would need teams of people to read emails and check every website visited in today's technology-driven workplace. Even if wrong-doing was detected, it would be unlikely to warrant such expense. </p> <p>Employers are, however, concerned to protect employees and themselves from inappropriate emails or internet use by individual workers. Many organisations use software to scan emails and web sites visited for particular words that could indicate abuse of the company's system. And some industry sectors such as finance monitor staff more closely to protect against fraud. As customers, we would not want it any other way. </p> <p>Indeed most reasonable employees would accept that some monitoring of their performance and behaviour is required. Legally, they are entitled to have their personal information treated in confidence by their employer. Employees should also generally be aware of when and how their work will be monitored. Covert surveillance of employees can only ever be justified in limited circumstances, such as the detection of criminal activity. </p> <p>For their part, employers have legal obligations to employees, customers and shareholders that require them to conduct some monitoring of staff. Fraud, the downloading of illegal software and time wasting on entertainment sites are just some of the uses of the internet by employees that businesses need to prohibit. </p> <p>Employers also need to protect their reputation, which may be harmed by inappropriate emails from the organisation's system. At the start of the year, Royal &amp; SunAlliance suspended 80 employees following a complaint by a member of the public about lewd images sent by email. These have been described by the company as offensive and \"of a highly graphic nature\". Investigations have so far led to 11 dismissals and resignations by seven people. </p> <p>Employers can also be held liable for employees' actions. Following defamatory emails sent by one of its staff, Norwich Union was obliged to pay Western Provident Association \u00a3450,000 in costs and damages. Similarly, inappro priate emails can constitute sexual harassment. If the employer did nothing to prevent the mischief, they could be held responsible. </p> <p>Despite the existing legal obligations and responsibilities it is clear that there is confusion about what employers should or can do to monitor staff use of email and the internet. The situation needs clarifying. Unfortunately, the position will not be helped by recent proposals from the UK's Information Commissioner, who is responsible for promoting and monitoring good use of personal information. </p> <p>The Commissioner's public consultation exercise on a draft code of practice on the use of personal data in employer/employee relationships ended earlier this year. </p> <p>If issued as presently written, the code would place considerable restrictions on the monitoring of employees' emails and their use of the internet. The purpose of the code - to provide guidance to employers on how to protect employees' personal data - is welcome. However, rather than establishing basic principles that are readily understood by employers and employees, the code is overly prescriptive, with 44 'standards' proposed that organisations would have to follow. </p> <p>Given the restrictions on their operations and bureaucratic burden these would impose, there is a risk that the code will encourage employers to ban workers from using email and the net for personal use, currently allowed by many organisations. As the code covers workers' personal information, employers could regard this as a way of protecting themselves from legal claims by employees. This means that employers would be unable to take as reasonable an approach as they might otherwise like. </p> <p>The problem with the draft code is that it fails to take account of the array of circumstances in which it would have to be applied. What is important for the relationship between employee and employer is that monitoring of staff is conducted at a level appropriate to the business, in a way that is fair, and seen to be fair. </p> <p>Good employers achieve this by developing organisational policies, with employees' input, that spell out what is reasonable for their particular organisation. In this way, everyone knows where they stand, and why. The mutual trust that this inspires is the basis for a healthy relationship between employee and employer. This would certainly not be achieved by employers engaging in Orwellian \"snooping\" tactics. </p> <p> \u0095 Diane Sinclair is a policy adviser to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development</p>",

Unfortunately, the position will not be helped by recent proposals from the UK's Information Commissioner, who is responsible for promoting and monitoring good use of personal information. The Commissioner's public consultation exercise on a draft code of practice on the use of personal data in employer/employee relationships ended earlier this year. If issued as presently written, the code would place considerable restrictions on the monitoring of employees' emails and their use of the internet. The purpose of the code - to provide guidance to employers on how to protect employees' personal data - is welcome. However, rather than establishing basic principles that are readily understood by employers and employees, the code is overly prescriptive, with 44 'standards' proposed that organisations would have to follow. Given the restrictions on their operations and bureaucratic burden these would impose, there is a risk that the code will encourage employers to ban workers from using email and the net for personal use, currently allowed by many organisations. As the code covers workers' personal information, employers could regard this as a way of protecting themselves from legal claims by employees. This means that employers would be unable to take as reasonable an approach as they might otherwise like. The problem with the draft code is that it fails to take account of the array of circumstances in which it would have to be applied. What is important for the relationship between employee and employer is that monitoring of staff is conducted at a level appropriate to the business, in a way that is fair, and seen to be fair. Good employers achieve this by developing organisational policies, with employees' input, that spell out what is reasonable for their particular organisation. In this way, everyone knows where they stand, and why. The mutual trust that this inspires is the basis for a healthy relationship between employee and employer. This would certainly not be achieved by employers engaging in Orwellian \"snooping\" tactics. \u0095 Diane Sinclair is a policy adviser to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development",

And today, you don't even need to own a computer. Web-based mail services let you send email from an office computer or a cybercafe. The main disadvantage is that you usually have to be online to use them. </p> <p>Web-based email accounts, such as <a href=\"http://www.hotmail.com\">Hotmail</a>, are easy to use, and free. It is therefore worth having one as a back-up when other services are not working properly. You can even set up \"junk accounts\" to give to websites that require registration, and to people you don't trust. </p> <p>However, they do not provide anonymity. Even if you sign up under a false name, the service is probably logging your IP (Internet Protocol) address, which can be used to trace you. </p> <p>All web-based mail services are much the same. Hotmail is the most popular and has the advantage that you can also collect mail using Outlook Express 5. However, I recommend Yahoo's email service (http://mail. yahoo.com) for two reasons. First, it provides six megabytes of storage, which should be enough to hold 500-600 email messages. Second, you can use Yahoo mail even with JavaScript and other advanced browser features blocked - athough you do have to allow \"cookies\" (small text files stored on your hard drive). </p> <p>Even if you do not object to scripting, you may sometimes want to collect mail from a handheld computer, network terminal or other device that does not have all the facilities of a personal computer. </p> <p>In Internet Explorer 5, the settings to control Active Scripting, Java and ActiveX programs, and cookies are in the security section. Go to the Tools menu, and select Internet Options. When the tabbed dialog box appears, click on Security, then on the button at the bottom, marked Custom Level. This will reveal a set of options with radio buttons that let you select Disable, Enable or Prompt. </p> <p>The Prompt option means the browser will ask whether or not to allow a particular feature to run on a page-by-page basis. Prompt is fine in theory but tedious in practice. Most commercial sites now use scripting and huge numbers use ActiveX. </p> <p>Whichever web-based mail service you choose, it should at least offer folders and an addressbook. Folders work like directories. You can use them to file away mail that you don't want to delete, but still don't want to see every day. </p> <p>Hotmail and Yahoo provide folders to store incoming and outgoing mail, draft mail, bulk mail and trash. Draft is used for letters you have started writing but are not ready to send. Bulk mail is used for junk mail or \"spam\": if the system thinks it sees unwanted commercial email, it will put it in the Bulk Mail folder instead of your Inbox. The Trash folder is used to store deleted email in case you have second thoughts and want it back. Click on the Empty button, however, and it has gone forever. </p> <p>It is easy to create new folders by typing in a name and clicking the Create Folder button. You can use them to store emails from specific people or about chosen topics. You can even have incoming mail diverted into these folders by setting up \"filters\" or \"rules\". To try this in Yahoo, click the Options entry on the left, then click on Filters. Both services also allow you to block mail from specified email addresses. </p> <p>It is also important to be able to store email addresses: you can't possibly remember them all. To do this in Yahoo, while reading mail, click the Add Addresses button on the right-hand side and fill in the form. Click on Add More Detail to enter phone numbers, nicknames, birthdates and so on. To enter names in Hotmail's much less powerful addressbook, click Save Address, at the end of the From: line. </p> <p>I have almost 1,000 addresses on Yahoo because I synchronise it with Microsoft Outlook on my desktop PC and with my handheld computer. However, some addressbook features require JavaScript. </p> <p>Web-based email services are much more sophisticated that they used to be, and most have features that few people know about or use. In Yahoo and Hotmail, for example, you can sort mail by date (ascending or descending), sender, subject, or size, just by clicking the labels at the top of the columns. </p> <p>Yahoo can also collect standard (POP) mail from three other accounts, and Hotmail from four. Finally, under Options, both let you set a different Reply-To address, such as a home or office mailbox. </p> <p>But if you use web-based email, you must keep an eye on it. The world is full of extremely inconsiderate people who send out attachments that take up 500K or more space. A couple of those can easily fill up a mailbox. After that, any further mail will be \"bounced\" - returned to the sender. </p> <p>Clear out your mailbox at least once a week or you could miss important mail, and upset the people trying to send it to you. </p>",

It will transform the Handspring from a personal information manager to a web-browsing smart phone. But at around \u00a3300 will there be many takers? </p> <p>Colligan has the bigger picture in mind. \"I think we'll look back on these early models in the same way that people remember the first Apple computers. Within a few years 80% of all handheld sales will be models permanently connected to the web using packet technology.\" </p> <p>He is adamant that Handspring won't be intimidated. \"The phone manufacturers' expertise is in voice communication. We are experts in data communication and that's the way the market is moving. Software is another area that will become vital and, again, it's an area we excel in.\" </p> <p>The first shots in the smart phone battle could be fired in the UK. \"The American mobile phone infrastructure is a mess, with no consistency in terms of coverage,\" he explains. \"The situation is different in the UK. I think you may find that communication products are released here in the UK first and then in the USA.\" </p> <p>Ultimately, Colligan knows that Handspring is about to move into a huge market. \"The mobile phone market is so large that to take even a small piece of that business would be a massive win.\" </p> <p>Colligan is in the UK to promote the launch of the latest in the Handspring handheld PC family, the Visor Edge. This model takes Colligan's old company Palm on at its own game, in that it is ultra thin and is finished in an attractive metal casing. Yet the Edge still features the Visor trademark in the Springboard slot - the place where users can slip small modules that add MP3, digital camera, GPS functionality and so on. </p> <p>The Edge has two other trump cards. It uses the DragonBall VZ 3MHz processor, making it the fastest moving Palm operating system device on the market. It also has excellent battery life with the lithium ion batteries running for a claimed 40 hours before needing recharging. </p> <p>With Palm beginning to work on accessories for its PDAs, and Handspring now parading a Palm V-style model, it appears that the two ranges are moving closer. </p> <p>Colligan doesn't see it that way. \"We've had this Visor ready to go for sometime, but decided we wanted to get a colour Handspring (the Prism) to the market first. A lot of the ideas we are working on are totally different to Palm.\" </p> <p>He expresses cynicism about the e-wallet project (in which your PDA stores credit card details and beams them to special terminals to pay for items), which Palm announced in January. </p> <p>January also saw the first public demonstration of a voice control system for the Microsoft Pocket PC PDA platform. But Handspring won't be following on Bill Gate's coat-tails. </p> <p>\"I've seen impressive voice command demos for 10 years, and I'm still not convinced it will work with a PDA.\" </p> <p>He also feels that Bluetooth could be a \"potential red herring\". \"Sure, people will use it to connect phones to their organisers, but as for location-based services where shops send you messages when you walk buy - that's just a pipe dream. </p> <p>\"When we worked on the Palm, we knew we were on to something big. It was just that for a while we were the only people who believed we could pull it off.\" </p> <p>There's a similar cynicism about the migration from PDAs to connected devices now. Maybe in 10 years' time, Colligan will be saying something similar about Handspring, too.</p>",

I think you may find that communication products are released here in the UK first and then in the USA.\" Ultimately, Colligan knows that Handspring is about to move into a huge market. \"The mobile phone market is so large that to take even a small piece of that business would be a massive win.\" Colligan is in the UK to promote the launch of the latest in the Handspring handheld PC family, the Visor Edge. This model takes Colligan's old company Palm on at its own game, in that it is ultra thin and is finished in an attractive metal casing. Yet the Edge still features the Visor trademark in the Springboard slot - the place where users can slip small modules that add MP3, digital camera, GPS functionality and so on. The Edge has two other trump cards. It uses the DragonBall VZ 3MHz processor, making it the fastest moving Palm operating system device on the market. It also has excellent battery life with the lithium ion batteries running for a claimed 40 hours before needing recharging. With Palm beginning to work on accessories for its PDAs, and Handspring now parading a Palm V-style model, it appears that the two ranges are moving closer. Colligan doesn't see it that way. \"We've had this Visor ready to go for sometime, but decided we wanted to get a colour Handspring (the Prism) to the market first. A lot of the ideas we are working on are totally different to Palm.\" He expresses cynicism about the e-wallet project (in which your PDA stores credit card details and beams them to special terminals to pay for items), which Palm announced in January. January also saw the first public demonstration of a voice control system for the Microsoft Pocket PC PDA platform. But Handspring won't be following on Bill Gate's coat-tails. \"I've seen impressive voice command demos for 10 years, and I'm still not convinced it will work with a PDA.\" He also feels that Bluetooth could be a \"potential red herring\". \"Sure, people will use it to connect phones to their organisers, but as for location-based services where shops send you messages when you walk buy - that's just a pipe dream. \"When we worked on the Palm, we knew we were on to something big. It was just that for a while we were the only people who believed we could pull it off.\" There's a similar cynicism about the migration from PDAs to connected devices now. Maybe in 10 years' time, Colligan will be saying something similar about Handspring, too.",

Frank is also available to act as your guide for a Gangland Tour through London's East End. </p> <p>These sites form part of the UK Hardman and Gangster Web Ring. You can link up to the entire list at <a href=\"http://www.davecourtney.org.uk\">www.davecourtney.org.uk</a>. Dave Courtney, whose career inspired the Vinnie Jones character in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, has two websites, the flashier of which is at <a href=\"http://www.davecourtney.com\">www.davecourtney.com</a>. Here you will find sound, streaming video, and a collection of articles about the man they call \"the original fun-loving criminal\". </p> <p>Criminals' sites are often managed by fans, whose own lives appear to be a million miles away from anything approaching the underworld. Mike Grey, who styles himself as \"the owner of the largest collection of Biggs memorabilia\", helps run <a href=\"http://www.ronniebiggs.com\">www.ronniebiggs.com</a> for the Great British Train Robber, still holed up in Rio, aged 71. Grey's fascination with the robber began when he had to do an A level English project on any news story in 1974 - and he chose Biggs. </p> <p>On the whole, the fans seem internet-literate and dedicated enough to put in the hard work that maintaining a site demands. </p> <p>The introductory page of <a href=\"http://www.thekrays.co.uk\">The Krays</a>, however, has yet to acknowledge Reggie Kray's death in October last year - a conspicuous oversight, especially as the rest of the site appears to be up to date. </p> <p>The Krays has a long and apparently sincere bulletin board-style condolence book. Anyone suggesting that, actually, the streets weren't safer when the Krays were about, or that, truth be told, not everyone adored them, is quickly frowned on. Rather optimistically, contributors are confident that all three Kray brothers \"are now in heaven\", and they are \"loved by millions\". Spelling is, however, erratic. At one point, Charlie Kray is described as \"a lovable rouge\". </p> <p>Of course, they tend to do things bigger in the US. Organised crime UK-style is a vicarage tea party compared to the viciousness of La Cosa Nostra. For a detailed overview of the whole scene, visit <a href=\"http://www.ganglandnews.com\">Jerry Capeci's Gang Land</a>. It was on to this site that young Meadow Soprano (of the hit HBO series The Sopranos) logged to convince her kid brother that when dad Tony said his job was in waste management, he wasn't exactly telling the whole story. </p> <p>The Sopranos naturally has its <a href=\"http://sopranos.hbo.com\" target=\"_new\">own site</a>.

Or bid in a cyberauction for one of Charlie's possessions, such as his knuckle duster, or even his brain (a deal to be honoured post-mortem, to prevent the Home Office nabbing it) - all proceeds to \"Bronson's Children\" charity, which aims to raise a million for a further prosecution of Myra Hindley and Ian Brady. That life on the outside can be one long Rent-a-Memory played out for an uncritical audience is exemplified by Mad Frankie Fraser, the former Kray associate who is currently selling his own interactive CD-rom (\"chilling, unrepentant and at times funny and heart-warming\", according to the sales pitch). Frank is also available to act as your guide for a Gangland Tour through London's East End. These sites form part of the UK Hardman and Gangster Web Ring. You can link up to the entire list at www.davecourtney.org.uk. Dave Courtney, whose career inspired the Vinnie Jones character in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, has two websites, the flashier of which is at www.davecourtney.com. Here you will find sound, streaming video, and a collection of articles about the man they call \"the original fun-loving criminal\". Criminals' sites are often managed by fans, whose own lives appear to be a million miles away from anything approaching the underworld. Mike Grey, who styles himself as \"the owner of the largest collection of Biggs memorabilia\", helps run www.ronniebiggs.com for the Great British Train Robber, still holed up in Rio, aged 71. Grey's fascination with the robber began when he had to do an A level English project on any news story in 1974 - and he chose Biggs. On the whole, the fans seem internet-literate and dedicated enough to put in the hard work that maintaining a site demands. The introductory page of The Krays, however, has yet to acknowledge Reggie Kray's death in October last year - a conspicuous oversight, especially as the rest of the site appears to be up to date. The Krays has a long and apparently sincere bulletin board-style condolence book. Anyone suggesting that, actually, the streets weren't safer when the Krays were about, or that, truth be told, not everyone adored them, is quickly frowned on. Rather optimistically, contributors are confident that all three Kray brothers \"are now in heaven\", and they are \"loved by millions\". Spelling is, however, erratic. At one point, Charlie Kray is described as \"a lovable rouge\". Of course, they tend to do things bigger in the US. Organised crime UK-style is a vicarage tea party compared to the viciousness of La Cosa Nostra. For a detailed overview of the whole scene, visit Jerry Capeci's Gang Land. It was on to this site that young Meadow Soprano (of the hit HBO series The Sopranos) logged to convince her kid brother that when dad Tony said his job was in waste management, he wasn't exactly telling the whole story. The Sopranos naturally has its own site. And while we are talking drama, the highly recommended Godfather Trilogy - the Website You Can't Refuse at www.exit109.com/~jgeoff/ godfather/godfathr.shtml has whole scripts, and a set of frequently asked questions to satisfy the most trivia-obsessed. However, to find out whether the horse's head in the bed was actually a different horse from the one seen earlier in the stables, you will need to visit Nitpickers www.nitpickers.com/movies/ nitpicks/titles/88174.html. If you want to understand underworld lingo, either real or fictional, check out the difference between a BG (someone who has not yet shot anyone) and an OG (someone who has) and other US gang argot at http://linz.orf.at/gast/shocky/gang-slang.htm. For UK prison slang, HM Prisons issues a primly sanitised glossary of terms see www.hmprisonservice.gov.uk.

A hectic marketing campaign has been started, including offering free tickets to celebrities such as Esther Rantzen and Joanna Lumley.</p> <p>An ROH spokesman said yesterday: \"There is no panic at all about it. We always knew we would have to work much harder to market this than a more familiar piece.</p> <p>He added: \"The point of inviting people like Esther Rantzen to the first night is to get the chattering classes chattering about something they might not normally contemplate attending. It's not about inviting some minor figure in a sensational frock to get a few pars in the paper - that's not our thing.\"</p> <p>The problems raised uncomfortable echoes of Covent Garden's last venture into unknown contemporary opera, when the entire season of Gyorgy Ligeti's Le Grand Macabre was abandoned weeks before the reopening, to gain desperately needed extra rehearsal time for more successful shows.</p> <p>But observers from other institutions were sympathetic. \"You have to hold your nerve, get the marketing right, and build the trust of your audience, and that takes time,\" said Amelia Freedman, head of classical music at the South Bank complex.</p> <p>The South Bank is currently mounting a festival of the music of Henze.</p> <p>At English National Opera, a spokesman said that contemporary work was marketed far more aggressively than the classics.

      "bodyText": "The Royal Opera House yesterday admitted it was resorting to discounting seats, special offers and celebrity first night guests, for the first time since it reopened last year, after disastrous ticket sales for a contemporary opera. Boulevard Solitude, a reworking of Manon Lescaut, first performed in 1952, is being staged as a 75th birthday tribute to the German composer Hans Werner Henze. As of yesterday morning under a third of the seats had been sold for the six performances. A hectic marketing campaign has been started, including offering free tickets to celebrities such as Esther Rantzen and Joanna Lumley. An ROH spokesman said yesterday: \"There is no panic at all about it. We always knew we would have to work much harder to market this than a more familiar piece. He added: \"The point of inviting people like Esther Rantzen to the first night is to get the chattering classes chattering about something they might not normally contemplate attending. It's not about inviting some minor figure in a sensational frock to get a few pars in the paper - that's not our thing.\" The problems raised uncomfortable echoes of Covent Garden's last venture into unknown contemporary opera, when the entire season of Gyorgy Ligeti's Le Grand Macabre was abandoned weeks before the reopening, to gain desperately needed extra rehearsal time for more successful shows. But observers from other institutions were sympathetic. \"You have to hold your nerve, get the marketing right, and build the trust of your audience, and that takes time,\" said Amelia Freedman, head of classical music at the South Bank complex. The South Bank is currently mounting a festival of the music of Henze. At English National Opera, a spokesman said that contemporary work was marketed far more aggressively than the classics. At the Barbican, artistic director Graham Sheffield said he believed the audience for contemporary work was growing. But he added: \"We now have a relationship of trust with our audience. But that takes time and we never take it for granted.\" One of Covent Garden's fiercest critics, the impresario Raymond Gubbay, who pitched to become the new director last year, was unexpectedly sympathetic. \"Henze is a great composer, and hats off to them in a way for putting him on - it's just what you should be doing with a subsidy,\" he said. \"But you are never going to get people paying \u00a3115 for that, for God's sake. You've got to have some sense of how to market it. \"The trouble is the audience they have got at Covent Garden is just too elite, they want to pay a lot of money to go and see a show they know, packed with stars.\" Gubbay's production of Aida, which sold 2,000 seats every night of its Albert Hall run, is now packing audiences in on a provincial tour. He added: \"I'd put on Boulevard Solitude myself, Henze is great. But I wouldn't put it on at the Albert Hall, no way.\"",

      "bodyText": "Are you an obsessive lover of routine, overconscientious, and think cleanliness is next to godliness? Beware. You may be nearly twice as likely to die from a heart attack as more laid back friends and colleagues. A study of more than 1,400 men lasting 20 years also suggests that similar risks face those who display physical signs of anxiety such as palpitations, sweating, sleep disturbance and indigestion. If that is not enough, men with phobias, such as fear of open spaces, are more prone to a coronary too - but that propensity seems to dwindle with age and was a key factor only in those who died during the first 10 years of the study. The results of work that can only encourage the need to \"chill out\", and try to develop an inner calm, are revealed in the medical journal Heart today. The researchers, who monitored workers in local government, a food processing company and the Post Office, suggest that more middle-aged men may benefit from behavioural therapy in an effort to curb Britain's most notorious killer disease. It might be difficult to identify potential victims. All the men involved - of whom 127 died from a heart attack - displayed no obvious signs of cardiac problems when recruited between the ages of 40 and 64.

Those who died had significantly higher scores after adjustments for factors such as smoking, age and social class. The authors, while recognising the study, based on white men in London, was relatively small, conclude that psychological factors are likely to increase the risk of fatal heart attack. Andrew Haines, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said yesterday: \"These were essentially fit working people who had no signs of heart disease at the beginning.

For a short time, Gay Dad were everywhere, their \"walking man\" logo reproduced on posters and magazine covers before they had even released a record. Fifteen labels competed for them on the strength of a demo tape and a few messianic soundbites from Jones, a former rock critic, whose self-belief (\"Gay Dad are an avatar to aheadness,\" was a typically modest claim) made him the most talked-about new face of 1999. </p> <p>\"Sadly misunderstood,\" he sighs now, peering out from under a blue wool cap that covers the upper half of his face. \"They thought we were a brand, not a band.\" He pulls the cap further over his eyes. If it's anonymity he wants this rainy afternoon, he's chosen the right place: the dim upper room of a Soho drinking club, whose only other inmates are drummer Baz Crowe, bassist Nigel Hoyle and, across the room, three City types. He's referring to the treatment meted out to the group once they released their first single, To Earth With Love. It was perfectly engaging but an avatar to nothing much but raucous pop-metal.

He has had plenty of time to think this over, and promptly says: \"Don't you dare draw any parallels between us and Sigue Sigue Sputnik.\" While Sputnik colluded in their myth-making, Gay Dad claim they were innocent victims of a media onslaught. </p> <p>\"We had good ideas, and good ideas attract more attention than bad ideas.

And we fatally got tagged as glam because of one line in a song, 'Put your platforms on.' It was meant to be ironic, but people can't get past the UK's irony curtain. We're the nets in front of the irony curtain,\" he adds with a sudden smile. </p> <p>Jones is an entertaining conversationalist, who might better be suited to a Paul Morleyish role, using his journalistic skills as Morley does as \"artistic director\" of the Art of Noise. Not that this is likely: he's too high on the idea of being a frontman, interviewee rather than interviewer. </p> <p>\"The only thing that's ever been relevant to us is soul and integrity,\" he's saying passionately. As if to emphasise it, he has gone in for a prudent bit of image-tweaking. The peroxide bouffant do is gone; in its place a sober brown fringe.

      "body": "<p>Sometimes it feels as though women's bodies exist only to tell lies with. A slick of gloss, a layer of elastic, an injection of collagen - femininity is contructed to the extent that nothing need be natural anymore, least of all the \"natural look\". Who do you want to be today?</p> <p>And so it is with breasts. This week, Gossard upped the ante in the quest for the ultimate cleavage, with the launch of the Ultrabra Airotics, which features a cresent-shaped airbag in each cup. The bra comes with a small rubber pump, allowing the wearer to inflate and deflate as circumstance requires.</p> <p>And for those who prefer a more holistic approach, chemists will soon be stocking a Dutch-manufactured \"miracle pill\", containing plant-derived hormones that boost breast size by mimicking the action of human oestrogen.</p> <p>It would seem that women have an insatiable appetite for products and services to shape, firm, support, train or even mutilate their breasts. We spend millions on creating an illusion that will - we are told - increase our sexual and social worth. And a standard has emerged, from a generation of Pamela Andersonalike starlets, of tight, pert hemispheres grafted on to a hip-less boy's body.</p> <p>Every celebrity snapshot now invites the same litany: are they real? What has she done with her nipples? Are they held up with tape/wire/ a team of specially trained mice?</p> <p>As Naomi Wolf writes in The Beauty Myth, there now exists an Official Breast that gives no hint of maternal function. \"The breast that is high but also large and firm is most likely to belong to a teenager. In a culture which fears the price of women's sexual self-confidence, that breast is the reassuring guarantee of extreme youth - sexual ignorance and infertility.\"</p> <p>We know what our breasts mean to other people: babies see food, men see sex, the doctor sees disease, the analyst sees the root of psychosexual disturbance. Lingerie designers see cash, magazine publishers see cash, advertising agencies see cash, global business sees cash. In the breast-obsessed west, you can sell almost anything you want to with a nice pair of tits, including yourself.</p> <p>We know what our breasts mean to other people, but what do they mean to us? They belong to us, though everywhere they are annexed. But women aren't simply docile victims of commercial and cultural oppression. Sometimes it's a game, this shape we present to an appraising world. Sometimes it's powerful.</p> <p>What do we really see when we look in the mirror: a symbol and flesh, potency and vulnerability, the maternal and the erotic. We see memories: of being a girl, a lover, a mother. In private, apart from the cult of comparison, unassailed by public sex, we can wonder about the woman we are, the woman we fantasise about being, and why.</p> <p>My mother tells me that when she was breastfeeding me, I would play with a small mole by her left breast. A couple of years ago, I discovered a similar mole just below my left armpit. It made me smile.</p> <p><b> Joanna Taylor, 30 and 36B, is married to Steve and works for Sh! women's sex shop in north London.</b></p> <p>I'd always expected to have bigger breasts than I do because my mum's are bigger. When I realised they weren't going to be as large as I'd thought, it was a bit of a letdown. But my husband seems happy with them and I've accepted them as part of me. There are lots of bits of my body I don't much like but I have tried to tell myself that this is my body and I must treat it nicely and not hate it. I have grown to accept my not tiny and not huge breasts - I'm actually quite pleased they're not huge because they'd sag when I got older and might give me backache. But I hear these stories about women whose breasts get smaller after having children and I think, my God, I don't want that to happen.</p> <p>We are constantly bombarded with images of what the perfect woman is supposed to look like and I think both men and women look at women's breasts. My female friends and I will admire a nice cleavage on another woman and I might get a pang of envy, but I know I'm loved by my husband the way I am.</p> <p>I think some men always check out a woman's breasts. A friend with large breasts was walking down the street when a man she'd never seen before came up and said: \"Nice tits\" then just walked off. On the one hand that sort of behaviour is offensive but on the other at least he's being honest and saying straight out what a lot of men would have been thinking.</p> <p>I don't need a man to validate my breasts but I do sometimes look in the mirror and think, yuk, I'm having a bad boob day today. At times like that, it helps if you know you're loved. I think having nice breasts and showing them off does make you feel womanly, but whether that is a male-imposed value, I don't know.</p> <p><b> Vanessa Moon, 35 and 34B, is a painter and has two children.</b></p> <p>When I was little, I couldn't wait to develop breasts. Happily they arrived quite early and by the age of 11, I was the proud owner of a 29AA pink gingham bra. I still remember that bra with joy; it was a beautiful moment in my life. I'm not sure why I felt so excited about my new breasts but I felt the same about my first pair of high heels and my first period.</p> <p>I maintained that happy relationship with my breasts throughout adolescence but I lost touch with them and certainly lost joy in them when I began to have relationships with men. Although I had been very content with them before, I suddenly felt they weren't good enough or enough like so-and-so's in the media. I felt that they became objects for men rather than things for me.</p> <p>I breastfed my children for quite a long time and as a result my breasts became enormous and like two alien beings attached to me. They were linked to children rather than to me.</p> <p>I think the public face of breasts has changed a lot in recent years. They are much more in your face, implanted, modified and pumped up, and I worry how these images will rub off on my daughter. I'm not that well-endowed and when I lie down, she points to my breasts and says: \"They've disappeared.\" I tell her that's what they're supposed to do because they're not full of silicone.</p> <p>When I left my husband and came out as a lesbian four years ago, my attitude to my breasts changed completely - both men and women have generally been quite approving of them but I can accept that praise from a woman better than from a man. At the moment I feel very positive in my own body space. My breasts aren't perfect but I'm very comfortable with them. I'm back to that joyous pink gingham bra stage.</p> <p><b>Sharon Moylan, 37 and 34C, lives with her husband Michael and children Rebecca, nine, and Sonny, six. She works for IKEA and five years ago had cosmetic surgery to increase her breast size.</b></p> <p>I hadn't noticed there was anything wrong with my breasts until a couple of people commented that they used to be larger. I was fortunate when I was younger that I was a 34B or 34C. I never gave the size or shape of my breasts much thought, but after I breastfed and then lost quite a lot of weight, they seemed to disappear and I started to think how much nicer I'd looked in dresses before.</p> <p>I'm quite impulsive and I made the decision quickly, after seeing a few surgeons. I know you hear negative things about implants but I haven't had any problems with them. They're as good as the day I had them put in and my breasts are more or less back to what they were before I had the children, only I appreciate them more this time round. I can wear strappy dresses without a bra and they don't bounce around when I move. At a wedding recently, I wore something low-cut and five men came up and told me my breasts looked brilliant.</p> <p>I think there is undoubtedly more pressure now from the media for women to have perfect breasts but I didn't have implants because of media pressure or pressure from any man. Quite a few men have told me they actually don't like big breasts. As for my husband, he'd always said he was happy if I was happy and that he liked me as I was - but he really likes my breasts now and thinks they're well worth the money.</p> <p>One thing I would say to women who have their boobs done is go out and buy yourself a decent cardigan. In certain situations if you wear a low-cut top you can get leered at. When I do show my breasts off, it's on my terms, not someone else's.</p>",

And for those who prefer a more holistic approach, chemists will soon be stocking a Dutch-manufactured \"miracle pill\", containing plant-derived hormones that boost breast size by mimicking the action of human oestrogen. It would seem that women have an insatiable appetite for products and services to shape, firm, support, train or even mutilate their breasts. We spend millions on creating an illusion that will - we are told - increase our sexual and social worth. And a standard has emerged, from a generation of Pamela Andersonalike starlets, of tight, pert hemispheres grafted on to a hip-less boy's body. Every celebrity snapshot now invites the same litany: are they real? What has she done with her nipples? Are they held up with tape/wire/ a team of specially trained mice? As Naomi Wolf writes in The Beauty Myth, there now exists an Official Breast that gives no hint of maternal function. \"The breast that is high but also large and firm is most likely to belong to a teenager. In a culture which fears the price of women's sexual self-confidence, that breast is the reassuring guarantee of extreme youth - sexual ignorance and infertility.\" We know what our breasts mean to other people: babies see food, men see sex, the doctor sees disease, the analyst sees the root of psychosexual disturbance. Lingerie designers see cash, magazine publishers see cash, advertising agencies see cash, global business sees cash. In the breast-obsessed west, you can sell almost anything you want to with a nice pair of tits, including yourself. We know what our breasts mean to other people, but what do they mean to us? They belong to us, though everywhere they are annexed. But women aren't simply docile victims of commercial and cultural oppression. Sometimes it's a game, this shape we present to an appraising world. Sometimes it's powerful. What do we really see when we look in the mirror: a symbol and flesh, potency and vulnerability, the maternal and the erotic. We see memories: of being a girl, a lover, a mother. In private, apart from the cult of comparison, unassailed by public sex, we can wonder about the woman we are, the woman we fantasise about being, and why. My mother tells me that when she was breastfeeding me, I would play with a small mole by her left breast. A couple of years ago, I discovered a similar mole just below my left armpit. It made me smile. Joanna Taylor, 30 and 36B, is married to Steve and works for Sh! women's sex shop in north London. I'd always expected to have bigger breasts than I do because my mum's are bigger. When I realised they weren't going to be as large as I'd thought, it was a bit of a letdown. But my husband seems happy with them and I've accepted them as part of me. There are lots of bits of my body I don't much like but I have tried to tell myself that this is my body and I must treat it nicely and not hate it. I have grown to accept my not tiny and not huge breasts - I'm actually quite pleased they're not huge because they'd sag when I got older and might give me backache. But I hear these stories about women whose breasts get smaller after having children and I think, my God, I don't want that to happen. We are constantly bombarded with images of what the perfect woman is supposed to look like and I think both men and women look at women's breasts. My female friends and I will admire a nice cleavage on another woman and I might get a pang of envy, but I know I'm loved by my husband the way I am. I think some men always check out a woman's breasts. A friend with large breasts was walking down the street when a man she'd never seen before came up and said: \"Nice tits\" then just walked off. On the one hand that sort of behaviour is offensive but on the other at least he's being honest and saying straight out what a lot of men would have been thinking. I don't need a man to validate my breasts but I do sometimes look in the mirror and think, yuk, I'm having a bad boob day today. At times like that, it helps if you know you're loved. I think having nice breasts and showing them off does make you feel womanly, but whether that is a male-imposed value, I don't know. Vanessa Moon, 35 and 34B, is a painter and has two children. When I was little, I couldn't wait to develop breasts. Happily they arrived quite early and by the age of 11, I was the proud owner of a 29AA pink gingham bra. I still remember that bra with joy; it was a beautiful moment in my life. I'm not sure why I felt so excited about my new breasts but I felt the same about my first pair of high heels and my first period. I maintained that happy relationship with my breasts throughout adolescence but I lost touch with them and certainly lost joy in them when I began to have relationships with men. Although I had been very content with them before, I suddenly felt they weren't good enough or enough like so-and-so's in the media. I felt that they became objects for men rather than things for me. I breastfed my children for quite a long time and as a result my breasts became enormous and like two alien beings attached to me. They were linked to children rather than to me. I think the public face of breasts has changed a lot in recent years. They are much more in your face, implanted, modified and pumped up, and I worry how these images will rub off on my daughter. I'm not that well-endowed and when I lie down, she points to my breasts and says: \"They've disappeared.\" I tell her that's what they're supposed to do because they're not full of silicone. When I left my husband and came out as a lesbian four years ago, my attitude to my breasts changed completely - both men and women have generally been quite approving of them but I can accept that praise from a woman better than from a man. At the moment I feel very positive in my own body space. My breasts aren't perfect but I'm very comfortable with them. I'm back to that joyous pink gingham bra stage. Sharon Moylan, 37 and 34C, lives with her husband Michael and children Rebecca, nine, and Sonny, six. She works for IKEA and five years ago had cosmetic surgery to increase her breast size. I hadn't noticed there was anything wrong with my breasts until a couple of people commented that they used to be larger. I was fortunate when I was younger that I was a 34B or 34C. I never gave the size or shape of my breasts much thought, but after I breastfed and then lost quite a lot of weight, they seemed to disappear and I started to think how much nicer I'd looked in dresses before. I'm quite impulsive and I made the decision quickly, after seeing a few surgeons. I know you hear negative things about implants but I haven't had any problems with them. They're as good as the day I had them put in and my breasts are more or less back to what they were before I had the children, only I appreciate them more this time round. I can wear strappy dresses without a bra and they don't bounce around when I move. At a wedding recently, I wore something low-cut and five men came up and told me my breasts looked brilliant. I think there is undoubtedly more pressure now from the media for women to have perfect breasts but I didn't have implants because of media pressure or pressure from any man. Quite a few men have told me they actually don't like big breasts. As for my husband, he'd always said he was happy if I was happy and that he liked me as I was - but he really likes my breasts now and thinks they're well worth the money. One thing I would say to women who have their boobs done is go out and buy yourself a decent cardigan. In certain situations if you wear a low-cut top you can get leered at. When I do show my breasts off, it's on my terms, not someone else's.",

He insisted that the rebels should be allowed to address both houses from the congressional podium.</p> <p>\"We will not accept a shaming dialogue with the legislative power, limited to a corner and with a reduced number of legislators.\" Marcos said.</p> <p>The offer was made by the congressional peace commission after Marcos and 23 other Zapatista leaders made a triumphal entrance into the centre of the capital on Sunday after a two-week march to demand constitutional rights for the 10m indigenous people.</p> <p>But Marcos accused congressional \"hardliners\" of pressurising the peace commission in an attempt to sabotage the negotiating of an end to the conflict in Chiapas state that began when the Zapatistas staged an armed uprising on New Year's Day, 1994.</p> <p>The Zapatistas' disappointment with the commission was such that they would now bypass it and seek direct talks with the leaders of the congressional party blocs, he said.</p> <p>The commission yesterday called a closed-door meeting to decide how to respond to the rejection of its offer.</p> <p>Next month, the congress is due to discuss an indigenous rights bill elaborated from partial peace accords signed in February 1996. Those accords were shelved by the previous administration of President Ernesto Zedillo, prompting the Zapatistas to abandon the negotiations and return to their jungle bases in the southern state.</p> <p>Mexico's new president, Vicente Fox, dusted off the bill and sent it to the legislature as soon as he took office last December, raising hopes for peace and prompting the rebels to organise their unarmed march on the capital.</p> <p>Marcos has announced that the rebels will not leave the capital until the congress approves the bill. He says approval is a non-negotiable condition for starting peace talks.</p> <p>The Zapatistas also insist on the release of all their jailed supporters and the withdrawal of three military bases near their strongholds. They reject as inadequate the dismantling of four bases and the partial prisoner release programme Mr Fox has ordered so far.</p> <p>But the key issue is the bill.

      "bodyText": "The Zapatista rebels have rejected a proposal for opening talks with Mexico's national congress on the constitutional recognition of indigenous rights they demand. Subcomandante Marcos said a plan for a 20-strong commission of deputies and senators to meet Zapatista commanders in the upper house of congress was \"humiliating, undignified and ridiculous\". He insisted that the rebels should be allowed to address both houses from the congressional podium. \"We will not accept a shaming dialogue with the legislative power, limited to a corner and with a reduced number of legislators.\" Marcos said. The offer was made by the congressional peace commission after Marcos and 23 other Zapatista leaders made a triumphal entrance into the centre of the capital on Sunday after a two-week march to demand constitutional rights for the 10m indigenous people. But Marcos accused congressional \"hardliners\" of pressurising the peace commission in an attempt to sabotage the negotiating of an end to the conflict in Chiapas state that began when the Zapatistas staged an armed uprising on New Year's Day, 1994. The Zapatistas' disappointment with the commission was such that they would now bypass it and seek direct talks with the leaders of the congressional party blocs, he said. The commission yesterday called a closed-door meeting to decide how to respond to the rejection of its offer. Next month, the congress is due to discuss an indigenous rights bill elaborated from partial peace accords signed in February 1996. Those accords were shelved by the previous administration of President Ernesto Zedillo, prompting the Zapatistas to abandon the negotiations and return to their jungle bases in the southern state. Mexico's new president, Vicente Fox, dusted off the bill and sent it to the legislature as soon as he took office last December, raising hopes for peace and prompting the rebels to organise their unarmed march on the capital. Marcos has announced that the rebels will not leave the capital until the congress approves the bill. He says approval is a non-negotiable condition for starting peace talks. The Zapatistas also insist on the release of all their jailed supporters and the withdrawal of three military bases near their strongholds. They reject as inadequate the dismantling of four bases and the partial prisoner release programme Mr Fox has ordered so far. But the key issue is the bill. Despite the government's support and a groundswell of national sentiment in the measure's favour, the congressional situation is tricky. No single party has a simple majority and several appear split on the bill. The law would grant indigenous communities significant autonomy in the way they run their communities, and enshrine their right to live by traditions that differ from traditional Mexican forms of authority. Election decisions involving indigenous commu nities, for instance, would be taken collectively and not individually. Some prominent members of Mr Fox's National Action party have expressed concerns that this could threaten national unity and undermine individual rights, pointing to the secondary position of women in several of Mexico's dozens of indigenous groups. The rebels have never represented a serious military threat, but their national and international appeal is such that the previous government opted not to attempt a politically costly eradication campaign and instead followed a containment policy aimed at eroding their popular support. Mr Fox is impatient for a peace accord that would improve Mexico's image abroad in the wake of his defeat of the 71-year-old regime of the Institutional Revolutionary party. He has welcomed the Zapatista march on the capital as a sign that peace is just around the corner, but the early hitch in the congressional talks will make him think again.",

Paul Foulkes-Halbard, 63, a former racing driver nicknamed \"the flying farmer\", yesterday claimed he owned the craft which crashed and sank, killing its skipper, Donald Campbell, in 1967. Mr Foulkes-Halbard said he had papers to prove it and was going to put the craft on a trailer and tow it to his fortified medieval manor house in East Sussex, where he has what is billed as the world's largest collection of Campbell memorabilia. Residents of Coniston, with the reported support of Campbell's widow, Tonia Bern-Campbell, 64, said that Cumbria was the rightful home of Bluebird and it should be kept there in a purpose-built museum. Campbell was 45 when he attempted to break his world water speed record on Coniston. The craft left the water, turned over, and crashed down into the 150ft deep lake.

Grey with the incessant drizzle that fell from a heavy sky, grey with the grim faces of the few inhabitants venturing on to its streets, grey with the knowledge that two miles up the road was the farm that harboured France's first - and certainly not its last - case of foot and mouth disease.</p> <p>\"So the miracle never happened,\" said Paul Conneau, a local beef farmer, nursing a glass in the all but empty Le Brazza bar overlooking the square. \"The longer the wait went on, the more we all began to think we might have escaped.

Only a handful did and none of them much wanted to talk.</p> <p>\"You can just about see the smoke from here,\" said Jacqueline, the wife of a dairy farmer in the quarantined hamlet of La Baroche-Gondoin. \"It's taking two days to burn all Francis's cows. They brought more fuel in at lunchtime, a big trailer load of wood. This region is only farms, you know. I don't know what we'll do.\"</p> <p>The authorities in nearby Laval, the capital of the Mayenne department, say there are 47 herds of cattle, pigs and sheep within the first security perimeter surrounding Mr Leroyer's farm, and some 550 within the surveillance zone, policed by 200 gendarmes, extending five miles beyond.</p> <p>Jean-Francois Rebout is the dealer in La Baroche-Gondoin whose imported Herefordshire sheep infected six of Francis Leroyer's 114-strong herd of Holstein cows. All the sheep were slaughtered two weeks ago but the two men's farms, L'Agneau mayennais and La Haye, are separated only by a narrow road.</p> <p>Reached by telephone, Mr Rebout said he could not believe the disease would not now spread further: he had sold 4,500 sheep to all parts of France since importing his three British flocks. He said he felt so bad for his neighbour, he didn't really know what to say to him.</p> <p>\"I just buy sheep and sell them on,\" Mr Rebout said. \"It's much worse for him, he raises his cows. He saw them being born. And he really has the model farm, you should see it. It's clean like I don't know what, mown lawn and everything. He had put in all the footbaths and disinfectants. He didn't deserve this, he really didn't.\"</p> <p>Mr Leroyer is 57, three years away from retirement. He had spent 30 years building up his herd of Holsteins, his sole source of income. He was calm on the phone, trying hard to see something positive in what had befallen him.</p> <p>\"It took the vets a whole night to put my cows down,\" he said. \"Then the firemen lit the first fire at about 8.30 in the morning. I couldn't watch, of course I couldn't. It's almost unimaginable what's happening to us, a lifetime up in flames. All I hope is that this sacrifice will be worth it and that the whole thing stops here.\"</p> <p>Back in town, they weren't so sure it would. \"Foxes can carry it,\" said Philippe, whose agency handles the insurance business of two dozen local farms. \"What do you do about them, and birds, even the wind? It moves so fast, this disease. It's everyone's nightmare.\"</p> <p>Oddly, maybe, for British sensibilities, no one was out to get the English; there was solidarity among farmers. Instead, the farmers of Lassay-les-Chateaux rounded on French farmers' perennial target: Paris, the ministry of agriculture, the bloody government.</p> <p>\"English farmers didn't want this either, did they?\" said Roger Sochon, 54, who has 20 head of cattle inside the first security zone. \"Not their fault, is it? But how come those sheep were allowed into France? When I buy a cow, I have to get a certificate for it, get it checked.\"</p> <p>His dungaree-clad neighbour, who refused to give his name, joined in. \"And why the hell did we ever stop vaccinating against foot and mouth - whose decision was that? The union's taking legal advice on taking them to court, see whether all the precautions were taken. It's just like BSE: Paris does too little, too late. And it's us that suffer.

All I hope is that this sacrifice will be worth it and that the whole thing stops here.\" Back in town, they weren't so sure it would. \"Foxes can carry it,\" said Philippe, whose agency handles the insurance business of two dozen local farms. \"What do you do about them, and birds, even the wind? It moves so fast, this disease. It's everyone's nightmare.\" Oddly, maybe, for British sensibilities, no one was out to get the English; there was solidarity among farmers. Instead, the farmers of Lassay-les-Chateaux rounded on French farmers' perennial target: Paris, the ministry of agriculture, the bloody government. \"English farmers didn't want this either, did they?\" said Roger Sochon, 54, who has 20 head of cattle inside the first security zone. \"Not their fault, is it? But how come those sheep were allowed into France? When I buy a cow, I have to get a certificate for it, get it checked.\" His dungaree-clad neighbour, who refused to give his name, joined in. \"And why the hell did we ever stop vaccinating against foot and mouth - whose decision was that? The union's taking legal advice on taking them to court, see whether all the precautions were taken. It's just like BSE: Paris does too little, too late. And it's us that suffer.

One leading chain said that pork prices had gone up because UK processors were charging more -from \u00a33.29 for a kilo of chops to \u00a33.59, while increased air freight charges had pushed up the price of imported New Zealand lamb. </p> <p><b> Sport and leisure</b><br> </p> <p> The foot and mouth crisis has dealt the harshest blow to rugby and horse racing, both sports with strong links to rural communities. </p> <p>Horse racing has been the biggest loser. Racing in the UK was suspended within days of the disease being diagnosed and for seven days the tracks remained quiet at an estimated cost of around \u00a3600,000 per cancelled meeting. Yesterday the British Horseracing Board (BHB) estimated that the cost of the week-long shutdown was \u00a315m, a figure that includes betting revenues. </p> <p>Chairman Peter Savill said a month-long shutdown would cost \u00a360m, and argued that a programme of fixtures be maintained to protect jobs. </p> <p>The outbreak led to the postponement of the Cheltenham Festival, the climax of the National Hunt season and an event crucial to the economic wellbeing of the town. Around 150,000 people visit annually, pouring around \u00a310m into local coffers. It will now take place on April 17-19. </p> <p>Key Six Nations rugby union championship fixtures have also been cancelled. The Wales-Scotland match scheduled for Cardiff earlier this month was axed, costing the Welsh Rugby Football Union \u00a35-\u00a36m in lost revenues. The cost to Cardiff's hoteliers, restaurants and bars has been put at \u00a37m. </p> <p>Next weekend's match between Ireland and England in Dublin has also been cancelled, but this weekend's match in Paris between France and Wales will go ahead. The French agriculture minister ruled that 3,000 visiting Welshmen is a negligible risk compared with the 70,000 Britons who travel to France on a daily basis. </p> <p>The English Rugby Football Union estimate that ticket sales alone at Twickenham bring in \u00a33m per match, and are hopeful that next month's France game will go ahead. </p> <p><br><br><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

Chairman Peter Savill said a month-long shutdown would cost \u00a360m, and argued that a programme of fixtures be maintained to protect jobs. The outbreak led to the postponement of the Cheltenham Festival, the climax of the National Hunt season and an event crucial to the economic wellbeing of the town. Around 150,000 people visit annually, pouring around \u00a310m into local coffers. It will now take place on April 17-19. Key Six Nations rugby union championship fixtures have also been cancelled. The Wales-Scotland match scheduled for Cardiff earlier this month was axed, costing the Welsh Rugby Football Union \u00a35-\u00a36m in lost revenues. The cost to Cardiff's hoteliers, restaurants and bars has been put at \u00a37m. Next weekend's match between Ireland and England in Dublin has also been cancelled, but this weekend's match in Paris between France and Wales will go ahead. The French agriculture minister ruled that 3,000 visiting Welshmen is a negligible risk compared with the 70,000 Britons who travel to France on a daily basis. The English Rugby Football Union estimate that ticket sales alone at Twickenham bring in \u00a33m per match, and are hopeful that next month's France game will go ahead. What's going on?

News that Brian Nelson would not face charges came as relatives of Mr Finucane, shot dead by loyalists 12 years ago, arrived in Washington to press for help in getting a judicial inquiry into the killing, in which they believe security forces were also involved. Nelson worked for the Force Research Unit, at the centre of allegations of collusion between terrorists and security forces being investigated by the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens. Nelson was both a military intelligence spy and a senior member of the Ulster Defence Association, the Protestant paramilitaries blamed for the murder; Mr Finucane was shot dead in front of his wife and children at their home in 1989. Nelson was jailed for 10 years for a series of offences, including conspiracy to murder and having information useful to terrorists. Charges of murdering two Catholics were withdrawn. He now lives at a secret address in England. A spokesman for the Stevens inquiry declined to say if it had interviewed Nelson. But a security source said he had been questioned in London in January, and had been recently informed he would not be charged. Paul O'Connor, coordinator for the Pat Finucane Centre, said last night: \"It beggars belief that a decision like this could be made at this early stage, before the investigation is even complete.\" One man has been charged with aiding and abetting in the Finucane murder, and is due to stand trial later this year. He is William Stobie from Belfast, an ex-UDA man and self-confessed former RUC special branch agent.

Last year Woolworths made \u00a391m, he points out, just about the same as John Lewis, and everyone reckons John Lewis could easily float. But it is hard to see Woolworths as a separately quoted company in the current climate. </p> <p>John Lewis is regarded as a prestige business, while Woolworths is a store that no self-respecting City analyst would be seen dead in and is largely viewed as a ragbag, unfocused chain which does not know its target audience. </p> <p>But it is still a family favourite, a source of cheap toys on the high street and still the country's biggest seller of CDs and videos. It produces stable cash flow and that will appeal to a financial or trade buyer - but they are the toughest of price negotiators. </p> <p>Either way, the two chains are unlikely to fetch more than about \u00a3900m between them. </p> <p>The City's finest are split on the outlook for the group, which still commands a premium price-to-earnings ratio. Recommendations range from buy to straight sell. </p> <p>It is worth remembering that Sir Geoff is not the sort of retailer the City likes these days. He is not a slick serial retailer, he is not a maverick and his idea of a luxury brand is a B&amp;Q warehouse. He is pushing 60 and has been at Kingfisher since Adam was a lad - 20 years, anyway. </p> <p>But the profits dives at Superdrug and Woolworths reported yesterday show his strategy is right. His decision not to buy the remaining 45% of Castorama in July is also to be applauded. </p> <p>Even if Superdrug and Woolies do bring in less than \u00a31bn, the sum of the parts equates to a share price up to 100p ahead of current levels, not least because the remaining DIY and electricals business could be a bid target.</p>",

But it is hard to see Woolworths as a separately quoted company in the current climate. John Lewis is regarded as a prestige business, while Woolworths is a store that no self-respecting City analyst would be seen dead in and is largely viewed as a ragbag, unfocused chain which does not know its target audience. But it is still a family favourite, a source of cheap toys on the high street and still the country's biggest seller of CDs and videos. It produces stable cash flow and that will appeal to a financial or trade buyer - but they are the toughest of price negotiators. Either way, the two chains are unlikely to fetch more than about \u00a3900m between them. The City's finest are split on the outlook for the group, which still commands a premium price-to-earnings ratio. Recommendations range from buy to straight sell. It is worth remembering that Sir Geoff is not the sort of retailer the City likes these days. He is not a slick serial retailer, he is not a maverick and his idea of a luxury brand is a B&amp;Q warehouse. He is pushing 60 and has been at Kingfisher since Adam was a lad - 20 years, anyway. But the profits dives at Superdrug and Woolworths reported yesterday show his strategy is right. His decision not to buy the remaining 45% of Castorama in July is also to be applauded. Even if Superdrug and Woolies do bring in less than \u00a31bn, the sum of the parts equates to a share price up to 100p ahead of current levels, not least because the remaining DIY and electricals business could be a bid target.",

      "bodyText": "Ciro Citterio, the high street men's fashion chain, last night collapsed into administration with debts of more than \u00a330m. The group, which employs 1,750 staff and has 160 stores across Britain and the Irish republic, was put into administration by the high court to be \"rationalised and restructured\" because of cash flow problems caused by a shareholder dispute. Administrators Gurpal Johal and Simon Freakley of Kroll Buchler Phillips said 27 unprofitable stores would be closed immediately but trading would continue as usual at the other stores for the time being. Mr Johal said it was too early to say if jobs would be lost but staff would be given the opportunity to relocate to other shops where possible. The chain, owned by the Thakrar family, will be ring-fenced from claims by creditors, including \u00a36.9m recently awarded to Kirit Thakrar after a dispute over the valuation of Mr Thakrar's interest in the company. As a result of the judgment some suppliers have reduced or withdrawn their credit limits for the group. Ciro Citterio, based in Birmingham, has grown rapidly over the past few years after it acquired Dunn &amp; Co, Horne Brothers, Oakland and the Sweater Shop. In the past the group has had high-profile sponsorship arrangements with cricket and football clubs, including Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest. Peter Booth, national official for the Transport and General Workers Union, said: \"We are obviously concerned by this turn of events.

      "bodyText": "They are the stock tips of the year. Sell tech. Buy animal labs, woollen mills, diamonds and sewing machine parts. That appears to be the lessons for investors as technology and dot.com stocks crash. As the markets opened for trading yesterday Huntingdon Life Sciences, the animal testing firm, was the unlikely holder of the title of Britain's best performing stock. Its shares have climbed 211% since January 1. The ranking will cause dismay among animal rights activists. However, they will be able to take solace in the fact that Huntingdon's finances remain troubled and the price rise began from a very low base. Of more interest to investors will be the performance of companies like woollen fabric maker Drummond Group, Conroy Diamonds and Gold, and sewing machine parts maker Bogod Group. Shares in all three \"old economy\" firms have more than doubled since the start of the year and dominate a list of best performers which 12 months ago was the exclusive domain of technology related firms. Drummond Group, which has been weaving wool from the same mill at Lumb Lane in Bradford since 1856, has seen its shares climb by 111%. At the other end of the table Claims Direct is the leading laggard. It has fallen 90% since the start of this year following a series of heavily publicised disputes with customers over personal injury claims. Other well known members of the 10 worst performing shares group include former technology favourites InterX, Future Internet, SCI Entertainment and Brainspark. The figures give added credence to the words of legendary American investor Warren Buffett who said at the weekend: \"I will tell you now that we have embraced the 21st century by entering such cutting edge industries as brick, carpet, insulation and paint.\"",

That a medicinal compound diluted out of existence should still exert a therapeutic effect is an affront to conventional biochemistry and pharmacology, based as they are on direct and palpable molecular events. The same goes for a possible explanation of how homoeopathy works: that water somehow retains a \"memory\" of things once dissolved in it. </p> <p>This last notion, famously promoted by French biologist Dr Jacques Benveniste, cost him his laboratories, his funding, and ultimately his international scientific credibility. However, it did not deter Professor Ennis who, being a scientist, was not afraid to try to prove Benveniste wrong. So, more than a decade after Benveniste's excommunication from the scientific mainstream, she jumped at the chance to join a large pan-European research team, hoping finally to lay the Benveniste \"heresy\" to rest. But she was in for a shock: for the team's latest results controversially now suggest that Benveniste might have been right all along. </p> <p>Back in 1985, Benveniste began experimenting with human white blood cells involved in allergic reactions, called basophils. These possess tiny granules containing substances such as histamine, partly responsible for the allergic response. The granules can be stained with a special dye, but they can be decolourised (degranulated) by a substance called anti-immunoglobulin E or aIgE. That much is standard science. What Benveniste claimed so controversially was that he continued to observe basophil degranulation even when the aIgE had been diluted out of existence, but only as long as each dilution step, as with the preparation of homoeopathic remedies, was accompanied by strong agitation. </p> <p>After many experiments, in 1988 Benveniste managed to get an account of his work published in Nature, speculating that the water used in the experiments must have retained a \"memory\" of the original dissolved aIgE. Homoeopaths rejoiced, convinced that here at last was the hard evidence they needed to make homoeopathy scientifically respectable. Celebration was short-lived. Spearheaded by a Nature team that famously included a magician (who could find no fault with Benveniste's methods - only his results), Benveniste was pilloried by the scientific establishment. </p> <p>A British attempt (by scientists at London's University College, published in Nature in 1993) to reproduce Benveniste's findings failed. Benveniste has been striving ever since to get other independent laboratories to repeat his work, claiming that negative findings like those of the British team were the result of misunderstandings of his experimental protocols. Enter Professor Ennis and the pan-European research effort. </p> <p>A consortium of four independent research laboratories in France, Italy, Belgium, and Holland, led by Professor M Roberfroid at Belgium's Catholic University of Louvain in Brussels, used a refinement of Benveniste's original experiment that examined another aspect of basophil activation. The team knew that activation of basophil degranulation by aIgE leads to powerful mediators being released, including large amounts of histamine, which sets up a negative feedback cycle that curbs its own release. So the experiment the pan-European team planned involved comparing inhibition of basophil aIgE-induced degranulation with \"ghost\" dilutions of histamine against control solutions of pure water. </p> <p>In order to make sure no bias was introduced into the experiment by the scientists from the four laboratories involved, they were all \"blinded\" to the contents of their test solutions. In other words, they did not know whether the solutions they were adding to the basophil-aIgE reaction contained ghost amounts of histamine or just pure water. But that's not all. The ghost histamine solutions and the controls were prepared in three different laboratories that had nothing further to do with the trial. </p> <p>The whole experiment was coordinated by an independent researcher who coded all the solutions and collated the data, but was not involved in any of the testing or analysis of the data from the experiment. Not much room, therefore, for fraud or wishful thinking. So the results when they came were a complete surprise. </p> <p>Three of the four labs involved in the trial reported a statistically significant inhibition of the basophil degranulation reaction by the ghost histamine solutions compared with the controls. The fourth lab gave a result that was almost significant, so the total result over all four labs was positive for the ghost histamine solutions. </p> <p>Still, Professor Ennis was not satisfied. \"In this particular trial, we stained the basophils with a dye and then hand-counted those left coloured after the histamine- inhibition reaction. You could argue that human error might enter at this stage.\" So she used a previously developed counting protocol that could be entirely automated. This involved tagging activated basophils with a monoclonal antibody that could be observed via fluorescence and measured by machine. </p> <p>The result, shortly to be published in Inflammation Research, was the same: histamine solutions, both at pharmacological concentrations and diluted out of existence, lead to statistically significant inhibition of basophile activation by aIgE, confirming previous work in this area. </p> <p>\"Despite my reservations against the science of homoeopathy,\" says Ennis, \"the results compel me to suspend my disbelief and to start searching for a rational explanation for our findings.\" She is at pains to point out that the pan-European team have not reproduced Benveniste's findings nor attempted to do so. </p> <p>Jacques Benveniste is unimpressed. \"They've arrived at precisely where we started 12 years ago!\" he says.

      "body": "<p>George Bush's National Missile Defence system loses credibility every time the interceptor missiles fail during tests. But away from the publicity lasers have been making steady progress. Lasers have been destroying test targets for 30 years, but an operational system has always been elusive. Recent advances mean they will soon be fielded, bringing Star Wars right down to earth. </p> <p>The military already use lasers for guidance, such as the laser rangefinder in the Challenger tank and the designators used to mark targets for laser-guided bombs. Even sniper rifles can have laser sights. They are useful because it is easy to put a dot of light on a target - whether the following shell, bomb or bullet hits the same point is another matter. If the laser itself was the weapon a hit would be guaranteed. The challenge is to build a laser powerful enough to do the job. </p> <p>You cannot simply scale up small lasers. Diode lasers such as those used in CD players and barcode scanners only work at low power levels. Gas lasers used in medicine and scientific research are inefficient, converting a small percentage of the power input to laser light and dissipating the rest as waste heat. This is fine if the power level is only a few watts, but impractical for a high-powered weapon. The power consumption would be prohibitive and the laser platform would have to absorb far more heat than the target. </p> <p>Military research has concentrated instead on chemical lasers. The largest system in prospect is the Airborne Laser, a modified Boeing 747 with six chemical oxygen iodine lasers (Coil). The Coil reacts hydrogen peroxide and potassium hydroxide - better known as hair bleach and drain cleaner - with chlorine to produce oxygen molecules in a high energy state. Iodine is added to take up this energy and emit it as laser light. The output from the six lasers is combined into a single beam powerful enough to destroy a ballistic missile hundreds of kilometres away - in theory. </p> <p>The Airborne Laser will not undergo live firing until 2003, but a fleet of eight are already scheduled to be built starting in 2004. </p> <p>There is also the tactical high-energy laser (THEL), a joint US-Israeli development to defend against much smaller missiles. The Lebanese border is often used for rocket attacks on Israel. The rockets are Russian-made Katyushas, originally designed to be fired in salvoes from a launcher mounted on a truck. They are small enough to be man-handled by a single guerrilla and fired from a launch rail improvised from a plank. The Katyusha is barely accurate enough to hit a target the size of a village, but it makes an effective terror weapon, dropping high-explosive warhead up to 20km away. When several are fired together victims have no chance to take cover from the bombardment. </p> <p>The heart of the THEL is a deuterium fluoride laser, reacting heavy hydrogen (deuterium) and fluorine gas together. Hydrogen is notoriously explosive and fluorine is poisonous, and the product, hydrogen fluoride, is highly corrosive. The reaction is energetic enough to produce a laser of useful power. Last June the THEL detected, engaged and destroyed a Katyusha rocket in a test firing. In September the feat was repeated, this time with a salvo of two Katyushas. The THEL currently occupies several trail ers, and the next stage will be a single mobile unit, capable of defending a wide area. </p> <p>Each type of chemical laser emits light of a characteristic wavelength. The Coil's beam is transmitted more effectively in the upper atmosphere, while the THEL works better at sea level. The wavelength also affects how much laser energy is absorbed by the target. A missile painted white may absorb 90% of laser using visible wavelengths, but a shiny aluminium finish is more reflective and will only absorb 2%. An infrared laser has more effect against aluminium (about 35% absorption), but can be reflected by other surfaces. Potential enemies could give their ballistic missiles a coating to reflect the Coil's 1.3 micron laser, and protect Katyushas against the THEL's 3.8 micron beam. </p> <p>The ideal military laser could be tuned to different frequencies according to the target and atmospheric conditions. It would also dispense with the hair bleach, drain cleaner and other inconvenient and expensive chemicals. The free electron laser (FEL) has this capability. In the FEL, electrons are fired into a vacuum, much like a the tube of a television. Unlike a television, the electrons pass through a magnetic array called a wiggler. This causes the electrons to wiggle and emit laser light. Changing the energy of the input and the frequency of the wiggler alters the wavelength of the laser as desired. </p> <p>So far, all the FELs built have been huge, immobile installations. However, the electron source has now been shrunk from the size of a caravan to a microwave oven. The wiggler's giant electromagnets are being replaced with small superconducting magnets. This should eventually result in a laser small enough for Luke Skywalker to carry - but he would still need a thermos of liquid nitrogen to cool the superconductors, and of course an extension lead for the power supply. </p> <p>Some platforms have a power supply built into them. Advocates of the next-generation Joint Strike Fighter, in which British Aerospace is a partner, have pointed out that it would be possible to draw several hundred kilowatts of power direct from the jet engine. </p> <p>By replacing some of the bomb load with a laser, the JSF could become what has been called a \"fotofighter\". The laser would be comparatively low powered, but still capable of burning out any surface-to-air missiles before they got close. This would make the fotofighter virtually immune to ground fire. Air-to-air missiles would be equally useless, and any attempt to get close enough to engage it with cannon or machine guns would be suicidal. The only way of stopping it would be another laser. </p> <p>There is no real need for a fotofighter to be small and agile like the JSF. A laser weapon can easily provide 360 coverage, so a fotofighter would never have to engage in dogfights. And it might not be limited to aerial targets. </p> <p>This brings us to the US Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration programme, which includes a laser mounted on a helicopter or aircraft. The project will focus on \"the feasibility of using laser weapons for military or law enforcement operations in an urban environment\". Laser weapons can be used with literally surgical precision, but it is still a strange choice for a police operation. Armoured vehicles and buildings are not practical targets for laser weapons. However, exposed human skin is much more vulnerable. A high-energy laser would frazzle humans the way a magnifying glass can kill ants. Instantaneous heating could cause flesh to explode with steam. </p> <p>Unlike Star Trek phasers, these lasers cannot be set on stun. As Dr McCoy might have said to Captain Kirk, \"It's law enforcement Jim, but not as we know it.\"</p>",

Laser weapons can be used with literally surgical precision, but it is still a strange choice for a police operation. Armoured vehicles and buildings are not practical targets for laser weapons. However, exposed human skin is much more vulnerable. A high-energy laser would frazzle humans the way a magnifying glass can kill ants. Instantaneous heating could cause flesh to explode with steam. Unlike Star Trek phasers, these lasers cannot be set on stun. As Dr McCoy might have said to Captain Kirk, \"It's law enforcement Jim, but not as we know it.\"",

That would, of course, be grounds for us to contemplate further easing in our monetary stance.\" </p> <p>Mr Plenderleith's remarks came as George Bush and his vice-president, Dick Cheney, expressed concern about the effect on the US economy of the relentless slide in US share prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost more than 300 points by lunchtime in New York yesterday to stand below 10,000 points, while the continued woes of the high technology sector pushed the Nasdaq index below 2000, 60% down on its peak of a year ago. </p> <p>Members of the MPC are closely monitoring events in the financial markets, which were awash yesterday with rumours of Japanese banks going bankrupt, hedge funds being liquidated and more profit warnings from big companies, including Nokia, the Finnish mobile phone giant. </p> <p>Although the bank voted last week to keep rates on hold, Mr Plenderleith's speech to the National Association of Pension Funds investment conference reflects a vigorous debate within the MPC over the future course of UK rates. The governor, Sir Eddie George, said in Basle this week that there were hopeful signs that the US slowdown would not be as bad as originally feared. But other committee members believe that a painful recession in the world's biggest economy will have knock-on effects in the UK and warrants a cut in base rates of 0.5%. </p> <p>At one point yesterday, the FTSE 100 index had lost 250 points, although it later recovered some of the ground to close 94.8 points lower at 5625.9. In a sustained fall, the FTSE has dropped almost 400 points in the last four trading sessions to its lowest level since the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis in late 1998. </p> <p>Ministers believe that so far there has been little impact on the UK economy from falling share prices, which began in the spring of last year. However, one reason for the government's desire to hold the general election in May is concern that the economic outlook will have darkened by the autumn. </p> <p>Mr Plenderleith said yesterday that there was a possibility that the bank could stoke up inflationary pressures by cutting interest rates too aggressively, but made it clear that the bigger risk was of a sharper slowdown than the bank was predicting. </p> <p>White House officials are also becoming alarmed at the prospect that the problems in the US could reinforce the recessionary pressure in the world's second-biggest economy, Japan. \"The downturn here [in the US] feeds the pessimism in Japan,\" one official said, \"because of the negative effect on Japanese exports. And the faster Japan drops, the more it undermines confidence here.\" </p> <p>With Japan already afflicted by both political and economic worries, there were reports yesterday that Daiwa, the country's seventh largest bank, was in serious financial trouble, raising concern that the entire Japanese banking sector was on the edge of a precipice. The rating agency Fitch warned that it might cut its already weak credit ratings for 19 Japanese banks. </p> <p>A senior City source in London explained that a root of the problem for the Japanese banks was the level of the Nikkei, the Japanese equivalent of the FTSE 100. As the Nikkei tumbled, the level of the assets held by Japanese banks to protect them against insolvency also lost their value. Japanese banks are able to hold 45% of these assets as shares, many of which were valued when the Nikkei stood at 40,000. Yesterday it stood at 11,843. </p> <p>Compounding the potential problem are the loans granted by Japanese banks to both individuals and companies which may turn into bad debts if the health of the economy deteriorates. </p> <p>\"The problem is the level of the Nikkei. It's not that surprising that a bank collapse is rumoured,\" said Mark Thomas, banks analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton. </p> <p>In 1998, the strength of the US economy, which accounts for 50% of world demand, hauled the global economy back from the brink of recession. The concern among policymakers in London, Tokyo and New York is that with both the US and Japan in difficulty - and Europe showing signs of slowing - there will be no motor for recovery and that without immediate interest rate cuts there could be a domino effect from country to country.</p>",

But the fascinating thing about Joseph Fiennes's performance in Michael Grandage's production is that it shows us a man, like Richard, educated through suffering. The lower Fiennes falls, the higher he rises spiritually. </p> <p>At first, Fiennes's Edward is recklessly frivolous. He snogs his minion, Piers Gaveston, in front of his blustering barons and treats his wife, Isabella, with casual contempt, airily crying: \"Let her droop and pine.\" His lack of political nous is also shown by the way he allows an aged Bishop to be ducked in the public drains, thereby stirring the church's vengeful wrath. But I've seen other actors, including Derek Jacobi and Ian McKellen, bring out Edward's myopic hedonism more effectively. And, at first, there is something a bit subfusc about Grandage's production: far from being adorned in \"proud fantastic liveries\", James D'Arcy's open-shirted Gaveston would raise few eyebrows at a gay disco, while the hectoring nobles look like motorway-maintenance men. </p> <p>But both Fiennes and the production rise superbly to the spectacle of Edward's decline. Having capered dutifully, Fiennes acquires a specific gravity as his kingdom disintegrates after Gaveston's death. The key moment comes when, having donned a monkish habit, he cries, \"Father, this life contemplative is heaven.\" It's as if he has suddenly awoken to the bliss of introspection. Fiennes's voice also takes on a dry, sardonic quality as, in anticipation of Richard, he mockingly hands over the crown. And, at the last, he becomes a muddied martyr as his imprisoned head, in a vicious echo of the earlier scene, is plunged into the castle sewage. Fiennes's true gift is for inwardness; and, through his graceful stealth, he elevates Marlowe's rhetorical homily into true tragedy. </p> <p>Grandage's production, however, is much more than a one-man show. Fiennes's quality is matched by that of Lloyd Owen, a fast-rising classical actor, as a haughty, excellently spoken Mortimer. So avid is he for power and sex he becomes extremely testy when the cunnilingus he is about to perform on Jo McInnes's enthroned Isabella is needlessly interrupted. Jamie Sives as Lightborne, who kills the king with some peculiarly nasty pokerwork, is also a figure of sinister eroticism; as he straddles the prone king he becomes a strange echo of the more beneficently probing Gaveston. </p> <p>Marlowe's play lacks tonal variety and political subtlety. But Grandage's production avoids boom and bust, is emblematically designed by Christopher Oram so that suspended blue banners tell us when we are in France, and is brilliantly lit by Tim Mitchell, with both diagonal illumination and vertical walls of light. The real triumph, however, lies in the production's discovery in Edward of a tragic hero who acquires majesty only by losing kingship. </p> <p>\u0095 Until March 31. Box office: 0114-249 6000.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Making financial decisions about wills and inheritance tax is something many people tend to put off. Not only is it difficult to think about, but it is also a complicated area. While the following pointers should help you make financial decisions linked to wills and inheritance tax, you should seek professional independent advice if you are dealing with large sums of money.</p> <p>Although it affects relatively few people, about \u00a31.1 billion too much inheritance tax is paid each year, according to research from advisers' body, IFA Promotion. The recent report revealed an estimated 1.1 million people would share inheritances of about \u00a325 billion, with about \u00a31.4 billion going to the tax office.But it is estimated much of this could be avoided.</p> <p>The report also says about 53,000 people will die \"intestate\", meaning without having made a will. If you have no living relatives, or these cannot be traced, the money will go to the government.</p> <p><strong> GUIDE TO WILLS </strong></p> <p><strong> Who can make a will? </strong></p> <p>Anyone aged over 18.</p> <p><strong> Why should you make a will? </strong></p> <p>A will lets those left behind know how you want your assets distributed. You need to make a will so you can ensure that your estate - which includes property, savings and possessions - is handed down to the beneficiaries of your choice. </p> <p>If you die without making a will, there could be unpleasant legal wrangles and any money or property will be distributed according to the laws of intestacy. This does not recognise unmarried partners and, what's more, in cases of large legacies, a spouse does not automatically inherit everything.</p> <p><strong> How to make a will </strong></p> <p>Many people see a solicitor to make a will. This will mean you benefit from experience. But a consultation costs - typically about \u00a360 for a 15-minute consultation, which should be enough time, in most cases, to get the job done. Some banks also offer help with making a will.</p> <p><strong> Can you do it yourself? </strong></p> <p>Yes, kits for writing wills are available from shops such as WH Smith for about \u00a36. You can also do an online will at www.moneyextra.com (look for the Will Wizard section).</p> <p><strong> Who else needs to be involved? </strong></p> <p>You will need to appoint executors, who are, typically, family members or lawyers. A will needs to be witnessed by two people who are not beneficiaries.</p> <p><strong> How often should a will be updated? </strong></p> <p>As your circumstances change, your will may need to be updated or altered. For example, if you marry and have children you may need to consider that, if you have children under 18, money should be left in trust for them.</p> <p><strong> Where should a will be kept? </strong></p> <p>A will should be viewed as a valuable item and be kept in a safe place, such as a bank safe deposit box. Copies are worthless and you should be aware of this if you ever need to send a will in the post, as only the original is recognised legally.</p> <p><strong> GUIDE TO INHERITANCE TAX </strong></p> <p>There are three main taxes that affect most people: income, capital gains and inheritance. The good news is that most people don't pay inheritance tax and the Inland Revenue says that 96% of estates avoid it. But it is an area that is now concerning far more people. </p> <p>Graham Collins, a financial planner with inheritance tax specialists Advisory &amp; Brokerage, says this is largely because of rising property prices. Many people, particularly in the south of England, now own valuable homes, and their total assets exceed the inheritance tax threshold. </p> <p>Many people do manage to avoid inheritance tax, however, either through good planning or through leaving assets to their spouse (which means it is not payable).</p> <p><strong> What if I leave everything to my husband or wife? </strong></p> <p>No inheritance tax is payable, but you must both be domiciled in the UK.</p> <p><strong> What's the inheritance tax threshold? </strong></p> <p>This is \u00a3244,000 and, if you are liable for the tax, it will be levied at 40%. The sum-up to \u00a3244,000 is known as the nil-rate band.</p> <p><strong> What deductions are made? </strong></p> <p>Bequests to a spouse and UK charities are exempt, and outstanding bills, together with funeral costs, will also be deducted from the inheritance tax amount outstanding. </p> <p><strong> Who pays the tax office? </strong></p> <p>This will be paid by personal representatives - typically, any children. In some cases, children or heirs can find themselves having to pay the tax bill out of their own funds. Some people find themselves forced to take out bridging loans to meet tax liabilities because they are in the process of disposing of assets, which is why planning before you die can be very helpful.</p> <p><strong> When is money owed for inheritance tax payable? </strong></p> <p>It needs to be paid six months after the end of the month when the person has died. The authority to release the money held in the estate is known as probate in England and Wales and confirmation in Scotland.</p> <p><strong> How can I avoid paying inheritance tax through gifts? </strong></p> <p>The crucial issue with making gifts to below the inheritance threshold is that they are made seven years before you die - it is, in a sense, a clock ticking when you can beat the tax office. </p> <p><strong> What are the rules concerning gifts? </strong></p> <p>Although gifts made in the seven years before your death can be subject to inheritance tax, a number are exempt from tax. A list of these can be found in An Introduction to Inheritance Tax, a leaflet available from the Inland Revenue. These gifts include: sums of money of up to \u00a35,000 given as wedding gifts to children; maintenance payments to ex-partners and children; and other gifts of up to \u00a33,000 made during a tax year. </p> <p>Everyone has this \u00a33,000 limit and, if it's not used up in one year, the amount can be carried forward to the next. After three years, the tax payable on a gift starts reducing until it reaches nil at year seven. Small gifts of up to \u00a3250 can be made to any number of people. This is known as taper relief.</p> <p>The situation concerning gifts can be complicated and, again, it is an area where many people will want to seek advice from an experienced financial adviser. </p> <p><strong> What are \"potentially exempt transfers\"? </strong></p> <p>It is just another term used for gifts made within the seven-year period to friends and relatives. If you die within the seven years, the value is added to your estate; if you don't, then the gift is exempt. You do not have to tell the tax office about gifts you have made, but the recipient is required to report the gift within a year of the donor's death. </p> <p>If the death is within three years, 40% is charged; after this, a sliding scale is applied. This is equivalent to a reduction of a fifth if the gift was made between three and four years before your death; another fifth if between four and five years; and so on, until the seventh year. </p> <p><strong> What are chargeable transfers? </strong></p> <p>Although there is no inheritance tax charged on a gift made seven years before you die, chargeable transfers can incur tax. These are sums of money transferred typically to trusts for which tax payable at 20% is normally levied on the excess above \u00a3234,000. </p> <p>These can also be known as discretionary trusts, which are administered by trustees and where the individual may have no immediate right to income. Gifts to companies are also known as chargeable transfers.</p> <p><strong> What about giving away a property? </strong></p> <p>Giving away your home to children or relatives will not mean you are automatically exempt from inheritance tax. If you plan to keep living in it, you need to prove you are paying the new landlord the correct market rent. The landlord could also face a capital gain tax bill when the property is sold and the inheritance tax sum owned if you die within seven years of making the gift.</p> <p><strong> What about insurance policies? </strong> Many people have life insurance and if you die and the proceeds are paid into your estate, this money could be subject to inheritance tax if it exceeds the \u00a3234,000 limit. The way around this is to have the policy within a trust. Pension fund proceeds passed on to a spouse will also be free of tax.</p> <p><strong> What about gifts to charity? </strong></p> <p>Anything left to a UK charity is free of inheritance tax and this also applies to political parties and housing associations.</p> <p><strong> What about a trust to avoid inheritance tax? </strong> Trusts are a good way of avoiding or paying less inheritance tax and a financial adviser can assist with setting these up. They are not necessarily a total escape from tax though - dependants may still face a tax bill, although at a far lower rate than 20%.</p> <p>Financial products are held within trusts and are typically provided by insurance companies. It is worth noting that some have higher charges than others.</p> <p>You will need advice on how to set these up. Graham Collins of Advisory &amp; Brokerage says: \"These are best viewed as a way of giving away ownership of money, but still retaining some measure of control.\"</p> <p>If you do not set up a trust, although you can transfer assets to a spouse tax-free, when they die and pass on wealth to the next generation, inheritance tax will be payable on everything beyond their \u00a3234,000 limit. </p> <p>Life insurance can be written in trust. This applies mainly to whole of life policies. In the case of married couples, for example, a policy would be written on both lives, which pays a death benefit on the second death - when inheritance tax would arise.</p> <p>You can also buy a policy called a \"gift inter vivos\" - meaning a gift between two living people - which is also written within a trust.

      "bodyText": "Making financial decisions about wills and inheritance tax is something many people tend to put off. Not only is it difficult to think about, but it is also a complicated area. While the following pointers should help you make financial decisions linked to wills and inheritance tax, you should seek professional independent advice if you are dealing with large sums of money. Although it affects relatively few people, about \u00a31.1 billion too much inheritance tax is paid each year, according to research from advisers' body, IFA Promotion. The recent report revealed an estimated 1.1 million people would share inheritances of about \u00a325 billion, with about \u00a31.4 billion going to the tax office.But it is estimated much of this could be avoided. The report also says about 53,000 people will die \"intestate\", meaning without having made a will. If you have no living relatives, or these cannot be traced, the money will go to the government. GUIDE TO WILLS Who can make a will? Anyone aged over 18. Why should you make a will? A will lets those left behind know how you want your assets distributed. You need to make a will so you can ensure that your estate - which includes property, savings and possessions - is handed down to the beneficiaries of your choice. If you die without making a will, there could be unpleasant legal wrangles and any money or property will be distributed according to the laws of intestacy. This does not recognise unmarried partners and, what's more, in cases of large legacies, a spouse does not automatically inherit everything. How to make a will Many people see a solicitor to make a will. This will mean you benefit from experience. But a consultation costs - typically about \u00a360 for a 15-minute consultation, which should be enough time, in most cases, to get the job done. Some banks also offer help with making a will. Can you do it yourself? Yes, kits for writing wills are available from shops such as WH Smith for about \u00a36. You can also do an online will at www.moneyextra.com (look for the Will Wizard section). Who else needs to be involved? You will need to appoint executors, who are, typically, family members or lawyers. A will needs to be witnessed by two people who are not beneficiaries. How often should a will be updated? As your circumstances change, your will may need to be updated or altered. For example, if you marry and have children you may need to consider that, if you have children under 18, money should be left in trust for them. Where should a will be kept? A will should be viewed as a valuable item and be kept in a safe place, such as a bank safe deposit box. Copies are worthless and you should be aware of this if you ever need to send a will in the post, as only the original is recognised legally. GUIDE TO INHERITANCE TAX There are three main taxes that affect most people: income, capital gains and inheritance. The good news is that most people don't pay inheritance tax and the Inland Revenue says that 96% of estates avoid it. But it is an area that is now concerning far more people. Graham Collins, a financial planner with inheritance tax specialists Advisory &amp; Brokerage, says this is largely because of rising property prices. Many people, particularly in the south of England, now own valuable homes, and their total assets exceed the inheritance tax threshold. Many people do manage to avoid inheritance tax, however, either through good planning or through leaving assets to their spouse (which means it is not payable). What if I leave everything to my husband or wife? No inheritance tax is payable, but you must both be domiciled in the UK. What's the inheritance tax threshold? This is \u00a3244,000 and, if you are liable for the tax, it will be levied at 40%. The sum-up to \u00a3244,000 is known as the nil-rate band. What deductions are made? Bequests to a spouse and UK charities are exempt, and outstanding bills, together with funeral costs, will also be deducted from the inheritance tax amount outstanding. Who pays the tax office? This will be paid by personal representatives - typically, any children. In some cases, children or heirs can find themselves having to pay the tax bill out of their own funds. Some people find themselves forced to take out bridging loans to meet tax liabilities because they are in the process of disposing of assets, which is why planning before you die can be very helpful. When is money owed for inheritance tax payable? It needs to be paid six months after the end of the month when the person has died. The authority to release the money held in the estate is known as probate in England and Wales and confirmation in Scotland. How can I avoid paying inheritance tax through gifts? The crucial issue with making gifts to below the inheritance threshold is that they are made seven years before you die - it is, in a sense, a clock ticking when you can beat the tax office. What are the rules concerning gifts? Although gifts made in the seven years before your death can be subject to inheritance tax, a number are exempt from tax. A list of these can be found in An Introduction to Inheritance Tax, a leaflet available from the Inland Revenue. These gifts include: sums of money of up to \u00a35,000 given as wedding gifts to children; maintenance payments to ex-partners and children; and other gifts of up to \u00a33,000 made during a tax year. Everyone has this \u00a33,000 limit and, if it's not used up in one year, the amount can be carried forward to the next. After three years, the tax payable on a gift starts reducing until it reaches nil at year seven. Small gifts of up to \u00a3250 can be made to any number of people. This is known as taper relief. The situation concerning gifts can be complicated and, again, it is an area where many people will want to seek advice from an experienced financial adviser. What are \"potentially exempt transfers\"? It is just another term used for gifts made within the seven-year period to friends and relatives. If you die within the seven years, the value is added to your estate; if you don't, then the gift is exempt. You do not have to tell the tax office about gifts you have made, but the recipient is required to report the gift within a year of the donor's death. If the death is within three years, 40% is charged; after this, a sliding scale is applied. This is equivalent to a reduction of a fifth if the gift was made between three and four years before your death; another fifth if between four and five years; and so on, until the seventh year. What are chargeable transfers? Although there is no inheritance tax charged on a gift made seven years before you die, chargeable transfers can incur tax. These are sums of money transferred typically to trusts for which tax payable at 20% is normally levied on the excess above \u00a3234,000. These can also be known as discretionary trusts, which are administered by trustees and where the individual may have no immediate right to income. Gifts to companies are also known as chargeable transfers. What about giving away a property? Giving away your home to children or relatives will not mean you are automatically exempt from inheritance tax. If you plan to keep living in it, you need to prove you are paying the new landlord the correct market rent. The landlord could also face a capital gain tax bill when the property is sold and the inheritance tax sum owned if you die within seven years of making the gift. What about insurance policies? Many people have life insurance and if you die and the proceeds are paid into your estate, this money could be subject to inheritance tax if it exceeds the \u00a3234,000 limit. The way around this is to have the policy within a trust. Pension fund proceeds passed on to a spouse will also be free of tax. What about gifts to charity? Anything left to a UK charity is free of inheritance tax and this also applies to political parties and housing associations. What about a trust to avoid inheritance tax? Trusts are a good way of avoiding or paying less inheritance tax and a financial adviser can assist with setting these up. They are not necessarily a total escape from tax though - dependants may still face a tax bill, although at a far lower rate than 20%. Financial products are held within trusts and are typically provided by insurance companies. It is worth noting that some have higher charges than others. You will need advice on how to set these up. Graham Collins of Advisory &amp; Brokerage says: \"These are best viewed as a way of giving away ownership of money, but still retaining some measure of control.\" If you do not set up a trust, although you can transfer assets to a spouse tax-free, when they die and pass on wealth to the next generation, inheritance tax will be payable on everything beyond their \u00a3234,000 limit. Life insurance can be written in trust. This applies mainly to whole of life policies. In the case of married couples, for example, a policy would be written on both lives, which pays a death benefit on the second death - when inheritance tax would arise. You can also buy a policy called a \"gift inter vivos\" - meaning a gift between two living people - which is also written within a trust. This is a temporary type of cover, aimed at meeting an inheritance tax liable if you die within seven years of making a lifetime gift. The death benefit will reduce as the potential tax liability reduces. LIVING ABROAD AND INHERITANCE TAX A growing number of older people choose to retire in the sun, for example by moving to Spain or Cyprus. But some people mistakenly believe they have escaped the clutches of the Inland Revenue by moving abroad. Although this means they no longer have to pay income or capital gains tax, they remain liable for inheritance tax. Graham Collins of Advisory &amp; Brokerage says many people fail to understand the implications of going abroad. \"Just because you change your residence, it does not mean you change your domicile, which, in the case of many people, remains the UK.\" He explains that the domicile, as opposed to residence, concept is harder to define and is linked to \"ultimate association\". In some cases, it is possible to change your domicile and so avoid tax, but this is rare. Added to this, many people return to the UK before they die. If you are considering moving abroad, you should seek advice without delay on how to tackle potential inheritance tax problems. Insurance company Scottish Equitable International, which operates financial planning solutions such as offshore bonds held in trust, says thousands of people store up inheritance tax problems by moving abroad and dying there. It claims that some people could face a double whammy in tax bills - a charge from the UK and the European country where they were living. This does not apply to those who die in the UK. Married women and property Every year there are cases where husbands die and the wife presumes the property will automatically pass to her. But this only happens automatically if a property is registered in both names. With older people, particularly, a home can be registered only in the name of the husband. If this is the case, there needs to be a grant of probate to dispose of the property and it then needs to be re-registered in the name of the surviving spouse. This needs to be done with the Land Registry, takes several months and also incurs a cost. If you are a married woman and have been living in a property for many years, it is worth checking you are registered as a joint owner. An unmarried woman living with a man may have no right to a property if no will is made and she is not a joint owner. CHECKLIST TO HELP WITH WILLS AND INHERITANCE TAX \u0095 Work out the full value of your assets so you can plan how to avoid inheritance tax in plenty of time. \u0095 Make a will.

But they return after the interval to give us the full Royston Vasey experience, complete with grotesque make-up and outfits, innumerable set changes, thunderflashes and dry ice. This is what the audience has been waiting for: Potts and Tubbs, Herr Lipp, Pauline, toad-obsessives Val and Harvey Denton, Babs the transsexual cab-driver, failed rock star Les McQueen, and Dr Chinnery, the deadly vet, here pulling the head off a rabbit in a failed magic trick. The crowd are so fired up by the chance to see live TV stars that they'd laugh at any old rubbish, and it's to the League's credit that they barely slacken. Pemberton does have a tendency to play to the audience, a smug little simper on his chops. But then, as Herr Lipp might say, sometimes you have the right to feel a little cocky. \u0095 Until April 7.
