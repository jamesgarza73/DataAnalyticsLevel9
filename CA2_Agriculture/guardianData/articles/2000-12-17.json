      "bodyText": "Downtrodden males are set to get a new champion. Plans are being drawn up to scrap Whitehall's Women's Unit and replace it with a new organisation that represents both males and females who are discriminated against because of their sex. Among names being considered for the new body are the Citizens' Unit or the Equal Opportunities Unit. The change of role for the Government's flagship of feminism follows a growing debate about how males are being left behind in certain areas. But the plans to change direction, being drawn up by key Ministers and Number 10, have angered some women's groups who fear the policymaking unit's radicalism could be watered down after the election. However, the two Women's Ministers, Baroness Jay and Tessa Jowell, argue that the 'new feminism' should be worried about inequalities affecting either sex. The unit of civil servants has been the driving force behind policies on issues from child care and equal pay to domestic violence and teenage anorexia. It gives Whitehall back-up to Jay and Jowell: changing it would raise questions over whether their roles would survive. Under the proposals for Labour's second term, the unit would still work on injustices against females, but would also examine why boys underperform in exams and are more likely to be expelled from school, or how to reduce persistent unemployment of men over the age of 50. 'The debate has moved on,' said a senior government source. 'Surely it is as important that boys are underachieving at school as it is that more teenage girls are taking up smoking, for example?' The move - following the example of the Equal Opportunities Commission, which handles as many sex discrimination complaints from men as from women - provoked sharp criticism from some women's groups. 'The Women's Unit has done a really, really crucial job and the sad thing is it hasn't got the credit,' said Mary Ann Stephenson of the women's think tank the Fawcett Society. 'The reason we need a Women's Unit is because most policy is based around assumptions that are based on men's lives, from working patterns to relationships. 'I know people look at the Women's Unit and say \"it's not fair, what about a Men's Unit\", but the point is that without it we would have policy that didn't necessarily take account of women -women are poorer than men, they have less political power.' Men's groups have long called for action to tackle the growing crisis of masculinity. Young men are twice as likely as the average person to be victims of violent crime - and teenage boys are three times as likely as any other group to commit it. British men work the longest hours in Europe, and male life expectancy is five years less than women's. The militant men's movement argues, however, that only an all-male unit could solve men's problems. 'This would be like putting the courts in the hands of the thieves,' said Robert Whiston of pressure group Mankind.

And now, as his seventieth birthday looms, he is planning the richest auction of cricketing memorabilia ever.</p> <p>The Trueman collection is to be auctioned during his birthday dinner at London's Grosvenor House Hotel on 6 February - both on the floor of the dining room and over the internet - and threatens to reach as much as \u00a3800,000.</p> <p>The existing record stands at \u00a3296,000, raised in 1995 when Hal Cohen's cricket collection went under the hammer of Phillips auctioneers. Trueman, a national institution both as a player and for more than 20 years as a member of the BBC Test Match Special team, has decided his huge collection represents a security dilemma.</p> <p>His secluded home close to Skipton, North Yorkshire, has been burgled once and the vast majority of his collection is now in a bank. He would rather see it distributed to collectors, apart from some keepsakes for his children and grandchildren.</p> <p>'I've been told my complete collection could be worth up to \u00a3800,000. Most of it is going, although I am hanging on to some pieces,' he said. 'I never see most of the collection - we live in troubled times. I don't want my wife, Veronica, endangered when I'm not at home, and so most of it is already kept away from the house. What's the point of keeping it under lock and key? I've decided to let it go.'</p> <p>Most interest is likely to be focused on the ball with which Trueman took his historic 300th Test wicket in 1964 against the Australians: Neil Hawke was the victim when Colin Cowdrey, who died earlier this month, took the catch at first slip.</p> <p>Trueman, a former cricket columnist for the Sunday People who now contributes to The Observer , said: 'My old Sunday People editor said \"Can you do it on Saturday? I want the 300th wicket\", and luckily we batted first and so I managed to do it on the Saturday! The editor said he would buy me a case of champagne.

      "bodyText": "Frederick Sewards Trueman OBE is fond of a landmark. The first cricketer to take 250 Test wickets. The first to break the seemingly impossible 300-wicket barrier. And now, as his seventieth birthday looms, he is planning the richest auction of cricketing memorabilia ever. The Trueman collection is to be auctioned during his birthday dinner at London's Grosvenor House Hotel on 6 February - both on the floor of the dining room and over the internet - and threatens to reach as much as \u00a3800,000. The existing record stands at \u00a3296,000, raised in 1995 when Hal Cohen's cricket collection went under the hammer of Phillips auctioneers. Trueman, a national institution both as a player and for more than 20 years as a member of the BBC Test Match Special team, has decided his huge collection represents a security dilemma. His secluded home close to Skipton, North Yorkshire, has been burgled once and the vast majority of his collection is now in a bank. He would rather see it distributed to collectors, apart from some keepsakes for his children and grandchildren. 'I've been told my complete collection could be worth up to \u00a3800,000. Most of it is going, although I am hanging on to some pieces,' he said. 'I never see most of the collection - we live in troubled times. I don't want my wife, Veronica, endangered when I'm not at home, and so most of it is already kept away from the house. What's the point of keeping it under lock and key? I've decided to let it go.' Most interest is likely to be focused on the ball with which Trueman took his historic 300th Test wicket in 1964 against the Australians: Neil Hawke was the victim when Colin Cowdrey, who died earlier this month, took the catch at first slip. Trueman, a former cricket columnist for the Sunday People who now contributes to The Observer , said: 'My old Sunday People editor said \"Can you do it on Saturday? I want the 300th wicket\", and luckily we batted first and so I managed to do it on the Saturday! The editor said he would buy me a case of champagne. A memorable game and this is the very ball that claimed that landmark wicket.' There are also the balls with which he overtook Brian Statham as the world's leading Test wicket taker - with his 243rd wicket in the 1963 Christchurch Test against New Zealand - and took his 250th Test wicket in the same series. There are numerous historic bats featuring the signatures of cricketing greats such as Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Leonard Hutton, Ray Lindwall, Neil Harvey, Brian Statham, Ian Botham, Sir Garfield Sobers, Trevor Bailey, Colin Cowdrey, Ted Dexter, Brian Close, Sir Richard Hadlee, Denis Compton, Geoffrey Boycott, the Bedser twins and many others. Books, paintings, cricketing clothing and silverware are also included. So too are the boots Trueman was wearing at The Oval when he trapped Hawke to take that 300th wicket. Naturally, they are now signed by him. This celebrated footwear was painted by the well-known Yorkshire artist John Blakey and 300 prints will be on offer, as will an original Blakey portrait of the cricketer depicting him some years after he finished playing the game. Cricket attracts greater interest in memorabilia among collectors than almost any other sport. Trueman's close friend Sir John Paul Getty junior is a keen collector, although the reclusive philanthropist is in poor health . Perhaps he will be tempted by online bidding. 'He could be interested,' said Trueman. 'I will ensure Sir Paul and Lady Getty are invited. He is a lovely man and a good friend, but I don't know if he will be well enough to show any interest. As for Mick Jagger, we know he loves the game, but who knows? He will be invited to the dinner, I'm sure of that.' Many of Trueman's old cricket chums will be there too, and invitations are likely to land on the doormats of cricket buff Sir Tim Rice, present and past Prime Ministers Tony Blair and John Major; former Labour sport spokesman Tom Pendry MP and other cricketing dignitaries. Trueman has in the past campaigned for action to help old cricketers who hit hard times and ironically helped organise a fund-raising dinner at the same London hotel 12 years ago for his friend and England bowling partner Brian Statham, who died ear lier this year. 'The proceeds from the auction will be invested wisely for myself and my family,' he said. 'I have three grandsons and two granddaughters and another grandchild on the way. I remember the dinner we had for Brian and I am so so sad that neither he nor Colin Cowdrey will be with me for my night in February.' The limited run of Blakey's '300-wicket boots' prints was due to be launched last week with Lord Cowdrey counter-signing them. Cowdrey, of course, was the man Trueman had to thank for catching out Hawke. Sadly, Cowdrey's death meant such matters were postponed. 'That was terribly sad,' said Trueman. 'But now Colin's son Chris has stepped in to carry out the auction in February at the Grosvenor House. It's very, very good of him.' What am I bid?

Without it I think I would be dead,' the quiet 15-year-old said as she picked at the chipped silver varnish on her fingernails. </p> <p>She is not exaggerating. Suzanne's life has been an unrelenting litany of suffering as she grew up on one of Peckham's toughest estates amid the drugs and the violence that blight so many lives in this deprived area of south London. </p> <p>Both her parents are heroin addicts, and by the age of 12 Suzanne had already dropped out of school to look after her three siblings, sometimes being forced to scavenge for food in bins. Her father is in jail and her mother is still on drugs. Suzanne lives in a care home but now knows what it means to have a future. </p> <p>Kids Co provided her with education courses, people to talk to and a job. She works as a classroom assistant in a local primary school and wants to become a teacher. 'I love it here. I come every day,' she said. At first glance the row of converted railway arches tucked under a busy commuter line seem an unlikely beacon of hope. Though the murder of Damilola Taylor just a mile away threw a media spotlight on the area's problems, Kids Co had already been here for years, battling with the conditions that bred such an awful crime. </p> <p>Employing 25 full-time staff, the centre, known locally as 'The Arches', sends teams into schools to provide support to troubled teenagers. It reaches 4,000 children, including 200 who visit. The centre provides hot meals, education, blankets or a listening ear for children and teenagers on the nearby estates. </p> <p>Almost 90 per cent of those who come to The Arches have been involved in crime: robbery, drug dealing, rape. Instead of condemning, Kids Co workers look into the children's backgrounds for reasons for their behaviour. Many of those coming to the centre have suppressed their emotions. At first they come across as cold, ruthless and uncaring. But through projects run at The Arches, including seemingly trivial activities such as art classes, they begin to express themselves. </p> <p>Kids Co was formed as a schools project in 1995 by psychotherapist Camila Batmanghelidjh. A year later she used her mortgage repayments to buy The Arches and convert it. Within days a group of about 100 youths, many carrying knives, began to destroy the place and abuse the staff. For Batmanghelidjh it was a pivotal moment. </p> <p>'We were faced with these kids doing all these terrible things and I was horrified. But then I thought I can either give up or I can try and work with them,' she said. </p> <p>She decided to stick it out. Enduring the barrage of insults and violence, Batmanghelidjh and her staff persevered and bit by bit Kids Co won the youths' respect. </p> <p>'Eventually some of them would come up to us and ask us \"Why don't you hit us back? Yesterday I called you all those names and you still talk to me today.\" They began to be impressed,' Batmanghelidjh said. </p> <p>Once the children begin to discuss their experiences, Kids Co advises them away from the drug gangs and criminal activities on whose fringes they exist. And it works. Scores of children have abandoned crime after visiting The Arches. For Batmanghelidjh, it was fulfilment of a life's dream. A Belgian-Iranian refugee, she had always wanted to work with children. </p> <p>Most of the stories that emerge from the slums and dilapidated tower blocks are horrific. Sex abuse is common, many of the girls are involved in prostitution while the boys get sucked into dealing drugs. </p> <p>So popular is the charity that the children are now fiercely loyal. Only a few weeks ago a gunman, not connected to the charity, tried to enter the centre. His target was local youths there, but other children and staff disarmed him and he fled. </p> <p>The police were called, but as officers questioned staff a note was handed into the centre. It was from local criminal youths and stated simply that the man had been caught and would be dealt with for threatening the charity. In short, he would be killed. </p> <p>Batmanghelidjh wrote a frantic note back begging them not to hurt him and instead turn him over to the police - something unthinkable in London gang culture. But later that night the miraculous happened. The man was left at a police station.

Inside, as the jet-lag kicked in, I uncorked a nice South Australian Sauvignon and sat down, numb and fuggy, with my mother to watch the last edition in the first series of Australia's Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? </p> <p>It's not as if there aren't better things to do on a balmy, early summer even-ing in the Aussie bush - a bracing 20-minute drive along dirt roads to the nearest pub, a blood-chilling confrontation with an arachnid as big as your hand (that came later in the evening, as it happens. And the next evening. And, indeed, the evening after that) or reciting the collected works of Banjo Patterson, for example - but my mother, like most other Australians, had recently been gripped by Millionaire fever so we stayed in and watched a nice young man called Miles from Canberra attempt to pay off his student debts by answering the Aus$16,000-question: what is the date of the Queen's real, as opposed to 'official', birthday? </p> <p>This was, I thought, a pretty difficult question for a 22-year-old trying to win 16,000 bucks (and given the exchange rate, barely worth getting out of bed for over here) - and its inclusion probably proof that Australia isn't quite as close to becoming a republic as one might have hoped. Extraordinarily, however, Miles got it right. Later, he said he wanted to send his mum on a cruise, but he couldn't have travelled abroad recently or he would have known that he might just be able to afford to send her off with a packet of crisps and can of Coca-Cola for an afternoon on a Sydney Explorer ferry. </p> <p>It's not - pout, stamp! - fair. You watch mind-altering amounts of TV for 46 weeks of the year before getting on a plane to the other side of the earth and then, at roughly the moment Miles decides the Queen's real birthday probably falls four days before Anzac Day ('and I think she'd moved it, so it wouldn't conflict', which sweetly parochial logic made me snort with laughter before it turned out to be correct), Britain was waking up to the news that it finally had a Millionaire winner. I found out a week later and felt cheated in much the same way I had after spending all day on a plane in May 1997 and arriving home to a different government (though, admittedly, I'd had a bit of warning). </p> <p> There are now so few collective TV moments to be savoured that if you miss one of the really big ones - Diana's funeral, say, or an election or live action featuring Judy Finnegan's breasts - you feel slightly disenfranchised. But if you watch TV for a living, you feel like a complete fraud. </p> <p>So this week, numb and fuggy with jet-lag again, I determined to miss as little as possible. Steve Redgrave winning <strong>Sports Personality of the Year</strong> ? Nasty Nick Bateman's debut as a quiz host (<strong>Trust Me</strong>)? Scary Spice throwing open the very many doors of her lovely manor house (<strong>Mel B - The Players Club</strong>)? Please prise open my eyelids and insert matchsticks: if Steve was going to blub, Nick turned out to be the new Anne Robinson and Scary revealed to be an authority on European monetary union - even if it meant looking like The Grinch , I was going to be there to witness it. But of course there were no surprises: Steve didn't cry, and (deplorably) also failed to thank the missus, Scary sounded uncannily like Fay Ripley's Jenny from Cold Feet and Nasty Nick was only slightly nastyish. And even the 'news' footage of William of Staines cleaning the loo and saying 'Big-Up!' just looked like the sensible first step in a career that, when the Guardian has got its way, will probably culminate in him hosting his own campy, late-night C4 chat show while Dad busies himself ruling Australia. </p> <p>Under strictly monitored conditions - a living-room laboratory briefly sealed off from access to caffeine and cigarettes - I conducted a rigorous medical test: for how long could the jet-lagged viewer focus on Amanda Burton moving very, very slowly around a brace of very old, very dead bodies without succumbing to the come-hither wink of the Sandman? The result: 17 minutes. Having decided that this probably wasn't fair to Amanda, who was, after all, only doing her job, albeit so slowly that she appeared likely to catch rigor mortis, the following day I tried to watch <strong>Silent Witness</strong> again. </p> <p>Nothing wrong with the plot - Andrew Sachs as a Holocaust survivor taking revenge on the Auschwitz doctor who had tortured him and killed his twin brother - but Burton's Professor Ryan is so devoid of character and emotions that her own autopsy would reveal only a small, slightly corroded tin heart attached to an Intel Pentium processor.

      "bodyText": "Sports Personality of the Year BBC1 Trust Me C4 Mel B - The Players Club BBC2 Silent Witness BBC1 Cutting Edge C4 Friends C4 Outside in the bush, the sun had set streakily over New South Wales's Monaro region, glittery Venus had risen, a flock of galahs had colonised the garden's biggest gum tree for the night and the dogs were having a post-prandial tussle on the veranda. Inside, as the jet-lag kicked in, I uncorked a nice South Australian Sauvignon and sat down, numb and fuggy, with my mother to watch the last edition in the first series of Australia's Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? It's not as if there aren't better things to do on a balmy, early summer even-ing in the Aussie bush - a bracing 20-minute drive along dirt roads to the nearest pub, a blood-chilling confrontation with an arachnid as big as your hand (that came later in the evening, as it happens. And the next evening. And, indeed, the evening after that) or reciting the collected works of Banjo Patterson, for example - but my mother, like most other Australians, had recently been gripped by Millionaire fever so we stayed in and watched a nice young man called Miles from Canberra attempt to pay off his student debts by answering the Aus$16,000-question: what is the date of the Queen's real, as opposed to 'official', birthday? This was, I thought, a pretty difficult question for a 22-year-old trying to win 16,000 bucks (and given the exchange rate, barely worth getting out of bed for over here) - and its inclusion probably proof that Australia isn't quite as close to becoming a republic as one might have hoped. Extraordinarily, however, Miles got it right. Later, he said he wanted to send his mum on a cruise, but he couldn't have travelled abroad recently or he would have known that he might just be able to afford to send her off with a packet of crisps and can of Coca-Cola for an afternoon on a Sydney Explorer ferry. It's not - pout, stamp! - fair. You watch mind-altering amounts of TV for 46 weeks of the year before getting on a plane to the other side of the earth and then, at roughly the moment Miles decides the Queen's real birthday probably falls four days before Anzac Day ('and I think she'd moved it, so it wouldn't conflict', which sweetly parochial logic made me snort with laughter before it turned out to be correct), Britain was waking up to the news that it finally had a Millionaire winner. I found out a week later and felt cheated in much the same way I had after spending all day on a plane in May 1997 and arriving home to a different government (though, admittedly, I'd had a bit of warning). There are now so few collective TV moments to be savoured that if you miss one of the really big ones - Diana's funeral, say, or an election or live action featuring Judy Finnegan's breasts - you feel slightly disenfranchised. But if you watch TV for a living, you feel like a complete fraud. So this week, numb and fuggy with jet-lag again, I determined to miss as little as possible. Steve Redgrave winning Sports Personality of the Year ? Nasty Nick Bateman's debut as a quiz host (Trust Me)? Scary Spice throwing open the very many doors of her lovely manor house (Mel B - The Players Club)? Please prise open my eyelids and insert matchsticks: if Steve was going to blub, Nick turned out to be the new Anne Robinson and Scary revealed to be an authority on European monetary union - even if it meant looking like The Grinch , I was going to be there to witness it. But of course there were no surprises: Steve didn't cry, and (deplorably) also failed to thank the missus, Scary sounded uncannily like Fay Ripley's Jenny from Cold Feet and Nasty Nick was only slightly nastyish. And even the 'news' footage of William of Staines cleaning the loo and saying 'Big-Up!' just looked like the sensible first step in a career that, when the Guardian has got its way, will probably culminate in him hosting his own campy, late-night C4 chat show while Dad busies himself ruling Australia. Under strictly monitored conditions - a living-room laboratory briefly sealed off from access to caffeine and cigarettes - I conducted a rigorous medical test: for how long could the jet-lagged viewer focus on Amanda Burton moving very, very slowly around a brace of very old, very dead bodies without succumbing to the come-hither wink of the Sandman? The result: 17 minutes. Having decided that this probably wasn't fair to Amanda, who was, after all, only doing her job, albeit so slowly that she appeared likely to catch rigor mortis, the following day I tried to watch Silent Witness again. Nothing wrong with the plot - Andrew Sachs as a Holocaust survivor taking revenge on the Auschwitz doctor who had tortured him and killed his twin brother - but Burton's Professor Ryan is so devoid of character and emotions that her own autopsy would reveal only a small, slightly corroded tin heart attached to an Intel Pentium processor. She laughed and cried in this episode, but these moments were like the scenes in Toy Story when Buzz Lightyear tragically assumes he's a real astronaut. 'I think you'd better go,' said Professor Replicant, when one of her students turned up on her doorstep, inveigled his way in and - my word! - asked her out on a date, a question which plainly did not compute.

The contents look like nothing. But they could hardly be more crucial. For this is a specimen of human DNA suspended in purest alcohol. The essence of being, so complex, so secret, so forceful, is here displayed as some invisible spirit in a tiny glass case: the genie in the bottle. </p> <p> Self-Conscious is the title of this piece and the DNA was extracted from Quinn, who is, incidentally, a recovering alcoholic. But this is not a self-portrait, any more than his most famous work, Self, nine pints of the artist's own blood frozen into a cast of his head. The blood head was a tremendous thing to behold - a premature death mask made of the exact quantity of the substance needed to keep us alive. Made in 1993, it has changed as the years pass by, mutable as any mortal. Like the DNA in its fragile phial, it was both metaphor and raw material. </p> <p>At 36, Quinn is the youngest and most intellectual of the Britart generation, a poet with whitecoat tendencies. He has used his own body many times as the basis for contemporary memento mori . These always depend on science for their strange half-life: liquid silicone to preserve his blood, 90-degree alcohol for the DNA, electricity to freeze an ice cast of his entire body - still gradually dissolving to this day. I have no idea how he made last year's poignant lead man, crushed to a shadow of his former self on the floor, but this imploded wraith was titled after Max Planck, founder of quantum theory. </p> <p>At White Cube2, Quinn is showing casts of a fellow artist, Alison Lapper, who was born with no arms and attenuated legs. In one work, she is eight months' pregnant and smiling beatifically. In another, she sits upright with her baby son, Parys, nestling in her lap. I guess Quinn is just tempting you to be glad that he has all his toes and fingers. </p> <p>But you will not be thinking any such thing, because mother and child are both equally perfect. These casts have been sent to Italy, where a team of stonemasons has reproduced them in flawless white marble. Alison is clearly elegant and beautiful in her own right. Translated into hard-won marble, she becomes a classical nude, a statue to make the armless Venus de Milo look incomplete. What is questioned here is not human beauty but the idealised values of art. </p> <p>Quinn's purpose is abidingly moral and serious. But he gives the work a typically contemporary twist. These figures are too pristine, too artificial and uninflected to look precisely like antique sculptures. These are not nuanced portraits of Lapper and her son so much as facsimiles of their outer casing. </p> <p>Around the sculptures are a great number of paintings that look exactly like photographs printed in high-saturation colours. These are souvenirs of Quinn's grandest enterprise so far: thousands of flowers planted in a tank of liquid silicone, a Garden of Eden for the Prada Foundation in Milan. This is not just any garden. Rhubarb, artichokes and asparagus spears grow in biblical profusion among the peonies and buttercups. The London gallery has a kind of offshoot, too; a single hybrid orchid rising from a fragile red vase. The vase is made from Quinn's blood and it looks as weird as the blossom itself - a costly genetic mutation that would normally have a dragonfly's life. </p> <p>Life-in-death, these varieties cannot wither or age as long as the silicone remains at freezing point. I imagine the Milan installation is wondrous, its mirrored glass creating an infinite effect. But the pictures in this show are a warning against endless youth and beauty. You look, you admire the eternal spring in this artificial paradise. Very soon, your appetite sickens and wanes. </p> <p>The Canadian artist <strong> Rodney Graham</strong> had a popular hit at the 1997 Venice Biennale with a video called Vexation Island . In this nine-minute loop, the artist appeared as a pirate shipwrecked on a desert island with only a parrot for company. The pirate would wake at the foot of a palm tree, gaze at the horizon and then return to unconsciousness as a falling coconut brained him. </p> <p>In Graham's new video, character replaces coconut as destiny. City Self/Country Self is set in a medieval town. A bumpkin is wandering awestruck along cobbled streets. He will soon cross paths with the city dandy, who is having his boots shined. One of the boots will end up kicking the bumpkin in slow-mo, at which point, the loop resumes. </p> <p>Needless to say, this costume drama is not what it seems, being a meditation on Freud, Sisyphus, Hollywood and, if Graham's notes are anything to go by, probably Deleuze and Roussel. You can decode it as a dense accretion of allusions to the intellectual history of the twentieth century. Or you can enjoy it as a breezy teaser, a few minutes of vaudeville from overseas.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Quidam </strong> Cirque du Soleil, Battersea Power Station, London SW11 </p> <p> Montreal's Cirque du Soleil may have started out in 1984 as people's circus, drawing on the skills of street entertainers, but it's now a class act - with prices to match. For the past four years, the company has appeared in the Royal Albert Hall; this time, performances are in its own Big Top, le Grand Chapiteau. But instead of sawdust and soda pop, champagne is on offer at \u00a345 a bottle (or \u00a32 for a soft drink). </p> <p>A tented village has pitched up until mid-February outside derelict Battersea Power Station. Cirque du Soleil has brought its own offices, canteen, physio suite and school room (the Chinese girl acrobats are only just in their teens). The long-term plan is that the power station could become a permanent base for the circus when the site is redeveloped. Given the sorry history of previous schemes for the site, nobody is predicting when that might be: guesstimates range from four to 10 years' time. </p> <p>Cirque du Soleil has already spawned a number of offshoots. As well as its base in Montreal, it has permanent shows in Las Vegas and at Walt Disney World, Orlando. Battersea would become its first purpose-built home outside North America, with its own specially created show. Quidam, the production currently touring Europe, was launched four years ago and has since been seen by over 3.5 million people. </p> <p>All the more surprising, therefore, that it seems a rather creaky show, with some acts going on for too long. The setting itself is spectacular, with an overarching bridge of girders spanning 120 feet. Aluminium rails convey acrobatic equipment and performers from a backstage platform to positions above the heads of the audience. A team of helpers in white boiler suits, looking like Woody Allen in his sperm outfit, removes spent performers and burst balloons. </p> <p>Two narrative threads are supposed to hold the show together. One is the Latin title, Quidam ('whoever'), taken to mean a nameless passer-by, lost in the crowd. The troupe wear street-people outfits for their group numbers, with some costumed as eccentric outsiders. They stare blankly rather than beguilingly at us anonymous spectators. The second thread is that of a suburban family, with the little girl who dreams the whole thing, like Lewis Carroll's Alice. </p> <p>She is seated with her parents in their 'petit salon' when she spots a curious Magritte man going by. He has an umbrella, a bowler hat and no face. He hands her the hat and the show proper begins. Her conventional parents are transported out of sight, reappearing occasionally to dress the set. The directors, Franco Dragone and Serge Roy, feel a superfluous need to animate the space with characters who have nothing to do with the breathtaking acts. </p> <p>At first, these seem linked by a theme of childhood games. Four tiny Chinese acrobats do incredible tricks with diabolos; three French Canadians spin themselves through and around aerial hoops; most of the cast get involved in mass skipping routines, led by Ren\u00e9 Bibaud, who has the fastest feet beneath a rope since Muhammad Ali. But then come the speciality acts that have nothing to do with playground activities. </p> <p>Isabelle Chass\u00e9 dangles upside down, her seemingly nude body swathed in red silk banners. She twists herself into lascivious shapes, using the silk as fetters: she lets go, plummeting head-first, only to catch her ankle in the fabric in the nick of time. The eroticism is disturbing, since the red banners look like streams of blood. </p> <p>A strongman and his pow erful partner, Richard Jecsmen and Carmita Lorador, turn an old-fashioned adagio act into a Butoh duet. They move as meditatively as Sankai Juku, while balancing each other at gravity-defying angles. The stage revolves around them, carrying bizarrely costumed figures, while they hold still in the centre. </p> <p>A tattered grey team shuffles in for the finale, eerily like the soldiers in Gloria, the First World War ballet now at the Royal Opera House. They fling white-clad girls into the air, passing them around like batons among the group. 'Banquine' turns out to be a formation tumbling routine, with flying figures bouncing off hands and heads instead of trampolines. Benoit Jutras's dramatic score, played live, takes its timing from the performers, transforming acrobatics into music-theatre. </p> <p>The French clowns are fairly funny, faintly cruel. No animals, of course, in cirque nouveau - though the Soleil team could always consider a training scheme for Battersea Dogs Home, within a sniff of the circus site.</p>",

The long-term plan is that the power station could become a permanent base for the circus when the site is redeveloped. Given the sorry history of previous schemes for the site, nobody is predicting when that might be: guesstimates range from four to 10 years' time. Cirque du Soleil has already spawned a number of offshoots. As well as its base in Montreal, it has permanent shows in Las Vegas and at Walt Disney World, Orlando. Battersea would become its first purpose-built home outside North America, with its own specially created show. Quidam, the production currently touring Europe, was launched four years ago and has since been seen by over 3.5 million people. All the more surprising, therefore, that it seems a rather creaky show, with some acts going on for too long. The setting itself is spectacular, with an overarching bridge of girders spanning 120 feet. Aluminium rails convey acrobatic equipment and performers from a backstage platform to positions above the heads of the audience. A team of helpers in white boiler suits, looking like Woody Allen in his sperm outfit, removes spent performers and burst balloons. Two narrative threads are supposed to hold the show together. One is the Latin title, Quidam ('whoever'), taken to mean a nameless passer-by, lost in the crowd. The troupe wear street-people outfits for their group numbers, with some costumed as eccentric outsiders. They stare blankly rather than beguilingly at us anonymous spectators. The second thread is that of a suburban family, with the little girl who dreams the whole thing, like Lewis Carroll's Alice. She is seated with her parents in their 'petit salon' when she spots a curious Magritte man going by. He has an umbrella, a bowler hat and no face. He hands her the hat and the show proper begins. Her conventional parents are transported out of sight, reappearing occasionally to dress the set. The directors, Franco Dragone and Serge Roy, feel a superfluous need to animate the space with characters who have nothing to do with the breathtaking acts. At first, these seem linked by a theme of childhood games. Four tiny Chinese acrobats do incredible tricks with diabolos; three French Canadians spin themselves through and around aerial hoops; most of the cast get involved in mass skipping routines, led by Ren\u00e9 Bibaud, who has the fastest feet beneath a rope since Muhammad Ali. But then come the speciality acts that have nothing to do with playground activities. Isabelle Chass\u00e9 dangles upside down, her seemingly nude body swathed in red silk banners. She twists herself into lascivious shapes, using the silk as fetters: she lets go, plummeting head-first, only to catch her ankle in the fabric in the nick of time. The eroticism is disturbing, since the red banners look like streams of blood. A strongman and his pow erful partner, Richard Jecsmen and Carmita Lorador, turn an old-fashioned adagio act into a Butoh duet. They move as meditatively as Sankai Juku, while balancing each other at gravity-defying angles. The stage revolves around them, carrying bizarrely costumed figures, while they hold still in the centre. A tattered grey team shuffles in for the finale, eerily like the soldiers in Gloria, the First World War ballet now at the Royal Opera House. They fling white-clad girls into the air, passing them around like batons among the group. 'Banquine' turns out to be a formation tumbling routine, with flying figures bouncing off hands and heads instead of trampolines. Benoit Jutras's dramatic score, played live, takes its timing from the performers, transforming acrobatics into music-theatre. The French clowns are fairly funny, faintly cruel. No animals, of course, in cirque nouveau - though the Soleil team could always consider a training scheme for Battersea Dogs Home, within a sniff of the circus site.",

Well, drive out past the sprouting towers of the now almost complete development, past the Dome, past the new exhibition centre and out to the Thames Barrier and you are in a place that makes Canary Wharf, even as it was 15 years ago, look impossibly metropolitan. On a cold December day, under a grey sky, the endless mud-brown river stretches apparently to the horizon. Everything is big here: the sky, the river, the bleak landscape. Technically, you are still in Newham, a borough whose name suggests the reassuring presence of bricks-and-mortar streets, real places and a sense of permanence. And yet this particular slice of it hardly seems like a city at all. It feels as if you have ducked under the perimeter wire of an airport. In the far distance, you can see the lights of the terminal buildings, but out on the edge you are in an aviation-fuel soaked environment where nothing is on a human scale. You feel as if you have to cling on to something to avoid the dizzy, disorientating emptiness. And that is what the newly opened Thames Barrier Park is designed to do.

It ends bleakly, with the fan locking his pregnant girlfriend in the trunk of his car and driving both of them over a bridge, but the whole thing is given an eerie sweetness by a recurring female voice apparently singing a love song to a picture on the wall. The voice belongs to Dido, a 28-year-old Arsenal fan from north London who is virtually unknown at home, but is taking America by storm. Her album No Angel has gone platinum there, selling more than a million copies (she's one of the few British artists in the US charts, with only Sade, Sting and Radiohead for company). And all because of a sample on a rap record.</p> <p>It's a lovely story, but of course the reality is more complicated. Overnight success never really happens overnight. For Dido Armstrong, it took six long years. In Britain, it's her older brother Rollo who is famous, a dance-music producer who put together Faithless, one of the groups which finally established that dance music could sell albums by the million.</p> <p>Dido was the musical one at home, taking weekend classes at Guildhall School of Music, but when she announced that she wanted to be a singer, Rollo advised her to forget it. By then she had a job working in a literary agent's office, and in the evenings she was studying for a law degree at Birkbeck. It all seemed too much to give up, and Rollo was convinced that luck couldn't strike the same family twice.</p> <p>None the less, Dido would often turn up uninvited at his studio while he was working on Faithless, particularly when there were vocals to be recorded. She eventually she got to sing on two tracks. When Faithless began to tour, she gave up the day job and went with them, but continued to work on her own music. In October 1996, she got a publishing deal with Warner-Chappell and left to strike out on her own. By the end of 1997, Rollo says proudly, 'she could have signed to almost any record label'. She chose Arista for America, but in Europe she signed via her brother's independent label Cheeky.</p> <p>No Angel is not a dance record, even though Dido co-produced it with Rollo, some of the Faithless collective and an assortment of other luminaries from the London club scene. Based around well-crafted songs with intelligent lyrics, it prompted a Washington Post critic to describe its bittersweet, sensual sound as 'makeout music for moderns'. It came out in the US in June 1999. It was supposed to be released here at around the same time, but by then Rollo had begun negotiations to sell his label to BMG/Arista, and put his release schedule on hold for the year it took to settle the deal.</p> <p>Left with nothing else to do, Dido went to America to promote her record. And stayed there. Unlike most British acts, who visit for six weeks and then run home shocked at the sheer size of the country and the sheer slog it takes to get their music across, she put in the hours and the miles. With her six-piece band, she has played over 100 shows there in the past 18 months, playing some cities six or seven times. And with guitarist Vinnie Miranda, she set out to woo the radio stations. They couldn't get on-air at first, so they just played in staff canteens, often getting elbowed out of the way by an audience more interested in their sandwiches: 'I did the most demeaning things because I was just happy to be working.'</p> <p>Once she was even offered as a competition prize, and ended up singing live-to-air from the porch of a fan's home in Texas. Slowly, the persistence began to pay off. 'Thank You' was a love song originally written for Bob, a London-based lawyer and Dido's boyfriend of five years. It's a simple, deliberately sugary song about how love can make even a bad day seem good: 'It's almost a joke, it's so sweet.' But people began to pick up on it. It appeared during the closing credits of Gwyneth Paltrow's film Sliding Doors, was played on the teen-soap Dawson's Creek, and formed the soundtrack to a 'controversial' sex scene between Sharon Stone and Ellen DeGeneres in the made-for-TV movie If The Walls Could Talk 2 .</p> <p>Meanwhile, 'Be Here Now' was chosen as the theme tune to the cult sci-fi series Roswell High, and requests for it began flooding into radio stations. Then an envelope arrived at her New York hotel with a tape of 'Stan' and a letter asking for permission to use the lengthy sample from 'Thank You'.</p> <p>What happened afterwards could well damage Eminem's reputation as the bad boy of rap. 'Stan' began getting heavy airplay in the US as soon as it came out on The Marshall Mathers LP in June, and he has been generous in his support of Dido as a result. She appeared in the song's video as the pregnant girlfriend, relishing what may be her last chance for some time to appear in public without looking deceptively perfect. She appeared on Saturday Night Live alongside him, and did a guest spot on some dates on his Anger Management tour playing to 20,000-capacity stadiums in Detroit and New Jersey.</p> <p>'He's been absolutely nothing but charming to me,' she has testified. 'Civilised. I've had a whale of a time. I've seen no misogyny about him or the people around him. They treat me with respect as a fellow artist.'</p> <p>Eminem, meanwhile, has paid gentlemanly tribute: 'She has an unbelievable voice, and her success is long overdue.' This is shocking behaviour from the man the Sun seems to hold responsible for the rise of 'yob culture', although he did redeem himself with the way he has introduced her as 'a friend of mine from motherfucking London'.</p> <p>No Angel may have picked up sales because of this exposure, but it has stayed in the US charts due to the strength of Dido's songs. And the figures show why American success is the holy grail for ambitious UK stars. The album sold a further 70,000 copies last week alone, currently standing at number 43 in the Billboard chart. It finally came out in Britain last month, a quiet release intended to discourage copies coming over from America. By Christmas it will already have gone gold, registering 100,000 sales. But the real promotion doesn't start until the New Year, when the UK should prove as eager as America to embrace it.</p> <p>Born into a bookish household (her mother is a poet; father a publisher), Dido was named after the Queen of Carthage in Virgil's Aeneid. Growing up, she saw this as an embarrassment, and often lied about her name, using Chloe instead. She says she likes the name now, 'but I'm still waiting for the day when I don't have to spell it every time I meet someone.' With critics on both sides of the Atlantic tipping her as one of the first new stars of 2001, you sense the wait is almost over.</p> <p>Dido plays the Scala, London N1 on 7 and 8 February. Her first UK single, 'Here With Me' is out in February on Arista</p>",

No Angel is not a dance record, even though Dido co-produced it with Rollo, some of the Faithless collective and an assortment of other luminaries from the London club scene. Based around well-crafted songs with intelligent lyrics, it prompted a Washington Post critic to describe its bittersweet, sensual sound as 'makeout music for moderns'. It came out in the US in June 1999. It was supposed to be released here at around the same time, but by then Rollo had begun negotiations to sell his label to BMG/Arista, and put his release schedule on hold for the year it took to settle the deal. Left with nothing else to do, Dido went to America to promote her record. And stayed there. Unlike most British acts, who visit for six weeks and then run home shocked at the sheer size of the country and the sheer slog it takes to get their music across, she put in the hours and the miles. With her six-piece band, she has played over 100 shows there in the past 18 months, playing some cities six or seven times. And with guitarist Vinnie Miranda, she set out to woo the radio stations. They couldn't get on-air at first, so they just played in staff canteens, often getting elbowed out of the way by an audience more interested in their sandwiches: 'I did the most demeaning things because I was just happy to be working.' Once she was even offered as a competition prize, and ended up singing live-to-air from the porch of a fan's home in Texas. Slowly, the persistence began to pay off. 'Thank You' was a love song originally written for Bob, a London-based lawyer and Dido's boyfriend of five years. It's a simple, deliberately sugary song about how love can make even a bad day seem good: 'It's almost a joke, it's so sweet.' But people began to pick up on it. It appeared during the closing credits of Gwyneth Paltrow's film Sliding Doors, was played on the teen-soap Dawson's Creek, and formed the soundtrack to a 'controversial' sex scene between Sharon Stone and Ellen DeGeneres in the made-for-TV movie If The Walls Could Talk 2 . Meanwhile, 'Be Here Now' was chosen as the theme tune to the cult sci-fi series Roswell High, and requests for it began flooding into radio stations. Then an envelope arrived at her New York hotel with a tape of 'Stan' and a letter asking for permission to use the lengthy sample from 'Thank You'. What happened afterwards could well damage Eminem's reputation as the bad boy of rap. 'Stan' began getting heavy airplay in the US as soon as it came out on The Marshall Mathers LP in June, and he has been generous in his support of Dido as a result. She appeared in the song's video as the pregnant girlfriend, relishing what may be her last chance for some time to appear in public without looking deceptively perfect. She appeared on Saturday Night Live alongside him, and did a guest spot on some dates on his Anger Management tour playing to 20,000-capacity stadiums in Detroit and New Jersey. 'He's been absolutely nothing but charming to me,' she has testified. 'Civilised. I've had a whale of a time. I've seen no misogyny about him or the people around him. They treat me with respect as a fellow artist.' Eminem, meanwhile, has paid gentlemanly tribute: 'She has an unbelievable voice, and her success is long overdue.' This is shocking behaviour from the man the Sun seems to hold responsible for the rise of 'yob culture', although he did redeem himself with the way he has introduced her as 'a friend of mine from motherfucking London'. No Angel may have picked up sales because of this exposure, but it has stayed in the US charts due to the strength of Dido's songs. And the figures show why American success is the holy grail for ambitious UK stars. The album sold a further 70,000 copies last week alone, currently standing at number 43 in the Billboard chart. It finally came out in Britain last month, a quiet release intended to discourage copies coming over from America. By Christmas it will already have gone gold, registering 100,000 sales. But the real promotion doesn't start until the New Year, when the UK should prove as eager as America to embrace it. Born into a bookish household (her mother is a poet; father a publisher), Dido was named after the Queen of Carthage in Virgil's Aeneid. Growing up, she saw this as an embarrassment, and often lied about her name, using Chloe instead. She says she likes the name now, 'but I'm still waiting for the day when I don't have to spell it every time I meet someone.' With critics on both sides of the Atlantic tipping her as one of the first new stars of 2001, you sense the wait is almost over. Dido plays the Scala, London N1 on 7 and 8 February. Her first UK single, 'Here With Me' is out in February on Arista",

      "body": "<p>Visiting the United States in 1922, G.K. Chesterton marvelled at the country's inane Utopian innocence. Americans, convinced of their own sanctity, gave their cities names like San Francisco or St Louis, and made sure that the sacred citadels of democracy lived up to their wholesome reputations. When he arrived in Washington, Chesterton reported with amazement that 'there really has been an effort to keep the White House white'.</p> <p>Successive coats of paint have had to be slapped on to maintain the glossy fa\u00e7ade, since that pristine building is besmirched or bemired by each of its temporary inhabitants. For Kennedy, the White House was an extension of the Playboy Club, for Nixon a paranoid den of dirty tricks. Dozy Reagan used it mostly as a dormitory. Clinton treated the place as a fantasy motel. Hence the need every few years to spruce up its symbolic allure. The latest instalment in this whitewashing of the White House is the sanctimonious television drama The West Wing which begins on Channel 4 next month.</p> <p>Martin Sheen plays President Josiah Bartlet, who can only be described as a more liberal and cleaner-shaven version of Jehovah, a man of intelligence and ethics, who despises political opportunism and dedicates himself to the betterment of mankind's lot. Thanks to its pious abstraction from the facts, The West Wing has been an unexpected success in America, watched by 13 million every week.</p> <p>The actual outgoing President, Bill Clinton, is a burger-bloated satyr; the minority of citizens who bothered to vote for his successor in November were offered a choice between two men wearing interchangeable blue suits accessorised (for demographic reasons) with similar pairs of cowboy boots. Who wouldn't prefer the wise, witty paragon played by Sheen?</p> <p>The cinema has had fun depicting the moral monstrosity of the men who, in reality, have occupied that whited sepulchre on Pennsylvania Avenue. Anthony Hopkins in Nixon captured the man's tragic, terrified isolation; John Travolta, impersonating Clinton in Primary Colors, made him a comic ogre, greedy for grease and nubile flesh. Hollywood's fictitious Presidents have usually been fools, if not outright knaves. Peter Sellers played the babbling President Merkin Muffley in Dr Strangelove. More recently, Warren Beatty rapped his way towards the White House in Bulworth, and Kevin Kline, as a clueless lookalike, replaced a comatose President in Dave.</p> <p>Jack Nicholson dopily failed to defend humanity in Mars Attacks!, while in Absolute Power Gene Hackman employed executive privilege to murder his mistress. At least Harrison Ford and Bill Pullman, respectively clobbering communists in Air Force One and fire-bombing extraterrestrials in Independence Day, upheld the honour of the office by turning the President into an action hero.</p> <p>The problem with the presidency is that the job, which calls for a man to act as a global conscience, can only properly be filled by a deity. Since gods seldom present themselves for election, America must make do with self-aggrandising monsters - a malevolent schemer like Nixon, a virtuoso fibber like Clinton. But Aaron Sorkin, who dreamed up The West Wing and writes most of the episodes, has made the rehabilitation of the sullied White House a personal mission. His script for the 1995 film The American President was Sorkin's trial run. In this, Michael Douglas, sweet-tempered and big-heartedly bipartisan, played President Andrew Shepherd, for whom the American people were a preacher's flock, tenderly coaxed towards enlightenment.</p> <p>At the time, Clinton was accepting the prayerful services of Monica Lewinsky who, prior to curtsying, strapped on what she called her 'presidential kneepads'; Douglas, as a widower wistfully hoping for a second chance, more chastely waltzes Annette Bening around the Oval Office. Having sentimentalised the presidency here, Sorkin now sanctifies it in The West Wing .</p> <p>The TV series uses sets left over from The American President and it treats this compound as if it were holy ground. When Sheen's President Bartlet sprains his ankle - impeccably green, he has chosen to fall off his bicycle rather than injure a tree - a staff member jokes that he's a klutz. The President's starchy female secretary snaps: 'I don't like irony in the Oval Office.' This bracingly freshens the air of the room where Clinton enjoyed fellatio.</p> <p>Sorkin initially planned to keep the President out of sight, concentrating instead on the manouevrings of his staff, a scruple like that of those Hollywood Biblical epics which always showed Christ from behind or merely permitted his shadow to pass over the faces of ecstatic believers. But the omission would have conceded that no human being qualifies to hold this exalted office. Sorkin therefore cast Sheen, whose CV includes roles as two crucified members of America's holy family: in 1974, he played Robert Kennedy in a television film about the Cuban missile crisis, then was promoted to JFK in a 1983 mini series. (He was also a member of Michael Douglas's staff in The American President.)</p> <p>Sheen's first appearance in The West Wing is a positive annunciation - the advent of a deus ex machina who might have descended on a cloud rather than deplaning from Air Force One. He strolls on, casually quoting the First Commandment - 'I am the Lord thy God, thou shall worship no other God but me' - and, bridling when he finds a coven of right-wing religious fanatics taking his name in vain, expels them from the precincts like Jesus resounding on the money-lenders. 'Get your fat asses out of my White House,' he snarls, sublimely unconcerned about the wrath of television evangelists.</p> <p>Such a man is too good to get elected, too good indeed to live. Predictably, martyrdom looks imminent at the end of the first series, when Sheen, after a speech in which he beseeches God to bless America, is gunned down by an assassin; I suspect he'll be miraculously resurrected for the second season.</p> <p>The President providentially intervenes in each episode as the heaven-sent scourge of homophobia, racism or whatever else Sorkin deems politically incorrect. No wonder aggrieved Republicans have claimed that The West Wing ought really to be entitled The Left Wing. But I doubt that they disapprove when Sheen, goaded to defend God's own country, starts talking like a deity who is able to deploy a nuclear arsenal. Provoked by the Syrians, he rages: 'I'm gonna blow them off the face of the earth with God's own thunder.'</p> <p>Sorkin's President manages to be both a healing Messiah and a belligerent Man. He is also, to add to the role's astral unreality, a philosopher-king of the kind envisaged by Plato. On his way to the White House, Bartlet has collected a Nobel Prize for economics. The supremacy of his mind is underlined by the debility of his body, which represents the merely mortal part of him - he suffers from multiple sclerosis, gallantly borne.</p> <p>Sorkin vouches for the man's genius by giving his courtiers lines which would only ever be uttered by the most self-seeking brown-nosers. 'You have a once-in-a-generation mind, sir,' says the President's doctor. A black aide who dotes on the President's daughter can't believe the company he keeps: 'I work in a building with the smartest people in the world!' Anxious to prove the point, Bartlet's Vice-President tells a grizzled spin doctor: 'You are a world-class political operative.' Can you imagine Gordon Brown murmuring such an endearment to Peter Mandelson?</p> <p>Beyond these craven encomia, there's little enough evidence that politics at the White House is conducted with the cerebral finesse of a Socratic seminar. Sheen's usual mode of address is the homiletic folksiness perfected by Reagan, though he does advertise his education by quoting a Latin tag, a spasm of exhibitionism which is said to have cost him the electoral votes of the state of Texas. But the atmosphere of high-mindedness, no matter how unearned, is contagious. Rob Lowe plays a speechwriter whose proudest boast is: 'I can recite the members of Congress in alphabetical order.' The casting of Lowe, a now somewhat superannuated teen pin-up, illustrates how nimbly and deviously The West Wing balances the claims of mind and body.</p> <p>He regularly takes his clothes off, though, since he's a bookish type, he keeps his spectacles on while pumping his buttocks. He gets dangerously involved with a hooker, but she, too, is using carnality to subsidise the intellect and turns tricks to put herself through law school.</p> <p>Of course, the show's version of Washington is illusory, as Sorkin has conceded: 'It's a western,' he admits. Bartlet rides a bike, not a horse, and he even falls off that. Nevertheless, he carries a gun and he fires it in the interests of righteousness. But it's the extravagant idealism of The West Wing that makes it so pertinent, when American democracy looks sadly tattered.</p> <p>The results of the presidential election in November were pre-empted by broadcasters eager to invent headlines; the outcome has been determined by teams of quibbling attorneys and by judges who owe their appointment to political patronage. Neither candidate began life in a log cabin, as the democratic myth stipulates. Heirs of political dynasties, they were each convinced of their hereditary entitlement to office. The voters, a virtual irrelevance, were notable mainly for their inability to punch holes in pieces of paper. But facts in America are always earnestly striving to match the exalted fictions on which the country was founded, so The West Wing has been a useful cover for these embarrassments, as if the show somehow demonstrated that the vaunted constitution still functions.</p> <p>During his campaign, Al Gore spurned Clinton's offers of help, but felt obliged to defer to Sheen, whom he thought of as a more honourable presidential exemplar. He visited the set of The West Wing and assured the actors he never missed an episode. Politics, which used to be the art of the possible, has become the art of the fantastical. Bumper stickers promoted the notion of 'Bartlet For President' and the Green Party even acted on the proposal, asking Sheen to become the running-mate of Ralph Nader, its nominee.</p> <p>Sheen knew better than to exchange the charmed pretence for a less satisfying reality, though the excuse he gave made him sound even holier than the intermittently bellicose Bartlet: 'I could not be President of the United States because the republic would be in jeopardy; I'm a pacifist, I couldn't take it out on a Third World nation.'</p> <p>Now that the presidency has become a branch of the entertainment industry, it's no surprise that rumourmongers expect Clinton to migrate from one show to another when he leaves office next month. It has been suggested that he may run for mayor of New York. The alternative, apparently, is a job with Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks studio, which has just released a valedictory vindication of Clinton. In The Contender, Joan Allen plays a candidate for Vice-President smirkingly vilified by a McCarthyite Republican (Gary Oldman) who has disinterred a sexual scandal from her past. The facts, once more, seek their redemption in fiction.</p> <p>The rueful gap between The West Wing and the actual political process points to a flaw in the country's conception of itself and in the constitu tion's diagram of a chief executive. The American creed requires the President to embody civic virtue. How can any politician, professionally dependent on graft, chicanery and corruption, possibly hope to measure up? And, as if rectitude intelligence and energy weren't enough, the job description nowadays demands telegenic stardom as well. Wouldn't it be better to leave the presidency to a professional actor?</p> <p>Monarchs in Shakespeare's historical dramas are judged according to the skill with which they play the king. The presidency, too, is about performance, about projecting an image of probity and avuncular affability. 'I feel your pain,' Clinton testified when he spoke to the survivors of the Oklahoma City bomb, as if he had been studying the empathetic techniques of the Method. Actors, like Reagan or Sheen, lie for a living but escape the imputation of dishonesty.</p> <p>Chesterton noted that the presidency was the last medieval monarchy, possessing unlimited power by divine right. This is even truer today, when the divine appointees like Sheen speaking with the voice of thunder, can trigger nuclear explosions. Because the office-holder is expected to be superhuman, every presidency ends in failure. If a President seems unlikely to implode as a result of skulduggery or an unwinnable war, someone can generally be relied on to shoot him.</p> <p>This record of disillusionment and disaster surely means, if you stop to think, that the office itself has failed the country which reposes such naive faith in it. Why not redistribute the executive powers elsewhere, as in our constitutional monarchy, and hire a head of state from central casting? This President's only task would be to preside decorously, while others - Bill Gates, Ted Turner and the other companies to which Bush and Gore are so beholden - got on with the business of governing.</p> <p>Under these circumstances, Martin Sheen would probably reconsider his refusal, since his duties would no longer include declaring war. And while the Americans are at it, we might do the same here. I suggest putting the Windsors out to pasture and installing Judi Dench, who was nominated for an Oscar when she played Victoria and won the award for her Elizabeth I, as the Queen. It's an acting role, after all, and she'd do it better than the present tired and grumpy incumbent.</p>",

Pop's perennial prince of pap recently came out as a 'user', explaining that not even he - now pushing an astonishing 105 - can indefinitely continue to pass for a 31-year-old without calling in the builders occasionally. </p> <p>And, of course, no one need ever know. It's not as if you're going to get people coming up to you at the bus stop and asking if you'd mind raising your eyebrows for a moment. It's not as glaringly obvious as dyeing your hair or suddenly to be seen bulging out of your trousers with spiffing new testicular implants. All the same, it does seem like the thin end of the wedge for a proper man in his forties to be seen dallying with cosmetic enhancements I can't help thinking, as I sit in an exclusive Harley Street clinic waiting for my initial consultation. I've been reading The Adonis Complex (Simon &amp; Schuster \u00a317.99), written by a trio of American psychiatrists who think that men are becoming pathologically obsessed with their looks and their weight, and, as a result, are locked into ruinous dietary and exercise regimes, leading to a cycle of compulsive cheeseburger eating, negative body-image disorders and general self-hatred. It seems men the Western world over are increasingly to be found in the bathroom removing white pubic hairs, experimenting with penile enlargement pumps and combing over their bald patches (before resorting to something called hair plugs, which I must find out more about). </p> <p>It is a subject that divides the nation, or at least people I bump into. Most are happy to concede that it's preferable to genital-piercing, which has somehow managed to get in under the wire of social acceptability as a bona fide expression of personal creativity.

Though he shiftily insisted 'It's not my Dome!', he was one of the commissioners who approved the project and he stubbornly refuses to withdraw his support now. 'At least,' he specified, 'not while friends of mine are working there.'</p> <p>Jenkins has friends everywhere, mostly in high places, and once a year he and his wife, the orchidaceous American actress Gayle Hunnicutt, invite them all to a party. Numbers preclude a domestic setting: in the past they have taken over the Battersea Power Station, St Pancras Hotel, a courtyard at the Foreign Office or the Speaker's House at Westminster. When I asked Jenkins why he loved London, despite its affray, its squalor and its lack of civility, he said: 'I enjoy the serendipitous bumping into people in restaurants, cinemas or clubs. After a while, the city itself becomes a friend.'</p> <p>It is a cosy, even cliquey view of the alienating metropolis, but Jenkins is, after all, the ultimate insider. This year, as well as helping to distribute millennial funds, he chaired the judging panel for the Booker Prize. Throughout the 1980s, he served on the board of British Railways and in the early 1990s headed the Commission for Local Democracy. (He personally sold the idea of an elected London mayor to Tony Blair and was tempted to run as a candidate for the London Assembly last year; he desisted because the election was so rigidly partisan.) He has been a governor of the Museum of London and a trustee of the World Monuments Fund. He even found time to edit the London Evening Standard between 1976 and 1978 and the Times from 1990 to 1992.</p> <p>As if this CV were not evidence enough of his established status, let me add that Jenkins belongs to the Garrick Club. And, cannily qualifying his reputation as a metropolitan networker, he has a single, lovable antiquarian foible. The hobby he lists in Who's Who is 'looking at old churches' and he has recently published a fine guide to England's thousand best, star-rated as if he were compiling an ecclesiastical Michelin or grading guests for his next party. His book is illustrated with photographs from the archive of Country Life, the magazine which gave Jenkins his first job in 1965 when he left Oxford.</p> <p>In 1992 he published The Times Guide to English Style and Usage, and he pretty much epitomises smooth English urbanity. Or perhaps he is a relic, testifying to what he has called, in a comment on the expatriate society of Shanghai in Ishiguro's novel Now We Are Orphans, 'the obsessional afterlife of Englishness'. Under his influence, Hunnicutt, the Texan belle who once played JR's mistress in Dallas, has become genteelly English. Forswearing big hair, false eyelashes, manicured nails and all the impedimenta of American beauty, she now enthusiastically gardens with a terrier snapping at her heels, collects watercolours and goes shopping in an unglamorous head scarf and raincoat like a Windsor wife.</p> <p>This man has all the bases covered. How could he possibly seek to disestablish himself? The Establishment, he said, now went by a different name - less pompous, more whimsically self-disparaging. Defending the Dome, Jenkins remembered the 'fit of political rage' which prompted the Churchill government to tear down the Dome of Discovery, erected on the South Bank for the Festival of Britain in 1951. 'Somehow,' he mused, 'these big projects seem to evoke a visceral hostility in what used to be called the Establishment and was then called the intelligentsia declension, even though it summarised the downsizing of his own ambitions.'</p> <p>Before the intelligentsia was declared redundant, Jenkins had hoped to join its ranks. At university, he wanted to become an academic. 'In those days, that seemed a glittering career,' he said with a grimace, acknowledging the way the universities have since been cowed by governments which refuse to subsidise dissent. So now, with columns in the Times and the Standard , he finds himself reduced to chitchat; his home, inevitably, is in the stretch of NW1 where all the members of his garrulous class seem to live.</p> <p>Those who dislike Jenkins on principle see him as nothing more than an ineffectual talker. Michael Leapman, profiling him recently in the New Statesman, wrote him off as a dabbler in politics without 'firm views'. Unseated as editor of the Times, he was 'stripped of his power base' and now contented himself, Leapman claimed, with fatuous 'appointments on quangos and busybody committees'. Observer critic Deyan Sudjic, who questions Jenkins's public interventions as an architectural pundit, calls him 'the acceptable face of fogeyism', affably fronting a mindless campaign against modernism.</p> <p>I'm not sure that he should be so easily dismissed. He did once unwisely remark that his collection of paintings (he specialises in English romantics like Samuel Palmer and John Piper) had made him 'a man of substance'. But he owes his substantiality to his quick, quirky, adversarial brain, not to his possessions - even if houses, horses and heirlooms were the only kind of substance esteemed by those who traditionally owned and ran this country.</p> <p>Jenkins is a contradictory figure, whose irony covers the gaps between his different personae. He belongs to the Establishment, but - since he sees the newspaper columnist as a licensed mischief-maker - likes to pull its gouty leg. Failing to gain the First he coveted in PPE, he never officially joined the intelligentsia, but he has become a keen and industrious amateur scholar: his Thousand Best English Churches is a worthy adjunct to Pevsner, replacing academic sobriety with an infectious enthusiasm. And though Jenkins chatters like a virtuoso, there is always a soul-saving message behind the wit, the waspishness, the rhetoric and the agile literary parodies. He is, I suspect, a disappointed preacher, and frequenting all those churches has made him crave a pulpit.</p> <p>'I'm not a churchman, not religious, certainly not Christian', he said when discussing the Thousand Best. 'But I'm the son of a clergyman turned theology professor, and in a way, I think we all end up trying to satisfy our father's ambitions for us. He had his weekly sermons to deliver, and I have my weekly columns to write.' Evasively ironic as always, this slight and dapper man sees himself as a remote descendant of Friar Tuck. 'The Reformation began 100 years earlier than people think, when wandering friars - yes, Friar Tuck was one of them - arrived in villages and began interpreting the gospel to the laity in the naves of churches. They had their flock of listeners in the pews, and I have my readers.'</p> <p>But the friars, I pointed out, were transmitting the truth, whereas Jenkins in his columns merely purveys opinions, which, as an inveterate ironist, he is free to disavow. 'Yes, yes,' he said, 'so the parallel collapses. And I do sometimes worry about the risks of irony. People often write in to say \"You've gone too far this time, Jenkins\".' Last month, he confessed, he was tempted to defend the notion of a European army, just because everyone else was deploring it. And after the storms at the end of October he wickedly rejoiced in the sight of a Primrose Hill plane tree which had concussed the roof of a Peugeot: 'One small step for nature,' he wrote, 'one giant leap for an integrated transport policy.' Ironists are always in danger of being understood literally: on this occasion, Jenkins nervously added a waiver, admitting that the battered Peugeot did not belong to him.</p> <p>His irony covers a genuine ideological uncertainty. As a conservationist, he is a natural Conservative - or at least, as he said, 'a sort of Conservative. At university, I was in the Labour Club, like everyone else, and I supported Labour through the 1960s. Then I was beguiled by Thatcherism, though later I became disillusioned. Thatcher campaigned against government regulation, but actually produced a more powerful state. Blair pledged to dismantle it, and he's done some devolving, though he still meddles from the centre. I'm basically a libertarian radical who dislikes government. Thatcher and Blair have both betrayed de Tocqueville's principle of association. Democracy isn't just about voting every four or five years and then going home to be a passive consumer of government policies.'</p> <p>Jenkins's beloved churches provide him with a parable of the 'communitarianism' which de Tocqueville admired in early America. 'When those itinerant friars began preaching, the naves of churches had to be rebuilt to accommodate larger congregations, and the nave then became a place where guilds met. Local government - and I'm an obsessional localist - began there. And in some countries, that's where power still resides. Forget about the global village. What we really need is just a village. I remember meeting a man in a Connecticut church last summer. He was the town treasurer, and he'd been given a hard time at a town meeting the night before, because he'd raised local taxes. I love that folksy, old-fashioned kind of democracy. Everyone ridiculed the vote-counting in Florida, but at least they were trying to find out what local people wanted. I cheered when I heard the Mayor of Bologna reacting to the BSE scare on the radio the other day. He announced that in Bologna the eating of beef was to be made compulsory, and explained that he was a butcher!'</p> <p>Jenkins had discovered a fellow ironist, skilled at finessing self-interest by making jokes. Hunnicutt has absorbed his prejudice. When they married in 1978, Jenkins insisted that she relocate to Primrose Hill. He apparently disapproved of South Kensington, where she was then living: insufficiently parochial, I suppose. She now makes a point of shopping locally and avoids the Camden Town supermarkets on principle.</p> <p>But though Jenkins supports devolution, he doesn't fancy being devolved. His affection for London, and his contempt for the restless modern cult of what he calls 'hypermobility', means that he unfashionably spends the weekends in town. 'I'm not a natural second-homer. We had a cottage for a while, but I developed a syndrome known as M4 aversion. I sat next to a woman from the West Country at dinner a while ago. She asked me how I could bear to live in London so I retaliated by asking her how she could bear to live in Somerset. I said I'd hate it, that it would kill me. She thought I was appallingly rude.' Once more, his irony had got him into trouble.</p> <p>Though he speculates in his book on churches about our 'forest origins' and the rural cult of the Green Man, Jenkins harbours no green thoughts or woodland longings. 'My son and I go to Wales every year to climb a mountain,' he told me, adding: 'Last year we had unspeakably awful weather.' The mountain-climbing is a dutiful exercise in male bonding, not something undertaken for pleasure. Tellingly, Jenkins announced the completion of an arduous cultural chore in 1995 by boasting to this readers: 'I have scaled the Matterhorn of art tourism. I have done the C\u00e9zanne show at the Grand Palais.' Preferring not to venture into the countryside, he favours rusticating the city: hence his suggestion - ironic of course, though it maddened the architectural critics - that Battersea power station should be left to crumble as a ruin, like a Tintern Abbey of the industrial age.</p> <p>Hating centralism, Jenkins occupies a privileged niche quite close to the centre of power; deploring the standardisation of opinion, he happens to be one of the opinion-makers who enforce that conformity. 'Yes,' he conceded, 'the national media have trampled the sense of local affiliation, as Ruskin predicted the railways would do. Parliament as it withers cedes power to the press. A Minister's toughest test is on Newsnight , not at the dispatch box. But we should be grateful that each day in the press we have five serious organs of opinion, each with a different point of view.'</p> <p>I began to understand the motive for Jenkins's nimble self-contradictions. He adds to the available array of opinions by having more views than one about any subject. He deliberately provokes his readers to wonder whether he can really mean what he says, and thus prompts them to mistrust the pontification of experts, including himself. Rather than preaching a dogma, he inculcates a radical, liberating creed of scepticism. Perhaps his playful manner really does mark the end of the Establishment, which used to operate by an unspoken consensus. The Thunderer - as the Times used to be known - has become a sly, teasing chatterer.</p> <p><b>Man of many parts</b></p> <p><b> Born </b> 10 June 1943 in Birmingham.</p> <p><b> Educated </b> Mill Hill School; St John's College, Oxford (PPE).</p> <p><b> 1977 </b> Became editor of the Evening Standard, aged 33.</p> <p><b>1978 </b> Married Gayle Hunnicutt; has one son, one stepson.</p> <p><b> 1979-86 </b> Political editor of the Economist.</p> <p><b> 1990-92 </b> Editor, the Times.</p> <p><b> Jenkins is a voracious joiner of committees, boards and quangos.

'At least,' he specified, 'not while friends of mine are working there.' Jenkins has friends everywhere, mostly in high places, and once a year he and his wife, the orchidaceous American actress Gayle Hunnicutt, invite them all to a party. Numbers preclude a domestic setting: in the past they have taken over the Battersea Power Station, St Pancras Hotel, a courtyard at the Foreign Office or the Speaker's House at Westminster. When I asked Jenkins why he loved London, despite its affray, its squalor and its lack of civility, he said: 'I enjoy the serendipitous bumping into people in restaurants, cinemas or clubs. After a while, the city itself becomes a friend.' It is a cosy, even cliquey view of the alienating metropolis, but Jenkins is, after all, the ultimate insider. This year, as well as helping to distribute millennial funds, he chaired the judging panel for the Booker Prize. Throughout the 1980s, he served on the board of British Railways and in the early 1990s headed the Commission for Local Democracy. (He personally sold the idea of an elected London mayor to Tony Blair and was tempted to run as a candidate for the London Assembly last year; he desisted because the election was so rigidly partisan.) He has been a governor of the Museum of London and a trustee of the World Monuments Fund. He even found time to edit the London Evening Standard between 1976 and 1978 and the Times from 1990 to 1992. As if this CV were not evidence enough of his established status, let me add that Jenkins belongs to the Garrick Club. And, cannily qualifying his reputation as a metropolitan networker, he has a single, lovable antiquarian foible. The hobby he lists in Who's Who is 'looking at old churches' and he has recently published a fine guide to England's thousand best, star-rated as if he were compiling an ecclesiastical Michelin or grading guests for his next party. His book is illustrated with photographs from the archive of Country Life, the magazine which gave Jenkins his first job in 1965 when he left Oxford. In 1992 he published The Times Guide to English Style and Usage, and he pretty much epitomises smooth English urbanity. Or perhaps he is a relic, testifying to what he has called, in a comment on the expatriate society of Shanghai in Ishiguro's novel Now We Are Orphans, 'the obsessional afterlife of Englishness'. Under his influence, Hunnicutt, the Texan belle who once played JR's mistress in Dallas, has become genteelly English. Forswearing big hair, false eyelashes, manicured nails and all the impedimenta of American beauty, she now enthusiastically gardens with a terrier snapping at her heels, collects watercolours and goes shopping in an unglamorous head scarf and raincoat like a Windsor wife. This man has all the bases covered. How could he possibly seek to disestablish himself? The Establishment, he said, now went by a different name - less pompous, more whimsically self-disparaging. Defending the Dome, Jenkins remembered the 'fit of political rage' which prompted the Churchill government to tear down the Dome of Discovery, erected on the South Bank for the Festival of Britain in 1951. 'Somehow,' he mused, 'these big projects seem to evoke a visceral hostility in what used to be called the Establishment and was then called the intelligentsia declension, even though it summarised the downsizing of his own ambitions.' Before the intelligentsia was declared redundant, Jenkins had hoped to join its ranks. At university, he wanted to become an academic. 'In those days, that seemed a glittering career,' he said with a grimace, acknowledging the way the universities have since been cowed by governments which refuse to subsidise dissent. So now, with columns in the Times and the Standard , he finds himself reduced to chitchat; his home, inevitably, is in the stretch of NW1 where all the members of his garrulous class seem to live. Those who dislike Jenkins on principle see him as nothing more than an ineffectual talker. Michael Leapman, profiling him recently in the New Statesman, wrote him off as a dabbler in politics without 'firm views'. Unseated as editor of the Times, he was 'stripped of his power base' and now contented himself, Leapman claimed, with fatuous 'appointments on quangos and busybody committees'. Observer critic Deyan Sudjic, who questions Jenkins's public interventions as an architectural pundit, calls him 'the acceptable face of fogeyism', affably fronting a mindless campaign against modernism. I'm not sure that he should be so easily dismissed. He did once unwisely remark that his collection of paintings (he specialises in English romantics like Samuel Palmer and John Piper) had made him 'a man of substance'. But he owes his substantiality to his quick, quirky, adversarial brain, not to his possessions - even if houses, horses and heirlooms were the only kind of substance esteemed by those who traditionally owned and ran this country. Jenkins is a contradictory figure, whose irony covers the gaps between his different personae. He belongs to the Establishment, but - since he sees the newspaper columnist as a licensed mischief-maker - likes to pull its gouty leg. Failing to gain the First he coveted in PPE, he never officially joined the intelligentsia, but he has become a keen and industrious amateur scholar: his Thousand Best English Churches is a worthy adjunct to Pevsner, replacing academic sobriety with an infectious enthusiasm. And though Jenkins chatters like a virtuoso, there is always a soul-saving message behind the wit, the waspishness, the rhetoric and the agile literary parodies. He is, I suspect, a disappointed preacher, and frequenting all those churches has made him crave a pulpit. 'I'm not a churchman, not religious, certainly not Christian', he said when discussing the Thousand Best. 'But I'm the son of a clergyman turned theology professor, and in a way, I think we all end up trying to satisfy our father's ambitions for us. He had his weekly sermons to deliver, and I have my weekly columns to write.' Evasively ironic as always, this slight and dapper man sees himself as a remote descendant of Friar Tuck. 'The Reformation began 100 years earlier than people think, when wandering friars - yes, Friar Tuck was one of them - arrived in villages and began interpreting the gospel to the laity in the naves of churches. They had their flock of listeners in the pews, and I have my readers.' But the friars, I pointed out, were transmitting the truth, whereas Jenkins in his columns merely purveys opinions, which, as an inveterate ironist, he is free to disavow. 'Yes, yes,' he said, 'so the parallel collapses. And I do sometimes worry about the risks of irony. People often write in to say \"You've gone too far this time, Jenkins\".' Last month, he confessed, he was tempted to defend the notion of a European army, just because everyone else was deploring it. And after the storms at the end of October he wickedly rejoiced in the sight of a Primrose Hill plane tree which had concussed the roof of a Peugeot: 'One small step for nature,' he wrote, 'one giant leap for an integrated transport policy.' Ironists are always in danger of being understood literally: on this occasion, Jenkins nervously added a waiver, admitting that the battered Peugeot did not belong to him. His irony covers a genuine ideological uncertainty. As a conservationist, he is a natural Conservative - or at least, as he said, 'a sort of Conservative. At university, I was in the Labour Club, like everyone else, and I supported Labour through the 1960s. Then I was beguiled by Thatcherism, though later I became disillusioned. Thatcher campaigned against government regulation, but actually produced a more powerful state. Blair pledged to dismantle it, and he's done some devolving, though he still meddles from the centre. I'm basically a libertarian radical who dislikes government. Thatcher and Blair have both betrayed de Tocqueville's principle of association. Democracy isn't just about voting every four or five years and then going home to be a passive consumer of government policies.' Jenkins's beloved churches provide him with a parable of the 'communitarianism' which de Tocqueville admired in early America. 'When those itinerant friars began preaching, the naves of churches had to be rebuilt to accommodate larger congregations, and the nave then became a place where guilds met. Local government - and I'm an obsessional localist - began there. And in some countries, that's where power still resides. Forget about the global village. What we really need is just a village. I remember meeting a man in a Connecticut church last summer. He was the town treasurer, and he'd been given a hard time at a town meeting the night before, because he'd raised local taxes. I love that folksy, old-fashioned kind of democracy. Everyone ridiculed the vote-counting in Florida, but at least they were trying to find out what local people wanted. I cheered when I heard the Mayor of Bologna reacting to the BSE scare on the radio the other day. He announced that in Bologna the eating of beef was to be made compulsory, and explained that he was a butcher!' Jenkins had discovered a fellow ironist, skilled at finessing self-interest by making jokes. Hunnicutt has absorbed his prejudice. When they married in 1978, Jenkins insisted that she relocate to Primrose Hill. He apparently disapproved of South Kensington, where she was then living: insufficiently parochial, I suppose. She now makes a point of shopping locally and avoids the Camden Town supermarkets on principle. But though Jenkins supports devolution, he doesn't fancy being devolved. His affection for London, and his contempt for the restless modern cult of what he calls 'hypermobility', means that he unfashionably spends the weekends in town. 'I'm not a natural second-homer. We had a cottage for a while, but I developed a syndrome known as M4 aversion. I sat next to a woman from the West Country at dinner a while ago. She asked me how I could bear to live in London so I retaliated by asking her how she could bear to live in Somerset. I said I'd hate it, that it would kill me. She thought I was appallingly rude.' Once more, his irony had got him into trouble. Though he speculates in his book on churches about our 'forest origins' and the rural cult of the Green Man, Jenkins harbours no green thoughts or woodland longings. 'My son and I go to Wales every year to climb a mountain,' he told me, adding: 'Last year we had unspeakably awful weather.' The mountain-climbing is a dutiful exercise in male bonding, not something undertaken for pleasure. Tellingly, Jenkins announced the completion of an arduous cultural chore in 1995 by boasting to this readers: 'I have scaled the Matterhorn of art tourism. I have done the C\u00e9zanne show at the Grand Palais.' Preferring not to venture into the countryside, he favours rusticating the city: hence his suggestion - ironic of course, though it maddened the architectural critics - that Battersea power station should be left to crumble as a ruin, like a Tintern Abbey of the industrial age. Hating centralism, Jenkins occupies a privileged niche quite close to the centre of power; deploring the standardisation of opinion, he happens to be one of the opinion-makers who enforce that conformity. 'Yes,' he conceded, 'the national media have trampled the sense of local affiliation, as Ruskin predicted the railways would do. Parliament as it withers cedes power to the press. A Minister's toughest test is on Newsnight , not at the dispatch box. But we should be grateful that each day in the press we have five serious organs of opinion, each with a different point of view.' I began to understand the motive for Jenkins's nimble self-contradictions. He adds to the available array of opinions by having more views than one about any subject. He deliberately provokes his readers to wonder whether he can really mean what he says, and thus prompts them to mistrust the pontification of experts, including himself. Rather than preaching a dogma, he inculcates a radical, liberating creed of scepticism. Perhaps his playful manner really does mark the end of the Establishment, which used to operate by an unspoken consensus. The Thunderer - as the Times used to be known - has become a sly, teasing chatterer. Man of many parts Born 10 June 1943 in Birmingham. Educated Mill Hill School; St John's College, Oxford (PPE). 1977 Became editor of the Evening Standard, aged 33. 1978 Married Gayle Hunnicutt; has one son, one stepson. 1979-86 Political editor of the Economist. 1990-92 Editor, the Times. Jenkins is a voracious joiner of committees, boards and quangos. These include: British Railways Board; BR Environment Panel; Grade Committee on Fear of Crime; Commission of Local Democracy (chairman); Municipal Journal Ltd (director); The Bow Group (council member); Save Britain's Heritage; Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission; The Millennium Commission; Institute of Contemporary Arts (council member); Thirties Society (deputy chairman); Railway Heritage Trust (founder and director); World Monuments Fund (trustee); Museum of London (governor); Calcutt Committee on Privacy; Lady Runciman's inquiry into drugs legislation; Save Britain's Heritage; Booker Prize Jury 2000 (chairman).",

      "body": "<p>Griff Rhys-Jones is not directly responsible for last week's job losses in Luton, despite the generally poor reception for the TV adverts featuring him as a limo-loving, ginger-bearded geek who makes do with a Vauxhall. Rather than the quality of an individual ad campaign, it is the growth of the advertising industry as an emblem of the changing industrial landscape that may have affected manufacturing fortunes. </p> <p>It took one call last Tuesday from Zurich to make 2,200 jobs disappear in Luton. The day before, in the Midlands, 1,200 workers lost their jobs at the textiles maker formerly owned by Coats Viyella. Figures out last week show that 95,000 UK manufacturing jobs were lost between August and October. </p> <p>Last week was truly dreadful for British manufacturing, but can and should anything be done about it? </p> <p>Consider the process by which Vauxhall's parent company, General Motors, came to its decision, and the amount of non-manufacturing work used to reach it. Vauxhall employs a public relations firm to handle some of the flak over job losses. It asked management and strategy consultants which factories should go, and sought help from lawyers and human resources consultants over redundancy packages. It spends a fortune on marketing its cars. It put one in a giant fish tank at the Birmingham motor show and used the opening notes from Madonna's hit, 'Papa Don't Preach', for its commercials. And don't forget Griff. </p> <p>The economics of the 'weightless' new industries are attractive - they are high margin, high added value, and relatively low cost. Their capital requirements are small, and there is no need for stock controls and inventories. The market for weightless products - despite cultural differences - is immediately and costlessly global, driving the returns on their production even higher. </p> <p>Indeed, this shift is possible even within an industry. ARM Holdings, the darling of the UK new economy, designs blueprints for the core of a microchip, but licenses out these designs to its customers to manufacture. It has quickly established a global market and is profitable. </p> <p>If higher returns are a carrot to move out of manufacturing, the stick is international trade. It is no coincidence that last week's major losses were in industries where global competition is strong. </p> <p>The inevitability of this shift from manufacturing to services is factored into the Government's official projections of employment prospects. </p> <p>By 2009 the Government expects some 670,000 manufacturing jobs to be lost, the lion's share in engineering. A third of all jobs in textiles and clothing will go over the next decade. But employment in business and miscellaneous services will increase by 1.9 million over this time. </p> <p>These projections are a continuation of a trend seen over the past 30 years. In 1971 manufacturing accounted for 32 per cent of total employment, compared with 16 per cent in 1998. Conversely, business and miscellaneous services accounted for 12 per cent of all jobs in 1971, but 24 per cent in 1998. </p> <p>The strong pound may have played a part in last week's losses, but their grim inevitability is driven by globalisation. It is ironic, then, that the Luton announcement came the day after the Government released a White Paper on this subject. </p> <p>One section reads: 'The reality is that all profound economic change produces winners and losers. The role of government in these circumstances is to help manage the process of change - to maximise economic opportunities for all, and to equip people, through education and active labour market policies, to take advantage of these opportunities.' </p> <p>The context was the world's poorest countries, but the words are just as applicable to Luton and Dagenham, and to Alfreton in Derbyshire, where the former Coats Viyella firm had a factory. </p> <p>Indeed, even given public displays of regret, these shutdowns are fully in tune with government philosophy. Improving productivity has been the mantra of this administration.

      "bodyText": "Griff Rhys-Jones is not directly responsible for last week's job losses in Luton, despite the generally poor reception for the TV adverts featuring him as a limo-loving, ginger-bearded geek who makes do with a Vauxhall. Rather than the quality of an individual ad campaign, it is the growth of the advertising industry as an emblem of the changing industrial landscape that may have affected manufacturing fortunes. It took one call last Tuesday from Zurich to make 2,200 jobs disappear in Luton. The day before, in the Midlands, 1,200 workers lost their jobs at the textiles maker formerly owned by Coats Viyella. Figures out last week show that 95,000 UK manufacturing jobs were lost between August and October. Last week was truly dreadful for British manufacturing, but can and should anything be done about it? Consider the process by which Vauxhall's parent company, General Motors, came to its decision, and the amount of non-manufacturing work used to reach it. Vauxhall employs a public relations firm to handle some of the flak over job losses. It asked management and strategy consultants which factories should go, and sought help from lawyers and human resources consultants over redundancy packages. It spends a fortune on marketing its cars. It put one in a giant fish tank at the Birmingham motor show and used the opening notes from Madonna's hit, 'Papa Don't Preach', for its commercials. And don't forget Griff. The economics of the 'weightless' new industries are attractive - they are high margin, high added value, and relatively low cost. Their capital requirements are small, and there is no need for stock controls and inventories. The market for weightless products - despite cultural differences - is immediately and costlessly global, driving the returns on their production even higher. Indeed, this shift is possible even within an industry. ARM Holdings, the darling of the UK new economy, designs blueprints for the core of a microchip, but licenses out these designs to its customers to manufacture. It has quickly established a global market and is profitable. If higher returns are a carrot to move out of manufacturing, the stick is international trade. It is no coincidence that last week's major losses were in industries where global competition is strong. The inevitability of this shift from manufacturing to services is factored into the Government's official projections of employment prospects. By 2009 the Government expects some 670,000 manufacturing jobs to be lost, the lion's share in engineering. A third of all jobs in textiles and clothing will go over the next decade. But employment in business and miscellaneous services will increase by 1.9 million over this time. These projections are a continuation of a trend seen over the past 30 years. In 1971 manufacturing accounted for 32 per cent of total employment, compared with 16 per cent in 1998. Conversely, business and miscellaneous services accounted for 12 per cent of all jobs in 1971, but 24 per cent in 1998. The strong pound may have played a part in last week's losses, but their grim inevitability is driven by globalisation. It is ironic, then, that the Luton announcement came the day after the Government released a White Paper on this subject. One section reads: 'The reality is that all profound economic change produces winners and losers. The role of government in these circumstances is to help manage the process of change - to maximise economic opportunities for all, and to equip people, through education and active labour market policies, to take advantage of these opportunities.' The context was the world's poorest countries, but the words are just as applicable to Luton and Dagenham, and to Alfreton in Derbyshire, where the former Coats Viyella firm had a factory. Indeed, even given public displays of regret, these shutdowns are fully in tune with government philosophy. Improving productivity has been the mantra of this administration. Workers at the Luton plant went some way to achieving this by making sacrifices on pay and conditions. But this is not enough. Increasing productivity may be most closely understood as squeezing ever more production from labour and capital. But the easiest way to do this is to close down low-productivity plants and open new ones, or for firms to get out of old industries and enter 'new' ones - 'creative destruction', in the words of economist Joseph Schumpeter. The macroeconomic story is exacerbated by the peculiarities of the industries involved. Overcapacity in the car industry is global. The world motor industry could make 75 million cars a year, yet it sells only 55 million. Western markets are now mature, and future demand will come from the Asia Pacific region and eastern Europe. In the US, GM has scrapped its Oldsmobile brand, which is the equivalent of doing away with Vauxhall entirely. Forget, if you like, that manufacturing cars is seen as a symbol of economic virility. The real point is that it's also an important employer, directly and indirectly. Some US government analyses rank car manufacturing with computer and microchip production as 'high-tech'. The UK's record on high-specification car design is superb, but in manufacturing terms this country is now suffering from being a first mover with dated plant. Yet manufacturing is where the most employment is. As for the manufacturing industries seamlessly converting into high-value, weightless industries, it's worth noting that the combined workforces of ARM, Bookham and Baltimore Technologies, all high-tech favourites, is less than those 2,200 jobs lost at Luton. These companies may be worth billions, but that is partly because they employ relatively few people. The growth of the service sector masks two divergent trends.

Why announce the closure just before Christmas? </p> <p>Unless, of course, General Motors was afraid that come January qualified majority voting in the Employment and Social Affairs Council of the European Union would have forced it to consult the workforce before wielding the axe. </p> <p>It will be scant consolation to the Vauxhall employees, but at least they live in the generally prosperous south-east, where unemployment rates are low. Some of them will get new jobs. </p> <p>But if you are a production line worker, the chance of finding a similar occupation is slight, and growing ever slighter. It is also unlikely that you are going to become a dotcom millionaire, or even work for one. For many the only realistic possibility must be labouring in a DIY warehouse or behind the counter in a supermarket petrol station. And although car workers are no longer the relatively rich artisans that they were back in the Seventies, they are certainly better paid than shop assistants. </p> <p>Of course, some amount of occupational change is inevitable. Just as people left the land for the the factories, so they must adapt to the post-industrial revolution. But the low pay that characterises much of the burgeoning service sector is not the only problem with this progression. </p> <p>There is also the fact that most of the manufacturing job losses come in places far removed from the vacancies of the Home Counties, where the property market is so buoyant that professionals such as teachers are being priced out. What chance of an unemployed textile worker from Derbyshire getting on her bike and finding affordable accommodation?

      "bodyText": "Lasdt week's sorry events in Luton served only to confirm my feeling that despite the armies of consultants employed on its behalf, business sadly lacks real public relations skills. Why announce the closure just before Christmas? Unless, of course, General Motors was afraid that come January qualified majority voting in the Employment and Social Affairs Council of the European Union would have forced it to consult the workforce before wielding the axe. It will be scant consolation to the Vauxhall employees, but at least they live in the generally prosperous south-east, where unemployment rates are low. Some of them will get new jobs. But if you are a production line worker, the chance of finding a similar occupation is slight, and growing ever slighter. It is also unlikely that you are going to become a dotcom millionaire, or even work for one. For many the only realistic possibility must be labouring in a DIY warehouse or behind the counter in a supermarket petrol station. And although car workers are no longer the relatively rich artisans that they were back in the Seventies, they are certainly better paid than shop assistants. Of course, some amount of occupational change is inevitable. Just as people left the land for the the factories, so they must adapt to the post-industrial revolution. But the low pay that characterises much of the burgeoning service sector is not the only problem with this progression. There is also the fact that most of the manufacturing job losses come in places far removed from the vacancies of the Home Counties, where the property market is so buoyant that professionals such as teachers are being priced out. What chance of an unemployed textile worker from Derbyshire getting on her bike and finding affordable accommodation? And the state of our transport system hardly encourages long-distance commuting, even if it were financially viable. The Government fought hard for Rover and even raised an eyebrow at Ford's Dagenham executions. But their lack of reaction to the Luton massacre suggests that ministers have given up trying to prevent closures. Presumably, therefore, they have some other strategy in mind to ease the UK's transition into the brave new world. What could it be? There is increasing talk of encouraging more high-tech clusters outside the M4 corridor and Silicon Fen, but these tend to grow organically and, in any case, assisting their development would require much more regional accountability. Let's see the White Paper. In the meantime, we know inward investment is fickle. Shouldn't we at least be voting in Europe to extend workers' protection, not attempting to block it?",

      "body": "<p>In winter, Blackpool is like a pantomime Dame without her face on. It has most life at weekends, when hen and stag party revellers stagger against driving wind and rain lashing in from the Irish Sea. </p> <p>Punch-ups are as regular as a portion of chips. This is hardly surprising given that the dwindling number of funseeking visitors are greeted by an itinerant population whose male unemployment rate hits 50 per cent out of season. Mix that with the highest density of pubs and clubs in the country, and the result is often combustible. </p> <p>But don't write Blackpool off. You'd be hard pressed to find a space in the North West more beautiful than the Tower Ballroom. On a Sunday morning, dedicated waltzers glide serenely through mock Belle Epoque splendour, seemingly oblivious to the decay outside. </p> <p>But Blackpool could soon be dancing to a very different tune. The Government is anxious to claw back gambling revenue which over the past few years drifted offshore. So it is considering liberalising the gaming laws for the first time in more than 30 years - since gangland turf wars forced the authorities to crack down on dodgy dens. </p> <p>Next June, the Gambling Review Body will decide on whether to recommend the introduction of 24-hour, instant-membership casinos and a less restrictive gaming tax regime. If they do, the Government will draft legislation. Currently if you want to play in a casino, you apply to one of the country's 120 casinos and wait a day to have membership confirmed. </p> <p>A queue of operators - mindful that gambling in the UK has been legitimised by the National Lottery - are ready and waiting to spin a wheel at a venue near you. </p> <p>But in Blackpool, one casino operator is laying 'siege' to a town hall desperate for inward investment. In 1998 Trevor Hemmings, who started working life as a bricklayer but is now one of Britain's richest men, bought Blackpool Tower and the faded Winter Gardens for \u00a374 million from Michael Grade's First Leisure. Hemmings' vehicle, Leisure Parcs, has been consolidating its holdings in the town with major land purchases. </p> <p>Last August, the company showed its hand. With the Government desperate to kick-start the regeneration of Britain's coastal resorts, Leisure Parcs unveiled a plan to create three casinos in Blackpool. Ultimately, the company says, Blackpool could have 12 hotel/casinos. </p> <p>Hemmings' plan is being implemented by a 40-year-old former Center Parcs executive, Marc Etches, who has spent the past few months explaining his case to Tourism Minister Janet Anderson as well as Tory leader William Hague and assorted locals. </p> <p>It was his idea to take a delegation of local businessmen, hotel representatives, council officials, leisure and gaming consultants and one national newspaper journalist on a week-long fact-finding investigation to the world's gambling capital, Las Vegas, and to Atlantic City, which has used gaming as a catalyst for urban regeneration. The trip was paid for by the Blackpool Challenge Partnership. How could I say 'No'? </p> <p>'Margaritas by the yard,' deadpanned Nigel Hanson, Blackpool's town centre manager, referring to a casino poster. 'That's Blackpool.' </p> <p>That's as close as it gets though. To Blackpool folk and to most outsiders, Vegas is Sin City - a jaw-dropping, mind-boggling, morality defying, architectural one-off in the Nevada desert. It's America's fastest-growing city, with a new home built every 15 minutes. Vegas is now poised to spill over into the hills which until now have enclosed it in a 450-square mile basin. But growth comes at a cost. Thanks to the exploding population, the Colorado River, on which Las Vegas, California, Arizona, Nevada and Colorado rely, is no longer flowing so fast into the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>Once seedy, Vegas has reinvented itself: for the first time ever last year, convention income outstripped the \u00a33 billion gained from gambling. As we learn from the Scorsese movie Casino, everyone in Vegas watches everyone else. Steve Ducharme, the state's chief law enforcer, confirmed that of 500 major casino cons each year, half involve the venue's own staff. </p> <p>And though Vegas is desperate to appeal to the outsider, gambling appears to be part of the city's psyche. If you're a 'low-rolling Johnny Six-Pack', the place to go is Sunset Station in a down-at-heel residential area. On a Monday morning, the punters were all middle-aged women stuffing slot machines with dollars while a fortysomething woman smiled down from a poster proclaiming: 'I made Pay Day, Play Day.' </p> <p>Blackpool was aghast. 'If I saw my old dear in there, I'd drag her out,' said Roy Fisher, Blackpool's deputy council leader. 'There's a cr\u00e8che in there. You wouldn't want that for Blackpool. I find that abhorrent.' Heads nodded in agreement. </p> <p>It was in Atlantic City that Blackpool officials found what they were looking for: a city which has used gambling as a catalyst for regeneration. Atlantic City (AC) used to be America's Blackpool. Last century, the railroads brought wagonloads of East Coast Americans here to experience 'vacations' for the first time. The place thrived. </p> <p>'Like Blackpool, Atlantic City has always been a bit naughty,' explained AC's genial third-generation Irish Mayor, James Whelan. In a country where only Nevada had legal gambling until 1979, you could always get a bet down in AC. 'We made the mistake of prohibition in the US. It never came here. It was a rumour.' </p> <p>But the growth of internal flights after 1945 dealt AC a body blow. Americans chose to visit Florida and California instead. AC refused to reinvest in itself. What finally did for the place was the 1964 Democratic Convention, where reporters brandished cockroaches found in hotels in front of cameras. AC became a standing joke - much like Blackpool after the 1998 Labour conference. </p> <p>By 1979, casino gambling was legal in AC. For 10 years there was a gold rush. Property developers, including Donald Trump, bought up swathes of land and refused to develop them until they had sufficient investment, which in highly leveraged Trump's case was not often. </p> <p>In 1990, after New Jersey granted the city 1.25 per cent of all gambling revenue, things began to move. Since then AC has invested in transport, high-quality affordable housing and a huge convention centre. </p> <p>It was a visit to the AC Boys &amp; Girls club which convinced the 'Blackpool posse' that gaming was legit. </p> <p>A \u00a33m investment from Park Place, one of the leading casinos, seemed to have paid dividends. Troubled youngsters were offered facilities that Blackpool folk could only dream of: a full-sized indoor basketball court, computer terminals, art facilities and pool and table tennis tables. At 5.45pm, when you'd expect youngsters to be tetchy, the kids were high spirited but well-behaved. </p> <p>'This is what it's all about. How can you say gambling is bad when you see this,' said Josie Hammond of the Blackpool Hotel &amp; Guest Association. 'Why shouldn't we have casinos? Betting shops and slot machines are everywhere and no one blinks an eye.' </p> <p>But it wasn't all cherry pie. Atlantic City has moved a whole swathe of its troubled citizens out of the centre and dumped them in trailer parks hidden by trees on the side of a freeway. Nevertheless, overall Blackpool was impressed. </p> <p>Assuming, as is widely expected, that the Gambling Review Body advocates a liberalisation of the gaming laws, it will be up to the Government to set the regulatory and tax framework. And here comes the rub. Blackpool wants gaming to be trialled in its town. This, they believe, will make Blackpool rich again. Blackpool also wants to get a slice of the tax to invest in its own people. </p> <p>Without that, the town's councillors would probably reject casinos. And that seems fair enough. Why should money generated from such a controversial activity go elsewhere? </p> <p>What Blackpool is asking for is unprecedented. But then so are resort casinos. The Government, and Blackpool, have an enormous decision to make. </p> <p>Ultimately, what is sad is that only through gambling, a pastime that tends to make poor people poorer, can Blackpool hope to find a way to rejuvenate itself. </p> <p><strong>Hemmings' big gamble could land him the jackpot</strong></p> <p>The jackpot will be enormous for Trevor Hemmings if he succeeds in becoming the first owner of a Las Vegas-style British resort casino. </p> <p>Tens of millions of pounds could roll into his company's coffers. Hemmings' initially wants to build a 500-room hotel with slot machines, roulette wheels and card tables under the working title of The Pharaoh's Palace. The plan is then to build another two casinos. Hemmings' people believe that ultimately Blackpool could take up to a dozen casinos, although town-planning chiefs are dubious. </p> <p>Hemmings' assumption is understood to be that his \u00a3120 million casino investment could start to show a return within five years. The stakes are so high that Hemmings' organisation, Leisure Parcs, has put in place a supremely efficient lobbying machine, with down-to-earth likeable 40-year-old Marc Etches at its heart. </p> <p>Etches, who next month will take a group of British MPs to Vegas and Atlantic City, is supremely well connected in both political and gaming circles. </p> <p>He is on first-name terms with Tourism Minister, Janet Anderson and last month dined with Tory leader William Hague. Etches has invited on the fact-finding trip Peter Moore - the Northern Irish leisure consultant who ran the Alton Towers theme park and Center Parcs - the Nineties equivalent of Butlins for the keep-fit generation. </p> <p>Moore, who worked with Etches at Center Parcs, also chairs a government taskforce charged with reviving British coastal resorts. </p> <p>Leisure Parcs is closely associated with London Clubs International, the UK-quoted casino operator. London Clubs employs as a consultant Bill Galston - a former chief inspector for the Gaming Board. </p> <p>For Hemmings, casinos represent a slice of a gambling empire that includes the Littlewoods pool business and six racecourses. Hemmings is also in the Go Racing consortium with BSkyB and Channel 4, which is bidding to broadcast horseracing in the UK.</p>",

Last week, Abbey rejected Lloyds TSB's latest \u00a318.6bn informal offer, but failed to unveil its planned deal with BoS. Instead, Abbey and BoS will this week lodge their plans with regulators, kicking off a 35-day timetable for expected clearance of the deal. Banking sources said Lloyds would do the same.

      "body": "<p>On the first day of Christmas... you wouldn't want to buy a house, would you? </p> <p>Nevertheless, despite a quiet autumn, the year looks set to end with more than 1,000 house sales worth \u00a31 million or over, and house price inflation of around 9 per cent across the country, according to the Nationwide building society. And the market is getting unexpectedly busier as the holiday approaches. </p> <p>'In the past people always looked for a reason not to buy, or to put off the process, and Christmas was the best excuse of all,' says David Forbes of estate agency Chesterfield. 'These days they realise procrastination can cost money, so they are prepared to bite the bullet.' </p> <p>Peter Rollings of London agency Foxtons agrees: 'Recent weeks have been extraordinarily busy. It's been like a return to the busiest weeks of the spring, with more people wanting to know what's on the market.' </p> <p>In London and the Home Counties, agents are preparing for the City bonus rush immediately after the holiday. In January-March this year, 30 per cent of all house purchases above \u00a3500,000 in that part of the country involved buyers working in the financial sector, according to agency Knight Frank. In 2000 some 950 City workers received bonuses of \u00a3500,000 or more. A similar surge into the property market is expected in early 2001. </p> <p>For those wanting to get in before the rush, though, Yuletide is a trivial distraction. Sometimes it is the estate agents who, uncharacteristically, are turning away business from customers who want to ignore Christmas. You can end up feeling positively sorry for some of these people. </p> <p> <strong> The last-minute buyer</strong> </p> <p> 'Last Christmas Eve I had a very keen buyer and seller desperate to agree a deal on a \u00a32m house in Chelsea,' recalls Johnny Fuller of Chesterfields. 'They were still haggling at 9pm as I was on my mobile driving to my father's in Winchester,' he says. In a rare example of an estate agent electing not to close a deal, Fuller switched off his mobile on Christmas Day, and the pair agreed a price later than they wanted.</p> <p> <strong> Christmas is about sharing</strong> </p> <p> Just before Christmas 1998 Rebecca Read of Cluttons had a client selling in central London's Eaton Square. The seller said she could not complete until December 29, but the buyer wanted to be in before Christmas Day. </p> <p>The solution? 'The purchaser moved in a week before Christmas and they lived together for a fortnight,' says Read. </p> <p> <strong> Give yourself a surprise present</strong> </p> <p> David Forbes of Chesterfields went into his office on 27 December 1998 to catch up on paperwork only to be disturbed by an American who had stumbled out of a restaurant, tired and emotional after a good lunch. </p> <p>'In between hiccups he told me he wanted to buy a home, and could he look at them right now,' he recalls. 'I took him on a tour of three properties, he made an offer and they exchanged within 48 hours on a house worth \u00a33m.' </p> <p> <strong> Offer someone a home this Christmas</strong> </p> <p> In the early Nineties Chard estate agent Gail Clark was checking a flat on Boxing Day for a tenant to move in the next day, and found it had been burgled. The thief had stolen minor electrical items, put cigarette burns in the carpets and smeared some of his McDonald's dinner over the furniture. </p> <p>'I had to clean the flat from top to bottom, find a glazier prepared to come out on Boxing Day, buy replacement items, patch the ciga rette burns by sticking spare carpet over them, and wash the sofa covers,' she says. 'The tenant moved in happily on December 27, not realising how I had spent my Boxing Day.' </p> <p> <strong> Make an estate agent happy</strong> </p> <p> That is what Charles and Ann Wood have done - but they won a Christmas bonus into the bargain. 'Our new house in Pontefract was completed on 3 November, and the developer and estate agent wanted to get it off their books before Christmas,' says Mr Wood. 'So they offered us a \u00a37,300 reduction if we moved in before the holiday - that's nearly 10 per cent of the purchase price. So we put our house on the market and moved in on 8 December. The whole process took about three weeks.' </p> <p>If moving over Christmas is too horrific a thought, you may want to extend a cup of friendship to an estate agent by committing to buy one of these seasonal addresses on the market at the moment. </p> <p>There is Holly House, a four-bedroom house with dis tant sea views in Suffolk (\u00a3365,000, details from 01473 234800). The same agency has a restored country home called Plum Pudding, (pictured below) costing \u00a3525,000). Or there is High Wood House, a six-bedroom family house on Oxfordshire's Christmas Common (\u00a31m, details from 01491 843001). </p> <p>During 2000, agents in the South East have already disposed of a Snowball Cottage, The Hollies, a St Nicholas Cottage and, of course, a Christmas Cottage. </p> <p>Have a good one.</p> <p><strong>Unreal world</strong></p> <p>Lapland is a vast region of Northern Europe, largely within the Arctic Circle, occupying Northern Norway, Northern Sweden, Northern Finland, and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. The climate is severe, and there is very little vegetation except in the forested southern area. </p> <p>Lapland's most famous citizen is, of course, Father Christmas, who occupies an impressive grotto with his elves and their toymaking workshop. The reindeer in Lapland outnumber the Lapps or Laplanders and house prices are fairly reasonable compared with this country: a sparse population means few buyers. Most dwellings consist of wooden cabins, with the odd ice palace occupied by snow royalty.</p>",

In January-March this year, 30 per cent of all house purchases above \u00a3500,000 in that part of the country involved buyers working in the financial sector, according to agency Knight Frank. In 2000 some 950 City workers received bonuses of \u00a3500,000 or more. A similar surge into the property market is expected in early 2001. For those wanting to get in before the rush, though, Yuletide is a trivial distraction. Sometimes it is the estate agents who, uncharacteristically, are turning away business from customers who want to ignore Christmas. You can end up feeling positively sorry for some of these people. The last-minute buyer 'Last Christmas Eve I had a very keen buyer and seller desperate to agree a deal on a \u00a32m house in Chelsea,' recalls Johnny Fuller of Chesterfields. 'They were still haggling at 9pm as I was on my mobile driving to my father's in Winchester,' he says. In a rare example of an estate agent electing not to close a deal, Fuller switched off his mobile on Christmas Day, and the pair agreed a price later than they wanted. Christmas is about sharing Just before Christmas 1998 Rebecca Read of Cluttons had a client selling in central London's Eaton Square. The seller said she could not complete until December 29, but the buyer wanted to be in before Christmas Day. The solution? 'The purchaser moved in a week before Christmas and they lived together for a fortnight,' says Read. Give yourself a surprise present David Forbes of Chesterfields went into his office on 27 December 1998 to catch up on paperwork only to be disturbed by an American who had stumbled out of a restaurant, tired and emotional after a good lunch. 'In between hiccups he told me he wanted to buy a home, and could he look at them right now,' he recalls. 'I took him on a tour of three properties, he made an offer and they exchanged within 48 hours on a house worth \u00a33m.' Offer someone a home this Christmas In the early Nineties Chard estate agent Gail Clark was checking a flat on Boxing Day for a tenant to move in the next day, and found it had been burgled. The thief had stolen minor electrical items, put cigarette burns in the carpets and smeared some of his McDonald's dinner over the furniture. 'I had to clean the flat from top to bottom, find a glazier prepared to come out on Boxing Day, buy replacement items, patch the ciga rette burns by sticking spare carpet over them, and wash the sofa covers,' she says. 'The tenant moved in happily on December 27, not realising how I had spent my Boxing Day.' Make an estate agent happy That is what Charles and Ann Wood have done - but they won a Christmas bonus into the bargain. 'Our new house in Pontefract was completed on 3 November, and the developer and estate agent wanted to get it off their books before Christmas,' says Mr Wood. 'So they offered us a \u00a37,300 reduction if we moved in before the holiday - that's nearly 10 per cent of the purchase price. So we put our house on the market and moved in on 8 December. The whole process took about three weeks.' If moving over Christmas is too horrific a thought, you may want to extend a cup of friendship to an estate agent by committing to buy one of these seasonal addresses on the market at the moment. There is Holly House, a four-bedroom house with dis tant sea views in Suffolk (\u00a3365,000, details from 01473 234800). The same agency has a restored country home called Plum Pudding, (pictured below) costing \u00a3525,000). Or there is High Wood House, a six-bedroom family house on Oxfordshire's Christmas Common (\u00a31m, details from 01491 843001). During 2000, agents in the South East have already disposed of a Snowball Cottage, The Hollies, a St Nicholas Cottage and, of course, a Christmas Cottage. Have a good one. Unreal world Lapland is a vast region of Northern Europe, largely within the Arctic Circle, occupying Northern Norway, Northern Sweden, Northern Finland, and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. The climate is severe, and there is very little vegetation except in the forested southern area. Lapland's most famous citizen is, of course, Father Christmas, who occupies an impressive grotto with his elves and their toymaking workshop. The reindeer in Lapland outnumber the Lapps or Laplanders and house prices are fairly reasonable compared with this country: a sparse population means few buyers. Most dwellings consist of wooden cabins, with the odd ice palace occupied by snow royalty.",

Now she wants to sort herself out so she can retire at 60 and fulfil her ambition to travel. </p> <p>'I don't want to travel in great luxury, but I do want to travel widely,' she says. Places she would like to see include South America, India and the Far East. 'I want to be young enough, and fit enough - and have enough money to enjoy myself.' </p> <p>Until then she will go on working full-time as a university lecturer. Although she is fortunate to be a member of a public-sector final salary pension scheme, she is concerned about how much she will get. She has been contributing only since she went back into full-time work at 37, after bringing up her three children. </p> <p>To top up her pension, she has been make additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) with the Prudential for four years. Last year she upped her contributions to the maximum ,so she is now paying 15 per cent of her salary into her pension. </p> <p>But she is still plagued by doubts: 'Will I have enough for my retirement? Should I be buying added years instead of making AVCs?'. </p> <p>She won't be sharing her ex-husband's pension. Theirs was a clean-break divorce two years ago. </p> <p>Jane is concerned about her mortgage, too. After she divorced, she bought a property - 'smaller than a family home but big enough for friends and family to come to stay'. To cover the cost she took a flexible mortgage with Standard Life which is due to run until she is 65, though she aims to try to repay it by the time she is 60. However, so far, despite good intentions, she has not yet managed to pay any extra. </p> <p>She is now wondering, as she has enough room, whether it would be a good idea to take in a lodger and use the money to pay off her mortgage, or to save more for retirement. Indeed, she feels she could start saving another \u00a3100 a month right away if she tried hard. </p> <p>On the ordinary savings front, she has \u00a31,000 in a Barclays Tessa, which she fears may be earning a low rate of interest, plus \u00a33,000 each in two cash Individual Savings Accounts, which she opened this year and in 1999 with Barclays and Alliance &amp; Leicester. </p> <p>Part of this is money her husband gave to her when they divorced. She sees this as a combination of safety net, cash towards a new car and 'rainy day' money. </p> <p>Her three children are now in their twenties, and the youngest will be finishing university this year. Thereafter, she feels she will be in a better position to save, although she would still like to help her children out financially if necessary. </p> <p>More pension, less of a mortgage, more holidays, money for children. 'Am I asking too much?' she says.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Gordon Wilson</strong></p> <p>Jane has taken effective action in a number of areas. However, her mortgage is due to be repaid five years after she retires. I strongly advise repaying it before she turns 60. </p> <p>Any spare funds should be used to reduce the balance. Money from a lodger could help greatly and is tax-efficient, as the income is likely to qualify for rent-a-room relief. Jane could make up to \u00a34,250 tax free.</p> <p>The money she has in cash Isas would be better used to reduce her mortgage: the interest rates are less than she is paying on her loan.</p> <p>Jane should provide an expenditure analysis to help establish the level of income she will need in retirement. Any additional pension planning could then aim at this level. If surplus savings remain she could consider more liquid investments, such as equity Isas.</p> <p>On the current figures, at 60, Jane will probably have the equivalent of 23 years in the Teachers' Superannuation Scheme. On a salary of \u00a329,000, this equates to a pension of \u00a38,337 a year and a lump sum of \u00a325,000. Her state pension will be added to this, and Jane should fill in Benefits Agency form BR19 for a forecast.</p> <p>AVCs are an inflexible form of savings with, at best, modest tax advantages. The option of added years is likely to look expensive, but Jane should request a quote from her employer.</p> <p>Gordon Wilson works for financial adviser Thomson and Shepherd.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 2: Sharon Linnard </strong></p> <p>Jane's priorities should be to repay her mortgage by the time she is 60 and ensure she has sufficient income for retirement. </p> <p>Her mortgage allows additional repayments to be made without redemption penalties. She should ask what extra monthly repayment is needed to pay it off five years early. The money for this could be taken from the additional savings she wishes to make now and when her children finish university.</p> <p>Her excellent occupational pension scheme guarantees her a good income based on years of service and her pay immediately prior to retirement.</p> <p>She is already endeavouring to enhance her pension by making AVCs with Prudential. However, it would be appropriate for her to request the additional years that could be purchased by transferring from Prudential and maintaining her current contribution. Added years do not come cheap, but would give her a further lump sum and extra income.</p> <p>She could switch her Barclays Tessa to one paying more interest.</p> <p>She could take in a lodger and put the money towards her retirement. Further Isas could be established, but it would be advisable for Jane to look at equity Isas, which offer greater opportunity for capital growth, provided she understands the potential volatility associated with this type of investment. </p> <p>Sharon Linnard works for chartered accountant KPMG. </p> <p>Advice is for guidance only.</p> <p>\u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

      "bodyText": "Jane Clarke Age 51 Lives in Leicester Occupation University lecturer Earns \u00a329,000 Mortgage \u00a350,000 Debts None Investments Tessa, Cash Isas Pension Member of occupational scheme Aims Pay off mortgage, top up pension to ensure enough income for travel in retirement, provide financial help for children if necessary Jane Clarke is in her early fifties and until recently had never thought much about money or planning the future. Now she wants to sort herself out so she can retire at 60 and fulfil her ambition to travel. 'I don't want to travel in great luxury, but I do want to travel widely,' she says. Places she would like to see include South America, India and the Far East. 'I want to be young enough, and fit enough - and have enough money to enjoy myself.' Until then she will go on working full-time as a university lecturer. Although she is fortunate to be a member of a public-sector final salary pension scheme, she is concerned about how much she will get. She has been contributing only since she went back into full-time work at 37, after bringing up her three children. To top up her pension, she has been make additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) with the Prudential for four years. Last year she upped her contributions to the maximum ,so she is now paying 15 per cent of her salary into her pension. But she is still plagued by doubts: 'Will I have enough for my retirement? Should I be buying added years instead of making AVCs?'. She won't be sharing her ex-husband's pension. Theirs was a clean-break divorce two years ago. Jane is concerned about her mortgage, too. After she divorced, she bought a property - 'smaller than a family home but big enough for friends and family to come to stay'. To cover the cost she took a flexible mortgage with Standard Life which is due to run until she is 65, though she aims to try to repay it by the time she is 60. However, so far, despite good intentions, she has not yet managed to pay any extra. She is now wondering, as she has enough room, whether it would be a good idea to take in a lodger and use the money to pay off her mortgage, or to save more for retirement. Indeed, she feels she could start saving another \u00a3100 a month right away if she tried hard. On the ordinary savings front, she has \u00a31,000 in a Barclays Tessa, which she fears may be earning a low rate of interest, plus \u00a33,000 each in two cash Individual Savings Accounts, which she opened this year and in 1999 with Barclays and Alliance &amp; Leicester. Part of this is money her husband gave to her when they divorced. She sees this as a combination of safety net, cash towards a new car and 'rainy day' money. Her three children are now in their twenties, and the youngest will be finishing university this year. Thereafter, she feels she will be in a better position to save, although she would still like to help her children out financially if necessary. More pension, less of a mortgage, more holidays, money for children. 'Am I asking too much?' she says. Adviser 1: Gordon Wilson Jane has taken effective action in a number of areas. However, her mortgage is due to be repaid five years after she retires. I strongly advise repaying it before she turns 60. Any spare funds should be used to reduce the balance. Money from a lodger could help greatly and is tax-efficient, as the income is likely to qualify for rent-a-room relief. Jane could make up to \u00a34,250 tax free. The money she has in cash Isas would be better used to reduce her mortgage: the interest rates are less than she is paying on her loan. Jane should provide an expenditure analysis to help establish the level of income she will need in retirement. Any additional pension planning could then aim at this level. If surplus savings remain she could consider more liquid investments, such as equity Isas. On the current figures, at 60, Jane will probably have the equivalent of 23 years in the Teachers' Superannuation Scheme. On a salary of \u00a329,000, this equates to a pension of \u00a38,337 a year and a lump sum of \u00a325,000. Her state pension will be added to this, and Jane should fill in Benefits Agency form BR19 for a forecast. AVCs are an inflexible form of savings with, at best, modest tax advantages. The option of added years is likely to look expensive, but Jane should request a quote from her employer. Gordon Wilson works for financial adviser Thomson and Shepherd. Adviser 2: Sharon Linnard Jane's priorities should be to repay her mortgage by the time she is 60 and ensure she has sufficient income for retirement. Her mortgage allows additional repayments to be made without redemption penalties. She should ask what extra monthly repayment is needed to pay it off five years early. The money for this could be taken from the additional savings she wishes to make now and when her children finish university. Her excellent occupational pension scheme guarantees her a good income based on years of service and her pay immediately prior to retirement. She is already endeavouring to enhance her pension by making AVCs with Prudential. However, it would be appropriate for her to request the additional years that could be purchased by transferring from Prudential and maintaining her current contribution. Added years do not come cheap, but would give her a further lump sum and extra income. She could switch her Barclays Tessa to one paying more interest. She could take in a lodger and put the money towards her retirement. Further Isas could be established, but it would be advisable for Jane to look at equity Isas, which offer greater opportunity for capital growth, provided she understands the potential volatility associated with this type of investment. Sharon Linnard works for chartered accountant KPMG. Advice is for guidance only. \u0095 Do you want to appear in Wealthcheck?

The child's capital gains tax allowance, currently \u00a37,200 a year, should ensure that they earn profit without paying tax. </p> <p>And you can avoid paying income tax by choosing a trust which invests for growth rather than income.

The Merrill Lynch fund is new but the longer-running Sarasin fund has made a 200 per cent profit in five years. </p> <p>Ben Yearsley of financial adviser Hargreaves Landsdown says he would choose a technology or healthcare unit trust such as Framlington Health or Invesco Global Dynamic, which selects the companies expected to do best within six themed investment sectors. </p> <p>You may consider buying a gift of shares direct, but buying small portions of shares is usually expensive: most stockbrokers operate a minimum charge. The cheapest start at about \u00a315. </p> <p>But the advantage of choosing shares is that you can tailor the gift to match the interests of your friends or relatives. Football fans, chocoholics and computer nerds can all be catered for. </p> <p>Yearsley says something to keep in mind for a present next year is stakeholder pensions, the Government's new low-cost private pension scheme. You can invest \u00a33,600 a year tax free in a stakeholder pension for children and non-working parents. </p> <p>He says there are pros and cons to putting your gift into a pension. On one hand 'a thousand pounds now will be worth a fortune in 60 years, but on the other you cannot access the money under any circumstances until then. </p> <p>For shorter- term investments, you could look at cash Isas or with-profits savings plans. Deposits can be monthly or yearly over the 10-year life of the plan. </p> <p>However, remember that the problem with investments as presents for adults is that the recipient has to sign for them, so the element of surprise is lost. Remember, too, that children cannot hold investments in their own names. The best you can do is 'designate' the investment to the child, which means tagging their name on to yours. </p> <p>Rather than appealing to someone's avaricious side, you could always make a financial gift that speaks to their better nature - by giving money to charity on their behalf. If you make use of the generous tax breaks available, the value of your donation will be boosted. </p> <p>Tax-effective giving means using schemes which allow the charity to reclaim the basic rate tax on your gift. The Government's Gift Aid scheme will turn a \u00a310 gift into \u00a312.82 after a charity has reclaimed tax. </p> <p>The Charities Aid Foundation runs a charity card account which operates under Gift Aid. The account allows you to write cheques to the charity of your choice including schools, scout groups and hospitals. CAF will then honour the cheque. CAF says it will guarantee your money goes to a reputable charity. Oxfam and the National Trust are among he most popular. </p> <p>Some 70,000 people currently make donations this way, and as you can open an account in another person's name, they make suitable Christmas presents.

You may consider buying a gift of shares direct, but buying small portions of shares is usually expensive: most stockbrokers operate a minimum charge. The cheapest start at about \u00a315. But the advantage of choosing shares is that you can tailor the gift to match the interests of your friends or relatives. Football fans, chocoholics and computer nerds can all be catered for. Yearsley says something to keep in mind for a present next year is stakeholder pensions, the Government's new low-cost private pension scheme. You can invest \u00a33,600 a year tax free in a stakeholder pension for children and non-working parents. He says there are pros and cons to putting your gift into a pension. On one hand 'a thousand pounds now will be worth a fortune in 60 years, but on the other you cannot access the money under any circumstances until then. For shorter- term investments, you could look at cash Isas or with-profits savings plans. Deposits can be monthly or yearly over the 10-year life of the plan. However, remember that the problem with investments as presents for adults is that the recipient has to sign for them, so the element of surprise is lost. Remember, too, that children cannot hold investments in their own names. The best you can do is 'designate' the investment to the child, which means tagging their name on to yours. Rather than appealing to someone's avaricious side, you could always make a financial gift that speaks to their better nature - by giving money to charity on their behalf. If you make use of the generous tax breaks available, the value of your donation will be boosted. Tax-effective giving means using schemes which allow the charity to reclaim the basic rate tax on your gift. The Government's Gift Aid scheme will turn a \u00a310 gift into \u00a312.82 after a charity has reclaimed tax. The Charities Aid Foundation runs a charity card account which operates under Gift Aid. The account allows you to write cheques to the charity of your choice including schools, scout groups and hospitals. CAF will then honour the cheque. CAF says it will guarantee your money goes to a reputable charity. Oxfam and the National Trust are among he most popular. Some 70,000 people currently make donations this way, and as you can open an account in another person's name, they make suitable Christmas presents. However, a 4 per cent administration charge will slightly reduce the value of your donation. CAF also issues gift vouchers, but there is no tax advantage. The vouchers can be written for any amount and go to any charity. More information about Gift Aid is available on the revenue's website, www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk or on 0151 472 6056.

      "body": "<p>Old coins and banknotes, bronze medieval artefacts, hand-written parchment title deeds, cigarette cards, paper ephemera, even Penny Black stamps, can be a hit as Christmas gifts because they look much more valuable than they are. </p> <p>A two-millennia old coin is a wonderful thing to handle. And a set of cigarette cards or a crisp, unused wartime pound note (from \u00a37.50) will fill grandparents with nostalgia. </p> <p>The reason such things are so cheap is that pre-decimal coins, say, or cigarette cards, though no longer common currency in every household, are still plentiful in the collectors' market, and the most common items still fetch only a few pounds, whether they are inter-war, Victorian or Roman. </p> <p>Hitherto, the gift market and the collectors' market have scarcely overlapped. At Christmas, shoppers scrambling for fancy soaps or hankies in high street stores seldom give a thought to the dimly lit coin dealers in the side street. But it is in such little shops that much-appreciated gifts can be found. </p> <p>A fine-condition fourth-century bronze coin of Constantine the Great, the first Christian emperor, can be bought from dealers for a fiver, the price asked by London-based Coincraft. </p> <p>Another London coin dealer, Philip Cohen, sells late Victorian silver crowns (minted 1887-1900), in used but pleasant condition, for \u00a312. Scratched or dented ones are \u00a35-\u00a37 and mint (uncirculated) from \u00a350. If you are giving a present to a non-collector you don't need mint condition coins. In fact, a bit of wear can add authenticity. </p> <p>There is a reason why Cohen is able to offer mint-condition 1887 silver half-crowns bearing Queen Victoria's new portrait for only \u00a325. It was the Queen's golden jubilee year and they were hoarded, as Churchill crowns were later, in the hope that they would appreciate in value. Instead, they glutted the market. Those massive, magnificent George III cartwheel pennies of 1797, which are nearly 1.5 inches in diameter and weigh an ounce, are \u00a315-\u00a320 from Cohen in fine condition. They were minted by the engineer Matthew Boulton to show off his new steam-driven coin press ,whose site in Soho, Birmingham, is stamped on the coin. But look sharp; some gift buyers are cottoning on to the golden jubilee half-crown and the cartwheel penny. A year ago, Cohen's price for the cartwheel penny was only \u00a310. Another coin dealer has ordered 100 from him at his new price of \u00a315-\u00a320, confident that he can turn a profit. </p> <p>My prize example of the very old, very famous, but very common and very cheap is the bronze widow's mite, in use in the Holy Land during Christ's lifetime. These, in good to fine condition, are being sold by Coincraft for \u00a315. </p> <p>Small and usually badly struck, they were the only coin the Romans allowed the Jews to mint. Chris Martin, London mail-order dealer in ancient art, offers them for \u00a310, or \u00a320 in a silver mount. Could the one you buy be one of the two that Christ saw the poor widow cast into the treasury? Highly unlikely, but possible. </p> <p>Cigarette cards? For \u00a38.50 the London Cigarette Card Company, based in Somerset, will sell you Wills's set of 50 Household Hints of 1936 - its card showing three uses for used newspapers should strike a fresh chord among today's eco-warriors, but how many of them would want to know how to bitumen-felt a garden shed? Grandpa, ex-wartime ARP, would be thrilled to receive Wills's 50 Air Raid Precautions of 1938, \u00a330. </p> <p>Grandma may have seen precious few pound notes during the war. So present her with a 1940 blue pound note with the swirling foliate design on the back, only \u00a37.50 in very fine or \u00a316.50 in extra fine condition from the London banknote dealer Colin Narbeth. </p> <p>Narbeth, Cohen and the stamp dealer Robert Langsfield share the same shop at 20 Cecil Court, off London's Charing Cross Road. If you wish to impress ignoramuses in your family by giving them a genuine Penny Black of 1840, the world's first postage stamp (some people still think they are rare), Langsfield will sell you one for \u00a320. It would have only three margins intact (the stamps were unperforated and they were cut with scissors) and faults such as pin holes. Average condition four-margin Penny Blacks are \u00a360-\u00a380. </p> <p>Parchment 'title deeds' are plentiful, impressive, and cheap. Each one is made from the skin of a whole sheep, stretched, scraped and cured, and the legal rubric is hand-written in quill pen . </p> <p>They were burned on bonfires when the Land Registry made them obsolete in 1926. Every one tells a story of real people - a mortgage, a tenancy, a marriage agreement, an apprenticeship. </p> <p>Michael Kashden prices his Victorian mortgage agreements from \u00a310. The more fascinating the story told by the deed, the higher the price. Among his stock, priced at \u00a345, is the seven-year shipbuilding and carpentry apprenticeship agreement of one James Beer, aged 15, of Ramsgate, who in 1866, so it is written, promised not to reveal his master's secrets and 'shall not play at cards or dice tables' and 'shall not haunt taverns or play houses'. </p> <p>My favourite is manuscript paper ephemera, which comprise the throwaway documents of everyday life that occasionally survive for generations. Examples of what you can buy from member-dealers of the Ephemera Society are: for \u00a38, a written receipt of 1777 signed by Richard Hodgkins for 12s 11d paid for 11 gallons and one pint of beer 'for laborers in the Church yard'. For \u00a35: Mr I. Messer's quarterly Poor Law receipt for \u00a31/12s, signed in 1799 by the Hampstead workhouse overseer, Stephen Mallard. </p> <p>A newcomer in presentable collectables are medieval artefacts unearthed by mudlarks and and metal detectors.

But now they are switching to a tougher target - adults. </p> <p>An 'interactive adult learning program' will be available, free, on the Financial Service's Authority website by spring. Instead of just giving out facts about retirement planning, for instance, people will be able to test their understanding by trying to answer a few questions. The FSA has decided to go down this route because it has discovered that interaction is a far better learning tool than just providing information. </p> <p>And it believes that there is a need to help adults make better decisions about mortgages, pensions and other financial products. 'The level of understanding is not good,' says its head of consumer education Deborah Arnott. She quotes research suggesting that 20 per cent of people approaching retirement believe that pensions are not taxable and that 40 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds rely on friends and family for personal finance advice. </p> <p>But even without the FSA's program, there are many sources of help for adults. On pensions, the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (OPAS) runs a free helpline and the TUC also runs a pension helpline. Trade bodies such as the Association of Unit Trusts and the Association of Investment Trust Companies also produce leaflets, although people will have to remember that they have a vested interest in promoting these products. But the FSA is now trying to go a step further in spreading the word to the adult population, because it believes that publicising the availability of information is probably a tougher task than getting people, once they have the information, to understand the issues. </p> <p>The FSA is now trying to encourage employers to distribute personal finance information. It hopes that more will follow the example of Sainsbury's and MBNA, the credit card bank. Sainsbury's, which is worried by the fact that 70,000 of its 170,000 staff are missing out on employer's contributions by not joining the pension scheme, has started personal finance help sessions for employees. </p> <p>MBNA meanwhile has a financial education service manager, Harper Wright, who has had individual sessions with 400 of the company's 2,500 UK staff. The advice is generic. It explains, for instance, the different types of mortgages or pension schemes. Other employers might wonder what Sainsbury's and MBNA get out of this. Wright says: 'Our chairman asks the question \"where will my people go for advice?\" There is no longer a high street bank manager around to talk to. If people are not worried about whether they have the right mortgage, they are going to be a better employee.' </p> <p>The FSA will be trying to encourage other employers to take this route. If employers are providing stress counselling, the FSA believes they could do more in this arena. 'Why not provide counselling on personal finance?' says Arnott. The main focus for employers at the moment is retirement planning, but this is usually confined to employees who are a few months off retirement. 'You need to reach them when they are making their initial decisions, such as taking out their first mortgage or starting a pension,' she says. Employers will be forced into thinking through these issues to some degree next year when they have until October to arrange access to the new 'stakeholder pensions'. The FSA is looking to the US where evidence from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that 88 per cent of businesses which run a pension scheme also provide some sort of financial education programme. 'The thing that really works is seminars,' says Arnott. </p> <p>Employers in the UK will worry about just how much advice they can give to staff. The personal pension mis-selling scandal of a decade ago was partly exacerbated by the constraints on employers not to recommend their own pension scheme when employees decided to transfer out into a personal pension. 'That was a real cloud that hung over many employers,' says Peter Clarke, president of the Institute of Actuaries. </p> <p>Another problem for employers will be how to answer the questions of employees. Some employers are concerned, for instance, about staff who are completely financially bound up with them - through the pension scheme and by holding the company's own shares. If an employer suggested that such an employee should diversify and invest elsewhere, the employee's next question is likely to be 'How?' </p> <p>Some employees might also wonder about the reliability of information provided at work. </p> <p>After all, some employers have invited personal pension sales staff into their premises and thereby aided the handing out of some bad financial advice, such as opting out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme, Serps, for example, in cases where this was a bad move. Government and regulators are considering these and other difficult questions. </p> <p>The FSA, having got personal finance on to the school curriculum this September, will now have to push to encourage teachers to take up the subject. In the workplace, parts of the infrastructure are also already there, says Alan Grant, the former TUC head of education who now works in consumer education at the FSA. He says: 'There are computer resources in the workplace that could be turned over to help people with their learning. It takes a push.' </p> <p> FSA helpline , 0845 606 1234; website, <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk\">www.fsa.gov.uk</a>; OPAS helpline, 020 7233 8080; Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds: leaflet orderline, 020 8207 1361; website, <a href=\"http://www.investmentfunds.org.uk\">www.investmentfunds.org.uk</a>; Association of Investment Trust Companies, 020 7431 5222; website - <a href=\"http://www.aitc.co.uk\">www.aitc.co.uk</a>.</p>",

The FSA is looking to the US where evidence from the National Bureau of Economic Research suggests that 88 per cent of businesses which run a pension scheme also provide some sort of financial education programme. 'The thing that really works is seminars,' says Arnott. Employers in the UK will worry about just how much advice they can give to staff. The personal pension mis-selling scandal of a decade ago was partly exacerbated by the constraints on employers not to recommend their own pension scheme when employees decided to transfer out into a personal pension. 'That was a real cloud that hung over many employers,' says Peter Clarke, president of the Institute of Actuaries. Another problem for employers will be how to answer the questions of employees. Some employers are concerned, for instance, about staff who are completely financially bound up with them - through the pension scheme and by holding the company's own shares. If an employer suggested that such an employee should diversify and invest elsewhere, the employee's next question is likely to be 'How?' Some employees might also wonder about the reliability of information provided at work. After all, some employers have invited personal pension sales staff into their premises and thereby aided the handing out of some bad financial advice, such as opting out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme, Serps, for example, in cases where this was a bad move. Government and regulators are considering these and other difficult questions. The FSA, having got personal finance on to the school curriculum this September, will now have to push to encourage teachers to take up the subject. In the workplace, parts of the infrastructure are also already there, says Alan Grant, the former TUC head of education who now works in consumer education at the FSA. He says: 'There are computer resources in the workplace that could be turned over to help people with their learning. It takes a push.'

As Peter Mann of J H Mann Ltd (7 Hillsborough Road, Sheffield, South Yorks; 0114 234 3538) explains, the fishing industry all but closes down over Christmas and New Year, after which it takes a couple of weeks before things return to normal. Some fish will not be back at their best for a long while after that; if you like plaice, buy now while it's at its best, because it goes out of condition as the year turns.

He buys at auction all along the south coast from Devon to Rye, selecting the best for his shop, exporting the rest. Premium quality fish comes from day boats (that go out for 12 hours) landing catches at Brixham, Lyme Regis and Looe, but bigger boats out of Newlyn stay at sea for perhaps five days, catching good-sized brill, turbot, megrim, hake, conger eel and tuna. Ask any self-respecting cook about scallops and they will swear by diver-caught ones, which Clive Samways sells, but he reckons dredged ones have had a rather harsh press, so he also sells 'beautiful quality' scallops (70p each, cut and cleaned) that have been dredged by small boats. His father-in-law, David Williams, runs the shop, and a fledgling mail-order service is now up and running.</p> <p>Clive Samways is not alone is his view of dredged scallops. Phil Bowditch of Phil Bowditch (7 Bath Place, Taunton, Devon; 01823 253 500) - who, weather permitting, buys mullet, John Dory, sea bass, gurnard, sole, huss, cod, haddock, pollock and much more from Brixham day boats - is also a supporter. When caught by small boats, scallops are towed for around 20 minutes, so are still alive, free from grit, and available in larger quantities than diver-caught ones. He has less luck with prawns only because of their price. The Spanish are prepared to pay much more than we are, but since they also take large quantities of hake, megrim and cuttlefish, they help to keep the industry healthy. Phil Bowditch also has a good word for trawlers (not surprisingly, since he has one of his own), not least because some fish actually improve with a little keeping on the five-day trips: not plaice or oily fish such as mackerel, but Dover sole and turbot, for example, provided they are properly treated and kept on ice.</p> <p>Phil Bowditch doesn't do mail order because 'people want to see what they are buying', but for people (like me) who don't live near a good fishmonger, mail order from a good supplier is the sensible solution. Club Chef Direct (Lakeside, Bridgwater Road, Barrow Gurney, Bristol; 01275 475 252) is taking orders up to Thursday 21 December for delivery on Friday. But the earlier an order is placed, the more it stands a chance of turning up on time. Last orders are taken tomorrow at Quayside Fish (The Harbourside, Porthleven, Cornwall; 01326 562 008).

Of course it's a good idea to have a drink-free day, but many people then get into the routine of saving up their alcohol consumption for the weekend or social occasions and then go completely over the top.'</p> <p>MacNeill talks of health issues (we should bear in mind that it's the amount of alcohol we consume over a lifetime that will affect our bodies in the long term), but there are also the little indignities.

'Some people may be extremely sociable in their drinking habits, but in the end realise they are becoming more dependent and that socialising is no longer the main point.'</p> <p>Jon, an owner-manager of a medium-sized company, has always found plenty of reasons to work late and socialise with his clients. For him, as for many of us, alcohol is possibly just too available. 'We have a company bar, which I always thought was a great way for employees to bond together. But naturally nobody is in there drinking tonic water. We're mostly a male company and that would seem a bit weird - as if you had a drink problem.

And it has a lot to do with affluence; when I was younger, I just couldn't afford to drink so much.'</p> <p>It is not only men who feel the pressure to drink when they socialise. A 50 per cent increase in younger women's alcohol consumption over the past 10 years is due in part to the development of more women-friendly drinking places. This means women's drinking is now conducted openly, and its social context lends it a respectable mantel that a solitary gin over the washing up - 'mother's ruin' - never had.</p> <p>As Gillian, a self-employed PR who recently had to cope with a messy divorce, reflects: 'I have to take a conscious decision not to have a glass of wine, otherwise it's an automatic thing at the end of the day and often at lunchtimes, too.

In the past, if I've been very miserable, I've found myself ploughing through a bottle of wine alone, but I feel I should avoid that, so I tend to arrange to meet people in a bar. Thinking about it, my local has replaced the sitting room, because the sitting room means being alone. I'm embarrassed to say, I do sometimes have a drink before I go out, though, to put me in a better mood when I get there.'</p> <p>Significantly, Gillian's embarrassment relates to her private consumption of alcohol, rather than what she drinks when she's in public. Sandra Farrell, a Manchester-based alcohol counsellor, also says it's a common misconception that we always associate social drinking with friends.</p> <p>'Research shows we tend to drink more when we're anxious, so you're more likely to exceed sensible limits with strangers than friends.

'I was probably hungover for years, which ironically made work seem even tougher.'

      "body": "<p>If you're as well organised as my mum, you'll probably have made your mince pies and Christmas cake weeks ago. If so, you may now have a stash of leftover dried fruit tucked away in your kitchen awaiting the moment when you next feel peckish. Indeed, dried fruit can last weeks if it is stored properly, which means you can buy it in bulk without worrying about it going to waste. Small packets of dried fruit are also easy to carry around in a handbag, satchel or briefcase so that they are conveniently to hand when you need an energising and nutritious snack between meals.</p> <p>The nutritional qualities of dried fruit, such as Medjool dates, Agen prunes, Lexia raisins and apricots or pears, equal those of their fresh counterparts, although the benefits to health offered by fresh and dried fruit vary. Most notably, because most of the water has been removed, dried fruit contains a higher concentration of energy-giving fructose (fruit sugar) per mouthful than fresh fruit. Unlike a chocolate, sweet or sugary biscuit, which gives an instant buzz, but then causes your mood and energy levels to crash, the boost you derive from dried fruit is normally gentle and, because it also contains fibre, it enables your blood-sugar level to remain stable.</p> <p>Dried fruit therefore provides a sustained energy source, even more so if you remember to drink water between mouthfuls, because fluid helps the cellulose in the fruit's fibrous cell walls to swell, thereby providing a barrier that has an inhibitive effect on the rate at which sugar is absorbed. The fibre in dried fruit can cushion the stomach's absorption of fat, too, so if you're off to a Christmas party where you suspect that rich or fatty canap\u00e9s may be served, eat a few dried fruits beforehand. This strategy will also slow down the rate at which your body absorbs alcohol and will help to keep your blood-sugar level stable, making a hangover the next day either less likely or less fierce, depending on how exuberantly you have been celebrating.</p> <p>Because fibre stimulates stretch receptors within the stomach wall to send signals to the hypothalamus, the sector of the brain which registers fullness, eating dried fruit can additionally discourage you from eating too many fatty or high-calorie foods. The greater the variety of tastes, textures and other sensory stimuli a meal contains, the greater the number of satiety signals your hypothalamus receives, with the result that you will feel satisfyingly replete more quickly. Teaming dried fruit with cheese, for instance, will increase your feelings of satiety through the contrasts in taste and texture, as well as the fibre in the dried fruit.</p> <p>Although eating dried fruit in moderation can help keep you trim, don't be tempted to binge, as a large intake of fructose can not only cause a dramatic sugar surge, but can saddle you with unwanted calories. The high concentration of fruit sugar can adversely affect sensitive digestions, causing cramps, pain, wind and sometimes diarrhoea. This is because the gut doesn't appreciate being exposed to large concentrations of sugar, which prompt its muscle walls to react abnormally, the fluid balance within its cells to change and its bacterial culture to become disturbed. All in all, it's best to stick to a couple of pieces of dried fruit at a time.</p> <p>At this time of year, when the central heating is at full blast and we are likely to turn to alcohol and caffeine to warm us up, we can easily become dehydrated, causing the bowel to behave sluggishly and become constipated. If you are starting to feel like a dried prune, let the real thing come to your rescue: along with figs, prunes - either as they come or soaked and then pur\u00e9ed - are particularly effective laxatives. Providing a gentler, tastier and healthier alternative to the laxatives found at pharmacies, a couple of large spoonfuls of pur\u00e9ed dried fruit can stimulate even young children's bowels.</p> <p>Dried fruit also contains B vitamins, which help to maintain a healthy nervous system, and magnesium, which helps the body release energy, build strong bones, teeth and muscles and absorb other minerals, such as calcium (found in dried fruits such as figs and apricots, as is zinc, the infection-fighting nutrient). Figs, raisins, apricots and prunes all contain iron, too, so they can make a valuable contribution to the health of your blood and immune system, as well as encouraging growth.</p> <p>When shopping for dried fruit, bear the following in mind. First, opt for organic dried fruits rather than those that have been exposed to sulphur dioxide (SO &lt;-&gt;2 <!---->), which can provoke digestive problems and breathlessness in some people. This is used to prolong the shelf life, as well as to give a brighter colour (an untreated apricot is quite dark, while its treated counterpart is bright orange). Second, take the moisture content into consideration. Some have been dried so savagely that they resemble rock-hard, shrivelled bullets, and although you can soak them (a process that makes Hunza apricots particularly delicious), this negates the convenience factor of their otherwise easy transportability. Choose dried fruit that looks as though it has a little 'give' under the skin, and this will in turn give you the greatest nutritional rewards.</p> <p>\u0095 Jane Clarke is a registered dietician and author of the Bodyfoods series of books.</p>",

Most notably, because most of the water has been removed, dried fruit contains a higher concentration of energy-giving fructose (fruit sugar) per mouthful than fresh fruit. Unlike a chocolate, sweet or sugary biscuit, which gives an instant buzz, but then causes your mood and energy levels to crash, the boost you derive from dried fruit is normally gentle and, because it also contains fibre, it enables your blood-sugar level to remain stable. Dried fruit therefore provides a sustained energy source, even more so if you remember to drink water between mouthfuls, because fluid helps the cellulose in the fruit's fibrous cell walls to swell, thereby providing a barrier that has an inhibitive effect on the rate at which sugar is absorbed. The fibre in dried fruit can cushion the stomach's absorption of fat, too, so if you're off to a Christmas party where you suspect that rich or fatty canap\u00e9s may be served, eat a few dried fruits beforehand. This strategy will also slow down the rate at which your body absorbs alcohol and will help to keep your blood-sugar level stable, making a hangover the next day either less likely or less fierce, depending on how exuberantly you have been celebrating. Because fibre stimulates stretch receptors within the stomach wall to send signals to the hypothalamus, the sector of the brain which registers fullness, eating dried fruit can additionally discourage you from eating too many fatty or high-calorie foods. The greater the variety of tastes, textures and other sensory stimuli a meal contains, the greater the number of satiety signals your hypothalamus receives, with the result that you will feel satisfyingly replete more quickly. Teaming dried fruit with cheese, for instance, will increase your feelings of satiety through the contrasts in taste and texture, as well as the fibre in the dried fruit. Although eating dried fruit in moderation can help keep you trim, don't be tempted to binge, as a large intake of fructose can not only cause a dramatic sugar surge, but can saddle you with unwanted calories. The high concentration of fruit sugar can adversely affect sensitive digestions, causing cramps, pain, wind and sometimes diarrhoea. This is because the gut doesn't appreciate being exposed to large concentrations of sugar, which prompt its muscle walls to react abnormally, the fluid balance within its cells to change and its bacterial culture to become disturbed. All in all, it's best to stick to a couple of pieces of dried fruit at a time. At this time of year, when the central heating is at full blast and we are likely to turn to alcohol and caffeine to warm us up, we can easily become dehydrated, causing the bowel to behave sluggishly and become constipated. If you are starting to feel like a dried prune, let the real thing come to your rescue: along with figs, prunes - either as they come or soaked and then pur\u00e9ed - are particularly effective laxatives. Providing a gentler, tastier and healthier alternative to the laxatives found at pharmacies, a couple of large spoonfuls of pur\u00e9ed dried fruit can stimulate even young children's bowels. Dried fruit also contains B vitamins, which help to maintain a healthy nervous system, and magnesium, which helps the body release energy, build strong bones, teeth and muscles and absorb other minerals, such as calcium (found in dried fruits such as figs and apricots, as is zinc, the infection-fighting nutrient). Figs, raisins, apricots and prunes all contain iron, too, so they can make a valuable contribution to the health of your blood and immune system, as well as encouraging growth. When shopping for dried fruit, bear the following in mind. First, opt for organic dried fruits rather than those that have been exposed to sulphur dioxide (SO &lt;-&gt;2 ), which can provoke digestive problems and breathlessness in some people. This is used to prolong the shelf life, as well as to give a brighter colour (an untreated apricot is quite dark, while its treated counterpart is bright orange). Second, take the moisture content into consideration. Some have been dried so savagely that they resemble rock-hard, shrivelled bullets, and although you can soak them (a process that makes Hunza apricots particularly delicious), this negates the convenience factor of their otherwise easy transportability. Choose dried fruit that looks as though it has a little 'give' under the skin, and this will in turn give you the greatest nutritional rewards. \u0095 Jane Clarke is a registered dietician and author of the Bodyfoods series of books.",

Maybe it's better that way, that the glories of the bomp belong not to an individual or two, but to a cavalcade of creators. You didn't need instruments, just a few guys who could sing, a stairwell for an amplifier and a dream of following heroes like The Inkspots or the Mills Brothers, or just of impressing the girls from the next block.</p> <p>Just as some people fall in love with 1950s American cars, I fell for doo-wop, and for much the same reasons. It was flashy, ridiculous, and dated, but extravagant and beautiful (doo-wop groups often named themselves after cars - The Cadillacs, The Impalas, The Bel-Airs). And just as the motor industry has never indulged in chrome and fins in the same way, so pop has never equalled doo-wop's surreal Esperanto.</p> <p>What was the bomp saying? That hoodlums, too, had poetry in their soul, that syrupy sentiments and vocal pyrotechnics might articulate a nobler romanticism and sweatier passion than the bland jingles of Tin Pan Alley. Its golden era, in the mid-50s, favoured slushy ballads such as 'Earth Angel' by The Penguins and 'The Great Pretender' by The Platters, though there was always room for the deeply crazed, such as 'Rang Tang Ding Dong (I Am A Japanese Sandman)' by The Cellos, which was last heard on the soundtrack to Bring Out Your Dead, Martin Scorsese being a doo-wop diehard. </p> <p>Motown and The Beatles owed it big-time and without The Regents's 'Barbara Ann', The Beach Boys would have likely stayed a barbershop quartet. Today's boy bands and girl groups palely reflect its majesty. But will Westlife ever sing 'Shananana-badoo-dip-dip-dip-boom-boom-doo-wah' in perfect four-part harmony? Nah. </p> <p><b>Do Fries Go With That Shake?</b><br> By Marion McGilvary </p> <p>The fat life's a bitch and then you diet. Every morning I roll over in bed, the aftershock of my arse just a fraction of a second behind the rest of me, and think: OK, no bread. No butter. No starch. No sugar. No cashew nuts. No olives. Remember, you don't even like olives. I make elaborate dietary rules with the zeal of a Rabbinical scholar, and then spend hours looking for loopholes: no drinking. Well, no drinking at lunch. Unless there's champagne. No wine - unless it is a fine red, or a white burgundy. And then only one glass. Or maybe one each, if it's rude to refuse.</p> <p>But the curves have their compensations. At last, I've something worth getting off my chest. And my new cleavage acts as a reliable decoy for everything else further south. Rather than love handles, I have footholds with rest areas and scenic outposts. This, then, is why they call it a balcony bra. But I've discovered that the reason women take refuge in serious underwiring is really nothing to do with display. What you are really trying to do is strap the damn things down. </p> <p>I know, I know, the answer is simple - lose weight, eat less, drink water, exercise. But, sadly, I am a woman with large appetites. </p> <p><b>Ever Fallen In Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)? </b><br> By Mariella Frostrup</p> <p>Well, let's face it, that's a rhetorical question if ever I heard one. Surely the definition of 'love' is a completely illogical attraction to someone you have no business being in the same country as let alone the same bed? The million-dollar question is have you ever fallen in love with anyone you should have? I did. </p> <p>I had a boyfriend once who baked me cakes, picked up my dry-cleaning, told me every morning as I opened my eyes that he loved me. Sent flowers because he felt like it not because he ought to. Talked to my mother when she called and tidied up my clothes strewn throughout the flat. </p> <p>I wanted to kill him. Why on earth would you want all that devotion when you can pine away for the mysterious man in the corner, earn detective stripes during subsequent weeks by uncovering every detail about his life, his friends and most importantly the places he frequents. Through sheer perseverance you finally force him to notice you. You listen understandingly while he tells you that he's not looking for a relationship, and then force him into one. The triumph is invariably followed by the discovery that what you mistook for enigma was actually a near comatic state brought on by hard drugs, heavy drinking and a brain gone numb through dating too many teenagers. Nevertheless, you stick to him like a barnacle and forgive his appalling digressions, because it's your fault. </p> <p>He told you he didn't want a 'serious' relationship; just because he moved in with you three months later is no reason to disbelieve him. Three years later, you're still trying to turn him into the perfect boyfriend who bakes you cakes, tells you daily that he loves you, tidies up your clothes and talks to your mother on the phone for hours on end. Finally, it all gets too painful and tiring, so you pack up and leave. A few weeks at home licking your wounds and your girlfriends force you to stop grieving and go out. </p> <p>You see a mysterious enigmatic man pretending to ignore the adoring women draped all over him and bingo. You're in love all over again!</p> <p><b>(How Much Is) That Doggie In The Window?</b><br> By Martin Love</p> <p>I always thought I'd have two children. I have one brother and my wife has a sister, so after the birth of our second child I thought that would be that. I drew a line under my baby-making days (and nights) and even considered a vasectomy - though a combination of cowardice and prudery prevented me from becoming less of a man. </p> <p>But strange whisperings started emanating from the family-planning department of our home (my wife to you and me). Two was too neat, apparently. It made us look as if we didn't really like children, apparently. And then the clincher - her best friend was suddenly pregnant, with number three. Three was now the new two point four.</p> <p>At first I was able to dismiss the murmurings. But they grew, until eventually it became clear my wife would feel incomplete until another fluffy-headed creature entered our lives. I resorted to emergency plan B.</p> <p>In parenting circles, it is commonly known that the arrival of a puppy is a signal to the wider community that you have had your last child. 'Did you see that the Smiths have got the sweetest new dog?' 'Oh, really! So they're stopping at three are they?' </p> <p>I bought the local free-ads paper and started scanning the 'dogs for sale' column. Before we knew it, we were all in the car, driving north to the home of Poppy the pointer and her good friend Alfie.</p> <p>The arrival of the fifth member of our family wasn't as agonising as the third and fourth, but it wasn't without pain. She cost \u00a3250 for a start, but taking her from under the unsuspecting snouts of Poppy and Alfie left a deeper hurt which made us feel like home-breakers rather than home-builders. We're dog burglars.</p> <p>But Winifred is already one of the family. And as for being a baby-substitute\u0085 well, my wife doesn't seem to worry about giving out the wrong signals.</p> <p><b>Do You Remember The First Time?</b><br> By Rowan Pelling</p> <p>What sort of damn fool question is that? Even advanced-staged amnesiacs with memory gaps so large you could pothole through them remember the day they lost the cherry - and whom they lost it to. The memory is even stronger for those of us who didn't surrender our virtue in the traditional manner - as an act of alcohol-fuelled teenage rebellion at a party, or on a Cornish beach.</p> <p>I was grimly determined that I would never drop my knickers for some pimply adolescent whose balls had only just plummeted and who'd return the favour by telling his mates that I was easy, or, worse still, ugly and easy: a 'monster-munch' (Sevenoaks schoolboy slang circa 1985).</p> <p>I had an older and more debonair model in mind. Someone who entertained a vague notion that sex should be enjoyable for both parties. Someone who combined the qualities of Darcy, Rochester and Byron in one smouldering package. Frankly, when you consider my expectations, I'm amazed I managed to get laid at all. </p> <p>I was 20 when I finally divested myself of my virginity. Not to one of my university contemporaries, but to a hawkish artist in north Oxford who was 12 years older than me. He asked me to sit for him, naked, and with the minimum of fuss I slipped from his studio into his bed. It was an entirely pleasurable experience, and at the time I thought myself in love. In the morning he served up boiled eggs then packed me off to college (a performance we repeated several times over). It set a useful precedent because forever afterwards I have associated sex with art and breakfast - gratification on all levels.</p> <p><b>How Do You Speak To An Angel? </b><br> By Stuart Husband</p> <p>My mother had a pathological fear of 'causing a fuss'. That's why, by the time she was persuaded to get herself to a hospital, the cancer was beyond inoperable. I barely had time to make it back from the Far East before it consumed her. It may have been merciful, but the brevity of her annihilation - for that's what it felt like - left us stunned and incredulous.</p> <p>I went to a medium some months later; there was a dull ache in my head that I couldn't shift. Nesta lived on a Brookside-style estate in Finchley. She was white-haired and smelled faintly of violets - one of my mum's favourite flowers. Her trim little house was adorned with certificates from various psychic associations. She asked me to bring something that belonged to the person I wished to contact. All I had was an old photo of Mum, which she held picture-side-down, stroking the underside of it with her thumb. Ah yes, she said, with no preamble. Your mum's passed on. I can see her, she said. She looks like she did as a young girl, and she's with Bob, Arthur, Jane, Joan and Rusty. </p> <p>I didn't recognise any of the names, and I was starting to nod out in the fumes coming from Nesta's gas fire. Then she said, your mother's been back to see you and your sisters. She named my sisters. She said, your eldest sister's marriage broke up, but don't worry, she'll find love again (it had and she has). She said, your niece plays the piano like your mother did. She wants her to keep it up (she did but, sadly, she hasn't). She said, your mum wants you to nurture your writing talent (I've tried).</p> <p>The air in the room seemed to have thinned. </p> <p>I could hear my heart pumping. Rearranging my limbs seemed to take a gigantic effort. Nesta said, then there's your dad. Your mum's very worried because he keeps that cup of water by the back door to throw over next door's cats when they come into his precious garden and he hasn't done it recently, even though the cats have been in (he did and he hadn't). She said, that's how she knows how upset he is. He does this a lot, doesn't he, she said, smoothing her hair back over her ears. Yes, I said. Well, she said, your mum will stand behind his chair and take his hands when he does that. He'll feel her presence. It'll comfort him.</p> <p>I said, where is she now? Nesta said, in a part of her life where she was carefree and safe. I said, why would she come back? Nesta said, those who pass on feel as much pain as those left behind. She needs to see you as much as you need to feel she's still around. That need won't ever go away, but it'll diminish over time. I left feeling dazed but oddly comforted. The ache softened.</p> <p>Later I asked my gran about Bob, Arthur, Jane and Joan. They turned out to be mum's best friends from her Devon childhood. Rusty was a dog from a local farm who used to play with them. They roamed all over the village, said Gran. They were happy as mice. I'm still a sceptic, albeit one that admits the inexplicable. But now when I think of Mum, I don't see her watering eyes as she coughs up blood in the morning, or her wince of pain as she takes my hand in hospital and fights for breath; I see her running through a Devon churchyard, feeling immortal, shouting at the top of her pristine lungs. And I'll always be grateful to Nesta for that.</p> <p><b>Who's Sorry Now? </b><br>By John Cale <br> (Recalling the end of Velvet Underground)</p> <p>Not me. I was sure we had done whatever we could. I could sleep like a baby. The Velvet Underground was synonymous with many things other than its members and their proclivities, precisely because it erected its music as a barricade. It still hides behind it. </p> <p>From its inception in Andy Warhol's Factory in 1964, everything in the Velvets was shared (except the songs, which were on a case by case). The lyrics came straight from the subconscious and we had divined a theorem behind this to blend the hypnotic viola drone of my first American band, the Dream Syndicate, with a none-too-benign interest in subliminal advertising. But after the last reunion tour no one was hypnotised anymore - especially us. Collaboration was dead and the waters were poisoned. How happy was I to leave? </p> <p>I was catatonic with relief. If a personal injury attorney had heard our gripes, where would he start? He called you what? And you lost how much libido? And which part of 'fuck you' exactly did you not understand?</p> <p>I had hoped for greater things. Perhaps a Velvet Underground Golf Tourney - teeing off at midnight with black balls on Dartmoor; or a Test Match in the dark with fluorescent balls and wickets\u0085 anything but the mediocrity we had become. </p> <p>Returning to my solo work was the only sensible answer. Sadder still, it was the possibility of a last-minute apology from Lou [Reed] - looking like a hustle - that made walking away inevitable. Still, the years and days spent in the 'frolic' held me in their grip for a long time, but a scrutiny of the massacre that personal ambition can wreak revealed a centre as mysterious and menacing as any Algerian souk.</p> <p><b>Should I Stay Or Should I Go?</b><br> By Miranda Sawyer</p> <p>The tricky time is 3am. Up until that time, you can fool yourself that you'll recover: that if you go home, drink tea, sleep deep, then everything will be all right, your soul remain unblackened, your mind unscarred, your health unimpaired, your reputation sully-free. </p> <p>After three, it doesn't really matter. Half past five, seven o'clock, a quarter past Tuesday; the damage is done. Go or stay, it won't make much difference in the morning. So, let's stay! But now that I am older, and drug-shy, then staying brings other considerations. My fidget-minded, eager-to-move drunken state does not always match my companions' moods, and vice versa. So, go, then\u0085 But if I go too early, I'll be rattling round the sitting room, searching for videos, making late-night phonecalls, frantic, frustrated. Yet if I stay too long, my eyes will bleed from boredom with another cokehead's bilious rant, another E-freak's surreality, another drunk's tedious bluster. (And yes, that could well be my own.) Should I stay? I mean, I might, I just might have the night of my life. Should I go? It's not looking that likely\u0085 It's 2.55am. What do you reckon?</p> <p><b>Why Does A Man Have To Be Strong?</b><br> By Richard Benson</p> <p>Best ask the ladies. They change their minds about this so often that the modern male, fumbling with their feelings like a teenage boy with a bra strap, can't even hope to keep up. Modern women have told modern men they want openness. Sensitivity. Vulnerability even, with the occasional tear dropped in. </p> <p>But among their female friends they sometimes admit something different altogether; that sensitivity and vulnerability only really work when they're teased out of an otherwise strong, traditionally masculine man. There are those who will tell you that in an age of car-buying, beer-quaffing woman and face-cleansing, Beckhamesque males, there is little sense of men having to be strong. They're wrong. 'A man who isn't sure of himself isn't sexy,' said one marketresearcher's focus groupee this year; suggesting, surely, that the reason that a man still has to be strong is the oldest and most common reason for anything - ie, getting a shag. I don't expect the girls to agree, though.</p> <p><b>How Do You Sleep?</b><br> By Barbara Ellen</p> <p>Insomnia is the cat burglar of afflictions - striking without warning, at the dead of night, stealing away everything you hold dear. Your time, your energy, your tomorrows. Lying in the dark, staring insanely - at the ceiling, the floor, the walls, the black void that used to be your life. Come morning, we are the walking, talking undead. Vampires without portfolio. Zombies with workstations. Hollow-eyed, twitchy, caffeine-dependent messes of humanity who nod off at our desks. I've tried everything. Not drinking coffee after lunchtime. Not drinking coffee at all. Slurping down milky drinks at midnight. Emptying my mind of all the vile detritus of daily life, and instead 'visualising' something 'restful' and 'pleasant' - say a sparkly fountain or a field full of bunny rabbits. It makes no odds. </p> <p>It seems that however much an insomniac strives to be 'relaxed', counting sheep invariably turns into counting problems, nursing grievances, giving people what for. I've had some of the biggest, nastiest arguments of my life while lying alone and sleepless in the dark. Unlike real life, I haven't lost one yet. Sleep deprivation is still used as a torture in some countries, and with insomnia, it is as if we are our own torturers. It's difficult to describe to non-sufferers how debilitating it is. 'Just get some sleep,' they say airily, in a way they would never tell someone in a wheelchair to 'just walk it off'. That's another downside of insomnia - whereas you are, shall we say, wide awake to your nightly agonies, the rest of the world seems fast asleep. </p> <p><b>What Have They Done To The Rain?</b><br> By Robin Mckie</p> <p>Quite a lot, really. After decades of pumping clouds of sulphur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, the world's industrial nations have created clouds so acidic they could turn litmus tests into red-light districts. The heating of our atmosphere with has produced climatic mayhem. In consecutive years, the south of England is either turned into a version of the Gobi desert, or a vast, flooded basin that rivals the Everglades. Or to put it another way, a hard rain's gonna fall\u0085</p> <p><b>If I Said You Had A Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me?</b><br> By Euan Ferguson</p> <p>Almost definitely not, although it's still not the crassest chat-up line of all time. That honour must go to one of England's best living poets, a notorious philanderer who once leant furtively across the table at a dinner party, his hand resting casually under the table on the knee of a lady not his wife, and tried to charm her with the phrase: 'I put it to you that your c*** is on fire\u0085' This practically unbeatable mix of crudeness and pomposity led Jonathan Coe to immortalise the line in his novel The House of Sleep, where it should probably stay forever.</p> <p>There is, in fact, no real excuse for using chat-up lines these days. First, if a man and a woman want to sleep with each other from the start, they will know this instantly and subsequent conversation is a mere bagatelle, a clearing of the throat; unless the man actually attempts to enrich such conversation by moving too early to talk of coprophilia, or works in marketing, the fix is in and nature will take its happy course.</p> <p>It's all in the confidence, the delivery, the eyes and the ability to listen to the answer, and come back quickly, and keep listening for a long time afterwards. Pericles's funeral oration or Homer Simpson's Beer Song, it doesn't matter: if women like the sass, they will, surprisingly often, ignore the stringwarts. (The other scenario - when the woman is more desperate for the man - is hardly worth bothering about. It's obvious from the start, or the Mancunian accent will be a giveaway.)</p> <p>Perhaps there was a time when even the most rapt and magnetised couple had to break the ice somehow, with a 'Come here often?' or 'Which end of the bath do you sit at?'; back in those innocent days, before the silent, violent honesty of direct eye contact gave the game away in seconds.</p> <p>But today, nobody is stupid enough to use chat-up lines with any degree of seriousness. Women know they're cheesy, men know they're cheesy, and the only decision, if you're going to use them, is do you go for simple cheddar, such as 'My name is Euan. Remember that, because you'll be screaming it later'? Or for gorgonzola? 'Well, here I am. What were your other two wishes?' Do you follow the ballsaching Michael Douglas line to Catherine Zeta-Jones ('I want to be the father of your children') by actually being dirty-cheesy? 'Nice legs... what time do they open?' or the quite fantastically unsuccessful old Scots favourite: 'D'ye like chicken?' ('Yes'). 'Well, suck this - it's foul.'</p> <p>You might as well ask, simply, 'Do you mind if I chat you up for a while?' As long as you look like you like her, and look like you like yourself. With these two sorted, you could probably even risk the Bellamy Brothers.</p>",

By Neil Spencer Exactly who put the bomp in the bomp-bomp-bomp, the ram in the rama-dama-ding-dong and the oop in the oop-shoop, and the wop in doo-wop, remains a mystery mired in the greasy annals of teenage pre-history, back around the late 1940s and early 1950s. Maybe it's better that way, that the glories of the bomp belong not to an individual or two, but to a cavalcade of creators. You didn't need instruments, just a few guys who could sing, a stairwell for an amplifier and a dream of following heroes like The Inkspots or the Mills Brothers, or just of impressing the girls from the next block. Just as some people fall in love with 1950s American cars, I fell for doo-wop, and for much the same reasons. It was flashy, ridiculous, and dated, but extravagant and beautiful (doo-wop groups often named themselves after cars - The Cadillacs, The Impalas, The Bel-Airs). And just as the motor industry has never indulged in chrome and fins in the same way, so pop has never equalled doo-wop's surreal Esperanto. What was the bomp saying? That hoodlums, too, had poetry in their soul, that syrupy sentiments and vocal pyrotechnics might articulate a nobler romanticism and sweatier passion than the bland jingles of Tin Pan Alley. Its golden era, in the mid-50s, favoured slushy ballads such as 'Earth Angel' by The Penguins and 'The Great Pretender' by The Platters, though there was always room for the deeply crazed, such as 'Rang Tang Ding Dong (I Am A Japanese Sandman)' by The Cellos, which was last heard on the soundtrack to Bring Out Your Dead, Martin Scorsese being a doo-wop diehard. Motown and The Beatles owed it big-time and without The Regents's 'Barbara Ann', The Beach Boys would have likely stayed a barbershop quartet. Today's boy bands and girl groups palely reflect its majesty. But will Westlife ever sing 'Shananana-badoo-dip-dip-dip-boom-boom-doo-wah' in perfect four-part harmony? Nah. Do Fries Go With That Shake? By Marion McGilvary The fat life's a bitch and then you diet.

But I've discovered that the reason women take refuge in serious underwiring is really nothing to do with display. What you are really trying to do is strap the damn things down. I know, I know, the answer is simple - lose weight, eat less, drink water, exercise. But, sadly, I am a woman with large appetites. Ever Fallen In Love (With Someone You Shouldn't've)? By Mariella Frostrup Well, let's face it, that's a rhetorical question if ever I heard one. Surely the definition of 'love' is a completely illogical attraction to someone you have no business being in the same country as let alone the same bed? The million-dollar question is have you ever fallen in love with anyone you should have? I did. I had a boyfriend once who baked me cakes, picked up my dry-cleaning, told me every morning as I opened my eyes that he loved me. Sent flowers because he felt like it not because he ought to. Talked to my mother when she called and tidied up my clothes strewn throughout the flat. I wanted to kill him. Why on earth would you want all that devotion when you can pine away for the mysterious man in the corner, earn detective stripes during subsequent weeks by uncovering every detail about his life, his friends and most importantly the places he frequents. Through sheer perseverance you finally force him to notice you. You listen understandingly while he tells you that he's not looking for a relationship, and then force him into one. The triumph is invariably followed by the discovery that what you mistook for enigma was actually a near comatic state brought on by hard drugs, heavy drinking and a brain gone numb through dating too many teenagers. Nevertheless, you stick to him like a barnacle and forgive his appalling digressions, because it's your fault. He told you he didn't want a 'serious' relationship; just because he moved in with you three months later is no reason to disbelieve him. Three years later, you're still trying to turn him into the perfect boyfriend who bakes you cakes, tells you daily that he loves you, tidies up your clothes and talks to your mother on the phone for hours on end. Finally, it all gets too painful and tiring, so you pack up and leave. A few weeks at home licking your wounds and your girlfriends force you to stop grieving and go out. You see a mysterious enigmatic man pretending to ignore the adoring women draped all over him and bingo. You're in love all over again! (How Much Is) That Doggie In The Window? By Martin Love I always thought I'd have two children. I have one brother and my wife has a sister, so after the birth of our second child I thought that would be that. I drew a line under my baby-making days (and nights) and even considered a vasectomy - though a combination of cowardice and prudery prevented me from becoming less of a man. But strange whisperings started emanating from the family-planning department of our home (my wife to you and me). Two was too neat, apparently. It made us look as if we didn't really like children, apparently. And then the clincher - her best friend was suddenly pregnant, with number three. Three was now the new two point four. At first I was able to dismiss the murmurings. But they grew, until eventually it became clear my wife would feel incomplete until another fluffy-headed creature entered our lives. I resorted to emergency plan B. In parenting circles, it is commonly known that the arrival of a puppy is a signal to the wider community that you have had your last child. 'Did you see that the Smiths have got the sweetest new dog?' 'Oh, really! So they're stopping at three are they?' I bought the local free-ads paper and started scanning the 'dogs for sale' column. Before we knew it, we were all in the car, driving north to the home of Poppy the pointer and her good friend Alfie. The arrival of the fifth member of our family wasn't as agonising as the third and fourth, but it wasn't without pain. She cost \u00a3250 for a start, but taking her from under the unsuspecting snouts of Poppy and Alfie left a deeper hurt which made us feel like home-breakers rather than home-builders. We're dog burglars. But Winifred is already one of the family. And as for being a baby-substitute\u0085 well, my wife doesn't seem to worry about giving out the wrong signals. Do You Remember The First Time? By Rowan Pelling What sort of damn fool question is that? Even advanced-staged amnesiacs with memory gaps so large you could pothole through them remember the day they lost the cherry - and whom they lost it to. The memory is even stronger for those of us who didn't surrender our virtue in the traditional manner - as an act of alcohol-fuelled teenage rebellion at a party, or on a Cornish beach. I was grimly determined that I would never drop my knickers for some pimply adolescent whose balls had only just plummeted and who'd return the favour by telling his mates that I was easy, or, worse still, ugly and easy: a 'monster-munch' (Sevenoaks schoolboy slang circa 1985). I had an older and more debonair model in mind. Someone who entertained a vague notion that sex should be enjoyable for both parties. Someone who combined the qualities of Darcy, Rochester and Byron in one smouldering package. Frankly, when you consider my expectations, I'm amazed I managed to get laid at all. I was 20 when I finally divested myself of my virginity. Not to one of my university contemporaries, but to a hawkish artist in north Oxford who was 12 years older than me. He asked me to sit for him, naked, and with the minimum of fuss I slipped from his studio into his bed. It was an entirely pleasurable experience, and at the time I thought myself in love. In the morning he served up boiled eggs then packed me off to college (a performance we repeated several times over). It set a useful precedent because forever afterwards I have associated sex with art and breakfast - gratification on all levels. How Do You Speak To An Angel? By Stuart Husband My mother had a pathological fear of 'causing a fuss'. That's why, by the time she was persuaded to get herself to a hospital, the cancer was beyond inoperable. I barely had time to make it back from the Far East before it consumed her. It may have been merciful, but the brevity of her annihilation - for that's what it felt like - left us stunned and incredulous. I went to a medium some months later; there was a dull ache in my head that I couldn't shift. Nesta lived on a Brookside-style estate in Finchley. She was white-haired and smelled faintly of violets - one of my mum's favourite flowers. Her trim little house was adorned with certificates from various psychic associations. She asked me to bring something that belonged to the person I wished to contact. All I had was an old photo of Mum, which she held picture-side-down, stroking the underside of it with her thumb. Ah yes, she said, with no preamble. Your mum's passed on. I can see her, she said. She looks like she did as a young girl, and she's with Bob, Arthur, Jane, Joan and Rusty. I didn't recognise any of the names, and I was starting to nod out in the fumes coming from Nesta's gas fire. Then she said, your mother's been back to see you and your sisters. She named my sisters. She said, your eldest sister's marriage broke up, but don't worry, she'll find love again (it had and she has). She said, your niece plays the piano like your mother did. She wants her to keep it up (she did but, sadly, she hasn't). She said, your mum wants you to nurture your writing talent (I've tried). The air in the room seemed to have thinned. I could hear my heart pumping. Rearranging my limbs seemed to take a gigantic effort. Nesta said, then there's your dad. Your mum's very worried because he keeps that cup of water by the back door to throw over next door's cats when they come into his precious garden and he hasn't done it recently, even though the cats have been in (he did and he hadn't). She said, that's how she knows how upset he is. He does this a lot, doesn't he, she said, smoothing her hair back over her ears. Yes, I said. Well, she said, your mum will stand behind his chair and take his hands when he does that. He'll feel her presence. It'll comfort him. I said, where is she now? Nesta said, in a part of her life where she was carefree and safe. I said, why would she come back? Nesta said, those who pass on feel as much pain as those left behind. She needs to see you as much as you need to feel she's still around. That need won't ever go away, but it'll diminish over time. I left feeling dazed but oddly comforted. The ache softened. Later I asked my gran about Bob, Arthur, Jane and Joan. They turned out to be mum's best friends from her Devon childhood. Rusty was a dog from a local farm who used to play with them. They roamed all over the village, said Gran. They were happy as mice. I'm still a sceptic, albeit one that admits the inexplicable. But now when I think of Mum, I don't see her watering eyes as she coughs up blood in the morning, or her wince of pain as she takes my hand in hospital and fights for breath; I see her running through a Devon churchyard, feeling immortal, shouting at the top of her pristine lungs. And I'll always be grateful to Nesta for that. Who's Sorry Now? By John Cale (Recalling the end of Velvet Underground) Not me. I was sure we had done whatever we could. I could sleep like a baby. The Velvet Underground was synonymous with many things other than its members and their proclivities, precisely because it erected its music as a barricade. It still hides behind it. From its inception in Andy Warhol's Factory in 1964, everything in the Velvets was shared (except the songs, which were on a case by case). The lyrics came straight from the subconscious and we had divined a theorem behind this to blend the hypnotic viola drone of my first American band, the Dream Syndicate, with a none-too-benign interest in subliminal advertising. But after the last reunion tour no one was hypnotised anymore - especially us. Collaboration was dead and the waters were poisoned. How happy was I to leave? I was catatonic with relief. If a personal injury attorney had heard our gripes, where would he start? He called you what? And you lost how much libido? And which part of 'fuck you' exactly did you not understand? I had hoped for greater things. Perhaps a Velvet Underground Golf Tourney - teeing off at midnight with black balls on Dartmoor; or a Test Match in the dark with fluorescent balls and wickets\u0085 anything but the mediocrity we had become. Returning to my solo work was the only sensible answer. Sadder still, it was the possibility of a last-minute apology from Lou [Reed] - looking like a hustle - that made walking away inevitable. Still, the years and days spent in the 'frolic' held me in their grip for a long time, but a scrutiny of the massacre that personal ambition can wreak revealed a centre as mysterious and menacing as any Algerian souk. Should I Stay Or Should I Go? By Miranda Sawyer The tricky time is 3am. Up until that time, you can fool yourself that you'll recover: that if you go home, drink tea, sleep deep, then everything will be all right, your soul remain unblackened, your mind unscarred, your health unimpaired, your reputation sully-free. After three, it doesn't really matter. Half past five, seven o'clock, a quarter past Tuesday; the damage is done. Go or stay, it won't make much difference in the morning. So, let's stay! But now that I am older, and drug-shy, then staying brings other considerations. My fidget-minded, eager-to-move drunken state does not always match my companions' moods, and vice versa. So, go, then\u0085 But if I go too early, I'll be rattling round the sitting room, searching for videos, making late-night phonecalls, frantic, frustrated. Yet if I stay too long, my eyes will bleed from boredom with another cokehead's bilious rant, another E-freak's surreality, another drunk's tedious bluster. (And yes, that could well be my own.) Should I stay? I mean, I might, I just might have the night of my life. Should I go? It's not looking that likely\u0085 It's 2.55am. What do you reckon? Why Does A Man Have To Be Strong? By Richard Benson Best ask the ladies. They change their minds about this so often that the modern male, fumbling with their feelings like a teenage boy with a bra strap, can't even hope to keep up. Modern women have told modern men they want openness. Sensitivity. Vulnerability even, with the occasional tear dropped in. But among their female friends they sometimes admit something different altogether; that sensitivity and vulnerability only really work when they're teased out of an otherwise strong, traditionally masculine man. There are those who will tell you that in an age of car-buying, beer-quaffing woman and face-cleansing, Beckhamesque males, there is little sense of men having to be strong. They're wrong. 'A man who isn't sure of himself isn't sexy,' said one marketresearcher's focus groupee this year; suggesting, surely, that the reason that a man still has to be strong is the oldest and most common reason for anything - ie, getting a shag. I don't expect the girls to agree, though. How Do You Sleep? By Barbara Ellen Insomnia is the cat burglar of afflictions - striking without warning, at the dead of night, stealing away everything you hold dear. Your time, your energy, your tomorrows. Lying in the dark, staring insanely - at the ceiling, the floor, the walls, the black void that used to be your life. Come morning, we are the walking, talking undead. Vampires without portfolio. Zombies with workstations. Hollow-eyed, twitchy, caffeine-dependent messes of humanity who nod off at our desks. I've tried everything. Not drinking coffee after lunchtime. Not drinking coffee at all. Slurping down milky drinks at midnight. Emptying my mind of all the vile detritus of daily life, and instead 'visualising' something 'restful' and 'pleasant' - say a sparkly fountain or a field full of bunny rabbits. It makes no odds. It seems that however much an insomniac strives to be 'relaxed', counting sheep invariably turns into counting problems, nursing grievances, giving people what for. I've had some of the biggest, nastiest arguments of my life while lying alone and sleepless in the dark. Unlike real life, I haven't lost one yet. Sleep deprivation is still used as a torture in some countries, and with insomnia, it is as if we are our own torturers. It's difficult to describe to non-sufferers how debilitating it is. 'Just get some sleep,' they say airily, in a way they would never tell someone in a wheelchair to 'just walk it off'. That's another downside of insomnia - whereas you are, shall we say, wide awake to your nightly agonies, the rest of the world seems fast asleep. What Have They Done To The Rain? By Robin Mckie Quite a lot, really. After decades of pumping clouds of sulphur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere, the world's industrial nations have created clouds so acidic they could turn litmus tests into red-light districts. The heating of our atmosphere with has produced climatic mayhem. In consecutive years, the south of England is either turned into a version of the Gobi desert, or a vast, flooded basin that rivals the Everglades. Or to put it another way, a hard rain's gonna fall\u0085 If I Said You Had A Beautiful Body Would You Hold It Against Me? By Euan Ferguson Almost definitely not, although it's still not the crassest chat-up line of all time. That honour must go to one of England's best living poets, a notorious philanderer who once leant furtively across the table at a dinner party, his hand resting casually under the table on the knee of a lady not his wife, and tried to charm her with the phrase: 'I put it to you that your c*** is on fire\u0085' This practically unbeatable mix of crudeness and pomposity led Jonathan Coe to immortalise the line in his novel The House of Sleep, where it should probably stay forever. There is, in fact, no real excuse for using chat-up lines these days. First, if a man and a woman want to sleep with each other from the start, they will know this instantly and subsequent conversation is a mere bagatelle, a clearing of the throat; unless the man actually attempts to enrich such conversation by moving too early to talk of coprophilia, or works in marketing, the fix is in and nature will take its happy course. It's all in the confidence, the delivery, the eyes and the ability to listen to the answer, and come back quickly, and keep listening for a long time afterwards. Pericles's funeral oration or Homer Simpson's Beer Song, it doesn't matter: if women like the sass, they will, surprisingly often, ignore the stringwarts. (The other scenario - when the woman is more desperate for the man - is hardly worth bothering about. It's obvious from the start, or the Mancunian accent will be a giveaway.) Perhaps there was a time when even the most rapt and magnetised couple had to break the ice somehow, with a 'Come here often?' or 'Which end of the bath do you sit at?'; back in those innocent days, before the silent, violent honesty of direct eye contact gave the game away in seconds. But today, nobody is stupid enough to use chat-up lines with any degree of seriousness. Women know they're cheesy, men know they're cheesy, and the only decision, if you're going to use them, is do you go for simple cheddar, such as 'My name is Euan. Remember that, because you'll be screaming it later'? Or for gorgonzola? 'Well, here I am. What were your other two wishes?' Do you follow the ballsaching Michael Douglas line to Catherine Zeta-Jones ('I want to be the father of your children') by actually being dirty-cheesy? 'Nice legs... what time do they open?' or the quite fantastically unsuccessful old Scots favourite: 'D'ye like chicken?' ('Yes'). 'Well, suck this - it's foul.' You might as well ask, simply, 'Do you mind if I chat you up for a while?' As long as you look like you like her, and look like you like yourself. With these two sorted, you could probably even risk the Bellamy Brothers.",

      "body": "<p>I don't know what you've got planned for New Year's Eve, but I reckon I've got a fair idea. Very little. Last year, you arranged a reunion with 30 of your oldest friends. You made a once-in-a-lifetime trip to the Maldives to say goodbye to the second millennium from a beach on an island that probably won't be here for the end of this millennium's second decade. You lit bonfires, trailing their primal light across Britain. You gathered your family around you in a wind-torn Cornish farmhouse.</p> <p>You stood, fuming, ticketless and slightly drunk at Stratford tube station - well, you did if you were a national newspaper editor waiting to get to your night of nights at the Dome. You got thrillingly, dangerously crushed with three million others in the centre of London. Or you sang 'Auld Lang Syne' as if you'd never heard it before and didn't do the traditional arms-crossing bit because no one had ever dared grab your hand before Tony Blair came along - if you are the Queen, that is.</p> <p>Me? I watched the fireworks from Primrose Hill. They were distant and almost silent, but more than worth the walk. Then I went home for a couple of quiet drinks with a couple of loud friends.</p> <p>Whatever it was, you quite likely did something you'd never done before. That was the Millennium, though, wasn't it? Maybe we were hyped or cajoled. Maybe we just grasped a rare opportunity to step outside the envelopes into which we all wrap and lick and stick ourselves. But that was last year. This year is somewhat different. No one's talking about millions raving on the paving. No one's planning big bashes. Even at this late date, few people seem to have much idea of what - if anything - they'll do. Particularly if my completely unscientific poll is anything to go by.</p> <p>'I actually don't know as yet,' said my first interviewee - single, male, affluent Islington resident, with no children but own car and residual Belfast accent. 'I'll let you know when I do.' I'm still waiting.</p> <p>'Nothing very interesting,' said the second - married, female, west London, with child and own ISDN link. We swapped tales of the traditional British year-ender - of the teenage dreams (inevitably disappointed) we all carry through to adult parties, of people kissed (never the ones we wanted to kiss), of the night's quiet air of despair, of the classic, depressed tenor of New Year's Eve dos: another year over - thank God - and a new one just begun - oh, God.</p> <p>This year? 'A family party,' she said. Now you may not believe this, but she actually sounded enthused by the prospect. Inevitably, I thought of Mrs Patrick Campbell's famous sigh: 'Oh, for the deep, deep peace of the marital bed after the hurly-burly of the chaise longue.'</p> <p>The thought recurred with my next contact - male, married, with small children and transatlantic career. 'Going to see the Burning of the Clocks in Brighton where I now reside. Then going to bed at around three minutes past midnight.'</p> <p>Or how about the next one - male, married, high earner, one child and 'colourful' past. 'As if I know yet. Burying my head under the pillow, probably!'</p> <p>Those who did have plans were somehow overconscious of their modesty. Take this American-born songwriter now resident in Paris, with ambitions to be the next Serge Gainsbourg - his first steps were dreadlocks</p> <p>and a dancer girlfriend. This New Year, he'll be skiing in Canada. Last year, though, that was the big one - a party at Versailles with Russian gangsters. 'This New Year seems quite a let-down,' he admitted.</p> <p>It's the same, perhaps even more so, for his ex-wife - English, north London, with live-in-partner but no offspring. She said she'd be spending New Year's Eve at the computer, finishing off her biography of Serge Gainsbourg.</p> <p>There was a moment, in London at least, when it looked as if it was all going to be different. When Ken Livingstone and Bob Geldof got together to plan a capital night out, there was a feeling abroad that last year's grand spectaculars would become the new norm. For the night that mathematicians, calendar-fans, pedants and sub-editors insist is the real last night of the second millennium, Ken and Bob dreamed their dreams of a giant world city celebration. They even ordered the fireworks, which duly arrived at Tilbury Docks - a couple of weeks after all manner of bureaucrats kiboshed their party.</p> <p>It's been replaced by 'events and activities right across Greater London'. Culture Secretary Chris Smith added - in the authentic deadening tones of a Captain Mainwaring - that 'local authorities have responded magnificently to the challenge'. That is, they've rounded up the usual prospects: beacon lighting; high-street processions culminating in the town park; small-scale laser displays; family based, multicultural firework shows.</p> <p>I made the last one up, by the way - though only by pasting together elements of real shows. Still, it does sound like the time-honoured British New Year's Eve. Say it quiet, it's back and it's proud. And in bed by three minutes past midnight.</p> <p>This survey was conducted over a period of three days in the second week of December. Population was unweighted sample of friends of author who returned his calls and emails.</p>",

You lit bonfires, trailing their primal light across Britain. You gathered your family around you in a wind-torn Cornish farmhouse. You stood, fuming, ticketless and slightly drunk at Stratford tube station - well, you did if you were a national newspaper editor waiting to get to your night of nights at the Dome. You got thrillingly, dangerously crushed with three million others in the centre of London. Or you sang 'Auld Lang Syne' as if you'd never heard it before and didn't do the traditional arms-crossing bit because no one had ever dared grab your hand before Tony Blair came along - if you are the Queen, that is. Me? I watched the fireworks from Primrose Hill. They were distant and almost silent, but more than worth the walk. Then I went home for a couple of quiet drinks with a couple of loud friends. Whatever it was, you quite likely did something you'd never done before. That was the Millennium, though, wasn't it? Maybe we were hyped or cajoled. Maybe we just grasped a rare opportunity to step outside the envelopes into which we all wrap and lick and stick ourselves. But that was last year. This year is somewhat different. No one's talking about millions raving on the paving. No one's planning big bashes. Even at this late date, few people seem to have much idea of what - if anything - they'll do. Particularly if my completely unscientific poll is anything to go by. 'I actually don't know as yet,' said my first interviewee - single, male, affluent Islington resident, with no children but own car and residual Belfast accent. 'I'll let you know when I do.' I'm still waiting. 'Nothing very interesting,' said the second - married, female, west London, with child and own ISDN link. We swapped tales of the traditional British year-ender - of the teenage dreams (inevitably disappointed) we all carry through to adult parties, of people kissed (never the ones we wanted to kiss), of the night's quiet air of despair, of the classic, depressed tenor of New Year's Eve dos: another year over - thank God - and a new one just begun - oh, God. This year? 'A family party,' she said. Now you may not believe this, but she actually sounded enthused by the prospect. Inevitably, I thought of Mrs Patrick Campbell's famous sigh: 'Oh, for the deep, deep peace of the marital bed after the hurly-burly of the chaise longue.' The thought recurred with my next contact - male, married, with small children and transatlantic career. 'Going to see the Burning of the Clocks in Brighton where I now reside. Then going to bed at around three minutes past midnight.' Or how about the next one - male, married, high earner, one child and 'colourful' past. 'As if I know yet. Burying my head under the pillow, probably!' Those who did have plans were somehow overconscious of their modesty. Take this American-born songwriter now resident in Paris, with ambitions to be the next Serge Gainsbourg - his first steps were dreadlocks and a dancer girlfriend. This New Year, he'll be skiing in Canada. Last year, though, that was the big one - a party at Versailles with Russian gangsters. 'This New Year seems quite a let-down,' he admitted. It's the same, perhaps even more so, for his ex-wife - English, north London, with live-in-partner but no offspring. She said she'd be spending New Year's Eve at the computer, finishing off her biography of Serge Gainsbourg. There was a moment, in London at least, when it looked as if it was all going to be different. When Ken Livingstone and Bob Geldof got together to plan a capital night out, there was a feeling abroad that last year's grand spectaculars would become the new norm. For the night that mathematicians, calendar-fans, pedants and sub-editors insist is the real last night of the second millennium, Ken and Bob dreamed their dreams of a giant world city celebration. They even ordered the fireworks, which duly arrived at Tilbury Docks - a couple of weeks after all manner of bureaucrats kiboshed their party. It's been replaced by 'events and activities right across Greater London'. Culture Secretary Chris Smith added - in the authentic deadening tones of a Captain Mainwaring - that 'local authorities have responded magnificently to the challenge'. That is, they've rounded up the usual prospects: beacon lighting; high-street processions culminating in the town park; small-scale laser displays; family based, multicultural firework shows. I made the last one up, by the way - though only by pasting together elements of real shows. Still, it does sound like the time-honoured British New Year's Eve. Say it quiet, it's back and it's proud. And in bed by three minutes past midnight. This survey was conducted over a period of three days in the second week of December. Population was unweighted sample of friends of author who returned his calls and emails.",

It's about that terrifying first encounter with future in-laws. I call the film a comedy, but it's really a farce as defined by Eric Bentley in Life of the Drama, where he argues that farce is the obverse of tragedy, a situation where we laugh despite, or rather because of something very serious being at stake. </p> <p>Terence Rattigan's The Winslow Boy, recently filmed with considerable fidelity by David Mamet, opens with a clever dramatic juxtaposition. Inside a comfortable suburban house a young army officer is nervously asking Edwardian paterfamilias Arthur Winslow for his daughter's hand in marriage. Outside, hiding in the garden, Winslow's son is waiting to inform his father that he has brought disgrace on the family by being dismissed from naval college for theft. This is the interweaving of tragedy and comedy. But merge these two elements - a cowering suitor who threatens to bring disgrace on a middle-class family - and you get farce. This is what John Hamburg and Jim Herzberg, the co-screenwriters of Meet the Parents do and the result is touching, frightening and hilarious. </p> <p>In Woody Allen's Annie Hall there's a sequence in which Jewish New Yorker Alvy Singer visits Annie's middle-class Protestant home in the Midwest and is treated like an alien from a different planet. Meet the Parents makes a whole movie of this situation, but reverses the journey - awkward Jewish male nurse Greg (Ben Stiller) from Detroit is courting blonde middle-class shiksa Pamela, who teaches at a fancy Chicago nursery school, and she takes him East to meet her parents. They live in Oyster Bay, Long Island, a byword for Waspish exclusivity and site of President Theodore Roosevelt's summer White House. On the way the airline loses Greg's suitcase containing his clothes, wash bag and the engagement ring that was to accompany his postponed proposal of marriage. That proves to be the least of his worries. </p> <p>Pam's mother Dina (Blythe Danner) is polite middle-class solicitude, but her father is another matter. First half-concealed by net curtains as he appraises the visitor from an upstairs window, Pam's father, Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro), is an overbearing monster. He's a blood brother to those outrageous US Marine Corps dads played by Robert Duvall in The Great Santini (he was also married to Danner) and Chris Cooper in American Beauty. From their first encounter, Jack eyes this outsider with the suspicion of a store detective about a shifty customer, and over the next couple of days a psychological battle accompanies an escalating series of gaffes and appalling accidents. </p> <p>Jack and Dina find it hard to cope with Greg's Jewishness, lower-middle-class background and job. Then there's his name. 'It's pronounced the way it's spelt - F-O-C-K-E-R,' says Greg. As Pam's parents lie in bed that night they realise that if she marries him their daughter will become Pamela Martha Focker. </p> <p>Jack's questioning of Greg, however, is no random amateur affair. It transpires that Jack is a retired psychological profiler for the CIA and spent a year in a North Vietnamese prison camp where he 'learnt patience'. There's a terrific sequence where Greg strays into Jack's secret den, its walls covered with pictures of him with President Clinton and Colin Powell, and working undercover in the Arab world. There's also an old-fashioned polygraph and Jack straps Greg up for a routine test that includes such questions as 'Are you sleeping with my daughter?' and 'Have you ever watched a pornographic video?' </p> <p>The rattled Greg shatters the urn containing the ashes of Jack's mother with the cork from a champagne bottle, nearly puts Pamela's sister's eye out playing volleyball, loses the family cat, creates a conflagration that calls for the fire brigade, turns the garden into a foul swamp by causing a cesspool to overflow and is unjustly suspected of being a pothead. All the while he's being mocked by the Byrnes's friends and shown up by Pam's rich, kind, brilliant ex-fianc\u00e9 (Owen Wilson), who has become Jack's close friend since being scared off. </p> <p>These incidents are briskly and plausibly handled, and our hearts go out to Greg. But what makes it so good are the complementary performances of Stiller as the decent, anxious, increasingly frazzled suitor and De Niro, who gives his best comic performance to date as Greg's cropped-haired, malevolently twinkling, permanently suspicious nemesis. There is a sharp coda which suggests that there could be a sequel, and it won't be anything like Father of the Bride 2.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Foreign Office officials warned yesterday of the possibility of more bomb attacks in Saudi Arabia after a device placed on a car badly injured a British man. The explosion was the third attack on a Briton in less than a month and has prompted fears that a terrorist group is deliberately targeting British workers in the oil rich kingdom. David Brown, a Scottish customer services manager for Coca Cola, suffered severe injuries after picking up what appeared to be a fruit juice container left on the windscreen of his car in the town of Al Khobar in the country's Eastern province. The carton exploded, seriously injuring Brown's face and hands. Brown's wife was with him but was unhurt. Saudi authorities yesterday sent specialists to Al Khobar and an evacuation team was on standby to bring Brown to Britain if necessary. However, Saudi security sources told the state Saudi news agency that Brown's condition was stable. Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain, said: 'This is a serious incident. The safety of the British community in Saudi Arabia is paramount. The attack follows a car bomb on 17 November which killed a Briton, Christopher Rodway, 48, and wounded his wife. That blast was followed five days later by a car bomb which wounded two men and a woman. All three victims were British. Officially Foreign Office officials were refusing to draw a link between the three attacks, but privately they admitted more bombs may be planted. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the bombings.",

He was a tremendously intellectual award-winning writer with a very fierce aspect and I was a very junior editor who had just bought the paperback versions of two of his hardback novels. </p> <p>We met at a publisher's party and later had lunch and got on incredibly well. Going out with one another was difficult because Mike lived in Yorkshire and I lived in London - but added to that was Mike's obsession with rock climbing and my terror of heights. The only way I ever got to see him was to accompany him rock climbing.</p> <p>We decided to make a life together and bought a cheap attic flat in Peckham Rye. It was vile, but we stayed there seven years. We had a lot of arguments because Mike was a literary writer and I was a fiction publisher: I believe writing should reach as many people as possible. These arguments spread to other things until we were falling out more than we were getting on.</p> <p>When we split up, Mike stopped climbing for a while and I became completely obsessed. We also started writing novels together, as Gabriel King. We had made various aborted attempts, but never had the impetus to get going on it while we lived together. Breaking up released us to work together in a way that we could never have done before.</p> <p>I had been Tolkein's editor since the 80s and I always said to Mike that we must write a big epic fantasy together. Writing is usually such a solitary and lonely business, so this was wonderful. I like to have a plan of action, whereas Mike likes to get in there and start writing the bits he's interested in. So we split the characters into two separate narratives, each taking one, and then weaving them in and out of one another. </p> <p>We are now working on our fourth novel together and also on solo projects. I've just spent two weeks in New Zealand on the film set of the adaption of Tolkein's The Hobbit; I'm writing a book to come out with the film. But whether or not we are working on our own, we still rely on each other for advice about publishing negotations or someone to strike ideas off.</p> <p><strong>Mike Harrison:</strong> I was living in Yorkshire and all my money was spent on rock climbing gear and none on clothes. When we met I was wearing some ghastly tweed jacket. I was instantly besotted with Jane. Thereafter I would spend two hours a day thinking of as many excuses as I could to phone her. </p> <p>Jane's personality is a combination of power and placidity. I would push her too far banking on that placidity and then get bitten. And I am incredibly intense; if I'm not on fire with something I'm not alive, and I think that tired Jane. It was like living with a maniac. I write in the same intense way. I find it difficult to write anything for weeks then I'll write non-stop for four days.</p> <p>Breaking up took me longer to get over because I am such a romantic. I was a little heartbroken. The amusing or amazing thing is that we spent nearly nine years together but couldn't write a book together, and the moment we split up we were able to do it. Writing together enabled us to run the relationship down calmly rather than just flying apart. We have since gone on to form other relationships. </p> <p>We came up with a name, Gabriel King: the first name had to have three syllables to read well on a cover, and be a little fey so that it could be a man or a woman. Collaborations are rare in fiction and it is very hard to make them work. At book signings Jane signs Gabriel and I sign King. Readers are often quite shocked to find that there are two of us. </p> <p>We've got complimentary qualities: she's a good editor and writes much faster than me; I write very intensely and say here it is. When I work on my own I start with a very strong structure so I can write the end, then the middle and the beginning last of all. That's not possible when working with someone else. The advantage of writing in two strands is that you get two completely different tones of voice. Jane's central character sounds completely different to mine. You would have to work very hard to get that as a solo writer.</p> <p>\u0095 Gabriel King's third novel The Knot Garden is published in paperback on 4 January (\u00a310, Century).</p>",

Despite first-half territorial advantage, however, there were early warnings of the threat posed by counterattacks engineered by Di Canio, and the smooth movement up front of lone striker Kanout\u00e9, who did not find it difficult to retain possession even when harried by three defenders. But Everton were still looking bright and purposeful in the final minutes of the first half and a snap shot from Thomas Gravesen was nearly lost by Hislop as Campbell closed in threateningly. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>How good a manager am I? At this stage of my career on this side of the game, I cannot answer the question in terms of comparing myself ability-wise to all the others in the position, because so many of them have greater experience in the post than me. The only time I will be able to make a proper judgment of myself will be when I retire. It was the same when I was a player. </p> <p>However, I am sure that, while I do not enjoy every aspect of managing a club - I am a coach at heart and happiest when working with the players on the training field - there isn't an aspect of the job that I do not think I can handle. Moreover, I know that I am a much better manager than I was when I started four years ago. </p> <p>Though Coventry's Premiership position may suggest otherwise, the difference between me now and then is like night and day; and I like to think that I will carry on improving for the simple reason that I will never think of myself as being too big not to question my ability. This was raised recently through a newspaper interview when I was asked if Coventry's slide towards the relegation zone had created any 'self-doubts'. </p> <p>I replied that I am always liable to question myself at key points in my career; that there have been around six periods during my 28 years in the game when this has been particularly pronounced. For example, when I joined Manchester United from Aberdeen, I did ask myself whether I was good enough technically to play top-flight club football in England, and cope with appearing in front of such big crowds. I did not think: 'The likes of Bryan Robson and Norman Whiteside are lucky to have me in their team.' It was the same when I took over from Ron Atkinson as Coventry's manager, and started with a League Cup defeat by Gillingham and three in the Premiership. </p> <p>I am surprised the interview attracted so much attention. I would have thought that everybody in professional football has self-doubts from time to time. Football is a game in which confidence is essential and, because of its macho nature, I think there is a sensitivity among managers and players about coming across in a way that might cause them to be perceived as being mentally weak and vulnerable under pressure. </p> <p>The point is perhaps best illustrated by the extent to which Bryan Robson's honesty has gone against him. It seems to me that his bold initiative in bringing in Terry Venables to help him steer Middlesbrough out of the relegation zone - or, more specifically, his admission that he does not feel confident about doing it on his own - has been seen quite negatively. </p> <p>Of course, much of this stems from the fact that it represents a major change in Robson's image. His recent image as a manager seems totally at odds with the one he had as a player, when he did not appear to have self-doubts at all and was responsible for rescuing more seemingly on-field lost causes than any footballer I have known. </p> <p>But appearances can be deceptive. I like to think that I was as confident as anyone as a player; hence the fact that I was the penalty-taker at all my clubs, and was only 19 when I was appointed captain of Dundee. I was also captain of Leeds United's Second and First Division Championship-winning teams, and the Scotland side. </p> <p>However, the body language I presented did not mean that I never harboured self-doubts. In my view, It was not only natural for me to question myself at every major step up the ladder - it was also necessary for me to do so in order to keep progressing. That little bit of insecurity helped make me work harder. It has been the same in my managerial career, although one major change in me now compared to when I started is that I have become much more philosophical about setbacks and no longer put all the blame on myself when things are not going well. At times like these, I try not to read newspaper stories about me and Coventry - to avoid getting upset and thus expending too much negative energy - and remember the times I have bounced back from bad spells in the past. </p> <p>Though it hurts to lose, I now appreciate more than ever that sometimes it comes down more to circumstances than ability.

      "bodyText": "How good a manager am I? At this stage of my career on this side of the game, I cannot answer the question in terms of comparing myself ability-wise to all the others in the position, because so many of them have greater experience in the post than me. The only time I will be able to make a proper judgment of myself will be when I retire. It was the same when I was a player. However, I am sure that, while I do not enjoy every aspect of managing a club - I am a coach at heart and happiest when working with the players on the training field - there isn't an aspect of the job that I do not think I can handle. Moreover, I know that I am a much better manager than I was when I started four years ago. Though Coventry's Premiership position may suggest otherwise, the difference between me now and then is like night and day; and I like to think that I will carry on improving for the simple reason that I will never think of myself as being too big not to question my ability. This was raised recently through a newspaper interview when I was asked if Coventry's slide towards the relegation zone had created any 'self-doubts'. I replied that I am always liable to question myself at key points in my career; that there have been around six periods during my 28 years in the game when this has been particularly pronounced. For example, when I joined Manchester United from Aberdeen, I did ask myself whether I was good enough technically to play top-flight club football in England, and cope with appearing in front of such big crowds. I did not think: 'The likes of Bryan Robson and Norman Whiteside are lucky to have me in their team.' It was the same when I took over from Ron Atkinson as Coventry's manager, and started with a League Cup defeat by Gillingham and three in the Premiership. I am surprised the interview attracted so much attention. I would have thought that everybody in professional football has self-doubts from time to time. Football is a game in which confidence is essential and, because of its macho nature, I think there is a sensitivity among managers and players about coming across in a way that might cause them to be perceived as being mentally weak and vulnerable under pressure. The point is perhaps best illustrated by the extent to which Bryan Robson's honesty has gone against him. It seems to me that his bold initiative in bringing in Terry Venables to help him steer Middlesbrough out of the relegation zone - or, more specifically, his admission that he does not feel confident about doing it on his own - has been seen quite negatively. Of course, much of this stems from the fact that it represents a major change in Robson's image. His recent image as a manager seems totally at odds with the one he had as a player, when he did not appear to have self-doubts at all and was responsible for rescuing more seemingly on-field lost causes than any footballer I have known. But appearances can be deceptive. I like to think that I was as confident as anyone as a player; hence the fact that I was the penalty-taker at all my clubs, and was only 19 when I was appointed captain of Dundee. I was also captain of Leeds United's Second and First Division Championship-winning teams, and the Scotland side. However, the body language I presented did not mean that I never harboured self-doubts. In my view, It was not only natural for me to question myself at every major step up the ladder - it was also necessary for me to do so in order to keep progressing. That little bit of insecurity helped make me work harder. It has been the same in my managerial career, although one major change in me now compared to when I started is that I have become much more philosophical about setbacks and no longer put all the blame on myself when things are not going well. At times like these, I try not to read newspaper stories about me and Coventry - to avoid getting upset and thus expending too much negative energy - and remember the times I have bounced back from bad spells in the past. Though it hurts to lose, I now appreciate more than ever that sometimes it comes down more to circumstances than ability. The longer I have been in the job, the more I have been prepared to take risks in terms of our style of play. Up to a point, I have widened the scope of the players and myself to make mistakes - and learn. All managers carry certain expectations; and in my case, the main responsibility concerns keeping Coventry in the Premiership. Coventry have been in the top flight for the past 33 years, a remarkable record for our size, and one that has become increasingly difficult to maintain since the formation of the Premiership. So when assessing my development as a manager - at a time when the job is probably harder than it has ever been - I feel that I should be encouraged by the fact that there has been an improvement in our Premiership survival margins. In the light of Coventry's present situation, it is also pertinent for me to remember that I was being described as one of the most promising young managers in England about 18 months ago. I haven't suddenly gone from being a good manager to a bad one. I see no reason why I should not continue to get better with Coventry - especially if I retain an element of self-doubt. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Given his penchant for comedy, coupled with his billing on the programme as the most Ukrainian of Ukrainians, it felt right to ask him to crack a typical joke from his homeland. He looked bemused.

He empathises with his friend Sergei Rebrov, currently going through a similar adaptation process a few miles away at Tottenham. That said, he is confident that his old team-mate from Dynamo Kiev will settle in and fulfil the heady expectations that greeted his arrival at White Hart Lane. 'There is more to come from Sergei. He is a very good player, very quick, very clever, and he will only improve. Maybe he will become the second Jurgen Klinsmann,' muses Luzhny. 'I think he can. Why not?' </p> <p>If he does it will be a tremendous achievement. Klinsmann arrived in London as a fully matured talent armed with heaps of travelling experience, charming English and the character of a born leader.

'He's not going to score against Arsenal, but after that he's quite welcome to score in every match,' he says. </p> <p>Tomorrow's north-London hostilities will be watched with interest back in Ukraine. They are reasonably impressed with Rebrov's performances so far, but, like Luzhny, are waiting for him to find full vibrancy.

It was a fantastic atmosphere,' says Luzhny. </p> <p>Of course, Dynamo don't have neighbourly foes to speak of. In Ukraine's national championship, their biggest enmity is with Shakhtar Donetsk, a two-hour plane ride away. 'It's very difficult to play in Kiev because there are no good rivals,' explains Luzhny.

Moreover, they had played together so long and knew each other so well, it makes it even more difficult.

'There's a trend at the moment for footballers to shave off their hair, but why should I do what everyone else does?' he asks. His claim not to 'focus too much on how I look' is borne out by his own very short, simple beauty routine: L'Oreal Elvive 2-in-1 shampoo after training, Colour Fitness hair restorer to stop his flowing locks going any greyer, a shave with alcohol-free shave cream and then an aftershave balm.

The Italian revealed last week that, during his first five months in London after signing for West Ham, he travelled by Tube. 'Every time I saw old people I gave my seat up to them because I am an athlete and I can stand for a few minutes.' Well done, kind sir. Despite all the talk of him returning to Lazio, Di Canio swears he adores London and claims he wants to stay here when he retires -- he plans to open a gourmet food shop. 'Not for business, just for pleasure, to give the English people the opportunity to eat really good food,' says Di Canio. Don't forget: his autobiography includes the Italian recipe for tiramis\u00f9, so he may well be serious. Vaniteux? Moi? Aston Villa are new men -- and that's official. Says who? The ultimate Mr Vain himself, David Ginola. 'Many of the players apply body sprays, hair gel and so on before going on the field, but that's no surprise - men everywhere are really looking after themselves now and starting to think about what's good for them, whether it's for good health or to be attractive to women,' David tells lad mag Loaded . 'There's a trend at the moment for footballers to shave off their hair, but why should I do what everyone else does?' he asks. His claim not to 'focus too much on how I look' is borne out by his own very short, simple beauty routine: L'Oreal Elvive 2-in-1 shampoo after training, Colour Fitness hair restorer to stop his flowing locks going any greyer, a shave with alcohol-free shave cream and then an aftershave balm. You see, just like the rest of us. denis.campbell@observer.co.uk Tales from the Tabs Weng blanks Petit Emmanuel Petit is desperate to end his Spanish nightmare with a return to Arsenal, but Arsene Wenger is not interested. Instead, Chelsea or even Fulham could step in to bring the 30-year-old back to London. I will spend Rio cash Harry Redknapp has not been put off after failing to land Robbie Keane, and is set to go on an almighty spending spree. \"We should be spending that \u00a318m now. It's the only way. It is all bonus money for us. Let's go and spend it.\" And the rest... Tottenham fans have been blasted by Ramon Vega after the 'Swiss miss' joined Celtic on loan. 'They want Tottenham to always be challenging for success and playing in Europe but why?' he laments. \u0095 Arsenal felt the force of a similar blast from Paolo Vernazza, who joined Watford this week. 'The last young player Arsenal brought through was Tony Adams,' he says. \u0095 Milan 's Andriy Shevchenko is the latest footballer to move into movies. The Ukrainian striker is to appear in 'The Match of Death', a made-for-TV drama. \u0095 Sunderland have been boosted by the news that Kevin Phillips is going nowhere. 'I would be mad to leave the place,' he said. \u0095 West Ham could make a \u00a31.5m move for Titi Camara after Liverpool's reject striker turned down a loan move to Preston. 'He is fast, strong and an absolute snip at the price,' says Harry Redknapp. \u0095 Blackburn 's David Dunn could break Premiership hearts by signing a new contract with Blackburn. 'Hopefully something will be sorted out before Christmas,' he says. \u0095 Newcastle's Warren Barton is keen to stay at Newcastle until the end of his career. 'It's a great honour to represent the club both on and off the field,' he gushed. \u0095 Arsenal's Dennis Bergkamp surprised everyone with his stunning dance moves at the club's Christmas party. 'We used to have disco nights at Ajax and I had a reputation for knowing all the hip-hop moves,' he says. 'I have gone down in Ajax history.' \u0095 Inter's Robbie Keane may want to stay in Italy, but the Milan giants want him out. Liverpool have joined the chase, with Robbie Fowler seamingly destined to leave Anfield \u0095 Leeds could sell Darren Huckerby to Celtic. \u0095 Peter Taylor wants to take Villa's Lee Hendrie to Leicester. \u0095 Tottenham chairman Alan Sugar is finally ready to give in to unhappy fans and leave the club. Easyjet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou is favourite to replace him \u0095 Southampton's Hassan Kachloul, available for nothing at the end of the season, could be on his way to Spurs in time to see Sugar off, particularly if Middlesbrough move for Darren Anderton.",

      "body": "<p>The so-called 'black box' of Brazilian soccer could be prised open next year when Congress, which is investigating the chaotic state of the country's national sport, resumes after its end-of-year-recess. </p> <p>The two Congressional commissions of inquiry, which are probing Brazilian football, celebrated their last full working week of the year last week by voting to extend the reach of their investigation. </p> <p>The most dramatic development came in the Senate's commission, whose members voted on Wednesday to investigate the bank accounts of 15 leading clubs, 29 club directors and ex-directors and six directors of the Brazilian Football Confederation, including president Ricardo Teixeira. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the parallel commission in the lower house voted on Thursday to question four more ex-national team players, including Romario. The lower house will also interrogate an agent known as Ted Junior, accused of promising to find foreign clubs for teenage would-be soccer players and then abandoning them abroad. He is one of a number of agents believed to be involved in what is described as 'the trafficking of minors'. </p> <p>Other problems include the failure of the CBF to hold the national championship this year, a farcical fixture list, which frequently forces teams to play three games a week, and constant changing of the rules of competitions. </p> <p>This has been aggravated by a series of scandals and suspicions over what happens to the millions of dollars clubs receive from television fees and the transfer of star players abroad. </p> <p>Adding to the controversy, a number of Brazilian players have been caught in Europe this year with fake Portuguese passports, while national team coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked in September amid a series of allegations of improper practices. </p> <p>Congressmen also hope to determine how much influence multi-national sportswear giants Nike have in the running of the national team, which they sponsor. </p> <p>The former Fifa president Joao Havelange, the former Brazil coach Mario Zagallo and the striker Edmundo, a member of the 1998 World Cup team, are among those to have been previously interviewed by the lower house, mainly in connection with the Nike contract. </p> <p>However these hearings initially produced more entertainment than serious revelations. Edmundo's presence caused chaos in the lower house, with politicians, secretaries and cleaning staff alike abandoning their posts to catch a glimpse of a player known as 'The Animal'. </p> <p>Havelange spent much of his interrogation praising his own 24-year reign in charge of Fifa, even digressing at one point to tell the inquiry that 800,000 trees had been planted in Dubai in the last 10 years. </p> <p>Since then, however, the investigations have taken on a more serious tone. At the end of last month, the Senate commission interrogated Luxemburgo for five hours and revealed that the ex-coach's income had exceeded $9million (\u00a36.4m) in the last five years. </p> <p>After asking Luxemburgo to justify his earnings and hearing the reply 'I'm very disorganised' on numerous occasions, Senators told him his explanations were unconvincing. Luxemburgo is likely to be re-questioned at a later date and also faces a grilling in the lower house commission. </p> <p>The Senate also heard from CBF president Teixeira who told them that the confederation had cash flow problems - despite a contract with Nike, which he said is worth an average of $16m (\u00a311.4m) a year and which he described as the best of its type in the world. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Other problems include the failure of the CBF to hold the national championship this year, a farcical fixture list, which frequently forces teams to play three games a week, and constant changing of the rules of competitions. This has been aggravated by a series of scandals and suspicions over what happens to the millions of dollars clubs receive from television fees and the transfer of star players abroad. Adding to the controversy, a number of Brazilian players have been caught in Europe this year with fake Portuguese passports, while national team coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked in September amid a series of allegations of improper practices. Congressmen also hope to determine how much influence multi-national sportswear giants Nike have in the running of the national team, which they sponsor. The former Fifa president Joao Havelange, the former Brazil coach Mario Zagallo and the striker Edmundo, a member of the 1998 World Cup team, are among those to have been previously interviewed by the lower house, mainly in connection with the Nike contract. However these hearings initially produced more entertainment than serious revelations. Edmundo's presence caused chaos in the lower house, with politicians, secretaries and cleaning staff alike abandoning their posts to catch a glimpse of a player known as 'The Animal'. Havelange spent much of his interrogation praising his own 24-year reign in charge of Fifa, even digressing at one point to tell the inquiry that 800,000 trees had been planted in Dubai in the last 10 years. Since then, however, the investigations have taken on a more serious tone. At the end of last month, the Senate commission interrogated Luxemburgo for five hours and revealed that the ex-coach's income had exceeded $9million (\u00a36.4m) in the last five years. After asking Luxemburgo to justify his earnings and hearing the reply 'I'm very disorganised' on numerous occasions, Senators told him his explanations were unconvincing. Luxemburgo is likely to be re-questioned at a later date and also faces a grilling in the lower house commission. The Senate also heard from CBF president Teixeira who told them that the confederation had cash flow problems - despite a contract with Nike, which he said is worth an average of $16m (\u00a311.4m) a year and which he described as the best of its type in the world. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>For men in any other occupation, the urges which prompt football club managers to rush joyfully towards jobs guaranteed to induce pain and misery would be categorised by psychiatrists as a form of psycho-sexual disorder, almost certainly related to masochism. </p> <p>Those afflicted invariably evince the classic symptoms: they are helpless to resist their impulses, believing themselves to be perfectly normal, wondering why other people don't have these feelings. Only the badly stricken, for example, could have accepted without the slightest compunction - indeed, with relish - the vacancy which arose at Dundee United last August, when Paul Sturrock finally regained his sanity and quit. </p> <p>Alex Smith is a serious case, and has been since adolescence, when he began to develop a dedication to the game bordering on the pathological. He became a manager immediately after completing his playing career and has been one for more than 30 years, taking enough buffetings at places such as Stirling Albion, St Mirren, Aberdeen and Raith Rovers to discourage a fighting bull. </p> <p>The prospect of regenerating Dundee United, who had been sliding towards irretrievable breakdown for a decade, would be regarded by Smith as something to cherish rather than dread. Nothing that has happened since has had the slightest impact on his buoyant optimism. Even a visit from Rangers this evening will not be enough to cloud this veteran's sunny outlook, despite a record which 'boasts' a single victory and 15 defeats from 19 outings and bottom place in the Premier League. </p> <p>'That's where you get your motivation from, an incurable optimism,' says Smith. 'I never go into any match, with any team, thinking we'll lose it. In the minutes immediately after a defeat, your mind instantly goes forward to the next engagement and you believe that will be better. </p> <p>'Even when we went to Ibrox earlier in the season and nobody else in the world thought we had a prayer, I truly believed that if we did what I thought we could do and Rangers didn't perform at their best, we could take something from the game. It's always like that, it's why we love it so much.' </p> <p>Of course, Smith has been long enough and sufficiently successful in the game - the Scottish Cup won with St Mirren, the same trophy and the League Cup won with Aberdeen and needing only a draw in the final match with Rangers to secure the 1991 championship - to know that irrational optimism has to be supported by astute manipulation and preparation in the construction of a decent team. </p> <p>The main problem at United in the past 10 years or so has stemmed from the intransigence of Jim McLean, the former manager and chairman, who found it impossible to cope with the great changes in football. Used to success on the back of home-bred and reared players, McLean took longer than most to recognise Scotland's diminishing production of young talent. </p> <p>When he finally accepted the inevitability of having to visit the market and do business with agents, he proved to be a very unsound judge. Tannadice has been littered for years with overpaid, substandard foreigners, who are merely passing through. </p> <p>Smith has noticeably taken steps to reverse the process, ridding the club of a cluster of third-rate imports - including three from that improbable supplier of brilliant footballers, Honduras - and reintroduced a Scottish strain. The arrivals of the former Rangers and Watford midfielder, Charlie Miller, the ex-St Mirren and Scotland under-21 defender Jamie Fullarton and the former Morton and Oxford United striker Derek Lilley are testimony to his intentions. </p> <p>'I really do think it's necessary at a club like this,' said Smith. 'I think it makes for a better dressing-room.' However an awful ankle injury to Fullarton has deprived him of that promising player's services for the rest of the season - the kind of misfortune which tends to visit struggling clubs - and it remains to be seen whether or not Lilley and Miller will be helpful influences. </p> <p>Miller, now 24, is particularly interesting, because he was a precocious talent who broke into the Rangers' first team as a teenager. But he tended to take the left-hand path in his private life, fell out of favour and was sent to Watford by Dick Advocaat when the Dutchman succeeded Walter Smith at Ibrox in 1998. </p> <p>'When I came here,' said Advocaat, 'they told me what a great player Charlie was at 19. I had him at 22 and he had all the natural talent you could need, but he wasn't applying it. In the end, it was Charlie who came to me and asked what would be best for him. I told him he should go to a club where he could start playing again.' </p> <p>Smith believes that Miller is still does not have the physical conditioning necessary to complement his ability and has arranged a regime during the winter break specifically for the midfielder's benefit. </p> <p>'Last year, the club went to Florida during the January break when in third place in the league,' he said. 'Between their return and the end of the season, they only won one match. This year, we're going nowhere. I've told the players they are to be sent home after the game on 2 January and they are not to see me again until the 11th. </p> <p>'But not Charlie. He'll have what you would call a mini pre-season, because we have to get him back to proper condition. I've told Charlie he has to realise that, by his early thirties, he could make himself a wealthy man. I have to get him to look back on his mistakes. </p> <p>'I think there is maturity there now, because he's married and has two kids, but he still needs guidance. I reminded him that he must have been very special to get into that Rangers team as a teenager.' </p> <p>Miller could return the favour by reminding Rangers of what they lost with a punishing performance at Tannadice tonight. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Used to success on the back of home-bred and reared players, McLean took longer than most to recognise Scotland's diminishing production of young talent. When he finally accepted the inevitability of having to visit the market and do business with agents, he proved to be a very unsound judge. Tannadice has been littered for years with overpaid, substandard foreigners, who are merely passing through. Smith has noticeably taken steps to reverse the process, ridding the club of a cluster of third-rate imports - including three from that improbable supplier of brilliant footballers, Honduras - and reintroduced a Scottish strain. The arrivals of the former Rangers and Watford midfielder, Charlie Miller, the ex-St Mirren and Scotland under-21 defender Jamie Fullarton and the former Morton and Oxford United striker Derek Lilley are testimony to his intentions. 'I really do think it's necessary at a club like this,' said Smith. 'I think it makes for a better dressing-room.' However an awful ankle injury to Fullarton has deprived him of that promising player's services for the rest of the season - the kind of misfortune which tends to visit struggling clubs - and it remains to be seen whether or not Lilley and Miller will be helpful influences. Miller, now 24, is particularly interesting, because he was a precocious talent who broke into the Rangers' first team as a teenager. But he tended to take the left-hand path in his private life, fell out of favour and was sent to Watford by Dick Advocaat when the Dutchman succeeded Walter Smith at Ibrox in 1998. 'When I came here,' said Advocaat, 'they told me what a great player Charlie was at 19. I had him at 22 and he had all the natural talent you could need, but he wasn't applying it. In the end, it was Charlie who came to me and asked what would be best for him. I told him he should go to a club where he could start playing again.' Smith believes that Miller is still does not have the physical conditioning necessary to complement his ability and has arranged a regime during the winter break specifically for the midfielder's benefit. 'Last year, the club went to Florida during the January break when in third place in the league,' he said. 'Between their return and the end of the season, they only won one match. This year, we're going nowhere. I've told the players they are to be sent home after the game on 2 January and they are not to see me again until the 11th. 'But not Charlie. He'll have what you would call a mini pre-season, because we have to get him back to proper condition. I've told Charlie he has to realise that, by his early thirties, he could make himself a wealthy man. I have to get him to look back on his mistakes. 'I think there is maturity there now, because he's married and has two kids, but he still needs guidance. I reminded him that he must have been very special to get into that Rangers team as a teenager.' Miller could return the favour by reminding Rangers of what they lost with a punishing performance at Tannadice tonight. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

You can watch from a hide (with live commentaries at 3.30pm and 4pm), perch in an observation tower, explore pens and ponds with a Christmas Quackers' trail, or play in the children's Discovery Centre. Top of the flocks are the great Bewick's swans. </p> <p><strong> Welney</strong>, the trust's reserve near Wisbech in Cambridgeshire (01353 860711), gets the Whoopers. Any WWT site scores more than 'seven swans a swimming'. </p> <p>Move on from Slimbridge to Bristol for more wildlife in <strong> Wildscreen@Bristol</strong> (0117 915 5000). Opened six months ago, Wildscreen uses multi-media displays and 75,000 living creatures to show where life came from and where the environment is heading. </p> <p><strong> 27 December: Walk off the Christmas pud</strong> </p> <p> If you've spent hours glued to Harry Potter on the radio or PlayStation 2, the National Trust has a post-Christmas programme of <strong> guided walks</strong> - none too demanding - led by wardens and foresters at some of its properties. Today's are at <strong> Kingston Lacy, </strong> Dorset; <strong> Clumber Park, </strong> Nottinghamshire; <strong> Prior Park, </strong> Somerset; and <strong> Holmwood Common, </strong> Surrey. Search the trust website (see overleaf) for details and any changes, or call 020 8315 1111 (office hours). </p> <p><strong> 28 December: Go to the ballet</strong> </p> <p> It wouldn't be Christmas without 'nine ladies dancing'. For Nutcracker fans (who don't mind queueing for day tickets): the <strong> Royal Opera House </strong> (020 7304 4000) has the Royal Ballet in cracking form as usual. The <strong> London Coliseum </strong> (020 7632 8300) presents English National Ballet's modern take on the classic Christmas story. And Birmingham Royal Ballet brings its popular version to the new <strong> Lowry Centre</strong> in Salford (0161 876 2000). If Sugar Plum fairies are out, the <strong> Royal Festival Hall</strong>, London (020 7960 4242), has a new adaptation of the favourite Dickens story, A Christmas Carol. Ballet meets modern dance, acrobatics and stilt-walking, set to pop music and carols.</p> <p><strong> 29 December: Take a sleigh ride in the sky</strong> </p> <p> From Port Isaac to Penzance, Cornwall takes its Christmas lights seriously. In a dozen different harbours, the quaysides, boats, streets and buildings are lit with thousands of coloured lights and spangly setpieces. They are beautiful from the ground, but they are breathtaking from the air. British International offers evening <strong> helicopter rides from Penzance </strong> over two of the most spectacular displays at Newlyn and Mousehole. Flights last eight minutes, cost \u00a315 per person, and take off (weather permitting) between 5.30pm and 7pm (also on 22, 27 and 28 December). It's the next best thing to a sleigh ride over the rooftops (01736 363 871). </p> <p><strong> 30 December: Get a taste of Christmas Past</strong></p> <p><strong> Hampton Court Palace</strong> (020 8781 9500) has Tudor-style Christmas events all day (27 December - 1 January). See a royal feast cooked in the vast kitchens and follow it in procession to the Great Hall. Meet a court jester, hear period music on early instruments, and join a traditional dance through the state apartments. Allow at least three hours, or you'll miss some of the jugglers, entertainers and costumed guides. </p> <p><strong> Fountains Abbey</strong>, near Ripon, North Yorkshire (01482 888158), is one of many historic sites with school holiday activities. There are pastimes and puzzles, such as draughts using abbots and monks, in the barn; Victorian games outside, and a winter explorers' trail through the deer park.</p> <p><strong> New Year's Eve: Party on the streets</strong></p> <p><strong> Cardiff</strong> rings in 2001 with Calennig, which is Welsh for New Year's gift. This is Wales's answer to Hogmanay: a three-day carnival, starting on 30 December, with fairgrounds, a children's zone in the City Hall, live music and fireworks. The climax comes on New Year's Eve, with a lantern procession from Cardiff Castle, a 'Space Oddity' family fire show, top bands on the Calennig music stage and a fireworks display as the finale (029 2087 3690).</p> <p><strong> New Year's Day: Steam into 2001</strong> </p> <p> The annual timetables on steam train lines generally run on until today. <strong> Nene Valley</strong>, Cambridgeshire, the home of the Rev A.W.

Winter Wonderland, in East Princes Street Gardens, has twinkling lights, music, hot food, games and rides for non-skating youngsters; not to mention Edinburgh Castle as a backdrop. Today is the end of the city's Hogmanay festival but the rink remains open, with boots for hire, evening sessions and star turns until 7 January (0131 220 6260). </p> <p><strong> Liverpool </strong> has an outdoor rink near St George's Hall for smaller children, and in <strong> London </strong> the newly-restored Somerset House has a full-size rink in its eighteenth-century courtyard, which is open daily between 11am and 10pm (0207845 4670).</p> <p><strong> 3 January: Laugh at a live panto</strong> </p> <p> Booking tickets is a bit easier by now.

For fairy-tale plots and look-behind-you jokes catch Cinderella at the Theatre Royal,<strong> Bath </strong> (01225 448844); the Theatre Royal, <strong> Brighton</strong> (01273 328488), and the <strong> Derby</strong> Playhouse (01332 363275).

Or Dorothy and the circus performers, with definitely no animals, in The Wizard of Oz Christmas Circus at <strong> Blackpool</strong> Tower (01253 292029). </p> <p><strong> 4 January: See a classic on stage</strong> </p> <p> Dramatisations of children's classics come in all shapes and sizes. For the over-fives the <strong> Manchester</strong> Library Theatre presents Mary Norton's The Borrowers (0161 236 7110). At <strong> Basingstoke</strong> in Hampshire, the Haymarket Theatre (01256 465566) does its own delightful thing with Jungle Book the Musical . </p> <p>The Royal Shakespeare Company's new musical The Secret Garden is at <strong> Stratford-upon-Avon</strong> (01789 403403; matinees sold out). </p> <p>The RSC's previous hit, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe , has moved to Sadler's Wells, Rosebery Avenue, <strong> London</strong> (020 7863 8000). </p> <p><strong> 5 January: Find fun in the snow</strong> </p> <p> Try <strong> tubing</strong>, whizzing downhill on giant squashy tubes, over snow or dry tracks. The first place in Britain to have this cool new sport is <strong> Lecht 2090, at Strathdon</strong>, Grampian (01975 651440). One of Scotland's smallest ski areas (good for kids and starters), Lecht is now a year-round family activity centre. As well as skiing and snowboarding it has quad bikes (for eight-year-olds-plus), the UK's first 'Devalkarts' and mini karts (for four to 10-year-olds) on a bouncy-castle type track.

      "bodyText": "Boxing Day: Heed the call of the wild 'A partridge in a pear tree' may look very fine, but nothing beats thousands of winter migrants winging in for an evening feed at Slimbridge Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust in Gloucestershire (01453 890333). You can watch from a hide (with live commentaries at 3.30pm and 4pm), perch in an observation tower, explore pens and ponds with a Christmas Quackers' trail, or play in the children's Discovery Centre. Top of the flocks are the great Bewick's swans. Welney, the trust's reserve near Wisbech in Cambridgeshire (01353 860711), gets the Whoopers. Any WWT site scores more than 'seven swans a swimming'. Move on from Slimbridge to Bristol for more wildlife in Wildscreen@Bristol (0117 915 5000). Opened six months ago, Wildscreen uses multi-media displays and 75,000 living creatures to show where life came from and where the environment is heading. 27 December: Walk off the Christmas pud If you've spent hours glued to Harry Potter on the radio or PlayStation 2, the National Trust has a post-Christmas programme of guided walks - none too demanding - led by wardens and foresters at some of its properties. Today's are at Kingston Lacy, Dorset; Clumber Park, Nottinghamshire; Prior Park, Somerset; and Holmwood Common, Surrey. Search the trust website (see overleaf) for details and any changes, or call 020 8315 1111 (office hours). 28 December: Go to the ballet It wouldn't be Christmas without 'nine ladies dancing'. For Nutcracker fans (who don't mind queueing for day tickets): the Royal Opera House (020 7304 4000) has the Royal Ballet in cracking form as usual. The London Coliseum (020 7632 8300) presents English National Ballet's modern take on the classic Christmas story. And Birmingham Royal Ballet brings its popular version to the new Lowry Centre in Salford (0161 876 2000). If Sugar Plum fairies are out, the Royal Festival Hall, London (020 7960 4242), has a new adaptation of the favourite Dickens story, A Christmas Carol. Ballet meets modern dance, acrobatics and stilt-walking, set to pop music and carols. 29 December: Take a sleigh ride in the sky From Port Isaac to Penzance, Cornwall takes its Christmas lights seriously. In a dozen different harbours, the quaysides, boats, streets and buildings are lit with thousands of coloured lights and spangly setpieces. They are beautiful from the ground, but they are breathtaking from the air. British International offers evening helicopter rides from Penzance over two of the most spectacular displays at Newlyn and Mousehole. Flights last eight minutes, cost \u00a315 per person, and take off (weather permitting) between 5.30pm and 7pm (also on 22, 27 and 28 December). It's the next best thing to a sleigh ride over the rooftops (01736 363 871). 30 December: Get a taste of Christmas Past Hampton Court Palace (020 8781 9500) has Tudor-style Christmas events all day (27 December - 1 January). See a royal feast cooked in the vast kitchens and follow it in procession to the Great Hall. Meet a court jester, hear period music on early instruments, and join a traditional dance through the state apartments. Allow at least three hours, or you'll miss some of the jugglers, entertainers and costumed guides. Fountains Abbey, near Ripon, North Yorkshire (01482 888158), is one of many historic sites with school holiday activities. There are pastimes and puzzles, such as draughts using abbots and monks, in the barn; Victorian games outside, and a winter explorers' trail through the deer park. New Year's Eve: Party on the streets Cardiff rings in 2001 with Calennig, which is Welsh for New Year's gift. This is Wales's answer to Hogmanay: a three-day carnival, starting on 30 December, with fairgrounds, a children's zone in the City Hall, live music and fireworks. The climax comes on New Year's Eve, with a lantern procession from Cardiff Castle, a 'Space Oddity' family fire show, top bands on the Calennig music stage and a fireworks display as the finale (029 2087 3690). New Year's Day: Steam into 2001 The annual timetables on steam train lines generally run on until today. Nene Valley, Cambridgeshire, the home of the Rev A.W. Awdry's original Thomas the Tank Engine, operates Thomas's Winter Warmers (01780 784444). The Icknield Line, from Chinnor in Oxfordshire to Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire, has Mince Pie Specials (01844 353535). Didcot Railway Centre, in Oxfordshire,gets up steam at the old Great Western depot (01235 817200). Isle of Wight Steam Railway offers reduced price Hangover Specials (01983 884343) and The Bluebell Line in Sussex is on track as usual (01825 722370). 2 January: Get your skates on Open-air ice skating is the new rock 'n' roll, in winter at least, and Edinburgh claims the biggest and best outdoor rink. Winter Wonderland, in East Princes Street Gardens, has twinkling lights, music, hot food, games and rides for non-skating youngsters; not to mention Edinburgh Castle as a backdrop. Today is the end of the city's Hogmanay festival but the rink remains open, with boots for hire, evening sessions and star turns until 7 January (0131 220 6260). Liverpool has an outdoor rink near St George's Hall for smaller children, and in London the newly-restored Somerset House has a full-size rink in its eighteenth-century courtyard, which is open daily between 11am and 10pm (0207845 4670). 3 January: Laugh at a live panto Booking tickets is a bit easier by now. (Oh no, it isn't. Oh yes, it is!) For fairy-tale plots and look-behind-you jokes catch Cinderella at the Theatre Royal, Bath (01225 448844); the Theatre Royal, Brighton (01273 328488), and the Derby Playhouse (01332 363275). Aladdin is at the Bradford Alhambra (01274 752000) and Theatre Royal, Plymouth (01752 267222). Peter Pan flies in to the Theatre Royal, Lincoln (01522 525555); the Yvonne Arnaud, Guildford (01483 440000), and the Tron Theatre, Glasgow (0141 552 4267). Babes in the Wood is at the Mercury, Colchester (01206 573948) and the Bristol Old Vic (0117 987 7877). Dick Whittington is at the King's Theatre, Edinburgh (0131 529 6000) and Theatre Royal, York (01904 623568). For a non-traditional alternative (and it is, very) try Alice in Boogie Wonderland, the Rock 'n' Roll Panto at Liverpool 's Everyman Theatre (0151 709 4776). Or Dorothy and the circus performers, with definitely no animals, in The Wizard of Oz Christmas Circus at Blackpool Tower (01253 292029). 4 January: See a classic on stage Dramatisations of children's classics come in all shapes and sizes. For the over-fives the Manchester Library Theatre presents Mary Norton's The Borrowers (0161 236 7110). At Basingstoke in Hampshire, the Haymarket Theatre (01256 465566) does its own delightful thing with Jungle Book the Musical . The Royal Shakespeare Company's new musical The Secret Garden is at Stratford-upon-Avon (01789 403403; matinees sold out). The RSC's previous hit, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe , has moved to Sadler's Wells, Rosebery Avenue, London (020 7863 8000). 5 January: Find fun in the snow Try tubing, whizzing downhill on giant squashy tubes, over snow or dry tracks. The first place in Britain to have this cool new sport is Lecht 2090, at Strathdon, Grampian (01975 651440). One of Scotland's smallest ski areas (good for kids and starters), Lecht is now a year-round family activity centre. As well as skiing and snowboarding it has quad bikes (for eight-year-olds-plus), the UK's first 'Devalkarts' and mini karts (for four to 10-year-olds) on a bouncy-castle type track. Or make for the Cairngorm Reindeer Centre, at Aviemore, and join the daily cavalcade (weather permitting) to feed the friendly reindeer. Warm waterproofs essential (01479 861228) Twelfth Night: Say goodbye to Christmas The Geffrye Museum in east London, home of domestic style through the ages, always burns the holly and the ivy on Twelfth Night after stripping out 'Christmas Past' decorations. Wrap up well for a last round of carol singing, mulled wine and Twelfth Night cake in the garden (020 7739 9893). Or watch Leominster Morris men perform the age-old wassail ceremony in apple orchards at Aymestrey, Herefordshire. This is not designed for young children, but is fine for older ones. From the Riverside Inn the dancers parade with flaming torches, lighting bonfires and a 'thorn cage lantern' as they go, and pour cider round a tree to bid the sun return and ensure a good crop (01544 388686).

Lurking in the shrubbery nearby, several squads of Indian police officers armed with sticks keep a close watch on the proceedings. A few small boys who arrive late plunge their feet into a ceremonial pool before dashing to the mosque, caps askew. </p> <p>The crowd later spills out into the main courtyard. Several demonstrators unfurl a black banner and start shouting. They also wave posters carrying a picture of the Taj, beneath one of history's more esoteric slogans: 'Love &amp; sacrefy [sic] symbol.' There is a brief standoff with the police, before the protesters surge out through the Taj's formal gardens and head down the road to deliver a petition to Agra's district magistrate. </p> <p>These are troubled times indeed for India's most famous monument. And it is not just Agra's vociferous Muslim community which is unhappy. Last month the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) - the body responsible for preserving the country's heritage - dramatically raised admission prices for the Taj Mahal and other important sites. </p> <p>Muslims who had previously got in free on Fridays along with everybody else suddenly found themselves charged 10 rupees. If you are poor, have to pray five times a day, and have a large family, this soon mounts up, they pointed out. Muslim leaders describe the move as an insidious blow to the freedom to practise their religion, and said it confirmed their worst suspicions about India's right-wing Hindu nationalist-led government. </p> <p>But the ASI reserved its most blatant whammy for foreign tourists who now have to pay 960 rupees (\u00a314) to get in. The fee used to be 15 rupees (22p). </p> <p>Already many dazed backpackers, after checking their now out-of-date Lonely Planet guides, are giving the Taj a miss. The cost of a day's sightseeing in Agra, including the newly expensive Red Fort and the Mughal palace at nearby Fatehpur Sikri, now comes to \u00a328. </p> <p>The increase has provoked some foreigners to emulate the militant tactics adopted by Agra's Muslims. Two weeks ago a group of Japanese tourists staged a sit-down protest in front of the mausoleum, built by the Mughal King Shah Jahan to enshrine the body of his wife. Others, including Andrew Lubran, of Colchester, have written angry letters to the local Agra papers complaining of India's 'racist policy' to Westerners. The new Taj entrance fee was 'excessive and insulting', he said. </p> <p>Agra's shopkeepers, tour guides, rickshaw wallahs and touts have been moaning too, as their business evaporates. Several cheap guesthouses next to the Taj have gone bust. 'We are the country of Gandhi. We have an ancient culture. We are against these racist entrance fees,' Abhinav Jain, who runs the Agra Marble Shoppe said. </p> <p>The ASI has defended its new policy by pointing to the fact that other countries such as neighbouring Sri Lanka and Russia also charge a dual tariff. It cites the example of the Hermitage in St Petersburg, where non-Russians pay nearly \u00a37, 10 times what the locals do. </p> <p>'It's a great building but it's not worth 960 rupees to get in,' Oxford student Aoife Smith said yesterday, as she strolled past one of the Taj's minarets. The country's 14 world heritage sites, including the erotic temples at Khajuraho, and at Konarak, Orissa, are nearly \u00a37 each. Other previously free lesser ruins cost more than \u00a33. </p> <p>Indian's tourism minister Ananth Kumar has been strangely reluctant to defend the new charges. When The Observer finally caught up with him, next to a tea urn at a party, and asked him how he justified the hike, he failed to answer, smiling glassily before moving off with a posse of grim-faced aides. </p> <p>The ASI's director Komal Anand was more forthcoming and said the extra revenue would be 'ploughed back' into restoring India's 3,606 mostly crumbling monuments - a claim few tourism industry observers believe has much credibility. </p> <p>Unless the Indian authorities back down, the affair threatens to destroy the classic India year out, as immortalised by William Sutcliffe and other traveller-novelists. Guides at the Taj Mahal estimate that 50-100 foreign students a day are now turning up at the red sandstone front gate - only to leave again without going inside. </p> <p>'We were so disappointed by these price rises,' Helen Walton, 23, travelling round India with her boyfriend Miles Ross, 25, said. 'They were totally unexpected. No one minds paying a little bit more - say 100-200 rupees - but $5, $10, even $20 is totally out of backpackers' budgets. It's really sad, because it means we're simply not going to things at all, which can't be what the government wanted. We are now heading off to Nepal instead.' </p> <p>The backlash has already spread as far as Britain, where last month angry tour operators bent Kumar's ear over breakfast in London. With brochures already printed, they complained that the extra entry fee costs would now come directly out of their profits. They also wondered how the hike could be reconciled with India's aim of increasing tourist numbers from 2.4 to 4 million. 'This is a huge blow to Indian tourism. We are very upset,' Arjun Sharma, of SITA Travels, explained. 'It comes on top of an increase in the Indian visa fee from \u00a319 to \u00a330.' </p> <p>Most operators were now planning to drop several monuments from their future itineraries, he added. </p> <p>Back at the Taj itself, as sun sets over the Yamuna River, and garlands of marigolds float downstream, the Muslim demonstrators are gradually dispersing. With each passing Friday it seems more likely that they will get their way. They, after all, have votes, unlike foreign backpackers. </p> <p>Staff at the ASI ticket booth have already put up a homemade cardboard sign which reads: 'Fridays free' - even though they are supposed to charge. The walls outside the ticket grille have been daubed with graffiti, which reads 'Black Day' and - in Hindi - 'ASI thief'. No one wants to be beaten up next to the world's most famous monument to love. </p> <p>'Muslim people made the Taj. Shah Jahan was a Muslim King,' Mehtab Pappu, 22, from Agra, said. 'All we want is to be allowed to come here and pray.'</p> <p><strong>What price a wonder of the world?</strong></p> <p>Other world attractions and what they charge... </p> <p><strong> The Colosseum</strong> in Rome, Italy: \u00a33.15 </p> <p><strong> The Great Wall of China</strong>: At the main tourist spot in Badaling admission is \u00a32.05. </p> <p>The Inca city of <strong> Machu Picchu</strong>, Peru: \u00a36.80; students \u00a33.40 </p> <p><strong> The Parthenon</strong> in Athens: \u00a33.58; students \u00a31.79 </p> <p><strong> Stonehenge</strong> in England: \u00a34 for adults, \u00a33 for students. </p> <p><strong> Walt Disney World</strong>, Florida: 1-day pass, adults (age 10 up) \u00a333.09; children, \u00a328.62. </p> <p><strong> The Millennium Dome</strong>, Greenwich, London: Adults \u00a320, children \u00a315.50</p>",

We are against these racist entrance fees,' Abhinav Jain, who runs the Agra Marble Shoppe said. The ASI has defended its new policy by pointing to the fact that other countries such as neighbouring Sri Lanka and Russia also charge a dual tariff. It cites the example of the Hermitage in St Petersburg, where non-Russians pay nearly \u00a37, 10 times what the locals do. 'It's a great building but it's not worth 960 rupees to get in,' Oxford student Aoife Smith said yesterday, as she strolled past one of the Taj's minarets. The country's 14 world heritage sites, including the erotic temples at Khajuraho, and at Konarak, Orissa, are nearly \u00a37 each. Other previously free lesser ruins cost more than \u00a33. Indian's tourism minister Ananth Kumar has been strangely reluctant to defend the new charges. When The Observer finally caught up with him, next to a tea urn at a party, and asked him how he justified the hike, he failed to answer, smiling glassily before moving off with a posse of grim-faced aides. The ASI's director Komal Anand was more forthcoming and said the extra revenue would be 'ploughed back' into restoring India's 3,606 mostly crumbling monuments - a claim few tourism industry observers believe has much credibility. Unless the Indian authorities back down, the affair threatens to destroy the classic India year out, as immortalised by William Sutcliffe and other traveller-novelists. Guides at the Taj Mahal estimate that 50-100 foreign students a day are now turning up at the red sandstone front gate - only to leave again without going inside. 'We were so disappointed by these price rises,' Helen Walton, 23, travelling round India with her boyfriend Miles Ross, 25, said. 'They were totally unexpected. No one minds paying a little bit more - say 100-200 rupees - but $5, $10, even $20 is totally out of backpackers' budgets. It's really sad, because it means we're simply not going to things at all, which can't be what the government wanted. We are now heading off to Nepal instead.' The backlash has already spread as far as Britain, where last month angry tour operators bent Kumar's ear over breakfast in London. With brochures already printed, they complained that the extra entry fee costs would now come directly out of their profits. They also wondered how the hike could be reconciled with India's aim of increasing tourist numbers from 2.4 to 4 million. 'This is a huge blow to Indian tourism. We are very upset,' Arjun Sharma, of SITA Travels, explained. 'It comes on top of an increase in the Indian visa fee from \u00a319 to \u00a330.' Most operators were now planning to drop several monuments from their future itineraries, he added. Back at the Taj itself, as sun sets over the Yamuna River, and garlands of marigolds float downstream, the Muslim demonstrators are gradually dispersing. With each passing Friday it seems more likely that they will get their way. They, after all, have votes, unlike foreign backpackers. Staff at the ASI ticket booth have already put up a homemade cardboard sign which reads: 'Fridays free' - even though they are supposed to charge. The walls outside the ticket grille have been daubed with graffiti, which reads 'Black Day' and - in Hindi - 'ASI thief'. No one wants to be beaten up next to the world's most famous monument to love. 'Muslim people made the Taj. Shah Jahan was a Muslim King,' Mehtab Pappu, 22, from Agra, said. 'All we want is to be allowed to come here and pray.' What price a wonder of the world? Other world attractions and what they charge... The Colosseum in Rome, Italy: \u00a33.15 The Great Wall of China: At the main tourist spot in Badaling admission is \u00a32.05. The Inca city of Machu Picchu, Peru: \u00a36.80; students \u00a33.40 The Parthenon in Athens: \u00a33.58; students \u00a31.79 Stonehenge in England: \u00a34 for adults, \u00a33 for students.

He won six major trophies in eight years between 1986 and 1994, making him the most successful manager in Arsenal's history, yet he claims he could not take them on to the level occupied by Manchester United because the board were not prepared to pay the transfer fees or wages demanded by top players. </p> <p>'My biggest problem was that I was not strong enough to stand up to the board over money, in terms of wages and bringing in top players,' he said.

      "bodyText": "George Graham has revealed that he was opposed to the notoriously tight wage structure at Highbury when he was manager there, but his failure to challenge the board of directors over the issue limited Arsenal's chances of sustained success. Graham, now manager of arch-rivals Tottenham, could find himself with money to spend at last if Alan Sugar finally does sell his controlling interest - as seems likely after weekend speculation. He goes into tomorrow night's north London derby still aiming to bring Spurs the sort of success he enjoyed down the Seven Sisters Road at Arsenal. He won six major trophies in eight years between 1986 and 1994, making him the most successful manager in Arsenal's history, yet he claims he could not take them on to the level occupied by Manchester United because the board were not prepared to pay the transfer fees or wages demanded by top players.

There are organised games for the children before dinner, but there is plenty of free time for other excursions. </p> <p>We decided to go on a husky safari. We were taken to a husky farm deep in the forest. It was snowing and the dogs were baying.

I've been there. Which is more than Edward Thomas could say.

When BBC TV canvassed viewers for the Nation's Favourite Poems, Adlestrop steamed in at No 20, which may explain why a signpost on the A436 near Stow-on-the-Wold announcing 'Adlestrop 1' proved impossible to ignore. </p> <p>Thomas's lines encapsulate that moment known to every railway passenger from the days of steam: the sudden silence that descended when a train made an unscheduled stop and the countryside that had hitherto been no more than a passing kaleidoscope was revealed in all its beauty. </p> <p>For succeeding generations, the poignancy of the poem was increased by the knowledge that so soon after that magical June day in 1914 the lights would be going out all over Europe and much of the England that the Thomas poem celebrated was about to disappear forever. Thomas himself was killed three years later at the battle of Arras. </p> <p>The poet captured a moment that this new century cannot reproduce, but not just because of the passing of the age of steam. Today the silence would be broken by a shrill chorus of mobile phones. No one would hear the poet's blackbird for the chatter of inane young men and women in smart suits telling indifferent PAs and passengers at large: 'I'm on the train... We've been delayed at somewhere called Adlestrop... </p> <p> Adlestrop is at the heart of the Cotswolds, that golden triangle of countryside enclosed by the M4, M5 and M40. Britain's largest Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty is a patchwork of rolling fields spread over modest hills and divided by meticulous dry stone walls and teeming hedgerows. </p> <p>In late August the distant stubble fields were stained with poppies, but the hedgerow willow-herb and meadowsweet that Thomas admired had wilted and all the haycocks had long since been replaced by giant yellow 'toilet rolls', produced by today's technology and left in the fields. </p> <p>The area owes much of its popularity among fugitives from the breezeblock belt to the beauty of its local stone. This honey-coloured limestone, which mellows with age, appears to have absorbed millennia of warm sunshine. Buildings seem to grow out of the bedrock beneath the red earth. </p> <p>Cotswold stone imposes a certain egalitarianism on the region. It may be found in majestic medieval churches, manor houses and humble cottages alike. In Stow it even lends dignity to a public convenience. </p> <p>Adlestrop,with its population of fewer than 100, is little more than a triangle of absurdly picturesque houses. Front doors are framed by hollyhocks and thatch roofs are contained in nets. At the top of the village a sign 'To our church' betrays a certain pride. </p> <p>Martin Edwards is chairman of the parish meeting (Adlestrop is too small to rate a council) and is on the rota for mowing the churchyard grass. In June St Mary Magdalene was packed for an Edward Thomas reading and music recital, he recalled. The computer consultant and his wife Julia escaped here from a one-bedroomed flat in Islington. </p> <p>The village is proud of its literary link and happy to welcome the odd literary pilgrim, but would not want an Edward Thomas burger bar.

Great Rollright, Little Rissington, Evenlode, Temple Guiting, the Swells and the Slaughters - Upper and Lower - are all in a 10-mile radius. According to Anne Harvey's excellent anthology, Adlestrop Revisited (Sutton Publishing, \u00a312.99), the name dates from Saxon times and could mean the Village of someone called Tatel. </p> <p> Long before he retired to live in Lobs Cottage, schoolteacher John Gillett was extolling the merits of the poem during an English lesson at his boarding school. 'Adlestrop. What a lovely, sleepy name,' he enthused. 'I don't know whether the place exists or not.' Whereupon Diana Jones leapt up and said: 'Of course it does. We pass it every time we go on holiday.' </p> <p>He could not know that one day he would buy a couple of cottages here, vacated by redundant estate workers, converting them into an idyllic retreat for his retirement. </p> <p>Dorothy Price is sole survivor of the original residents. Until 1998 this frail septuagenarian ran the village post office. Literary pilgrims and railway buffs still consult her, as her grandfather, father and husband were all employed at Adlestrop Station. She is still in touch with Myfanwy, the poet's 90-year-old daughter. </p> <p>Most frequent inquiry posed by visitors is, 'Where is the station?' The answer is, it isn't. In 1966 the station was axed by Lord Beeching, the Doctor Death of rail surgery.

At one o'clock in the morning, when I was off-duty, the group called to ask for some bananas, so I headed off to Chinatown to get some. </p> <p><strong> What shouldn't business travellers miss?</strong> <br> A short city tour is imperative and will include the Kuala Lumpur Tower, the fourth tallest telecoms tower in the world, which houses a revolving restaurant and an observation platform, and the Petronas Twin Towers, the pride of Malaysia and the world's tallest buildings. The sky bridge connecting the 41st floors is open to the public daily. But there are many other sights too: the Batu Caves, a Hindu temple complex consisting of three grand caves. Or Istana Negara, the King's official residence, where visitors can see the changing of the guard daily. The colonial Merdeka Square marks the spot where the Malayan flag was hoisted up for the first time, while the 18-pointed star shape of the National Mosque's main dome represents the 13 states of Malaysia unified by the five pillars of Islam. </p> <p><strong> What about shopaholics?</strong> <br> Suria KLCC, the city's largest shopping centre, is located adjacent to the hotel. The Central Market is a good spot for local handicrafts, while excellent bargains can be found at Downtown Chinatown nearby. It's a sidewalk market that opens in the early evening. Kuala Lumpur's night markets are popular - they are great places to absorb local culture and enjoy spicy foods. </p> <p><strong> What do you suggest for a night out?</strong> <br> Many of the hottest entertainment spots are within walking distance of the hotel. Our own Pacifica Grill and Bar, with its open kitchen and garden views, is one of the most popular restaurants in Kuala Lumpur. Bintang Walk has a stretch of stylish, alfresco restaurants and pubs. If you are willing to take a 15-minute taxi ride there are two rows of chic restaurants in the Bangsar suburb which are popular with expatriates and young people. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.mandarinoriental.com\">Mandarin Oriental</a> reservations: 0800 2828 3838.

      "bodyText": "Any famous guests? Some of the famous people who have stayed here include Shirley Bassey, Jackie Chan, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, Gong Li, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia and the Crown Prince of Cambodia. Any unusual requests? There was one request from a group of British journalists who were visiting for a golf trip. At one o'clock in the morning, when I was off-duty, the group called to ask for some bananas, so I headed off to Chinatown to get some. What shouldn't business travellers miss? A short city tour is imperative and will include the Kuala Lumpur Tower, the fourth tallest telecoms tower in the world, which houses a revolving restaurant and an observation platform, and the Petronas Twin Towers, the pride of Malaysia and the world's tallest buildings. The sky bridge connecting the 41st floors is open to the public daily. But there are many other sights too: the Batu Caves, a Hindu temple complex consisting of three grand caves. Or Istana Negara, the King's official residence, where visitors can see the changing of the guard daily. The colonial Merdeka Square marks the spot where the Malayan flag was hoisted up for the first time, while the 18-pointed star shape of the National Mosque's main dome represents the 13 states of Malaysia unified by the five pillars of Islam. What about shopaholics? Suria KLCC, the city's largest shopping centre, is located adjacent to the hotel. The Central Market is a good spot for local handicrafts, while excellent bargains can be found at Downtown Chinatown nearby. It's a sidewalk market that opens in the early evening. Kuala Lumpur's night markets are popular - they are great places to absorb local culture and enjoy spicy foods. What do you suggest for a night out? Many of the hottest entertainment spots are within walking distance of the hotel. Our own Pacifica Grill and Bar, with its open kitchen and garden views, is one of the most popular restaurants in Kuala Lumpur. Bintang Walk has a stretch of stylish, alfresco restaurants and pubs. If you are willing to take a 15-minute taxi ride there are two rows of chic restaurants in the Bangsar suburb which are popular with expatriates and young people. \u0095 Mandarin Oriental reservations: 0800 2828 3838. Rooms from \u00a370 per night.",

      "byline": "Martin Love",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Skoda Octavia</strong><br> <strong> Price </strong> from \u00a313,200 <br> <strong>MPG </strong> 34.9 <br> <strong>Engine size </strong> 1984cc <br> <strong>Max speed </strong> 123mph <br> <strong>0-62mph</strong> 10.9 seconds <br> <strong>Driven wheels </strong> 2</p> <p>Trousers, muesli, muffin, Skoda... there aren't many words which raise a snigger every time they're mentioned. And the list is about to get shorter. You see, Skoda is no longer a laughing matter. Since Volkswagen put its technical know-how behind SkodaAuto at the beginning of the 90s to gave the ailing manufacturer a \u00a32bn shove, Skoda has been on the road to recovery. Sales have gone up by more than 100 per cent, the vehicles are available in 70 countries around the world and last month Autocar presented Skoda with the prestigious Manufacturer of the Year award. Not bad when you consider that a few short years ago, Skoda was a failsafe in every stand-up's comedy act, and a friend of mine had to put up with jeers and abuse every time he stopped simply because he was driving a Skoda. ('It was much worse when I had the Lada,' he once remarked.) </p> <p>And I have to admit I expected to be on the receiving end of plenty of tired jokes myself when I took delivery of the new Octavia estate (I thought it would be just the excuse my neighbours needed to wheel out old gems, such as: 'What do you call a Skoda with no wheels? A skip!'), but the word already seems to be out on these born-again Skodas. A cabbie told me that taxi drivers were snapping them up (a sure sign of economic sense), and Matt the photographer told me that the Octavia is basically a VW Passat with \u00a35,000 off the asking price. As a colleague put it: 'If you don't mind the badge, the cars are great.' It seems that if this were the glamorous world of fashion, then the Skoda would be Volkswagen's diffusion line. </p> <p>My father, who was joining me and the Octavia Elegance on a pre-Christmas booze-buying trip to Calais, gave the car his 'Canny Scotsman' seal of approval - an accolade that Skoda will no doubt be putting in the prize cupboard alongside its Manufacturer of the Year award. (My father, by the way, is a man who puts value for money ahead of all other considerations in matters of both wine and cars.) </p> <p>Given that our sole purpose in going to France to buy wine was to save money, it seemed fitting that Dad and I were making the crossing in a car which offers all you'd expect from a \u00a320,000 car at a fraction of the price. The Octavia is, in other words, the motoring equivalent of snapping up a decent bottle of St Emilion for a fiver. </p> <p>The Octavia comes with a choice of high-performing engines, ABS is standard, and EBS (electronic brake-force distribution) features on all the turbo-charged versions.

      "bodyText": "Skoda Octavia Price from \u00a313,200 MPG 34.9 Engine size 1984cc Max speed 123mph 0-62mph 10.9 seconds Driven wheels 2 Trousers, muesli, muffin, Skoda... there aren't many words which raise a snigger every time they're mentioned. And the list is about to get shorter. You see, Skoda is no longer a laughing matter. Since Volkswagen put its technical know-how behind SkodaAuto at the beginning of the 90s to gave the ailing manufacturer a \u00a32bn shove, Skoda has been on the road to recovery. Sales have gone up by more than 100 per cent, the vehicles are available in 70 countries around the world and last month Autocar presented Skoda with the prestigious Manufacturer of the Year award. Not bad when you consider that a few short years ago, Skoda was a failsafe in every stand-up's comedy act, and a friend of mine had to put up with jeers and abuse every time he stopped simply because he was driving a Skoda. ('It was much worse when I had the Lada,' he once remarked.) And I have to admit I expected to be on the receiving end of plenty of tired jokes myself when I took delivery of the new Octavia estate (I thought it would be just the excuse my neighbours needed to wheel out old gems, such as: 'What do you call a Skoda with no wheels? A skip!'), but the word already seems to be out on these born-again Skodas. A cabbie told me that taxi drivers were snapping them up (a sure sign of economic sense), and Matt the photographer told me that the Octavia is basically a VW Passat with \u00a35,000 off the asking price. As a colleague put it: 'If you don't mind the badge, the cars are great.' It seems that if this were the glamorous world of fashion, then the Skoda would be Volkswagen's diffusion line. My father, who was joining me and the Octavia Elegance on a pre-Christmas booze-buying trip to Calais, gave the car his 'Canny Scotsman' seal of approval - an accolade that Skoda will no doubt be putting in the prize cupboard alongside its Manufacturer of the Year award. (My father, by the way, is a man who puts value for money ahead of all other considerations in matters of both wine and cars.) Given that our sole purpose in going to France to buy wine was to save money, it seemed fitting that Dad and I were making the crossing in a car which offers all you'd expect from a \u00a320,000 car at a fraction of the price. The Octavia is, in other words, the motoring equivalent of snapping up a decent bottle of St Emilion for a fiver. The Octavia comes with a choice of high-performing engines, ABS is standard, and EBS (electronic brake-force distribution) features on all the turbo-charged versions. The car is solidly built (galvanised-steel bodywork comes with a 10-year anti-corrosion guarantee) and the doors close with a very reassuring clunk. But, more than this, there's the impression that every detail has been considered. The internal lights seem to go on and off when you want them to, the 'Climatronic' heating system automatically brings the car up to your goal temperature without being asked, and the luggage hooks in the cavernous boot are in chrome.

It's always fun when Test cricket takes off its fine clothes and makes a brief appearance in ragged jeans and T-shirts. Not that it was much fun for Pakistan, especially when no fielder moved for Thorpe's last boundary; no one except the batsman seemed to have seen the ball. </p> <p>But the other element was as clear as daylight: Moin Khan's team deserved to lose. In the words of another leader, who had, perhaps like Moin himself, a short span remaining, 'I wasted time, and now doth Time waste me.' That was Richard II, who was liable to sit upon the floor and tell sad stories of the death of kings, something that most Pakistan captains and ex-captains must, in their own style, also do.</p> <p> There are occasions when an umpire will act not necessarily in accordance with the letter of the law, but within its spirit: Steve Bucknor did just that (I'm not sure what his colleague, Nazir Mohammed Junior, had to say). Among the memorable images from the highlights of the last innings included Bucknor tapping his watch, on at least three occasions, in Moin's direction, and Moin, sulky, defiant and defeated near the end, like a minor villain at the morality play's denouement. (Though to be fair, he was generous when facing unwelcome cameras a few minutes later, and the minorities in Pakistan must have been cheered by the fact that a Christian (Yousuf Youhana), and a Hindu (Danish Kaneria) both made the team.) </p> <p>To stay with Moin for a minute: Pakistan were psychologically defeated by an England team who were more clued up, more positive, and more determined. Moin showed himself to be fearful of defeat rather than eager for a chance of victory. I thought the chances were about even when England started their last innings. If I had been in Moin's place, I should have tried to get England out. </p> <p>That would have meant keeping two fielders in catching positions for the spinners, and inviting the big hit. Instead England won by the nurdle and the run-steal. Nothing could have suited Thorpe better than to be given licence to push the ball for ones and twos without any risk of being caught off an edge on to the pads, and without having to essay glory shots on a pitch taking spin. </p> <p>Pakistan's rather unathletic fielders were outrun, and their bowlers lost their line in an atmosphere of negativity and resignation. </p> <p>But England seized their chance with passion and determination. It can be difficult to risk defeat after an arduous tour. There are voices that caution against an approach that could, as they would say, 'risk throwing away all the hard work we've done'. </p> <p>Overall England took the series by stealth, creeping up and snatching the loot at the last minute. But the conviction was plain to see, and bold as brass. Once they sniffed victory caution went out of the window. Perhaps the biggest achievement of the whole campaign was in persuading the players, especially the fast bowlers, to make the best of what has all too often been regarded as a bad job. </p> <p>This attitude was apparent in the non-Test matches too, in which England remained unbeaten. England teams overseas - including ones I have captained - have used the early matches too much for practice, too little for getting into the habit of winning. Part of this new attitude revealed itself in Nasser Hussain's obvious respect for Pakistan, its country and its umpires. He personally showed admirable restraint after two poor decisions in one Test. </p> <p>Sky too, incidentally, went out of their way to show interest and curiosity in the culture of Pakistan, with good short clips featuring bicycle repair men and carpet shops, while The Mirror had the brilliant idea of sending Ian Botham's mother-in-law, and then broadcasting her admiration and pleasure for what she found. What a change from the cheap jibes about bananas and mother-in-laws that used to be so plentiful from the commentary boxes and dressing rooms in the subcontinent.</p> <p> I read recently that Darren Gough had been fed up, counting the days, after a wicketless first Test. But someone must have talked to him, encouraged, cajoled, enthused him to bring into play all his assets - bouncers, yorkers, reverse swing, change of pace, off breaks, even a rare leg break. Instead of moaning about the dead pitches, England's quicker bowlers set about their task with a will, and with full licence to use all this variety to tease a response from unhelpful surfaces. </p> <p>Andrew Caddick, too, though less versatile, stuck to the job, never - at least openly - complaining. All round, though, the greatest revelation was Craig White. He was the selection of the series last summer, and has grown in stature since. In Pakistan, after three noughts in the one-day matches, he scored a fine century in the next match, at Rawalpindi, and has not looked back. I think he would have been my choice as man of the series. In addition to his batting, where he alone of the England team was able to dominate, he enabled Hussain to keep pressure on in the field, at stages of the game when on such pitches a fast bowler is traditionally reduced to mere defensiveness. </p> <p>England's mistake in selection was a double one; they were wrong to pick Ian Salisbury, and the team lacked balance in going to Pakistan with only two spinners. This meant that there was no back-up in case of injury or loss of form - an unthinkable situation when it comes to other departments in the team. Moreover, we have rarely in England produced top-class leg-spinners. The selectors must have been persuaded to take this gamble by the world-wide change in pitches and skills, which has seen a gradual decline in finger spinners. On most contemporary Test pitches, finger-spinners are reduced to being stock bowlers. Here they did turn the ball. Incidentally, another Pakistan mistake lay, it seemed to me, in replacing the accurate off-spinner, Arshad Khan, with a batsman for the last Test - another defensive ploy. But Salisbury has never looked good enough. </p> <p>At his best he does not spin the ball sharply, or get it to dip in, \u00e0 la Warne. Nor does he have a deceptive googly. And at his worst he is money for old rope, as Yorkshiremen, who recognise a long-hop when they see one, might put it. With him, Hussain's success lay in not showing his impatience too much, and in helping Salisbury himself never to give up, whether batting or bowling. Salisbury himself cut a forlorn, but never, to his credit, downcast, figure. </p> <p>Fortunately the orthodox finger spinner, Ashley Giles, had an outstanding tour. He reminds David Sheppard of Hedley Verity - tall, probing, accurate. </p> <p>I was impressed by the confident way in which he was able to vary flight without losing accuracy; it is not easy for so tall a man to give the ball a zip while at the same time allowing it to rise above the level of his hand. It will remain to be seen how far the better grassed pitches elsewhere in the world will emasculate his threat, once England leave Sri Lanka.</p> <p>Finally, both Hussain and Duncan Fletcher come out of the tour with their relationship and reputation enhanced. They seem to have instilled in the players a willingness to learn - even Michael Atherton is said to have devoted hours in the nets to gain an improved technique against spin - and to struggle through, making the most of their assets. </p>",

(Though to be fair, he was generous when facing unwelcome cameras a few minutes later, and the minorities in Pakistan must have been cheered by the fact that a Christian (Yousuf Youhana), and a Hindu (Danish Kaneria) both made the team.) To stay with Moin for a minute: Pakistan were psychologically defeated by an England team who were more clued up, more positive, and more determined. Moin showed himself to be fearful of defeat rather than eager for a chance of victory. I thought the chances were about even when England started their last innings. If I had been in Moin's place, I should have tried to get England out. That would have meant keeping two fielders in catching positions for the spinners, and inviting the big hit. Instead England won by the nurdle and the run-steal. Nothing could have suited Thorpe better than to be given licence to push the ball for ones and twos without any risk of being caught off an edge on to the pads, and without having to essay glory shots on a pitch taking spin. Pakistan's rather unathletic fielders were outrun, and their bowlers lost their line in an atmosphere of negativity and resignation. But England seized their chance with passion and determination. It can be difficult to risk defeat after an arduous tour. There are voices that caution against an approach that could, as they would say, 'risk throwing away all the hard work we've done'. Overall England took the series by stealth, creeping up and snatching the loot at the last minute. But the conviction was plain to see, and bold as brass. Once they sniffed victory caution went out of the window. Perhaps the biggest achievement of the whole campaign was in persuading the players, especially the fast bowlers, to make the best of what has all too often been regarded as a bad job. This attitude was apparent in the non-Test matches too, in which England remained unbeaten. England teams overseas - including ones I have captained - have used the early matches too much for practice, too little for getting into the habit of winning. Part of this new attitude revealed itself in Nasser Hussain's obvious respect for Pakistan, its country and its umpires. He personally showed admirable restraint after two poor decisions in one Test. Sky too, incidentally, went out of their way to show interest and curiosity in the culture of Pakistan, with good short clips featuring bicycle repair men and carpet shops, while The Mirror had the brilliant idea of sending Ian Botham's mother-in-law, and then broadcasting her admiration and pleasure for what she found. What a change from the cheap jibes about bananas and mother-in-laws that used to be so plentiful from the commentary boxes and dressing rooms in the subcontinent. I read recently that Darren Gough had been fed up, counting the days, after a wicketless first Test. But someone must have talked to him, encouraged, cajoled, enthused him to bring into play all his assets - bouncers, yorkers, reverse swing, change of pace, off breaks, even a rare leg break. Instead of moaning about the dead pitches, England's quicker bowlers set about their task with a will, and with full licence to use all this variety to tease a response from unhelpful surfaces. Andrew Caddick, too, though less versatile, stuck to the job, never - at least openly - complaining. All round, though, the greatest revelation was Craig White. He was the selection of the series last summer, and has grown in stature since. In Pakistan, after three noughts in the one-day matches, he scored a fine century in the next match, at Rawalpindi, and has not looked back. I think he would have been my choice as man of the series. In addition to his batting, where he alone of the England team was able to dominate, he enabled Hussain to keep pressure on in the field, at stages of the game when on such pitches a fast bowler is traditionally reduced to mere defensiveness. England's mistake in selection was a double one; they were wrong to pick Ian Salisbury, and the team lacked balance in going to Pakistan with only two spinners. This meant that there was no back-up in case of injury or loss of form - an unthinkable situation when it comes to other departments in the team. Moreover, we have rarely in England produced top-class leg-spinners. The selectors must have been persuaded to take this gamble by the world-wide change in pitches and skills, which has seen a gradual decline in finger spinners. On most contemporary Test pitches, finger-spinners are reduced to being stock bowlers. Here they did turn the ball. Incidentally, another Pakistan mistake lay, it seemed to me, in replacing the accurate off-spinner, Arshad Khan, with a batsman for the last Test - another defensive ploy. But Salisbury has never looked good enough. At his best he does not spin the ball sharply, or get it to dip in, \u00e0 la Warne. Nor does he have a deceptive googly. And at his worst he is money for old rope, as Yorkshiremen, who recognise a long-hop when they see one, might put it. With him, Hussain's success lay in not showing his impatience too much, and in helping Salisbury himself never to give up, whether batting or bowling. Salisbury himself cut a forlorn, but never, to his credit, downcast, figure. Fortunately the orthodox finger spinner, Ashley Giles, had an outstanding tour. He reminds David Sheppard of Hedley Verity - tall, probing, accurate. I was impressed by the confident way in which he was able to vary flight without losing accuracy; it is not easy for so tall a man to give the ball a zip while at the same time allowing it to rise above the level of his hand. It will remain to be seen how far the better grassed pitches elsewhere in the world will emasculate his threat, once England leave Sri Lanka. Finally, both Hussain and Duncan Fletcher come out of the tour with their relationship and reputation enhanced. They seem to have instilled in the players a willingness to learn - even Michael Atherton is said to have devoted hours in the nets to gain an improved technique against spin - and to struggle through, making the most of their assets.",

This is a tale of two wickets, two moments that stand out as pivotal in wiping out for England the longeur of hundreds of bad hours that went before them. </p> <p>The first came at 36 minutes and 16 seconds past four o'clock on Friday 30 June, the second day of the second Test against West Indies at Lord's. </p> <p>It was an extraordinary match in what turned out to be an unusual series. The events that had gone before were these: West Indies led the five-match series 1-0 and then had scored 267 in the the first innings. England settled in for one of their regulation collapses and, by lunch on the second day, were still 10 short of an improbably small follow-on target of 68, with five wickets left. They limped on, finishing their innings 133 behind and staring defeat in the face yet again. </p> <p>And then it all kicked off. At just gone 4.36pm in fading light, Darren Gough found himself looking up from third man at a catch coming his way that would turn the series. </p> <p>Andy Caddick, who had curtailed the West Indies first innings with the first ball of the day (Walsh lbw), now got Sherwin Campbell, on four, to flash and nick. Gough ran, clutched and pouched. It started a collapse of English proportions. West Indies were all out for 54, their lowest total against England, who went on to win the Test, then the series, 3-1. Had Gough dropped that chance... who knows? </p> <p>It was a strange series, inasmuch as England won the Tests easily because of the regular capitulation of the West Indies batsmen. There was no obvious contest, no battle. </p> <p>But it was a victory that signalled a revival. They would put it in the bank and build on it in Pakistan. Not many observers expected England to prevail in the tough environment of the subcontinent, but a drawn series would constitute further improvement and put the team in reasonable shape for tougher times in Sri Lanka and then the ultimate examination, the Ashes series next summer against Australia, whose pre-eminence seems unchallengeable. </p> <p>However, it turned out better than anyone dare dream, and when the key moment came, it came in the gloom again, almost unnoticed at the end of a long day, near the end of an arduous, tense tour. </p> <p>The Tests in Lahore and Faisalabad were grinding stalemates. There was not a lot between the sides, although we had expected Pakistan to be more aggressive. Their tactic, hardly new for them at home, was to wait for the moment. If it did not come, they would not chase it. They were sure England would crack eventually against their superior spin bowling and England, equally, were determined not to give them that opening. </p> <p>Michael Atherton's remorseless century at Karachi, a performance that pleased all but a few critics with its commitment to survival at all costs for nine hours and 35 minutes, allowed England the luxury of waiting for their moment. It came on the fourth day. </p> <p>At precisely 10 minutes and 27 seconds past five o'clock last Sunday afternoon, as the sun snuck through gaps in the western stand, leaving the rest of the ground in shadow, Ashley Giles, bowling left-arm over the wicket into the rough outside the leg stump, got one to curl, dip and spit. The scuffed ball snapped past the slanted bat of Inzamam-ul-Haq like a rattlesnake. The big man, a centurion in the first innings and his team's most reliable batsman (at least when not running between wickets), seemed rooted in a dream world. Perhaps he was thinking of the meal he would consume shortly after sunset to break his Ramadan fast, not long away now. Maybe he was expecting the umpires to intervene and call an early finish, as they had done on every day of the series. What he did not expect was that delivery from Giles to get him out. </p> <p>The moment was suspended for Inzi as he sensed the ball sliding past his thrust-forward left pad and under his dangling bat at an unplayable angle. He'd thought about sweeping, but decided against it when he saw the amount of turn and his stroke stopped mid-swipe. He could only hope it would carry on to the safety of Alec Stewart's gloves, but then he heard the ball bang into off-stump, heard the bails clatter to the ground, heard Stewart's mad celebration, then that of Nasser Hussain and the other close fielders. Inzi was done. </p> <p>From that point on in, England were afforded a glimmer of victory. Until then, the draw was by far the favoured result. Now, with Inzi out for 27 and the total wobbling at 71 for three, Pakistan were nervous. They have a long and inglorious history of disintegrating in the final innings. </p> <p>If Inzi had hung on for seven balls, he would have been granted the refuge of an early stoppage for light. He could have had his meal, his sleep and his wicket. He could have returned refreshed in the morning to kill off the match completely. As it was, his dismissal exposed the tail, Saqlain coming as night-watchman. The spinner would not last long the following morning and England's bowlers worked their way through the remaining wickets before the batsmen took the stage for the most dramatic and unlikely of wins. </p> <p>There have been many other moments of split-second drama in Test history - Eric Hollies bowling Don Bradman for a duck in the last Test in the great man's farewell appearance at The Oval in 1948 or Shane Warne announcing his arrival in England with 'the ball of the century' to bowl a brilliantly bemused Mike Gatting on the second day of the first Test in 1993. Late on Sunday evening, we passed Giles on his way out of his hotel. There was a spring in his step, and ineffable calmness dressing his sun-brown face.

      "body": "<p><strong> This year at the movies was: </strong></p> <p>a) The worst in a decade. </p> <p>b) The worst in history. </p> <p>c) So bad, the Academy should cancel the Oscars. </p> <p>d) All of the above. </p> <p>This ballot, published as the headline to a review of the year in films in Rolling Stone magazine, captures the common feeling of audiences and critics toward Hollywood's latest output. </p> <p> Battlefield Earth, Red Planet, Mission to Mars, Quills, Proof of Life, Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, Gone in Sixty Seconds, Coyote Ugly, Pay it Forward, Remembering the Titans, What Lies Beneath, Autumn in New York, The Perfect Storm, The Beach, Duets, Bounce, The Sixth Day, The Next Best Thing - just a random sampling of the film industry's output this year. Forgettable? Forgotten them already, or at least trying to, say the pundits. 'Every year has lousy movies,' says Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers, 'but Team 2000 launched a relentless assault.' </p> <p>The problem, film critics - and some in the industry itself - suggest, is that the business has lost its nerve. 'The steam has run out of Hollywood and the studios are collectively showing fear of failure,' says Graham Fuller, entertainment editor of the Sunday edition of the New York Daily News . 'This has led to a lack of adventurousness about the films being financed and they prefer to stick to the old formulas. The trouble is the old formulas are past their sell-by date.' </p> <p>The situation, according to tipsters for this year's Oscars, is so dire that only three films stand out as best picture contenders: Ridley Scott's Gladiator, Julia Roberts and her push-up bra in Erin Brockovich and Steven Soderberg's forthcoming Traffic, based on the 1989 Channel 4 drug trade documentary and starring Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones. Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is hotly tipped, but it's hard to imagine a film spoken in Mandarin taking the top award. Others may emerge at the last minute - Cast Away, starring Tom Hanks, for instance - but for the moment the US election phrase 'unprecedented uncertainty' seems most apt. </p> <p>'The creative crisis has allowed films like Crouching Tiger and Traffic, either of which could take best picture, to fill the vacuum. But neither looks nor feels like a conventional Hollywood film,' says Fuller. 'Until two or three years ago the studios were consistent at churning out big movies. They may not have been quality films, but they were effective. That efficiency has evaporated.' </p> <p>So uncertain is the situation that Dreamworks, Steven Spielberg's company, has decided to re-release the animated Chicken Run for best picture consideration - a signal they believe a movie starring plasticine fowl could be better than any starring flesh-and-blood actors. </p> <p>British cinemas too have been affected by the bad year. The lack of action blockbusters or event movies that usually bring in the cash has hit hard. Even George Clooney in The Perfect Storm failed to make the predicted financial splash. Niche market movies such as Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Stephen Daldry's Billy Elliot have also failed to draw in the mass audiences that cover the overheads for distributors and cinema chains. </p> <p>In Hollywood, creative problems are begining to hurt where it hurts most - on the balance sheet. With few certifiable hits, the industry suffered a box-office slump in the middle of the year and sales were still down 17 per cent on last year by mid-November. Ron Howard's The Grinch has done much to pull up overall receipts at the end of the year (it is nearing the $200 million mark in its fourth weekend), but some studios have only escaped with a squeak. </p> <p>Even more ominous, cinema attendance is down for the second year in a row and theatre owners, who face flat fees and a huge glut of multiplex screens, are beginning to complain loudly.

      "bodyText": "This year at the movies was: a) The worst in a decade. b) The worst in history. c) So bad, the Academy should cancel the Oscars. d) All of the above. This ballot, published as the headline to a review of the year in films in Rolling Stone magazine, captures the common feeling of audiences and critics toward Hollywood's latest output. Battlefield Earth, Red Planet, Mission to Mars, Quills, Proof of Life, Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, Gone in Sixty Seconds, Coyote Ugly, Pay it Forward, Remembering the Titans, What Lies Beneath, Autumn in New York, The Perfect Storm, The Beach, Duets, Bounce, The Sixth Day, The Next Best Thing - just a random sampling of the film industry's output this year. Forgettable? Forgotten them already, or at least trying to, say the pundits. 'Every year has lousy movies,' says Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers, 'but Team 2000 launched a relentless assault.' The problem, film critics - and some in the industry itself - suggest, is that the business has lost its nerve. 'The steam has run out of Hollywood and the studios are collectively showing fear of failure,' says Graham Fuller, entertainment editor of the Sunday edition of the New York Daily News . 'This has led to a lack of adventurousness about the films being financed and they prefer to stick to the old formulas. The trouble is the old formulas are past their sell-by date.' The situation, according to tipsters for this year's Oscars, is so dire that only three films stand out as best picture contenders: Ridley Scott's Gladiator, Julia Roberts and her push-up bra in Erin Brockovich and Steven Soderberg's forthcoming Traffic, based on the 1989 Channel 4 drug trade documentary and starring Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones. Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is hotly tipped, but it's hard to imagine a film spoken in Mandarin taking the top award. Others may emerge at the last minute - Cast Away, starring Tom Hanks, for instance - but for the moment the US election phrase 'unprecedented uncertainty' seems most apt. 'The creative crisis has allowed films like Crouching Tiger and Traffic, either of which could take best picture, to fill the vacuum. But neither looks nor feels like a conventional Hollywood film,' says Fuller. 'Until two or three years ago the studios were consistent at churning out big movies. They may not have been quality films, but they were effective. That efficiency has evaporated.' So uncertain is the situation that Dreamworks, Steven Spielberg's company, has decided to re-release the animated Chicken Run for best picture consideration - a signal they believe a movie starring plasticine fowl could be better than any starring flesh-and-blood actors. British cinemas too have been affected by the bad year. The lack of action blockbusters or event movies that usually bring in the cash has hit hard. Even George Clooney in The Perfect Storm failed to make the predicted financial splash. Niche market movies such as Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Stephen Daldry's Billy Elliot have also failed to draw in the mass audiences that cover the overheads for distributors and cinema chains. In Hollywood, creative problems are begining to hurt where it hurts most - on the balance sheet. With few certifiable hits, the industry suffered a box-office slump in the middle of the year and sales were still down 17 per cent on last year by mid-November. Ron Howard's The Grinch has done much to pull up overall receipts at the end of the year (it is nearing the $200 million mark in its fourth weekend), but some studios have only escaped with a squeak. Even more ominous, cinema attendance is down for the second year in a row and theatre owners, who face flat fees and a huge glut of multiplex screens, are beginning to complain loudly. In London the year saw the last screenings at the Golders Green Ionic and at the Hampstead Odeon, and the vulnerability of smaller picture houses has been reflected across the country. But cinema owners are not complaining as loudly as audiences. A recent Wall Street Journal article offered a suggestion to moviegoers fed up with claptrap: just walk out. In a rarely advertised but increasingly widespread practice, theatres will now give money back or free passes to disgruntled customers - in some case, even if you've seen the whole show. The British director Simon Monjack is depressed. He has worked in the States for most of his adult life and says he has rarely seen a weaker list of probable Oscar nominees.

The book covers the country's most important grape varieties and moves through Italy, region by region, from the northwest to Sicily. The result is the best book on Italy in the English language.

      "body": "<p>It is a fine line between feast and farce. A slice or two from a glistening bird, a scrunchy nugget of roast potato, a drizzle of gravy and an ivory puddle of bread sauce is surely celebration enough. Add to that the all-singing, all-dancing entourage of sprouts, chestnuts, sausages, bacon rolls, cranberry sauce, roast parsnips, mashed potato and game chips and you have a pantomime of a meal. Throw in a starter of pt\u00e9 or soup, the (delicious) pudding, mince pies and chocolate truffles and you are in the realms of slapstick. A gaudy paper hat perched on your head and a guaranteed encore of flatulence is, I am afraid, all part of the show that is Christmas lunch. </p> <p>I prefer something simpler. A meal that celebrates the spirit of the season without descending into an orgy of gluttony. A meal that holds up its glass as a toast to the day rather than jumps headfirst into a barrel. I want a Christmas lunch of understated luxury rather than in-yer-face extravagance. </p> <p>I have always found a ladle more hospitable than a carving knife, and when that ladle is dunked into a pot of simmering seafood - an opulent mixture of shellfish, spice and saffron - I know I am in the right place. This year, Christmas lunch will be a small but steaming cauldron of golden seafood. </p> <p>Gilded with saffron and chilli it may be, but our soup will need some white fish to give it body and stop it falling to a mush. I guess we should steer clear of cod, but the stocks of ugly but succulent monkfish show few signs of diminishing and it will give us some meaty, pearl-white lumps to tuck into. Eel is even firmer, but its inclusion should remain just between us. Let slip the dreaded word eel and the elderly will shudder and the youngsters will scream. Failing this, haddock, although it will need a shorter time in the pot. </p> <p>The rest is a matter of what we can catch. A big-name supermarket should have something to interest, but steer clear of mackerel, salmon or anything with dark, oily flesh - it makes for a greasy and overpowering broth. A fishmonger, if you still have such a thing, may have more to offer. Mullet would be good, either the small red or the larger grey. Get them to fillet. Hake will work, and there may be bream. Tiny grey clams - they may be labelled palourdes - scallops and even oysters could go in as a last-minute surprise. </p> <p>We should be prepared to dip our fingers into our soup as well as our spoons, even tuck a napkin into our shirt front. This, after all, is a feast. It is not a French recipe as smooth and greasy as a Park Lane matre d', but a rustic version, as thick and chunky as a Hoxton bouncer. There will be fat fish and plump tomatoes, giant prawns to tear apart, open clams singing their little hearts out, maybe even a mussel or two. If richness is your goal, you could stir in some crab meat but you risk turning your lunch into a seafood chowder, a piscatorial brew so rich that even a little is enough to make one queasy. </p> <p>Spices seem fitting here, and not just because of the cinnamon sticks and star anise currently hanging from the most fashionable of trees. A pinch of dried chilli will give a brick-red colour; saffron will lend a musty, earthy note. All will warm the soul and spread good cheer. Don't get carried away, though. It is worth remembering that spices were once used as currency. </p> <p>You can add wine or water as your wallet takes you. You could add cream if you want. I like the idea of launching tiny ovals of toast on its surface, cut from a baguette or a thinner, trendier fiscelle and spread with a traditional rouille - that tongue-tingling mash of chillies, garlic and olive oil - or, as we already have all that in the pot already, a mound of grated Gruy\u00e8re cheese. An enticing play of textures and tastes. </p> <p>Once everyone has scooped up every drop from their plate and worried every mussel from its shell, they will look at you beseechingly for pudding. I am not sure you can better a small wodge of plum pudding after a bowl of soup such as this. I only tire of it after meat and 10 veg. Try a wibbly-wobbly cr\u00e8me caramel or panna cotta, its even wibblier Italian cousin. You want a dessert that will slide down cool as a cucumber after the spicy soup. </p> <p>I shall save the fruit-laden, brandy-buttered pud for Boxing Day. Christmas Day dessert chez Nigel will be a mixture of sharp mango sorbet and creamy vanilla ice cream, eaten in alternate spoonfuls. And very probably straight from their tubs. </p> <p><strong> A mildly spiced fish soup</strong><br> </p> <p>Serves 4 </p> <p><strong> 2 tbsp olive oil</strong> <br> <strong> a medium-sized onion </strong> <br> <strong> a large carrot</strong> <br> <strong> 2 cloves of garlic, or more if you wish</strong> <br> <strong> a small handful of flat-leafed parsley, chopped </strong> <br> <strong> a little crushed dried chilli </strong> <br> <strong> a long piece of orange peel </strong> <br> <strong> a couple of bay leaves </strong> <br> <strong> a big pinch of saffron threads </strong> <br> <strong> 750g tinned or fresh, skinned and seeded tomatoes </strong><br> <strong> a handful of sprightly coriander leaves </strong></p> <p>for the fish</p> <p><strong> You will need about a kilo of mixed white fish, such as monkfish (get the fishmonger to skin and bone) and eel, a couple of red mullets, filleted, and a few handfuls of clams or mussels in their shells</strong></p> <p>Warm the oil gently in a large pan set over a moderate heat. Meanwhile, peel and roughly chop the onion, then add it to the oil and let it cook until soft and pale. While that is happening you can peel and finely dice the carrot, and peel and chop the garlic. Add them to the onions and continue cooking until soft. </p> <p>Stir in the dried chilli flakes, the length of orange peel and the bay leaves. Put the saffron on a saucer and moisten with a tablespoon or so of water. When it has softened, add it and the liquid to the vegetables. </p> <p>Crush the tomatoes - I do it over the pan with my hands - and add them along with every scrap of juice. Let them cook down a bit to see how much juice they reveal, then add liquid - water or white wine - accordingly. You want it to have the consistency of a loose, soupy stock. Now let it bubble gently towards a boil. </p> <p>Check the fish over for any stray scales and loose bones. Any fish still firmly on the bone is probably a good thing. Cut the eel, monkish, haddock or whatever into large chunks, much longer and fatter than you could eat in one go. Too small and they will shrivel to nothing. You add the fish according to how long it will take to cook. The very meaty fish such as the eel will take longer than the neat, thin fillets of, say, red mullet. Slide them into the thick broth and let them cook until opaque. A matter of a few minutes, but at any rate less than 10 minutes. You will be surprised as to how much flavour they will add to the soup. </p> <p>Scrub the mussels and clams, scrupulously discarding any whose shells refuse to close when tapped. Rinse them all thoroughly; any grit or sand would be a disaster. Add the clams first, they take longer to open and slightly - I am talking seconds here - longer to come to tenderness. Then the mussels. Prawns fall somewhere between the two, depending on what type they are. The most suitable here will be raw (grey) ones. Ready-cooked ones will toughen. </p> <p>The shellfish is ready when it has opened. Taste for salt, adding it gingerly along with black pepper and the green herbs.</p> <p><strong> Elizabeth David's rouille</strong></p> <p>Recipes for rouille can contain hard-boiled eggs, anchovies, tomato pur\u00e9e, mustard and pretty much anything else you can think of. The results are sumptuous. I also like Elizabeth David's edited version, which you will find in her classic A Book of Mediterranean Food . What follows is hers, although I should add that you can make it in a small blender or food processor.

      "bodyText": "It is a fine line between feast and farce. A slice or two from a glistening bird, a scrunchy nugget of roast potato, a drizzle of gravy and an ivory puddle of bread sauce is surely celebration enough. Add to that the all-singing, all-dancing entourage of sprouts, chestnuts, sausages, bacon rolls, cranberry sauce, roast parsnips, mashed potato and game chips and you have a pantomime of a meal. Throw in a starter of pt\u00e9 or soup, the (delicious) pudding, mince pies and chocolate truffles and you are in the realms of slapstick. A gaudy paper hat perched on your head and a guaranteed encore of flatulence is, I am afraid, all part of the show that is Christmas lunch. I prefer something simpler. A meal that celebrates the spirit of the season without descending into an orgy of gluttony. A meal that holds up its glass as a toast to the day rather than jumps headfirst into a barrel. I want a Christmas lunch of understated luxury rather than in-yer-face extravagance. I have always found a ladle more hospitable than a carving knife, and when that ladle is dunked into a pot of simmering seafood - an opulent mixture of shellfish, spice and saffron - I know I am in the right place. This year, Christmas lunch will be a small but steaming cauldron of golden seafood. Gilded with saffron and chilli it may be, but our soup will need some white fish to give it body and stop it falling to a mush. I guess we should steer clear of cod, but the stocks of ugly but succulent monkfish show few signs of diminishing and it will give us some meaty, pearl-white lumps to tuck into. Eel is even firmer, but its inclusion should remain just between us. Let slip the dreaded word eel and the elderly will shudder and the youngsters will scream. Failing this, haddock, although it will need a shorter time in the pot. The rest is a matter of what we can catch. A big-name supermarket should have something to interest, but steer clear of mackerel, salmon or anything with dark, oily flesh - it makes for a greasy and overpowering broth. A fishmonger, if you still have such a thing, may have more to offer. Mullet would be good, either the small red or the larger grey. Get them to fillet. Hake will work, and there may be bream. Tiny grey clams - they may be labelled palourdes - scallops and even oysters could go in as a last-minute surprise. We should be prepared to dip our fingers into our soup as well as our spoons, even tuck a napkin into our shirt front. This, after all, is a feast.

It is currently celebrating the 50th anniversary of its management by the Chapman family, and in each of the bedrooms is a glossy document attesting to the glories and triumphs of the place. To read it, you would think they had discovered a cure for cancer, not just run a nice hotel in a pleasing West Country town for longer than average. </p> <p>It is also a rather bitchy piece of work. In March of this year, Phil Vickery, the hotel's former chef, took the Castle to an industrial tribunal claiming unfair dismissal, having been sacked the year before. The case turned on whether Vickery, who had become a TV chef and started a relationship with Fern Britton, had been paying enough attention to his duties. The tribunal found in his favour but, as the brochure reports, not once but twice, held that he was 50 per cent to blame for his own departure. 'He was subsequently awarded somewhat less than the severance deal he had originally been offered,' the author sniggers. </p> <p>So my teeth were already on edge, even before I got anywhere near the restaurant. They then nurtured my irritation by giving me the very worst table in the room, the only one right next door to the endlessly flapping kitchen doors. Perhaps they thought that, as the only solo diner that night, I wouldn't complain. I promptly asked to be moved to another table in the quarter-full room. After much list consulting, they found another which, happily for me, was next to the table where the current boss, Kit Chapman, was soon seated with his wife. </p> <p>It gave me the opportunity to watch the Chapmans at work. Shortly, they were to be found chatting amiably with two elderly guests nearby. Indeed, being such close friends, they invited them to spend Christmas 2001 with them as their private guests. And then, the moment the couple had left the room, they dispatched a member of staff to find out the names of the people they had just embraced. This is, depending on your point of view, either the work of a consummate hotelier or merely an act of startling insincerity, though probably the one demands the other. At the very least, they could have had the wit not to do it in front of other guests. </p> <p>Around the Chapmans' table the waiters descended to straighten glasses and fold napkins and to generally attend to the governors' desires, while ignoring the bloke sitting to their side with his empty wine glass. My half bottle of Gew\u00fcrztraminer was in an ice bucket on a table way down the other end of the room. I eventually grabbed a waiter's attention and pointed out the winelessness of my glass. 'Which wine are you having?' he asked. I told him to work it out for himself. He came back with a big grin. 'Found it.' Ah, he must have been so proud. </p> <p>The real shame about all these niggling, tiresome details, the things that can turn a great night out into an irritating bore, is that they detract from the food of chef Richard Guest, which is worth the trip. Kit Chapman has long been a champion of British food - he employed Gary Rhodes early in his career - and Guest is continuing the tradition. At dinner, there is a three-course menu at \u00a331. It began with a teacup full of intense and creamy seafood soup, with the requisite frothy head. For my starter, I chose a chicken and leek sausage on a warm salad with what was described as 'salad cream'. This was more of an acidic mayonnaise than anything resembling the yellow scum served up for so long with school dinners. Thank God. It was a fine, if slightly low-key, dish. </p> <p>For the main course, I had the 'Celebration of British Beef', which is about as close to a political statement on a plate as I have ever eaten, and a grand one at that.

And it came with roast parsnips, wilted spinach, pommes pur\u00e9es and a rich, meaty gravy, and was pretty much the last word in nose-to-tail eating. If you like beef, it's close to perfect. </p> <p>I finished with a chocolate orange fondant sponge with white chocolate ice cream, a dish that should be barred to those who have just had the beef, because it's way too much and, though thick and toothsome, it defeated me. The problem is that what I take away from my stay at the Castle is not the memory of this food; it's the smugness of the literature, the distracted air of some of the staff and the Chapmans being so ungraciously gracious.

      "body": "<p>Every garden has a few plants that get special treatment. Coddled and cosseted beyond the call of duty, they fulfil a surprising corner of human need. It is usually because they demand it, sulking and even giving up any attempt to stay alive if they are not recognised as the prima donnas they long to be. These are specimen plants, only deigning to join the hoi-polloi of the garden in the way that a member of the Hollywood A-list descends on a restaurant with minders and paparazzi in tow. I have noticed that there seems to be a trend towards this kind of plants-as-pets gardening, a hybrid that takes in houseplants, conservatories and conventional specialisation.</p> <p>In many ways it is, to my mind, the antithesis of gardening. It crosses the divide between horticulture and gardening. Since the beginning of the 19th century, the British have seen these two things as being one and the same, but of course they are quite different. Gardening is about making and tending gardens as places that comprise - among other things - a medley of plants. Horticulture is about tending plants, and often disregarding the garden in the name of the plant. Therein lies the fault of so many otherwise good gardens.</p> <p>But - and this should blow away any risk of pomposity - horticulture is fun and incredibly rewarding. It makes us feel good to take a special plant and cater for all its whims and needs. If it is exotic, this makes our own midwinter lives a little better, too. So, I am all in favour of horticulture - as long as it is not at the expense of gardening.</p> <p>I have a few plants that fit this list in my own garden, not least the Brugmansias. Our slightly weedy Brugmansia sanguinea flowered moderately well in August, producing flowers that started as pink and unfurled into orangey-yellow trumpets set against marvellously defined leaves, the veins as crisp and incised as handprinted green flock wallpaper. It will, apparently, make 30ft or more in the right conditions, but in the past five or six years has never got much above 5ft. I kept it in its pot, but moved it outside for a couple of months. It has a nasty habit of dying back with rather hysterical form, rising again next spring from a seemingly lifeless carcass.</p> <p>At the end of July, I planted our Brugmansia x candida into a sheltered corner of the walled garden. It had spent the previous six years in a succession of pots in the greenhouse, outgrowing the available space. It didn't help that it changed its name from Datura halfway through this period. I had a girlfriend once who changed her name. It didn't work for me. I fell for the first name and wasn't sure I fancied this other moniker (Monica?) Maybe it happens more than I know outside my tightly sheltered world.</p> <p>However, call it any name you like, I still want to care and tend for these Angels' Trumpets as best I can. As it had lived in a pot for a few years, the roots were bound. One of the main reasons for getting it outside - other than the fact that it was taking up a lot of space - was to give the roots a chance to shake themselves out. I dug it up yesterday and it has worked a treat. The roots have gone from being a dense, pot-shaped block to a fibrous mass of spreading tentacles. It grew at twice any previous rate over the past few months, although it has largely defoliated in the few frosts that we have had. This would have been reduced if I had been more attentive and bought it indoors, but the leaves will yellow and drop even in ideal conditions when they are dormant.</p> <p>Brugmansias mostly come from the Andes, where they grow in wet, warm conditions. Ideally, they would never be exposed to temperatures greater than 30 C or less than 5 C. But as long as the roots do not freeze and that they get plenty of water, they are fairly robust. They really do need lots of water but I have made the mistake in the past of using compost that is too water retentive. They need the same mix and treatment as peaches or citrus plants - lots of water but very good drainage. A potting compost mixed 50 per cent volume of perlite seems about right. They also need regular feeding - once a week in growth and once a month in winter - with either a home-made liquid fertiliser or liquid seaweed.</p> <p>The reason one grows the thing is for the brief show of extraordinary white trumpet flowers. These start as a tight paper spiral and twist open into a fanfare of flower before shrivelling away. Like angels, they come in serried ranks looking like the last movement of Beethoven's Ninth. </p> <p>Brugmansias belong to the same family as Deadly Nightshade, and all parts of the plant are supposedly poisonous. I think as long as you do not chew on them you will come to no ill. This does, however, add a touch of spice to the already exotic. These plants are supposedly magnets for red spider mite and if you see any sign of cobwebs on them, assume the worst - although a spray with soft soap and good ventilation will help. I have found that snails are very fond of them and it is worth picking over the leaves regularly to see what assorted nasties they are harbouring. Within our organic set-up I have no intention of using prophylactic sprays to protect them.</p> <p>In fact I would not normally bother to protect and nourish such foreign, finicky things in my garden. I like to grow native plants or ones that have essentially adapted to the microclimate of this garden - which, like almost everywhere else on these islands, is pretty accommodating. Within these soft parameters this garden is a robust set-up and the general attitude to any growing thing is that if you cannot take it as it is then you ain't going to make it.</p> <p>But I have a soft spot for a few bits and pieces that slip through the rigour of this net. It has nothing to do with collecting and everything to do with tending something exotic. I feel the same about lilies, too, although they are pretty easy for all their incredible opulence.</p> <p>For many people - including my own father - orchids were the popular choice to fit this bill and they do have a kind of opulent, degenerate heaviness - like a connoisseur's drug. However, orchids can be tricky and the average person who wants to love and cherish a special plant is likely to go for the exotic but not the bleedin' awkward. Bonsai fits the bill, although beware cheap imports - they have not been grown in this country. Even if they are a 'native' species, they are not adapted to our climate and are likely to be as fussy as a Brugmansia when it comes to overwintering outside. But it doesn't really matter what you choose for your own private exotica - we are into distinctly personal territory here - as long as it adds a bit of genuine spice to your garden.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden</strong></p> <p>I have been holding back a job for a rainy day, which, given the weather, is a bit of joke. For the past couple of years one of my favourite garden bits of kit has been the mist propagator I treated myself to out of the proceeds of the Fork to Fork TV series. It is 10ft x 3ft, a deep bed of gravel with heated cables looping through it and three nozzles stuck up in the air that shoot mist out when a bit of plastic dries - and that is the extent of my technical understanding of it.</p> <p>But I know exactly the effect it has. Almost any cutting roots in the constant, delicate damp and most seeds germinate better. Propagation suddenly becomes very easy indeed. I assembled it myself, which was both a fiddle and a major triumph. It was put by the side of the greenhouse, more or less in the first position that it would fit, wedged level on scraps of wood.</p> <p>Once the first few weeks of unadulterated ambition had passed, I realised it was in the wrong place. The end section of the greenhouse, separated by a door and partition, would be much better. It would be easier to keep the general atmosphere around the propagator moist and the rest of the greenhouse dry. Also, the open door tends to let in wind, which dries out the thingummy that controls the sprays. So it should be moved.</p> <p>That has been the plan for two years, and now we have begun. Nowadays the greenhouse spends half its time under inches of water simply from general saturation. We needed to raise the floor up above the flood. The next job was to scoop out the gravel and the only way to do this was with an empty catfood tin, before dismantling the whole thing because it would not fit through the partition door. Remember, all this is happening inside a glasshouse. No opportunity for expressions of violent exasperation.</p> <p>Hundreds of fiddly nuts and bolts and hours later and the horrible, ridiculous thing was in useless bits around me. I am ashamed that at this point I gave up and left it to Gareth to put it together again in its new position, which he did with calm efficiency. I love it again now that it is set up in its new home, although it won't get used for another month.</p> <p>I noticed the other day that there is a solitary spray of primroses out on Beaufort's grave - the first of hundreds we have planted and which normally appear at the end of February.

      "bodyText": "Every garden has a few plants that get special treatment. Coddled and cosseted beyond the call of duty, they fulfil a surprising corner of human need. It is usually because they demand it, sulking and even giving up any attempt to stay alive if they are not recognised as the prima donnas they long to be. These are specimen plants, only deigning to join the hoi-polloi of the garden in the way that a member of the Hollywood A-list descends on a restaurant with minders and paparazzi in tow. I have noticed that there seems to be a trend towards this kind of plants-as-pets gardening, a hybrid that takes in houseplants, conservatories and conventional specialisation. In many ways it is, to my mind, the antithesis of gardening. It crosses the divide between horticulture and gardening. Since the beginning of the 19th century, the British have seen these two things as being one and the same, but of course they are quite different. Gardening is about making and tending gardens as places that comprise - among other things - a medley of plants. Horticulture is about tending plants, and often disregarding the garden in the name of the plant. Therein lies the fault of so many otherwise good gardens. But - and this should blow away any risk of pomposity - horticulture is fun and incredibly rewarding. It makes us feel good to take a special plant and cater for all its whims and needs. If it is exotic, this makes our own midwinter lives a little better, too. So, I am all in favour of horticulture - as long as it is not at the expense of gardening. I have a few plants that fit this list in my own garden, not least the Brugmansias. Our slightly weedy Brugmansia sanguinea flowered moderately well in August, producing flowers that started as pink and unfurled into orangey-yellow trumpets set against marvellously defined leaves, the veins as crisp and incised as handprinted green flock wallpaper. It will, apparently, make 30ft or more in the right conditions, but in the past five or six years has never got much above 5ft. I kept it in its pot, but moved it outside for a couple of months. It has a nasty habit of dying back with rather hysterical form, rising again next spring from a seemingly lifeless carcass. At the end of July, I planted our Brugmansia x candida into a sheltered corner of the walled garden. It had spent the previous six years in a succession of pots in the greenhouse, outgrowing the available space. It didn't help that it changed its name from Datura halfway through this period. I had a girlfriend once who changed her name. It didn't work for me. I fell for the first name and wasn't sure I fancied this other moniker (Monica?) Maybe it happens more than I know outside my tightly sheltered world. However, call it any name you like, I still want to care and tend for these Angels' Trumpets as best I can. As it had lived in a pot for a few years, the roots were bound. One of the main reasons for getting it outside - other than the fact that it was taking up a lot of space - was to give the roots a chance to shake themselves out. I dug it up yesterday and it has worked a treat. The roots have gone from being a dense, pot-shaped block to a fibrous mass of spreading tentacles.

Haider, widely ostracised for his Nazi leanings, appeared to revel in the attention and claimed he had received a warm welcome from the Pope.</p> <p>'I think the Holy Father wants to make clear he is really happy to have us here. We donated the Christmas tree and this is the most important thing because we don't want to mix our audience with political activity.'</p> <p>He led a 250-strong delegation from the province of Carinthia, of which he is governor, because it donated the tree that will stand in St Peter's Square this Christmas. Vatican statements that the choice was made three years ago, before Haider became governor, failed to quell demands for the meeting to be cancelled.</p> <p>Before addressing the delegation the 80-year-old pontiff spoke privately for four minutes with the governor and an Austrian bishop. Haider, a Catholic, shook hands with the Pope and knelt to kiss his ring.</p> <p>Despite Vatican hints that the Pope's address to the delegation would call for tolerance - a coded slapdown to his guest's xenophobia - he spoke only of the spiritual message of Christmas trees. The Pope, however, did hand Haider his World Peace Day message, made last week, which condemned racism and xenophobia.</p> <p>The Vatican's Secretary of State and effective papal number two, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, tried to defuse anger in an interview to La Repubblica , saying John Paul has always been open to everybody. 'We must make a difference between an error and one who errs.'</p> <p>Haider, however, suggested his anti-immigrant policies had an ally in the Vatican. An Italian cardinal, Giacomo Biffi, has spoken out against Muslim immigrants.</p> <p>'The meeting between the two represents a moral and historical failure on the part of the Vatican,' said Elan Steinberg, of the World Jewish Congress.</p> <p>Later Haider, without the Pope but accompanied by a brass band and choir, helped to light the tree that towers above St Peter's marble columns. Told that Jewish shopkeepers would turn their lights off at the same time in protest, he said: 'If they've a problem with their electricity, it's nothing to do with me.'</p> <p>Thousands of armed police and plainclothes officers roved surrounding streets and rooftops, and helicopters hovered overhead. Rome had not seen such security since the visits of Fidel Castro and Mikhail Gorbachev.

      "bodyText": "The Vatican turned into a fortress yesterday for a meeting between Pope John Paul II and the far-right Austrian politician J\u00f6rg Haider which infuriated thousands of protesters. Police saturated St Peter's Square to protect Haider from assault, lending an air of siege to a Christmas ceremony intended to promote good will. An 80ft fir tree presented by Haider to the Pope turned into a public relations calamity when Jewish, gay and left-wing groups branded it a symbol of hate. Protesters said reconciliation between Jews and the Catholic Church, a cornerstone of this papacy, had been undermined. Haider, widely ostracised for his Nazi leanings, appeared to revel in the attention and claimed he had received a warm welcome from the Pope. 'I think the Holy Father wants to make clear he is really happy to have us here. We donated the Christmas tree and this is the most important thing because we don't want to mix our audience with political activity.' He led a 250-strong delegation from the province of Carinthia, of which he is governor, because it donated the tree that will stand in St Peter's Square this Christmas. Vatican statements that the choice was made three years ago, before Haider became governor, failed to quell demands for the meeting to be cancelled. Before addressing the delegation the 80-year-old pontiff spoke privately for four minutes with the governor and an Austrian bishop. Haider, a Catholic, shook hands with the Pope and knelt to kiss his ring. Despite Vatican hints that the Pope's address to the delegation would call for tolerance - a coded slapdown to his guest's xenophobia - he spoke only of the spiritual message of Christmas trees. The Pope, however, did hand Haider his World Peace Day message, made last week, which condemned racism and xenophobia. The Vatican's Secretary of State and effective papal number two, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, tried to defuse anger in an interview to La Repubblica , saying John Paul has always been open to everybody. 'We must make a difference between an error and one who errs.' Haider, however, suggested his anti-immigrant policies had an ally in the Vatican. An Italian cardinal, Giacomo Biffi, has spoken out against Muslim immigrants. 'The meeting between the two represents a moral and historical failure on the part of the Vatican,' said Elan Steinberg, of the World Jewish Congress. Later Haider, without the Pope but accompanied by a brass band and choir, helped to light the tree that towers above St Peter's marble columns. Told that Jewish shopkeepers would turn their lights off at the same time in protest, he said: 'If they've a problem with their electricity, it's nothing to do with me.' Thousands of armed police and plainclothes officers roved surrounding streets and rooftops, and helicopters hovered overhead. Rome had not seen such security since the visits of Fidel Castro and Mikhail Gorbachev. Protesters were kept well back and an attempt to block the view of the tree with a banner depicting Auschwitz failed. Two miles away, 1,000 students marched to the tomb of the unknown soldier at Piazza Venezia with banners saying, 'Wojtyla, your tree drips with blood'. The Pope's birth name is Karol Wojtyla. Haider met the Pope in 1993 but became a Europe-wide hate-figure only after being elected governor in 1997. He has apologised for praising Hitler's employment policies but calls for a crackdown on foreigners. European Union countries imposed sanctions on Austria - now lifted - after his Freedom Party entered government. Before arriving in Rome he caused a diplomatic storm by branding Italy soft on immigration and attacking its non-partisan president, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, a left-winger. The prime minister, Giuliano Amato, wrote a letter to the Austrian government demanding they rein in the governor. Haider's star is waning in Austria but in the past year he has turned Italy into a second political front.",

Anyone who's never quite got Stephen Sondheim, anyone who's thought that his spiking of anti-romances with insouciant erudition was a way of flattering his audi ence, should buy a ticket to the Donmar. Michael Grandage's glorious revival of <strong> Merrily we roll along </strong> makes what was once regarded as one of the composer's greatest flops look like one of his most accomplished hits. </p> <p>When the show was first produced on Broadway in 1981, it closed after 16 performances.

Anyone who's never quite got Stephen Sondheim, anyone who's thought that his spiking of anti-romances with insouciant erudition was a way of flattering his audi ence, should buy a ticket to the Donmar. Michael Grandage's glorious revival of Merrily we roll along makes what was once regarded as one of the composer's greatest flops look like one of his most accomplished hits. When the show was first produced on Broadway in 1981, it closed after 16 performances. It's not hard to see how it could go wrong. It's elliptical and its structure is confusing; it begins in 1980 and works backwards to end in 1957. It has a sour theme - selling out. And in tracing the history of a trio of creative friends who betray their talent and their friendship, it never tells you exactly where things went wrong.

Along with hundreds of thousands of others, I have a chunk of my pension scheme invested with the insurer, through this newspaper's Additional Voluntary Contribution scheme. </p> <p>So, yes, even supposed experts can get caught out in an industry seemingly so prone to betraying customers. What is so worrying about this scandal is that it has hit people who obeyed all the rules about preparing for a healthy financial future. </p> <p>Equitable is one of the country's largest managers of AVC schemes, a form of retirement saving that has come into its own as more people realise the need to save privately for retirement. </p> <p>Employers' pension plans received a huge boost when the pensions mis-selling scandal highlighted the good value offered by employers' schemes - even when contracted out to insurers such as Equitable. </p> <p>Many employers did contract out their schemes, in the belief that employees should be able to spread their risk beyond the main in- house scheme. Remember Maxwell? So for me, and the millions of others offered an in-house AVC, the deal seemed too good to ignore, particularly where, as in my case, the employer would top up AVC payments.

      "bodyText": "It's time for me to declare an interest in the Equitable debacle. Along with hundreds of thousands of others, I have a chunk of my pension scheme invested with the insurer, through this newspaper's Additional Voluntary Contribution scheme. So, yes, even supposed experts can get caught out in an industry seemingly so prone to betraying customers. What is so worrying about this scandal is that it has hit people who obeyed all the rules about preparing for a healthy financial future. Equitable is one of the country's largest managers of AVC schemes, a form of retirement saving that has come into its own as more people realise the need to save privately for retirement. Employers' pension plans received a huge boost when the pensions mis-selling scandal highlighted the good value offered by employers' schemes - even when contracted out to insurers such as Equitable. Many employers did contract out their schemes, in the belief that employees should be able to spread their risk beyond the main in- house scheme. Remember Maxwell? So for me, and the millions of others offered an in-house AVC, the deal seemed too good to ignore, particularly where, as in my case, the employer would top up AVC payments. Pension trustees and administrators around the country are now dealing with calls from anxious and angry scheme members demanding to know why employees were not warned of the impending crisis. But there's the rub. Even with hindsight, investors could have done little more than limit the damage.

      "body": "<p>More than 1 million people who have their money entrusted to Equitable Life are wondering what action to take after the insurer closed its doors to new business earlier this month. Equitable, the world's oldest life office, was unable to continue trading on its own after the House of Lords decided it must honour its obligations to pay high rates on annuities - some pegged at 12.5 per cent - to the 90,000 holders of its Guaranteed Annuity Rate policies. Estimating these liabilities at \u00a31.5 billion, it was forced to cease trading after no buyer could be found for the troubled business. </p> <p>Here are some of the main questions that policy holders may be asking. </p> <p> <strong> What is the worst-case scenario?</strong> </p> <p> In theory, Equitable Life could go bust and be unable to pay its debts. Policyholders would then have to rely on getting compensation through the Policyholders Protection Act. However, pensions lawyer Robin Ellison of Eversheds thinks it 'unlikely' that the fund would pay out on all Equitable products - and the Policyholders Protection Board admits that the situation would be a complicated one. It is also unlikely that Equitable will be allowed to go under: the Government - which is trying to encourage people to build up their own private pensions - has too much to lose from letting them get into a bigger mess. </p> <p> <strong> What is the best-case scenario?</strong> </p> <p> Some in the City still believe that a buyer could be found from somewhere through the time-honoured old boy network. Although there would still be considerable disruption, investment returns might start to improve since the business would be part of a going concern again. At the moment, Equitable is itself predicting a decline in its investment returns following its decisions last week to stop operating on a continuing basis, to stop taking new business and to close down in 20 or 30 years when it has paid all its existing obligations. </p> <p> <strong> What is the most likely scenario?</strong> </p> <p> Returns on with-profits pensions, with-profits annuities, endowments and AVC (Additional Voluntary Contribution) plans will be lower than those in well-managed and healthy firms. This is because Equitable will have to take a cautious investment approach to ensure it can meet its liabilities. It will therefore cut back on equity investments and build up fixed-interest investments - assets which provide a more consistent but lower level of income. Most financial advisers see this as the most likely outcome. Independent financial adviser Towry Law expects returns to be 2 per cent lower a year than they would have been otherwise. </p> <p> <strong> Should I cease making payments into Equitable Life with-profits policies?</strong> </p> <p> Your first priority is to avoid making irrevocable decisions, which you might later regret. But nor do you want to throw good money after bad. You might want to stop making payments on a with-profits personal pension or AVC plan, for instance. </p> <p>Since advisers expect that investment returns will be better through other insurers, you might want to start a new plan for future payments elsewhere. The new stakeholder pension - starting in April - could be an option for many people. Charges have to be kept at 1 per cent or less a year. For employees earning under \u00a330,000 a year, it could be used instead of a personal pension or - in addition to belonging to their employers' pension scheme - as a substitute for an AVC. </p> <p>You will not be penalised for not making further payments. </p> <p>However, holders of endowment policies cannot take the option of keeping the plan within the Equitable and stopping payments. 'Endowments either have to be encashed or continued in full, which is not the case with other insurers,' says Clive Scott-Hopkins of adviser Towry Law. Unless you are near the end of the policy, you will probably want to consider cashing in your plan. </p> <p> <strong> Should I transfer my with-profits policy to another insurer?</strong> </p> <p> On a with-profits personal pension or AVC, you will currently have to pay a 10 per cent penalty for transferring. Equitable Life could, if it wanted, up this 'market value adjuster' to 25 per cent in future if it needed the money. Against this, you have to weigh the prospect of lower returns on your investment for the remaining years of its life. Towry Law and Annuity Direct both believe that people with more than five years left to go before retirement would be better off taking the 10 per cent hit now and getting annual returns which could be 2 per cent higher a year from another provider. </p> <p>You might be able to avoid the 'market value adjuster' by being clever with your terminology and actions once you are over 50. At the moment, you escape the Equitable Life adjuster if you are deemed to be retiring. You can be counted as retiring if you draw some of your pension: you could keep most of your fund invested by going into a 'phased retirement' plan and encashing a small sum on your theoretical retirement date. </p> <p> <strong> What should I do about the Equitable Life endowment which underpins my mortgage?</strong> </p> <p> Recognise, as explained above, that the endowment could underperform and might not be enough to repay your mortgage. About 12,000 people use Equitable Life policies to back a mortgage. When it reviewed their performance two months ago, Equitable concluded that only 250 of them might not pay off the mortgage. With the subsequent bad news, this figure is likely to be higher. </p> <p>But, under the current regulatory requirements, Equitable does not have to look at the figures again for another three years. And when they review the situation, they will have to use projected growth rates of 4, 6 and 8 per cent - rates set down by the Financial Services Act. They will not use the lower rates of return which they actually anticipate. </p> <p>So, worried mortgage-holders might want to ask for another projection from Equitable and ponder the situation themselves. If you think there could be a shortfall, you might well want to start saving to plug the gap in an individual savings account or in some other product with another provider. </p> <p> <strong> What is the prognosis for my unit-linked policy?</strong> </p> <p> In theory, investors in unit-linked plans are better off than those in with-profits. While Equitable can dip into the with-profits fund to meet its own debts, the value of unit-linked policies relates to market performance and charges. There is no 'market value adjuster' for someone leaving a unit-linked plan. But there could be knock-on effects, and Equitable unit-linked plans are not an ideal place to be. Charges could go up - and ambitious fund managers will probably want to work somewhere that has a future. </p> <p> <strong> What will my employer do about our Equitable Life AVC scheme?</strong> </p> <p> 'We are getting a lot of questions from worried pension scheme trustees,' says a spokesman for Legal and General. All sensible employers whose AVC schemes are run by Equitable will be considering their options. Better employers will think of setting up a new AVC scheme for future contributions. 'It's hard to see why employees would want to continue paying AVCs into the Equitable,' says Amanda Davidson of independent financial adviser Holden Meehan. </p> <p>Apart from the prospect of reduced investment returns, AVCs are likely to attract the 'market value adjuster' penalty if the policyholder wants to transfer them out before retirement. But many pension scheme trustees could be cautious and slow to move. Some may wait until April when they can point employees earning under \u00a330,000 towards a new 'stakeholder pension' instead of an AVC. Consider stopping your AVCs and paying them into an individual savings account if your trustees have not set up an alternative AVC scheme yet. </p> <p>Some employers have set up their main 'money purchase' occupational pension schemes with Equitable. Trustees should be considering making new arrangements in future - and may be more likely to do so quickly if they get some encouragement from staff. </p> <p>Stopping contributions immediately might not be such a good idea on these schemes if an employee is then going to lose the benefit of their employer's contributions. </p> <p> <strong> What can I do about my Equitable Life annuity?</strong> </p> <p> If you are drawing an annuity - including a with-profits annuity - you cannot switch out. If your annuity is a traditional one with a fixed income, you will continue getting that fixed income. If it is a with-profits annuity, you are in an unpleasant situation from which you cannot escape. 'These people are on a hiding to nothing,' says Davidson. </p> <p>If you have one of the now-famous Guaranteed Annuity Rate products, you should probably stay with it if you have yet to retire but are close to retirement. A payout rate of 12.5 per cent a year is an attractive one. But, if you have several years to go, you might think again. Increasing inflation - albeit an unlikely prospect now - would reduce the attractions of such a policy. </p> <p>Also, the size of the fund you build up will be hit by Equitable's poor investment prospects, as explained above. Some people building up GAR entitlements may decide that these risks are not worthwhile. </p> <p> <strong> What should I do about the term insurance policy I bought from them?</strong> </p> <p> About 200,000 people have Equitable term insurance policies (life policies that pay out a lump sum on death within a set term) and should probably hang on to them. The insurer was particularly attractive to smokers because it did not load premiums against them. The insurer says that all these policies had fixed terms for the duration - so your premiums cannot go higher than the sums you agreed with them at the outset. </p> <p> <strong> Where can I get more information and advice?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.equitable.co.uk\">Equitable Life</a> (helpline 0870 900 8020); <a href=\"http://www.holden-meehan.co.uk\">Holden Meehan</a> (free advice sheet); Towry Law (free advice sheet) 0845 788 9933; <a href=\"http://www.fsa.gov.uk\">FSA</a>.</p>",

Powell, military hero and apparently reluctant politician, is a star, certainly more popular than Bush himself. The Republicans are banking on his appointment to dispel the pall of illegitimacy that still hangs over the incoming President, as well as forge the next era in US foreign policy. Powell was offered but declined the same job by President Clinton. His most public role to date has been to work with disadvantaged young people. The announcement is the perfect springboard for Bush's triumphal entry into Washington on Tuesday, when he plans to meet President Clinton and the vanquished Al Gore. The identification with Bush's father is immediate; General Powell is best known as architect of the Gulf War, the high water mark of George Bush Senior's administration. Yesterday's was a star performance by the retired General, raising fears among some Republicans that he may tower over the new President. While Bush looked an uncomfortable junior partner at his own debut, Powell exuded authority and humanity - and even humour when he joked that he was 'frankly glad' the ceremony 'wasn't at the ranch. I don't do ranch-wear very well; I come from the South Bronx,' he said, 'and let me tell you, those cows look scary'. Powell becomes the first African-American to become Secretary of State - a point he himself emphasised. Bush also displayed his enthusiasm for the fact that 'a kid from the South Bronx can acceed to the office once held by Thomas Jefferson'. Powell is also not the only African-American in the US's new international team: Condoleeza Rice, an expert on Russia and Bush's foreign policy guru during the election, is likely to head the National Security Council. Yesterday was Bush's first showcase event as President-elect, and he used to the occasion in indulge in statesman-like rhetoric: 'We must consult with our allies and friends in times of calm,' he said, 'so that we work together in times of crisis'. He said of his new appointee: 'Wherever he goes, and whoever he meets, the world will see the finest of the United States of America'. But the appointment of Powell is far more of a coup for Bush than it is for the nominee. General Powell has long been regarded as presidential material himself, and the Republican party has been trying for years to lure him into office. Despite his fame for winning the war against Saddam, Powell is not an interventionist. His inclinations are much closer to Bush's drift towards isolationism and a scaling back of US responsibilities in Europe and the world - a policy which deeply alarms other leaders.

Yesterday, Powell said he wanted to 'consult' with the allies before making an assessment, adding that he saw a role for other forces, such as the police, to relieve the military.",

The hospital chain - Charter Behavioral Health Systems - was exposed by a CBS television documentary last year after the deaths were reported. CBS had filmed widespread malpractices, acknowledged by government regulators. This led to a criminal investigation of Charter, which continues. What was not revealed was the fact that Charter's hospitals were leased to the company by a property trust, Crescent, in which Bush purchased shares in 1994.

Bush sold his shares in Crescent at a profit of $114,000 in 1988, after they had been put into a blind trust following his election to the governorship of Texas in 1994.

There was no reason why, or suggestion that, either Bush or Rainwater knew what was happening inside Charter's hospitals. Charter filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.

      "bodyText": "Japanese anxieties about a rising wave of juvenile violence were projected on to the big screen yesterday with the opening of a controversial film that the nation's education minister had taken the unusual step of trying to block. Tens of thousands of mostly teenage movie fans queued for up to two days to be among the first to see 'Battle Royale', a gory tale of delinquent secondary school students who are forced to kill one another to survive. The film, which stars internationally renowned actor and director Takeshi Kitano, depicts the worst fears of a famously crime-free nation that has been horrified this year by a series of brutal murders by teenagers. Set in the near future, when police are powerless to control an epidemic of youth crime, the movie is a modern-day version of 'Lord of the Flies' with automatic weapons and large servings of gratuitous violence. It depicts the struggle between a class of troubled teenagers who are dispatched to an uninhabited island, armed to the teeth, and then told to fight to the death. In one scene, a student stuffs a bomb into the mouth of a classmate's severed head and throws it into a room where three of his competitors are hiding. Another blood-splattered episode shows a girl slicing through the neck of a classmate with a sickle even as the victim begs for mercy. The film is restricted to viewers over 15, but politicians have argued that the graphic violence might prompt copycat incidents and add to the already worrying level of youth crimes. Earlier this week the education minister Nobutaka Machimura urged cinema operators not to screen the film, and he called on distributors and producers to exer cise more self-restraint with regard to films that might be a bad influence on children. His appeal was a significant break from the Japanese government's usual stance of non-interference towards violent films, television, manga cartoons and video games. The shift comes at the end of a year in which the media has been filled with reports of a breakdown of classroom discipline and an outbreak of murderous crimes by 17-year-olds. In May a youth hijacked a bus and killed a passenger, in June aboy battered his mother to death, in August a 17-year-old stabbed three neighbours to death, and this month a boy detonated a home-made bomb in a video store. Kinji Fukasaku, the director of 'Battle Royale', said his film would highlight the problem of youth crime, without adding to it. 'The more violence, the better,' hesaid.

      "trailText": "<p>Jonathan Glazer is part of a brave new wave of British directors beating a path to Hollywood's door, writes  Vanessa Thorpe.</p>",
      "byline": "Vanessa Thorpe",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Jumpy, grainy, ironic, boyishly amateur; we British thought we knew exactly how we liked our modern gangster movies. But Jonathan Glazer is about to surprise us. </p> <p>Glazer is part of a new wave of British advertising directors moving into feature films. Only a brave few have attempted the crossover since Ridley and Tony Scott, Adrian Lyne, Alan Parker and Hugh Hudson went to Hollywood in the early Eighties. It's not that London's new generation of advertising whiz-kids haven't considered it: they've been thwarted, first by the recession of the early Nineties, which led to a slump in big-budget 'showcase' commercials of the kind that tend to catch a movie producer's eye, and then by the film business's infatuation with theatre directors such as Sam Mendes, Nicholas Hytner and Stephen Daldry. That's changing now, with producer Martha Fiennes and directors Simon West, Simon Monjack and Glazer cleverly using bigger budgets and renewed confidence in the advertising industry to attract the attention of backers and producers. </p> <p>Glazer's first film, Sexy Beast, which was shot in Britain and Europe and opens next month, revisits Guy Ritchie's now familiar Snatch gangland turf but with a terrifying and grown-up ferocity. There are no slow-mo shoot-outs and no mockney camaraderie between handsome young hoods. Instead, extraordinarily, the screenplay emerges triumphant, and characterisation is vindicated as a far more frightening tool than a flip attitude to violence could ever be. </p> <p>So far, the 34-year old Glazer is best known for his award-winning television advertisement for Guinness, called 'Surfer'. It made such an impact last year that recent polls have already pronounced it one of the most popular adverts of all time. </p> <p> Sexy Beast is more technically restrained than 'Surfer' - which features a wave of surf morphing into stampeding white horses - and it also thumbs its nose at the spate of ironic gangster films it follows. Glazer says he was working on the project before the gangster phenomenon began but, by chance, the contrasting tone of Sexy Beast is timely. Far from laddish, it is a world-weary dream, which slides slickly into nightmare. Ray Winstone is Gal Dove, a retired heavy who, while happy in Spain with Amanda Redman, is persuaded back into crime by Ben Kingsley's Don Logan - a portrayal that gives new meaning to the word 'insistent'. </p> <p>Glazer, an art school graduate whose first love was the theatre says he wanted 'the words and the actors' to dominate his debut feature. None the less, the track record of young commercial directors-turned-filmmakers was also in the back of Glazer's mind as he filmed. In the past couple of years Simon West has gone from directing Budweiser ads to making Hollywood blockbusters - Con Air and The General's Daughter. But the visual bombast of West's hits is at odds with most of his peers. Martha Fiennes graduated last year from producing commercials to the historical epic Onegin, starring her brother Ralph. </p> <p>Before them - and with rather more of a fuss - Tony Kaye made the transition from British Rail and Guinness to shoot his first feature film in Hollywood, American History X. </p> <p>In fact Guinness is more than good for prospective film directors. The careers of Hugh Hudson, Alan Parker and Ridley Scott were also enriched by it. And during the Seventies, British television advertising in general functioned as a training ground for Hollywood, honing the talents of Adrian Lyne, Ridley's brother, Tony, and David Puttnam. </p> <p>Yet Glazer's contemporaries, including Simon Monjack, who directed Nike's Michael Jordan campaign, and is also about to release his first feature, Two Days, Nine Lives, have had an even bigger playground at their disposal: the music video. </p> <p>'In a sense music videos gave me the greatest freedom of all,' says Glazer. 'The sort of freedom you get from having all the time you want to shoot things in the way you want to. It really is a toybox for a director.' </p> <p>Glazer and Jamie Thralls, whose impressive debut The Lowdown is released next year, have both made award-winning videos for Radiohead. Glazer has also worked with Jamiroquai, Blur and Massive Attack. </p> <p>'There is a greater degree of commercial risk in making an advertisement than a music video, so you are more restricted. Although you are still trying to sneak your own ideas in,' he says. </p> <p>'I hope I always showed a healthy disrespect for the conventional demands of how to sell something. Instead, I worried about how to construct images that would transcend the industry and be remembered by ordinary people.' </p> <p>The switch to feature films has been 'an education'. For a start, both Glazer and Monjack have had to adjust to the marathon shooting schedule and the comparatively low budgets. </p> <p>'A Guinness commercial might only take five or six days to shoot,' says Glazer. 'But you actually have more time to get things right. In features, if you want a red car and a white car turns up you just have to use it.' </p> <p>Monjack, whose debut movie is a thoughtful drama about a group of recovering addicts in a rehab clinic, agrees: 'Suddenly you are encouraged to forget all the wonderful things you were once able to do in adverts. After all, I have worked on individual adverts that cost more than the \u00a33m it took to make this film.' </p> <p>The school of advertisement-trained directors does have its faults, as Monjack and Glazer admit. </p> <p>'We have bad habits,' said Glazer. 'We rely too heavily on cuts. The filmmakers that really inspire me, such as Fellini and Kubrick, have a fluidity and a simplicity.' </p> <p>But there is no question that the advertising alumni have had a major impact, says Gavin Smith, the editor of New York's Film Comment magazine. </p> <p>'One of the styles that has taken over recently is pastiche,' he says. 'It has taken a hold in comedy and in action films such as Charlie's Angels , and it is influenced by these advertising-trained directors.' In fact, Charlie's Angels was filmed by the Gap ads veteran McG. </p> <p>Not surprisingly Glazer is now being courted by Hollywood. He is currently toying with three projects, one of which is set in Las Vegas but 'has nothing to do with gangsters'. But he has no intention of disavowing his commercial roots. </p> <p>'If there is a crossover between these worlds, we should not be snobby. After all, Ridley Scott and Spielberg are both still picking up from the hyper-realism of new music videos and advertisements.' </p> <p>And yet Glazer's own first work is clearly a tentative move away from the world of visual hyperbole. If the exuberant expenditure of drinks and car adverts marked the mood of the very end of the last century, the whiz-kids are now learning self-effacement. There is a fresh search for content. </p> <p>'I wanted to find simplicity in a script to help me get away from excess,' says Glazer. 'I wanted the basic building blocks of four actors sitting around a table.'</p> <p><strong>Adland's pioneers</strong></p> <p><strong>Ridley Scott</strong></p> <p><strong>Most famous ad:</strong> Hovis</p> <p><strong>Signature films:</strong> Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator</p> <p>Impressive visual stylist.He says: 'Advertising was my film school.

That's changing now, with producer Martha Fiennes and directors Simon West, Simon Monjack and Glazer cleverly using bigger budgets and renewed confidence in the advertising industry to attract the attention of backers and producers. Glazer's first film, Sexy Beast, which was shot in Britain and Europe and opens next month, revisits Guy Ritchie's now familiar Snatch gangland turf but with a terrifying and grown-up ferocity. There are no slow-mo shoot-outs and no mockney camaraderie between handsome young hoods. Instead, extraordinarily, the screenplay emerges triumphant, and characterisation is vindicated as a far more frightening tool than a flip attitude to violence could ever be. So far, the 34-year old Glazer is best known for his award-winning television advertisement for Guinness, called 'Surfer'. It made such an impact last year that recent polls have already pronounced it one of the most popular adverts of all time. Sexy Beast is more technically restrained than 'Surfer' - which features a wave of surf morphing into stampeding white horses - and it also thumbs its nose at the spate of ironic gangster films it follows. Glazer says he was working on the project before the gangster phenomenon began but, by chance, the contrasting tone of Sexy Beast is timely. Far from laddish, it is a world-weary dream, which slides slickly into nightmare. Ray Winstone is Gal Dove, a retired heavy who, while happy in Spain with Amanda Redman, is persuaded back into crime by Ben Kingsley's Don Logan - a portrayal that gives new meaning to the word 'insistent'. Glazer, an art school graduate whose first love was the theatre says he wanted 'the words and the actors' to dominate his debut feature. None the less, the track record of young commercial directors-turned-filmmakers was also in the back of Glazer's mind as he filmed. In the past couple of years Simon West has gone from directing Budweiser ads to making Hollywood blockbusters - Con Air and The General's Daughter. But the visual bombast of West's hits is at odds with most of his peers. Martha Fiennes graduated last year from producing commercials to the historical epic Onegin, starring her brother Ralph. Before them - and with rather more of a fuss - Tony Kaye made the transition from British Rail and Guinness to shoot his first feature film in Hollywood, American History X. In fact Guinness is more than good for prospective film directors. The careers of Hugh Hudson, Alan Parker and Ridley Scott were also enriched by it. And during the Seventies, British television advertising in general functioned as a training ground for Hollywood, honing the talents of Adrian Lyne, Ridley's brother, Tony, and David Puttnam. Yet Glazer's contemporaries, including Simon Monjack, who directed Nike's Michael Jordan campaign, and is also about to release his first feature, Two Days, Nine Lives, have had an even bigger playground at their disposal: the music video. 'In a sense music videos gave me the greatest freedom of all,' says Glazer. 'The sort of freedom you get from having all the time you want to shoot things in the way you want to. It really is a toybox for a director.' Glazer and Jamie Thralls, whose impressive debut The Lowdown is released next year, have both made award-winning videos for Radiohead. Glazer has also worked with Jamiroquai, Blur and Massive Attack. 'There is a greater degree of commercial risk in making an advertisement than a music video, so you are more restricted. Although you are still trying to sneak your own ideas in,' he says. 'I hope I always showed a healthy disrespect for the conventional demands of how to sell something. Instead, I worried about how to construct images that would transcend the industry and be remembered by ordinary people.' The switch to feature films has been 'an education'. For a start, both Glazer and Monjack have had to adjust to the marathon shooting schedule and the comparatively low budgets. 'A Guinness commercial might only take five or six days to shoot,' says Glazer. 'But you actually have more time to get things right. In features, if you want a red car and a white car turns up you just have to use it.' Monjack, whose debut movie is a thoughtful drama about a group of recovering addicts in a rehab clinic, agrees: 'Suddenly you are encouraged to forget all the wonderful things you were once able to do in adverts. After all, I have worked on individual adverts that cost more than the \u00a33m it took to make this film.' The school of advertisement-trained directors does have its faults, as Monjack and Glazer admit. 'We have bad habits,' said Glazer. 'We rely too heavily on cuts. The filmmakers that really inspire me, such as Fellini and Kubrick, have a fluidity and a simplicity.' But there is no question that the advertising alumni have had a major impact, says Gavin Smith, the editor of New York's Film Comment magazine. 'One of the styles that has taken over recently is pastiche,' he says. 'It has taken a hold in comedy and in action films such as Charlie's Angels , and it is influenced by these advertising-trained directors.' In fact, Charlie's Angels was filmed by the Gap ads veteran McG. Not surprisingly Glazer is now being courted by Hollywood. He is currently toying with three projects, one of which is set in Las Vegas but 'has nothing to do with gangsters'. But he has no intention of disavowing his commercial roots. 'If there is a crossover between these worlds, we should not be snobby. After all, Ridley Scott and Spielberg are both still picking up from the hyper-realism of new music videos and advertisements.' And yet Glazer's own first work is clearly a tentative move away from the world of visual hyperbole. If the exuberant expenditure of drinks and car adverts marked the mood of the very end of the last century, the whiz-kids are now learning self-effacement. There is a fresh search for content. 'I wanted to find simplicity in a script to help me get away from excess,' says Glazer. 'I wanted the basic building blocks of four actors sitting around a table.' Adland's pioneers Ridley Scott Most famous ad: Hovis Signature films: Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator Impressive visual stylist.He says: 'Advertising was my film school. I was able to be the insane perfectionist, controlling all the elements in one neat capsule.' Tony Scott Most famous ad: Sure deodorant Signature films: Top Gun, True Romance Films are slick, loud and profitable.

I'm not interested in art for art's sake.' \u0095 Sexy Beast opens on 12 January. Two Days, Nine Lives opens in February",

      "body": "<p>The old mission town town of San Luis Obispo is situated near the Pacific, halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. I've stayed there twice, once driving north in 1958, the second time driving south last year. Neither visit left much of an impression. A few days ago, however, I was invited to contribute some thoughts on motels in the cinema to the Radio 4 programme Front Row, and discovered to my astonishment that the very first motel had been unveiled 75 years ago this week in San Luis Obispo. It was called the Motel Inn, the architect was Arthur Heinman, and each suite had a bathroom, telephone and car-port. Collecting my thoughts, I was surprised by the amount of time I'd spent in motels (mostly by proxy, but some of it real), and by the role they had played in the twentieth century. </p> <p>One of the major changes in the cinema and in real American life has been the shift from the train and the hotel to the car and the motel, from a nation confidently progressing together on a preordained track to an anxious collection of isolated individuals frantically free to make individual journeys in any direction. A hotel is a society in miniature; a house is a symbol of family and continuity; the motel has become a metaphor for angst and alienation. </p> <p>It wasn't always thus. In the pre-war years, the motel (usually called a motor-court and a rustic, timbered place) could be a romantic, hopeful spot. Think of idealistic reporter Clark Gable putting up the 'Wall of Jericho' curtain between himself and fleeing heiress Claudette Colbert in the cabin they shared in Frank Capra's It Happened One Night (1934), or shy academic Gary Cooper proposing to stripper Barbara Stanwyck after accidentally entering her hut in Howard Hawks's Ball of Fire (1941). But things changed. The motel is where an affectless girl comes between friends in Monte Hellman's existential Two-Lane Blacktop (1971), and where the betrayed cadet chooses to commit suicide in Taylor Hackford's An Officer and a Gentleman (1982). </p> <p>Motels are places for assignations and illicit sex, for planning crimes and dividing the spoils, for insecure people in transit or desperate people on the run. There's always the chance that you'll wake up alone, robbed after a night of passion, or that the place will be surrounded by cops (as in Bonnie and Clyde (1967) or this year's Way of the Gun) and you've the choice of shooting it out or getting handcuffed. </p> <p>Fugitives, like the sympathetic heroines of Ridley Scott's Thelma and Louise (1991) or the repellent duo in Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (1994), book in to watch their own legends grow in nightly instalments on TV as they cut their swaths across the country. Motels are located on the edge of cities, identifying their patrons as marginalised, or they are out in the wilds of the Midwest, dwarfed by the big sky and the majestic landscape. </p> <p>Their ugliness is an architectural joke in bad taste that mocks, and is mocked by, the natural world. They have a dispiriting anonymity. At one end of the spectrum are the homogeneous, sanitised-for-your-protection motels belonging to franchised chains that from San Diego up to Maine bear the logos of Howard Johnson and Ramada and offer identical services to America's middle-class tourists and protect them from local colour. At the other end of the spectrum - the one preferred by most Hollywood filmmakers - the rooms are squalid, cigarette-scarred, kitsch-decorated, the thin-walled suites located behind flickering neon signs and fetid swimming pools. </p> <p>The upmarket places were acidly satirised in Richard Lester's Petulia (1968), where would-be adulterers George C. Scott and Julie Christie book into a San Francisco motel so impersonal that you never meet the staff or other guests. The experience of staying in downmarket versions is cleverly caught in Christopher Nolan's Memento (2000), whose protagonist suffers from short-term memory loss and has to take Polaroids so he can recognise the LA motel he's living in. </p> <p>The motel started to peak cinematically in the late 1950s. The perceptive Louis Malle, creating the first ripple of the French New Wave, wanted to present a new, Americanised Paris in his 1958 debut, the thriller Lift to the Scaffold. So he shot against a background of modern buildings and neon-lit bars and persuaded Miles Davis to provide a score. Having recently visited the States, he wanted a pair of mixed-up teenagers to find a gun in the glove compartment of an American convertible they steal and to use it for a random killing at a motel outside Paris. He found that France's only motel was in Normandy and rather than build a set near the capital he shot it there. </p> <p>Curiously, Malle's picture preceded the two greatest American motel movies, both made by directors he revered. In Orson Welles's last Hollywood film, A Touch of Evil (1958), upright Mexican narcotics cop Charlton Heston takes his American wife Janet Leigh from an evil border town to the sanctuary of a small remote motel. Then leaves her without a car. Big mistake. The manager is a twitching maniac played by Dennis Weaver, and a band of leather-clad drug fiends move in to put her in mortal danger. She survives, as you can see tonight at 11.55pm on BBC2, in the definitive version of Welles's masterpiece. </p> <p>Leigh waasn't so lucky two years later. Seeking a safe haven, she checked into the Bates motel, going to the earliest cinematic grave ever visited on a movie star and gaining immortality in Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). Anthony Perkins, clearly influenced by Weaver, creates an archetypal figure as the dodgy pro prietor, reminding us that Vladimir Nabokov had noted that 'motor-court operators' fall into three categories - 'the reformed criminal, the retired teacher and the business flop'. </p> <p>Significantly, Hitchcock, in shooting the trailer for Psycho , excluded the actors and any scenes from the film. He concentrated on the motel, conducting the audience around the set, contrasting the sinister gothic house on the hill with the unthreatening motel in the foreground.For him, the motel and the house were characters too. </p> <p>Since the 1950s, a genre has grown up to celebrate this motel culture - the road movie - and a rich repertory of actors has sprung up to inhabit it and provide it with a sweaty, fleshy, lived-in dimension. They include Ed Harris, Harry Dean Stanton, Steve McQueen, Harvey Keitel, Warren Oates, Woody Harrelson, Jeff Bridges, Randy Quaid, Stacey Keach, Tommy Lee Jones, Tuesday Weld, Will Patton, Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Dennis Hopper and Kris Kristofferson. Kristofferson's 'Me and Bobby McGee' became the theme of life on the road and was the defining motif of Two-Lane Blacktop . </p> <p>Anyone who's visited America has a pungent memory of an encounter at a roadside diner or motel. The extreme forms are to be found in two classic road movies of the Seventies. In Bob Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces (1970), Jack Nicholson famously humiliates an overly punctilious waitress. In Martin Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974), Ellen Burstyn, who won an Oscar in the role, is on the receiving end. Beaten up in a motel room by her new lover, Harvey Keitel, she then absorbs insults and injuries as a waitress in an Arizona diner. </p> <p>Three figures command this terrain. All country singers and balladeers are part of it, but Frank Zappa broke new ground with his album about his life on tour with the Mothers of Invention. This led to 200 Motels (1971) which he co-directed with Tony Palmer. It's an amusing time-capsule of a picture. </p> <p>More important are the contributions of Vladimir Nabokov and Sam Shepard. Nabokov's Lolita (1955) is not only one of the last century's greatest novels, it's also an unparalleled account of life on the road in postwar America. </p> <p> Nabokov, the fastidious prose commentator on life in the hinterlands as observed from a car window, is dealing with aberrant sexuality. The novel's narrator, the smug paedophile Humbert Humbert, seeks to disguise his perverse attractions to his New England nymphet by absorbing her into the confused texture of the motel, though he admits that Lolita prefers 'real' hotels. </p> <p>Born during the Second World War, Sam Shepard, one of America's greatest playwrights, grew up on the road, moving from place to place with his parents, a US soldier and his wife. In the early 1980s, he drifted around the south-west, recording his autobiographical reflections in a series of poems, essays and stories he published as Motel Chronicles (1982). Shepard became the poet laureate of the motel world. </p> <p>His finest single play, Fool for Love (1983), is about an incestuous affair between a brother and his half-sister, set in a dilapidated motel. This is a Greek tragedy transposed to the American south-west, and the role of its loser hero, a failed rodeo performer, was created on the San Francisco stage by Ed Harris, performed off-Broadway by Will Patton and played in Robert Altman's 1986 movie by Shepard. </p> <p><strong>Taking a drive</strong></p> <p>The first motel ever is situated on US 101 at San Luis Obispo in California - half way between San Francisco and Los Angeles - and was built in 1925 and originally called the Milestone Motel (it is now known as the Motel Inn). The architect was Arthur Heinman and the Spanish revival building cost him about $80,000. </p> <p>For $1.25 a night travellers got a two-room bungalow with a kitchen and private adjoining garage. The units faced on to a central courtyard with a swimming pool and picnic tables. </p> <p>In 1934 visionary architect Frank Lloyd Wright incorporated a motel in his design for a utopian city called Broadacre. Lloyd Wright planned a ramp for visitors to drive their cars virtually into their motel rooms. </p> <p>Britain's most famous motel is probably the fictitious Crossroads motel, allegedly sited near Birmingham and the venue of ATV's soap opera that ran from 1964-88 - attracting over 17 million viewers at its peak. </p> <p>Poet Joseph Brodsky advocates there should be a poetry book 'in every room in every motel in the land'.</p>",

Think of idealistic reporter Clark Gable putting up the 'Wall of Jericho' curtain between himself and fleeing heiress Claudette Colbert in the cabin they shared in Frank Capra's It Happened One Night (1934), or shy academic Gary Cooper proposing to stripper Barbara Stanwyck after accidentally entering her hut in Howard Hawks's Ball of Fire (1941). But things changed. The motel is where an affectless girl comes between friends in Monte Hellman's existential Two-Lane Blacktop (1971), and where the betrayed cadet chooses to commit suicide in Taylor Hackford's An Officer and a Gentleman (1982). Motels are places for assignations and illicit sex, for planning crimes and dividing the spoils, for insecure people in transit or desperate people on the run. There's always the chance that you'll wake up alone, robbed after a night of passion, or that the place will be surrounded by cops (as in Bonnie and Clyde (1967) or this year's Way of the Gun) and you've the choice of shooting it out or getting handcuffed. Fugitives, like the sympathetic heroines of Ridley Scott's Thelma and Louise (1991) or the repellent duo in Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (1994), book in to watch their own legends grow in nightly instalments on TV as they cut their swaths across the country. Motels are located on the edge of cities, identifying their patrons as marginalised, or they are out in the wilds of the Midwest, dwarfed by the big sky and the majestic landscape. Their ugliness is an architectural joke in bad taste that mocks, and is mocked by, the natural world. They have a dispiriting anonymity. At one end of the spectrum are the homogeneous, sanitised-for-your-protection motels belonging to franchised chains that from San Diego up to Maine bear the logos of Howard Johnson and Ramada and offer identical services to America's middle-class tourists and protect them from local colour. At the other end of the spectrum - the one preferred by most Hollywood filmmakers - the rooms are squalid, cigarette-scarred, kitsch-decorated, the thin-walled suites located behind flickering neon signs and fetid swimming pools. The upmarket places were acidly satirised in Richard Lester's Petulia (1968), where would-be adulterers George C. Scott and Julie Christie book into a San Francisco motel so impersonal that you never meet the staff or other guests. The experience of staying in downmarket versions is cleverly caught in Christopher Nolan's Memento (2000), whose protagonist suffers from short-term memory loss and has to take Polaroids so he can recognise the LA motel he's living in. The motel started to peak cinematically in the late 1950s. The perceptive Louis Malle, creating the first ripple of the French New Wave, wanted to present a new, Americanised Paris in his 1958 debut, the thriller Lift to the Scaffold. So he shot against a background of modern buildings and neon-lit bars and persuaded Miles Davis to provide a score. Having recently visited the States, he wanted a pair of mixed-up teenagers to find a gun in the glove compartment of an American convertible they steal and to use it for a random killing at a motel outside Paris. He found that France's only motel was in Normandy and rather than build a set near the capital he shot it there. Curiously, Malle's picture preceded the two greatest American motel movies, both made by directors he revered. In Orson Welles's last Hollywood film, A Touch of Evil (1958), upright Mexican narcotics cop Charlton Heston takes his American wife Janet Leigh from an evil border town to the sanctuary of a small remote motel. Then leaves her without a car. Big mistake. The manager is a twitching maniac played by Dennis Weaver, and a band of leather-clad drug fiends move in to put her in mortal danger. She survives, as you can see tonight at 11.55pm on BBC2, in the definitive version of Welles's masterpiece. Leigh waasn't so lucky two years later. Seeking a safe haven, she checked into the Bates motel, going to the earliest cinematic grave ever visited on a movie star and gaining immortality in Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). Anthony Perkins, clearly influenced by Weaver, creates an archetypal figure as the dodgy pro prietor, reminding us that Vladimir Nabokov had noted that 'motor-court operators' fall into three categories - 'the reformed criminal, the retired teacher and the business flop'. Significantly, Hitchcock, in shooting the trailer for Psycho , excluded the actors and any scenes from the film. He concentrated on the motel, conducting the audience around the set, contrasting the sinister gothic house on the hill with the unthreatening motel in the foreground.For him, the motel and the house were characters too. Since the 1950s, a genre has grown up to celebrate this motel culture - the road movie - and a rich repertory of actors has sprung up to inhabit it and provide it with a sweaty, fleshy, lived-in dimension. They include Ed Harris, Harry Dean Stanton, Steve McQueen, Harvey Keitel, Warren Oates, Woody Harrelson, Jeff Bridges, Randy Quaid, Stacey Keach, Tommy Lee Jones, Tuesday Weld, Will Patton, Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton, Dennis Hopper and Kris Kristofferson. Kristofferson's 'Me and Bobby McGee' became the theme of life on the road and was the defining motif of Two-Lane Blacktop . Anyone who's visited America has a pungent memory of an encounter at a roadside diner or motel. The extreme forms are to be found in two classic road movies of the Seventies. In Bob Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces (1970), Jack Nicholson famously humiliates an overly punctilious waitress. In Martin Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974), Ellen Burstyn, who won an Oscar in the role, is on the receiving end. Beaten up in a motel room by her new lover, Harvey Keitel, she then absorbs insults and injuries as a waitress in an Arizona diner. Three figures command this terrain. All country singers and balladeers are part of it, but Frank Zappa broke new ground with his album about his life on tour with the Mothers of Invention. This led to 200 Motels (1971) which he co-directed with Tony Palmer. It's an amusing time-capsule of a picture. More important are the contributions of Vladimir Nabokov and Sam Shepard. Nabokov's Lolita (1955) is not only one of the last century's greatest novels, it's also an unparalleled account of life on the road in postwar America. Nabokov, the fastidious prose commentator on life in the hinterlands as observed from a car window, is dealing with aberrant sexuality. The novel's narrator, the smug paedophile Humbert Humbert, seeks to disguise his perverse attractions to his New England nymphet by absorbing her into the confused texture of the motel, though he admits that Lolita prefers 'real' hotels. Born during the Second World War, Sam Shepard, one of America's greatest playwrights, grew up on the road, moving from place to place with his parents, a US soldier and his wife. In the early 1980s, he drifted around the south-west, recording his autobiographical reflections in a series of poems, essays and stories he published as Motel Chronicles (1982). Shepard became the poet laureate of the motel world. His finest single play, Fool for Love (1983), is about an incestuous affair between a brother and his half-sister, set in a dilapidated motel. This is a Greek tragedy transposed to the American south-west, and the role of its loser hero, a failed rodeo performer, was created on the San Francisco stage by Ed Harris, performed off-Broadway by Will Patton and played in Robert Altman's 1986 movie by Shepard. Taking a drive The first motel ever is situated on US 101 at San Luis Obispo in California - half way between San Francisco and Los Angeles - and was built in 1925 and originally called the Milestone Motel (it is now known as the Motel Inn). The architect was Arthur Heinman and the Spanish revival building cost him about $80,000. For $1.25 a night travellers got a two-room bungalow with a kitchen and private adjoining garage. The units faced on to a central courtyard with a swimming pool and picnic tables. In 1934 visionary architect Frank Lloyd Wright incorporated a motel in his design for a utopian city called Broadacre. Lloyd Wright planned a ramp for visitors to drive their cars virtually into their motel rooms. Britain's most famous motel is probably the fictitious Crossroads motel, allegedly sited near Birmingham and the venue of ATV's soap opera that ran from 1964-88 - attracting over 17 million viewers at its peak. Poet Joseph Brodsky advocates there should be a poetry book 'in every room in every motel in the land'.",

He's a blood brother to those outrageous US Marine Corps dads played by Robert Duvall in The Great Santini (he was also married to Danner) and Chris Cooper in American Beauty.

      "body": "<p>My role for the first 15 minutes was to sit there poleaxed, thinking may-be he is brain-damaged. He was chattering 19 to the dozen, pulling faces, switching voices, sometimes talking in camp actor tones, sometimes shouting like he did in The Young Ones, sometimes putting his face close to mine and whispering, then leaping up and pacing about, striking poses, hugging himself, then throwing himself back in his chair. And whenever he forgot a name he shouted: 'Come on, brain!', which certainly made me go 'Ouch,' thinking of the terrible brain trauma when he fell off his quadbike and was in a coma for five days. He was telling endless luvvie anecdotes, hopping from one to the other, dropping names which meant nothing to me, generally 'wibbling' as he calls it, determined not to let me get a word in edgeways. But gradually I was able to lob in the odd question and, even more gradually, he started answering them in his own elliptical way. </p> <p>At one point he said, movingly, 'Can't you see? I'm frightened of interviews. I'm so frightened, I'm making you nervous.' And it was true. Of course he is extra frightened of interviews now, because he hates talking about his accident; but he was always frightened of interviews, saying, 'I don't want people to know who I am.'</p> <p>Ade Edmondson says he always lies in interviews anyway, to make himself more interesting. Like most actors, he thinks he's boring; like most actors, he's more obsessed with his career than he wants to let on. But, unlike most actors, he is terrified of sounding pretentious - he has a mental audience of fellow comedians ready to fall about laughing if he says anything serious. So whenever we approach serious ground, he leaps up and creates a diversion - once, most alarmingly, by rolling the top of his ear lobe and pushing it into his ear. </p> <p>We were on the stage of the Richmond Theatre, because he was doing a play there, A Family Affair. It has been on tour, but will not come the West End, because he starts filming Harry Potter in January. He is very excited about doing Harry Potter , even though he has a small part (Peeves), because ' Everyone is in it!' But he is even more excited, in fact deeply heartfeltly grateful, to be back on stage. A Family Affair is the first theatre work he has done since his accident and marks an important milestone in his recovery. </p> <p>Annoyingly, though, we are supposed to be talking about his new children's film, Merlin, The Return, which comes out at Christmas, and there is a film company PR hovering about to make sure that we do. At one point, the PR pops out and Rik starts raving about the theatre, and then, as soon as the PR returns, he switches smoothly mid-sentence to, '... and that's why Merlin was my happiest film experience'. But, actually, he filmed it over a year ago - it was one of the first things he did after his accident - so it is ancient history now and there is a lot of, 'Come on, brain!' while he struggles to remember the names. Anyway, it's an engaging film, with lots of sword fights and battles and horses, and brilliant special effects. His own children, Rosie, 13, Sidney, 11 and Bonnie, 4, all loved it - 'And not just because Daddy told them to.' </p> <p>But he says it's been really odd, doing this theatre tour, that so many people have come up to him and said, 'Ah, Rik, it's really nice to see you back,' when he thinks he's been back for two years. But mainly he's been filming abroad, and some of the films haven't come out yet. The accident, which almost killed him, happened in April 1998, soon after his 40th birthday. He had just joined his family at their holiday home in Devon and went off for a ride on his quad bike. </p> <p>Shortly afterwards, his wife glanced out of the window and saw the bike upside down in the yard and him unconscious underneath it. He had suffered a fractured skull and two brain haemorrhages. There were doubts at first about whether he would live, and then about whether he would be permanently brain damaged. </p> <p>He woke from his coma to see his wife Barbara, his parents, and his old friend Ade Edmondson all in tears round his bed. Over the next few days in hospital, he thought he was being held prisoner and kept trying to escape - once he asked his son Sidney, then aged nine, to bring a getaway car. When he was transferred to a hospital in London (pulling faces and mooning out of the ambulance window en route), he did escape, walked out and got a taxi home. His wife pretended everything was fine till he went to bed, then called an ambulance and got him back to hospital.</p> <p>For the first few weeks, he was high as a kite, with an attention span of zero and a habit of scrambling his words - he would ask for a bike when he meant a biscuit, and (a good Freudian touch) asked his wife for some lesbians when he wanted a piece of paper. Ade Edmondson says that in the first weeks he made good progress but then he seemed to stick for a long time at a sort of eight-year-old phase, and everyone was desperately worried that that was as far as he'd get. But then he started improving again and, eventually, five months after the accident, was able to think about work. </p> <p>He says that his 'primary terror' all the time he was convalescing was that he would never be able to act again - and acting was all he had ever done. So it was a nervous moment when he sat down with his beloved agent, Aude Powell, and went through the job offers. 'It was really brain-shredding. I didn't know whether I'd be able to read and be in character. And I did a little voiceover for some kids' stuff and I had to play two frogs - which, at the time, felt demanding - because one of them talked like this [deep voice] and one talked like this [squeaky voice] and it was quite, you know, technical . So, that was making me nervous. But I went in and did it and I've never been so fucking happy in my life! That was September 1998 and I thought I can fucking do it! My life was back.' </p> <p>He did a cameo spot in BBC1's Jonathan Creek, then made the film Guest House Paradiso with his old mucker Ade Edmondson. Ade directed and arranged the schedule so Rik could do most of his scenes in the morning, when he was at his best, then have lunch alone and sleep. And he organised a masseuse to loosen him up for the fight scenes. 'Ade was just really - but discreetly - caring. Well, of course he was, he's my best mate.' Unfortunately, the film was panned, but that doesn't seem to have bothered them - they are now planning another excremental epic about sending shit into space. One of the great advantages of being at the Richmond Theatre, Rik says, is that Ade lives nearby and they can write together again while Ade's wife Jennifer Saunders is off touring with Dawn French. </p> <p>Ade said last year that Rik was 'still slightly odd. Not odd, but his memory is not the same and he finds it difficult to concentrate if there is more than one stimulus in the room.' I noticed the latter while I was talking to him - a car alarm went off in the street and he yelped, 'Whadda fuck is that?' and was very jittery till it stopped. Also, he suddenly started pronouncing the name of the film Merlynn , though maybe he was being funny. Once or twice, he seemed to have lost the conversational plot and started re-answering questions he'd answered earlier, but I imagine he was always pretty scatty anyway.</p> <p>But obviously there are, he says, differences in his life now. He likes to spend silent time alone, drawing. 'I'm afraid it's not very rock'n'roll. I'd like to say to relax I steal cars and get out of my face on crack and rob banks, but I don't - I doodle, I draw. I like expressing myself. I'm just very very interested in me , I'm afraid. Pathetic, isn't it?' And he likes solitude more than he used to, perhaps because of the accident, or perhaps simply because of ageing. 'When you're an experienced celeb - which I am - you sometimes just need a bit of space, when you're not \"on\". I'm always on! I'm walking down the high street and someone might come up and say, \"Hello, Rik!\" And do I want to say, \"Fuck off?\" No.' </p> <p>Another major difference is that he can no longer drink because he is on anti-epilepsy pills, Phenytoin, which stop working if mixed with alcohol. He was a very happy drinker before - 'I liked to get pissed, misbehave, get overexcited and mess about. But I wasn't drinking a bottle of vodka for breakfast. I wasn't pissed when I fell off the bike.' And now he feels that staying sober is a small price to pay to avoid epilepsy. 'If you've ever had an epileptic fit, it's really fucking terrifying, because you don't know where you're going, your systems fail you. We're in a very difficult area now, because it's in my interests as an actor not to say that I am liable to epilepsy. Because otherwise people might say, \"Oh, I was going to ask him to play Hamlet!\" But I have had a couple of seizures. And it's always when I forget to take the pills.' </p> <p>The first was last year, when he was in a recording studio, luckily very near his house in Ladbroke Grove, west London, and felt peculiar. He said he'd better go home and someone walked him to his front door, and he went upstairs and got as far as his daughter Rosie's room and lay down on the bed. Barbara was out, taking the kids to school, and when she got back, 'She heard, \"Doongadoongadoonga...\" from upstairs and she goes upstairs and she realises it's coming from Rosie's bedroom - \"Doongadoonga\" - and she looks through the crack in the door and there's me on the bed banging up and down and she thinks, \"No! No ! Surely not! Wanking on our daughter's bed? I'll have to shoot him!\" And then - she says this by her own admission - she thought, \"Oh, thank God, he's only having an epileptic fit!\" [He recounts all this with roars of laughter.] So she called the ambulance boys and they came in and smacked her because she had her finger in my mouth trying to stop me biting my tongue - mustn't do that, because these people are strong ! </p> <p>'So, next time it happened, I knew what was coming. I was at Gatwick airport, flying out to Canada to do Kevin of the North earlier this year. I shouldn't be telling you this, really, but I will. I was by the bookstall, and I couldn't tell the difference between colour and sound. I could see the colour of sound, and I could hear the things I could see, and I knew it was declining, my ability to understand what was going on. And I went up to a complete and utter stranger - whoever it was, thank you - and said, \"You've got to help me.\" I had to decide what to say, and think how to say it - \"You've got to help me\" sounds easy. I got it out somehow, and then I collapsed.' </p> <p>Anyway, he says, 'It turned out fab,' because the film company paid for Barbara to accompany him to Canada and she brought Bonnie, the youngest, and they all had a good time. But, obviously, epilepsy remains an ever-present worry. He will have a three-year check-up next Easter, and perhaps slowly come off the Phenytoin, but he would rather stay on the pills and not drink than risk another fit. 'I mean, yeah, it's a bit of a complete fucking nightmare drag not to have a pint, but I have found a way of taking great pleasure in it. I have never woken up with a hangover, which is great. I am cleverer, fitter, healthier. I have more coherent time. I'm very very happy now. </p> <p>There's also something - whether it was my parents, or my school, or my friends - that has taught me, or bred me, to be optimistic. And combative. So that when something shitty happens, the very fact of dealing with it is good for you.' </p> <p>Suddenly he breaks off irritably, and says, almost to himself, 'I'm constantly talking about this - yayayaya. That's my next job - to give up cowardice.' Cowardice? 'Because I should be nicer to myself than that. I mean, stop apologising. I'm frightened of being interviewed, can't you see?' </p> <p>I think I see - he wants to give up the cowardice of always being too nice, too obliging; he wants to gain the courage to tell people like me to fuck off. He resents being made to be serious. He was never meant to be a thinker - when he left school, he threw his satchel into the River Severn and vowed never to read a book again - he wants to go back to being a happy little airhead. But, of course, ageing is against him, quite apart from his accident - he can never be that careless innocent again. </p> <p> It is very striking, reading his old interviews, to see how often before his accident he used to say he'd had a charmed life. He told The Mail, in 1993, 'I had a very happy childhood, happy teenage years and I was famous by the time I was 22. A charmed life.' And he told The Independent , 'My tradge as a celeb is that nothing terrible ever happened. I've just had a very nice time.' He grew up in Droitwich, Worcestershire, with an older brother and two younger sisters. His parents were both teachers - his father was head of drama at a teachers' training college, and encouraged him to act. Aged eight, he had to come on stage as a beggar boy and rummage in a dustbin and find a bar of chocolate and smear it round his face, and he got a big laugh and everyone was pleased so, naturally, he thought, 'This is the job for me.' </p> <p>He had a happy time at King's School, Worcester, and then he read drama at Manchester University and teamed up with Ade Edmondson and wrote The Young Ones and was a star by the time he was 22. There was one messy period when he was having an affair with Barbara Robbin, a make-up artist, while still living with his first partner, Lise Mayer, and they both got pregnant at the same time. He ditched Lise, married Barbara, and Lise lost her baby. But Lise eventually forgave him and he is obviously deeply happy with 'my Barb'. So, yes - a charmed life. </p> <p>But it is quite unusual to go round saying you've had a charmed life - most people who've had one take it for granted. But, he explains: 'I've always tried not to be complacent. Because I think good lefties are not complacent or, if they were, they would try to get rid of it. Not that I am a red exactly, but...' And he suddenly leaps up, worried that he is getting too serious, and starts shouting, 'I am deeply honoured and proud of the fact that Benjy [Ben Elton] and Harry [Enfield] got asked to No 10 Downing Street, and they didn't ask me. Yeah! Yeah! I'm still too fucking dangerous! The only reason they didn't ask me is because I might be baaaaaad !' And he leaps around the stage, strutting and snarling and sticking his crotch out like Rick in The Young Ones. </p> <p>I sit there, smiling indulgently, thinking, why does he do it? This was a question that puzzled me even when he was in his thirties, and even more now he is in his forties. Why does he keep going back to this role - be it Rick in The Young Ones or Rich in Filthy Rich and Catflap or Richie in Bottom - they're all the same, really. It seems to play the part in his psyche that, say, Dame Edna plays for Barry Humphries. It is a role - but it's a role that he also uses in real life, as a way of being rude and aggressive without being offensive because he is 'only joking'. Is that why he does it - as a form of release? 'Yes - all that evil stuff, the violence and so on - you can't just leave that bit, it's got to come out.' </p> <p>But it has another effect too - it's a way of sort of desexualising himself. He is an extremely handsome man - in fact mesmerisingly attractive - but it is as if he doesn't want people to know it, or as if he doesn't want to acknowledge it. His handsomeness came as a revelation when he appeared as Alan B'Stard in The New Statesmen - I remember thinking then, 'My God, he could be a sex symbol!' But he immediately reverted to another Rick role with Ade Edmondson as if he wanted to obliterate that idea.</p> <p>Often, throughout his career, he has shown the potential to be a very good straight actor. Richard Eyre, who directed him in The Government Inspector at the National Theatre in 1985, found him 'prodigiously gifted, intelligent'; Harold Pinter, when he saw him in Cell Mates, said he was the 'bee's knees' and Simon Gray, who wrote and directed the play, said he was 'a great actor, and a valiant man'. Time and again, he has surprised critics by being able to play serious roles better than anyone expected (he was particularly good as Mickey Love, an ageing game-show host, in his series Rik Mayall Presents), and yet time and again, just when he seems on the brink of being taken seriously as an actor, he reverts to rock bottom with Ade Edmondson. </p> <p>The usual theory is that this is out of loyalty to Ade, who has never really developed a solo career, but I'm not so sure. Rik obviously loves Ade deeply and says unblushingly that their on-screen relationship is like a marriage, with him as the wife. He also seems to respect Ade as the greater intellect - Ade, he always reminds interviewers, got a 2:1 from Manchester, whereas he got a 2:2. It seems crazy that it should matter 20 years down the line, but evidently it does. Ade is brighter, he insists, and also more organised.</p> <p>'He looks after me and I look after him, but he doesn't really need me to look after him - except to be his mate. Without being too sexist about it, he's the bloke and I'm the girl. I'm technically incompetent but emotionally believe myself to be in command. He is technically extremely competent and actually in command, but far too wily to let me know that. But it's a complete 50:50. He types, I pace.' So will he and Ade go on writing lavatory humour till they drop? Yes , he roars, 'It's not all lavatory humour! Some of it's violent! We're growing older now and we need to do something about being old and violent and angry.' And, as he has already admitted, he needs the release for 'all that evil stuff'. </p> <p>But, I told him, you are handsome enough to have had a straight-hero career - 'Yes. Go on!' he beams - but you seem to deliberately sabotage it. 'Ah well,' he says, suddenly dropping all his shouting and diversions, 'You've got me all serious now because you said I was handsome. Um. I've only ever done what I wanted to do. And I'm not being falsely modest when I say I'm not the world's most intelligent man. I'm much more emotional than I am cranial. And I'm probably not capable of having a plan. I never wrote The Young Ones because I wanted to be Alan B'Stard later. I never wanted people to think I'm sexy. I think it embarrassed me, actually, wanting to show off, display how gorgeous and lovely I am. I could not do that!' </p> <p>Why not? Because Ade would give him a bad time? 'Oh, damn right! But so would the audience. If I had set out purely to be attractive, desired , then I would have gone out of fashion by now. I would have been, oh, the face of 1984 - and now what I am going to do? All I really want is - fucking hell this is going to look so wanky! - but it's true. Like Henri, in this play, [ A Family Affair ] is a lonely, selfish, resentful, unhappy man and - forgive me - but it's emotional exercise, it's like going for a run, taking your emotions for a workout. Or finding things out about yourself. Stage acting especially - the beauty of stage acting is that you don't have a commander. There's no one getting you up at four in the morning and saying, 'What I want you to do, Rik, is stand on that mark, then look to the right, a little wistfully. OK?' And that's your fucking work for the day! But with the audience, it's: \"I think I'll get everyone to think I'm great.\" I like doing what I do, and I don't like being told what to do. But circumstances have forced me to. No ! They haven't! I'm very fierce about my independence.' </p> <p>Oh, I have got the hang of him now - he meant to say circumstances have forced him to do films rather than plays since his accident, but he won't say it because it sounds self-pitying. And also, as he is dutifully aware, he is supposed to be publicising Merlin . As if on cue, the PR interrupts to say the photo-grapher has arrived. I try to delay my farewell by asking for a glass of water, and Rik says 'Yes, me too, but I'll have slightly more than Lynn. Because I am famous .' As soon as the PR has gone, he starts raving again about having an audience - 'It's so sensual. You can feel what might make them sad, or excited, or scared - you sense them, you find out what they're like. It's intercourse! Because I give them what they want and they give it back to me.' And then the PR comes back and he switches smoothly to talking about Merlin and then it is time for me to go - just when I was beginning to delude myself that I understood him.</p> <p>\u0095 Merlin, The Return opens on 22 December.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My role for the first 15 minutes was to sit there poleaxed, thinking may-be he is brain-damaged. He was chattering 19 to the dozen, pulling faces, switching voices, sometimes talking in camp actor tones, sometimes shouting like he did in The Young Ones, sometimes putting his face close to mine and whispering, then leaping up and pacing about, striking poses, hugging himself, then throwing himself back in his chair. And whenever he forgot a name he shouted: 'Come on, brain!', which certainly made me go 'Ouch,' thinking of the terrible brain trauma when he fell off his quadbike and was in a coma for five days. He was telling endless luvvie anecdotes, hopping from one to the other, dropping names which meant nothing to me, generally 'wibbling' as he calls it, determined not to let me get a word in edgeways. But gradually I was able to lob in the odd question and, even more gradually, he started answering them in his own elliptical way. At one point he said, movingly, 'Can't you see? I'm frightened of interviews. I'm so frightened, I'm making you nervous.' And it was true. Of course he is extra frightened of interviews now, because he hates talking about his accident; but he was always frightened of interviews, saying, 'I don't want people to know who I am.' Ade Edmondson says he always lies in interviews anyway, to make himself more interesting. Like most actors, he thinks he's boring; like most actors, he's more obsessed with his career than he wants to let on. But, unlike most actors, he is terrified of sounding pretentious - he has a mental audience of fellow comedians ready to fall about laughing if he says anything serious. So whenever we approach serious ground, he leaps up and creates a diversion - once, most alarmingly, by rolling the top of his ear lobe and pushing it into his ear. We were on the stage of the Richmond Theatre, because he was doing a play there, A Family Affair. It has been on tour, but will not come the West End, because he starts filming Harry Potter in January. He is very excited about doing Harry Potter , even though he has a small part (Peeves), because ' Everyone is in it!' But he is even more excited, in fact deeply heartfeltly grateful, to be back on stage. A Family Affair is the first theatre work he has done since his accident and marks an important milestone in his recovery. Annoyingly, though, we are supposed to be talking about his new children's film, Merlin, The Return, which comes out at Christmas, and there is a film company PR hovering about to make sure that we do. At one point, the PR pops out and Rik starts raving about the theatre, and then, as soon as the PR returns, he switches smoothly mid-sentence to, '... and that's why Merlin was my happiest film experience'. But, actually, he filmed it over a year ago - it was one of the first things he did after his accident - so it is ancient history now and there is a lot of, 'Come on, brain!' while he struggles to remember the names. Anyway, it's an engaging film, with lots of sword fights and battles and horses, and brilliant special effects. His own children, Rosie, 13, Sidney, 11 and Bonnie, 4, all loved it - 'And not just because Daddy told them to.' But he says it's been really odd, doing this theatre tour, that so many people have come up to him and said, 'Ah, Rik, it's really nice to see you back,' when he thinks he's been back for two years. But mainly he's been filming abroad, and some of the films haven't come out yet. The accident, which almost killed him, happened in April 1998, soon after his 40th birthday. He had just joined his family at their holiday home in Devon and went off for a ride on his quad bike. Shortly afterwards, his wife glanced out of the window and saw the bike upside down in the yard and him unconscious underneath it. He had suffered a fractured skull and two brain haemorrhages. There were doubts at first about whether he would live, and then about whether he would be permanently brain damaged. He woke from his coma to see his wife Barbara, his parents, and his old friend Ade Edmondson all in tears round his bed. Over the next few days in hospital, he thought he was being held prisoner and kept trying to escape - once he asked his son Sidney, then aged nine, to bring a getaway car. When he was transferred to a hospital in London (pulling faces and mooning out of the ambulance window en route), he did escape, walked out and got a taxi home. His wife pretended everything was fine till he went to bed, then called an ambulance and got him back to hospital. For the first few weeks, he was high as a kite, with an attention span of zero and a habit of scrambling his words - he would ask for a bike when he meant a biscuit, and (a good Freudian touch) asked his wife for some lesbians when he wanted a piece of paper. Ade Edmondson says that in the first weeks he made good progress but then he seemed to stick for a long time at a sort of eight-year-old phase, and everyone was desperately worried that that was as far as he'd get. But then he started improving again and, eventually, five months after the accident, was able to think about work. He says that his 'primary terror' all the time he was convalescing was that he would never be able to act again - and acting was all he had ever done. So it was a nervous moment when he sat down with his beloved agent, Aude Powell, and went through the job offers. 'It was really brain-shredding. I didn't know whether I'd be able to read and be in character. And I did a little voiceover for some kids' stuff and I had to play two frogs - which, at the time, felt demanding - because one of them talked like this [deep voice] and one talked like this [squeaky voice] and it was quite, you know, technical . So, that was making me nervous. But I went in and did it and I've never been so fucking happy in my life! That was September 1998 and I thought I can fucking do it! My life was back.' He did a cameo spot in BBC1's Jonathan Creek, then made the film Guest House Paradiso with his old mucker Ade Edmondson. Ade directed and arranged the schedule so Rik could do most of his scenes in the morning, when he was at his best, then have lunch alone and sleep. And he organised a masseuse to loosen him up for the fight scenes. 'Ade was just really - but discreetly - caring. Well, of course he was, he's my best mate.' Unfortunately, the film was panned, but that doesn't seem to have bothered them - they are now planning another excremental epic about sending shit into space. One of the great advantages of being at the Richmond Theatre, Rik says, is that Ade lives nearby and they can write together again while Ade's wife Jennifer Saunders is off touring with Dawn French. Ade said last year that Rik was 'still slightly odd. Not odd, but his memory is not the same and he finds it difficult to concentrate if there is more than one stimulus in the room.' I noticed the latter while I was talking to him - a car alarm went off in the street and he yelped, 'Whadda fuck is that?' and was very jittery till it stopped. Also, he suddenly started pronouncing the name of the film Merlynn , though maybe he was being funny. Once or twice, he seemed to have lost the conversational plot and started re-answering questions he'd answered earlier, but I imagine he was always pretty scatty anyway. But obviously there are, he says, differences in his life now. He likes to spend silent time alone, drawing. 'I'm afraid it's not very rock'n'roll. I'd like to say to relax I steal cars and get out of my face on crack and rob banks, but I don't - I doodle, I draw. I like expressing myself. I'm just very very interested in me , I'm afraid. Pathetic, isn't it?' And he likes solitude more than he used to, perhaps because of the accident, or perhaps simply because of ageing. 'When you're an experienced celeb - which I am - you sometimes just need a bit of space, when you're not \"on\". I'm always on! I'm walking down the high street and someone might come up and say, \"Hello, Rik!\" And do I want to say, \"Fuck off?\" No.' Another major difference is that he can no longer drink because he is on anti-epilepsy pills, Phenytoin, which stop working if mixed with alcohol. He was a very happy drinker before - 'I liked to get pissed, misbehave, get overexcited and mess about. But I wasn't drinking a bottle of vodka for breakfast. I wasn't pissed when I fell off the bike.' And now he feels that staying sober is a small price to pay to avoid epilepsy. 'If you've ever had an epileptic fit, it's really fucking terrifying, because you don't know where you're going, your systems fail you. We're in a very difficult area now, because it's in my interests as an actor not to say that I am liable to epilepsy. Because otherwise people might say, \"Oh, I was going to ask him to play Hamlet!\" But I have had a couple of seizures. And it's always when I forget to take the pills.' The first was last year, when he was in a recording studio, luckily very near his house in Ladbroke Grove, west London, and felt peculiar. He said he'd better go home and someone walked him to his front door, and he went upstairs and got as far as his daughter Rosie's room and lay down on the bed. Barbara was out, taking the kids to school, and when she got back, 'She heard, \"Doongadoongadoonga...\" from upstairs and she goes upstairs and she realises it's coming from Rosie's bedroom - \"Doongadoonga\" - and she looks through the crack in the door and there's me on the bed banging up and down and she thinks, \"No! No ! Surely not! Wanking on our daughter's bed? I'll have to shoot him!\" And then - she says this by her own admission - she thought, \"Oh, thank God, he's only having an epileptic fit!\" [He recounts all this with roars of laughter.] So she called the ambulance boys and they came in and smacked her because she had her finger in my mouth trying to stop me biting my tongue - mustn't do that, because these people are strong ! 'So, next time it happened, I knew what was coming. I was at Gatwick airport, flying out to Canada to do Kevin of the North earlier this year. I shouldn't be telling you this, really, but I will. I was by the bookstall, and I couldn't tell the difference between colour and sound.

I got it out somehow, and then I collapsed.' Anyway, he says, 'It turned out fab,' because the film company paid for Barbara to accompany him to Canada and she brought Bonnie, the youngest, and they all had a good time. But, obviously, epilepsy remains an ever-present worry. He will have a three-year check-up next Easter, and perhaps slowly come off the Phenytoin, but he would rather stay on the pills and not drink than risk another fit. 'I mean, yeah, it's a bit of a complete fucking nightmare drag not to have a pint, but I have found a way of taking great pleasure in it. I have never woken up with a hangover, which is great. I am cleverer, fitter, healthier. I have more coherent time. I'm very very happy now. There's also something - whether it was my parents, or my school, or my friends - that has taught me, or bred me, to be optimistic. And combative. So that when something shitty happens, the very fact of dealing with it is good for you.' Suddenly he breaks off irritably, and says, almost to himself, 'I'm constantly talking about this - yayayaya.

There was one messy period when he was having an affair with Barbara Robbin, a make-up artist, while still living with his first partner, Lise Mayer, and they both got pregnant at the same time. He ditched Lise, married Barbara, and Lise lost her baby. But Lise eventually forgave him and he is obviously deeply happy with 'my Barb'. So, yes - a charmed life. But it is quite unusual to go round saying you've had a charmed life - most people who've had one take it for granted. But, he explains: 'I've always tried not to be complacent.

And he suddenly leaps up, worried that he is getting too serious, and starts shouting, 'I am deeply honoured and proud of the fact that Benjy [Ben Elton] and Harry [Enfield] got asked to No 10 Downing Street, and they didn't ask me. Yeah! Yeah! I'm still too fucking dangerous! The only reason they didn't ask me is because I might be baaaaaad !'

And that's your fucking work for the day! But with the audience, it's: \"I think I'll get everyone to think I'm great.\" I like doing what I do, and I don't like being told what to do. But circumstances have forced me to. No ! They haven't! I'm very fierce about my independence.' Oh, I have got the hang of him now - he meant to say circumstances have forced him to do films rather than plays since his accident, but he won't say it because it sounds self-pitying. And also, as he is dutifully aware, he is supposed to be publicising Merlin . As if on cue, the PR interrupts to say the photo-grapher has arrived. I try to delay my farewell by asking for a glass of water, and Rik says 'Yes, me too, but I'll have slightly more than Lynn. Because I am famous .' As soon as the PR has gone, he starts raving again about having an audience - 'It's so sensual. You can feel what might make them sad, or excited, or scared - you sense them, you find out what they're like. It's intercourse! Because I give them what they want and they give it back to me.' And then the PR comes back and he switches smoothly to talking about Merlin and then it is time for me to go - just when I was beginning to delude myself that I understood him. \u0095 Merlin, The Return opens on 22 December.",

      "byline": "Robert McCrum",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>John Le Carr\u00e9 was born in 1931. His third novel, The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, secured him an international reputation, which was consolidated by the acclaim for his trilogy Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley's People. The Constant Gardener is his eighteenth novel.</p> <p><strong> Observer:</strong> What is The Constant Gardener about? </p> <p> <strong> John Le Carr\u00e9:</strong> At the level that is closest to me it's about somebody making an interior journey and discovering, after a flawed life, some kind of morality. Beyond that it's about the same subject that I've written about right from the beginning, which is man's relationship with the institutions he creates - whether they're intelligence institutions or commercial. Beyond that again, it's about what we now have in place of nations: a corporate ethic subscribed to - to my total frustration - by the present government. The extraordinary belief that at the centre of corporations lies a moral purpose, some humanitarian self-restraint. It's nonsense. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Was there a moment of inspiration for the book? </p> <p> <strong> JLC:</strong> It was cumulative. Since The Honourable Schoolboy I have started paying much more attention to the Third World. I found myself drawn repeatedly to former colonies. Cumulatively I was aware of the level of repression and bullying which was happening in the name of western democracy. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> It's a very polemical book, but it also has two characters - Justin and Tessa Quayle - who are among your most successful. Did you find it hard to marry the political side of the novel with the fictional? </p> <p> <strong> JLC:</strong> Well, I didn't really because the motor is one and the same. The motor is inside Justin after Tessa's death. He takes over her role. He completes her work for her. This story could not have occurred without the moral anger and equally the moral anger could not have been expressed without those circumstances and those characters. My own life has been so messy and zigzag at times that it's actually quite a consolation later in life to discover what I do care about. So I had that in common with Justin. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Can you talk about the title, The Constant Gardener? </p> <p> <strong> JLC:</strong> Well, constant in the sense of true, and in the sense of loyal. Then there was a literary echo with 'the constant nymph'. It was just a surprising word and it was pretty. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> Did you look for this subject or did it come to you? </p> <p> <strong> JLC:</strong> I wanted to do corporate behaviour in the Third World. After the Ken Saro-Wiwa business in Nigeria I thought very seriously of oil. Once I started talking off the record to people in the pharmaceutical industry, and to those few brave people who have tried to unmask its activities, I didn't look back. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Your last novel, Single and Single, was published two years ago. This seems to have been written fast. </p> <p> <strong> JLC: </strong> It was written fast. Once it got going there was very little industrial waste, very little going back, rewriting. I've had perhaps three or four books which seem to have been carried by a surge. The Spy Who Came in From the Cold was one, and so was The Little Drummer Girl. If you get all the bits right at the beginning and you come into the story at the right place and you've got the premise identified with the main characters, then you're up and running. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Justin Quayle, like the main characters in all your books, wrestles with his love for the state and his duty to himself and his conscience. Do you think betrayal is your essential theme? </p> <p> <strong> JLC: </strong> Self and state, self and institutions. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Did you always want to be a writer? </p> <p> <strong> JLC: </strong> Yes, I really think I did. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Can you remember a point when you said to yourself, this is what I want to do? </p> <p> <strong> JLC: </strong> Yeah, at Sherborne. I won the poetry prize with a perfectly ghastly poem which I've tried to destroy all copies of. And then, when I went into the secret world I shared a room with a writer called John Bingham, the Lord Clanmorris. John, by example, really encouraged me. He wrote whenever he had a spare moment, and it seemed a wonderful thing to have a book running as a kind of subtext in your life. When I began writing, I thought it would be a sort of antidote to the routine of a civil service existence. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Up to that point you'd imagined yourself being a lifelong civil servant? </p> <p> <strong> JLC: </strong> Yes. I think they imagined it too. I suffered some kind of almost hallucinatory sense of story when I went to Berlin and saw the Wall beginning to go up. And I wrote The Spy Who Came in From the Cold in about five or six weeks. Sometimes, as with this book, I could go for 14, 15 hours at a shot. I wrote great chunks and didn't alter much. It was the same feeling that I'd got it right, I'd got the characters, it just seemed wonderfully easy. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Who are the writers you read as a boy, and who do you admire? </p> <p> <strong> JLC: </strong> I read at the heavier level masses of Bernard Shaw, Galsworthy. And then I loved, still love, our mutual friend PG Wodehouse. Conan Doyle I thought was terrific. I still think that, although he never really brought it off, Somerset Maughan was the most polished narrative stylist of his period. Quite extraordinary. And then of course I read Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene and Orwell. Those were my people up to 16, when I removed myself from Sherborne and chucked it all in favour of German literature. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Obviously a big influence. </p> <p> <strong> JLC: </strong> It was a very big influence. Stories of the education of one man, which this is, and Heinrich H\u00f6lderlin and the Nibelungenlied. They always carried the same moral search. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Graham Greene described childhood as 'a writer's bank balance'. Do you think that's true of you? </p> <p> <strong> JLC: </strong> In that sense I was born a millionaire. I mean it just was extraordinary. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> In the past the women in your books have been untrustworthy and faithless, but Tessa, a marvellous character, is unswerving. Is this a turning point ? </p> <p> <strong> JLC: </strong> It is a sort of change in me. Going back to childhood, I had no example of a mother, because she disappeared and we were nomadic. So I never sustained relationships with women of any age, let alone girlfriends. For years I had a very, very untidy love life. Latterly it's come all right. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> You've always written thrillers or novels of adventure. Why is this? In The Constant Gardener you write: 'If you can't deal with reality then dream up a conspiracy.' Is that a clue? </p> <p> <strong> JLC: </strong> We were born into a great tension, my brother and I, in that our life was pretence. We were projecting ourselves as nice middle-class, short-back-and-sides young men. We learned quite quickly that our dad was a con man, that life was extremely dangerous. That tension never left me. I'm sure that if I wrote the most passive-seeming suburban novel, I would still be looking for a bunched, tense, perilous arrangement of events at the end of it. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Do you miss Smiley? </p> <p> <strong> JLC: </strong> No, I don't. I think I've done him. Alec [Guinness] cured me of him. I couldn't really write him without thinking of Alec and Alec's voice. Also, the older I got the more I wanted to write about young people. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> In America you're treated as a great novelist, over here as a great genre writer. Why? </p> <p> <strong> JLC: </strong> I don't know. I now have a much larger readership in Europe than in the US. And there I seem to get by as somebody who's commented on our own time. In this country, actually to persist with one subject and to work that field as I have done is simply perceived as hack work. The notion that you might be using a microcosm to illustrate a larger context is considered pretentious.</p> <p>On the whole I've avoided the company of my fellow English writers and that world. I think that it threatens me in a number of ways. Envy is always up and running. I've made a lot of money out of writing, I've made a name. But more particularly I fear for myself that I could be drawn towards their standards and their pretensions. I don't read them. I've dipped into McEwan, walked away again, and dipped into a number of highly rated contemporary writers. I feel we're simply not in the same ball park. I don't mean I'm better or worse, I mean we're just doing completely different things. So I just feel completely out of step with the English literary scene. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> Does that trouble you in any way? </p> <p> <strong> JLC: </strong> Not at all. I think I've been so fortunate. With that whole secret world stuff I was a round peg in a round hole. It was a comedy of English manners and attitudes. I was able to write about, as you might say, the period pains of a post-imperial Britain which had had the appalling problem of winning two wars on the trot and had a self-perception that was completely irrelevant to the rest of the world. It goes on and on and on. All those changes that seemed to hang in the air earlier, they simply haven't taken place. The public schools aren't threatened, the Establishment still runs Britain. Go and sit in the Atheneum or any London club, you see the same suits, the same faces, the same furtive little eyes looking at you. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> You're nearly 70.

I hope it is. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> What do you think your place is in English literature? </p> <p> <strong> JLC: </strong> That one, thank heaven, is not my problem.

      "bodyText": "John Le Carr\u00e9 was born in 1931. His third novel, The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, secured him an international reputation, which was consolidated by the acclaim for his trilogy Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley's People. The Constant Gardener is his eighteenth novel. Observer: What is The Constant Gardener about? John Le Carr\u00e9: At the level that is closest to me it's about somebody making an interior journey and discovering, after a flawed life, some kind of morality. Beyond that it's about the same subject that I've written about right from the beginning, which is man's relationship with the institutions he creates - whether they're intelligence institutions or commercial. Beyond that again, it's about what we now have in place of nations: a corporate ethic subscribed to - to my total frustration - by the present government. The extraordinary belief that at the centre of corporations lies a moral purpose, some humanitarian self-restraint. It's nonsense. Obs: Was there a moment of inspiration for the book? JLC: It was cumulative. Since The Honourable Schoolboy I have started paying much more attention to the Third World. I found myself drawn repeatedly to former colonies. Cumulatively I was aware of the level of repression and bullying which was happening in the name of western democracy. Obs: It's a very polemical book, but it also has two characters - Justin and Tessa Quayle - who are among your most successful. Did you find it hard to marry the political side of the novel with the fictional? JLC: Well, I didn't really because the motor is one and the same. The motor is inside Justin after Tessa's death. He takes over her role. He completes her work for her. This story could not have occurred without the moral anger and equally the moral anger could not have been expressed without those circumstances and those characters. My own life has been so messy and zigzag at times that it's actually quite a consolation later in life to discover what I do care about. So I had that in common with Justin. Obs: Can you talk about the title, The Constant Gardener? JLC: Well, constant in the sense of true, and in the sense of loyal. Then there was a literary echo with 'the constant nymph'. It was just a surprising word and it was pretty. Obs: Did you look for this subject or did it come to you? JLC: I wanted to do corporate behaviour in the Third World. After the Ken Saro-Wiwa business in Nigeria I thought very seriously of oil. Once I started talking off the record to people in the pharmaceutical industry, and to those few brave people who have tried to unmask its activities, I didn't look back. Obs: Your last novel, Single and Single, was published two years ago. This seems to have been written fast. JLC: It was written fast. Once it got going there was very little industrial waste, very little going back, rewriting. I've had perhaps three or four books which seem to have been carried by a surge. The Spy Who Came in From the Cold was one, and so was The Little Drummer Girl. If you get all the bits right at the beginning and you come into the story at the right place and you've got the premise identified with the main characters, then you're up and running. Obs: Justin Quayle, like the main characters in all your books, wrestles with his love for the state and his duty to himself and his conscience. Do you think betrayal is your essential theme? JLC: Self and state, self and institutions. Obs: Did you always want to be a writer? JLC: Yes, I really think I did. Obs: Can you remember a point when you said to yourself, this is what I want to do? JLC: Yeah, at Sherborne. I won the poetry prize with a perfectly ghastly poem which I've tried to destroy all copies of. And then, when I went into the secret world I shared a room with a writer called John Bingham, the Lord Clanmorris. John, by example, really encouraged me. He wrote whenever he had a spare moment, and it seemed a wonderful thing to have a book running as a kind of subtext in your life. When I began writing, I thought it would be a sort of antidote to the routine of a civil service existence. Obs: Up to that point you'd imagined yourself being a lifelong civil servant? JLC: Yes. I think they imagined it too. I suffered some kind of almost hallucinatory sense of story when I went to Berlin and saw the Wall beginning to go up. And I wrote The Spy Who Came in From the Cold in about five or six weeks. Sometimes, as with this book, I could go for 14, 15 hours at a shot. I wrote great chunks and didn't alter much. It was the same feeling that I'd got it right, I'd got the characters, it just seemed wonderfully easy. Obs: Who are the writers you read as a boy, and who do you admire? JLC: I read at the heavier level masses of Bernard Shaw, Galsworthy. And then I loved, still love, our mutual friend PG Wodehouse. Conan Doyle I thought was terrific. I still think that, although he never really brought it off, Somerset Maughan was the most polished narrative stylist of his period. Quite extraordinary. And then of course I read Evelyn Waugh and Graham Greene and Orwell. Those were my people up to 16, when I removed myself from Sherborne and chucked it all in favour of German literature. Obs: Obviously a big influence. JLC: It was a very big influence. Stories of the education of one man, which this is, and Heinrich H\u00f6lderlin and the Nibelungenlied. They always carried the same moral search. Obs: Graham Greene described childhood as 'a writer's bank balance'. Do you think that's true of you? JLC: In that sense I was born a millionaire. I mean it just was extraordinary. Obs: In the past the women in your books have been untrustworthy and faithless, but Tessa, a marvellous character, is unswerving. Is this a turning point ? JLC: It is a sort of change in me. Going back to childhood, I had no example of a mother, because she disappeared and we were nomadic.

      "body": "<p>Social affairs columnist. Literary commentator. Make-up guru. Food writer. And now TV cook. If you looked up 'multi-tasking' in the dictionary, the words 'Nigella Lawson' would probably appear alongside. But Lawson thinks this is rot. 'In real life, you can be interested in reading a book and in cooking and in lipstick and in politics - the one doesn't take away from the other.' There is no doubt, though, that it is her cooking that has made her a star; and not simply because her pea and garlic soup (much admired by Nigel Slater, who calls her 'the queen of the frozen pea') sent shares in Birds' Eye rocketing. Just as her recent TV series Nigella Bites drew to a close, a survey named her, with admirable precision, the Third Most Beautiful Woman in the World - pipped to the post by one of the Corrs and Catherine Zeta Jones. </p> <p>Lawson's house in west London is full of people and cooking smells. We have left her husband John Diamond, her tame home economist Hettie Potter and a sizeable group from Vogue (photographer, photographer's assistant, and several people whose job it is to pour olive oil at the appropriate moment) downstairs in the kitchen, monitoring the pizza and cookies for her next food column. Lawson, in a steel-coloured velvet skirt and scarlet cashmere twinset from Anya Hindmarch, with the Maltesers logo embroidered across the bosom in glittery stitches, laughs a hollow laugh when the survey is mentioned.</p> <p>'Yes, but as John said, \"Did they give them multiple choice? Did they give them a list they could chose from?\" It's so absurdly flattering that it's alarming. I could do without that, without thinking: \"Oh Christ, do I really have to put make-up on whenever I go out?\" and, \"Oh my God, what about my eye bags?\" When we went on holiday, the woman who owned the villa we rented said, \"But I was told you were beautiful! It must be the worry.\" So, of course, it's flattering, but I'm neurotic enough to see the negative in anything positive. It's a great Jewish gift.' </p> <p>In her cookbooks, though, Lawson sees the positive in the negative. On page 18 of her most recent book, How to be a Domestic Goddess, there is one extraordinary paragraph accompanying one particular cake. 'One warning: don't do what I did for the picture,' writes Lawson, 'which was to colour the lime-curd filling green. I don't know what got into me but I got out my colour paste and my probe and proved in one characteristically rash act that food is better left to its own devices. I decided we could just about live with the menacing green: things do go wrong in cooking and, generally, you can live with them.'</p> <p>She is right on two fronts. One: the cake does look fairly unappetising - the sort of thing Morticia Addams might have whipped up. And two: yes, we can live with it. Its presence alongside more triumphant confections in this luscious cookbook is entirely reassuring. It offers the cheering knowledge that cookery writers have off days, too ('Well, I try and be honest'), and that kitchen disasters, in any case, tend to taste better than they look. Like the 50s housewives in their heart-shaped pinnies, standing smilingly by their stoves on the endpapers, it trumpets Lawson's ironic intentions. </p> <p>Not all critics saw it like that on publication, which meant that a cookbook - a book about baking! - was suddenly reinvented as controversial political tract, and found itself bouncing around the the leader columns of the national press. Lawson, who emphasises that she finds cooking therapeutic and does it for her own pleasure rather than in an attempt to please others, was surprised when commentators accused her of betraying the sisterhood, 'because in the introduction I say that I have no desire to confine anyone to the kitchen quarters. And when I talk about \"the familial warmth of the kitchen we fondly imagine used to exist\", I think I make it clear that I don't believe it ever did. So the charitable view is to say that the book has been wilfully misunderstood to make good copy, because I think otherwise one is saying that the level of dimness is quite staggering. So, why should I mind that? I have to say, I don't feel terribly exercised by it. What did Liberace say? \"I cried all the way to the bank.\"' The title wasn't meant to be particularly provocative, she says: 'It was meant to be camp. John says I'm a gay man trapped in a woman's body.' </p> <p>At this moment, the pizza interrupts: it is carried into the room with ceremonial reverence, and placed on a coffee table, where it prepares for its close-up. 'Do you think it could do with a bit of a blowtorch, to make the cheese look wetter, or not?' asks Lawson. Everyone thinks not and, as the shutter clicks, Lawson sits back down, absently rubbing her finger over the ghostly presence of a crayon mark (she and Diamond have two children, Cosima and Bruno) that has appeared on the sofa. The pizza is for Vogue's February issue: Christmas came to Lawson's kitchen months ago. Despite this, she is toying with the idea of cooking for 30 people on 25 December. </p> <p>'There are two Christmas traditions I've inherited from my mother,' she says. 'One is the feeling that Christmas isn't complete if you haven't got a ham as well as a turkey. It means that the leftovers are much better. And in a curious way, despite the fact that we're talking about Christmas and ham, it's a very Jewish thing to want to provide a huge spread. I always cook for eight, but make enough to feed 30, so this year, I thought I might as well have enough people to eat it. The other thing is putting ground almonds in the brandy butter, which makes it slightly marzipanish.' </p> <p>She has clear festive memories of her father Nigel (who went on to become the Conservative Chancellor) energetically blending brandy butter 'because it was before machinery'. Her mother, Vanessa, was the heiress to the Lyons Corner House fortune, and an extravagant, instinctive cook who raised her children in the kitchen. 'I can't remember the first thing I cooked, because it wasn't a big deal. We were always making sauces. It might have been a hollandaise.' It wasn't until Lawson was 14, some time before her parents divorced, that she discovered that most people cooked from recipes. As well as Lancashire hotpots and boiled chicken with egg and lemon sauce, Vanessa also cooked comparatively outlandish meals - moussaka, taramasalata, spaghetti with olive oil and garlic - while Lawson and her siblings Dominic (now editor of The Sunday Telegraph), Thomasina and Horatia were growing up during the 60s and 70s. 'Her cooking wasn't really fancy, but I suppose it was considered fancy then because, unlike most food, it was quite Mediterranean.' </p> <p>Lawson, 40, studied modern languages at Oxford, has lived in Florence, and has similar influences. Her alternative Christmas cake is a British spin on an Italian classic. 'The Certosino I came across through Anna del Conte. She's an Italian who came over here at 18, fell in love with an Englishman, and has been here ever since. She has a very good, dry writing style: she's not just a giver of recipes. When I made the Certosino I found it quite dry, but an Egyptian friend loved it: people from the Mediterranean, and Italians in particular, seem to like cakes that are a bit drier than we're used to. So I used Anna's recipe as a base and added a lot more apples. It's quite a good alternative to Christmas cakes that hang around while dust builds up on the icing.</p> <p>While Lawson was a child, Christmas was always spent in London, and a little tense, 'mainly because my mother would overwork and overshop and always burst into tears at some point in the proceedings. And also because my parents made us open our presents after lunch, so of course all you wanted to do was get through lunch and get to the presents. But I always liked the taste of it.' This predilection is genetic. Her great-great-grandmother was such a fan of Christmas dinner that she ate it twice a year: once on 25 December, and once on Midsummer's Day. </p> <p>In Heartburn, Nora Ephron's novel about a cookery writer whose home life suddenly and frighteningly unravels, the heroine explains, 'What I love about cooking is that after a hard day, there is something comforting about the fact that if you melt butter and add flour and then hot stock, it will get thick! It's a sure thing! It's a sure thing where nothing is sure.' These words must have an extra significance for Lawson, whose mother and sister Thomasina both died of cancer, and whose husband, also a journalist, was diagnosed with throat cancer three years ago. Her efforts in the kitchen now go untested by Diamond, who is restricted to a liquid diet. She agrees that part of the satisfaction of cooking comes from exerting control over events. 'But on the other hand, it's about allowing yourself to feel part of the chaos in a safe way, because cooking isn't a precise art. There's a science that dictates what happens to certain ingredients at certain temperatures, but nevertheless you can't have absolute control over the outcome. You have enough control to be interested, but you're allowing yourself to dabble in the chaos, dip your foot into it without feeling there's a risk of drowning in it.' </p> <p>Just as she cleaves to her mother's Christmas traditions, she is keen to instill her own in Cosima and Bruno. 'You do want your children, when they're older, to remember the things that gave shape to Christmas every year. I want to think of them making the Christmas tree decorations. I first made these by adapting a normal biscuit recipe, and then later I thought it would be nicer to make them more gingerbready, more peppery, not least because this would mean that the children would be less likely to eat them off the tree. They don't have to look perfect, and they're very very easy.'</p> <p>Lawson considers herself neither a cook nor an expert. She comes at recipes, she says, from the point of view of a very greedy eater. 'If it's something I don't want to carry on eating once I'm full, then I don't want the recipe. I'm quite ruthless. I have to feel that I want to cook the thing again, and more than once. I need to feel that I have to stop myself from cooking it all the time.' As someone who knows exactly how the media works - Observer readers will be familiar with her social affairs column, and Times readers with her passionate weekly treatise on make-up - she does have serious concerns about her comparatively sudden celebrity. 'I have no desire to be a fashionable person, because that means you go out of fashion. And I'd rather be hanging around for a long time. My son is four: I can't afford to be unemployed in a few years' time. I was frightened that the programme might be constraining, that I'd be turned into just a food person. But in a way it's my job not to let that happen.' </p> <p>Partly for this reason, she hopes to do more broadcasting, balancing the next cookery series against a books programme ('That's the deal'), and has sworn never to commit to a weekly food column because this would take up too much time. Similarly, she's happy to leave certain things to the experts. 'When I get my turkey from Mr Lidgate this year, I'm going to ask him to stuff it. His stuffing is so good that I used his recipe in How To Eat, so he may as well do the work. In fact, I've got a good mind to ask him to make the gravy, as well.' That's why the accusations of 'prissy perfection queen' (her phrase) continue to irritate her. 'I am on such an anti-perfection crusade. I'm not perfect! Who wants to be? I'm not patient at all. I'm not saying everything has to be just right: you will never cook if you think the end result has to be four-star Michelin.'</p> <p>So she gets her stuffing from Mr Lidgate, and she points out that she nicked the idea for her mince pies from Waitrose. 'All the supermarkets do pies with stars on the top now, but mine are better because you cannot really buy a mince pie with such delicate pastry. It's the acid in the orange juice that makes them especially tender. These are teeny-weeny because there's nothing worse than going round to people's houses at Christmas and being left talking, with crumbs all over you, while your mouth is full and your hands are busy with your drink and the other half of the pie.'</p> <p>So these mince pies are a social aid? 'Yes.' After a little pause, Lawson feels obliged to add, 'Well, having said that, I can manage to eat anything, wherever I am.' </p> <p><strong>Christmas cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e</strong></p> <p>I don't need to tell you how beautiful this is: you can see. It's extravagant, certainly, but it's meant to be. And it feels like a treat, breaking through that gilt-tortoiseshell crust to the voluptuous depths of egg-nog-scented cream. The tip of freezing the bowl before pouring in the smooth cream-custard I culled from Simon Hopkinson. Serves 8.</p> <p><strong>600ml double cream</strong><br> <strong>1 tsp orange-flower water</strong><br> <strong>good grating fresh nutmeg</strong><br> <strong>8 large egg yolks</strong><br> <strong>3 tbsp caster sugar</strong><br> <strong>6 tbsp demerara sugar</strong><br> <strong>3-4 sheets edible gold leaf, optional</strong><br> <strong>pie dish approximately 20cm in diameter</strong><br> <strong>chef's blowtorch</strong></p> <p>Put the pie dish in the freezer for 20 minutes and half-fill the sink with cold water. Put the cream, orange-flower water and a brave grating of fresh nutmeg into a saucepan, and bring to boiling point, but do not let boil. Beat the egg yolks and caster sugar together in a bowl, and pour the flavoured cream over, still beating. Rinse and dry the pan and pour the custard mix back in. Cook over a medium heat until the custard thickens: about 10 minutes. You do want this to be good, voluptuous cr\u00e8me, so don't err on the side of runny caution. Remember you've got your sinkful of cold water to plunge the pan into should it really look as if it's about to split.</p> <p>When the cream's thick enough, grate over a little more nutmeg and pour into the chilled pie dish. Leave to cool, then put in the fridge till truly cold. Sprinkle with demerara sugar, spoonful by spoonful, and burn with a blowtorch till you have a blistered carapace. Dab edible gold leaf on to the crust, using a pastry brush or your fingertips.</p> <p><strong>Certosino</strong></p> <p><strong>75g seedless raisins</strong><br> <strong>30ml Marsala</strong><br> <strong>350g plain flour</strong><br> <strong>2 tsp bicarbonate of soda</strong><br> <strong>150g clear honey</strong><br> <strong>150g caster sugar</strong><br> <strong>40g unsalted butter</strong><br> <strong>3 tbsp water</strong><br> <strong>1 tbsp anise or fennel seeds</strong><br> <strong>1 tsp ground cinnamon</strong><br> <strong>375g Cox's apples (2 medium), roughly grated</strong><br> <strong>200g blanched almonds, coarsely chopped</strong><br> <strong>50g pine nuts</strong><br> <strong>75g bitter chocolate, chopped</strong><br> <strong>75g walnuts, chopped</strong><br> <strong>25cm springform cake tin, buttered and lined</strong></p> <p>Suggestions for decorating:</p> <p><strong>4 tbsp apricot jam, to glaze </strong><br> <strong>pecan halves</strong><br> <strong>natural coloured glac\u00e9 cherries</strong><br> <strong>blanched whole almonds</strong><br> <strong>marrons glac\u00e9s</strong><br> <strong>glac\u00e9 fruits</strong></p> <p>Soak the raisins in the Marsala for 20 minutes and, while they're steeping, preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Measure the flour and bicarb out into a large bowl. Heat the honey, sugar, butter and water in a saucepan until the sugar dissolves. Add the anise or fennel seeds and cinnamon, pour this mixture over the bowl of flour and bicarb, and stir to combine. Mix in the other ingredients, not forgetting the soaked raisins and their liquid, then spoon into the tin and cook for 45 minutes to 1 hour. When the cake has cooled, heat the apricot jam in a small pan and paint most but not all of it over the top of the cake to glaze and give a sticky surface to which the fruits and so forth will adhere. Decorate with glac\u00e9 fruits and nuts of your choice, leaving no gaps of cake visible on top. Brush with remaining glaze so all looks shiny.</p> <p><strong>Christmas biscuits</strong></p> <p><strong>300g plain flour</strong><br> <strong>pinch of salt</strong><br> <strong>1 tsp baking powder</strong><br> <strong>1 tsp mixed ground spice</strong><br> <strong>1-2 tsp freshly ground pepper</strong><br> <strong>100g unsalted butter</strong><br> <strong>100g dark muscovado sugar</strong><br> <strong>2 large eggs beaten with 4 tbsp runny honey</strong><br> <strong>set of Christmas cutters</strong><br> <strong>2 baking sheets, lined or non-stick</strong></p> <p>For the icing and trimmings:</p> <p><strong>300g icing sugar, sieved</strong><br> <strong>3 tbsp boiling water</strong><br> <strong>silver balls or sprinkles, florists' ribbon</strong></p> <p>Combine the flour, salt, baking powder, mixed spice and pepper in the processor. With the motor on, add the butter and sugar, then, the eggs and honey, though don't use all of this if the pastry has come together before it's used up. Form two discs and put one, covered in clingfilm, into the fridge. Preheat the oven to 170oC/gas mark 3. Dust a surface with flour, roll out the disc, also floured, to about 5mm, and cut out your decorations. Set aside the residue from this first disc, well covered, while you get on with rolling out the second. When you've got both sets of leftover dough, roll out and cut again until all the dough is used up. Now cut out a hole just below the top of every biscuit (for the ribbon). Put on the baking sheets and cook for 20 minutes: it's hard to see when they're cooked, but you can feel; if the underside is no longer doughy, they're ready. Transfer them to cool on a wire rack. Make up ordinary glac\u00e9 icing by mixing approximately 3 tbsp of boiling water with the icing sugar and stir till you've got a glossy glaze. Ice the cold decorations and scatter sprinkles and sparkles as you like.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Social affairs columnist. Literary commentator. Make-up guru. Food writer. And now TV cook. If you looked up 'multi-tasking' in the dictionary, the words 'Nigella Lawson' would probably appear alongside. But Lawson thinks this is rot. 'In real life, you can be interested in reading a book and in cooking and in lipstick and in politics - the one doesn't take away from the other.' There is no doubt, though, that it is her cooking that has made her a star; and not simply because her pea and garlic soup (much admired by Nigel Slater, who calls her 'the queen of the frozen pea') sent shares in Birds' Eye rocketing. Just as her recent TV series Nigella Bites drew to a close, a survey named her, with admirable precision, the Third Most Beautiful Woman in the World - pipped to the post by one of the Corrs and Catherine Zeta Jones. Lawson's house in west London is full of people and cooking smells. We have left her husband John Diamond, her tame home economist Hettie Potter and a sizeable group from Vogue (photographer, photographer's assistant, and several people whose job it is to pour olive oil at the appropriate moment) downstairs in the kitchen, monitoring the pizza and cookies for her next food column. Lawson, in a steel-coloured velvet skirt and scarlet cashmere twinset from Anya Hindmarch, with the Maltesers logo embroidered across the bosom in glittery stitches, laughs a hollow laugh when the survey is mentioned. 'Yes, but as John said, \"Did they give them multiple choice? Did they give them a list they could chose from?\" It's so absurdly flattering that it's alarming. I could do without that, without thinking: \"Oh Christ, do I really have to put make-up on whenever I go out?\" and, \"Oh my God, what about my eye bags?\" When we went on holiday, the woman who owned the villa we rented said, \"But I was told you were beautiful! It must be the worry.\" So, of course, it's flattering, but I'm neurotic enough to see the negative in anything positive. It's a great Jewish gift.' In her cookbooks, though, Lawson sees the positive in the negative. On page 18 of her most recent book, How to be a Domestic Goddess, there is one extraordinary paragraph accompanying one particular cake. 'One warning: don't do what I did for the picture,' writes Lawson, 'which was to colour the lime-curd filling green. I don't know what got into me but I got out my colour paste and my probe and proved in one characteristically rash act that food is better left to its own devices. I decided we could just about live with the menacing green: things do go wrong in cooking and, generally, you can live with them.' She is right on two fronts. One: the cake does look fairly unappetising - the sort of thing Morticia Addams might have whipped up. And two: yes, we can live with it. Its presence alongside more triumphant confections in this luscious cookbook is entirely reassuring. It offers the cheering knowledge that cookery writers have off days, too ('Well, I try and be honest'), and that kitchen disasters, in any case, tend to taste better than they look. Like the 50s housewives in their heart-shaped pinnies, standing smilingly by their stoves on the endpapers, it trumpets Lawson's ironic intentions. Not all critics saw it like that on publication, which meant that a cookbook - a book about baking! - was suddenly reinvented as controversial political tract, and found itself bouncing around the the leader columns of the national press. Lawson, who emphasises that she finds cooking therapeutic and does it for her own pleasure rather than in an attempt to please others, was surprised when commentators accused her of betraying the sisterhood, 'because in the introduction I say that I have no desire to confine anyone to the kitchen quarters. And when I talk about \"the familial warmth of the kitchen we fondly imagine used to exist\", I think I make it clear that I don't believe it ever did. So the charitable view is to say that the book has been wilfully misunderstood to make good copy, because I think otherwise one is saying that the level of dimness is quite staggering. So, why should I mind that? I have to say, I don't feel terribly exercised by it. What did Liberace say? \"I cried all the way to the bank.\"' The title wasn't meant to be particularly provocative, she says: 'It was meant to be camp. John says I'm a gay man trapped in a woman's body.' At this moment, the pizza interrupts: it is carried into the room with ceremonial reverence, and placed on a coffee table, where it prepares for its close-up. 'Do you think it could do with a bit of a blowtorch, to make the cheese look wetter, or not?' asks Lawson. Everyone thinks not and, as the shutter clicks, Lawson sits back down, absently rubbing her finger over the ghostly presence of a crayon mark (she and Diamond have two children, Cosima and Bruno) that has appeared on the sofa.

For most of us, it is a sensation, no more, a pervasive hint of Islam in the shapes and shadows of the place, in its brilliant colours, its markets, its crooked back-alleys and the sensuous way it moves. For us, as for generations before us, it is just part of its hallucinatory spell. As Charles Dickens suggestively wrote long ago: 'Opium could not build such a city.' </p> <p>In this dazzlingly brilliant work of scholarship, Deborah Howard analyses the magical effect, as it developed between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries, and lingers today: 'Demythologising the enchantment,' she calls it. </p> <p>As a distinguished architectural historian and a Cambridge don, Howard's approach is fastidiously objective. She draws upon a vast range of references, her own knowledge is immense and this sumptuous volume is provided not only with 271 apposite pictures, but with full scholarly paraphernalia. Venice and the East is not an easy book to read, but no serious lover of the city could possibly fail to enjoy and treasure it. </p> <p>Trade and transportation were at the bottom of Venice's oriental ambience. This was a city of trade, with a trading empire, and the search for commerce took its merchants to most parts of the Muslim world - there were Venetian working colonies in Cairo, Damascus, Acre, Aleppo, Baghdad and even, so Howard assures us, in fifteenth-century Amman, then hardly more than a trading post on the fringe of the desert. Such businessmen, and the sailors who conveyed them, brought back to Venice a vast body of knowledge about Islamic society, not least about architecture in the Islamic world. </p> <p>As a result, the styles of the East were gradually, and often symbolically, absorbed. The Pharaohs at Alexandria appeared in twelfth-century mosaics of the Basilica as a reminder that it was from Alexandria that the Venetians had acquired the relics of St Mark, guarantees of their city's sanctity. </p> <p>But it was also apparently the inspiration of the fifteenth-century campanile of San Pietro de Castello which, like a lighthouse itself, first welcomed home seafarers from Egypt; there it proclaimed, as had the original wonder of the world, mastery over the Mediterranean. </p> <p>Sometimes the borrowings were explicit, even technological. When in the thirteenth century Venetian architects raised the great domes of the Basilica above the original shallow Byzantine domes, they not only followed Islamic aesthetics, but Islamic techniques too. And who would have guessed that the Doge's Palace, as rebuilt in the 1340s, bore so frank a resemblance, startlingly illustrated here, to the great ceremonial hall erected in Cairo a few years before by the Mamluk Sultan al-Nasir Mohammed? </p> <p>More insidiously, it seems, the general pattern of Islamic cities was imperceptibly transferred to Venice. The relationship between different branches of society was exhibited here as it was in Muslim capitals - power, religion, business and domesticity clearly defined in the city plan. The souks of Aleppo or Isfahan became the Rialto markets of Venice. The Merceria here was the Cardo of Jerusalem, Cairo's Nile was the Grand Canal. The Venetian fondaco was the Arab khan. Most subtly of all, as the boundless desert could be seen through the walls of those Eastern conurbations, so between the arcades of Venice, over its busy quays, the subject Adriatic always showed. </p> <p>Religion played an ambigious role in the orientalisation of Venice. On the one hand this was an ostentatiously Christian city, but on the other its beliefs were flexible. Had it not been the Venetians of the Fourth Crusade who resolved to attack Christian Byzantium instead of infidel Islam? </p> <p>Later, the Venetians trod a wary path between antagonising the Muslims and doing business with them, and they made handsome profits arranging package tours for European pilgrims to the Muslim-dominated Holy Places (sometimes deliberately delaying sailings, Howard tells us, to make passengers spend more of their money in Venice). </p> <p>This ambivalence, to my mind, still gives a peculiar tang to the feel of the East in Venice. A great Catholic basilica that looks like an eastern caravanserai, churches that look like mosques, a throne of St Peter adorned with Arabic writing, images of the mihrab all over the place, even the ubiquitous balconies that once served, like the Muslim mashrabiya, to enable women to look at the world without entering it - all these phenomena make even twenty-first-century Venice seem a sort of ecumenical chimera. </p> <p>A short review can only nibble ignorantly at the edges of this wonderful work, but although the book seems to me beyond criticism, in a way I am sorry for its author. Scholarship can be a bloodless business, objectivity an arid quality, and in writing it Howard has been unfortunately constrained by her calling. She generally sounds like a don, and finds it necessary to use the unlovely words dear to academe - intertextuality, sacrility, typology, metonymic - besides some rather numbing preferences of her own, like the verb 'to privilege', or the noun 'ekphrasis'. Yet her own beautifully creative photographs ornament this book, and often and again she reads, too, like an artist straining to be free.

Perhaps most fascinating is the contrast between Cort\u00e9s and Montezuma who were the respective honchos on 'the first time in history that two civilisations, which had no previous idea of each other, had met'. Cort\u00e9s 'gambled all and won, but found in victory a strange hollowness'. Montezuma, 'who had been \"on the mat\", as the Aztecs would say, since 1503', was a believer in fate.

At the end of August 1527, Pizarro was reduced to drawing a line in the sand on an island off Ecuador and saying: 'Comrades and friends, on that side lies the part which represents death, hardship, hunger, nakedness and abandonment; this side here represents comfort. Here you return to Panama - to be poor! There you may go on to Peru - to be rich.' Only 13 crossed the line with Pizarro. Within a decade, they had conquered Peru. </p> <p>The book is at its best when interweaving original source material with Wood's travels. It is less good when he is afflicted by backpackery. On page 173, we find Wood 'much as the conquistadors must have done [taking] breakfast of flat bread and olives while Andean kites wheeled overhead'. Within 10 pages, 'we were lifted out by helicopter over mist-shrouded peaks'. Helicopter? How very Incan. This quibble aside, the book is a triumph and far better than the video.</p>",

Probably most societies, at most times, have employed professional weepers at funerals, and never saw anything wrong or odd in it. If weeping at the funerals of adults is a more or less universal practice - only in Bali does it fairly definitely not happen - then other occasions come and go as moments to cry.</p> <p>Plenty of cultures regard it as actively improper to cry at the death of a child. And, in a way, although we no longer regard it as shameful, we probably don't think of it as a particularly elevated activity, in the way that the eighteenth century did. Jackie Kennedy was praised for not shedding tears at the President's funeral; the occasion was too solemn and awful for that. And though there are some who, three years ago, were constantly urging the royal family to blub in public, the attitude which thinks that the Queen should not make a display of emotion at a state occasion prevailed, and remains the predominant opinion. Some thoughts, as Wordsworth said, lie too deep for tears. </p> <p>Whether we are entering on an age, like the fourteenth century or the late-eighteenth century, where girls will wash their father's feet with their tears, remains to be seen. As yet, it is as much a target for ridicule as anything else. Paul Gascoigne became an absurd, Stan Laurel-like figure with his public weeping. No one trusts a politician when he cries: George Bush was a famous blubber, and Bob Dole lost all credibility when he was seen crying at Nixon's funeral. A novelist should think hard before he makes a character cry, and it is a daring film-maker who asks an actress to turn on the tears. As the theatrical adage has it, if you cry and they cry, that's OK; if you don't and they do, that's better; if you do and they don't, that's a disaster. And that is certainly as true for ordinary human relations as it is for anything else. </p> <p>Tom Lutz has written an engaging and entertaining book which can't really be regarded as a history of crying, but rather as a series of curious snippets. It's a bit parochial, so that you are expected to know who Barbara Walters is, but need to be told that London is in England. His examples tend to be taken from American politicians - most readers will find it odd that he doesn't mention the Princess of Wales's funeral, which was such an international public demonstration of a shift in weeping habits. </p> <p>All the same, it is a pleasant jog through a deeply interesting subject - how fascinating to know that American men, incredibly, now weep an average of four times a month. And he agreeably keeps clear of psychobabbling injunctions to weep, and in the end sees the insignificance of weeping.

But the past few days have surprised even her. Only two months after leaving her post, publishers have offered more than half a million pounds for her memoirs in a bidding war that already puts her on a footing with some of the most successful political diarists of recent times - Alan Clark, Margaret Thatcher, Chris Patten and Edward Heath.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Readers of political tea leaves should have seen it coming. Two weeks ago the Daily Mail announced that liberalism had 'destroyed the values that once made this country safe to live in'. Last Friday William Hague - that most assiduous student of Daily Mail sensibilities - proclaimed in almost perfect harmony that the next Tory government would 'take on and defeat a liberal elite'.</p> <p>Cue stupefaction from Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee, pin-up of the liberal Left and the only person named by Hague as a member of this dangerous posse. 'Liberal elite? Moi?' was the plaintive tone of the piece penned by Toynbee for Friday's Guardian. Toynbee insisted: 'It is quite difficult to be an elite of just one.'</p> <p>As Hague prepares to revive his theme in a new pamphlet for the think-tank Politeia this week, is Toynbee really so isolated from the world that influences New Labour? Perhaps she could ask her admirer Gavyn Davies. He has just been appointed deputy chairman of the BBC. The partner of Sue Nye, assistant to Gordon Brown, Davies will no doubt get on roaringly well when he arrives at Broadcasting House next year.</p> <p>He is already acquainted with the BBC's political editor Andrew Marr, a distinguished liberal. Marr, a former columnist on this paper, is husband of New Statesman political editor Jackie Ashley, the daughter of Labour grandee Jack. Davies might also run into Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman, the man who once applied to edit the New Statesman with a covering letter pledging: 'I consider myself a socialist. I believe in disarmament. I favour abolition of the House of Lords.' And, of course, Greg Dyke - appointed BBC director-general by New Labour - is a veteran donor to Labour Party coffers. A sympathetic psychiatrist might understand why the Tories get paranoid.</p> <p>'These people are everywhere that matters,' complains Peter Hitchens, one of the right-wing columnists whom Toynbee, for her part, insists litter the British press. 'It's like a quiet version of anglicanism. Benevolent, mild, not given to wild enthusiasm.'</p> <p>And the views they bring with them are deeply disquieting to souls like Hitchens. Almost all of them quietly espouse the values of multiculturalism, Europeanism, sexual liberalism and equality. No wonder traditionalists shudder.</p> <p>'There are hordes of hangers-on to this government,' says Spectator editor Boris Johnson. 'We're surrounded by hundreds of great liberal Titans. Very few of us are foamingly right-wing nowadays so admission to this group is not difficult.'</p> <p>The Guardian and The Observer are hotbeds of this pervasive liberalism, according to its trackers. A former special adviser to a Cabinet Minister admits: 'If [ Guardian editor] Alan [Rusbridger] calls, you take the call. You might not listen, but he has access, as do many of his colleagues.'</p> <p>The monster feared by Hague lurks in the rest of the media too. Alan Yentob, one of the BBC's most powerful commissioners, is on the list. As are TV producers Waheed Alli, the Big Breakfast founder ennobled by New Labour, and his work partner Charlie Parsons. Just like Yentob, Alli is not white-skinned, causing as much disquiet to his Tory opponents in the House of Lords as the fact that he is openly gay. A senior Tory peer described Alli the other day as 'queer as the ace of spades', a splendid conjunction of the prejudices the liberal elite likes to challenge.</p> <p>The constellation of think-tankers includes the well-connected Matthew Taylor, head of the Institute for Public Policy Research, Rabbi Julia Neuberger at the Kings Fund, and Will Hutton, head of the Industrial Society and an Observer columnist. As they network earnestly - policy lunches are as popular as drinks parties - they draw in single-issue campaigners such as Sheila McKechnie at the Consumers' Association, Stonewall director Angela Mason, and Commission for Racial Equality chief Susie Parsons. All meet Ministers regularly.</p> <p>'These people are bien pensants, but they're not in touch,' claims Nigel Waterson, the Tory frontbencher who first denounced the 'elite' last summer. 'We now spend so much of our time discussing things that these metropolitan types are concerned with. They don't understand the true concerns of people around the country.'</p> <p>Waterson might also be miffed at how many of his former colleagues now mix with the liberals. Chris Patten turns up at parties. Had you visited Daily Express editor Rosie Boycott's Notting Hill home the other evening you would have seen, chatting to the Independent's Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, John Stevens, ex-Tory MEP and pin-up of his former party's Europhile rump.</p> <p>As disconcerting to the Tories as their own turncoats are the horde of businessmen - and some women - who front worthy government initiatives. Lord (Dennis) Stevenson is chairman of Pearson. He is helping to select people's peers. Derek Higgs, former \u00a3600,000-a-year boss of Prudential, is 'on side'. Even Kate Barker, chief economist at the CBI, is described by a Labour figurehead as 'influential and sympathetic'.</p> <p>At Boycott's home you will also meet Philip Gould, the government's most influential focus groupie, and his publisher wife Gail Rebuck. The multi-millionaire head of Random House, she wields a contact book which networks the worlds of publishing and the arts. And it goes without saying that almost everyone in it is on side.</p> <p>Helena Kennedy, Howard Davis, Bernard Crick, Anna Coote, Maggie Rae, Richard and Ruth Rogers, Julia Cleverdon, Jonathan Porritt, Adair Turner, Jon Snow, Michael Grade, Sue Slipman. The catalogue of sympathisers plugged into the grid is huge.</p> <p>For many, rewards have already come; Andreas Whittam Smith is in charge of the British Board of Film Classification, Gerry Robinson heads the Arts Council. Who's up for a 30-strong list of working Labour peers in the new parliament is the talk of New Labour salons this winter.</p> <p>But why should they be embarrassed? 'Twas ever thus,' says one of the best-known of the elite. 'The fact we have the government we have at present means that inevitably there is a network of people who know one another and mix socially and professionally and pass on their hunches and prejudices and instincts. It's access, and access is power.'</p> <p>'We try and have influence with Ministers,' admits Polly Toynbee diffidently. 'But we gnash our teeth that they don't actually listen.'</p> <p>Peter Hitchens retorts: 'Polly has nothing to worry about. Important people heed what she says. If I turned up at one of these events I'd be treated as if my knuckles were brushing the ground.'</p> <p><b>Are you among the liberal elite? </b></p> <p>Answer this simple questionnaire to place yourself in the pecking order:</p> <p><b> 1 Does columnist Polly Toynbee live in...</b></p> <p><b>a</b>.

      "bodyText": "Readers of political tea leaves should have seen it coming. Two weeks ago the Daily Mail announced that liberalism had 'destroyed the values that once made this country safe to live in'. Last Friday William Hague - that most assiduous student of Daily Mail sensibilities - proclaimed in almost perfect harmony that the next Tory government would 'take on and defeat a liberal elite'. Cue stupefaction from Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee, pin-up of the liberal Left and the only person named by Hague as a member of this dangerous posse. 'Liberal elite? Moi?' was the plaintive tone of the piece penned by Toynbee for Friday's Guardian. Toynbee insisted: 'It is quite difficult to be an elite of just one.' As Hague prepares to revive his theme in a new pamphlet for the think-tank Politeia this week, is Toynbee really so isolated from the world that influences New Labour? Perhaps she could ask her admirer Gavyn Davies. He has just been appointed deputy chairman of the BBC. The partner of Sue Nye, assistant to Gordon Brown, Davies will no doubt get on roaringly well when he arrives at Broadcasting House next year. He is already acquainted with the BBC's political editor Andrew Marr, a distinguished liberal. Marr, a former columnist on this paper, is husband of New Statesman political editor Jackie Ashley, the daughter of Labour grandee Jack. Davies might also run into Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman, the man who once applied to edit the New Statesman with a covering letter pledging: 'I consider myself a socialist. I believe in disarmament. I favour abolition of the House of Lords.' And, of course, Greg Dyke - appointed BBC director-general by New Labour - is a veteran donor to Labour Party coffers. A sympathetic psychiatrist might understand why the Tories get paranoid. 'These people are everywhere that matters,' complains Peter Hitchens, one of the right-wing columnists whom Toynbee, for her part, insists litter the British press. 'It's like a quiet version of anglicanism. Benevolent, mild, not given to wild enthusiasm.' And the views they bring with them are deeply disquieting to souls like Hitchens. Almost all of them quietly espouse the values of multiculturalism, Europeanism, sexual liberalism and equality. No wonder traditionalists shudder. 'There are hordes of hangers-on to this government,' says Spectator editor Boris Johnson. 'We're surrounded by hundreds of great liberal Titans. Very few of us are foamingly right-wing nowadays so admission to this group is not difficult.' The Guardian and The Observer are hotbeds of this pervasive liberalism, according to its trackers. A former special adviser to a Cabinet Minister admits: 'If [ Guardian editor] Alan [Rusbridger] calls, you take the call. You might not listen, but he has access, as do many of his colleagues.' The monster feared by Hague lurks in the rest of the media too. Alan Yentob, one of the BBC's most powerful commissioners, is on the list. As are TV producers Waheed Alli, the Big Breakfast founder ennobled by New Labour, and his work partner Charlie Parsons. Just like Yentob, Alli is not white-skinned, causing as much disquiet to his Tory opponents in the House of Lords as the fact that he is openly gay. A senior Tory peer described Alli the other day as 'queer as the ace of spades', a splendid conjunction of the prejudices the liberal elite likes to challenge. The constellation of think-tankers includes the well-connected Matthew Taylor, head of the Institute for Public Policy Research, Rabbi Julia Neuberger at the Kings Fund, and Will Hutton, head of the Industrial Society and an Observer columnist. As they network earnestly - policy lunches are as popular as drinks parties - they draw in single-issue campaigners such as Sheila McKechnie at the Consumers' Association, Stonewall director Angela Mason, and Commission for Racial Equality chief Susie Parsons. All meet Ministers regularly. 'These people are bien pensants, but they're not in touch,' claims Nigel Waterson, the Tory frontbencher who first denounced the 'elite' last summer. 'We now spend so much of our time discussing things that these metropolitan types are concerned with. They don't understand the true concerns of people around the country.' Waterson might also be miffed at how many of his former colleagues now mix with the liberals. Chris Patten turns up at parties. Had you visited Daily Express editor Rosie Boycott's Notting Hill home the other evening you would have seen, chatting to the Independent's Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, John Stevens, ex-Tory MEP and pin-up of his former party's Europhile rump. As disconcerting to the Tories as their own turncoats are the horde of businessmen - and some women - who front worthy government initiatives. Lord (Dennis) Stevenson is chairman of Pearson. He is helping to select people's peers. Derek Higgs, former \u00a3600,000-a-year boss of Prudential, is 'on side'. Even Kate Barker, chief economist at the CBI, is described by a Labour figurehead as 'influential and sympathetic'. At Boycott's home you will also meet Philip Gould, the government's most influential focus groupie, and his publisher wife Gail Rebuck. The multi-millionaire head of Random House, she wields a contact book which networks the worlds of publishing and the arts. And it goes without saying that almost everyone in it is on side. Helena Kennedy, Howard Davis, Bernard Crick, Anna Coote, Maggie Rae, Richard and Ruth Rogers, Julia Cleverdon, Jonathan Porritt, Adair Turner, Jon Snow, Michael Grade, Sue Slipman. The catalogue of sympathisers plugged into the grid is huge. For many, rewards have already come; Andreas Whittam Smith is in charge of the British Board of Film Classification, Gerry Robinson heads the Arts Council. Who's up for a 30-strong list of working Labour peers in the new parliament is the talk of New Labour salons this winter. But why should they be embarrassed? 'Twas ever thus,' says one of the best-known of the elite. 'The fact we have the government we have at present means that inevitably there is a network of people who know one another and mix socially and professionally and pass on their hunches and prejudices and instincts. It's access, and access is power.' 'We try and have influence with Ministers,' admits Polly Toynbee diffidently. 'But we gnash our teeth that they don't actually listen.' Peter Hitchens retorts: 'Polly has nothing to worry about. Important people heed what she says. If I turned up at one of these events I'd be treated as if my knuckles were brushing the ground.'

      "body": "<p>Fayemi was slumped in the back of the car. She had injected herself with a shot of heroin shortly before we met last week and was just finishing smoking a rock of crack-cocaine to get a fresh high. She had not eaten for two days, but she did not care.</p> <p>Fayemi is 14. She has already seen and done things that no one should ever have to experience. She has wide, dark eyes and childishly translucent skin. But the life she has been forced to lead has aged her, causing wrinkles round her eyes more often found in a much older woman.</p> <p>Six months ago, Fayemi's father sold her to two men who visited their village in Nigeria. She saw the men speak to her father and hand him money, but she had no idea what it was about until she was bundled into a car.</p> <p>When they reached Lagos airport, Fayemi was handed to a woman who already had two other girls trailing behind her. The woman gave the three girls sweets and fizzy drinks - and they were waved through immigration. Fayemi slept throughthe flight: 'I was tired,' she says in halting English. 'My eyes were closed all the time.'</p> <p>At Gatwick, the group was met by two men. Dazed and drained, Fayemi didn't resist when one of them took her away. She had never been out of her village and in this strange and terrifying new world, she had no choice but to stick close to the only adult who seemed to care what happened to her.</p> <p>The man took her to a flat in London. There were five other girls. The oldest was about 18; the youngest, Maria, was just six. 'She came from Nigeria like me,' Fayemi said. 'But the others came from far away. I could not understand their words.'</p> <p>Men came to the flat every day. 'From early, early and then late also. They were smart. They wore suits. They hurt me.' Sometimes Fayemi was taken to their offices and sometimes they came to the flat. She was never left alone and any money she was given by the men who came to have sex with her was immediately taken away.</p> <p>She hated her new life. She protested and the men who ran the brothel gave her some heroin and showed her how to inject it. It was her first introduction to drugs. 'It made it hurt more little,' she said, twisting her matted hair tightly between delicate fingers.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, Fayemi climbed out of the window of the flat and ran away. She now spends between 10pm to 6am every day walking the streets of East London, dressed in the long fake fur coat and pink trousers given to her when she reached England.</p> <p>She wants the cars to stop because she needs the money but every time someone slows down, she is terrified. 'The men said they would kill me if I left. It true.' She started to cry. Tomorrow, she said, she would go further away; a girl she met suggested Nottingham or perhaps Croydon. She's not sure where they are. Someone else suggested somewhere called 'Scomland'.</p> <p>The trafficking of children into Britain for the purposes of sexual slavery was virtually unheard of four years ago. Many organisations refuse to accept that it is happening: 'There's no evidence at all that foreign girls are being bought into this country and set to work as prostitutes,' said Jane Ayres, director of the Praed Street Project in Charing Cross, a highly respected, government-funded body. But an Observer investigation has uncovered incontrovertible evidence that foreign girls as young as 11 are being trafficked to work as prostitutes in flats around London.</p> <p>These girls are not only victims of sexual exploitation, but are here illegally and under the age of consent. Every caution is taken by their pimps to escape detection: the children's services are not advertised, they never work outdoors and, although they sometimes visit punters in their homes or offices, they are accompanied by their jailers from the moment they leave the flat to the minute they return.</p> <p>The Observer has found a small number of children who have escaped their masters working on the streets of South and East London. All are too terrified of authority and of adults to ask for help, believing that whatever terrible treatment they have suffered, the Government and police will do little to help them.</p> <p>These girls eke out lives of terrible danger: unless they can persuade another brothel to take them in - a highly unlikely option, given their illegal age and status in the country - they must walk the streets in a city whose language they cannot speak and whose mores are alien to them.</p> <p>'There are three girls on the block here who are obviously underage and barely speak English,' said Gemma, who has been working as a prostitute since her mother stood her on a street corner at the age of 11. 'We're all at risk but they're in serious danger. They don't understand what they're agreeing to and they don't see the signs that we do: I can see violent men a mile off because I understand the signs. They don't understand anything - they do eventually but it's a hard and nasty learning curve.'</p> <p>The swollen weal left across one of Chanel's high cheekbones had turned her finely boned face into a pathetically lopsided mask. She will be 16 in February. When she was 13, her desperately ill mother sent her to live with her 28-year-old brother in a small African village she refuses to name.</p> <p>Within months, her brother had bought two false passports and two tickets to England. 'I wore different hair and different clothes,' she said, twisting in her seat and shredding the cigarette packet in front of her. Her attention was starting to fail: it had been a couple of hours since she smoked her last rock of crack-cocaine and her friend hasn't returned yet with the fresh supply she was sent to buy.</p> <p>Chanel's brother set up her in a flat in London with other four girls. 'No English girls,' she said. 'There was a Romanian girl with a baby. She was young like me but the men came to look at the baby without any clothes. I don't think they touched it; they just watched.'</p> <p>None of the other girls spoke French and, like Fayemi, Chanel was kept prisoner in the flat. She tried to save money to get home but her brother took everything she earned. The only time she managed to save a few pounds, her brother beat her so badly she was bruised from her lower thigh to her shoulder. He didn't hit her face, though; that came courtesy of a recent customer.</p> <p>Six months ago, she ran away. After drifting around the city in terror, she turned up in Brixton. Her days now start at 11pm with a visit to the crack house on the corner of Brixton Hill and end at around 6am, after the morning rush of businessmen has ended.</p> <p>Her brother, furious to be deprived of his easy income, tracked his sister down and set fire to her flat at a time when she should have been asleep inside. The heat of the fire was so intense that the windows exploded but Chanel had gone out earlier.</p> <p>The fire destroyed her few possessions. And now she is homeless. In the past week she has slept outside in the bitter cold or in the house of punters, one of whom raped her while she was sleeping.</p> <p>'My mother doesn't know where I am. I haven't seen her for two years,' she said. 'It's Christmas soon and I want to go home but I am in too much trouble.' Her brother has successfully instilled a terror of authority: she couldn't even bring herself to tell the police when he tried to burnt her flat to the ground as she slept inside it. 'No police. No,' she insisted, 'I'm scared of them. I'm in big trouble with them.'</p> <p>Traditionally, underage victims of sexual exploitation have circumvented Britain entirely, with routes starting in Africa, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America and ending in Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and Italy.</p> <p>Britain has only entered the picture as a staging post: there is a long history of Irish children breaking their journey in London before going on to Belgium and a more recent trend in Britain being used as a staging post to smuggle Nigerian girls across to Italy, but there has never been any suggestion that the girls were put to work in this country. Detective Inspector Paul Holmes, of Scotland Yard's clubs and vice unit, the only pro-active organisation in the country targeting prostitution, has admitted he is horrified by the result of The Observer 's investigation. 'The problem of girls being trafficked for sexual purposes is a major one but this is worse than anything we have encountered so far,' he said.</p> <p>'This is the first intelligence we have had that we have a problem in relation to young girls rather than girls in their late teens, and we can't even prove that those girls, who are mostly Albanian girls hidden in Soho flats, are underage because they're almost impossible to find and have false ID,' he added.</p> <p>The issue is so new that experts admit it is impossible to know what started the trend. They suggest the strength of sterling, the widening global gap between rich and poor, and point out the fact that even though our ports and airports have tightened up their immigration controls, Eurostar offers an easy route in. Others point to the fact that while under the current law, traffickers risk nothing more than a fine or, at worst, less than two years' imprisonment, drug traffickers risk at least 10 years. Set this against the enormous profit traffickers of women and children are already making - an estimated $7 billion in 1998 - and it seems more pertinent to ask why didn't this happen earlier?</p> <p>Nicola Mullenger, a worker for Mainliners, a drug outreach project funded by Lambeth, South wark and Lewisham councils, compares the trend to the entry of Coca-cola into Eastern Europe after the wall came down in 1989. 'It's completely unexploited territory here,' she said. 'Britain is a gift to them.'</p> <p>Professor David Barrett, the country's leading expert on child prostitution, believes numbers of child victims of trafficking have been increasing at the rate of 15 per cent each year for the last three years. He predicts an explosive rise unless action is taken.</p> <p>'There are probably around 1,600 women trafficked into Britain each year and so to maintain that we're just a staging post when children are concerned is bordering on the foolishly naive. Race and youth both have price premiums in this country just as in any other. You have to imagine the lives some of these girls have been leading: they've lived in gut-wrenching poverty in war-torn countries with not the slightest hope of escape,' Barrett said.</p> <p>'Once their self-esteem has been completely destroyed and they have dulled their response to the abuse of prostitution, life in a rich, western world can offer them some advantages over the family that betrayed them and to whom they can never return now anyway.'</p> <p>Doodle, one of the many dealers in Brixton who sell drugs to the local girls - who will visit him up to 20 times a night, spending their money as they earn it - said: 'I've seen a massive rise in the number of young, foreign girls coming to my flat in the last 18 months. The girls come here after escaping from whatever flat they've been trapped in by the traffickers. They might not like this life at first but after a while they begin to enjoy it. It's a new and fascinating world to them: \u00a310 is \u00a31,000 to them - they think they're in heaven.'</p> <p>DI Holmes believes that now the trafficking has started, it is only a matter of time before the number of child prostitutes outstrips demand. 'Once that happens, there is no reason we will not see extreme levels of violence seen elsewhere in Europe,' he said. 'We think the lack of competition is the only reason the shooting has not started yet.' <br><br><b>Gemma's story</b><br> ''When I was 11, I was walking down the street outside my house in Nottingham when these men passed and said things to me that I didn't understand. When I got home, I asked my mother what they'd meant. I started working the streets soon after that. 'I had my first son when I was 14 but the father was deported to Jamaica; I haven't seen him since. I've got three sons now. They live with my dad in Nottingham. I haven't seen them for two years. 'I love them, I really do, but I don't want them to see me like this. I know they're being looked after where they are and when I sort myself out, I'll be a proper mother to them. I spoke to my dad for the first time in two years yesterday and he said he would pick me up on Monday and take me to stay with him and his new girlfriend in Nottingham, My family's rich: we've got horses. I'm trained as an amateur jockey. When I sort myself out, I could tech show jumping and stuff. In 1996, I got 6 months for blackmailing more than 30 punters. I filmed them having sex with me and then threatened to tell. I asked them for more than \u00a33,000 each. It's a shame it didn't work - I hate punters: they're all bastards.'</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:amelia.hill@observer.co.uk\">amelia.hill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Fayemi was slumped in the back of the car. She had injected herself with a shot of heroin shortly before we met last week and was just finishing smoking a rock of crack-cocaine to get a fresh high. She had not eaten for two days, but she did not care. Fayemi is 14. She has already seen and done things that no one should ever have to experience. She has wide, dark eyes and childishly translucent skin. But the life she has been forced to lead has aged her, causing wrinkles round her eyes more often found in a much older woman. Six months ago, Fayemi's father sold her to two men who visited their village in Nigeria. She saw the men speak to her father and hand him money, but she had no idea what it was about until she was bundled into a car. When they reached Lagos airport, Fayemi was handed to a woman who already had two other girls trailing behind her. The woman gave the three girls sweets and fizzy drinks - and they were waved through immigration. Fayemi slept throughthe flight: 'I was tired,' she says in halting English. 'My eyes were closed all the time.' At Gatwick, the group was met by two men. Dazed and drained, Fayemi didn't resist when one of them took her away. She had never been out of her village and in this strange and terrifying new world, she had no choice but to stick close to the only adult who seemed to care what happened to her. The man took her to a flat in London. There were five other girls. The oldest was about 18; the youngest, Maria, was just six. 'She came from Nigeria like me,' Fayemi said. 'But the others came from far away. I could not understand their words.' Men came to the flat every day. 'From early, early and then late also. They were smart. They wore suits. They hurt me.' Sometimes Fayemi was taken to their offices and sometimes they came to the flat. She was never left alone and any money she was given by the men who came to have sex with her was immediately taken away. She hated her new life. She protested and the men who ran the brothel gave her some heroin and showed her how to inject it. It was her first introduction to drugs. 'It made it hurt more little,' she said, twisting her matted hair tightly between delicate fingers. Two weeks ago, Fayemi climbed out of the window of the flat and ran away. She now spends between 10pm to 6am every day walking the streets of East London, dressed in the long fake fur coat and pink trousers given to her when she reached England. She wants the cars to stop because she needs the money but every time someone slows down, she is terrified. 'The men said they would kill me if I left. It true.' She started to cry. Tomorrow, she said, she would go further away; a girl she met suggested Nottingham or perhaps Croydon. She's not sure where they are. Someone else suggested somewhere called 'Scomland'. The trafficking of children into Britain for the purposes of sexual slavery was virtually unheard of four years ago. Many organisations refuse to accept that it is happening: 'There's no evidence at all that foreign girls are being bought into this country and set to work as prostitutes,' said Jane Ayres, director of the Praed Street Project in Charing Cross, a highly respected, government-funded body. But an Observer investigation has uncovered incontrovertible evidence that foreign girls as young as 11 are being trafficked to work as prostitutes in flats around London. These girls are not only victims of sexual exploitation, but are here illegally and under the age of consent. Every caution is taken by their pimps to escape detection: the children's services are not advertised, they never work outdoors and, although they sometimes visit punters in their homes or offices, they are accompanied by their jailers from the moment they leave the flat to the minute they return. The Observer has found a small number of children who have escaped their masters working on the streets of South and East London. All are too terrified of authority and of adults to ask for help, believing that whatever terrible treatment they have suffered, the Government and police will do little to help them. These girls eke out lives of terrible danger: unless they can persuade another brothel to take them in - a highly unlikely option, given their illegal age and status in the country - they must walk the streets in a city whose language they cannot speak and whose mores are alien to them. 'There are three girls on the block here who are obviously underage and barely speak English,' said Gemma, who has been working as a prostitute since her mother stood her on a street corner at the age of 11. 'We're all at risk but they're in serious danger. They don't understand what they're agreeing to and they don't see the signs that we do: I can see violent men a mile off because I understand the signs. They don't understand anything - they do eventually but it's a hard and nasty learning curve.' The swollen weal left across one of Chanel's high cheekbones had turned her finely boned face into a pathetically lopsided mask. She will be 16 in February. When she was 13, her desperately ill mother sent her to live with her 28-year-old brother in a small African village she refuses to name. Within months, her brother had bought two false passports and two tickets to England. 'I wore different hair and different clothes,' she said, twisting in her seat and shredding the cigarette packet in front of her. Her attention was starting to fail: it had been a couple of hours since she smoked her last rock of crack-cocaine and her friend hasn't returned yet with the fresh supply she was sent to buy. Chanel's brother set up her in a flat in London with other four girls. 'No English girls,' she said. 'There was a Romanian girl with a baby. She was young like me but the men came to look at the baby without any clothes. I don't think they touched it; they just watched.' None of the other girls spoke French and, like Fayemi, Chanel was kept prisoner in the flat. She tried to save money to get home but her brother took everything she earned. The only time she managed to save a few pounds, her brother beat her so badly she was bruised from her lower thigh to her shoulder. He didn't hit her face, though; that came courtesy of a recent customer. Six months ago, she ran away. After drifting around the city in terror, she turned up in Brixton. Her days now start at 11pm with a visit to the crack house on the corner of Brixton Hill and end at around 6am, after the morning rush of businessmen has ended. Her brother, furious to be deprived of his easy income, tracked his sister down and set fire to her flat at a time when she should have been asleep inside. The heat of the fire was so intense that the windows exploded but Chanel had gone out earlier. The fire destroyed her few possessions. And now she is homeless. In the past week she has slept outside in the bitter cold or in the house of punters, one of whom raped her while she was sleeping. 'My mother doesn't know where I am. I haven't seen her for two years,' she said. 'It's Christmas soon and I want to go home but I am in too much trouble.' Her brother has successfully instilled a terror of authority: she couldn't even bring herself to tell the police when he tried to burnt her flat to the ground as she slept inside it. 'No police. No,' she insisted, 'I'm scared of them. I'm in big trouble with them.' Traditionally, underage victims of sexual exploitation have circumvented Britain entirely, with routes starting in Africa, Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America and ending in Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin and Italy. Britain has only entered the picture as a staging post: there is a long history of Irish children breaking their journey in London before going on to Belgium and a more recent trend in Britain being used as a staging post to smuggle Nigerian girls across to Italy, but there has never been any suggestion that the girls were put to work in this country. Detective Inspector Paul Holmes, of Scotland Yard's clubs and vice unit, the only pro-active organisation in the country targeting prostitution, has admitted he is horrified by the result of The Observer 's investigation. 'The problem of girls being trafficked for sexual purposes is a major one but this is worse than anything we have encountered so far,' he said. 'This is the first intelligence we have had that we have a problem in relation to young girls rather than girls in their late teens, and we can't even prove that those girls, who are mostly Albanian girls hidden in Soho flats, are underage because they're almost impossible to find and have false ID,' he added. The issue is so new that experts admit it is impossible to know what started the trend. They suggest the strength of sterling, the widening global gap between rich and poor, and point out the fact that even though our ports and airports have tightened up their immigration controls, Eurostar offers an easy route in. Others point to the fact that while under the current law, traffickers risk nothing more than a fine or, at worst, less than two years' imprisonment, drug traffickers risk at least 10 years. Set this against the enormous profit traffickers of women and children are already making - an estimated $7 billion in 1998 - and it seems more pertinent to ask why didn't this happen earlier? Nicola Mullenger, a worker for Mainliners, a drug outreach project funded by Lambeth, South wark and Lewisham councils, compares the trend to the entry of Coca-cola into Eastern Europe after the wall came down in 1989. 'It's completely unexploited territory here,' she said. 'Britain is a gift to them.' Professor David Barrett, the country's leading expert on child prostitution, believes numbers of child victims of trafficking have been increasing at the rate of 15 per cent each year for the last three years. He predicts an explosive rise unless action is taken. 'There are probably around 1,600 women trafficked into Britain each year and so to maintain that we're just a staging post when children are concerned is bordering on the foolishly naive. Race and youth both have price premiums in this country just as in any other. You have to imagine the lives some of these girls have been leading: they've lived in gut-wrenching poverty in war-torn countries with not the slightest hope of escape,' Barrett said. 'Once their self-esteem has been completely destroyed and they have dulled their response to the abuse of prostitution, life in a rich, western world can offer them some advantages over the family that betrayed them and to whom they can never return now anyway.' Doodle, one of the many dealers in Brixton who sell drugs to the local girls - who will visit him up to 20 times a night, spending their money as they earn it - said: 'I've seen a massive rise in the number of young, foreign girls coming to my flat in the last 18 months. The girls come here after escaping from whatever flat they've been trapped in by the traffickers. They might not like this life at first but after a while they begin to enjoy it. It's a new and fascinating world to them: \u00a310 is \u00a31,000 to them - they think they're in heaven.' DI Holmes believes that now the trafficking has started, it is only a matter of time before the number of child prostitutes outstrips demand. 'Once that happens, there is no reason we will not see extreme levels of violence seen elsewhere in Europe,' he said. 'We think the lack of competition is the only reason the shooting has not started yet.' Gemma's story ''When I was 11, I was walking down the street outside my house in Nottingham when these men passed and said things to me that I didn't understand. When I got home, I asked my mother what they'd meant. I started working the streets soon after that. 'I had my first son when I was 14 but the father was deported to Jamaica; I haven't seen him since. I've got three sons now. They live with my dad in Nottingham. I haven't seen them for two years. 'I love them, I really do, but I don't want them to see me like this. I know they're being looked after where they are and when I sort myself out, I'll be a proper mother to them. I spoke to my dad for the first time in two years yesterday and he said he would pick me up on Monday and take me to stay with him and his new girlfriend in Nottingham, My family's rich: we've got horses. I'm trained as an amateur jockey. When I sort myself out, I could tech show jumping and stuff. In 1996, I got 6 months for blackmailing more than 30 punters. I filmed them having sex with me and then threatened to tell. I asked them for more than \u00a33,000 each. It's a shame it didn't work - I hate punters: they're all bastards.' amelia.hill@observer.co.uk",

In a raft of measures to be announced this week, the Government will say it wants to see more people disqualified for speeding and drinking and driving, harsher sentences for drivers who kill people in car crashes, a special, separate punishment system for people who drive faster than 100mph and community service orders for motorists who habitually break the law. Among the most controversial proposals being considered by the Home Office and the Department of Transport are new police powers to impound cars for 'short, sharp shock' punishment.

'It will mean losing your car as well.' Research has shown that as many as 800,000 people are driving in Britain without a licence or insurance and that nearly all serious accidents are caused by a hard core of 'flyers' - motorists, often young men, who break the driving laws most often. In another radical step, people who have killed or injured pedestrians or passengers because of dangerous driving will be forced to work in hospitals under a new community punishment order. 'People will work in a casualty department for a month, for example,' said a source who has been consulted on the report to be published by the Home Office on Tuesday.

'This is not anti-motorist, it is anti-dangerous motorist,' said a senior government source. 'We want to hit the dangerous motorist, and hit them hard.'

      "body": "<p>It could be a scene from a low-rated disaster movie: the population of a historic and genteel small town go about their Christmas shopping, blissfully unaware of the mayhem advancing in their direction. Occasionally, there are little rumblings of the trouble ahead, nervous whispers hinting at an inevitable fate, before those who voice their concern are dismissed with a complacent smile.</p> <p>Welcome to St Andrews, the ancient university burgh set to be the epicentre of the biggest tabloid frenzy since the death of Diana: the transformation of her eldest son from awkward schoolboy to bona fide public figure. In other words, fair game.</p> <p>Ten months before Prince William arrives to begin his four-year art history degree, the first signs are emerging of the extent to which St Andrews will be subjected to the relentless, unforgiving glare of global press attention. Locals report that the two biggest tabloids, the Sun and the Mirror, have already bought houses in the Fife town, opening manoeuvres in what is certain to be a ruthless game to secure the ultimate William stories.</p> <p>The stakes were raised again last week with the wall-to-wall publication of pictures of the prince enjoying his gap year on an Operation Raleigh project in Chile. Cleaning toilets in his Marigolds, play-wrestling with local kids, mucking in with his fellow volunteers: every picture was part of the royal family's carefully honed campaign to rescue its out-of-date image by selling William as just an ordinary, modern, fun-loving 18-year-old.</p> <p>The plan of St James's Palace is to protect the prince from the worst ravages of paparazzi attention by releasing just enough footage of him to satisfy the royal-watching public's voracious appetite. Before the Patagonian coverage, there were the Union Jack waistcoat shots from Eton to mark his 18th birthday, and before that, pictures of him aged 17, looking nervous with his father and brother at Highgrove before his driving test.</p> <p>But the strategy carries dangers: with each new photo or interview, the palace risks losing control of William coverage. In the aftermath of Diana's death, the press agreed that the two young princes should be left alone to complete their schooling.</p> <p>Now, as he is deliberately shaped into a sought-after public figure, the tall, dashing, youthful saviour of the monarchy, the media may feel justified in taking the gloves off. And the venue for that showdown will be among the spires and huddled lanes of St Andrews. Last week, however, there was little evidence that this realisation has dawned on the town.

      "bodyText": "It could be a scene from a low-rated disaster movie: the population of a historic and genteel small town go about their Christmas shopping, blissfully unaware of the mayhem advancing in their direction. Occasionally, there are little rumblings of the trouble ahead, nervous whispers hinting at an inevitable fate, before those who voice their concern are dismissed with a complacent smile. Welcome to St Andrews, the ancient university burgh set to be the epicentre of the biggest tabloid frenzy since the death of Diana: the transformation of her eldest son from awkward schoolboy to bona fide public figure. In other words, fair game. Ten months before Prince William arrives to begin his four-year art history degree, the first signs are emerging of the extent to which St Andrews will be subjected to the relentless, unforgiving glare of global press attention. Locals report that the two biggest tabloids, the Sun and the Mirror, have already bought houses in the Fife town, opening manoeuvres in what is certain to be a ruthless game to secure the ultimate William stories. The stakes were raised again last week with the wall-to-wall publication of pictures of the prince enjoying his gap year on an Operation Raleigh project in Chile. Cleaning toilets in his Marigolds, play-wrestling with local kids, mucking in with his fellow volunteers: every picture was part of the royal family's carefully honed campaign to rescue its out-of-date image by selling William as just an ordinary, modern, fun-loving 18-year-old. The plan of St James's Palace is to protect the prince from the worst ravages of paparazzi attention by releasing just enough footage of him to satisfy the royal-watching public's voracious appetite. Before the Patagonian coverage, there were the Union Jack waistcoat shots from Eton to mark his 18th birthday, and before that, pictures of him aged 17, looking nervous with his father and brother at Highgrove before his driving test. But the strategy carries dangers: with each new photo or interview, the palace risks losing control of William coverage. In the aftermath of Diana's death, the press agreed that the two young princes should be left alone to complete their schooling. Now, as he is deliberately shaped into a sought-after public figure, the tall, dashing, youthful saviour of the monarchy, the media may feel justified in taking the gloves off. And the venue for that showdown will be among the spires and huddled lanes of St Andrews. Last week, however, there was little evidence that this realisation has dawned on the town. Under a winter sun that did nothing to ease the chill off the North Sea, locals were more bored than concerned by the royal arrival. 'We're sick of hearing about him,' complained one man. 'He'll either fit in or he won't. Whichever way, we'll not be bothering him if he doesn't bother us.' His wife was more sympathetic. 'I'm sure everybody will respect his privacy. It'll be strange at first but I'm sure it'll all calm down quickly enough.' From the university's hierarchy to first-year students, from councillors to local pensioners, St Andrews, both town and gown, is happily convinced that William will be 'just another student'. The only clue to the contrary is the understandable reluctance of estate agents to discuss the clients behind the upsurge in demand for property that has coincided with the announcement of the prince's university choice. 'I don't think we would have anything to say on that at all. Sorry,' said the polite woman from Murray Donald and Caithness before putting down the phone. The tone is being set by the university itself. Professor Colin Vincent, the vice-chancellor, told the General Council it was 'important for the whole university, students, academic staff, domestic and other workers alike, to recognise that we must protect this member of our community and never seek to exploit his, or indeed any other, student's presence in our midst'. The university's official response to media inquiries is well-meaning.

We are watching the best argued and most politically serious economic and financial challenge to Treasury-made rules governing public investment mounted in the last generation. You don't have to live in London to care that Livingstone pulls off at least a good compromise and, who knows, maybe even a victory over the proposed PPP for the Tube. This is the breach that could benefit every citizen in Britain.</p> <p>Last week produced two milestones. Bob Kiley, the tough 60-something New York businessmen who masterminded the turn-round of the New York and Boston undergrounds and who has been hired by Livingstone as London's Commissioner for Transport, launched his own \u00a310 billion plan to rehabilitate the Tube's infrastructure. Essentially, he wants to scrap the PPP and modernise the Underground using the same model he developed in the United States. His team at Transport for London (TfL) would be in the driving seat to direct what would otherwise be a hopelessly uncoordinated investment programme, and he would top up the promise of a long-term Government grant and the Tube's own revenues to finance the investment with two simple new ideas.</p> <p>He would borrow money directly from the London stock market by earmarking a flow of revenue to repay the cash. And he would cut deals with private contractors to modernise the Underground; they would put up 10 per cent of the total cost which they would get back only by meeting performance targets. It is simple, practical and unideological - and we know from the experience of New York and Boston that it works.</p> <p>Milestone two was a report from the National Audit Office, the Government financial watchdog, over whether the PPP will prove to be value for money. The NAO recognises that London Underground has been as thorough as it can be in its approach, but says that the structure of the PPP makes the exercise close to impossible.</p> <p>Here I should declare an interest; the Industrial Society conducted a review of the PPP for Ken Livingstone, and found that the proposed system for assessing whether it offered value for money was seriously biased against the public sector. In addition, many of the hoped-for efficiency gains were highly speculative. We hoped the NAO would build on our recommendations in its own analysis. It has. The result is that if the Government is to go ahead, it has to be very confident of its expectations for PPP over the next 30 years. Given the NAO's doubts and Bob Kiley's scathing criticism, this has now become close to impossible - something Prescott and Blair both acknowledge.</p> <p>The search is on for a compromise, with Prescott now telling Kiley and Livingstone that he will not award any PPP contracts for the time being, giving them eight vital weeks until the end of February to prove their case. But success demands the Treasury gives up two sacred principles. The first is that no public body can be trusted to borrow and invest money on its own account because, by definition, anything done by the public sector is useless. And, second, that the private sector is inevitably more efficient that the public sector.</p> <p>In the past I would have said there wasn't a hope in hell. The Treasury always wins, and the country ends up with second-rate infrastructure or such a hopelessly convoluted scheme for involving the private sector that the alternative is also second-rate. But now the rules are different. London has an independent power base in the Mayor. The public is angry. And Kiley represents something new.</p> <p>Livingstone has dared to do what no left-of-centre British government ever has before; he is paying market rates (\u00a3250,000 a year) to a public official with a proven track record and offering market incentives to secure efficiency gains in the public sector. We don't have to privatise to get better managerial skills; we simply have to adopt similar incentives, but with the advantage that ownership stays in the public sector to serve the public interest.</p> <p>A partial compromise could be the Government offering a long-term grant and Livingstone accepting he must offer PPP-type efficiency gains - but that covers only some of the bones of contention. Where the gap between the two sides seems unbridgeable is over Kiley's insistence that he, rather than private contractors, has to have final control, which means giving him the right to borrow.</p> <p>The Treasury may hope private companies accept more risk; in practice they don't, says Kiley. The situation is 'heads the private sector wins, tails the public sector loses'. If the Underground was automatically profit making, it might be wholly or partially privatisable; but it is not. We have to learn the lessons from rail privatisation.</p> <p>And with the NAO offering its support to Kiley's criticism, the Treasury and Prescott are on weak ground. The only way out is to unscramble the PPP and give managerial control back to Kiley - but then TfL would have to borrow, which today's legal framework only allows it to do with government agreement. And that need for central government agreement makes the financial markets leery about lending to local government bodies since three recent legal cases have revealed to them that where any minor problem is not agreed centrally, then they will have problems in getting their money back. If Kiley is to rebuild London's Underground as he did in New York, those rules must change.</p> <p>That is why this is a national rather than a London issue. The US Congress changed the law for New York, with implications for the rest of the US; the same could happen here. A robust framework would be needed to ensure that where public bodies like TfL borrow and act on their own they do so efficiently and accountably - but this is a debate that has never been had before.</p> <p>Livingstone is forcing upon Britain an argument about the financing of public infrastructure that has till now been held only on Treasury terms with results that are a national disgrace. Nobody can predict how the argument will end or what the result will be; but thank goodness the issues are in the open. We may start to get better - and not before time.</p>",

The Treasury may hope private companies accept more risk; in practice they don't, says Kiley. The situation is 'heads the private sector wins, tails the public sector loses'. If the Underground was automatically profit making, it might be wholly or partially privatisable; but it is not. We have to learn the lessons from rail privatisation. And with the NAO offering its support to Kiley's criticism, the Treasury and Prescott are on weak ground. The only way out is to unscramble the PPP and give managerial control back to Kiley - but then TfL would have to borrow, which today's legal framework only allows it to do with government agreement. And that need for central government agreement makes the financial markets leery about lending to local government bodies since three recent legal cases have revealed to them that where any minor problem is not agreed centrally, then they will have problems in getting their money back. If Kiley is to rebuild London's Underground as he did in New York, those rules must change. That is why this is a national rather than a London issue. The US Congress changed the law for New York, with implications for the rest of the US; the same could happen here. A robust framework would be needed to ensure that where public bodies like TfL borrow and act on their own they do so efficiently and accountably - but this is a debate that has never been had before. Livingstone is forcing upon Britain an argument about the financing of public infrastructure that has till now been held only on Treasury terms with results that are a national disgrace. Nobody can predict how the argument will end or what the result will be; but thank goodness the issues are in the open. We may start to get better - and not before time.",

      "bodyText": "The British government is resisting demands for a public inquiry into the military's undercover intelligence-gathering Force Research Unit, fearing that loyalists could reveal the identity of 'Steak Knife' - the Army's most important agent inside the IRA. Suspects in the murder of Belfast solicitor Pat Finucane have threatened to disclose 'Steak Knife's' identity if they are forced to give evidence to an inquiry into the killing. The Observer has learned that members of the UDA's unit in Belfast's Highfield believe they know who 'Steak Knife' is and are prepared to name him if they are made scapegoats for the FRU's involvement in loyalist killings during the Eighties and Nineties. The SDLP's call for inquiries into the Finucane murder, along with similar investigations into the deaths of Rosemary Nelson and Robert Hamill, are key elements of the party's pre-conditions for taking their seats on the Central Policing Board. But it is understood the Government is concerned that a public probe into the FRU and RUC Special Branch's relationship with the UDA in north and west Belfast will lead to the outing of key informants. Officially, the Government says it is reluctant to grant the SDLP demand because all three cases are the subject of criminal investigations. However, an inquiry into the 1989 murder of Finucane would reveal the extent of the FRU's wider relationship with the UDA in the Greater Shankill area and their role in passing on army intelligence files of republican suspects to loyalist killers. This would inevitably lead to the events surrounding the killing two years earlier of Francisco Notarantonio, a Catholic pensioner shot dead in his Ballymurphy home by UDA assassins. FRU undercover soldiers asked their agent working inside the UDA, Brian Nelson, to dissuade his loyalist comrades from killing an IRA man whom they had been targeting for several months. Nelson was the UDA's so-called intelligence officer, whose job it was to glean information on republican activists. Instead, the FRU passed on the details of Notarantonio, who was murdered instead of the original target. The FRU wanted to keep their agent, working in the highest echelons of the IRA's Belfast Brigade, alive and were prepared to sacrifice ordinary nationalists. A senior loyalist commander told The Observer that the UDA in Highfield had been spying on 'Steak Knife' for several weeks, using a flat to watch their target at his home across the peaceline. 'The feeling among the UDA is that if their men are sent down for killings that took place before the Good Friday Agreement, if the Government is willing to sacrifice them, then they will tell all about their relationship with the FRU. And that includes the whole \"Steak Knife\" episode,' he said. The SDLP's spokesman on policing, Alex Attwood, said there was a need for the events connected to the Finucane murder and the role of the FRU to be brought into the public domain. 'The very fact that such activities went on requires that we have these public inquiries. Events like the murder of Finucane, Rosemary Nelson and Hamill, will cast a shadow over the future unless we can throw light on these matters now.' But the Democratic Unionist Party claimed the SDLP was 'electioneering' rather than seeking justice in its demands for further Bloody Sunday-style inquiries. Gregory Campbell, the DUP's security spokesman, said: 'This is more about being more radical and green than Sinn Fein in the run-up to the general election. Every time I hear nationalists asking for more and more inquiries into this incident I remember John Hume's words about us all \"drawing a line under the past\".

The stories come only days after four international human rights workers were executed by a group linked to the Indonesian military.

Human rights groups, including Amnesty International, have called for the arrest and prosecution of those responsible for the killings which follow the murder of three workers for the UN's human rights agency UNHCR in the same area in September. Human Rights Watch said: 'The Indonesia government is allowing its security forces to target humanitarian workers in Aceh, just as it allowed militias to target such workers in West Timor.' Meanwhile, Indonesia has sent more than 2,000 troops to Aceh ahead of a visit by President Abdurrahman Wahid. A military spokesman said the soldiers would be on standby to provide security during Wahid's visit in the light of worsening security conditions and assassination threats against the president. But he said the troops would focus on rebuilding homes and public facilities destroyed by floods and landslides. Wahid is scheduled to visit Aceh on Tuesday, when he will declare a form of Islamic, or Sharia, law and hand over a $10 million aid package to the province. Last Thursday, the Free Aceh Movement warned that it had intelligence of what it called a hardline military plot to kill the president during his trip.",

      "body": "<p>Andrew Brierley will spend a lonely Christmas this year - on a boat in the Antarctic with a robot submarine, several million tiny shrimps and little else for company. </p> <p>His festive sacrifice should pay dividends, however, for the biologist has embarked on a mission aimed at determining the fate of sea life in the Southern hemisphere. </p> <p>'What happens under the ice is of fantastic importance to the oceans' food chain - and as the world heats up, it is becoming clear there could be profound and damaging consequences,' Dr Brierley told The Observer before he left for the Falklands last week. </p> <p>The purpose of Brierley's mission is simple: to use Britain's \u00a35 million revolutionary robot submarine, Autosub - the most advanced underwater probe ever built - to study krill, the hub of the southern ocean's food chain. </p> <p>Krill are small, shrimp-like creatures that graze the underside of sea ice. 'They are crucial to all wildlife in the southern oceans,' said Brierley, of the British Antarctic Survey. 'Krill eat a form of algae called phytoplankton, and in turn are eaten by everything else - fish, seals, polar bears. If krill die out, so would all these creatures.' </p> <p>Researchers have recently discovered that krill thrive in climatic extremes. When winters are severe and sea ice is thickest, then the crustaceans do well. In warm, iceless periods, they decline. </p> <p>'We are not sure why this happens,' Brierley said. 'Either the sea ice provides a good surface for phytoplankton to grow on, and so provides krill with lots of food, or it stops predators like penguins and seals from getting at them. </p> <p>'It is crucial that we find out exactly what is going on, however - for if global warming continues, and sea-ice shrinks as we expect, then the world's krill could die out, taking out all creatures that feed on them.' </p> <p>Unfortunately the everyday life of the krill has been a closed book for scientists. The vibrations of their icebreakers and their stomping on ice floes tend to drive off shoals long before they can get near them. However, such ignorance should disappear with the use of Autosub, the world's first 'intelligent' submarine. </p> <p>Autosub is a torpedo with a brain that can dive to depths of four miles and stay underwater for days while moving at a stately 2mph. Instruments are stored in its nose, while 5,000 alkaline-manganese batteries, enough to provide a kilowatt of power for 100 hours, are kept in its carbon-fibre central hull. </p> <p>Fins automatically direct the craft downwards, counteracting its built-in buoyancy. 'That means that, if the sub stops for any reason, it automatically rises to the surface,' said Glyn Griffiths, head of the ocean technology division at Southampton Oceanography Centre. </p> <p>'Another crucial point is that Autosub runs extremely quietly. We used it to study herring earlier this year and found it could pass right beside shoals without disturbing them. That is helpful when you are investigating marine life.' </p> <p>Thus Autosub - on its first mission to the polar regions - will be able to investigate krill from close quarters.

      "bodyText": "Andrew Brierley will spend a lonely Christmas this year - on a boat in the Antarctic with a robot submarine, several million tiny shrimps and little else for company. His festive sacrifice should pay dividends, however, for the biologist has embarked on a mission aimed at determining the fate of sea life in the Southern hemisphere. 'What happens under the ice is of fantastic importance to the oceans' food chain - and as the world heats up, it is becoming clear there could be profound and damaging consequences,' Dr Brierley told The Observer before he left for the Falklands last week. The purpose of Brierley's mission is simple: to use Britain's \u00a35 million revolutionary robot submarine, Autosub - the most advanced underwater probe ever built - to study krill, the hub of the southern ocean's food chain. Krill are small, shrimp-like creatures that graze the underside of sea ice. 'They are crucial to all wildlife in the southern oceans,' said Brierley, of the British Antarctic Survey. 'Krill eat a form of algae called phytoplankton, and in turn are eaten by everything else - fish, seals, polar bears. If krill die out, so would all these creatures.' Researchers have recently discovered that krill thrive in climatic extremes. When winters are severe and sea ice is thickest, then the crustaceans do well. In warm, iceless periods, they decline. 'We are not sure why this happens,' Brierley said. 'Either the sea ice provides a good surface for phytoplankton to grow on, and so provides krill with lots of food, or it stops predators like penguins and seals from getting at them. 'It is crucial that we find out exactly what is going on, however - for if global warming continues, and sea-ice shrinks as we expect, then the world's krill could die out, taking out all creatures that feed on them.' Unfortunately the everyday life of the krill has been a closed book for scientists. The vibrations of their icebreakers and their stomping on ice floes tend to drive off shoals long before they can get near them. However, such ignorance should disappear with the use of Autosub, the world's first 'intelligent' submarine. Autosub is a torpedo with a brain that can dive to depths of four miles and stay underwater for days while moving at a stately 2mph. Instruments are stored in its nose, while 5,000 alkaline-manganese batteries, enough to provide a kilowatt of power for 100 hours, are kept in its carbon-fibre central hull. Fins automatically direct the craft downwards, counteracting its built-in buoyancy. 'That means that, if the sub stops for any reason, it automatically rises to the surface,' said Glyn Griffiths, head of the ocean technology division at Southampton Oceanography Centre. 'Another crucial point is that Autosub runs extremely quietly. We used it to study herring earlier this year and found it could pass right beside shoals without disturbing them. That is helpful when you are investigating marine life.' Thus Autosub - on its first mission to the polar regions - will be able to investigate krill from close quarters. Brierley, on his surface craft, will be able to monitor how they feed, and how they are eaten by predators - including himself. 'I'll probably have a couple of them as a starter for my Christmas lunch. They're quite tasty. You just put a couple on a plate and microwave them for 20 seconds. It would be a shame to waste them, after all.'

The 38-year-old impressionist whose repertoire also includes impersonating boxers Barry McGuigan and Chris Eubank as well as Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness now wants to break into mainstream British comedy. The comedian along with London based writer Dermot Harrigan are putting the finishing touches to a new video featuring McBlain as Tony Blair, William Hague and the Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson for the British market before the general election. In the darkest days of the Troubles the comedian would spend half the evening entertaining IRA supporters in republican social clubs before crossing into loyalist areas to impersonate the same politicians for hard-line Protestant audiences. 'I remember working on nights when there were massacres and bombs in Belfast. I would go into clubs where some of the killers and their supporters socialised and would have to entertain them by sending up their own leaders and politicians. But I always seemed to get away with it and I never, ever tailored my act for each side. I never had one set for the Prods and another for the Catholics,' he said. McBlain's new slot on Ulster Television's Kelly programme, one of Ireland's most popular weekend talk shows, marks an 18-year journey from one man stand-up to national television. 'I used to get into lots of trouble at school for impersonating the teachers, for mimicking their voices, that's where it started. One teacher called me aside and said I had a talent. So I began recording tapes at home and selling them to my friends,' McBlain said. The result was a series of tapes in the early 1990s known as 'Spittin' Politics' one of which included a notorious episode involving famous Northern Ireland politicians travelling to Spain where they get drunk and discuss anal sex on the beach. The controversial comedian's worst scrape occurred a year ago when, dressed as Gerry Adams, he made a joke about IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands in a north Belfast republican club. 'One guy who was a bit drunk came up to me and threatened to have me run out of Ardoyne. But that's the only real hassle I've had. Since the ceasefires, people are more ready to laugh at their own side and not just the opposition.' McBlain, a Protestant who grew up in the loyalist Newtonards Road area, said he is treated with as much courtesy by republican audiences as unionist ones. One of McBlain earliest and most loyal fans is the Belfast singer and composer Van Morrison. 'I first met Van over years ago on a BBC show when I was doing my Paisley impersonations. Van stopped me on the stairs and said he was a big fan,' McBlain recalled. Since then, McBlain has been on five UK tours with Van Morrison, including a warm-up act at Wembley Arena two years ago. Among his other fans is John de Chastelain, the Canadian general tasked with overseeing the destruction of terrorist arms in Ireland. During a recent function, which took place on the day the IRA announced it had opened a second arms dump to international observers, McBlain dressed up as Adams and marched over to de Chastelain offering him cash to stop inspecting the IRA arsenals. But McBlain has yet to penetrate the national comedy scene in the UK. 'The time is right for me to get away from the parochial subjects like Paisley and Adams and do more national characters like Blair and Hague. So watch out Rory Bremner, McBlain is coming.' Given the success of 'The Paisley Rap', the comic is planning a second CD single sung by the DUP leader's nemesis, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams. 'The AK47 Rap' is due for general release in the new year and includes lyrics like: 'The AK47_ It's like a box of Pringles, once you pop you just can't stop.' And while Paisley refuses to listen to McBlain's rap, the Big Man's son, Ian Paisley Junior is a big fan. 'He said he had all my tapes and CDs but that his dad won't listen to them,' McBlain added.",

      "body": "<p>At 10.30pm the phone rang at Jean Allen's home beside a lake on the outskirts of Greensboro, North Carolina. The call was from the Charter private hospital into which her son Tristan, 16, had been admitted six days earlier.</p> <p>'Tristan got upset and stopped breathing,' said a woman's voice. 'You'd better come to the hospital.'</p> <p>Allen had seen her son, whom she had adopted at 10 months, only that morning, in February 1998. His doctors agreed he could be discharged next day because his treatment for bipolar disorder, or manic depression, seemed to be working.</p> <p>Tristan never came home. When Allen and her husband Richard arrived at the hospital that evening, she told The Observer last week, 'the police were there; the psychiatrist looked at me and said: \"He died\". Just that.'</p> <p>'I found out from the police they'd put a towel around his mouth' - a process called 'restraint', involving five staff. 'The coroner's verdict was \"death by asphyxiation\". I was with him all his life, but not at that last moment. That's when my nightmare began.'</p> <p>Tristan's violent death was revealed to the American public last year by the CBS 60 Minutes programme. Within a month Charter Behavioral Health Systems fell apart in shame. The programme prompted a criminal investigation, yet to conclude.</p> <p>But only now can it be revealed that this squalid story is linked to the height of American power. Among investors in the company which bought, owned and leased the hospitals, pocketing a profit of $114,000, was the man who last week became the US President-elect, George W. Bush.</p> <p>And the businessman at the apex of the corporate pyramid of which Charter was the underpinning was the man who made Bush rich, a market wizard called Richard Rainwater.</p> <p>There is no reason why - or suggestion that - Bush, Rainwater or any senior executives involved knew what was going on inside the hospitals. But the companies that owned the hospitals - Crescent Real Estate and a spin-off called Crescent Operating, set up specially to manage them - lie at the centre of a network defining Bush's career.</p> <p>Crescent was founded and chaired by Rainwater, who with others catapulted Bush into politics and became entwined with his rise, both as donors to his campaigns and beneficiaries from his policies. The failure of deregulation is at the heart of the Charter Behavioral story. And last week health care reforms were endorsed as a priority by Bush and his deputy, Dick Cheney. Their aim is to cut public costs and amplify the role of the private sector.</p> <p>Rainwater and Bush became linked over the purchase of the Texas Rangers baseball team in 1989. Rainwater had resisted the baseball authorities' approaches to buy the flagging team, but changed his mind after meeting Bush, whose father was then President. With a tight-knit handful of investors Rainwater and Bush bought the Rangers.</p> <p>Bush's investment was $600,000, enhanced by special provisions and the building of a new stadium at taxpayers' expense. When he sold his stock in 1998, Bush walked away with $14.9 million. Rainwater, in turn, became a friend of President Bush's family - staying at Camp David and flying in Air Force One - and King Midas to the President's son.</p> <p>Rainwater had always been lured by the fortunes to be made in health care. His first venture had been Columbia hospitals in 1987, later Columbia/HCA after buying the rival Health Corporation of America. The company became America's largest chain of 'for-profit' hospitals.</p> <p>But two employees in Florida, acting under 'whistleblower' legislation, said they had filed false claims for government funds under the Medicare and Medicaid systems. In 1997 the authorities raided a hospital in El Paso, Texas, Bush's turf.</p> <p>Last May, Columbia agreed to pay $745m as a partial settlement. The company, said a spokesman, denies wrongdoing, although two of its mid-ranking executives were convicted last year of conspiring to defraud government health insurance programmes.</p> <p>The year before Bush became Governor of Texas in November 1994, 60 per cent of his personal income of $610,772 came from businesses he invested in with Rainwater, who was among his biggest campaign donors, giving $100,000. That year, Rainwater set up Crescent Real Estate, which became his chief interest. Eight members of the Rangers ownership team invested, including Bush with 4,000 shares.</p> <p>Rainwater was chairman; his deputy was John Goff, another partner in the Rangers purchase and contributor to Bush's campaign with his wife Janet; they gave $200,000. Goff and Janet re-appear with two donations apiece worth $200,000 to the presidential war chest. Indeed, the register of donors to Bush in the early part of 1999 reads like a Rolodex directory of Crescent executives.</p> <p>After he was elected governor, Bush put most of his investments into a blind trust - the Lone Star Trust - in the interests of political propriety.</p> <p>In January 1997, Rainwater's Crescent entered the psychiatric hospital business. Rainwater splashed out $400m to buy 95 psychiatric hospitals from Magellan, the country's largest behavioural health company and owner of the Charter Medical Corporation - America's largest provider of behavioural care. Rainwater already had a 12 per cent stake in Magellan. The deal was a joint venture: Magellan would lease the franchise to Charter, Crescent would lease the properties.</p> <p>A re-christened Charter Behavioral Health Systems would treat the patients and Goff was assigned to be its executive chairman.</p> <p>'The [psychiatric hospital] industry has had its share of black eyes,' Goff acknowledged, 'but we see momentum coming back.' Rainwater set up a new spin-off company, Crescent Operating, to manage the hospitals because of federal law banning real estate companies operating services of this kind. This company stayed in the family: Goff headed it, and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that shareholders in the Crescent parent, such as Bush, would reap automatic dividends from the spin-off company.</p> <p>Despite the blind Lone Star Trust, Bush's relationship with Rainwater, which had dogged the governor's campaign, continued to do so. There were coincidences between Bush's policies and Rainwater's commercial interests. The most eye-catching was Bush's proposal to privatise Texas's mental health hospitals, from which Magellan and Columbia were likely beneficiaries. Magellan was awarded one of two hospitals transferred from the state sector in a pilot scheme, but the plan was scrapped.</p> <p>A Bill allowing cities to levy taxes for sports stadiums resulted in a payment of $10m to Crescent by the Dallas Mavericks basketball team - as revealed by the Houston Chronicle in 1998. The state of Texas sold three office blocks belonging to the teachers' retirement fund to Crescent - the sale of one block alone costing the pension system $44m. The trust fund for the Texas university and public schools system invested $20m in Crescent during Bush's first term as governor. And a school property tax reform of 1997 saved Rainwater $2.5m in taxes.</p> <p>Confronted with these coincidences by the Houston Chronicle and New York Times, both Bush and Rainwater denied operating a system of favours.</p> <p>Later, Charter fell foul of regulatory authorities in Bush's own state, where it had eight hospitals. In 1995 Bush's own administration ordered it to pay $1.5m in settlement of alleged fraud of Medicare payments.</p> <p>By September 1997 the empire had grown by acquisition and Charter came under pressure to cut costs and fill beds. A government report found that at a Charter hospital - Brookside in Nashua, New Hampshire - patients had been subjected to sexual abuse, records falsified and blood was not cleaned from a ward floor. The hospital was later closed.</p> <p>Dr Hisham Hafez, who worked there for 10 years, told The Observer in an interview last week that Charter's regime had become 'so rotten, the system was not a system. They were squeezing the hospital for profit. The atmosphere was toxic; the goal was not to do good work, the goal was to cut costs, to maintain a budget at all costs.</p> <p>'The hospital was being run,' said Hafez, 'by a bunch of very brutal and not very smart people, with doctors cut out of the loop. If you're trusted and expected to take care of people's kids, you cannot run things that way. You can make a living by doing things ethically and professionally; you cannot make a living out of being corrupt - that is Mafia. It's not even a way to do good business. When it collapsed, it was like the old Soviet Union - once it begins to fall, everything falls apart with incredible speed.'</p> <p>There had been other warning signs. In spring 1997 Antonio de Guzman, psychiatrist at Charter's hospital at Pembroke, Massachusetts, was charged with sexually abusing three young patients, and later convicted for what the judge called 'disgusting and repugnant' crimes. That summer, the Department of Health published a report on its investigation into malpractice at Pembroke and in the autumn, police were called to quell a riot on the teenagers' ward. On 1 December James Galligan, a 59-year-old patient, died during a 'restraint'.</p> <p>On that same day came the bombshell. Alerted by the report of Tristan Sovern's death in North Carolina, CBS correspondent Ed Bradley and his team recruited a trained social worker from Philadelphia, Terrance Johnson, to infiltrate Charter Greensboro with a micro-camera in his spectacles.</p> <p>The programme found Tristan to be the third patient to have died within four months in Charter's hospitals. Medical practice does permit such restraints for patients whose behaviour is often difficult to manage. But Johnson's camera recorded a child with a broken wrist shrieking with pain when tethered by his wrists in a 'restraint' exercise similar to that which led to Tristan's death.</p> <p>A girl just admitted is seen being led screaming into a lift; 'Get off me! Let me talk to my Mom!' she yells. 'She had no idea what was happening to her,' explains Johnson. Staff brag to Johnson about their lack of training and the cavalier falsification of records.</p> <p>Krystle Leech was taken for outpatient counselling after writing a note that mentioned suicide. But she was removed to a seclusion room, and her parents told she would have to stay.</p> <p>When they protested, Benny and Sherry Leech say they were were told that if they left with their daughter 'they would call the police', recalled Benny Leech, 'they would come to our house and handcuff her... and she could be sent anywhere in the state... I didn't truthfully know what they could and could not legally do'.</p> <p>Bradley gathered a panel of expert regulators to comment on Johnson's findings. While government officials are appalled, Dr Dennis O'Leary, president of the independent Joint Commission that regulates private hospitals - and whose fiefdom would be expanded by a Bush administration - pleads: 'Our information pathways need to be improved.'</p> <p>Within two days of transmission of the CBS programme, the US government regulatory machine, that Bush now heads but derides, moved in. President Clinton ordered a review of Charter's hospitals, and units were closed in New Hampshire, Virginia, Alaska, California and Georgia.</p> <p>Charter went into free fall: the company sold 53 of its remaining hospitals; the Justice Department joined the regulatory authorities and opened a nationwide criminal investigation still in progress, alleging 'fraud and abuse...and false claims', to quote Magellan's own filing with the government. Magellan said it was co-operating with the investigations; no findings have been made. In February this year, Charter filed for bankruptcy. Crescent Operating took over what was left of the hollow empire.</p> <p>But how much did Bush know about his investment with Crescent? The Observer has opened one eye of the blind trust to question how much Bush knew about where his money was invested. Crescent's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that on 4 April 1997 - three months after Crescent bought into Charter - the Lone Star Trust owned 4,220 shares in Crescent; the documents are available to anyone taking trouble to examine them.</p> <p>A further document at the commission, dated December 1998, shows that the previous 29 January, one year after the Charter purchase, Lone Star Trust sold its shares in Crescent at a profit of $114,000.</p> <p>A reason for the sale was given: Bush was concerned about a conflict of interests involving Crescent's investments in the casino business, to which he was politically opposed. Crescent's gambling ambitions had dogged Bush during his election to the governorship in 1994 and returned to haunt him as Rainwater announced his intention to buy Station Casinos of Las Vegas.</p> <p>There is another twist to the Crescent stock sale: Bush's trust sold this 'blind' stock when shares were at their peak value of $40 each - for a total of $168,800. Shortly after the sale, Crescent's stock plunged to $21 per share.</p> <p>Later in 1998, the Lone Star Trust was liquidated as Bush prepared his bid for the presidency. In November of that year, John Goff resigned from Charter Behavioral's board.</p> <p>Rainwater's office told The Observer 'he really doesn't talk' about his relationship with Bush. A Crescent spokeswoman said it did not 'call the shots' in Charter's hospitals. It did not run them but owned the facilities they leased.</p> <p>She said Goff was now chief executive of Crescent and Crescent Operating. She said they had believed Charter was a very good investment. But the market 'had changed' and it was 'a bad time' for the industry.</p> <p>Joan and Richard Allen, meanwhile, mourn their dead son. 'I've been through despair and rage,' said Mrs Allen. 'I don't care any more about people like Rainwater; if I did I'd go insane.'</p> <p>With money from a legal settlement with Charter, she established a foundation, Tristan's Quest, which helps special-needs children. 'It's what I live for,' she added.</p>",

A Crescent spokeswoman said it did not 'call the shots' in Charter's hospitals. It did not run them but owned the facilities they leased. She said Goff was now chief executive of Crescent and Crescent Operating. She said they had believed Charter was a very good investment. But the market 'had changed' and it was 'a bad time' for the industry. Joan and Richard Allen, meanwhile, mourn their dead son. 'I've been through despair and rage,' said Mrs Allen. 'I don't care any more about people like Rainwater; if I did I'd go insane.' With money from a legal settlement with Charter, she established a foundation, Tristan's Quest, which helps special-needs children. 'It's what I live for,' she added.",

There can be no clearer demonstration where the power will lie these next four White House years: with the supposed first reserve a heart beat from the presidency, Dick Cheney. He will be a Vice-President unique in American history. He will call the shots of detail and decision.</p> <p>In legend, Cheney's titular role is the most despised job in D.C. Ask Dan Quayle or the shade of Spiro Agnew. Who wants to be responsible for boring travel to boring places the President is too busy to go to? Bill Clinton got Ireland, Al Gore got Africa.

They also find something deeply evocative about the few Bush-Cheney joint appearances through the weeks since election day. Bush Jnr sticking rigidly to a simple script and making jokes about his dog: Cheney leaping in whenever a press question threatens to get complicated.</p> <p>A scene from memory lane. Remember how, a quarter of a century ago, Gerald Ford (in a presidential TV debate with Jimmy Carter) informed a giggling world that Poland was not part of the Soviet bloc? Who, in that debacle, had the job of drafting a 'statement of clarification' for the President - then fuming impotently as, after reading it, Ford said he still thought of Warsaw as kind of free?</p> <p>Cheney, Ford's Chief of Staff at 34, is one of America's master minders. Even if George W. was a towering intellect, he would still find the move from the governor's mansion to the White House a bemusing time of trial. Carter, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton all wallowed haplessly through their first year on Pennsylvania Avenue. Cheney is there, at the very least, to steer the notoriously bungaloid-brained Bush through; but it is clear that his influence, in fact, will be greater still.</p> <p>George is not the smart Bush brother - that is Jeb, Governor of Florida - nor is he particu larly experienced in running things. The governorship, in Texan terms, is only the state's fifth most powerful job. Cheney, by contrast, oozes experience. Oval Office insider, six-term congressman, Defence Secretary, big oil businessman, one of Daddy Bush's oldest, most trusted friends.</p> <p>At first sight, George W.'s surprise decision to put him on the presidential ticket last July seemed mere reassurance, recruiting a seasoned pro to a fledgling squad. Now, after a nightmare of an election, it looks both more prescient and more high-risk than that.</p> <p>Experience matters - but, less comfortably, does the vice-presidential bruiser with the right-wing agenda? Cheney, short, owlish, overweight, brought no discernible charisma to the campaign trail. He is an efficient but one-paced speaker. He does not enjoy stump life or the endless days of glad-handing. His own half-stab at a presidential run against Clinton in 1996 collapsed of its own accord. He did not have the ambition for the fight. He prefers the backstairs route.</p> <p>Some voters, moreover, choked on the obscene (by British standards) packages of stock options, pay-offs and compensations that the oil company he ran for five years, Halliburton, showered on its departing chief executive - not just the $20 million cash in hand, but the further $10m or more he continues to hold.</p> <p>Now, however, comes political pay-back. Cheney knows how to construct a White House staff and an administration. Been there and done that, in extremis, for the hapless Ford. Cheney has the contacts and chums. It was he, at Defence, who whisked Colin Powell from a mid-league military rating to become Chief of the General Staffs. Put together the emerging stalwarts of a George W. administration - Powell again, at State, Condoleezza Rice, Andy Card - and they are all names from the Cheney contact book of Republican administrations past, all veterans of Washington beltway life. Old brooms mopping up.</p> <p>But fate - and the Supreme Court - has also handed Cheney another, more testing role. He could, if he had stayed in Congress, have been majority leader. His contacts on the Hill are still good - and if there is one thing friends and foes both say about him, it is that he can be a calm, low-key conciliator. An odd dichotomy. On his record, Cheney is the arch-conservative, with a House voting record - on guns, abortion and all the right-wing gut issues - to make liberals quail. As a congressman, Cheney even voted once to keep Nelson Mandela in prison because he was a 'terrorist'. He was one of the six most rabid Republicans in the House.</p> <p>But close up, edging from one problem to another, he can be pragmatic and humanly unpredictable. (His stentorian views on gay rights in the military or elsewhere, for instance, did not extend to his gay press spokesman at the Pentagon and do not now extend to his openly lesbian daughter, Mary).</p> <p>The personal gap between principle and practice opens every time he confronts actual dilemmas and has to produce actual solutions. Now, apart from the faithful Card, there is no one else around with the grasp or the clout to solve the conundrum of this tenuously legitimate presidency - to put it in place and make it run.</p> <p>Powell will be out of the domestic loop at the State Department. George W., sitting in Austin by the phone, may want to play the homely bipartisan, but he lacks either the contacts or the grasp of detail to be more than a meeter-and-greeter at this stage. Cheney has to do what he is manifestly there for: to run the show.</p> <p>Difficulties? There are plenty of them. Even Bush - who puts himself down in public with a becoming excess of modesty - may find it difficult to live long with the perception that he is a smiling puppet. He is, somewhat testily, already casting himself as a great 'delegator'.</p> <p>The tell-tale alarm in the days after the heart attack could soon turn to dignity affronted if Cheney's profile comes to overshadow the Oval Office. Yet he cannot be pushed aside: he was elected just as much as his boss. More, the office of Vice-President is not designed for taking basic responsibilities, so traditional lines of responsibility are bound to get tangled. Cabinet stars, such as Powell, who had his run-ins with a militarily amateurish Cheney during the Gulf War, could quickly grow restive. Scope for muddle and strife: considerable.</p> <p>Predictably, too, Cheney may find any honeymoon with the media short-lived. Too many journalists remember it was he (learning from Britain's Falklands crisis) who shut the media out of the Panama invasion and then erected a hi-tech wall of silence around the Gulf. Those tactics, and that attitude, will not help him now.

      "bodyText": "The questions linger across America's scorched political terrain: who won the election? Bush or Gore, the Democrats or Republicans? Most important, which will predominate - the peace promised by the President-elect in his speech last week, or the reality of bitterness that has riven the country with his election? Bush's victory speaks for itself: he will have won by a single vote of tomorrow's Electoral College, thanks to a single vote in a divided Supreme Court and 534 out of six million votes cast in Florida with a re-count abandoned by decree only hours from completion. Not a mandate, say the Democrats, for a sweeping programme of reforms to health care and social security, tax cuts for the wealthiest few and international isolationism after eight years of the Clinton presidency. And yet, for the first time since 1954, the Republicans can, on paper, do what they want. 'This is something I've been worked toward for 22 years,' said the party's Chief Whip and emergent powerhouse Tom DeLay. 'I mean, we got it. We have the House, we have the Senate, we have the White House, which means we have the agenda.' DeLay is one of the hard line right-wingers who believe that Bush owes his election to them, one of many in the party, in business and on the Hill, who have waited a long time for this moment, who owe no debt to compromise whatever Bush may have said last Wednesday night, and who plan to prevent any, at all costs. 'The agenda' is indeed a conservative one (the 'compassionate' bit was left behind in the North Carolina primary), and Bush's deputy Dick Cheney has been crystal clear that the new administration will stick to it faithfully whatever olive branches Bush may have proffered last week. Even the much-vaunted overture to Louisiana Democrat Senator John Breaux was one to a staunch Bush supporter and, more important, one of the family as far as the big oil industry is concerned. But not all Republicans are convinced that this is the moment for an all out ideological assault on the Bill Clinton legacy. 'It's clearly better to be in than out,' said Mike Murphy a party consultant who worked with John McCain. 'But there's plenty of difficulty.' Even the House speaker Dennis Hassert counselled that the proposed tax cut of $1.3 trillion (43 per cent of which goes to the top 3 per cent of earners) would be best moderated for presentation to Capitol Hill, especially with the first signs of an economic downturn which may haunt the Bush administration. Even Republican Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, who will chair the new Finance Committee next month, thought it unlikely Congress would pass a tax cut of the magnitude proposed by Bush: 'If there continues to be a downturn in the economy,' he said. 'It might make sense to do something not that big, but across the board.' Grassley's view, however, will not wash with those who believe they put Bush in office and who expect their due and remuneration, be it financial or political. Away from the limelight last week a group of Republicans was formed on Capitol Hill and within the party apparatus with the specific aim of raising funds to keep up the pressure on Bush to adhere to the right-wing agenda. This caucus, which may yet consolidate into a formal group, includes the leaders of the party in Congress who also staged the take over of Capitol Hill in 1994 - DeLay, House leader Dick Armey and Trent Lott in the Senate. Meanwhile, on the other side, anyone who saw Al Gore party the night away with Tom Petty and Jon Bon Jovi last Wednesday would think he had won the election. And as far as the Democrats, half the nation and a formidable array of 280 prominent historians whose signatures underscored a round robin last week are concerned, he did. He won the popular vote and most Americans (especially the Bush campaign and Supreme Court judges) know that had the recount continued in Florida he would also have won that pivotal state and with it tomorrow's Electoral College. Various outstanding lawsuits may yet prove this to be the case and such a result was calculated in a recent study by the Miami Herald . The paper assembled a team of academics and, using scientific methods of polling and demography, worked out that if Florida's 185,000 'under votes' had been counted, even by the most cautious forecasts Gore would have won by 23,000. There is a constituency within the Democrat Party, which believes Gore should and could have won a landslide and is ready to discard him in favour of a new candidate, possibly Hillary Clinton or Dick Gephardt in 2004. 'It's going to be a little difficult for the Vice-President to stay up there in 2004,' said representative Adam Smith. 'A fresh face might serve well, given what a tough battle we've been through.' But for the moment at least, Gore cuts something of a heroic figure and becomes the first European-style Leader of the Opposition in recent American history, a role for which the system does not provide and which Gore will need to carve for himself. House minority Whip David Bonior says that Gore 'helped himself immeasurably in the way he fought the last month-and-a-half' over what Democrats regard as 'a basic issue of justice'. Democrat officials are already talking about a Gore/Hillary ticket in 2004; badges have been produced in Washington saying 'Re-elect Gore in 2004' - emphasis on the re -elect.

On Thursday Microsoft issued its first prof its warning in 10 years.

Interested PC owners downloaded Seti's analysis software from the internet and installed it as a screen saver. When the user wasn't working on the PC, the Seti@home program accepted a proportion of the organisation's workload from the internet and processed the data, passing results back to Seti's main system in California.

Like Seti@home, this is a P2P network. </p> <p>With millions of people using the internet every day, and the wider availability of high-bandwidth connections, many types of device can conceivably work together as a single distributed system.

But the challenges are great, the returns uncertain and overall investment in the sector remains modest - reportedly below $100m. Grid computing requires that special software and intelligent agents be installed on participating devices, allowing it to act as both client and server, and making it capable of initiating and responding to search requests that can swiftly ripple through all other shared devices linked to it. </p> <p>Internet search engines can be notoriously ambivalent when it comes to refined data searches: in most cases, the information retrieved is not real-time and only as good as the last data cache on the web search engine. Activity from start-up companies is now being focused on creating software that can work in and manage transactions on the scale of a P2P network of thousands, if not millions, of PCs. This relies on these PCs being connected to the Grid, sharing their local processors and their 'public' files and directories. As an example, each PC in one school could be connected to the PCs in every school in the country, creating an enormously powerful educational supercomputer in the process. In this way, any information on the network becomes a real-time shared resource. </p> <p>Before the Grid can make even a modest assault on the infrastructure of the Internet, two distinct problems have to be overcome: privacy and bandwidth. With cybercrime now a rampant problem, the internet's more centralised model does at least offer some protection from a direct assault on a PC. However, unless security can be guaranteed, people will be reluctant to adopt an 'open-house' approach to the future of personal computing. </p> <p>With the internet becoming the delivery mechanism for every conceivable form of digital media and entertainment content, bandwidth is constantly playing catch-up with demand. Grid computing over a P2P network of tens of thousands, if not millions of computing devices, all passing data between themselves will demand huge amounts of reliable bandwidth. </p> <p>Just as we were becoming comfortable with one view of technology and the evolution of the internet, another, larger wave of more radical change may be about to wash over society. The Grid's commercial potential still remains unclear and a host of issues need resolving. </p> <p>A universal micro-payment system is also required, so that should a large research company wish to hire the number-crunching power of 10,000 volunteer PCs overnight, a route for the owner to receive a tiny transactional amount in return becomes available. </p> <p>As the network becomes the computer, the principles of the Grid, as expressed by one analyst, Alan Zeichick, may point to a radically different future: 'Millions of participants, no central servers, no search engines, no registration, no index, no database, no identification - and nobody for the lawyers or governments to sue or negotiate with.'</p>",

Just as we were becoming comfortable with one view of technology and the evolution of the internet, another, larger wave of more radical change may be about to wash over society. The Grid's commercial potential still remains unclear and a host of issues need resolving. A universal micro-payment system is also required, so that should a large research company wish to hire the number-crunching power of 10,000 volunteer PCs overnight, a route for the owner to receive a tiny transactional amount in return becomes available. As the network becomes the computer, the principles of the Grid, as expressed by one analyst, Alan Zeichick, may point to a radically different future: 'Millions of participants, no central servers, no search engines, no registration, no index, no database, no identification - and nobody for the lawyers or governments to sue or negotiate with.'",

I'm right on the case, I say. I quickly dial the number by the glow from her cheeks. </p> <p>Ah yes, says the young man at the other end, they're out working on it now.

'They say that if we ring back in about an hour'</p> <p>'Is this party absolutely critical?' she says suddenly reading my mind.</p> <p>'Of course,' I say. 'Frank Skinner might be there.' </p> <p>So off I tramp down to the station, having my first shower of the day courtesy of the torrential rain, and two hours later I am in a pub in South Kensington with Neil discussing his latest expensive haircut (not quite tapered enough, he says), his dodgy football knee (sign of ageing), his unusual decision to bring spare shoes (not fully explained) and his alarm at the number of people who keep telling him he looks like Simon Callow. </p> <p>We go to the party, which is a bright, glittery affair, with blue drinks and sausages on sticks and a long white bar and an ice-sculpted drinks dispenser that allows you to get vodka down your front without even using a glass. Plus, there's a decent spattering of well known people to pester from the world of comedy and I am soon trying out my considerable slurring talents on David Baddiel, who responds to all the salient points of my argument without once looking over my shoulder to see if there's anyone less bulging-eyed and swaying that he might understandably need to speak to very urgently. </p> <p>Spurred by my success, Neil goes sprinting over to fulfil a longstanding personal ambition to ask Harry Hill how he would have his hair if he had any to start with. He returns only partly in triumph, having met someone on the way back who thinks he looks like Simon Callow. Still we have a fine time and at some point I ring my wife to explain why it might be better if I didn't come home tonight, after which everything goes dark again until Neil's wife Delyth comes down at five in the morning to point out that there's no need to lie half naked snoring like a buffalo draped over their sofa in the freezing cold when there's a perfectly good spare room upstairs. </p> <p>I wake some days later to a nice cup of tea, a toothbrush still in the box and, amazingly, some unused Calvin Kleins in my size. There's even a pair of crutches that Delyth brought back as a souvenir from a skiing holiday. Excellent. I wonder if they've got any hot water</p>",

So off I tramp down to the station, having my first shower of the day courtesy of the torrential rain, and two hours later I am in a pub in South Kensington with Neil discussing his latest expensive haircut (not quite tapered enough, he says), his dodgy football knee (sign of ageing), his unusual decision to bring spare shoes (not fully explained) and his alarm at the number of people who keep telling him he looks like Simon Callow. We go to the party, which is a bright, glittery affair, with blue drinks and sausages on sticks and a long white bar and an ice-sculpted drinks dispenser that allows you to get vodka down your front without even using a glass. Plus, there's a decent spattering of well known people to pester from the world of comedy and I am soon trying out my considerable slurring talents on David Baddiel, who responds to all the salient points of my argument without once looking over my shoulder to see if there's anyone less bulging-eyed and swaying that he might understandably need to speak to very urgently. Spurred by my success, Neil goes sprinting over to fulfil a longstanding personal ambition to ask Harry Hill how he would have his hair if he had any to start with. He returns only partly in triumph, having met someone on the way back who thinks he looks like Simon Callow. Still we have a fine time and at some point I ring my wife to explain why it might be better if I didn't come home tonight, after which everything goes dark again until Neil's wife Delyth comes down at five in the morning to point out that there's no need to lie half naked snoring like a buffalo draped over their sofa in the freezing cold when there's a perfectly good spare room upstairs. I wake some days later to a nice cup of tea, a toothbrush still in the box and, amazingly, some unused Calvin Kleins in my size. There's even a pair of crutches that Delyth brought back as a souvenir from a skiing holiday. Excellent. I wonder if they've got any hot water",

'They will all have staffing plans, but if there is a flu virus, thousands more will be called in to deal with the emergency.'",

Like most other countries in Europe, it will experience an increase in life expectancy over the next decade, creating an older, dependent population. This will have a huge direct as well as indirect impact on the economy, a demographic time bomb that will affect both labour and consumer markets. </p> <p>As part of this trend, the fiftysomething age group is expanding. Baby boomers have reached maturity. From 20 per cent of the population today, they will grow to 25 per cent over the next few years. Yet fewer of them are in full-time employment. The proportion for men has fallen from 93 per cent in the Seventies to 75 per cent today, while for women it has remained constant at about 60 per cent. </p> <p>Consider that this is happening in an economy where skills shortages are growing. The number of young people entering the labour market is declining sharply, partly the result of falling birth rates in the Seventies and Eighties. A key issue, then, is whether the economy can continue to accept such a low participation rate among 50-year-olds, which on the face of it suggests a huge underutilisation of talent and skills. </p> <p>The first question to ask is: are the disappearing fifties being pushed out of employment or pulled out by the attractions of life after work? </p> <p>The answer seems to be both. Corporate restructuring continues to be a major 'push' factor. The application of information and communica tion technologies has allowed companies to automate their management processes, rendering obsolete the more rigid hierarchical structures of traditional bureaucracies. This does not mean the end of hierarchical controls - on the contrary. Information technologies allow even stricter monitoring of performance (even if we work from home). But it does not require tiers of managers. Middle managers in their fifties are usually first to be earmarked to go. </p> <p>It is the same with corporate mergers and acquisitions, where the driving motive, particularly in financial services and manufacturing, is cost-cutting through reducing head count. So 50-year-olds are normally first to be offered redundancy. </p> <p>Companies' justification for pushing out their older employees is that these people are in a better position to cope with unemployment. They are seen to have fewer family responsibilities and lower financial demands because mortgages and loans have been repaid. </p> <p>What this assumption fails to recognise, however, is that this is a 'sandwiched' generation. A growing number of its members have greater and more complex financial burdens because of increasing life expectancy and the more turbulent nature of their personal life histories. The former obliges more 50- year-olds to be responsible for ageing parents. But the gender revolution means many women are no longer prepared to look after elderly relatives in 'granny flats'. Paid-for residential care is seen as a better option. At the same time, an increase in divorce means that a growing number of 50-year-old men are having to support children from their first marriage who are now at university plus those from a current relationship who may be still at school. As a result, they may have far greater financial burdens than younger colleagues. </p> <p>But corporate 'push' also operates in a more informal sense. Ageism is rife in British industry - probably more so than in the US, Germany, Japan or Scandinavia. Some of this is built into corporate human resource policies. But it is also evident in more subtle ways. As companies restructure operational processes around teams and project management, the new cultures often reflect the interests of younger employees. Feeling marginalised in these peer groups, older colleagues feel themselves under pressure to quit - a not uncommon experience in high-tech and media industries. </p> <p>But there are also 'pull' factors that encourage some 50-year-olds to quit their jobs. These are largely middle-class professionals who can afford to take voluntary early retirement - in strong contrast to those with insecure, low-paid and manual jobs who have to slog it out until they can draw their state pensions. </p> <p>More privileged managers and professionals, benefiting from lump-sum payments and income from company pension schemes, are the time- and cash-rich spenders that marketers refer to. It remains to be seen whether these pension schemes will be as affordable for companies in the next 10 years as they have been in the past. </p> <p>But while the good times last, the early-retired baby boomers seem to be having the time of their lives. As the hippie generation of 30 years ago, many never really wanted to have full-time jobs anyway. Needing income in a cold climate, they took up careers in the expanding public and private-sector professions of the late Sixties and Seventies. They do not see themselves as 'early retired' but rather as moving into 'life after work' - an opportunity to do all the things which intensive employment and family pressures have prevented them from doing over the previous 20 years. </p> <p>These people have now established a lifestyle role model that government policy will find it difficult to shift. Despite demographic and economic trends that require people to continue working well into their sixties, a culture of early retirement has set in. Performance-related reward systems and project-management principles are re- inforcing this intensity of work, creating stress and a work-life imbalance. Early retirement for affluent 50-year-olds offers the ideal escape route. </p> <p>Scandinavian countries have far higher employment-participation rates among people in their fifties and sixties. Is this because they have far more effective family-friendly employment policies for all sectors of their working populations? Making employment more enjoyable and less stressful would reduce the attractions of early retirement among professionals and the other fiftysomething experts whose skills are in demand. </p> <p>To reduce mid-life executive burnout ought to be part of companies' social responsibility.
