The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that it was considering a number of allegations and would make a decision on whether to pursue the cases after consultation with victims' relatives. Robert Davies, crown prosecutor in Oldham and Hyde, Greater Manchester, said: \"No decision can be taken as to whether it is in the public interest to pursue these allegations further until the views of the families concerned have been sought.\" \"We will reach a decision as soon as possible,\" he added. After Shipman's arrest in August 1998 police found stockpiles of diamorphine which could provide nearly 1,500 lethal injections. Police subsequently investigated around 140 deaths of patients at Shipman's practice and found enough evidence to raise suspicions about Shipman in some 90 of those. South Manchester coroner John Pollard said it was possible to speculate that the death toll could be as high as 1,000, but that the full extent of his crimes could never be known. It was unlikely that the full extent of Shipman's crimes would ever be discovered, Mr Pollard said, both because it was extremely difficult to detect the cause of death in bodies which were buried more than four years before any examination, and as most funerals now took place as cremations. \"He is convicted of 15 murders over three years,\" Mr Pollard said. \"The police investigated about 130 deaths over that time.

Now a test looms, determining whether that was simply battle-rallying rhetoric or the first sketch of a consistent political vision. The test in question is the Dakar conference on education due to be held in Senegal this April. That gathering should prove whether Mr Blair's commitment to global human rights extends to one of the most basic - the right to learn to read and write. </p> <p>In Dakar the international community - three UN organisations and the World Bank - will review their collective failure. In 1990, an international agreement set 2000 as the target date for universal primary education. That time has now arrived and yet 125m children are currently not getting any education. The target date has now been postponed to 2015, but at current projections we have already failed that too. What makes this failure devastating is that education is probably the single most important factor in determining human development - affecting infant mortality, economic growth and population control - yet it is being tragically ill-served by a shaming absence of political commitment and the most ineffective and corrupt UN organisation, Unesco. </p> <p> So here is Mr Blair's opportunity to develop his concept of international community. He can export his domestic preoccupation with education, education, education to the world. Before Christmas, he made a powerful speech explaining how 150 years of political neglect had crippled Britain's education system, and insisting that this had to change if Britain was to prosper. This is just as relevant in Guatemala or Tanzania as it is in England or Scotland. </p> <p>Last week, Clare Short trailed a white paper on how globalisation can improve the lot of the world's poor rather than relegate them to permanent deprivation. The key to that laudable goal could well be April's deliberations in Dacca. But it will need determined political leadership to avoid failure. If Mr Blair took this issue up the way his chancellor championed debt relief, he could make all the difference, generating resources and international motivation. What is needed, Oxfam argues, is $8bn a year for the next decade to get every child into school by 2015. If developing countries contributed half, the rich north would only be increasing their $50bn annual aid bill by a mere $4 billion. Given the potential benefits, it's a small investment. One note of caution: the magic solution cannot be distance-learning on the internet. School children in India, Nepal and Zambia need chalk, blackboards and exercise books; they don't have electricity in their villages, let alone a computer. </p> <p>Hardened political strategists may wonder how this will deliver the votes of Mondeo man and Worcester Woman. But international commitment does pay domestic political dividends, as Gordon Brown learned through his astute advocacy of the debt issue. That won the iron chancellor admirers in all quarters, and especially among the activists of the Labour party. These are the people who remain sceptical of Mr Blair - and who he needs to win over if they are to help him win the next election. A moral lead on universal education would send the clear message that this government is not just about spin and image, but purpose.</p>",

School children in India, Nepal and Zambia need chalk, blackboards and exercise books; they don't have electricity in their villages, let alone a computer. Hardened political strategists may wonder how this will deliver the votes of Mondeo man and Worcester Woman. But international commitment does pay domestic political dividends, as Gordon Brown learned through his astute advocacy of the debt issue. That won the iron chancellor admirers in all quarters, and especially among the activists of the Labour party. These are the people who remain sceptical of Mr Blair - and who he needs to win over if they are to help him win the next election. A moral lead on universal education would send the clear message that this government is not just about spin and image, but purpose.",

It's exhibit AJB22 - that's the folder there - if you want to take the documents out - spread them out - so it's easier to refer to them in the best way you want. I'll just move that out of your way. OK.</p> <p>I want now to produce another exhibit for you to look at, it's a police reference OB24. Hand that to you now. It's the death certificate for Mrs Mellor. Off that certificate will you just confirm for me what you attributed her death to?</p> <p>Shipman: A coronary thrombosis.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Were there any other conditions?</p> <p>Shipman: Listed there? Nothing that was relevant to the cause of death.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Can you tell me, from whatever sources you use, how you came to that conclusion exactly that it was a coronary thrombosis?</p> <p>Shipman: Well the history of angina that's of increasing severity. We have a relatively sudden death. Sudden in the sense that the patient hasn't made the effort to dial 99-9 - three nines, sorry, three nines. Hasn't staggered round to the neighbours and that's often the story with elderly patients that have coronaries fairly rapidly.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Were there any signs on this lady's body which indicated to you that that was the cause of her death?</p> <p>Shipman: There are no signs on the body.</p> <p>Police interviewer: There are no signs?</p> <p>Shipman: No.</p> <p>Police interviewer: So you base this conclusion on the history you had of chest pain and angina?</p> <p>Shipman: Yes.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Is that the sole thing that you based on?</p> <p>Shipman: Yes.</p> <p>Police interviewer: How satisfied did you feel about that decision?</p> <p>Shipman: At the time, very satisfied.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Has that changed now?</p> <p>Shipman: If I'd have had a post-mortem I understand from my solicitor that there was some apharoma [phon.].</p> <p>Police interviewer: Well rather than discuss it with your solicitor ...</p> <p>Shipman: But nothing else.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Can you indicate to me how severe the angina was at all?</p> <p>Shipman: The severity of angina doesn't indicate the likelihood of a coronary. I'm sure your medical experts would agree that. She had no signs of congested heart failure, she only got a pain if she rushed but it was lasting two to three minutes. How does one grade angina? Severe angina - you don't even get out of bed.</p> <p>Police interviewer: From the progression you've noted on your records this was not something that would have been expected.</p> <p>Shipman: This was a progressive angina. And people do die of coronaries with no preceding history of angina.</p> <p>Police interviewer: There's certain facts I need to make you aware of at this stage. I don't think there can be any dispute in a lot of them. Mrs Mellor's body was buried on the 18th May 1998 at Highfield Cemetery, Stockport. Would you accept that from me?</p> <p>Shipman: If you say.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Now would you also accept that the body of Mrs Mellor was exhumed with consent of the Coroner on the 22nd of September this year?</p> <p>Shipman: If you say so.</p> <p>Police interviewer: And I think, from what you were saying earlier, you were aware that a post-mortem examination was subsequently undertaken. Certain samples were taken at that post-mortem for forensic analysis. Would you accept that?</p> <p>Shipman: You're telling the story, yes of course.</p> <p>Police interviewer: A Home Office pathologist - Dr Rutherford - carried out that post-mortem examination. I think as you were going to mention, his findings do not support that this lady died of a coronary thrombosis as you diagnosed. Would you like to make any comment on that - that finding?</p> <p>Shipman: Doctors don't always diagnose a heart attack as a heart attack, they'll call it a coronary thrombosis or myocardial ischaemia or myocardial infarction. To the average run of the mill GP they are all the same - the patient's dead. With a coronary thrombosis you'd expect that there'd be a bit of heart that's sort of damaged but you can have had just an electrical disorganisation of the heart which kills you just as effectively and leaves no symptoms at all - no signs, sorry, signs at all.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Well in his expert opinion there was nothing to support your diagnosis is what I'm saying.</p> <p>Shipman: And he couldn't rule out a disorganised electrical activity in the heart.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Forensic examination of the samples taken, including muscle tissue, at that post-mortem have been examined. These are the samples taken from Mrs Mellor. And there's certainly a high level of morphine still contained in her body - a fatal level to be precise. Can you account for that?</p> <p>Shipman: No.</p> <p>Police interviewer: I'd like to put it to you doctor that you were the person who administered that lady with the drug aren't you?</p> <p>Shipman: No.</p> <p>Police interviewer: The levels were such that this woman actually died from toxicity of morphine, not as you wrongly diagnosed - in plain speaking you murdered her.</p> <p>Shipman: No.</p> <p>Police interviewer: An expert has examined the drug this lady's been prescribed, from the records you looked to earlier within the exhibit - AJB22 - and from those records nothing has been found which could account for the morphine in her body. Can you suggest how it's got there?</p> <p>Shipman: No.</p> <p>Police interviewer: From your records, which you've had access to for some time now, can you point out where the visits you made to Mrs Mellor are indicated on the records?</p> <p>Shipman: Which visits are we talking about?</p> <p>Police interviewer: Well you said there was a visit in the morning.</p> <p>Shipman: No I said that she came to surgery. Says here at his practice.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Can you just show me where that is?</p> <p>Shipman: I thought we'd got this perfectly clear, the 11th of the 11th here.</p> <p>Police interviewer: So that's on page nine and it's the second entry 11.05.98 - angina pectoris. I don't understand what these terms mean here. Perhaps you could explain that for me, is this the right place I'm looking at?</p> <p>Shipman: Yes that's the right place you're looking at. And I read that record out to you on the previous tape and if you wish I'll do it again.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Please.</p> <p>Shipman: Blood pressure's 140 over 80. The heart sounds were normal, no oedema, no sign of heart failure. Pain only if she rushes upstairs in - and it's in the throat and now in the arms. It lasts for possibly two or three minutes, it gets better all the time - meaning when she stays still it goes away. Refuses treatment.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Now you told us you went back to Mrs Mellor's home when you found her dead at roughly quarter past six, I believe it was, where is the record of that please?</p> <p>Shipman: I went back? You know I went, for the first time, to see her dead.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Well now you're saying it's the first time before you said you couldn't remember, which is it?</p> <p>Shipman: Well you're taking it that it's a repeat visit, I'm correcting you in saying I can't remember visiting at 3 o'clock, so for me this is the first visit.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Where's the record of that visit?</p> <p>Shipman: The record is on the front of the record there - 11.05.98 coronary thrombosis cause of death.</p> <p>Police interviewer: And then there was a further visit later on with the family, is there a record of that?</p> <p>Shipman: No.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Would you not normally make a record of that?</p> <p>Shipman: No.</p> <p>Shipman's solicitor: There is, sorry, just to clarify, there's another entry on 11.05.98 Owen [sic.] dead.</p> <p>Shipman: There that's fine: \"Called in to see her 6.15 - dead, coronary thrombosis, daughter Linda present.\" I'm afraid both of us missed that, second entry from the bottom.</p> <p>Police interviewer: So on this case, as well as making a written record on the front of your manila folder you've also got computer entry?</p> <p>Shipman: Yes.</p> <p>Police interviewer: When were those notes made doctor?</p> <p>Shipman: They would have been made the next day, hence the 12th of the 5th '98, the final entry, which says see my note nine. Because I corrected the date for her death when I - the machine - entered up the date, that I entered the entry which was 12th.</p> <p>Police interviewer: So you've corrected that to the 11th?</p> <p>Shipman: Yes. To say that she died on the 11th but the machine records the entry as on the 12th.</p> <p>Police interviewer: So these would have been done the day after?</p> <p>Shipman: Yes I wouldn't have gone back to surgery just to enter it up on the computer.</p> <p>Police interviewer: One feature of these statements from the family is that they couldn't believe their own mother had chest pains, angina, and hadn't been informed.</p> <p>Shipman: ... by whom?</p> <p>Police interviewer: By her.</p> <p>Shipman: By her, thank you.</p> <p>Police interviewer: They also found it very hard to believe that she would refuse any treatment she was given in relation to this diagnosis and I think now we can answer why that was because she didn't have a history of chest complaints and heart disease and angina did she doctor?</p> <p>Shipman: If it's written on the records then she had the history and therefore ...</p> <p>Police interviewer: The simple truth is you fabricated her history to cover what you've done, you've murdered her and made up a history of angina and chest pains so you could issue a death certificate and placate this poor woman's family, didn't you?</p> <p>Shipman: No.</p> <p>Police interviewer: We've got a statement from a detective sergeant John Ashley who works in the field of computers. He's made a thorough examination of your computer, doctor, and the medical records contained on it. First of all he's produced a medical summary report which is that document - I'll put it on the table in front of me - there's a police reference of JFA41. And, in essence, it's what you've been looking at already off this lady's medical records. A copy of the records as they stand on the computer.</p> <p>Well because this man's an expert he's able to interrogate computers and he's gone into this computer of yours in some depth and what he's found is that there are a number of entries that have been incorrectly placed on this record to falsely mislead and to indicate this woman had a history of angina and chest pains. What have you got to say about that doctor?</p> <p>Shipman: Nothing.</p> <p>Shipman's solicitor: Can I have a look at them?</p> <p>Police interviewer: I'll go through them shortly and you'll be able to see them. You attended the house at 3 o'clock and that's when you murdered this lady and so much was your rush to get back, you went back to the surgery and immediately started altering this lady's medical records. We can prove that only minutes after 3 o'clock on that date you were fabricating that false medical history for this woman. You tell me why you needed to do that?</p> <p>Shipman: There's no answer.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Well there is. There's a very clear answer: because you'd been to her house, rolled her sleeve up, administered morphine, killed her and you were covering up what you were doing. That's what happened isn't it doctor?</p> <p>Shipman: No.</p> <p>Police interviewer: You see if you examine that record which I'm going to go through with you very shortly now to give you the exact time that things were altered, it begs the question, did you alter it before you left the surgery, which indicates what you've done was premeditated and you were planning to murder this lady, or as soon as you got back did you cover up your tracks and start altering this lady's medical records? Either way it's not a good situation for you doctor is it?</p> <p>Shipman: Continue the story.</p> <p>Police interviewer: I mentioned the first print out, if you want to refer to the copy that came from exhibit AJB22, all this is is a full print with the record you have there doctor. But the officer's investigations went far further than that. I'll just remind you of the date of this lady death - 11th May '98 - perhaps you can explain to me then at three minutes and 39 seconds after 3 o'clock that afternoon you have endorsed the computer with a date of the 1st October '97 which is 10 months prior: \"chest pains\". Please look at your record there and look at the entry dated 1st August '97, would you do that for me please?</p> <p>Shipman: I've looked.</p> <p>Police interviewer: What does it say?</p> <p>Shipman: It says: \"chest pain\".</p> <p>Police interviewer: 1st of August '97. Or it starts off on that date, irrigation of external auditory canal for removal of wax hair, this practice, one ear OK.</p> <p>Shipman's solicitor: What date do you say that was?</p> <p>Police interviewer: First, this is the 1st August '97.</p> <p>Shipman's solicitor: Yeah.</p> <p>Police interviewer: I'm referring to the part that's been inserted, I'm now reading what was on there already.</p> <p>Shipman's solicitor: Right.</p> <p>Police interviewer: First, 8.97 seen in GP's surgery here, this practice, Dr HF Shipman. First, 8.97: \"chest pain, here, this practice, all appears OK, question mark, question mark, angina\". Which was what you made great comment on earlier, saying \"well look this lady's got angina - not unexpected\".</p> <p>Shipman's solicitor: Sorry which bit of that do you say was added? All of it or just the last bit?</p> <p>Police interviewer: Chest pain.</p> <p>Shipman's solicitor: Just the last bit, so there are two entries you're saying?</p> <p>Police interviewer: I'm now showing you - I'll put it in the middle of the room - so your solicitor can examine it as well then. It's an exhibit JFA42. And it's an insertion, behind your computer there's a ghost image and it records what's placed in, when and what's removed. I appreciate you're writing, when you're done I'll show you exactly together with your client. This record of information was created it on the 11.05.98 this lady's death, three minutes 39 seconds after 3 o'clock by HFS - Dr HF Shipman: \"term, chest pain, all appears OK, angina\", date: 01.08.97. And it was created on 11.05.98. Where's that information come from doctor?</p> <p>Shipman's solicitor: Can I just have a look at that?</p> <p>Police interviewer: For the benefit of the tape I've handed the exhibit to Mr Shipman's legal representative. Mr Shipman is now looking at the record himself. Thank you. I'll ask you again doctor, where's that information come from?</p> <p>Shipman: I've no recollection of me putting that on the machine.</p> <p>Police interviewer: It's your pass code, it's your name.</p> <p>Shipman: It doesn't alter the fact that I can't remember doing it.</p> <p>Police interviewer: You choose not to remember. It wasn't too long ago in this interview where you were explaining you'd been to see the family, checked the computer record, and was telling them all about this angina. Was it?</p> <p>Shipman: It's a rhetorical question.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Quite correct though isn't it?</p> <p>Shipman: I still have no recollection of entering that onto the computer.</p> <p>Police interviewer: You'd been to see this lady at 3 o'clock on the same day as her death. And you come back and alter the computer, so much so that later that evening you're telling the family exactly - \"Look: chest pains, 1st of August I saw her.\" There's three people heard you talking about it. It doesn't stop there, it goes further than that. I've got an exhibit here JFA43. If you want to look at your record there doctor, this was made at the same date - the lady's death - 11.05.98 and was put on 1505 and 21 seconds. What are you talking? - two minutes later than that first entry - 11th May. I've got it on your record doctor. 26th of the first '98, purporting to have been made: \"chest pain, odd times and exercise does not let it stop her, angina, refuses test and RX\" - I presume is referral - \"not bad enough\". How do you explain that doctor?</p> <p>Shipman: Again in the same manner as I've explained the other one, I cannot remember putting that on the computer. I'm well aware that that's how an audit trail works.</p> <p>Police interviewer: It's been placed on your computer on the same day that you've seen this patient.</p> <p>Shipman: Yes.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Hasn't it?</p> <p>Shipman: Well there's no argument about that.</p> <p>Police interviewer: And you were able to tell the family all about these entries later that evening at six o'clock. So it seems unusual to me somebody sneaked in your surgery, updated these false records in that three hour time span. Used your pass word, put your name on it and you're able to say: \"Look, I told her, she wouldn't take treatment\" - that's what that's saying there. You told her you can remember she refused the treatment and that's what's put on these false records isn't it?</p> <p>Shipman: You see you're stating the obvious, that doesn't need an answer.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Well it is obvious and I think it will be obvious why you've done it, don't you? It doesn't stop there. 11.05.98, 1506 and 49 seconds by HFS - Dr HF Shipman - a minute after the entry purporting to come from the 26th of the first '98. 01.05.98: \"Mrs Mellor seen here, this practice, term - ill, comment - very vague pain in night [inaudible word], still not wishing tests or RX to let us know if worse\". It's no wonder the family didn't know, Mrs Mellor didn't know did she? She had no angina and that's why it came as a complete shock to everybody.</p> <p>You told us at the start of this interview doctor, didn't you, you tried to update your records as soon as possible, \"as soon as practicable\" I think was the phrase you used. You tell me why the visit you say you had at your surgery from this lady on the date was not recorded until the day after, yet all this false history is?</p> <p>Shipman: I'm sorry what have you just said? That I recorded, what did I record the day after she died?</p> <p>Police interviewer: 12th of the fifth '98, 0738, well I presume that's very early in the morning for you isn't it doctor? I mean your surgery doesn't start till half eight, does it, quarter to nine I think it was? It's reported on the 12th, 11.05.98: \"angina pectoris\" - and a part on your record here about the 140 over 80 - \"no oedema, no chest - is it calf pain - only if rushes up stairs in throat, no in arms, lasted two to three ...\"</p> <p>Shipman: When are you saying I put this on the machine?</p> <p>Police interviewer: I'm not saying anything.</p> <p>Shipman: When is it being ...</p> <p>Police interviewer: ... computer records saying that it was recorded at 0738 41 seconds on the 12th of the fifth. The computer has a built in clock and times when the record was updated so you put these false records on and then ...</p> <p>Shipman: You'll find the clock is out by an hour because we don't change it for summertime.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Which way?</p> <p>Shipman: So that fact would have been put on at 8.38 the following morning.</p> <p>Police interviewer: So all these other records would have been at 1606 and would have been at 1605 and would have been at 1603 - is that what you're saying?</p> <p>Shipman: The timing seems a little awry, that's what I'm saying because the clock is not changed or we don't change the clock for summertime.</p> <p>Police interviewer: I don't think we should bother about clock timings or anything ...</p> <p>Shipman: Well you're making a great point at me being there at 7.30 in the morning.</p> <p>Police interviewer: I'm making a great point about somebody falsifying a person's record on the date of her death to fabricate a medical history for them.</p> <p>Shipman's solicitor: Can we have a consultation at this stage please?</p> <p>Police interviewer: Certainly. The time now by my watch is 1712 hours and we'll switch off the tape.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Police interviewer: Can I just hand you the medical records, again, of Winifred Mellor. It's exhibit AJB22 - that's the folder there - if you want to take the documents out - spread them out - so it's easier to refer to them in the best way you want. I'll just move that out of your way. OK. I want now to produce another exhibit for you to look at, it's a police reference OB24. Hand that to you now. It's the death certificate for Mrs Mellor. Off that certificate will you just confirm for me what you attributed her death to? Shipman: A coronary thrombosis. Police interviewer: Were there any other conditions? Shipman: Listed there? Nothing that was relevant to the cause of death. Police interviewer: Can you tell me, from whatever sources you use, how you came to that conclusion exactly that it was a coronary thrombosis? Shipman: Well the history of angina that's of increasing severity. We have a relatively sudden death. Sudden in the sense that the patient hasn't made the effort to dial 99-9 - three nines, sorry, three nines. Hasn't staggered round to the neighbours and that's often the story with elderly patients that have coronaries fairly rapidly. Police interviewer: Were there any signs on this lady's body which indicated to you that that was the cause of her death? Shipman: There are no signs on the body. Police interviewer: There are no signs? Shipman: No. Police interviewer: So you base this conclusion on the history you had of chest pain and angina? Shipman: Yes. Police interviewer: Is that the sole thing that you based on? Shipman: Yes. Police interviewer: How satisfied did you feel about that decision? Shipman: At the time, very satisfied. Police interviewer: Has that changed now? Shipman: If I'd have had a post-mortem I understand from my solicitor that there was some apharoma [phon.]. Police interviewer: Well rather than discuss it with your solicitor ... Shipman: But nothing else. Police interviewer: Can you indicate to me how severe the angina was at all? Shipman: The severity of angina doesn't indicate the likelihood of a coronary. I'm sure your medical experts would agree that. She had no signs of congested heart failure, she only got a pain if she rushed but it was lasting two to three minutes. How does one grade angina? Severe angina - you don't even get out of bed. Police interviewer: From the progression you've noted on your records this was not something that would have been expected. Shipman: This was a progressive angina. And people do die of coronaries with no preceding history of angina. Police interviewer: There's certain facts I need to make you aware of at this stage. I don't think there can be any dispute in a lot of them. Mrs Mellor's body was buried on the 18th May 1998 at Highfield Cemetery, Stockport. Would you accept that from me? Shipman: If you say. Police interviewer: Now would you also accept that the body of Mrs Mellor was exhumed with consent of the Coroner on the 22nd of September this year? Shipman: If you say so. Police interviewer: And I think, from what you were saying earlier, you were aware that a post-mortem examination was subsequently undertaken. Certain samples were taken at that post-mortem for forensic analysis. Would you accept that? Shipman: You're telling the story, yes of course. Police interviewer: A Home Office pathologist - Dr Rutherford - carried out that post-mortem examination. I think as you were going to mention, his findings do not support that this lady died of a coronary thrombosis as you diagnosed. Would you like to make any comment on that - that finding? Shipman: Doctors don't always diagnose a heart attack as a heart attack, they'll call it a coronary thrombosis or myocardial ischaemia or myocardial infarction. To the average run of the mill GP they are all the same - the patient's dead. With a coronary thrombosis you'd expect that there'd be a bit of heart that's sort of damaged but you can have had just an electrical disorganisation of the heart which kills you just as effectively and leaves no symptoms at all - no signs, sorry, signs at all. Police interviewer: Well in his expert opinion there was nothing to support your diagnosis is what I'm saying. Shipman: And he couldn't rule out a disorganised electrical activity in the heart. Police interviewer: Forensic examination of the samples taken, including muscle tissue, at that post-mortem have been examined. These are the samples taken from Mrs Mellor. And there's certainly a high level of morphine still contained in her body - a fatal level to be precise. Can you account for that? Shipman: No. Police interviewer: I'd like to put it to you doctor that you were the person who administered that lady with the drug aren't you? Shipman: No. Police interviewer: The levels were such that this woman actually died from toxicity of morphine, not as you wrongly diagnosed - in plain speaking you murdered her. Shipman: No. Police interviewer: An expert has examined the drug this lady's been prescribed, from the records you looked to earlier within the exhibit - AJB22 - and from those records nothing has been found which could account for the morphine in her body. Can you suggest how it's got there? Shipman: No. Police interviewer: From your records, which you've had access to for some time now, can you point out where the visits you made to Mrs Mellor are indicated on the records? Shipman: Which visits are we talking about? Police interviewer: Well you said there was a visit in the morning. Shipman: No I said that she came to surgery. Says here at his practice. Police interviewer: Can you just show me where that is? Shipman: I thought we'd got this perfectly clear, the 11th of the 11th here. Police interviewer: So that's on page nine and it's the second entry 11.05.98 - angina pectoris. I don't understand what these terms mean here. Perhaps you could explain that for me, is this the right place I'm looking at? Shipman: Yes that's the right place you're looking at. And I read that record out to you on the previous tape and if you wish I'll do it again. Police interviewer: Please. Shipman: Blood pressure's 140 over 80. The heart sounds were normal, no oedema, no sign of heart failure. Pain only if she rushes upstairs in - and it's in the throat and now in the arms. It lasts for possibly two or three minutes, it gets better all the time - meaning when she stays still it goes away. Refuses treatment. Police interviewer: Now you told us you went back to Mrs Mellor's home when you found her dead at roughly quarter past six, I believe it was, where is the record of that please? Shipman: I went back? You know I went, for the first time, to see her dead. Police interviewer: Well now you're saying it's the first time before you said you couldn't remember, which is it? Shipman: Well you're taking it that it's a repeat visit, I'm correcting you in saying I can't remember visiting at 3 o'clock, so for me this is the first visit. Police interviewer: Where's the record of that visit? Shipman: The record is on the front of the record there - 11.05.98 coronary thrombosis cause of death. Police interviewer: And then there was a further visit later on with the family, is there a record of that? Shipman: No. Police interviewer: Would you not normally make a record of that? Shipman: No. Shipman's solicitor: There is, sorry, just to clarify, there's another entry on 11.05.98 Owen [sic.] dead. Shipman: There that's fine: \"Called in to see her 6.15 - dead, coronary thrombosis, daughter Linda present.\" I'm afraid both of us missed that, second entry from the bottom. Police interviewer: So on this case, as well as making a written record on the front of your manila folder you've also got computer entry? Shipman: Yes. Police interviewer: When were those notes made doctor? Shipman: They would have been made the next day, hence the 12th of the 5th '98, the final entry, which says see my note nine. Because I corrected the date for her death when I - the machine - entered up the date, that I entered the entry which was 12th. Police interviewer: So you've corrected that to the 11th? Shipman: Yes. To say that she died on the 11th but the machine records the entry as on the 12th. Police interviewer: So these would have been done the day after? Shipman: Yes I wouldn't have gone back to surgery just to enter it up on the computer. Police interviewer: One feature of these statements from the family is that they couldn't believe their own mother had chest pains, angina, and hadn't been informed. Shipman: ... by whom? Police interviewer: By her. Shipman: By her, thank you. Police interviewer: They also found it very hard to believe that she would refuse any treatment she was given in relation to this diagnosis and I think now we can answer why that was because she didn't have a history of chest complaints and heart disease and angina did she doctor? Shipman: If it's written on the records then she had the history and therefore ... Police interviewer: The simple truth is you fabricated her history to cover what you've done, you've murdered her and made up a history of angina and chest pains so you could issue a death certificate and placate this poor woman's family, didn't you? Shipman: No. Police interviewer: We've got a statement from a detective sergeant John Ashley who works in the field of computers. He's made a thorough examination of your computer, doctor, and the medical records contained on it. First of all he's produced a medical summary report which is that document - I'll put it on the table in front of me - there's a police reference of JFA41. And, in essence, it's what you've been looking at already off this lady's medical records. A copy of the records as they stand on the computer. Well because this man's an expert he's able to interrogate computers and he's gone into this computer of yours in some depth and what he's found is that there are a number of entries that have been incorrectly placed on this record to falsely mislead and to indicate this woman had a history of angina and chest pains. What have you got to say about that doctor? Shipman: Nothing. Shipman's solicitor: Can I have a look at them? Police interviewer: I'll go through them shortly and you'll be able to see them. You attended the house at 3 o'clock and that's when you murdered this lady and so much was your rush to get back, you went back to the surgery and immediately started altering this lady's medical records. We can prove that only minutes after 3 o'clock on that date you were fabricating that false medical history for this woman. You tell me why you needed to do that? Shipman: There's no answer. Police interviewer: Well there is. There's a very clear answer: because you'd been to her house, rolled her sleeve up, administered morphine, killed her and you were covering up what you were doing. That's what happened isn't it doctor? Shipman: No. Police interviewer: You see if you examine that record which I'm going to go through with you very shortly now to give you the exact time that things were altered, it begs the question, did you alter it before you left the surgery, which indicates what you've done was premeditated and you were planning to murder this lady, or as soon as you got back did you cover up your tracks and start altering this lady's medical records? Either way it's not a good situation for you doctor is it? Shipman: Continue the story. Police interviewer: I mentioned the first print out, if you want to refer to the copy that came from exhibit AJB22, all this is is a full print with the record you have there doctor. But the officer's investigations went far further than that. I'll just remind you of the date of this lady death - 11th May '98 - perhaps you can explain to me then at three minutes and 39 seconds after 3 o'clock that afternoon you have endorsed the computer with a date of the 1st October '97 which is 10 months prior: \"chest pains\". Please look at your record there and look at the entry dated 1st August '97, would you do that for me please? Shipman: I've looked. Police interviewer: What does it say? Shipman: It says: \"chest pain\". Police interviewer: 1st of August '97. Or it starts off on that date, irrigation of external auditory canal for removal of wax hair, this practice, one ear OK. Shipman's solicitor: What date do you say that was? Police interviewer: First, this is the 1st August '97. Shipman's solicitor: Yeah. Police interviewer: I'm referring to the part that's been inserted, I'm now reading what was on there already. Shipman's solicitor: Right. Police interviewer: First, 8.97 seen in GP's surgery here, this practice, Dr HF Shipman. First, 8.97: \"chest pain, here, this practice, all appears OK, question mark, question mark, angina\". Which was what you made great comment on earlier, saying \"well look this lady's got angina - not unexpected\". Shipman's solicitor: Sorry which bit of that do you say was added? All of it or just the last bit? Police interviewer: Chest pain. Shipman's solicitor: Just the last bit, so there are two entries you're saying? Police interviewer: I'm now showing you - I'll put it in the middle of the room - so your solicitor can examine it as well then. It's an exhibit JFA42. And it's an insertion, behind your computer there's a ghost image and it records what's placed in, when and what's removed. I appreciate you're writing, when you're done I'll show you exactly together with your client. This record of information was created it on the 11.05.98 this lady's death, three minutes 39 seconds after 3 o'clock by HFS - Dr HF Shipman: \"term, chest pain, all appears OK, angina\", date: 01.08.97. And it was created on 11.05.98. Where's that information come from doctor? Shipman's solicitor: Can I just have a look at that?

The computer has a built in clock and times when the record was updated so you put these false records on and then ... Shipman: You'll find the clock is out by an hour because we don't change it for summertime. Police interviewer: Which way? Shipman: So that fact would have been put on at 8.38 the following morning. Police interviewer: So all these other records would have been at 1606 and would have been at 1605 and would have been at 1603 - is that what you're saying? Shipman: The timing seems a little awry, that's what I'm saying because the clock is not changed or we don't change the clock for summertime. Police interviewer: I don't think we should bother about clock timings or anything ... Shipman: Well you're making a great point at me being there at 7.30 in the morning. Police interviewer: I'm making a great point about somebody falsifying a person's record on the date of her death to fabricate a medical history for them. Shipman's solicitor: Can we have a consultation at this stage please? Police interviewer: Certainly. The time now by my watch is 1712 hours and we'll switch off the tape.",

Can you tell me why there is no reference there to taking any blood product?</p> <p>Shipman: Normally blood results came back two days later.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Why was there no actual update?</p> <p>Shipman: I've got no explanation</p> <p>Police interviewer: Could it have been an oversight?</p> <p>Shipman: It could have been. I don't know why there is no entry.</p> <p>Police interviewer: You said that on the 23rd when she came to see you in the surgery you were concerned that she felt unwell. Do you recall saying that?</p> <p>Shipman: I think the thing was she was frail and elderly.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Is that from a visual observation?</p> <p>Shipman: Yes, she didn't look as well as she normally did.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Were there any other symptoms?</p> <p>Shipman: Nothing more than just the visual observations.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Now, at the bottom of the page the entry is actually dated the 24th June. Can I suggest to you that that is a backdated entry? It was made perhaps on the morning 24th June. It actually relates to the visit made by Mrs Grundy to your surgery on the 23rd? You claim that entry refers to the morning home visit on the 24th. There is no mention of a home visit - you claimed it was an error.</p> <p>Shipman: It's an error.</p> <p>Police interviewer: There is no mention in that entry which you claim to be that date about taking a blood sample from her. I can see what you are pointing at - HBESR. It does not actually say you took a blood sample from her.</p> <p>Shipman: Hmm, it's not the custom of most general practioners to write: \"I have taken a blood sample which would consist of this, this and this\". Most general practioners just write down what the blood test is they are doing.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Can I suggest to you that that entry dated the 24th is actually referring to the visit by Mrs Grundy on 23rd. The sole purpose, from what you tell us, of the visit on the 24th was simply to take a blood sample. It was not check her pulse, or her chest or her abdomen and other things. Was that the case?</p> <p>Shipman: No.</p> <p>[interview continues for about another four and half minutes]</p> <p>Police interviewer: Where do you keep dangerous drugs in your practice?</p> <p>Shipman: I do not have any DDAs on the premises, in my car, I don't have a dangerous drugs book.</p> <p>Police interviewer: That being the case, and you don't keep dangerous drugs on the premises, where do you access dangerous drugs to treat terminally ill patients?</p> <p>Shipman: I would issue a prescription to the relatives or in an emergency situation I would issue the prescription, pick it up from the chemist and deliver directly to the house. And that is the only time I would touch them. The giving of the drugs would be down to the district nurse, the Macmillan nurse, or whoever it was.</p> <p>Police interviewer: What happens, say, if one of your patients dies from a terminal illness. You are aware that they have whatever-it-is in the way of dangerous drugs on them. What happens to those drugs?</p> <p>Shipman: Drugs are usually destroyed by the district nurse in the presence of the patient's relatives. I would never take drugs away.</p> <p>Police interviewer: What drugs would you routinely carry with you day-to-day?</p> <p>Shipman: Antibiotic samples, sleeping tablets, some valium, centimetrim, diuretic, (plus others)</p> <p>Police interviewer: Let's move on to Mrs Grundy's will. I mentioned to you earlier on in the will that you were named as the sole beneficiary of her estate, all her monies, etc, which you said came as a complete surprise to you.</p> <p>Shipman: Yes.</p> <p>Police interviewer: That will was found to be forged. The signatures Spencer and Hutchinson were forgeries. They were not the signatures which they made in your surgery on the 9th June. There is also on the will form, the document itself, an indentation of the practiced forgery, the practiced signatures shall we say, of Kathleen Grundy. What I am saying to you is the will is a complete and utter forgery. Do you have any comments to make about that?</p> <p>Shipman: No. I have no comment to make.</p> <p>Police interviewer: The will was received at Hamiltons solictors with an accompanying letter which we'll show you, we'll show you the will. As I mentioned earlier, there was an existing, comprehensive will made out in 1986 which was held by Kathleen Grundy's solicitors. Have you seen that will form before?</p> <p>Shipman: No</p> <p>Police interviewer: When Spencer and Hutchinson signed in your surgery as witnesses did you see or notice any part of the form. The reasons why I ask is that one of those persons remembers seeing the words at the top 'last will and testament'.</p> <p>Shipman: What I saw was Mrs Grundy holding my pen, signing and then I saw the two people signing.</p> <p>Police interviewer: I'll pass you a letter. It's dated the 28th of June. It was received by Hamiltons on the 30th. It's marked D22. What knowledge do you have of that letter?</p> <p>Shipman: None.</p> <p>Police interviewer: The letters in the will were all typed on your Brother typewriter. Can you account for that?</p> <p>Shipman: No.</p> <p>Police interviewer: The letter signed S Smith doesn't come with an address. Mrs Smith, as far as we are concerned does not exist. The letter was clearly sent after Mrs Grundy's death. Can you account for that doctor?</p> <p>Shipman: I cannot.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Who would have had access to yourtypewriter after Mrs Grundy's death?</p> <p>Shipman: The question is when was it returned to the surgery and that: I do not know.</p> <p>Police interviewer: You mention, you allege, Mrs Grundy borrowed the typewriter on two or three occasions. You don't know when, you don't know who may have witnessed her borrowing the typewriter. We're talking here about a lady who's 81 who we would imagine have some difficulty carrying a typewriter. I am asking who would have used your typewriter after 24th June to type that letter?</p> <p>Shipman: I am saying that I don't know.</p> <p>Police interviewer: This was a typewriter that was kept in your surgery.</p> <p>Shipman: This was a typewriter that was loaned out to Mrs Grundy on two or three occasions.</p> <p>Police interviewer: This was a typewriter that was used to produce that letter after her death.</p> <p>Shipman: I am saying I am not sure when the typewriter was returned to my surgery.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Where was the typewriter on the 24th June</p> <p>Shipman: I have no idea.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Can I put it directly to you doctor that you forged, you produced the letters of this will from your typewriter in the hope of benefitting from Mrs Grundy's estate</p> <p>Shipman: Is that a question or a statement?</p> <p>Police interviewer: I put it to you that that is the case.</p> <p>Shipman: That is not the case.</p> <p>Police interviewer: I put it to you that you are responsible, you are the author of the letters and you manufactured the will. You forged the signatures.</p> <p>Shipman: And I am saying I didn't do it.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Mrs Grundy was exhumed on the 1st August this year and there were extensive tests, toxicology. I'll quote what the forensic scientist said to us. \"Her death is consistent with the use or administration of a significant quantity of morphine or diamorphine and similar values have been seen in fatalities attributed to morphine overdoses.\" Do you have any comments to make about that?</p> <p>Shipman's solictor: I think we need to go back to some earlier entries in the GP notes.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Do you want to look at them?</p> <p>Shipman's solicitor: Yup.</p> <p>Shipman: If you back to the entry 12 of the 10th '96. Here I commented: \"IBS again, odd pupils, small, constipated, drug abuse?,\" I have written: \"At her age? Codeine?\" Meaning I am wondering if she is taking codeine tablets. \"Wait and see\".</p> <p>So then in July, I deliberately made the comment that she is having these IBS attacks every day. \"Pupils small, dry mouth, possible drug abuse again, denies taking any drug other than for IBS. I am sure you are well aware that drugs like morphine, heroin, pethedine, all cause constipation, all cause small pupils. My comments on the 26th of the 11th. \"IBS again. Should I do a blood test and check the urine?\" I am sure you are aware to do a blood test and check urine against the patient's consent is not a legal event.</p> <p>Really difficult if she denies everything. She is not really at risk. She is not an intravenous user as far as I was aware. I am not sure. Still, clinically, nothing of note to confirm my suspicions. \"Wait and see.\" So over that period of time, I wondered very seriously whether this lady was taking drugs other than which I had prescribed. And I will come back to the osteoporosis because that is what I believed she was doing. I believed she was taking something other than what I had prescribed for the osteoporosis. I would only be guessing where she got it from?</p> <p>Police interviewer: Are you seriously suggesting that Mrs Grundy, a well-respected lady, who had a decent life, inflicted a fatal overdose upon herself? Are you really suggesting that to us?</p> <p>Shipman: And I ask whether the house was searched?</p> <p>Police interviewer: Yes. There were no drugs whatsoever that could cause a fatality, according to the findings we have got.</p> <p>Shipman's solictor: Well, when was it searched?</p> <p>Police interviewer: I haven't got those dates to hand of the search.</p> <p>Shipman: That's quite important.</p> <p>Police interviewer: But are you suggesting doctor that...</p> <p>Shipman: I am not suggesting anything. I am just saying my fears and worries of this lady at that time.</p> <p>Police interviewer: I have given you the cause of death. A fatal overdose of morphine or diamorphine. And I have asked you to comment.</p> <p>Shipman: And I have commented. I have said that I had my suspicions that she was abusing a narcotic of some sort, or at least taking a narcotic of some sort over a period of a year or so. [He refers to an earlier GP who wrote about her medication.] I am not suggesting she took drugs every day. Far from it. But the scenario was there. She did have drugs available and she may well have accidentally given herself an overdose.</p> <p>Police interviewer: The scenario is this. You tell us are you are involved in some ageing survey [mentioned earlier in the interview].</p> <p>Shipman: I am not telling you I am not involved in an ageing survey. I am involved with care of elderly patients as recommended by the Government in their Health of the Nation [document] which involves looking after elderly patients.</p> <p>[The police tape then jumps to later questioning]</p> <p>Police interviewer: I suggest to you that you have injected Mrs Grundy with a fatal overdose of morphine.</p> <p>Shipman: [Emphatic] No. And you tell me that people in Hyde don't have access to drugs. I think you should talk to your drugs squad.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Is it not a coincidence or significant that you are the sole beneficiary, or would have been a sole beneficiary, of a forged will. There is nobody else who could have sent that letter who had an interest in the estate of Mrs Grundy other than yourself, after her death. Is that not the case?</p> <p>Shipman's solicitor: It could have been anyone with a deranged mind who could have sent that.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Not with the doctor's typewriter they couldn't. And who would have been aware that the doctor was to benefit from the estate? And who would have been aware that the will had been deposited with Hamilton Wards when the original will had been with the daughter. Would you agree that there is no medical history which would support Mrs Grundy's very sudden death?</p> <p>Shipman: People do die suddenly of old age. They just wear out.</p> <p>Police interviewer: Would it not have been of interest to you, professionally, given that she was one of your patients involved in the ageing survey?</p> <p>[Talk over each other]</p> <p>Shipman:It was the Health of the Nation project for over 75s, if you are going to talk about a specialised survey, I was not taking part in a specialised survey, we are just looking after elderly in the way we do it. So no, I don't think it was peculiar not to ask for a post mortem.</p> <p>[Pause]</p> <p>Police interviewer: You're looking at me again, doctor?</p> <p>Shipman: So is your colleague</p> <p>Police interviewer: We'll ask you a question. re the drugs. You don't keep drugs in your surgery. Is that correct?</p> <p>Shipman: I keep no drugs, you are talking about controlled drugs, in my surgery, my car or at home.</p> <p>[mutterings in background]</p> <p>Police interviewer: I think at that point we'll conclude things. We'll have a short break. We stop this tape at four minutes past two.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Dr Harold Shipman has today been found guilty of murdering 15 female patients while working at his Manchester surgery.</p> <p>As Shipman was receiving 15 life sentences, sources close to the investigation confirmed that files on the deaths of 23 other patients have been submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service with a view to bringing further murder charges against the 54-year-old married father of four.</p> <p>Mr Justice Forbes, the trial judge at Preston crown court, told Shipman that he would \"spend the remainder of your days in prison\" for his \"wicked, wicked crimes\".</p> <p>\"In your case life must mean life,\" he said.</p> <p>A jury of seven men and five women delivered the verdicts after six days of deliberations, bringing an end to a four-month trial in which more than 120 witnesses were called. Shipman had denied all the charges.</p> <p>Shipman, who becomes one of the worst serial killers in modern British history, was found guilty of murdering Kathleen Grundy, 81, by injecting her with heroin on June 24, 1998.</p> <p>In addition, he was convicted of forging widow Mrs Grundy's \u00a3386,000 will, an act which led to his arrest in August 1998. Shipman received an additional four-year sentence for this charge.</p> <p>The jury also found Shipman, from Mottram, near Hyde, Greater Manchester, guilty of the murder of Bianka Pomfret, 49, Winifred Mellor, 73, Joan Melia, 73, Ivy Lomas, 63, Marie Quinn, 67, Irene Turner, 67, Jean Lilley, 59, Muriel Grimshaw, 76, Marie West, 81, Lizzie Adams, 77, Kathleen Wagstaff, 81, Norah Nuttall, 65, Pamela Hillier, 68, Maureen Ward, 57.</p> <p>He killed all 15 women between March 1995 and June 1998.</p> <p>Harold Shipman ran a thriving practice with 3,100 patients. His defence argued that the case against him was based solely on \"unreliable and unsafe\" scientific evidence of the levels of morphine found in the bodies of his victims.</p> <p>But in the end the jury was convinced by the overwhelming weight of evidence that made it, in the words of Mr Richard Henriques QC, prosecuting, \"quite incredible\" that all 15 patients could have suddenly died natural deaths on the very day they were seen by the GP.</p> <p>Shipman stockpiled vast quantities of morphine and then used it to kill his victims by giving them a lethal injection.</p> <p>He was not licensed - by his own choice - to hold drugs at his surgery, probably because of his conviction for misuse of drugs more than 20 years earlier, but obtained the morphine and diamorphine by prescribing it for other patients who did not need it, or who had died.</p> <p>Detectives remained baffled about the motivations for many of the murders. In only one known case - that of his last victim, wealthy widow Kathleen Grundy - did the GP stand to benefit financially, through his clumsy attempt to forge her \u00a3350,000 will.</p> <p>Police concluded that Shipman was probably motivated to murder by his desire for control, which developed into an obsession with the power of life and death. Detective chief inspector Mike Williams, who interviewed the GP, said: \"He likes control, and the ultimate control is over life and death.\"</p>",

As Shipman was receiving 15 life sentences, sources close to the investigation confirmed that files on the deaths of 23 other patients have been submitted to the Crown Prosecution Service with a view to bringing further murder charges against the 54-year-old married father of four. Mr Justice Forbes, the trial judge at Preston crown court, told Shipman that he would \"spend the remainder of your days in prison\" for his \"wicked, wicked crimes\". \"In your case life must mean life,\" he said. A jury of seven men and five women delivered the verdicts after six days of deliberations, bringing an end to a four-month trial in which more than 120 witnesses were called. Shipman had denied all the charges. Shipman, who becomes one of the worst serial killers in modern British history, was found guilty of murdering Kathleen Grundy, 81, by injecting her with heroin on June 24, 1998. In addition, he was convicted of forging widow Mrs Grundy's \u00a3386,000 will, an act which led to his arrest in August 1998. Shipman received an additional four-year sentence for this charge. The jury also found Shipman, from Mottram, near Hyde, Greater Manchester, guilty of the murder of Bianka Pomfret, 49, Winifred Mellor, 73, Joan Melia, 73, Ivy Lomas, 63, Marie Quinn, 67, Irene Turner, 67, Jean Lilley, 59, Muriel Grimshaw, 76, Marie West, 81, Lizzie Adams, 77, Kathleen Wagstaff, 81, Norah Nuttall, 65, Pamela Hillier, 68, Maureen Ward, 57. He killed all 15 women between March 1995 and June 1998. Harold Shipman ran a thriving practice with 3,100 patients. His defence argued that the case against him was based solely on \"unreliable and unsafe\" scientific evidence of the levels of morphine found in the bodies of his victims. But in the end the jury was convinced by the overwhelming weight of evidence that made it, in the words of Mr Richard Henriques QC, prosecuting, \"quite incredible\" that all 15 patients could have suddenly died natural deaths on the very day they were seen by the GP. Shipman stockpiled vast quantities of morphine and then used it to kill his victims by giving them a lethal injection. He was not licensed - by his own choice - to hold drugs at his surgery, probably because of his conviction for misuse of drugs more than 20 years earlier, but obtained the morphine and diamorphine by prescribing it for other patients who did not need it, or who had died. Detectives remained baffled about the motivations for many of the murders. In only one known case - that of his last victim, wealthy widow Kathleen Grundy - did the GP stand to benefit financially, through his clumsy attempt to forge her \u00a3350,000 will. Police concluded that Shipman was probably motivated to murder by his desire for control, which developed into an obsession with the power of life and death. Detective chief inspector Mike Williams, who interviewed the GP, said: \"He likes control, and the ultimate control is over life and death.\"",

What would be the first thing you'd do after breaking all the rules in football? That's right, you'd tell the press about it.</p> <p>After struggling Portsmouth's 3-0 first division win over third placed Barnsley on Saturday, an understandably jubilant Claridge revealed he was \"disgusted\" at the odds on a Portsmouth victory offered by local bookies Flutters. \"When you look at the odds, we were something like 7/2 or 3/1 for a home win, I think that's an insult to us\" he said, adding, \"We've all had a good bet on it and won a few bob.\"</p> <p>Hurrah.

That means players, managers and coaching staff. We will be making enquiries about this later this week and we will be speaking to Steve Claridge.\"</p> <p>Speaking today, Steve was less cock-a-hoop. \"I didn't know we had done anything wrong - we were all backing ourselves to win the game,\" said Steve proving that footballers aren't only motivated by a love of the sport. \"It was just a bit of fun,\" he went on, dropping to his knees and hugging the reporter. \"We made a bit of money but we're not going to be able to retire on it - let's not turn this into something it's not.\" Imagine once again that you're Steve Claridge.

According to Greg discussions on a new contract are like two dogs meeting in a park: \"We're just having a look at each other and seeing if we like each other. We're in no rush.\" Beni however is already on to the arse-sniffing stage, so to speak. While he mainly gave the credit for yesterday's hat-trick to his lucky blue boots (\"I was lying in bed the other night thinking about the game coming up with Leeds when I suddenly remembered an old pair of boots I had in the cupboard. I got up and went and found them and they felt good as soon as I touched them. I really love the boots\") he was also full of praise for the team (\"I really love them\").</p> <p>So are Beni and Gregory ever destined to chase each other's tail? According to Greg, if Beni repeats his dazzling performance against Leeds, he \"won't let him out of the ground\".

After struggling Portsmouth's 3-0 first division win over third placed Barnsley on Saturday, an understandably jubilant Claridge revealed he was \"disgusted\" at the odds on a Portsmouth victory offered by local bookies Flutters. \"When you look at the odds, we were something like 7/2 or 3/1 for a home win, I think that's an insult to us\" he said, adding, \"We've all had a good bet on it and won a few bob.\" Hurrah. But thanks to the immediacy of the media, it wasn't long before those spoilsports at the FA found out, and reliable spokesperson Steve Double was wheeled out to spew some invective. \"Nobody connected directly with the game is permitted to bet on football, full-stop. That means players, managers and coaching staff. We will be making enquiries about this later this week and we will be speaking to Steve Claridge.\" Speaking today, Steve was less cock-a-hoop. \"I didn't know we had done anything wrong - we were all backing ourselves to win the game,\" said Steve proving that footballers aren't only motivated by a love of the sport. \"It was just a bit of fun,\" he went on, dropping to his knees and hugging the reporter. \"We made a bit of money but we're not going to be able to retire on it - let's not turn this into something it's not.\" Imagine once again that you're Steve Claridge. Would you be appealing to the FA for common sense? * * * * * * * * * * * * * HUGGER MUGGER Football's Mr Inclined To Psychological Warfare John Gregory knows a thing or two about showing appreciation where appreciation is due. After mercilessly mocking Gareth Southgate for scoring the goals that saved his job, Gregory yesterday described how the best of Benito Carbone's three FA cup tie-winning efforts yesterday would \"usually end up in the Holte End\". What's more Gregory is in no hurry to sign the loveable little Italian up beyond the end of the season. According to Greg discussions on a new contract are like two dogs meeting in a park: \"We're just having a look at each other and seeing if we like each other. We're in no rush.\" Beni however is already on to the arse-sniffing stage, so to speak. While he mainly gave the credit for yesterday's hat-trick to his lucky blue boots (\"I was lying in bed the other night thinking about the game coming up with Leeds when I suddenly remembered an old pair of boots I had in the cupboard. I got up and went and found them and they felt good as soon as I touched them. I really love the boots\") he was also full of praise for the team (\"I really love them\"). So are Beni and Gregory ever destined to chase each other's tail? According to Greg, if Beni repeats his dazzling performance against Leeds, he \"won't let him out of the ground\". And as Stan Collymore can vouch, once you're locked in Gregory's loving embrace at fortress Villa Park, there is no easy escape. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Brazilian striker Jardel has gone on record to declare his interest in playing for Leeds. Porto's record-breaking forward told the press: \"Leeds are having a great season, they are going for the Premiership title. I am pleased to know about their interest at Elland Road in my qualities.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Confusion reigns over Muzzy Izzet's international future. According to reports on the Reuters newswire Izzet has decided to play for Turkey in Euro 2000. \"I've made up my mind to play for Turkey,\" the report quotes the Leicester midfielder as saying, \"I'm looking forward it it, as long as I get it in writing and confirmed properly.\" However, the official Foxes website quotes Izzet as saying he will not make a decision until after Wednesday's Worthington Cup semi-final second leg tie with Aston Villa. Charlton Athletic will not be relocating to the Millennium Dome site. PLC chairman Richard Murray said \"The board has fully evaluated the financial aspects of building a new stadium on the Greenwich Peninsula and the projected cost of \u00a342million and the absence of significant grant aid made the project financially unattractive.\" Blackpool striker Martin Aldridge has died following a car crash. Aldridge, who was on loan at Rushden and Diamonds, was travelling in a Peugeot which collided with a BMW on the A45 near Wellingborough in Northamptonshire on Saturday evening. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO BBC 1: Match of the Day (10.40pm) Highlights of Blackburn v Newcastle.

In the oak-panelled courtroom with its brass-railed dock, the 54-year-old GP from Mottram, near Hyde, Greater Manchester, was accused of being Britain's most prolific serial killer. He faced 15 charges that he murdered his women patients, aged between 49 and 81, and forged the \u00a3386,000 will of one of them, former Hyde mayoress Kathleen Grundy, a wealthy widow who lived alone. Throughout the trial, Shipman remained convinced of his own innocence, though few agreed with him as the evidence unfolded in court one. He denied that he knew anything about the deaths of the 15 women, despite a barrage of evidence which suggested otherwise. No, he did not inject any of the women with morphine. Yes, he had called ambulances, despite grieving relatives' evidence to the contrary. No, he had not forged the will of Kathleen Grundy, but she had occasionally borrowed his battered Brother typewriter from the surgery. When the time came for him to give evidence, the trial had to be adjourned twice as he broke down. Once while giving evidence about one of the murders, Shipman was so overcome by emotion that he began to cry. Then, several days later when prosecution counsel Richard Henriques QC rose to cross-examine him, he looked across at the judge, Mr Justice Forbes, and muttered: \"I don't feel well.\" The trial was adjourned once more. Shipman's voice appeared shaky when he started to give evidence and he apologised for his slurred speech, which he blamed on the tablets he was taking. A hushed courtroom listened in disbelief as he outlined his suspicion that Kathleen Grundy, 81, had been abusing drugs, although she had denied it. The public gallery was often filled with Dr Shipman's former patients, friends and family as well as those who were merely curious about how a seemingly unassuming GP could murder 15 patients. Shipman's wife Primrose was there in the front row every day, loyally supporting her husband. Occasionally their four children were in court next to her. On several occasions Mrs Shipman smiled wanly at her husband as he was led away from the dock into the cells. On the first day of the trial, the pensioners and middle-aged men and women in the public gallery remained silent as the charges against the doctor were read out.

According to Media Monitoring Services in 1999, they spent some \u00a368m trying to do it - not an enormous amount in absolute terms, but impressive nonetheless given that it is all new money. </p> <p>This year, that \u00a368m is likely to be doubled if not trebled. Dozens of start-ups and new internet operations are now happily spending the money they fought so hard to raise last year, and there is scarcely an internet venture in town that is not planning to spend \u00a32-3m over the next 12 months, with plenty of others planning to spend \u00a310m or more (last year's biggest spender was Freeserve at \u00a39.25m). </p> <p>A quick scan of this week's media trade press gives a fair reflection of the current dot com advertising frenzy. In Media Week's list of recent advertising account wins, for example, six out of 14 most recent wins are internet companies - representing some \u00a348m spending, and in pretty much every case they are companies that did not exist two years ago. </p> <p>Now this surge is both good and bad. The good side is that pretty much every bit of advertising for every internet company is good for the medium as a whole. It is as if there is a huge mass of marketing talent currently dedicated to getting the 80% of the population that is not online to make the leap. Even the dot com-fusion caused by the sheer deluge of advertising messages is OK. The overriding impression is that there is plenty of good and useful stuff on the net, relevant to real people. </p> <p> The bad side is that most of those currently chucking money around are not going to get what they want from it. They want to see surges in traffic and sales that will impress venture capitalists and potential investors. In truth, many will end up squabbling with and sacking their agencies who talk about things like \"awareness\" and \"long-term brand building\" - which are nice, but little comfort in the current commercial battlefield. There are two reasons for this. The most obvious is that not every company can succeed, some simply aren't good enough - and we can expect plenty of commercial casualties over the next year. </p> <p>The other is that with so many people currently shouting so loudly, it is impossible for anyone to make themselves heard. One solution is simply to shout loudest - in other words, just chuck more money at the problem. Competitor spending \u00a35m? Right, let's spend \u00a36m. The other option is obviously to try and spend that money more smartly - invest in creative work and a media strategy that really stands out. </p> <p>Take two stories in this week's trade press. In one it was reported that the Financial Times had booked one in every five poster sites in Britain for a week as part of a \u00a37.5m blitz to promote FT Your Money, its personal finance site. Elsewhere it was revealed (if that is not too strong a word) that one of FT Your Money's main rivals, Motley Fool, had appointed \"the communications consultancy\" Michaelides &amp; Bednash to \"develop creative and distinctive communication ideas to make the Motley Fool site stand out from the increasing clutter of dotcom advertising.\" </p> <p> Motley Fool's US budget is only $6m, so it is unlikely they will ever match FT Your Money. So, does it stand a chance? It would be nice to picture this as a battle between big money and smart money, but in truth, it is going to be a battle between big smart money and small smart money. That, however, does not mean we should dismiss the Fool, because, for all this frenzy, advertising is simply part of the rather complex mix of processes involved in getting people to your site and, most important of all, getting them to come back to you again. </p> <p>Boo.com, for example, did almost everything right by the marketing handbook. Great name, good ads, plenty of hype. Unfortunately its launch was plagued with technical difficulties, it was slated, and almost certainly lost many of the customers its advertising attracted. </p> <p> Yahoo on the other hand has yet to produce a half-decent ad. In fact, it has hardly produced any advertising at all. Last year, according to MMS, it spent little more than \u00a391,000. However, I and millions of others use its site and services pretty much every day. How have they done it?

Yahoo on the other hand has yet to produce a half-decent ad. In fact, it has hardly produced any advertising at all. Last year, according to MMS, it spent little more than \u00a391,000. However, I and millions of others use its site and services pretty much every day. How have they done it? Perhaps you should really ask that question to the next ad agency that insists you have to spend \u00a310m on TV in order to build your online business.

      "body": "<p>Commentators tend to talk interminably about the way the world's politics and economics are being globalised. But investigative journalists, too, are now learning how they must go global. </p> <p>The revelations commencing today in the Guardian about cigarette giant BAT's involvement with smuggled products have emerged from an investigation carried out worldwide, via a novel journalistic organisation. The findings, now complete, are being released more or less simultaneously through sympathetic media outlets in Europe, Australia, North America and South America. </p> <p>The BAT story is the first fruit from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The ICIJ is a collection of people from around the world, under the aegis of a smallish Washington-based organisation, the Center for Public Integrity. </p> <p>The ICIJ communicates via the internet and a system of secure emails. Its existence demonstrates that it is possible to use the net not merely as a source of information, but as a means of bringing journalists together to work in a new way. We can do much more complicated things, and do them in more places, with more people, than ever before. </p> <p>With luck, this is the kind of creative thinking which is going to go a little way towards helping journalism catch up with the activities of mega-corporations and mega power blocs. </p> <p>I first encountered the ICIJ a little more than a year ago, when I got a letter from Washington inviting me to join a body I'd never heard of. They assured me rapidly that no payment of money was involved, but that it was a means of giving work to experienced investigative journalists. A free plane ticket to Boston followed, with an invitation to spend a weekend at Harvard university helping set the scheme up at its inaugural conference. </p> <p>Any doubts I had dissolved, when I realised my two fellow founder-members from the UK were extremely distinguished. One was Duncan Campbell - not the Guardian's Los Angeles correspondent, but the veteran Edinburgh-based investigator who has helped expose government intelligence agency eavesdropping over two decades, in the teeth of more injunctions and official secrets act prosecutions than most. </p> <p>And the other was Australian-born Phillip Knightley, whose fame rests on breaking open the Kim Philby scandal for the old pre-Murdoch Sunday Times, and whose recent autobiography A Hack's Progress is a classic. </p> <p>At Harvard, the organisers had produced a crowd of around 50 other investigators from all over the world. Some I'd heard of, some I hadn't. A large and powerful woman with flashing eyes proved to be Yevgenia Albats, a take-no-prisoners freelance from Moscow. The small and wiry figure next to her at the buffet table was Yossi Melman, the brilliant security and intelligence specialist from the Hebrew-language Tel Aviv daily Ha'aretz. There was a gentle and polite environmental journalist from Japan and an impressively-bearded bruiser from Panama. </p> <p>This was a very unlikely collection of people to get together in one room, whose collective history of conflict with the authorities seemed likely to generate a truculence factor way off the scale. How on earth was anyone going to get them to agree about anything? </p> <p>Righteousness (even perhaps a touch of self-righteousness) is the non-profit ICIJ's keynote. Their mission, it transpired, was \"to conduct investigative projects across nation-state borders on the premise that an enlightened populace is an empowered populace\". </p> <p>In the interest of full disclosure they post a list of donors who contributed more than $5,000 on their website (no state or business funds are accepted). They list: The Carnegie Corporation of New York; Edith and Henry Everett; The John and Florence Newman Foundation; The Ford Foundation; Martha P. Newell; The Open Society Institute; The Ruben and Elisabeth Rausing Trust and Rockefeller Financial Services. </p> <p>Charles Lewis, the group's founder, and a former producer on CBS's well-respected investigative programme 60 Minutes, set out to strike an inspirational note in promoting his aims: \"For decades, people around the world have seen or heard news of global events simultaneously, from political and economic scandals to wars and natural disasters. But the commercial demands of the news industry have often meant that such information is brief, disjointed, and confusing.\" His grand scheme was that \"ICIJ and its cadre of international journalists investigate major global issues that affect us all\". </p> <p>The parent organisation, the Center for Public Integrity, is based in an office in Washington and has published dozens of domestic US investigative reports since its inception a decade ago, including The Buying of the President, a study of the intersection of money and politics in the American presidential campaign system. In 1996, the Center broke the Lincoln Bedroom scandal, in which big-money Democratic donors were invited to spend the night in the White House. </p> <p>Splicing together a heterogenous crowd of cantankerous foreign journalists and finding a way for them to work together was a much more tricky exercise. Some had staff jobs on their own local papers or TV, and wanted scoops for their own organi sations. Others were freelances, who needed sources of income rather than misty protestations of goodwill to the world.

      "bodyText": "Commentators tend to talk interminably about the way the world's politics and economics are being globalised. But investigative journalists, too, are now learning how they must go global. The revelations commencing today in the Guardian about cigarette giant BAT's involvement with smuggled products have emerged from an investigation carried out worldwide, via a novel journalistic organisation. The findings, now complete, are being released more or less simultaneously through sympathetic media outlets in Europe, Australia, North America and South America. The BAT story is the first fruit from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The ICIJ is a collection of people from around the world, under the aegis of a smallish Washington-based organisation, the Center for Public Integrity. The ICIJ communicates via the internet and a system of secure emails. Its existence demonstrates that it is possible to use the net not merely as a source of information, but as a means of bringing journalists together to work in a new way. We can do much more complicated things, and do them in more places, with more people, than ever before. With luck, this is the kind of creative thinking which is going to go a little way towards helping journalism catch up with the activities of mega-corporations and mega power blocs. I first encountered the ICIJ a little more than a year ago, when I got a letter from Washington inviting me to join a body I'd never heard of. They assured me rapidly that no payment of money was involved, but that it was a means of giving work to experienced investigative journalists. A free plane ticket to Boston followed, with an invitation to spend a weekend at Harvard university helping set the scheme up at its inaugural conference. Any doubts I had dissolved, when I realised my two fellow founder-members from the UK were extremely distinguished. One was Duncan Campbell - not the Guardian's Los Angeles correspondent, but the veteran Edinburgh-based investigator who has helped expose government intelligence agency eavesdropping over two decades, in the teeth of more injunctions and official secrets act prosecutions than most. And the other was Australian-born Phillip Knightley, whose fame rests on breaking open the Kim Philby scandal for the old pre-Murdoch Sunday Times, and whose recent autobiography A Hack's Progress is a classic. At Harvard, the organisers had produced a crowd of around 50 other investigators from all over the world. Some I'd heard of, some I hadn't. A large and powerful woman with flashing eyes proved to be Yevgenia Albats, a take-no-prisoners freelance from Moscow. The small and wiry figure next to her at the buffet table was Yossi Melman, the brilliant security and intelligence specialist from the Hebrew-language Tel Aviv daily Ha'aretz. There was a gentle and polite environmental journalist from Japan and an impressively-bearded bruiser from Panama. This was a very unlikely collection of people to get together in one room, whose collective history of conflict with the authorities seemed likely to generate a truculence factor way off the scale. How on earth was anyone going to get them to agree about anything? Righteousness (even perhaps a touch of self-righteousness) is the non-profit ICIJ's keynote. Their mission, it transpired, was \"to conduct investigative projects across nation-state borders on the premise that an enlightened populace is an empowered populace\". In the interest of full disclosure they post a list of donors who contributed more than $5,000 on their website (no state or business funds are accepted). They list: The Carnegie Corporation of New York; Edith and Henry Everett; The John and Florence Newman Foundation; The Ford Foundation; Martha P. Newell; The Open Society Institute; The Ruben and Elisabeth Rausing Trust and Rockefeller Financial Services. Charles Lewis, the group's founder, and a former producer on CBS's well-respected investigative programme 60 Minutes, set out to strike an inspirational note in promoting his aims: \"For decades, people around the world have seen or heard news of global events simultaneously, from political and economic scandals to wars and natural disasters. But the commercial demands of the news industry have often meant that such information is brief, disjointed, and confusing.\" His grand scheme was that \"ICIJ and its cadre of international journalists investigate major global issues that affect us all\". The parent organisation, the Center for Public Integrity, is based in an office in Washington and has published dozens of domestic US investigative reports since its inception a decade ago, including The Buying of the President, a study of the intersection of money and politics in the American presidential campaign system. In 1996, the Center broke the Lincoln Bedroom scandal, in which big-money Democratic donors were invited to spend the night in the White House. Splicing together a heterogenous crowd of cantankerous foreign journalists and finding a way for them to work together was a much more tricky exercise. Some had staff jobs on their own local papers or TV, and wanted scoops for their own organi sations. Others were freelances, who needed sources of income rather than misty protestations of goodwill to the world. Journalistic stances and standards varied wildly. Nonetheless, by the time of the second ICIJ international conference - at Stanford university last November - a big global investigation had finally got under way rather secretively. Maud Beelman, a veteran foreign correspondent for Associated Press, had taken over as ICIJ director. And she heard via the World Health Organisation and the tight-knit world of anti-tobacco campaigners of an astonishing cache of documents that might be available in England, at a depository in Guildford. The global tobacco multinational, BAT, had settled a US health suit brought by the state of Minnesota, on condition that they made their internal company files available to researchers for a period of 10 years. Dismayed, BAT had persuaded a judge to allow access only via an archive near their headquarters in Surrey. And they did not help inquirers understand what their contents might signify. But these files covered their operations in virtually every country on the globe. With starter funds from a donor foundation, Beelman recruited Duncan Campbell in Britain. \"We had to be granted a place at their Guildford archive,\" Campbell says: \"BAT lawyers constantly introduced rules. They would say there were a maxi mum of six places available. Or only one organisation at a time was allowed in. Then, suddenly, all the available places were booked up for weeks ahead. The staff there were clearly told to be polite but everything was as difficult as it could be.\" At one point, tobacco campaigners had to enlist the original Minnesota state lawyers to threaten BAT with a return to court, and a revocation of their special dispensation to set up a depository out of US jurisdiction. BAT grudgingly complied. A lengthy process resumed of scanning BAT indexes, ordering up potentially interesting files, and trying to interpret their contents with help from ICIJ members , particularly in Latin America and south-east Asia. Only last week, BAT's chairman Martin Broughton rather scornfully told a Commons health committee that the Guildford depository had been a waste of time, and health campaigners had failed to discover anything unsavoury. This was a testament to ICIJ's good security at least. At the time he spoke, finishing touches were being put to a devastating report.

The pursuit of the BAT story so far has married investigative skills with global technology in an interesting way. And something less tangible but perhaps even more romantic has been nourished as well - a worldwide optimism about new possibilities for chasing the truth.

      "body": "<p>It starts like this. An assistant comes into your office - where you are editing a story about the world's biggest bar - and announces, with an air of familiarity, that \"Todd\" from Burning Owl Television is on the phone wanting to discuss \"the treatment\" he sent you for the documentary he wants to make. You reach down into the file marked \"Television\", which is full of crisp white letters from producers hoping to document your daily grind, or turn your magazine into a TV show, and begin to read. </p> <p>The letter is on good-quality paper with a razor-sharp fold and appears beneath the image of a wise old owl with its arse ablaze. As a logo, it is quite startling and suggests something more anarchic than low-paid voyeurism. Then you notice that just to the owl's side is an embossed camera, slightly raised from the page, capturing the hot-bird action. Todd's \"idea\" is to follow the editor and his editorial team for a few months to allow the public to see exactly what goes on inside the offices of your \"cutting edge\" magazine. He has written the request with so much conviction that he might genuinely think that no one has ever suggested such a venture before and that you'll be gagging for him to come in immediately and stick his big lens up your conference table. </p> <p>Confident and to the point, the missive suggests Channel 4 and BBC2 are both keen to screen, and his talent is certified by the brief mention of the fact that Todd and Burning Owl were the makers of Zoo Keeper. This was the previous week's hilarious look at how men in blue overalls clean up elephant dung, argue about low overtime rates and extract lollipop sticks from the jaws of snakes. You remember smirking at the trailer for Zoo Keeper and then you remind yourself that you thought the programme looked interesting because you would be watching not participating in it. </p> <p>You think for a moment that you might come across as a TV natural like John Harvey-Jones, Chris Evans, or one of the many Soho chefs. But you are snapped out of your reverie by Todd's telephone inquiry, which you politely turn down. </p> <p>At least that's the way it's supposed to be. Only no one told Sally O'Sullivan. At one point during last Monday's episode of Trouble Between The Covers - BBC2's documentary annihilation of the launch of her publishing company Cabal Communications - my wife looked at me with what I can only describe as mortgage fear. She wrongly assumed that all magazine companies are like this. Her look was so accusing - as if to say, \"Is this what goes on in your industry? Is this what's going to happen to you?\" - that I had to reassure her I would do my best to make my own fledgling media company a success without the need to offer it up as entertainment. </p> <p>And that is what Cabal has become. We had started off thinking the show was funny, became slowly dismayed to see an editor getting his copy checked by a major London gangster, and then were horrified when the head of the company began scrabbling around on the floor changing carpet tiles to impress a potential contract customer. </p> <p>To the magazine industry, Trouble Between The Covers is enthralling. Rather like seeing something wounded or dying - you don't really want to watch it but you can't quite look away. The words \"worst case scenario\" and \"why?\" spring to mind.

      "bodyText": "It starts like this. An assistant comes into your office - where you are editing a story about the world's biggest bar - and announces, with an air of familiarity, that \"Todd\" from Burning Owl Television is on the phone wanting to discuss \"the treatment\" he sent you for the documentary he wants to make. You reach down into the file marked \"Television\", which is full of crisp white letters from producers hoping to document your daily grind, or turn your magazine into a TV show, and begin to read. The letter is on good-quality paper with a razor-sharp fold and appears beneath the image of a wise old owl with its arse ablaze. As a logo, it is quite startling and suggests something more anarchic than low-paid voyeurism. Then you notice that just to the owl's side is an embossed camera, slightly raised from the page, capturing the hot-bird action. Todd's \"idea\" is to follow the editor and his editorial team for a few months to allow the public to see exactly what goes on inside the offices of your \"cutting edge\" magazine. He has written the request with so much conviction that he might genuinely think that no one has ever suggested such a venture before and that you'll be gagging for him to come in immediately and stick his big lens up your conference table. Confident and to the point, the missive suggests Channel 4 and BBC2 are both keen to screen, and his talent is certified by the brief mention of the fact that Todd and Burning Owl were the makers of Zoo Keeper. This was the previous week's hilarious look at how men in blue overalls clean up elephant dung, argue about low overtime rates and extract lollipop sticks from the jaws of snakes. You remember smirking at the trailer for Zoo Keeper and then you remind yourself that you thought the programme looked interesting because you would be watching not participating in it. You think for a moment that you might come across as a TV natural like John Harvey-Jones, Chris Evans, or one of the many Soho chefs. But you are snapped out of your reverie by Todd's telephone inquiry, which you politely turn down. At least that's the way it's supposed to be. Only no one told Sally O'Sullivan. At one point during last Monday's episode of Trouble Between The Covers - BBC2's documentary annihilation of the launch of her publishing company Cabal Communications - my wife looked at me with what I can only describe as mortgage fear. She wrongly assumed that all magazine companies are like this. Her look was so accusing - as if to say, \"Is this what goes on in your industry? Is this what's going to happen to you?\" - that I had to reassure her I would do my best to make my own fledgling media company a success without the need to offer it up as entertainment. And that is what Cabal has become. We had started off thinking the show was funny, became slowly dismayed to see an editor getting his copy checked by a major London gangster, and then were horrified when the head of the company began scrabbling around on the floor changing carpet tiles to impress a potential contract customer. To the magazine industry, Trouble Between The Covers is enthralling. Rather like seeing something wounded or dying - you don't really want to watch it but you can't quite look away. The words \"worst case scenario\" and \"why?\" spring to mind. Whenever I talk to a publisher or an advertiser, a journalist or a distributor, they all pass comment, keen to find out if it will get better or worse, and not too sure which they want. The stars of the show are Piers Hernu, the editor of junior lads' mag Front, and his boss, the aforementioned Sally O'Sullivan. Bizarrely, their personality traits suggest that each should be doing the other's job. Piers is keen, thoughtful, eager to try things, quick to see the error of his ways and cautious about trying too hard to suck up to advertisers. Sally, meanwhile, is having the time of her life throwing parties and executing daring plans and is frequently to be seen cuddling a wine glass. To be honest, the things that have been going wrong - interview tapes fail to record, pitches fail - happen every day in a magazine company, but it's all being captured on film and seems all the more spectacular because the series began with grand talk of empires, legends and profit. The most striking image so far came at the end of the first episode when O'Sullivan was seen shrieking in the street in what sounded like inebriated Italian, insisting that staff members must return to the launch party. Although the two chief executives I have worked for, Mike Matthews at IPC and Jonathan Newhouse at Cond\u00e9 Nast, both have a sense of humour, I cannot envisage either of them ever behaving like that. I admit that I have carried on in far worse fashion, but never as a chief executive. It is my greatest hope that the series improves matters for the struggling company: indeed O'Sullivan has already pointed out that newsstand sales are up because of the publicity. I'd like to think that Piers, the only man to have been sacked from Loaded for being unpopular (in my time that was the criteria for being hired), will be offered a Channel 5 dating game to host.

      "body": "<p>The members of parliament who fall prey to the pranks of Mark Thomas have slowly become aware - as his Channel 4 series has evolved over the past four years - that they are not simply dealing with the Chumbawamba of British comedy. This is not a tub-thumping middle-class man in a silly suit dousing the working class John Prescott in the name of direct action. A fact that was confirmed last week when the lines between stand-up comedy and investigative journalism became blurred, with Thomas emerging as the point where a John Pilger-like polemic and Roger Cook-like tactics converge in a Donald MacIntyre-like body. </p> <p>On Wednesday morning the Guardian sparked one of the biggest stories of the week when it led with a piece headlined \"Whitehall leak reveals ethics row\". It was a story gained out of collaboration between this newspaper and Channel 4, a missile at the heart of the heated debate about ethical foreign policy. Follow-ups led news bulletins and leader columns. </p> <p>But for media watchers, the story - about whether environmental considerations should underpin British export agreements - had one fascinating line: \"Four departments are at the centre of the Whitehall battle, revealed in documents to be shown on tomorrow night's Mark Thomas Product.\" Not Panorama, or Dispatches or Newsnight. No, on a show fronted by a comedian who decided that there was a lot more fun to be had confronting people with something to hide than making up jokes. Comic as journalist as entertainer. </p> <p>Dangerous? Or simply more proof that consumers of news are, increasingly, demanding presentation that is out of the ordinary. </p> <p>In the offices of Vera Productions - the company behind the Mark Thomas Product - Thomas himself is, of course, joyous that the story made such an impact. However, he is quick to point out that he is not in the business of breaking exclusives, but in working for the good of the story: \"You either regard information as a right, or as a commodity. And if you regard it as a commodity, we don't want to play.\" </p> <p>This latest development does imply that the guerrilla and Gotcha! tactics he employs to expose absurdities in government legislation, and unveil the more covert uses of taxpayers' money, is granting him access to information that would have previously been pounced on by orthodox current affairs series. But does Thomas do anything more than, as Chris Morris once said, bully receptionists? True, Thomas has sometimes lumbered the girl that works the switchboard for \u00a313,000 a year with the crimes of capitalism, because her boss won't take a call. A case in point being the show on the Millennium Dome. </p> <p>But for the most part, Thomas's strike-rate has proved impressive, from working to reform a scheme enabling the wealthy to avoid inheritance tax on works of art, to revelations that emerged when Thomas and his team posed as a PR company at an arms fair. The subterfuge resulted in the Indonesian defence attache admitting that equipment made in Britain had been used to squash dissension in East Timor. </p> <p>\"That programme was more effective than the John Pilger one about East Timor,\" says Jeff Anderson, editor of Tonight with Trevor McDonald, and previously World in Action. \"By using humour and pranks, Mark Thomas made a serious subject accessible to a 16- to 30-year-old audience.\" </p> <p>\"I like the idea of finding a story and not going away,\" says Thomas. The genesis of last week's disclosures was in a programme in October, revealing how directors advising the government on the underwriting of billions of pounds for arms exports had omitted to mention their own interests. </p> <p>The missionary zeal that Thomas brings to his efforts to re-enfranchise the Channel 4 viewer could be genetic. His great-grandfather was a Baptist preacher, and his father a lay preacher in his native south London. The style is part fundamentalist, part flypitcher. He can condense complex issues, even though the soundbite on his own political standpoint is simplistic: \"Philosophically, I describe myself as an anarchist.\" </p> <p>Evangelical is the word he uses to describe his favoured journalists. The kind that, day in, day out, come out fighting in the red corner. But there is \"a very strange deal that some journalists make. It is as though they exchange criticism for closeness and accessibility. There are some who have had the Labour party bullying them, attempting to manipulate them. And sometimes the manipulation is wilfully acquiesced in. They will do it to be at the heart of things. Close to the power.\" In the past, the comedian was contacted by Robin Cook's office, with a view to writing gags. \"It doesn't appeal to me. So what if twice a year I'd get invited to drinks at the Foreign Office?\" </p> <p>His series has evolved into a current affairs programme just as the genre has lost weight. It came into being as a Situationist prank. These things happen. Keith Allen's career emerged from a Situationist stunt, as did that of Malcolm McLaren. The aim of the series was to reveal to the public facets of politicians to which they would not usually be privy. </p> <p>Gradually, it has formed into a genre of its own: factual comedy. The emphasis is now on rigorous research. For the current run, the word \"comedy\" was ditched from the title, and the stunts have taken a backseat to the reporting. </p> <p>\"We're very happy being this highbrow,\" says Thomas. \"We regard ourselves as dumbing-up while everyone else is accused of dumbing-down.\" </p> <p>\"I think that Mark's line of investigation is as capable as that of any investigative journalist,\" says David Lloyd, Channel 4's head of news and current affairs. \"This makes him unusual. But I don't think we're about to see a lot of comedy investigators.\" </p> <p>And yet there is, elsewhere, a seasoning of politics seeping into the careers of comedians. Dom Joly of Trigger Happy TV was the merry prankster caught on camera during Neil Hamilton's recent court appearance. When BBC2 last year commissioned a fin de si\u00e8cle series on crime, drugs and class, it was not Jeremy Paxman or Andrew Neil they called, but Mark Lamarr. Thomas's venture has had an impact on other series. \"When we were putting together Tonight,\" recalls Anderson, \"I realised we could learn a lot from the style of Mark Thomas and Michael Moore. We decided to attempt to bring an irreverent slant to things.\" </p> <p>A charge levelled at Thomas, since the comedy has decreased, is that he has become sanctimonious and tells people what to think. But this is in keeping with a tradition of current affairs television, whereby reports came with the chaser of an opinion - witness the 60s broadcasters such as Alan Whicker, James Cameron and Fyfe Robertson. And in the 70s, anyone with a pad and a biro was looking for a Watergate. </p> <p>Anderson believes that there was a loss of nerve in current affairs in the 80s. It became too balanced - but \"in the last couple of years the committed reporter has begun to reappear\". Thomas says there are too few good editors. \"Who decides what constitutes a news story? Who decides what the agenda is? There's a rush to this ground where everyone has a consensual opinion on things.\" </p> <p>The opinion on The Mark Thomas Product at Channel 4 is unclear. In some ways he fits the bill as the cheeky, punky chappie who thumbs his nose at the TV establishment, like the comic cracking jokes at the expense at those in the royal box. They love it, because, ultimately, it's their finger on the button. For now, the show stays put; in the US, Michael Moore's direct-action mini-documentaries have upset sponsors and been shunned by networks. </p> <p>As for Thomas himself, a hell of lot of people now have the measure of the man. Members of the police force are reported to be fans of the show. He remains the nemesis of Jack Straw (whom he tricked in a cannabis stunt) and says the Labour party won't talk to him. Recently, he managed to get within five steps of Tony Blair before being whisked away. </p> <p>\"There's a limit to the range of subjects you can cover with comedy in current affairs,\" says Panorama's editor, Peter Horrocks. \"There's a limit to what you can find out. MPs just won't answer the question. They won't demean themselves. When we did a programme last year called The Blair Mayor Project, we unravelled a story that wouldn't have been helped by the kind of tricks Mark Thomas uses. That's not to say that laughs can't be useful.\" </p> <p>The Mark Thomas Product is about the pursuit of access, whether to information or to those with access to that information. But what happens once you get beyond the comedy and the thrill of the chase? Some time before embarking on a stand-up career, Thomas, as a student, broke through a police line protecting a bus full of strike-breakers during the miners' dispute. </p> <p>He stood there, embarrassed, uncertain what to do but shout \"Scab!\" and run back to the pack. What would happen now if he broke through the police line, or beyond the minders, or reached the minister? What if, when Byers was chased and harangued in last week's show, instead of running, piling into the car and disappearing, he had stopped and said \"let's talk\". Would he go for the joke or go for the jugular? </p> <p>\"That's fine. That's fine,\" Thomas says. \"Because we know that subject backwards. I know the conditions are bullshit. I know the Turkish authorities have not signed up for the conditions. I know that Blair got a local firm in. I know they have not got an international monitoring agreement. I know the Turkish authorities are fucked off. It's not that we've not got the facts. Once we're through the line - we're armed.\"</p> <p> The Mark Thomas Product is on Channel 4 on Thursdays at 11.05pm</p>",

What if, when Byers was chased and harangued in last week's show, instead of running, piling into the car and disappearing, he had stopped and said \"let's talk\". Would he go for the joke or go for the jugular? \"That's fine. That's fine,\" Thomas says. \"Because we know that subject backwards. I know the conditions are bullshit. I know the Turkish authorities have not signed up for the conditions. I know that Blair got a local firm in. I know they have not got an international monitoring agreement. I know the Turkish authorities are fucked off. It's not that we've not got the facts. Once we're through the line - we're armed.\" The Mark Thomas Product is on Channel 4 on Thursdays at 11.05pm",

      "body": "<p>On the comfy sofas of Breakfast with Frost yesterday morning, Greg Dyke gave an account of himself. Yes, the governors did know about all his share dealings before they gave him the job. No, maybe it hadn't been the best idea to try to hold onto \u00a36m of Granada shares even though he was taking over as director general early. And, yes, in fact he would describe it as a \"mistake\". </p> <p>But then came the intriguing part. Dyke questioned the veracity of quotes in the press from one governor supposedly angered by the share dealing row. Was that a true quote, Dyke asked. \"I doubt it.\" </p> <p>Dyke said that no governors had spoken either to him or the chairman of the BBC, Sir Christopher Bland, about their concerns over his private business dealings. The fact that they hadn't says a lot about the way the BBC is governed. </p> <p>The key task of the BBC's governors is to appoint a director general. So there should be absolutely no surprise that their judgment is now being questioned. Even if you don't share the view of the Daily Mail - which spat \"Have there ever been such unimpressive governors of the BBC?\" - there is now a consensus that the system is imperfect, and creating an all-too-visible trail of banana skins. </p> <p>Even as they met for their monthly meeting last Thursday, controversy stirred at their supper table, shared by Will Wyatt, former chief executive of BBC Broadcast, the second most powerful man in the BBC until he retired in December. </p> <p>He wrote an open letter to Dyke in the London Evening Standard last week which is now reverberating around the BBC's executive suites: \"The business of your Granada shares shows that you have not yet quite got the point. The BBC is different.\" </p> <p>Wyatt, perhaps unintentionally, also went on in his Standard article to expose the way the BBC trains new governors so that their interests gradually become indistinguishable from the institution. </p> <p>\"Over the years I have watched the arrival from the commercial sector of governors who do know that the BBC is special but begin by coming up with all kinds of bright ideas which are utterly counter to what the BBC is for. Most quickly learn.\" </p> <p>The bigger point raised by all this is whether the 12-strong governors - who appointed Dyke despite the furore over his \u00a355,000 Labour donations and who are required to act as custodians of the national interest - have got it as well? </p> <p>As is well known, Dyke was appointed on a split vote. He was the choice of Sir Christopher Bland right from the start. That is part of the problem. In the current system, the chairman of the BBC wields huge power. Bland's instinct, first over the Granada shares, then over Dyke's money in private property deals revealed last week, was to tough things out. When Dyke finally decided to sell his Granada shares it looked as if media pressure rather than wise counsel from the governors had forced his hand. </p> <p>Even after Dyke had sold his \u00a36m of shares and then been reminded of his \"forgotten\" \u00a3175,000 Pearson holding, another governor, weary of the huge media interest, insisted to me last week that the whole fuss had been blown up by the Sunday Times. Many would say that shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation. </p> <p>These are not ordinary times. The BBC is being made to sweat, before hearing details of the government decision on an increase in its income either through a digital supplement or an across-the-board increase. Can a rise, paid for by ordinary people, be announced when its governance looks, at best, questionable? </p> <p>Chris Smith, the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, currently at the centre of a fierce round of inter-departmental politicking over the future funding of the BBC, was horrified at the existence of the Granada share holding. </p> <p>Smith, who is a firm believer in public service broadcasting and anxious not to undermine the new director general, cannot avoid the question: Are the governors on the ball? </p> <p>Now this is a key element bubbling through the document that kicked the licence fee debate off last year - the Davies Committee report. It described the governors as \"problematic\" and said that the future lay with \"improved accountability through a modernised system of governance\". </p> <p>The report continues: \"On the one hand they are supposed to set the Corporation's general direction under the charter, to be the main instrument by which it is rendered accountable. On the other hand they are often regarded very much as part of the management of the corporation. Governors are serviced by a secretariat which is part of the staff of the BBC and which therefore has to reconcile dual loyalty to its management and the governors. </p> <p>\"This is in sharp contrast to the arrangements that apply in commercial television companies. We do have a sense that the present situation is neither satisfactory nor defensible.\" </p> <p>As an interim measure Davies said that the National Audit Office should mount periodic examinations of the BBC's books, as it does with the directly funded World Service, something stoutly resisted by the BBC. </p> <p>Until now the BBC has been able to rely on a mix of mild reform, inertia, public support, and a respect for years of tradition to protect its constitution, something even Margaret Thatcher did not dare to tackle head on. But with a government finally prepared to square up to even such big vested interests as the hereditary peers it may be different this time. </p> <p>In 1992 a government consultation paper on the BBC asked: \"Should changes be made in the functions of the governors and the BBC board of management? Should there be a public service broadcasting council, either to regulate the BBC or promote public service broadcasting across the board in the BBC and other services?\" As ever, nothing of substance happened. </p> <p>The governors themselves, as the former governor of Northern Ireland, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, said in a rare paper on the BBC four years ago, have to cope with a huge amount of information, but without an office themselves, unlike the chairman. </p> <p>And they are 12 individuals with their respective \"tastes, interests and prejudices\", often with little in common and far removed from popular audiences. </p> <p>There has been a time-honoured tradition to appoint a trade unionist, a commercial banker, an ex-foreign office mandarin or diplomat, and, most damagingly, a handful of political placemen and women. </p> <p>Where the rules have been changed, there has been a tendency to concentrate power in the chairman's hands. It really took off with Lord (Marmaduke) Hussey, chairman between 1986-1995, who was deliberately appointed to \"sort out\" the BBC. He sacked the director general, Alasdair Milne, in 1987 and thus broke the tradition of internally promoted director generals, imbued with the public service ethos. Hussey was the first chairman to be given a second term in office. </p> <p>This precedent enhanced the chairman's power, and allowed him to bulldoze John Birt with his savage programme of organisational change into the top job - without open competition. </p> <p>Sir Christopher Bland, his successor and another Conservative appointee, had his chairmanship also extended for a second term, to 2003. </p> <p>As for the tradition of the governors not being executives, well Hussey and Bland worked and work about four days a week and occupy a large office with a secretary in Broadcasting House. BBC executives point out that that seems pretty full-time. </p> <p>Charles Wheeler, the distinguished BBC correspondent, pointed out in last week's Radio 4 debate on Birt's legacy that if the BBC is run through a cosy relationship between chairman and director general, there are clear dangers. </p> <p>In the Bland-Dyke era the combination seems to denote a tolerance for private business deals, all part of both men's multi-millionaire status. </p> <p>A senior figure in the Royal Television Society believes the problem goes beyond the purely financial transparency driving Davies. </p> <p>\"Bland [over the Dyke share issue] failed to recognise he needed to be scrupulous. No permanent secretary in the civil service would be allowed to hold a large stake in a commercial company like that. \"This isn't about not knowing about broadcasting. It's about their moral judgment.\" </p> <p>The result of the governor's inability to act, he concludes sadly, is that Dyke is saddled \"with the perception that he is greedy\". </p> <p>Of course, it is not all one way traffic. The BBC's deputy chairwoman, Baroness Young, is a tough operator who is thought to have insisted 14 months ago that Jenny Abramsky became the new director of radio. She is a counter to the strength of Bland but again has too low a public profile. </p> <p>Richard Eyre, the ex-chief executive of the ITV Network and former candidate for the director general's post, says that although ITV's stance in the licence fee debate has been that the BBC is basically ungoverned because of the close relationship between governors and BBC managers, \"my brush showed they were no patsies\". </p> <p>Eyre, who was interviewed by the governors for the DG post, said: \"They are highly critical of the BBC, pushing it to very high standards. They form a very high calibre board. These are not cosy people.\" </p> <p>There have been efforts to change, to inject elements of accountability by dealing direct with the public, but it's not been cutting edge stuff. The BBC's dreadful See For Yourself annual programmes of 1987 to 1989 gave way eventually to the grandiose and often vacuous Statement of Promises of the past four years. Flawed, as the National Consumer Council noted, because the promises are \"constructed by the BBC, monitored by the governors\". </p> <p>True, the BBC chairman and director general go before the select committee to account for themselves once a year. There are also more structured meetings with the secretary of state. </p> <p>But the self-serving nature of so many BBC consultations - typically \"licence fee payers say 'yes' to proposals for new BBC services\" - have riled everyone outside the BBC, including government ministers. </p> <p>So, three options remain. In the short term the government could insist that the National Audit Office has a scrutinising role, and amend the charter accordingly. </p> <p>Longer term, the conservative move would be to strengthen the BBC governors, and bolster their independence with their own secretariat. But in the forthcoming review of regulation ordered by Smith, there could be wider support for an external regulator, which would set standards against agreed criteria for public service broadcasting and key networks - to which the governors would be accountable. </p> <p>The interesting thing is that a big factor in saving the BBC from big change during the 80s was its popularity, the fact that the audience had not deserted it. </p> <p>If Dyke manages to inspire programme makers to new heights this might be an escape route yet.

Obviously a metaphor for television news at BBC White City. And the boss? Well, we can only speculate, but John Birt must be glad he's leaving. </p> <p>Anyway, on to the text. And what a text it is. \"A body was propped between the frame of the door,\" Docherty tells the reader. \"A metal door had been driven through the rib cage and the corpse was wedged upright. A noose around the neck was connected to a hook on the lintel. The face underneath was bashed in and the tongue cut out. Both wrists had been slashed and the blood spilled down the expensively cut cotton trousers and dried hard. The carcass was beginning to smell and the cloud of flies that covered the wounds rose as one when Fernandez moved the body.\" </p> <p>I'd like to run the extract about the woman on the top floor of the bus which is equally bloody, but am aware that Media Guardian holds firm family values. Ah well, maybe more next week . . . </p> <p>\u0095 Sir Christopher Bland, beleaguered chairman of the BBC, was looking unusually tense at last Thursday's Royal Television Society dinner in Mayfair, saluting the retirement of Will Wyatt, chief executive of BBC Broadcast. </p> <p>Wyatt described witnessing a governors' meeting chaired by Bland's predecessor Marmaduke Hussey. He was seeking consensus on a hot policy issue. A governor passed Wyatt a folded note which he thought must pertain to the complicated point under debate. It read: \"Do we check when people ring in and say they're vicars? I heard a so-called vicar (on a phone in) standing up for lesbians - I could hardly believe my ears.\" </p> <p>And warm applause for Esther Rantzen who, in her 20-minute tribute to Wyatt, managed to mention the man twice before going on to her own achievements in mind-numbingly boring detail. </p> <p>\u0095 Another one somewhat obsessed with herself is Deborah Ross, the Independent's chief interviewer. In the first three paragraphs of her interview with Sarah Lancashire, she uses the word \"I\" 21 times. Presumably, clever Independent research has discovered the readers are more interested in Ross than they are in the star she is talking to. No wonder their circulation is so robust. </p> <p>\u0095 Robot Wars, the mad Friday night show for boys large and small, is about to spawn a grown-up version. BBC2 has quietly ordered up six episodes of Techno Games, starting in March, in which crazed mechanics, sorry ordinary blokes, compete to make robots which then enter a mad series of competitions, from robot dancing and robot athletics to launching rockets! </p> <p>Meanwhile, Robot Wars, thrashing TFI Friday's Chris Evans, and about to air on America's PBS channel, is being awarded its own BBC monthly magazine with Sir Killalot, the house robot, as pin-up. As a top children's programme, it's ripe for a transfer to BBC1 in the footsteps of Changing Rooms and Ground Force. Except that's no way to treat a cult. </p> <p>\u0095 Plans have been hastily devised to get BBC1's Castaways on air more regularly. The original proposal was to leave the softies alone with the cameras on Taransay for a year of social experimentation, before screening any more reports. But the wrap-up programme last week, showing the outbreak of flu and misery, beat ITV and gained a 7.7m audience, some 35% of viewers. Controller Peter Salmon is salivating with delight. The BBC has been inundated with calls for more sightings of Tatler picture editor Ben Fogle. It may well produce monthly instalments. </p> <p>\u0095 And of course we couldn't end this week without mentioning that the new home editor of the Times, Michael Gove, was the man who wrote in his biography of Michael Portillo: \"While few of Portillo's contemporaries would describe him as a model undergraduate, none recalls anything more embarrassing than drunkenness or a taste for practical jokes.\" Of course, Portillo later revealed to the, erm, Times that he had had \"homosexual experiences\" during university. Times hacks are already calling big-brains Gove \"the rottweiler\".</p> <p>You can email Maggie Brown at maggiebrown.media@btinternet.com</p>",

The carcass was beginning to smell and the cloud of flies that covered the wounds rose as one when Fernandez moved the body.\" I'd like to run the extract about the woman on the top floor of the bus which is equally bloody, but am aware that Media Guardian holds firm family values. Ah well, maybe more next week . . . \u0095 Sir Christopher Bland, beleaguered chairman of the BBC, was looking unusually tense at last Thursday's Royal Television Society dinner in Mayfair, saluting the retirement of Will Wyatt, chief executive of BBC Broadcast. Wyatt described witnessing a governors' meeting chaired by Bland's predecessor Marmaduke Hussey. He was seeking consensus on a hot policy issue. A governor passed Wyatt a folded note which he thought must pertain to the complicated point under debate. It read: \"Do we check when people ring in and say they're vicars? I heard a so-called vicar (on a phone in) standing up for lesbians - I could hardly believe my ears.\" And warm applause for Esther Rantzen who, in her 20-minute tribute to Wyatt, managed to mention the man twice before going on to her own achievements in mind-numbingly boring detail. \u0095 Another one somewhat obsessed with herself is Deborah Ross, the Independent's chief interviewer. In the first three paragraphs of her interview with Sarah Lancashire, she uses the word \"I\" 21 times. Presumably, clever Independent research has discovered the readers are more interested in Ross than they are in the star she is talking to. No wonder their circulation is so robust. \u0095 Robot Wars, the mad Friday night show for boys large and small, is about to spawn a grown-up version. BBC2 has quietly ordered up six episodes of Techno Games, starting in March, in which crazed mechanics, sorry ordinary blokes, compete to make robots which then enter a mad series of competitions, from robot dancing and robot athletics to launching rockets! Meanwhile, Robot Wars, thrashing TFI Friday's Chris Evans, and about to air on America's PBS channel, is being awarded its own BBC monthly magazine with Sir Killalot, the house robot, as pin-up. As a top children's programme, it's ripe for a transfer to BBC1 in the footsteps of Changing Rooms and Ground Force. Except that's no way to treat a cult. \u0095 Plans have been hastily devised to get BBC1's Castaways on air more regularly. The original proposal was to leave the softies alone with the cameras on Taransay for a year of social experimentation, before screening any more reports. But the wrap-up programme last week, showing the outbreak of flu and misery, beat ITV and gained a 7.7m audience, some 35% of viewers. Controller Peter Salmon is salivating with delight. The BBC has been inundated with calls for more sightings of Tatler picture editor Ben Fogle. It may well produce monthly instalments. \u0095 And of course we couldn't end this week without mentioning that the new home editor of the Times, Michael Gove, was the man who wrote in his biography of Michael Portillo: \"While few of Portillo's contemporaries would describe him as a model undergraduate, none recalls anything more embarrassing than drunkenness or a taste for practical jokes.\" Of course, Portillo later revealed to the, erm, Times that he had had \"homosexual experiences\" during university. Times hacks are already calling big-brains Gove \"the rottweiler\". You can email Maggie Brown at maggiebrown.media@btinternet.com",

Edgy animation in the mould of The Simpsons with Break-Up Girl, an interactive teen show called Trackers, and an innovative women's sports programme are promised. The key figure will be one of Oprah's partners - Geraldine Laybourne, a tough executive whose ability to create the kind of street-smart brand she developed with the kids' channel Nickelodeon will be vital. But in the end for an unforgiving, choice-rich audience the programmes just have to be good. </p> <p>Already, America has a successful women's cable channel in Lifetime, with more than 75m subscribers. Although laughingly dubbed Wifetime because of its soft, middle-aged tone, it dominates the market and has begun to counteract the arrival of Oxygen with younger programmes. </p> <p>Like all media start-ups, Oxygen will be short of breath. All the programmes will be brand new, without repeats, and inevitably some will fail. Yet at $400m the programme budget will be significantly higher than other new cable channels. </p> <p>However, much of the cash comes from such usual male media suspects as Microsoft founder Paul Allen and the ubiquitous AOL, as well as from Oprah's own company Harpo. Their most recent investor, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's leading luxury goods brand, contrasts sharply with the grass-roots, empowering tone of Oxygen's mission statement. </p> <p>Delegates at the Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival would also be cautious about how different Oxygen will really be. Comedy producer Caryn Mandabach, an Oxygen partner, gave last year's Worldview lecture and beforehand she said, \"Women will love it but perhaps the men ought to leave. . . men will think it's an attack.\" In fact, her occasionally funny but largely vacuous speech had both sexes in the audience squirming. As one delegate put it, \"I was embarrassed to be a woman. I wanted to hide behind my chair.\" Closer inspection of Oxygen's schedules are not much more encouraging.

Back then I could never have imagined that I would end up embroiled in a British political issue, or that one of my children's books would become a weapon in a war over the teaching of sexuality in schools. </p> <p>I loved those few days in London. I travelled with a friend, and we saw all the sights. We walked by the Thames, crossed the bridges, went shopping on Carnaby Steet and Kings Road for fancy clothes you could only dream about back in Copenhagen.We went to the theatre, and saw wonderful performances with a humour and an attitude to life that felt very close to the Danish way of thinking. A friend took us to a punk concert and we felt like two old aunties from the country. As we made our way home afterwards we agreed that Britain was miles ahead of Denmark. </p> <p>But my next encounter with this promised land was very different. It came in 1983 when I was overwhelmed by journalists from different British papers who all hoped to get a story about how badly life had turned out for the little family in my book, Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin. They were very disappointed to discover that it was a fictional story, that the real people who inspired it hadn't fallen victim to any unmentionable disease - and, not least, that I was straight. When they concluded there were no scandals to be found, they lost interest and I didn't have any contact with the British press until recently when my Jenny book was sucked once again into the argument over section 28. </p> <p>My first book was published in 1977 and I have been writing children's books ever since. The entertainment value has always been important to me, but it seems just as important to give children relevant stories and, in a gentle way, to help them understand themselves and the society they live in. I believe that a good children's book has a built-in tiny bit of wisdom - like the old fairytales. As mother, father, teacher or author we should give our children stories that give them all the time in the world to remain in, and enjoy, their childhood. But we are also responsible for giving them stories that gently open their minds and prepare them for meeting the world as adults - a world in which adults are no longer available to solve the children's problems with a hug and a kiss. </p> <p>This is the foundation of all my books. I wrote Jenny Lives with Eric and Martin back in 1981 because I became aware of the problems which some children face when meeting family groupings different from the ones they are familiar with, ie mum and dad, possibly mum and dad divorced, maybe a step-parent. It's not possible to go through life without meeting people living in different ways, and they shouldn't come as a shock to anybody. </p> <p> W hile researching for the book I became aware that there are a lot of children in Denmark living with a homosexual father or mother, and that there was a need for a book for these children to identify with. So I wrote this everyday story about Jenny living with her father - and stepfather. And it was absolutely shocking to see the book vilified as homosexual propaganda in the British press back in 1983 and (to a lesser degree) again now. I feel angry that my intentions in writing this book - namely to give children a little more knowledge about the world - have been twisted by grown-up people who chose to use it as a weapon in a political battle. It has also been depressing to see my own words from interviews misrepresented to fit this or that position. </p> <p>For what it's worth, I don't personally think homosexuality (or any other subject) should be aggressively promoted in schools, but I do think it should be talked about in an informative, unsensational, way. One way of doing that is by making books like mine available to children in schools and libraries - as is done in Denmark - and by letting teachers and parents be prepared to answer questions without unnecessary drama.</p>",

      "bodyText": "General Augusto Pinochet is a step closer to flying home to Chile after Belgium and six human rights groups today lost their high court action to force a judicial review. They had challenged home secretary Jack Straw to reveal the contents of the medical tests that left him 'minded' not to extradite the former Chilean dictator to face trial in Spain . Justice Maurice Kay said the report should not be disclosed and that the application must consequently be refused. The judge added that Mr Straw had already obtained an impartial medical assessment of Pinochet by an internationally distinguished team of clinicians. The call for a fresh assessment was inappropriate, he said. Belgium and human rights groups including Amnesty International said the secrecy over the report was depriving them of a chance to make informed and \"meaningful\" representations to Mr Straw, or possibly challenge him in the courts. Mr Straw recently announced his wish to end, on compassionate grounds, the costly and long-running extradition proceedings against the 84-year-old general. A Chilean Air Force Boeing 707 jet is waiting on the tarmac at RAF Brize Norton, Oxon, ready to take Pinochet home. The general may still have to wait however, as today's application for judicial review could yet be renewed before two or three other judges in the High Court before Mr Straw has a chance to make a final decision. Belgium has said it will appeal. Later, Amnesty International said the \"fairness and transparency\" of the procedure followed by Mr Straw to assess Pinochet's mental condition \"remain in doubt\". The human rights group said in a statement: \"We took action in court in an effort to ensure that all decisions in the extradition proceedings are reached in a fair and transparent manner. \"Throughout the proceedings we have called for justice, not politics.\" Amnesty said it was continuing its call on Mr Straw to honour the requests made by the parties, including Belgium, France, Spain and Switzerland, to allow them to nominate experts to carry out another medical examination and for him to make the original medical report available. \"Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done,\" said Amnesty.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the afterword to his play, Death and the Maiden, the story of a torture victim of a dictatorship confronting her torturer after the country had returned to democracy, the Chilean writer Ariel Dorfman poses a number of questions: \"How can those who tortured and those who were tortured coexist in the same land? How to heal a country that has been traumatised by repression if the fear to speak out is still omnipresent? And how do you reach the truth if lying has become a habit? How do we keep the past alive without becoming its prisoner?\"</p> <p>While the main question in the minds of Chileans at the moment may be what, if anything, will happen to General Pinochet when, and if, he returns, the underlying questions are those posed by Dorfman. How does a country deal with the legacy of the dictatorship when its victims and its protagonists may, as happens in Dorfman's play, bump into each other by chance? How do Pinochet's prisoners ensure that they do not remain locked in the dungeons of the past?</p> <p>Coca Rudolphy was one of Chile's leading actresses and a known leftwinger when she was arrested in 1973. Although she was the daughter of an admiral, she was tortured on what was known as the \"barbecue\", a bed-like contraption on which she was held with electrodes attached to her body, kept in solitary confinement for 40 days, then taken to a concentration camp.</p> <p>She was eventually released in 1975, after pressure from Amnesty International and Equity. When her father was warned that, if she was detained again, she would be killed, she went into exile in Britain. Her story appeared in the Guardian in 1976 and she returned to Chile in 1984. Three years later, a rightwing terrorist group warned her and 80 other actors and writers that if they did not leave the country within 30 days they would be assassinated. Those threatened, along with the Superman actor Christopher Reeve, who flew in to show his support, put on a show on the day of the deadline. Everyone stayed.</p> <p>Like the woman in Dorfman's play, Rudolphy had met one of her torturers after her release: \"You fantasise what you will do if one day you find them, but when it happened I felt nothing. He took my arm and said, 'I know you. How are you?' I said, 'You certainly know me very well' - because when you are tortured you are naked - 'I'm OK.' I felt nothing. I despised him and we coexist because we have to coexist.</p> <p>\"I don't feel any rancour now. I'm happy to be alive. In personal terms, I don't feel anger but, if it had happened to my brother, maybe I would feel differently. I can cope with it - and I'm glad we are in a democracy now.\"</p> <p>When Rudolphy first returned to Chile, Pinochet was still in power and she was blacklisted as an actor. But the most difficult part for her was the national denial of what had happened: \"It was worse than being in jail. You felt that all you had been through was for nothing, that nobody cared. People would not talk about it at all. Now everyone, even the rightwing, accepts that torture went on and the most painful thing is their arrogance. When there are people who say it was 'necessary', it is very difficult to accept. But I am at peace with myself.\"</p> <p>Psychiatrist Elizabeth Lira has been working with victims of torture for more than 15 years. She has also watched the effect of the detention of Pinochet on the national psyche of Chile. \"Hate and fear increase if you don't recognise those emotions,\" she says. For those reasons she believes it is important that Chile now examines and articulates what has happened to the country. \"The normal reaction is that people do not want to know because it means that they have to confront horrible things.\" Some of her patients, she says, had been able to carry on with their lives, but others lived permanently in the shadow of the torture.</p> <p>\"Sometimes people who had been tortured had to sign a declaration when they were released saying that they had not been mistreated. They would then feel that it was impossible for a judge to believe them when they later said they had signed the statement out of fear.\" For the victims, she says, it is important to have some sort of acknowledgement, to have a judgment of Pinochet.</p> <p>For the supporters of Pinochet, too, says Lira, the revelations that have emerged during the 15 months of his detention in Britain have been problematic: \"If you recognise that this man has supported torture, it implies that you have supported it too and, for some people, that is not possible.\" For them, his detention has been educational, because they suddenly find themselves as the supposedly aggrieved party and are furious that he should be detained in this way, while accepting that others could be detained and even killed because it was \"necessary\".</p> <p>\"While he is still in England it is much easier to discuss everything here,\" says Lira. \"The armed forces were like totems, icons - invulnerable. Now that has ended, and people realise that the only way to have normality is not to have totems.\"</p> <p>Diana Duhalde is one of those who were tortured after the coup. She is now a professor of photography in Santiago. She says that while she does not live in fear, she is \"prudent\" about what she says and to whom. Now she thinks that if Pinochet is not to be tried in Europe it is better that he returns to Chile, \"so that he does not become a martyr\". (Others have said that they would welcome Pinochet's return to Chile - so they could dance on his grave.)</p> <p>Since they were usually blindfolded, perhaps only 20% of the surviving victims can identify their torturers (in Dorfman's play, the victim, Paulina, recognises her interrogator only by his voice), but it has been possible to trace some of them. A French television team has been in Santiago confronting torturers with their victims. The results have not been shown in Chile, but the film, shot with a hidden camera, shows that most of the torturers first deny any involvement at all - one says that he was only in the torture centre to take his lunch - then say that they personally did not participate, and finally try to end the interview.</p> <p>For many Chileans, one of the most disturbing aspects of the torture has been to discover that doctors had assisted, either by patching up victims so they could continue to be interrogated, or by advising on how information could best be obtained. Another speciality of the Dina (secret police) teams was to bring relatives of the victims to watch or listen to the torture.</p> <p>What has emerged from the testimonies of those interviewed as part of the investigation into Pinochet is the sheer pornographic sadism of his subordinates: a father forced to bugger his son; a dog made to rape a woman; a man dragged along the ground by a rope attached to a helicopter; suspects opened up with carving knives before they were dumped in the sea, so that their bodies would not float.</p> <p>As the tide turned against Pinochet in the late 80s, details of the torture started to emerge. Following the formation of the Rettig commission, set up by the democratically elected president Patricio Aylwin in 1990, agreements were made to give recompense, in the form of pensions, to the relatives of those who had been killed. In addition, more than 20 people have now been jailed, including Manuel Contreras, the head of Dina.</p> <p>One of the Rettig commission's members was the human rights lawyer and former deputy director general of Amnesty International, Jose Zalaquett. An old friend of Ariel Dorfman, he, too, has pondered the questions of the torturer and the tortured and of how a nation moves out of the darkness.</p> <p>\"Religions put a premium on forgiveness,\" he says, \"but there is a great confusion here. There can be no absolution if you don't acknowledge what you have done, atone for it and prepare to make recompense.\" He believes that it will take two generations before the national wounds are healed; there are the victims, and then there are the children who grew up knowing what had happened to their parents. But Zalaquett also believes that, because the source of what happened in Chile was political rather than ethnic or religious, reconciliation will be relatively swift.</p> <p>For the hardline Pinochet supporters, acknowledgment of systematic torture is not acceptable. At a gathering of people praying for the general's safe return last week, one woman, asked if she accepted that there had been torture, replied: \"The only torture was by the Marxists who tortured the police and the soldiers.\" A 60ft statue commemorating \"the police martyrs\" erected during the Pinochet era stands in the centre of Santiago. Another woman - most of his more vocal supporters are women, as are most of the organisers of the human rights groups - said: \"They say that thousands were tortured but there were no more than 80.\" Others excuse it with a reference to omelettes - you can't make one without breaking a few eggs.</p> <p>One of the chief torture centres was the Villa Grimaldi in Penalolen, on the dusty outskirts of Santiago. It has now been turned into a \"peace park\" with the names of those who were killed or tortured - \"physical pressure\" was the official word for it - written on a wall. Among the names, reflecting the politics of their parents' generation, are young men called Stalin Aguilera and Washington Cid.</p> <p>The British surgeon, Sheila Cassidy, was held here while she was questioned about a man she had treated for a bullet wound. She, too, was tied to the \"barbecue\", had electrodes inserted into her vagina, was gagged and told to lift a finger when she was ready to talk. She, like many others who survived, was made to sign a statement saying that she had not been treated badly while under detention.</p> <p>The building at the Villa Grimaldi itself has been demolished, but there are signs marking its different functions: one plaque marks the place where cars were driven over prisoners' legs, another where the barbecue was operated. The old main gate to the villa, through which the blindfolded prisoners were driven on what was, for many of them, their last journey, is padlocked now. The sign reads: \"This door will remain closed forever.\"</p> <p>What many Chileans are now coming to accept is that the doors that have been locked to the past have to be opened again. The old commander-in-chief, the man whose rank gave him the ultimate official responsibility for the deaths and the torture, seems about to return to his homeland and Chileans have to wait to see if truth and reconciliation will follow. There are risks on all sides. As Gerardo, the husband of the tortured Paulina in Death and the Maiden, says: \"People can die from an excessive dose of truth.\"</p>",

The old commander-in-chief, the man whose rank gave him the ultimate official responsibility for the deaths and the torture, seems about to return to his homeland and Chileans have to wait to see if truth and reconciliation will follow. There are risks on all sides. As Gerardo, the husband of the tortured Paulina in Death and the Maiden, says: \"People can die from an excessive dose of truth.\"",

There are some darn good online newspapers. But the major newspaper companies have not succeeded in building anything close to a Yahoo, eBay or Amazon.com.

But so far that has not been enough. </p> <p>Why, when a newspaper company comes along with a keen vision and a plump purse, has success been elusive? There are a number of reasons: </p> <p>1) A lack of a clear objective and focused product. Many newspapers have tried to build an online version of the newspaper, one that emulates their print mission, which is to be all things to all people, and advertisers. </p> <p>A typical American newspaper will receive about two thirds of its revenue from advertisers who are trying to reach 30-50% of the readership. Print advertising, from the splashy, full-page display ads of auto dealers to the three-line classifieds, cuts across numerous industries, and includes major accounts with million-dollar schedules as well as mom-and-pops who buy occasionally. </p> <p>While this diversity seems to work fine in print, it has counted against newspapers on the net, where \"category killer\" niche websites can do a superior job. To attract advertisers in each of those industries requires a newspaper company to either build a dozen or more top-flight stand-alone websites in such categories as cars, real estate, employment, entertainment, personal finance, travel, health and tech news, or build the same number of \"channels\" for a portal, or city site. For those who have taken the latter course, the result has often been a dense, difficult to navigate hodgepodge. </p> <p> Each way, the company's resources and focus are pulled in a dozen directions. And for each site, the competition will be fierce from \"pure play\" niche internet sites, such as the Monster.com employment site, the Travelocity travel site, and the tech news-and-reviews heavyweight Cnet.com. </p> <p>2) Failure to market the product. One would think that newspaper companies, which sell ads, would understand the need to promote a product. But even where large newspaper companies have joined to build a single product line, such as Classified Ventures, the promotion has been meagre compared to the ubiquitous national campaigns of Yahoo!, AOL, Cnet and the other pure internet firms. Most papers have restricted promotion to house ads and editorial teasers in the paper, assuming this would drive traffic to their websites. Only a few have spent money advertising in other media. </p> <p>3) A difficult labour market. Newspapers have low labour costs. Journalists are among the lowest-paid college-educated professionals. A similar advantage is gained on the sales side, with pay mostly commission-based. But in San Francisco, people with just months of web experience are snatched up by non-newspaper companies. If the newspaper attempts to pay web staffers more, unrest among print staff results. For big city papers, the problem can be the opposite: due to union wages, inflexible work rules and bad blood between labour and management, some papers find it difficult or impossible to build a competitive internet business in-house. </p> <p>4) Failure to raise capital. Newspapers have found it difficult to raise the capital to compete with highly-valued online portals, search engines and city guides trying to home in on the paper's local information franchise. The internet firms have access to large amounts of cash from venture capitalists. </p> <p>5) Poor management. Poor not because the managers are incompetent, but because they've been asked to do the impossible. The owners have asked management to save the print business while growing an entirely new business from the ground up. They have shown a misunderstanding of what it takes to be successful in such a complicated, fast-changing climate. </p> <p>These print managers were trained and grew up in the traditional newspaper business, where it has taken decades just to get everyone using coloured ink. The glacial pace of change in the newspaper world is the opposite of what it is in the internet sphere, where whole industry sectors are born and die in a matter of months. That's the main reason companies such as the New York Times are building new businesses, with managers drawn from outside the publishing world. So far, however, neither company has been able to make a major impact, even with the spin-off strategy. </p> <p>6) Journalism, as defined by highbrow traditionalists and communications school professors, no longer seems to carry the weight it once did. The digital generation appears content to get its news from the margins of Yahoo. Long think-pieces about the World Bank just don't fit anyone's schedule any more. </p> <p>Whether newspapers can re-invent themselves to be relevant in the new age remains to be seen. New lessons will need to be learned, old habits dropped. Technology will have to play a much bigger role in the planning and strategy of the modern news service. There will need to be more young managers with fresh ideas. Journalists must adjust to the cultural shift by dispensing with some of the old sacred cows and finding a better balance between giving the public what it wants and what it needs. </p> <p>Perhaps the industry's best strategy is to stay afloat as long as possible, hoping that the armada of internet dreadnoughts blow each other out of the water, or that by some miracle the Wired World finds its way back through some wormhole to a time when real news and real journalism matter.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Oprah Winfrey, a woman who claims never to have visited her own website unaided, will launch Oprah Goes Online this week on a new cable television network targeted at women. The chat-show diva, a multi-billionaire who gets staff to print out the 3,000 emails she receives a day, will invite viewers to join her on a 12-week course in mastering the internet both on air and online. Fans will be able to watch the show on Sunday and then follow an online tutorial any time they like.</p> <p> The new show will be a flagship for Oxygen Media, a new network which launches tomorrow. It will be the latest attempt to grab hold of one of the most prized markets in the media industry today - online women.</p> <p> Oxygen Media, which will reach 10m US homes with its first programme tomorrow, is one of several companies in the US which believes that this potential market has gone largely untapped. Under Geraldine Laybourne, its founder and the woman credited with making Nickelodeon the US's most popular station for children, Oxygen aims to link its television diet of chat shows and news with interactive events and information on its websites.</p> <p> It is hardly the first television company to do so. Viacom, Laybourne's former employer, has launched a popular website on the back of MTV and other channels. But Oxygen has set itself the task of building a cable network offering original programming at the same time as a website for all women aged between 18 and 49. While still embryonic, its plans for interaction between the two media appear ambitious.</p> <p> Linda Corradina, executive producer of Trackers, the new network's daily programme for teenage girls, says: 'This is different from any kind of traditional job I have ever had. When people pitch a story here, they ask whether it will make a good web story.' She adds that it will be different from most rival television shows in not offering a 'for more information turn to our website' link. Trackers is perhaps the best example of how Oxygen is trying to make the television audience and the web surfer one and the same. Young women (the target audience is between 16 and 20) will be able to email a resident therapist of the show for on air answers to their problems. The two-hour afternoon programme will be linked 24 hours a day to an online chatroom where girls will be encouraged to talk about their interests and desires. The emphasis will be on useful information and entertainment rather than agony aunt. 'We want to give them the tools to navigate their lives and we want them to have fun,' says Corradina.</p> <p> The 10-year MTV veteran recognises the importance of brand loyalty - or 'stickiness' in the jargon - for new media products. 'If you grab them as young women, they will grow up with us. They will become Oxygen women,' she says.</p> <p> The value of that 'Oxygen woman' is huge to the fledgling company. Women accounted for half of all internet users in the US for the first time at the end of last year, according to figures released by AdRelevance, a research group in the US. Not only is that an increase from 43% at the beginning of 1998, it also represents a sort of holy grail to e-commerce aficionados. Kurt Barnard, publisher of the Barnard Retail Monitor Report, says that women buy about 75% of all goods sold at American shopping centres. If that figure can be translated to the web - traditionally seen as the home of the (male) cyber-geek who would rather look at porn than buy anything - online companies devoted to women will be as attractive to advertisers as Vogue. Heavy-hitting Oxygen investors, which include Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, as well as America Online, are salivating at the opportunities presented by new women-focused offerings. They see viewers watching a cooking programme, reviewing a demonstration online and then buying the ingredients and pans needed with the click of a mouse.</p> <p> Oxygen faces tough competition from established media companies and online rivals. Lifetime, the only other US channel exclusively devoted to women, is to relaunch its website at the end of February.

      "bodyText": "Oprah Winfrey, a woman who claims never to have visited her own website unaided, will launch Oprah Goes Online this week on a new cable television network targeted at women. The chat-show diva, a multi-billionaire who gets staff to print out the 3,000 emails she receives a day, will invite viewers to join her on a 12-week course in mastering the internet both on air and online. Fans will be able to watch the show on Sunday and then follow an online tutorial any time they like. The new show will be a flagship for Oxygen Media, a new network which launches tomorrow. It will be the latest attempt to grab hold of one of the most prized markets in the media industry today - online women. Oxygen Media, which will reach 10m US homes with its first programme tomorrow, is one of several companies in the US which believes that this potential market has gone largely untapped. Under Geraldine Laybourne, its founder and the woman credited with making Nickelodeon the US's most popular station for children, Oxygen aims to link its television diet of chat shows and news with interactive events and information on its websites. It is hardly the first television company to do so. Viacom, Laybourne's former employer, has launched a popular website on the back of MTV and other channels. But Oxygen has set itself the task of building a cable network offering original programming at the same time as a website for all women aged between 18 and 49. While still embryonic, its plans for interaction between the two media appear ambitious. Linda Corradina, executive producer of Trackers, the new network's daily programme for teenage girls, says: 'This is different from any kind of traditional job I have ever had. When people pitch a story here, they ask whether it will make a good web story.' She adds that it will be different from most rival television shows in not offering a 'for more information turn to our website' link. Trackers is perhaps the best example of how Oxygen is trying to make the television audience and the web surfer one and the same. Young women (the target audience is between 16 and 20) will be able to email a resident therapist of the show for on air answers to their problems. The two-hour afternoon programme will be linked 24 hours a day to an online chatroom where girls will be encouraged to talk about their interests and desires. The emphasis will be on useful information and entertainment rather than agony aunt. 'We want to give them the tools to navigate their lives and we want them to have fun,' says Corradina. The 10-year MTV veteran recognises the importance of brand loyalty - or 'stickiness' in the jargon - for new media products. 'If you grab them as young women, they will grow up with us. They will become Oxygen women,' she says. The value of that 'Oxygen woman' is huge to the fledgling company. Women accounted for half of all internet users in the US for the first time at the end of last year, according to figures released by AdRelevance, a research group in the US. Not only is that an increase from 43% at the beginning of 1998, it also represents a sort of holy grail to e-commerce aficionados. Kurt Barnard, publisher of the Barnard Retail Monitor Report, says that women buy about 75% of all goods sold at American shopping centres. If that figure can be translated to the web - traditionally seen as the home of the (male) cyber-geek who would rather look at porn than buy anything - online companies devoted to women will be as attractive to advertisers as Vogue. Heavy-hitting Oxygen investors, which include Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, as well as America Online, are salivating at the opportunities presented by new women-focused offerings. They see viewers watching a cooking programme, reviewing a demonstration online and then buying the ingredients and pans needed with the click of a mouse. Oxygen faces tough competition from established media companies and online rivals. Lifetime, the only other US channel exclusively devoted to women, is to relaunch its website at the end of February. The Disney and Hearst-backed company is expected to offer greater connections between the new site and its cable programmes, which already reach more than 75m US homes. Hearst, publisher of several women's magazines, is also behind Women.com Networks, a women-only website launched last year.

      "body": "<p>Tolerance. It's an excellently soothing word; one used almost promiscuously by politicians, leader writers and churchmen intent on spreading a little even-handed balm. For who, pray, seeks an intolerant society? We all need tolerance, oodles of tolerance. But what the hell do we mean by it?</p> <p>The most relevant text, for the moment, flows fresh from the pen of the Chief Rabbi - and inevitably concerns that great test of sexual tolerance called section 28. So Dr Jonathan Sacks climbs gingerly up on the tightrope already swaying under the weight of Cardinal Winning, Archbishop Carey, the editors of the Sun and the Daily Mail, and the boss of Stagecoach buses.</p> <p>\"I can never forget, as a Jew, that homosexuals were sent to Auschwitz just as Jews were. Therefore, if our society has become more tolerant, that is a good thing,\" says Dr Sacks. So that's all right, then? It wouldn't be a \"good thing\" to send gays to the gas chamber.</p> <p>\"However\" - there is always a however - \"the current proposal (to repeal section 28) is based on a fundamental confusion between tolerance and moral judgment. Tolerance means treating with respect people whose positions are fundamentally different from your own. It does not mean regarding those views as equally valid.\"</p> <p>Here, essentially, the Chief Rabbi echoes Cantuar. \"I condemn totally prejudice against anyone on the basis of sexual orientation. But I also resist placing homosexual relationships on an equal footing with marriage as the proper context for sexual intimacy,\" in the Carey version. Sacks does not, to be fair, go the Winning way and talk of \"perversion\" - let alone about an \"active and militant lobby\" mustering its forces \"all over Europe\" to threaten \"the Christian family\". Tolerance has its boundaries.</p> <p>But now the phone rings. It's one of our daughters and she's pretty upset. She wants to talk about tolerance, too.</p> <p>We have two daughters. They are identical twins, born 10 minutes apart. Suckled at the same breast, tended side by side in adjacent cots. They grew up together, played together, made friends together. They went to the same schools and achieved the same spread of results in (mostly) the same subjects. They played the same games and sang the same songs. They are, even today, difficult for strangers to tell apart when they dress alike. Two peas from the same pod. Same genes; same everything. One is gay and one is not.</p> <p>\"How interesting!\" the occasional child psychologist will say at the occasional dinner party. It must have been nurture, not nature. Well, perhaps; but don't ask me how that came to pass. They were loved and cherished equally in the most natural sense; brought up without a flicker of difference between them that I can recall. They remain their own best friends.</p> <p>It is my elder (gay) daughter who calls. She's listening to another radio debate about section 28 and the familiar liberal defences being trotted out there are just so feeble. A \"tolerant\" society? An excuse for not thinking, for the denial of human identity.</p> <p>And that, of course, is right when you pause over her distress. Right from where she sits - and right for us, the witnesses who never seem to get called when the tide of purse-lipped toleration starts running again, the parents of gay children we respect and love.</p> <p>When our twins are home for a family birthday party, what do we say? Do we echo the Chief Rabbi and affirm that one daughter, happily married with a baby, is secure in \"moral judgment\" because she has not \"abandoned a moral code shared by virtually all the world's great religions\" - whilst her identical twin, has suffered a \"moral confusion\" which renders her existence somehow less \"valid\"? Deserving of \"tolerance\" but not of equality?</p> <p>Do we sing along with the Archbishop of Canterbury and \"resist placing homosexual relationships on an equal footing with marriage as the proper context for sexual intimacy\"? Welcome to the C of E premiership and the depths of its first division. One sister has a loving husband, the other a loving partner. Both are family. What on earth, in the human terms which are the only terms that matter, is George Carey wittering on about? How would he draw his lines in our home at Christmas?</p> <p>Section 28's language speaks, coldly, for itself. \"A local authority shall not (a) intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality; and (b) promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.\"</p> <p>You can, I'm afraid, hear the likes of Cardinal Winning mouthing such phrases, building them into a bulwark against repeal. \"Cast your minds back to the dark days of the second world war,\" he declaims. \"In place of the bombs of 50 years ago, you find yourselves bombarded with images, values and ideas which are utterly alien.\"</p> <p>But what is the \"promotion\" of such values? And what is a \"pretended family relationship?\" My daughter - troubled and uncertain from the age of 13 on - found nothing to help or to guide her at school: merely an RE teacher the cardinal would have embraced. She did not, to our subsequent chagrin, confide in her parents until her mind was clear. She had damn all in the way of information, let alone the illusion of town hall propaganda. She was left alone to struggle through the most difficult years.</p> <p>Where is there the least hint of Christianity in that? When did Christ - abandoning any mention of love - inveigh against \"pretended family relationships\" (which the Daily Mail, for its own reasons, defines as an \"equal alternative to marriage\")? Why does it sometimes seem that Robert Mugabe must be the natural leader of this panic-stricken crusade?</p> <p>The repeal of section 28 won't transform society. There will still be vicious playground bullying of the kind copiously documented by teachers themselves. There will still be prejudice and fear. Bits of law do not, in themselves, change our world. But the fight, for all that, has a momentous symbolism attached. It forces every one of us to look into ourselves and decide what's right. It allows no political weaselings. No hiding place.</p> <p>My daughter isn't some notional stereotype invented to scare elderly cardinals. Nor is she a visitor from an alien place. She is like millions more in the world around - and we, in turn, are like millions of other parents. This is our flesh and blood; part of us, a reflection of us. We don't have to say she's equal. She IS equal. And no drizzle of incomprehension, no fear fostered in ignorance, no puny section, can alter that. It isn't tolerance we need. It is knowing what makes our hearts beat.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tolerance. It's an excellently soothing word; one used almost promiscuously by politicians, leader writers and churchmen intent on spreading a little even-handed balm. For who, pray, seeks an intolerant society? We all need tolerance, oodles of tolerance. But what the hell do we mean by it? The most relevant text, for the moment, flows fresh from the pen of the Chief Rabbi - and inevitably concerns that great test of sexual tolerance called section 28. So Dr Jonathan Sacks climbs gingerly up on the tightrope already swaying under the weight of Cardinal Winning, Archbishop Carey, the editors of the Sun and the Daily Mail, and the boss of Stagecoach buses. \"I can never forget, as a Jew, that homosexuals were sent to Auschwitz just as Jews were. Therefore, if our society has become more tolerant, that is a good thing,\" says Dr Sacks. So that's all right, then? It wouldn't be a \"good thing\" to send gays to the gas chamber. \"However\" - there is always a however - \"the current proposal (to repeal section 28) is based on a fundamental confusion between tolerance and moral judgment. Tolerance means treating with respect people whose positions are fundamentally different from your own. It does not mean regarding those views as equally valid.\" Here, essentially, the Chief Rabbi echoes Cantuar. \"I condemn totally prejudice against anyone on the basis of sexual orientation. But I also resist placing homosexual relationships on an equal footing with marriage as the proper context for sexual intimacy,\" in the Carey version. Sacks does not, to be fair, go the Winning way and talk of \"perversion\" - let alone about an \"active and militant lobby\" mustering its forces \"all over Europe\" to threaten \"the Christian family\". Tolerance has its boundaries. But now the phone rings. It's one of our daughters and she's pretty upset. She wants to talk about tolerance, too. We have two daughters. They are identical twins, born 10 minutes apart. Suckled at the same breast, tended side by side in adjacent cots. They grew up together, played together, made friends together. They went to the same schools and achieved the same spread of results in (mostly) the same subjects. They played the same games and sang the same songs. They are, even today, difficult for strangers to tell apart when they dress alike. Two peas from the same pod. Same genes; same everything. One is gay and one is not. \"How interesting!\" the occasional child psychologist will say at the occasional dinner party. It must have been nurture, not nature. Well, perhaps; but don't ask me how that came to pass. They were loved and cherished equally in the most natural sense; brought up without a flicker of difference between them that I can recall. They remain their own best friends. It is my elder (gay) daughter who calls. She's listening to another radio debate about section 28 and the familiar liberal defences being trotted out there are just so feeble. A \"tolerant\" society? An excuse for not thinking, for the denial of human identity. And that, of course, is right when you pause over her distress. Right from where she sits - and right for us, the witnesses who never seem to get called when the tide of purse-lipped toleration starts running again, the parents of gay children we respect and love. When our twins are home for a family birthday party, what do we say? Do we echo the Chief Rabbi and affirm that one daughter, happily married with a baby, is secure in \"moral judgment\" because she has not \"abandoned a moral code shared by virtually all the world's great religions\" - whilst her identical twin, has suffered a \"moral confusion\" which renders her existence somehow less \"valid\"? Deserving of \"tolerance\" but not of equality? Do we sing along with the Archbishop of Canterbury and \"resist placing homosexual relationships on an equal footing with marriage as the proper context for sexual intimacy\"? Welcome to the C of E premiership and the depths of its first division. One sister has a loving husband, the other a loving partner. Both are family. What on earth, in the human terms which are the only terms that matter, is George Carey wittering on about? How would he draw his lines in our home at Christmas? Section 28's language speaks, coldly, for itself. \"A local authority shall not (a) intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality; and (b) promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship.\" You can, I'm afraid, hear the likes of Cardinal Winning mouthing such phrases, building them into a bulwark against repeal. \"Cast your minds back to the dark days of the second world war,\" he declaims. \"In place of the bombs of 50 years ago, you find yourselves bombarded with images, values and ideas which are utterly alien.\" But what is the \"promotion\" of such values? And what is a \"pretended family relationship?\" My daughter - troubled and uncertain from the age of 13 on - found nothing to help or to guide her at school: merely an RE teacher the cardinal would have embraced. She did not, to our subsequent chagrin, confide in her parents until her mind was clear. She had damn all in the way of information, let alone the illusion of town hall propaganda. She was left alone to struggle through the most difficult years. Where is there the least hint of Christianity in that? When did Christ - abandoning any mention of love - inveigh against \"pretended family relationships\" (which the Daily Mail, for its own reasons, defines as an \"equal alternative to marriage\")? Why does it sometimes seem that Robert Mugabe must be the natural leader of this panic-stricken crusade? The repeal of section 28 won't transform society. There will still be vicious playground bullying of the kind copiously documented by teachers themselves. There will still be prejudice and fear. Bits of law do not, in themselves, change our world. But the fight, for all that, has a momentous symbolism attached. It forces every one of us to look into ourselves and decide what's right. It allows no political weaselings. No hiding place. My daughter isn't some notional stereotype invented to scare elderly cardinals. Nor is she a visitor from an alien place. She is like millions more in the world around - and we, in turn, are like millions of other parents. This is our flesh and blood; part of us, a reflection of us. We don't have to say she's equal. She IS equal. And no drizzle of incomprehension, no fear fostered in ignorance, no puny section, can alter that. It isn't tolerance we need. It is knowing what makes our hearts beat.",

Now it seems that their story has caught the eye of several leading American film companies.</p> <p>Disney, Telstar and Buena Vista and Julia Roberts' agent have all approached the women, keen to make a film of their story. But the women, as one might expect from the WI, are being straightforward about the whole business. </p> <p>Says WI member Tricia Stewart, \"We've been contacted by Hollywood and it's funny because they're so pushy. But we'd want [a film] done over here. Maureen Lipman invited us down to Women of the Year last year and was so lovely to us that we'd love her to be involved.\" </p> <p>Probably not quite what Hollywood has in mind.</p> <p><strong>Fury over BBFC's End of the Affair ruling</strong></p> <p>Stephen Woolley, producer of <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Jordan,+Neil\">Neil Jordan</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/Film_Page/0,4061,119523,00.html\">The End of the Affair</a>, has hit out at the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) for giving the film an 18 certificate.</p> <p>Woolley is furious that the adaptation of Graham Greene's novel, which stars <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/Player/Player_Page/0,4159,43032,00.html\">Ralph Fiennes</a> as a novelist who has an affair with a married woman (<a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Moore,+Julianne\">Julianne Moore</a>) has been given such a prohibitive rating. In an interview with the Independent, Woolley said that whilst he never expected a large teenage audience, the 18 certificate would now make the film appear \"ugly\" to an adult audience. \"Any parent with a 16-year-old would love them to see The End of the Affair\", he said. \"Now, many parents will be put off seeing the film themselves\". </p> <p>Woolley believes the BBFC's decision was based on two scenes: one where \"Ralph's bottom was pumping too many times\" and another where Fiennes and Moore are seen outstretched on a bed. The ruling comes as a surprise to those who thought the BBFC was adopting a more liberal approach to film censorship, but according to Robin Duval, the BBFC's director, the new guidelines will not come into force until later this year and until then the BBFC is bound by its current ruling which restricts simulated sex scenes to the 18 certificate.</p> <p> <strong> Brosnan's seventh 007 in 007?</strong> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/Player/Player_Page/0,4159,45364,00.html\">Pierce Brosnan</a> wants to equal <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Moore,+Roger\">Roger Moore</a>'s record and star in seven Bond films.</p> <p>Empire Online reveal that the 007 star is in negotiations to appear in four more Bond films, bringing his total to seven.

      "bodyText": "Last April the story of the women's institute members who posed naked behind strategically placed sieves and arranged flowers for a fund-raising calendar caused a flurry of media interest and money for Leukaemia research. The tale of Rylstone and District Women's Institute's alternative glamour calendar shot across the Atlantic, and nine months later, the New York Times ran an article on the pin-ups. Now it seems that their story has caught the eye of several leading American film companies. Disney, Telstar and Buena Vista and Julia Roberts' agent have all approached the women, keen to make a film of their story. But the women, as one might expect from the WI, are being straightforward about the whole business. Says WI member Tricia Stewart, \"We've been contacted by Hollywood and it's funny because they're so pushy. But we'd want [a film] done over here. Maureen Lipman invited us down to Women of the Year last year and was so lovely to us that we'd love her to be involved.\" Probably not quite what Hollywood has in mind. Fury over BBFC's End of the Affair ruling Stephen Woolley, producer of Neil Jordan's The End of the Affair, has hit out at the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) for giving the film an 18 certificate. Woolley is furious that the adaptation of Graham Greene's novel, which stars Ralph Fiennes as a novelist who has an affair with a married woman (Julianne Moore) has been given such a prohibitive rating. In an interview with the Independent, Woolley said that whilst he never expected a large teenage audience, the 18 certificate would now make the film appear \"ugly\" to an adult audience. \"Any parent with a 16-year-old would love them to see The End of the Affair\", he said. \"Now, many parents will be put off seeing the film themselves\". Woolley believes the BBFC's decision was based on two scenes: one where \"Ralph's bottom was pumping too many times\" and another where Fiennes and Moore are seen outstretched on a bed. The ruling comes as a surprise to those who thought the BBFC was adopting a more liberal approach to film censorship, but according to Robin Duval, the BBFC's director, the new guidelines will not come into force until later this year and until then the BBFC is bound by its current ruling which restricts simulated sex scenes to the 18 certificate. Brosnan's seventh 007 in 007? Pierce Brosnan wants to equal Roger Moore's record and star in seven Bond films. Empire Online reveal that the 007 star is in negotiations to appear in four more Bond films, bringing his total to seven. His stunt double Douglas James explains: \"He wants to do seven films in all, equalling Roger's record and - if you count Never Say Never Again - matching Sean's total. But his record will be the best - his seventh film will be released in 2007, making it 007 in 007\". Keen to go head to head with Brosnan in one of those films is Eastenders star and former Spandau Ballet singer Martin Kemp. The actor, who made his screen debut as Reggie Kray in The Krays and recently told The Sun that none of Bond's previous villains were as handsome as him, but \"that's all about to change\", is in preliminary talks with production company EON to play the lead baddie. Whether Bond will be made in England is another matter: the German city of Cologne has pledged free use of the city to EON and a good rate at their new movie studio complex. Tim Burton joins the Shockwave set Tim Burton has signed a deal with Shockwave.com to develop original animation for the web. The director of Sleepy Hollow will create 26 episodes of a new series based on Stain Boy, a character from his 1997 cartoon book, The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories.

The Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) said it did not believe that the film's scenes of real sex offended standards generally accepted by reasonable adults and has given the film an 18 certificate. Girlfight, a film about a woman determined to become a champion boxer, and You Can Count on Me, a drama about a brother and sister who struggle to maintain a sense of family after their parents are killed in a car crash, have split the grand jury prize for best dramatic film at this year's Sundance Film Festival.

In Japan, 1,000 of these gadgets have been bought by people looking for a mate and the manufacturers expect to sell half a million by next month.

Karen Mooney, director of Sara Eden Introductions, which specialises in thirtysomething matchmaking, has seen a 75% increase in membership in the past year. \"Younger women in particular,\" she says, \"have become more discerning in what they want. They're looking for someone who can be a friend but everything else as well. It's become more important to be with a man who is not going to be competitive or jealous of their success. Women are much more specific in their requirements and more likely to ask what guarantees they're going to get. They are in control of their own destiny.\"</p> <p>It follows that matchmaking ventures that shun the random in favour of the specific are attractive to younger women. Emotional identification with our working environment has led us to apply goal-oriented office skills to finding a mate: if you're looking for a job, you go to an employment agency; if you want a holiday, you call a travel agent; if you want a partner, why not try a dating agency? \"People don't want to waste time,\" Mooney explains. \"It's better to put your cards on the table at the start. That way, you're fishing where the fish are.\"</p> <p>It is significant that the generation of women eager to exercise more control over who they see as potential mates is the same generation to have reaped the benefits of feminism from birth.

This fine-tuning of criteria for Mr Right betrays the anxiety women feel about how far they compromise in a relationship and reveals that well-rehearsed concern: some men are relationship-illiterate and will never learn otherwise.</p> <p>Cate Liston, 26, placed a small ad in a newspaper last year after growing frustrated with \"meeting men in my own peer group who were emotionally immature.

I was the advertiser and I felt empowered.\"</p> <p>Matchmaking ventures require an individual to put a price on how much they are worth - not as a wage-earner, but as a partner. It is only when you have identified what makes you a good mate that you begin to ask who exactly could match it. But placing a small ad, going on to a dating website or joining an agency supplies women only with men on those books and all too often supply does not meet demand. During the 17 years that Lyn Davies, chair of the Association of British Introduction Agencies, has worked in the industry, she says there is one demand, apart from the obligatory GSOH, that has remained constant: men look for women 10 years younger, women look for men the same age.</p> <p>Mooney, too, notes that men in their late 20s and early 30s may be less concerned about a woman's age, but they are more interested in looks, while women invariably want a man \"who can think emotionally. She wants to communicate with her partner.\"</p> <p>Rebecca McCrain, now 42, joined a dating agency in her late 30s and a friend then placed a small ad on her behalf. \"So many of the guys I've met want to meet loads of women and have a shag,\" she says. \"Or they want to enhance their social life. I'm using the small ads to meet a partner.\"</p> <p>Though McCrain's friends knew she was going on blind dates, she felt \"uncomfortable\" about going public. \"I felt as if I were a failure. That I couldn't get my act together, that I wasn't attractive.\" She says she intends to stop using matchmaking enterprises. \"I want my normal life back. Endless nights out with strangers make me feel like a performing seal. It's terribly hard work trying to be up and bouncy.\"</p> <p>For all the agencies' talk of the stigma of sad lonely hearts having vanished, a new stigma has replaced it as many young women now feel ashamed to admit they are actively looking for a partner - the fallout, perhaps, of being told that to be single is to be happy. Psychotherapist Susie Orbach says the tension between wanting a relationship and being told being alone is OK makes women anxious about the desire to attach. \"Women are hounded by scare stories about the biological clock. They are told if they don't have a partner by a certain age, they never will. But there isn't actually a decrease in people's need for intimacy and attachment.\"</p> <p>Perhaps we should view the rise in pro-active dating as a way to achieve attachment now that traditional social stuctures are disintegrating. Dating organisations are being embraced by a generation of women and men raised in a service culture. Kate Fox, director of the Social Issues Research Centre, believes turning to an agency is not a departure from more formalised matchmaking but a return to it. \"The idea that matchmaking can happen spontaneously is new.

In first-class cricket last season he scored 566 runs at 25.73, took 48 catches and made two stumpings. He and his wife, Lisa, also run an art business, Martin Speight Limited. </em></p> <p>\"Painting-wise this winter, I've had various commissions, from Test and county grounds to local grounds and teddy bears. A bit of everything really, including portraiture. I went full-time with the business after I stopped wintering in New Zealand - my last winter over there was 1994-95.</p> <p>When I started it was very much an <em>ad hoc</em> type arrangement and it went on like that for quite a while. I was just doing it for a bit of fun. I hadn't really promoted my art until the last two winters. It wasn't until the advent of Lisa that I really started looking at it as more than just paying the bills. </p> <p>I do all sorts of painting - watercolours, pastels, oils. It all depends. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and think I'm just not in the mood for an oil today, so I'll do a watercolour. I did Art A-Level and a little bit at Uni, though mostly I had better things to do there. Lots of people ask me if I paint during a game when I'm waiting to bat, but I actually find I can't focus on it then. I paint to relax, like some people go fishing or play golf. I talk a bit about painting with Jack Russell, but usually only when we play against each other. </p> <p> Lisa and I got married in September 1997. We've no kids but a Weimaraner dog (a German gun dog) who is 15 months old. It is a lot more trouble than children. It is called Cloudy Bay - as in the wine from New Zealand, which I drank a lot of when I was over there. </p> <p>I've been doing quite a bit of training - it seems to be my job to run the dog. I've been going to the gym, playing a bit of squash and we've started some training up at Chelmsford with Graham Gooch, who is Durham's batting coach. Other than that, a bit of partying, a bit of reading - it's the Wine Atlas of France at the moment. It is dumbfounding - each region has a wine peculiar to itself. I quite like my wine. We went over to France just before Christmas to stock up, like all the rest of the world. </p> <p>I live a totally separate life during the winter. I rent up in Durham in the summer, and don't really have the time to socialise. When you're playing four, five, six days a week the last thing you want to do is have people over for dinner. If I do come back to Brighton I tend to just flake out. During the winter I live here. Lisa is a Brighton girl and I'm from mid-Sussex so it is home to us. The North East is very different to the South East - different location, people, climate, attitude. It is colder up there and quite hard work. Hove is a lovely place to play as a batsman. The members there are just happy to see a good day's play. They'll enjoy seeing Hick get a hundred because it is good cricket. Up in Durham, and probably Yorkshire and Lancashire as well, people are more openly passionate about their sport and their local side. If you're doing well then great, but they expect a reasonable degree of success. At Hove you never hear anyone shout out; at Durham they aren't shy of saying what they think. </p> <p> We don't go back to training proper until the end of March, which is quite late. Durham exceeded expectation last year by coming eighth and I think our top aim is to stay in division one of the Championship, which will be quite a good ask.

      "bodyText": "Martin Speight, 32, is wicketkeeper for Durham, whom he joined in 1997 after 11 years with Sussex. In first-class cricket last season he scored 566 runs at 25.73, took 48 catches and made two stumpings. He and his wife, Lisa, also run an art business, Martin Speight Limited. \"Painting-wise this winter, I've had various commissions, from Test and county grounds to local grounds and teddy bears. A bit of everything really, including portraiture. I went full-time with the business after I stopped wintering in New Zealand - my last winter over there was 1994-95. When I started it was very much an ad hoc type arrangement and it went on like that for quite a while. I was just doing it for a bit of fun. I hadn't really promoted my art until the last two winters. It wasn't until the advent of Lisa that I really started looking at it as more than just paying the bills. I do all sorts of painting - watercolours, pastels, oils. It all depends. Sometimes I wake up in the morning and think I'm just not in the mood for an oil today, so I'll do a watercolour. I did Art A-Level and a little bit at Uni, though mostly I had better things to do there. Lots of people ask me if I paint during a game when I'm waiting to bat, but I actually find I can't focus on it then. I paint to relax, like some people go fishing or play golf. I talk a bit about painting with Jack Russell, but usually only when we play against each other. Lisa and I got married in September 1997. We've no kids but a Weimaraner dog (a German gun dog) who is 15 months old. It is a lot more trouble than children. It is called Cloudy Bay - as in the wine from New Zealand, which I drank a lot of when I was over there. I've been doing quite a bit of training - it seems to be my job to run the dog. I've been going to the gym, playing a bit of squash and we've started some training up at Chelmsford with Graham Gooch, who is Durham's batting coach. Other than that, a bit of partying, a bit of reading - it's the Wine Atlas of France at the moment. It is dumbfounding - each region has a wine peculiar to itself. I quite like my wine. We went over to France just before Christmas to stock up, like all the rest of the world. I live a totally separate life during the winter. I rent up in Durham in the summer, and don't really have the time to socialise. When you're playing four, five, six days a week the last thing you want to do is have people over for dinner. If I do come back to Brighton I tend to just flake out. During the winter I live here. Lisa is a Brighton girl and I'm from mid-Sussex so it is home to us. The North East is very different to the South East - different location, people, climate, attitude. It is colder up there and quite hard work. Hove is a lovely place to play as a batsman. The members there are just happy to see a good day's play. They'll enjoy seeing Hick get a hundred because it is good cricket. Up in Durham, and probably Yorkshire and Lancashire as well, people are more openly passionate about their sport and their local side. If you're doing well then great, but they expect a reasonable degree of success. At Hove you never hear anyone shout out; at Durham they aren't shy of saying what they think. We don't go back to training proper until the end of March, which is quite late. Durham exceeded expectation last year by coming eighth and I think our top aim is to stay in division one of the Championship, which will be quite a good ask. Also, over the three years that Boon was captain we steadily improved our Championship cricket, but our one-day stuff was pretty poor. With the staff we have, I think we can hope to be challenging for promotion to the top division of the National League. At New Year about 50 of us went to someone's house in Brighton for a black-tie do. We started about 8pm and finished around 6 in the morning. It was very nice indeed.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Contrary to tobacco companies' long-standing claims that cigarette smuggling concerns only the work of organised crime or rogue employees beyond their control, internal files of British American Tobacco, the world's second-largest multinational tobacco company, show that smuggling was exploited by senior personnel of the parent company and its subsidiaries as part of a worldwide marketing strategy to increase revenue.</p> <p>The documents, covering mostly 1990-1995, do not suggest that BAT employees transported contraband cigarettes across customs borders, where taxes would be due. Instead, they show that corporate executives in Britain, the United States and other areas controlled the brands, marketing campaigns and timing and sought to manage volumes and price levels of smuggling markets. Corporate executives worked closely with their local agents and gave incentives to local distributors.</p> <p>Responding to questions, BAT said it knew that some of its products \"are handled other than through official channels\", but added: \"We cannot control the distribution chain all the way to the final customer.\" BAT's corporate and regulatory affairs director, Michael Prideaux, admitted recently: \"If people wish to draw the inference that we are turning a blind eye to smuggling, they are free to do so.\"</p> <p>There is no suggestion that BAT broke the law, but it did more than turn a blind eye. BAT and its subsidiaries used a carefully coded language. Only occasionally did they use such terms as \"smuggled\" or \"contraband\". The preferred euphemisms of company correspondence were \"DNP\" (duty not paid), \"transit\" or \"GT\" (general trade), as well as \"parallel market\", \"second channel\", and \"border trade\". The euphemisms were used interchangeably and contrasted repeatedly with references to imports that were legal and \"DP\" (duty paid).</p> <p>Three years ago two BAT managers admitted charges related to tobacco smuggling. One had already left the company, the other retired in December 1997, six months after pleading guilty to charges over a scheme that shipped cigarettes marked \"Duty Not Paid\" and \"Not for Sale in Canada\" back into Canada from Louisiana, where they had been sent allegedly bound for offshore fishing boats.</p> <p><b> Sanguine</b></p> <p>Suspicions of tobacco industry involvement in cigarette smuggling have grown since 1997 when researchers demonstrated, by comparing annual global exports with global imports, that about a third of all cigarettes entering international commerce each year could not be accounted for. The industry's sanguine reaction to apparently losing a third of its inventory annually fuelled suspicions of corporate involvement with smuggled products.</p> <p>But proof remained elusive until last year, when millions of pages of corporate documents, unearthed during health-related lawsuits, became publicly available as part of the tobacco industry's November 1998 settlement with the US states.</p> <p>The information in those documents could prove far more costly to the companies than the \u00a3154bn US settlement, because BAT, like its multinational rival Philip Morris, has focused on expanding business into international and newly emerging markets - the areas where smuggling seems to have flourished.</p> <p>In Colombia, 21 state governors and the mayor of Bogota have engaged American lawyers to prepare lawsuits in the US against British American Tobacco and Philip Morris, said Jose Manuel Arias Carrizosa, executive director of the federation of Colombian governors. He said they were seeking \"an indemnification for damages caused through contraband of cigarettes into the country\".</p> <p>\"We think there are two markets, one legitimate that pays its duties and taxes, and the other much bigger, illegal,\" he said. \"That cannot be happening without the knowledge of the producing companies.\"</p> <p>Canada filed a lawsuit against RJ Reynolds and its related tobacco companies in New York state in December 1999 for smuggling across the US/Canadian border. Several people, including a former RJR senior sales manager, have been convicted in the US over that smuggling operation. An RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company spokeswoman said the company was \"not involved in the day-to-day business operations of any international operations\", and that the company had not been implicated in the criminal investigations.</p> <p>Smuggled cigarettes, by evading import and sales taxes, are usually sold more cheaply than legally imported cigarettes. That makes them affordable to a greater number of people, increases corporate profits, and secures future markets. But because smuggling puts cigarettes in more hands, especially younger ones, it is not just an issue for tax collectors.</p> <p>The World Bank last year predicted that by 2030 smoking would be the single leading cause of death in the world, killing one in six adults. The Bank warned that smoking deaths would increasingly occur in low- and middle-income countries, least able to afford the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. It recommended raising taxes on tobacco to reduce consumption.</p> <p>The BAT documents make two points clear: ranking executives of BAT and its subsidiaries used smuggling by others as part of their overall strategy to increase market share, and they employed a series of euphemisms to plan and mask their activities. The documents, especially as they relate to company operations in Latin America, repeatedly identify legal imports as either \"duty paid\" (DP) or \"duty free\" (DF) for traditional duty-free stores. Those phrases are consistently used in opposition to terms such as \"DNP\", \"transit\", or \"GT\", and those contrasting terms appear regularly throughout memos, letters, charts, and graphs of import/export data and sales figures.</p> <p>A memo from the early 1990s, entitled \"Venezuelan market definitions and assumptions\", explained that \"duty paid\" goods owed the government legal excise taxes of 50%. No such requirement was noted for the \"duty not paid\" goods, which were identified as cigarettes produced in Venezuela, exported mainly to the free-trade zone on the nearby island of Aruba, and then returned to the Venezuelan market as \"transit\". The memo came from the file of Keith Dunt, then BAT's regional director for Latin America, who is now the company's finance director with a seat on the board.</p> <p>In a February 16 1993 fax to BAT headquarters in Britain its Venezuelan subsidiary explained: \"Since November 1992 the transit (DNP) product into Venezuela have been very low due to tighter border controls.\"</p> <p>During a fierce trademark dispute with Philip Morris over which company had the right to use the Belmont brand name in Colombia, a February 22 1995 memo outlined contingency options should BAT lose. One was to \"maintain current Belmont GT channel and launch new brand in DP\". However, a noted drawback of keeping Belmont in the GT channel was that the company \"cannot support Belmont in GT via advertising\".</p> <p>Les Thompson, the RJR senior sales manager who pleaded guilty in 1999 to money-laundering charges stemming from the US/Canadian smuggling operation, said that DNP was also a euphemism his company used to talk about smuggling. \"It's an industry-wide term,\" Thompson said. \"It's essentially a long-winded term used by senior folks when they're talking around the topic of smuggling.\" Other euphemisms for smuggled cigarettes, Thompson said, were \"re-entry\" goods, the \"parallel market\" and \"transit\".</p> <p>Colombia - a country racked by decades of civil war and cocaine trading, with a long history as a crossroads of contraband - proved to be fertile ground for cigarette smuggling.</p> <p><b> Contraband</b></p> <p>The BAT records show that millions of cigarettes were shipped from BAT subsidiaries in the US, Venezuela and Brazil to distributors in the free-trade zone of Aruba, an island in the Caribbean just off the coast of Colombia that historically had been a mecca for contraband. The cigarettes could be sold and end up in the hands of smugglers who could take them by boat to to Colombia's La Guajira region, an isolated and lawless haven along the Caribbean coastline. The Guajira peninsula, which straddles the northern border of Colombia and Venezuela, has been a smugglers' paradise since colonial times.</p> <p>Maicao is a town in La Guajira that was given special customs status in 1991 in order to spur job growth. The law allowed for goods to pass from Maicao into the Colombian interior if they were declared to customs officials and duty paid.</p> <p>BAT records track how smugglers moved cigarettes outside the Maicao special customs zone \"duty not paid\" and on to the black market. A \"DNP distribution\" graph in Mr Dunt's files showed DNP cigarettes travelling from Aruba to Maicao and from there westward to the \"consumer\" in Barranquilla, outside the tax-free area.</p> <p>One document in the files showed that officials from BAT and its subsidiaries supplying Colombia - Brown &amp; Williamson, Souza Cruz, Cigarrera Bigott - agreed at a Miami meeting in January 1992 that Souza Cruz would give a 5% \"free goods incentive in Maicao and in the San Andresitos to expand distribution in Bogota and Medellin\". The term \"sanandresitos\" - from the Colombian island of San Andres which has been a tax-free port since the early 1950s - refers to the clusters of small stalls found in many Colombian cities.</p> <p>Asked by ICIJ if a company doing business in Colombia might not know about sandandresitos, Fanny Kertzman, the director of the country's tax and customs office, responded: \"This question is ridiculous. It is obvious, so evident most of the merchandise sold there is smuggled.\"</p> <p>In 1993 corporate records show that BAT subsidiaries imported a total of 3.98bn cigarettes into Colombia. However, 3.89bn of those cigarettes entered as duty not paid goods.</p> <p>The BAT documents show that cigarettes also moved from Aruba to Panama's free-trade zone of Colon as a staging point into nearby Turbo, another special customs zone in Colombia, from where they would make their way into the country's black market. In addition, some of the cigarettes shipped from Venezuela to Aruba and on to Maicao went back into Venezuela. Similar smuggling operations went on farther south, too, with cigarettes from BAT's Brazilian subsidiary Souza Cruz being shipped through Paraguay into Argentina. Although BAT was not involved in the smuggling, they marketed the brands to improve sales.</p> <p>The most glaring exception in the records to BAT's carefully coded language involved its Canadian subsidiary, which was not named in Canada's recently filed smuggling lawsuit. In a June 3 1993 letter to Ulrich Herter, BAT's managing director, the president of Imperial Tobacco Limited, Don Brown, wrote: \"As you are aware, smuggled cigarettes (due to exorbitant tax levels) represent nearly 30% of total sales in Canada, and the level is growing. Although we agreed to support the federal government's effort to reduce smuggling by limiting our exports to the USA, our competitors did not. Subsequently, we have decided to remove the limits on our exports to regain our share of Canadian smokers. To do otherwise would place the long-term welfare of our trademarks in the home market at great risk. Until the smuggling issue is resolved, an increasing volume of our domestic sales in Canada will be exported, then smuggled back for sale here.\"</p> <p>Other documents show that BAT executives were aware of the \"sensitivity\" of the issue. One of them, Delcio Laux, president of BAT's Venezuelan subsidiary, wrote in an April 21 1992 faxed memo to Mr Dunt that \"it is clear that Bigott can't be seen as a clean and ethical company by continuing with DP and DNP in parallel\".</p> <p>Two months later Mr Dunt wrote to Eduardo Grant, president of BAT's Argentine subsidiary, Nobleza-Piccardo, about the \"DNP market\" there. \"We will be consulting here on the ethical side of whether we should encourage or ignore the DNP segment. You know my view is that it is part of your market and to have it exploited by others is just not acceptable,\" Mr Dunt said.</p> <p>Notes on a meeting in Colombia in February, which Mr Dunt attended, said it had been agreed that \"the Bogota office will be clean by Q3/94 in reference to DNP information. Management of DNP will be in Caracas.\" Soon after, Mr Dunt was advised that \"documents dealing with DNP have been separated and should now be forwarded to Caracas. A good quality safe and shredder are required.\"</p> <p>Apart from the euphemisms, what stands out most in the documents is how senior management of BAT and its subsidiaries sought to manage markets in smuggled goods. The full extent of its involvement in Latin America was made clear in a stern note from Mr Dunt to his fellow directors questioning the wisdom of allowing BAT's wholly owned Brazilian subsidiary, Souza Cruz, into Argentina, where it would cannibalise the sales of BAT's majority-owned Argentine subsidiary, Nobleza-Piccardo.</p> <p>\"I am advised by Souza Cruz that [BAT Industries] has endorsed the approach that the Brazilian Operating Group increase its share of the Argentinian market via DNP,\" Mr Dunt wrote in the May 18 1993 memo. \"As the director entrusted with responsibility for the management of Nobleza-Piccardo I need to advise you of the likely volume effect on N-P of this decision and of course the financial impact.\"</p> <p>Another memo found in Mr Dunt's file, summarising a February 23-24 1994 visit to Colombia, noted of the Kent Super Lights brand that \"DNP product should be launched two weeks after the DP product has been launched\". As for the Lucky Strike brand, it was planned \"to withdraw from the DNP market the 20s and 10s versions\".</p> <p>Further examples of BAT's awareness of and benefit from DNP markets include a \"restricted\" note of a chief executive's committee meeting on February 7 1994, which said that a new marketing unit for Latin American countries aimed to achieve annual cigarette sales of 50 billion, \"including duty not paid\". The meeting was chaired by Barry D Bramley, then chairman of BAT's tobacco operations. And BAT's Latin American \"Marketing Guidelines for Company Plan 1995-1999\" instructed local managers in Colombia that \"your plan should cover the launch of variants on the DP and DNP markets\".</p> <p>The documents also show BAT used the presence of legal imports, however small, as an \"umbrella\", or cover, to advertise its brand of cigarettes, which would reach the market in far larger quantities via DNP, according to the documents.</p> <p>Mr Dunt wrote in August 1992 to Mr Bramley: \"A small volume of duty paid exports would permit advertising and merchandising support in order to establish the brands for the medium/long term, with the market being supplied initially primarily through the DNP channel.\"</p> <p><b> Competition</b></p> <p>Fierce competition for market share drove many of BAT's actions in Latin America, the documents suggest. However, they also show that company executives had discussions with representatives of Philip Morris International about \"DNP\" and \"transit\".</p> <p>At a meeting on February 14 1992 in New York, Philip Morris's then president for the Latin American region, Peter Schreer, and his deputy Fred Hauser met BAT's Keith Dunt and David Etchells. \"Transit business from Paraguay into Argentina needs to be watched, particularly bearing in mind industry agreement on quantum level of excise,\" said a file memo written by Mr Etchells, after the discussions.</p> <p>In August 1992 the representatives met again, at the smart Pennyhill Park country club near BAT headquarters outside London, according to a \"secret\" document summarising their talks. \"PMI raised the 'contraband from Honduras' issue which was counteracted by BATCo's raising the price gap argument. No ground conceded on either side,\" the notes said.</p> <p>\"BATCo suggested an aggressive price increase to be negotiated at a local level for DNP to be implemented if possible by the end of August,\" the notes later said.</p> <p>The nexus of cigarette smuggling and drug money laundering in Latin America is known as the black market peso exchange, in which \"peso brokers\" convert US dollars from drug lords into clean pesos. Their sources of clean pesos are smugglers who need US dollars to purchase international goods. James Johnson of the US treasury department has called the system \"primarily an exchange of currencies\" but one that is \"perhaps the most dangerous and damaging form of money laundering that we have ever encountered\".</p> <p>With access to US dollars regulated by Colombian law and administered by banks, requiring proof of legal import, the peso broker \"offers a businessman a choice and the drug trafficker an opportunity\", Bonni Tischler, US customs service assistant commissioner for investigations, told the June 1999 congressional hearing. She said the cigarette industry was one of the \"most affected\" by the black market peso exchange.</p> <p>\"Some American companies, and I would give Philip Morris as an example, have been accused of implicitly supporting the black market peso exchange in order to increase their market share in Colombia and avoid paying hefty Colombian taxes,\" noted the hearing's chairman, Senator Charles Grassley.</p> <p>The BAT documents suggest that company officials were aware of the linkage between cigarette smuggling and money laundering, and they discussed how black market money flows in Aruba affected their business.</p> <p>The BAT documents end, for the most part, in 1995. Since the mid-1990s legal imports of cigarettes have risen exponentially in Colombia.

      "bodyText": "Contrary to tobacco companies' long-standing claims that cigarette smuggling concerns only the work of organised crime or rogue employees beyond their control, internal files of British American Tobacco, the world's second-largest multinational tobacco company, show that smuggling was exploited by senior personnel of the parent company and its subsidiaries as part of a worldwide marketing strategy to increase revenue. The documents, covering mostly 1990-1995, do not suggest that BAT employees transported contraband cigarettes across customs borders, where taxes would be due. Instead, they show that corporate executives in Britain, the United States and other areas controlled the brands, marketing campaigns and timing and sought to manage volumes and price levels of smuggling markets. Corporate executives worked closely with their local agents and gave incentives to local distributors. Responding to questions, BAT said it knew that some of its products \"are handled other than through official channels\", but added: \"We cannot control the distribution chain all the way to the final customer.\" BAT's corporate and regulatory affairs director, Michael Prideaux, admitted recently: \"If people wish to draw the inference that we are turning a blind eye to smuggling, they are free to do so.\" There is no suggestion that BAT broke the law, but it did more than turn a blind eye. BAT and its subsidiaries used a carefully coded language. Only occasionally did they use such terms as \"smuggled\" or \"contraband\". The preferred euphemisms of company correspondence were \"DNP\" (duty not paid), \"transit\" or \"GT\" (general trade), as well as \"parallel market\", \"second channel\", and \"border trade\". The euphemisms were used interchangeably and contrasted repeatedly with references to imports that were legal and \"DP\" (duty paid). Three years ago two BAT managers admitted charges related to tobacco smuggling. One had already left the company, the other retired in December 1997, six months after pleading guilty to charges over a scheme that shipped cigarettes marked \"Duty Not Paid\" and \"Not for Sale in Canada\" back into Canada from Louisiana, where they had been sent allegedly bound for offshore fishing boats. Sanguine Suspicions of tobacco industry involvement in cigarette smuggling have grown since 1997 when researchers demonstrated, by comparing annual global exports with global imports, that about a third of all cigarettes entering international commerce each year could not be accounted for. The industry's sanguine reaction to apparently losing a third of its inventory annually fuelled suspicions of corporate involvement with smuggled products. But proof remained elusive until last year, when millions of pages of corporate documents, unearthed during health-related lawsuits, became publicly available as part of the tobacco industry's November 1998 settlement with the US states. The information in those documents could prove far more costly to the companies than the \u00a3154bn US settlement, because BAT, like its multinational rival Philip Morris, has focused on expanding business into international and newly emerging markets - the areas where smuggling seems to have flourished. In Colombia, 21 state governors and the mayor of Bogota have engaged American lawyers to prepare lawsuits in the US against British American Tobacco and Philip Morris, said Jose Manuel Arias Carrizosa, executive director of the federation of Colombian governors. He said they were seeking \"an indemnification for damages caused through contraband of cigarettes into the country\". \"We think there are two markets, one legitimate that pays its duties and taxes, and the other much bigger, illegal,\" he said. \"That cannot be happening without the knowledge of the producing companies.\" Canada filed a lawsuit against RJ Reynolds and its related tobacco companies in New York state in December 1999 for smuggling across the US/Canadian border. Several people, including a former RJR senior sales manager, have been convicted in the US over that smuggling operation. An RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company spokeswoman said the company was \"not involved in the day-to-day business operations of any international operations\", and that the company had not been implicated in the criminal investigations. Smuggled cigarettes, by evading import and sales taxes, are usually sold more cheaply than legally imported cigarettes. That makes them affordable to a greater number of people, increases corporate profits, and secures future markets. But because smuggling puts cigarettes in more hands, especially younger ones, it is not just an issue for tax collectors. The World Bank last year predicted that by 2030 smoking would be the single leading cause of death in the world, killing one in six adults. The Bank warned that smoking deaths would increasingly occur in low- and middle-income countries, least able to afford the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. It recommended raising taxes on tobacco to reduce consumption. The BAT documents make two points clear: ranking executives of BAT and its subsidiaries used smuggling by others as part of their overall strategy to increase market share, and they employed a series of euphemisms to plan and mask their activities. The documents, especially as they relate to company operations in Latin America, repeatedly identify legal imports as either \"duty paid\" (DP) or \"duty free\" (DF) for traditional duty-free stores. Those phrases are consistently used in opposition to terms such as \"DNP\", \"transit\", or \"GT\", and those contrasting terms appear regularly throughout memos, letters, charts, and graphs of import/export data and sales figures. A memo from the early 1990s, entitled \"Venezuelan market definitions and assumptions\", explained that \"duty paid\" goods owed the government legal excise taxes of 50%. No such requirement was noted for the \"duty not paid\" goods, which were identified as cigarettes produced in Venezuela, exported mainly to the free-trade zone on the nearby island of Aruba, and then returned to the Venezuelan market as \"transit\". The memo came from the file of Keith Dunt, then BAT's regional director for Latin America, who is now the company's finance director with a seat on the board. In a February 16 1993 fax to BAT headquarters in Britain its Venezuelan subsidiary explained: \"Since November 1992 the transit (DNP) product into Venezuela have been very low due to tighter border controls.\" During a fierce trademark dispute with Philip Morris over which company had the right to use the Belmont brand name in Colombia, a February 22 1995 memo outlined contingency options should BAT lose. One was to \"maintain current Belmont GT channel and launch new brand in DP\". However, a noted drawback of keeping Belmont in the GT channel was that the company \"cannot support Belmont in GT via advertising\". Les Thompson, the RJR senior sales manager who pleaded guilty in 1999 to money-laundering charges stemming from the US/Canadian smuggling operation, said that DNP was also a euphemism his company used to talk about smuggling. \"It's an industry-wide term,\" Thompson said. \"It's essentially a long-winded term used by senior folks when they're talking around the topic of smuggling.\" Other euphemisms for smuggled cigarettes, Thompson said, were \"re-entry\" goods, the \"parallel market\" and \"transit\". Colombia - a country racked by decades of civil war and cocaine trading, with a long history as a crossroads of contraband - proved to be fertile ground for cigarette smuggling. Contraband The BAT records show that millions of cigarettes were shipped from BAT subsidiaries in the US, Venezuela and Brazil to distributors in the free-trade zone of Aruba, an island in the Caribbean just off the coast of Colombia that historically had been a mecca for contraband. The cigarettes could be sold and end up in the hands of smugglers who could take them by boat to to Colombia's La Guajira region, an isolated and lawless haven along the Caribbean coastline. The Guajira peninsula, which straddles the northern border of Colombia and Venezuela, has been a smugglers' paradise since colonial times. Maicao is a town in La Guajira that was given special customs status in 1991 in order to spur job growth. The law allowed for goods to pass from Maicao into the Colombian interior if they were declared to customs officials and duty paid. BAT records track how smugglers moved cigarettes outside the Maicao special customs zone \"duty not paid\" and on to the black market. A \"DNP distribution\" graph in Mr Dunt's files showed DNP cigarettes travelling from Aruba to Maicao and from there westward to the \"consumer\" in Barranquilla, outside the tax-free area. One document in the files showed that officials from BAT and its subsidiaries supplying Colombia - Brown &amp; Williamson, Souza Cruz, Cigarrera Bigott - agreed at a Miami meeting in January 1992 that Souza Cruz would give a 5% \"free goods incentive in Maicao and in the San Andresitos to expand distribution in Bogota and Medellin\". The term \"sanandresitos\" - from the Colombian island of San Andres which has been a tax-free port since the early 1950s - refers to the clusters of small stalls found in many Colombian cities. Asked by ICIJ if a company doing business in Colombia might not know about sandandresitos, Fanny Kertzman, the director of the country's tax and customs office, responded: \"This question is ridiculous. It is obvious, so evident most of the merchandise sold there is smuggled.\" In 1993 corporate records show that BAT subsidiaries imported a total of 3.98bn cigarettes into Colombia. However, 3.89bn of those cigarettes entered as duty not paid goods. The BAT documents show that cigarettes also moved from Aruba to Panama's free-trade zone of Colon as a staging point into nearby Turbo, another special customs zone in Colombia, from where they would make their way into the country's black market. In addition, some of the cigarettes shipped from Venezuela to Aruba and on to Maicao went back into Venezuela.

One of them, Delcio Laux, president of BAT's Venezuelan subsidiary, wrote in an April 21 1992 faxed memo to Mr Dunt that \"it is clear that Bigott can't be seen as a clean and ethical company by continuing with DP and DNP in parallel\". Two months later Mr Dunt wrote to Eduardo Grant, president of BAT's Argentine subsidiary, Nobleza-Piccardo, about the \"DNP market\" there. \"We will be consulting here on the ethical side of whether we should encourage or ignore the DNP segment.

Notes on a meeting in Colombia in February, which Mr Dunt attended, said it had been agreed that \"the Bogota office will be clean by Q3/94 in reference to DNP information.

In August 1992 the representatives met again, at the smart Pennyhill Park country club near BAT headquarters outside London, according to a \"secret\" document summarising their talks. \"PMI raised the 'contraband from Honduras' issue which was counteracted by BATCo's raising the price gap argument. No ground conceded on either side,\" the notes said. \"BATCo suggested an aggressive price increase to be negotiated at a local level for DNP to be implemented if possible by the end of August,\" the notes later said.

Keith Dunt, was the company's regional director for Latin America in the early 90s and has since been promoted to finance director with a seat on the London board. Mr Dunt, 52, an accountant, has spent a quarter of a century with BAT since joining as an international auditor. Ulrich Herter joined the BAT board in 1990 and was made managing director in charge of its tobacco interests two years later. A German economist, 57-year-old Mr Herter has a reputation for toughness and has spent his working life in the tobacco industry. Nick Brookes, 49, was director of new business development in the early 90s until being appointed chairman and chief executive officer of BAT's US subsidiary Brown &amp; Williamson five years ago. He is the regional director for America-Pacific and is on BAT's management board. Barry Bramley was chairman of BAT's tobacco operations and was a reasonably prominent member of the Confederation of British Industry, serving on the business body's European committee. Mark Waterfield was an executive of BAT's Venezuelan subsidiary, Bigott. Martin Broughton , BAT's \u00a31m-a-year chairman, will be under pressure to investigate what his senior executives were up to.",

The total allocation of funds is \u20ac213bn, which, spread over seven years, is a smaller annual allocation in real terms than the amount allocated in 1999 of \u20ac28bn. If the EU is serious about regional convergence and cohesion, it needs to increase substantially the size of the budget, particularly to tackle unemployment. The scourge of unemployment is the greatest economic challenge facing Europe and the consequences of regional neglect could threaten the future of both economic and political union.

Mr Woodhead appeared to put himself on collision course with the government by saying in a Sunday newspaper interview that he had no evidence from any schools that the rule was doing any harm. Ministers decided to repeal the legislation after concluding that it was stopping teachers from teaching sex education properly and dealing with homophobic behaviour.

In the film Beyond a Phase: A Practical Guide to Challenging Homophobia, one boy tells pupils that to obtain sexual satisfaction, they should \"try experimenting with both boys and girls to see who you feel most comfortable with\". Pupils are asked whether he should have unprotected gay sex with his boyfriend. The health authority said that teenage homosexuality is part of \"the real world\" and the video, which is being distributed to schools across Britain, aims to reduce suicides and sexually transmitted diseases. However it has caused controversy among family campaigners and MPs.

But whoever is elected mayor, the study's authors also warn, will face a tube funding gap of up to \u00a3175m a year whatever method of finance is used - and that shortfall can only be met either by higher fares or increased government subsidy. The report by the public policy unit at University College London dismisses as unrealistic the government's claims for its public-private partnership proposal, which would hand over the tube infrastructure to private operators for 30 years. Campaign workers for Frank Dobson, the candidate backed by Tony Blair and Mr Livingstone's main rival, estimated last night that as many as 70% of London's nearly 50,000 paid-up Labour members have already voted in the tightly fought ballot to pick the party's mayoral nominee. Today's UCL study was commissioned by the three rail unions - the train drivers' union Aslef, the Rail Maritime and Transport union and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association - but one of the report's authors, senior fellow Declan Gaffney, insisted yesterday that the unions had not influenced the content. \"We would have said exactly the same if it had been commissioned by the government,\" Mr Gaffney said.

Amid fears that the peace process could unravel in days, senior officials \"hit the telephones\" in the hope of finding some common ground between Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein. Hopes of reaching a compromise began to fade when sources close to the international decommissioning body indicated it was unlikely to report any breakthrough today. John de Chastelain, the Canadian general who heads the body, is expected to report that the IRA has not even agreed a timetable on disarmament during a series of meetings in recent weeks. However, he is planning to delay his long-awaited report until later today in the hope of a change of heart by the IRA. He will then pass his findings to the British and Irish goverments which are expected to publish his report tomorrow. Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern have been briefed on intense behind-the-scenes discussions, and British sources last night insisted they had not lost hope of a late breakthrough. \"We are not at the suspension stage yet.

We are not suggesting a rabbit will be pulled out of the hat, but these things in Northern Ireland have a tendency to go right down to the wire,\" the sources said. The frantic preparations for the publication of the de Chastelain report came as Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists clashed once again over disarmament. Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, made clear that the IRA was not yet prepared to disarm, while the Ulster Unionist party leader, David Trimble, hinted that he would resign if the IRA failed to deliver. Speaking on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Adams dismissed Mr Trimble's demand as a \"unilateral deadline\" which was outside the terms of the Good Friday agreement. \"It just is not within my grasp to deliver it on their terms and neither is it my responsibility,\" he said.

After each crisis Ulster's political leaders have dusted themselves down and moved on to produce an extraordinary political settlement which would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.</p> <p>Within the next 24 hours, however, the peace process will face its severest crisis when decommissioning takes centre stage with the publication of John de Chastelain's report on his dialogue with the IRA.</p> <p>Successive governments on both sides of the Irish Sea have fudged the issue on numerous occasions since the issue of decommissioning started to haunt the province in 1995.</p> <p>Now there appears to be barely any room for manoeuvre, after David Trimble, the first minister, issued a stark warning yesterday that he cannot remain in office if the IRA refuses to disarm.</p> <p><b> Running out of road</b><br> \"Our capacity to sustain the administration with people in it who have not demonstrated a commitment to peaceful means is extremely limited, and we expected to run out of road after only a month or two,\" Mr Trimble told BBC1's On the Record.</p> <p>His insistence that decommissioning must begin now was dismissed by Gerry Adams. Speaking on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost, the Sinn Fein president said that decommissioning could only take place in line with the Good Friday agreement, which set May as a deadline.</p> <p>\"I understand why unionists want decommissioning now,\" Mr Adams said. \"It is just not within my grasp to deliver it on their terms and neither is it my responsibility.\"</p> <p>The first step of the week will be taken today when General de Chastelain, a Canadian, passes copies of his decommissioning report to the British and Irish governments.</p> <p>The general, who has won widespread respect from both sides for his even-handed approach, has held meetings in recent weeks with a leading provisional who is understood to have discussed the IRA's arsenal.</p> <p>It is understood that by last night the general still had not finalised his report as he held out hope of an eleventh-hour commitment from his IRA contact that the provisionals would begin to disarm.</p> <p>If, as seems likely, the IRA makes no move, the general is expected to outline in what sources described as a \"factual way\" his discussions with the paramilitaries.</p> <p>The very fact that the IRA decided to meet him - after insisting that it would not decommission \"through the back door or the front door\" - will be seen as an encouraging sign. But with less than four months to go before the deadline for decommissioning, there will be disappointment that there appears to be no agreement even on a timetable for disarming.</p> <p><b> Hard grind</b><br> The British government is expected to digest the report overnight before publishing it tomorrow, accompanied by a commentary. Government sources refused to say last night what would be in the commentary.</p> <p>Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, was said to be working flat out trying to broker a deal with the province's political leaders.</p> <p>Sources are making no secret of their disappointment that the IRA has failed to begin disarming. \"We have endeavoured to ensure that Sinn Fein have no excuse for the IRA's failure to disarm,\" a government source said. \"We have done what we said we would do, and the unionists have done what they said they would do.\"</p> <p>At the same time as the government publishes its report tomorrow, the Ulster Unionists will up the ante with a debate in the Northern Ireland assembly on decommissioning. This will provide a high-profile opportunity for anti-agreement unionists to vent their fury at Mr Trimble, putting pressure on him to withdraw from the executive if General de Chastelain's report is gloomy.</p> <p>There was speculation last week that Mr Mandelson could suspend the executive tomorrow or Wednesday to prevent it from being destroyed altogether by a unionist walk out.</p> <p>However, he is not expected to act immediately, for fear of precipitating a nationalist walk out. Instead, he is expected to hold intensive talks with political leaders in the hope of finding an agreement.</p> <p>If the deadlock over decommissioning is not broken by next Monday, February 7, Mr Trimble is unlikely to remain in office. On that day his party's executive meets, ostensibly to discuss the RUC, and his position will be unsustainable if there is no progress.</p> <p>In addition, his opponents in the party have his post-dated resignation letter, which would be triggered - if decommissioning has not started - when the Ulster Unionist council meets the following Saturday, February 12.</p> <p>Only the foolhardy would predict what could happen beyond then. But if the peace process does remain on track, there are two key dates. General de Chastelain is believed to have pencilled in March 14 as the date by which decommissioning must start if it is to be completed by May 22, the day laid down in the Good Friday agreement.</p>",

      "bodyText": "From the moment it was launched seven years ago, the Northern Ireland peace process has come within inches of being derailed on many occasions. After each crisis Ulster's political leaders have dusted themselves down and moved on to produce an extraordinary political settlement which would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. Within the next 24 hours, however, the peace process will face its severest crisis when decommissioning takes centre stage with the publication of John de Chastelain's report on his dialogue with the IRA. Successive governments on both sides of the Irish Sea have fudged the issue on numerous occasions since the issue of decommissioning started to haunt the province in 1995. Now there appears to be barely any room for manoeuvre, after David Trimble, the first minister, issued a stark warning yesterday that he cannot remain in office if the IRA refuses to disarm. Running out of road \"Our capacity to sustain the administration with people in it who have not demonstrated a commitment to peaceful means is extremely limited, and we expected to run out of road after only a month or two,\" Mr Trimble told BBC1's On the Record. His insistence that decommissioning must begin now was dismissed by Gerry Adams. Speaking on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost, the Sinn Fein president said that decommissioning could only take place in line with the Good Friday agreement, which set May as a deadline. \"I understand why unionists want decommissioning now,\" Mr Adams said. \"It is just not within my grasp to deliver it on their terms and neither is it my responsibility.\" The first step of the week will be taken today when General de Chastelain, a Canadian, passes copies of his decommissioning report to the British and Irish governments. The general, who has won widespread respect from both sides for his even-handed approach, has held meetings in recent weeks with a leading provisional who is understood to have discussed the IRA's arsenal. It is understood that by last night the general still had not finalised his report as he held out hope of an eleventh-hour commitment from his IRA contact that the provisionals would begin to disarm. If, as seems likely, the IRA makes no move, the general is expected to outline in what sources described as a \"factual way\" his discussions with the paramilitaries. The very fact that the IRA decided to meet him - after insisting that it would not decommission \"through the back door or the front door\" - will be seen as an encouraging sign. But with less than four months to go before the deadline for decommissioning, there will be disappointment that there appears to be no agreement even on a timetable for disarming. Hard grind The British government is expected to digest the report overnight before publishing it tomorrow, accompanied by a commentary. Government sources refused to say last night what would be in the commentary. Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, was said to be working flat out trying to broker a deal with the province's political leaders. Sources are making no secret of their disappointment that the IRA has failed to begin disarming. \"We have endeavoured to ensure that Sinn Fein have no excuse for the IRA's failure to disarm,\" a government source said. \"We have done what we said we would do, and the unionists have done what they said they would do.\" At the same time as the government publishes its report tomorrow, the Ulster Unionists will up the ante with a debate in the Northern Ireland assembly on decommissioning. This will provide a high-profile opportunity for anti-agreement unionists to vent their fury at Mr Trimble, putting pressure on him to withdraw from the executive if General de Chastelain's report is gloomy. There was speculation last week that Mr Mandelson could suspend the executive tomorrow or Wednesday to prevent it from being destroyed altogether by a unionist walk out. However, he is not expected to act immediately, for fear of precipitating a nationalist walk out. Instead, he is expected to hold intensive talks with political leaders in the hope of finding an agreement. If the deadlock over decommissioning is not broken by next Monday, February 7, Mr Trimble is unlikely to remain in office. On that day his party's executive meets, ostensibly to discuss the RUC, and his position will be unsustainable if there is no progress. In addition, his opponents in the party have his post-dated resignation letter, which would be triggered - if decommissioning has not started - when the Ulster Unionist council meets the following Saturday, February 12. Only the foolhardy would predict what could happen beyond then. But if the peace process does remain on track, there are two key dates. General de Chastelain is believed to have pencilled in March 14 as the date by which decommissioning must start if it is to be completed by May 22, the day laid down in the Good Friday agreement.",

Responding personally to the claims for the first time, Mr Kohl said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that the claim was \"absurd and a lie\". French and German television journalists last week reported claims that the late French president Mitterrand had kicked back \u00a310m into the coffers of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) to help fund its 1994 re-election campaign. The money was said to have arisen from commission generated from the sale of an east German refinery to the French oil firm Elf Acquitaine. It is the largest single amount to figure in the scandal over illegal financing that is surrounding Mr Kohl and his party. But the former chancellor told Welt am Sonntag: \"Mitterrand and I at no time talked about money in the context of elections or parties.\" He called the report a \"repulsive concoction of unproven claims, slander and anonymous 'tips', but possibly also machinations by intelligence services\".

And I profoundly reject the idea that defending your reputation should be the preserve of the rich.\" That attack on the lack of legal aid for libel came, surprisingly, from the late Sir James Goldsmith, a man not usually known for his adhesion to fashionably liberal legal causes.</p> <p>It was 1987. Goldsmith had set up a fund to help individuals bring or defend libel actions which they could not afford. Ironically, the first beneficiary was one Neil Hamilton, who, with his fellow Conservative MP Gerald Howarth, successfully sued the BBC over a Panorama programme branding them as extremists with links to fascist and racist groups. The BBC retracted and paid them each \u00a320,000 compensation plus costs. Had they lost, the Goldsmith fund - administered by libel solicitor Peter Carter-Ruck - would have uncomplainingly borne all the legal costs.</p> <p>Hamilton wasn't able to call on the Goldsmith millions to fund his libel case against Mohamed Fayed. With little money of his own, he relied on his friends and supporters to pass the hat round. Under a court order made last Friday by the trial judge, details of the larger contributors to Hamilton's fighting fund have to be disclosed to the court. Their belief in him might prove expensive - they may have to pay up far more than their original donation.</p> <p>The problem lies in the rule that the loser of a court case normally has to pay not only his own lawyers, but also the legal costs of his winning opponent. It is common for campaigning groups, trade unions or professional organisations to back litigation brought (or defended) by their members or sympathisers. They know that if their sponsored litigant loses, they'll have to pick up the legal tab. The Police Federation, for example, has backed hundreds of libel cases involving its members, the vast majority successful. When five policemen lost a libel suit against the Guardian in 1998, the federation had to pay the newspaper a six-figure sum in legal costs. But where the unsuccessful claimant is an impecunious individual, the winner can get his legal costs reimbursed only from the loser's backers. Fine if it's James Goldsmith; not so easy if it's a rag-bag collection of donors who'd given sums from a fiver to tens of thousands.</p> <p>It used to be a crime, called maintenance, for someone to finance someone else's lawsuit, unless there was some close link - such as family - or a \"community of interest\" between giver and litigant. If the backer stood to get a slice of any winnings, it was known as champerty, and was treated as even more serious. The crimes of maintenance and champerty were abolished in 1967, and a new set of legal principles was developed (especially in the 1995 case of the Symphony Group v Hodgson) to deal with examples of \"strangers\" who fund litigation. What's clear from that, and from new 1999 rules, is that the trial judge has a wide discretion to order backers of the losing party to pay towards the costs of the winner (although it's unlikely that any judge would order a close relative to stump up). He also has power to order the disclosure of the names of anyone contributing to a fighting fund.</p> <p>Mr Justice Morland demanded to know details of who had paid in more than \u00a35,000. Presumably he felt there was no point in pursuing smaller donors. But, so far, only one person has publicly admitted giving a substantial sum. It's not the first time the 10th earl of Portsmouth has played Lord Bountiful to a libel claimant. In 1989 he contributed to Count Nikolai Tolstoy's failed defence to a claim by Lord Aldington, which resulted in the biggest-ever jury award - \u00a31.5 million - over allegations of war crimes in Yugoslavia. The winner never got a penny of the money; Tolstoy had nothing.</p> <p>Portsmouth wasn't called on to pay any extra legal costs. It turned out that Aldington himself had been bankrolled, by the insurance company of which he'd been head.</p> <p>The columnist Taki, another backer of Hamilton's, has written: \"I shall not be revealing my contribution unless forced to, in which case it was \u00a34,999.\"</p> <p>He may not want to disclose how much he gave, but under the court order Lord Harris of High Cross, the fund's organiser, will have to reveal the information. Harris himself has admitted being a donor and Norris McWhirter of the Freedom Association is also known to be one.</p> <p>It would be a contempt of court, for which they could go to jail, for Lord Harris and Hamilton not to reveal what the judge has demanded. It is no excuse to claim that contributors to the fund were promised that their identities would be kept secret. Nor would backers be able to say: \"No one told me that I might have to pay more than my original contribution.\"</p> <p>Whatever the final result, this quibble about legal costs will send a message to anyone (other than a close family member) who, because of kind-heartedness or belief in a cause, is thinking of backing someone else's litigation. Don't.</p> <p>The Hamilton-Fayed litigation produced much indignation at Hamilton's fighting fund. A better cause for outrage should have been the fact that (except in small claims) litigants in England are exposed to extravagant, disproportionate and unpredictable costs. Even modest disputes can absorb large legal fees.</p> <p>Recently, a couple had to sell their house to pay \u00a319,000 costs to their opponents, in a dispute over a narrow parking space. In a divorce battle over the family home the lawyers' fees can swallow its value. In about a third of high court claims of under \u00a312,500, the costs to one side alone have been between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000.</p> <p>The English system exposes litigants to maximum risk and offers lawyers maximum profit. The system exalts the principle of justice which holds that the function of the courts is to decide cases on their true merits and not on procedural technicalities. If litigants are late in performing procedural tasks, such as providing an adequate statement of the case, they must be given more time.</p> <p>If their performance is defective, they must have a chance to rectify it. But requests for extensions or to remedy defects are often hotly contested, involving appeals and generating great expense. Paradoxically, the principle of justice-on-the-merits produces much litigation which has nothing to do with merits.</p> <p>The rule that the loser in a court case has to pay the winner's costs tends to erode resistance to cost. Given that success brings with it not only a favourable judgment but also reimbursement of legal fees and expenses, a litigant who believes that spending more will increase the chances of success has good reason for progressively raising the stakes. So both litigants become locked in an investment competition.</p> <p>Lawyers' economic interests are served by the system of hourly fees. The more complex and protracted the litigation becomes, the more they earn. Lawyers don't have to inflate procedural activity because the system does it for them. The courts have allowed litigants to engage in sterile procedural disputes. Clients' resistance to spending more and more is undermined by the hope of winning and thereby recovering all their outlay. And the system preys on their hopes and goads them into ever greater investment.</p> <p>Reforms initiated by Lord Woolf, master of the rolls, seek to establish a sensible balance between the value and complexity of disputes and their cost. Unfortunately, the new system does not radically alter the combustible mixture fuelling costs. Both the hourly fee system and the rule that the winner recovers costs from the loser have been retained. With limited exceptions, the idea of fixed-cost litigation has been abandoned in the face of resistance by the legal profession, which has found plenty of scope for hourly fees in the new procedures. And conditional fees - no-win, no-fee arrangements - which are now replacing legal aid, will in some types of claims provide lawyers with even greater opportunities for high fees.</p> <p>High and unpredictable costs deter most citizens from seeking the courts' help. Those who do are trapped in a vortex of expense which is hard to control. There are better ways of providing access to justice, if only our government could face down the vested interests involved.</p>",

It is common for campaigning groups, trade unions or professional organisations to back litigation brought (or defended) by their members or sympathisers. They know that if their sponsored litigant loses, they'll have to pick up the legal tab. The Police Federation, for example, has backed hundreds of libel cases involving its members, the vast majority successful. When five policemen lost a libel suit against the Guardian in 1998, the federation had to pay the newspaper a six-figure sum in legal costs. But where the unsuccessful claimant is an impecunious individual, the winner can get his legal costs reimbursed only from the loser's backers. Fine if it's James Goldsmith; not so easy if it's a rag-bag collection of donors who'd given sums from a fiver to tens of thousands. It used to be a crime, called maintenance, for someone to finance someone else's lawsuit, unless there was some close link - such as family - or a \"community of interest\" between giver and litigant. If the backer stood to get a slice of any winnings, it was known as champerty, and was treated as even more serious. The crimes of maintenance and champerty were abolished in 1967, and a new set of legal principles was developed (especially in the 1995 case of the Symphony Group v Hodgson) to deal with examples of \"strangers\" who fund litigation. What's clear from that, and from new 1999 rules, is that the trial judge has a wide discretion to order backers of the losing party to pay towards the costs of the winner (although it's unlikely that any judge would order a close relative to stump up). He also has power to order the disclosure of the names of anyone contributing to a fighting fund. Mr Justice Morland demanded to know details of who had paid in more than \u00a35,000. Presumably he felt there was no point in pursuing smaller donors. But, so far, only one person has publicly admitted giving a substantial sum. It's not the first time the 10th earl of Portsmouth has played Lord Bountiful to a libel claimant. In 1989 he contributed to Count Nikolai Tolstoy's failed defence to a claim by Lord Aldington, which resulted in the biggest-ever jury award - \u00a31.5 million - over allegations of war crimes in Yugoslavia. The winner never got a penny of the money; Tolstoy had nothing. Portsmouth wasn't called on to pay any extra legal costs. It turned out that Aldington himself had been bankrolled, by the insurance company of which he'd been head. The columnist Taki, another backer of Hamilton's, has written: \"I shall not be revealing my contribution unless forced to, in which case it was \u00a34,999.\" He may not want to disclose how much he gave, but under the court order Lord Harris of High Cross, the fund's organiser, will have to reveal the information. Harris himself has admitted being a donor and Norris McWhirter of the Freedom Association is also known to be one. It would be a contempt of court, for which they could go to jail, for Lord Harris and Hamilton not to reveal what the judge has demanded. It is no excuse to claim that contributors to the fund were promised that their identities would be kept secret. Nor would backers be able to say: \"No one told me that I might have to pay more than my original contribution.\" Whatever the final result, this quibble about legal costs will send a message to anyone (other than a close family member) who, because of kind-heartedness or belief in a cause, is thinking of backing someone else's litigation. Don't. The Hamilton-Fayed litigation produced much indignation at Hamilton's fighting fund. A better cause for outrage should have been the fact that (except in small claims) litigants in England are exposed to extravagant, disproportionate and unpredictable costs. Even modest disputes can absorb large legal fees. Recently, a couple had to sell their house to pay \u00a319,000 costs to their opponents, in a dispute over a narrow parking space. In a divorce battle over the family home the lawyers' fees can swallow its value. In about a third of high court claims of under \u00a312,500, the costs to one side alone have been between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000. The English system exposes litigants to maximum risk and offers lawyers maximum profit. The system exalts the principle of justice which holds that the function of the courts is to decide cases on their true merits and not on procedural technicalities. If litigants are late in performing procedural tasks, such as providing an adequate statement of the case, they must be given more time. If their performance is defective, they must have a chance to rectify it. But requests for extensions or to remedy defects are often hotly contested, involving appeals and generating great expense. Paradoxically, the principle of justice-on-the-merits produces much litigation which has nothing to do with merits. The rule that the loser in a court case has to pay the winner's costs tends to erode resistance to cost. Given that success brings with it not only a favourable judgment but also reimbursement of legal fees and expenses, a litigant who believes that spending more will increase the chances of success has good reason for progressively raising the stakes. So both litigants become locked in an investment competition. Lawyers' economic interests are served by the system of hourly fees. The more complex and protracted the litigation becomes, the more they earn. Lawyers don't have to inflate procedural activity because the system does it for them. The courts have allowed litigants to engage in sterile procedural disputes. Clients' resistance to spending more and more is undermined by the hope of winning and thereby recovering all their outlay. And the system preys on their hopes and goads them into ever greater investment. Reforms initiated by Lord Woolf, master of the rolls, seek to establish a sensible balance between the value and complexity of disputes and their cost. Unfortunately, the new system does not radically alter the combustible mixture fuelling costs. Both the hourly fee system and the rule that the winner recovers costs from the loser have been retained. With limited exceptions, the idea of fixed-cost litigation has been abandoned in the face of resistance by the legal profession, which has found plenty of scope for hourly fees in the new procedures. And conditional fees - no-win, no-fee arrangements - which are now replacing legal aid, will in some types of claims provide lawyers with even greater opportunities for high fees. High and unpredictable costs deter most citizens from seeking the courts' help. Those who do are trapped in a vortex of expense which is hard to control. There are better ways of providing access to justice, if only our government could face down the vested interests involved.",

It has been demonstrated that there is no overall financial benefit to the UK economy from our arms trade and that in some years it produces a net deficit. Setting ethical questions to one side for the moment (rather than at all times, like the DTI) any intelligent corporation executive would be seeking to diversify out of the areas where both trade and returns were erratic and caused PR problems. Kate Macintosh Winchester, Hampshire \u0095 While it is proper to consider whole-country bans where there is gross abuse of human rights, it is equally important to use the powers of government to help combat the sad record of abuses by British and European companies themselves. Our first responsibility should be to ensure that public money only goes to support companies which can demonstrate compliance with international labour, environmental and human rights. Richard Howitt MEP \u0095 You allege (Whitehall leaks reveal ethics row, January 26) that the foreign office was lukewarm about including environmental and human rights factors in the ECGD review. In fact, in contributing to the review, the foreign office wrote: \"As you know the foreign secretary has put respect for human rights and the protection of the environment at the heart of foreign policy. ECGD's mission and statement need to reflect his approach\". I do not think many of your readers would disagree. Robin Cook MP Foreign secretary",

Health and nutrition experts called on the government to tighten food regulations after a report published by the food commission today revealed that biscuits and snacks designed for babies and toddlers have a higher sugar content than many comparable adult snack foods. Despite health warnings to parents, sugary biscuits are the biggest cause of tooth decay in infants aged between one and two years. The survey by the consumer group, titled Good for Sales, Bad for Babies, found that biscuits aimed at infants had a higher sugar content than some well known adult biscuit brands. Two manufacturers, Nestl\u00e9 and Boots the Chemist, were singled out for criticism. Nestl\u00e9's Fruit Sticks were found to contain 50% sugar while Boots' Teddy Bear biscuits are 37% sugar, compared with the 36% sugar content in a jam tart. A traditional Farley's Rusk had 29% sugar, against 27% in a chocolate digestive. The commission also found that snacks claiming to have \"reduced sugar\" content, including Farley's Rusks and Hipp's First Bites, which are both 21% sugar, were sweeter than a jam doughnut with 19% sugar. Only five out of the 22 products examined were virtually sugar free. Tim Lobstein, a co-director of the commission and author of the report, described the snacks as \"health hazards\", adding: \"The baby food regulations are very weak.

Biscuits are strongly linked to an increased risk of tooth damage, with 11% of frequent biscuit eaters getting damaged teeth before they are 30 months old, compared with 1% of infants who eat biscuits less than once a day. Tim Lang, professor of food policy at Thames Valley university, called for the new food standards agency to investigate the \"irresponsible\" levels of sugar in infant snacks and cereals.

The problem threatens to undermine confidence in the government's response to the Waterhouse inquiry report on abuse in north Wales children's homes, expected to be published shortly. Of 150 authorities in England, 105 have told the department that implementation of the measures, known as Quality Protects, is being held up because 40% of designated posts remain unfilled. The figures, in a mid-year performance assessment report by the government's social services inspectorate, reflect an acute skills shortage in the social care sector. Essex social services is recruiting social workers in South Africa. Although the government has instructed authorities to make Quality Protects their top priority, the inspectorate's report revealed that many were finding it hard to fill their allocation of the 2,241 extra posts for the programme. Sixty per cent of authorities are said to have made \"significant\" progress in implementing action plans, and most others have made \"some\" progress, the report said. Often, however, this has been achieved only by using temporary or agency staff. All authorities expect by the end of March to be meeting their statutory duties to inspect children's homes - one in 20 went uninspected last year - but 20 authorities said they would not have the inspectors in post to check on child day-care facilities. Ministers had hoped to respond to the Waterhouse inquiry by pointing to the \u00a3375m Quality Protects programme, and its equivalent in Wales, as evidence that tough new procedures were in place to ensure that abuse on such a scale could never happen again. Social services leaders today say that it \"extremely unlikely\" that organised abuse of the kind practised in some Welsh and English children's homes in the 1970s and 1980s could be easily repeated. The Association of Directors of Social Services says authorities are now far more vigilant. Twenty-five years ago, in an \"age of innocence\", it was barely conceivable that people with an apparent vocation to care for youngsters might secretly aim to abuse them. It is calling for prompt settlement of \"proper\" compensation claims from proven victims of abuse, after the inquiry report is published.

      "bodyText": "The pharmaceutical company which funded a TV advertising campaign urging people suffering from incontinence to seek treatment has been reprimanded for misleading doctors about the drug it sells for the condition. Pharmacia and Upjohn has been found in breach of the industry's code of practice over the advert for the drug Detrusitol in the pages of the British Medical Journal. The advert, aimed at doctors, shows a picture of a smiling older woman in a swimsuit with the caption \"Freed from incontinence\". But Social Audit, the consumer watchdog body which brought the complaint, said the advert was misleading and that it inaccurately implied the drug was a universal panacea.

That was only slightly better than the numbers who were given a placebo (dummy pill) without their knowledge and recovered of their own accord. The prescription medicines code of practice authority has upheld the complaint, ruling that the advert is not \"accurate, balanced, fair, objective and unambiguous\" as required under the code. Pharmacia and Upjohn has undertaken to drop the misleading claims. The television advertising campaign urged people with incontinence to see their doctor for treatment. It did not name a drug - advertising medicines direct to the public is illegal in Britain - and Pharmacia and Upjohn point out that there are several drugs on the market and other forms of treatment, such as exercise, that could be recommended, although Detrutisol is the market leader. The Royal College of Nursing and the Patients Association lent their support on the grounds that incontinence is a taboo subject and many men and women hide themselves away in distress without realising anything can be done. But others saw the commercials as a stalking horse for the sort of advertising of prescription medicines to the public which is permitted in the United States. Disease awareness campaigns paved the way there for a loosening of the regulations and the eventual explicit promotion of branded drugs.

Ex-cheerleader and one-time prodigious drinker/drug user who found fame as Rebecca Howe in alco-sitcom Cheers. Latterly a prominent Scientologist - she's also the spokeswoman for Narcanon, the Church's in-house rehab programme - Alley currently divides her time between lingerie-themed TV show Veronica's Closet and fighting the good fight for L Ron Hubbard: \"I don't like it when journalists mention the 'controversial Church of Scientology' in an article about me\", she remarked in 1998. \"It's like me saying 'the controversial Jew who interviewed me'.\" The role: Lieutenant Saavik, Vulcan prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Captain Spock, aboard the now somewhat delapidated USS Enterprise, battling to save the universe from the sadistic Khan (played by Richard Montalban, otherwise known as Mr Roarke, custodian of TV's Fantasy Island). And, yes, that means she's sporting comically raised eyebrows and pointy ears (albeit tucked under her hair). Best Line: \"Girshon marlon ich vanu. Ich veni... cormay\" (phonetic translation of the Vulcan for \"He's not what I expected. He's so... human.\" Cringe factor: Depends on how you feel about pointy ears. Other wannabes: Young blood being thin on the ground here, the best you'll find is Nicholas Guest - brother of Spinal Tap's Christopher - as a \"Star Fleet Cadet\". Critical judgement: \"A bit hokey and pretentious at times,\" remarked Leonard Maltin, \"but likeable overall, with nice touches of warmth and humour.\" Also not starring in: Champions - the 1983 biopic of jockey Bob Champion - and two episodes of sci-fi TV series The Hitchhiker the same year.

At least My Hero frees him from his dog collar, but he inevitably plays another slow-witted Dubliner, though this time George, the owner of a health-food shop who is in love with a nurse in Northolt. George, though, has a secret. He has a fly-by-night job as Thermoman, a comic-book hero who saves the lives of those in danger and has indeed intervened to rescue the Northolt nurse during her American holiday. </p> <p>You can see how the thinking went. A central element in the success of Father Ted was its surreal sequences and therefore this new O'Hanlon project is designed to have two levels. But Father Ted created an intricate world - Craggy Island, a slightly skewed Ireland - through which recognisably human characters moved. The surrealism was rooted in the superstitions of rural Ireland and the bold leaps of logic asked by the religion which was the central character's job. </p> <p>The problem with My Hero is that the premise is not obviously comic. Imagine being pitched the idea: \"There's this rather dull guy but, in private, he's a superhero who saves the world.\" Well, yes, but that's precisely the plot of Superman and Batman and all the other cartoon strips about the wimp with the hidden heroism.

Although British sit-coms have had American characters before (there was a Yank in Lenny Henry's Chef), My Hero attempts whole scenes of pastiche American sit-com featuring Arnie. The writers weren't to know that the viewer would be able to switch directly from this show to see Friends and Frasier on Channel 4, but the proximity leaves the sit-com needing a superhero to save it. </p> <p>All producers and performers attempting star transplants remember the example of A Year In Provence, the series to which John Thaw moved when Inspector Morse was the nation's favourite programme.

      "bodyText": "Fraud squad officers were last night deciding whether to launch an investigation into the collapsed engineering company founded by the former treasury minister, Geoffrey Robinson. Allegations that government grants totalling hundreds of thousands of pounds were improperly obtained by TransTec have been passed to West Midlands police by Conservative MP John Taylor. The Solihull MP has requested Edward Crew, the chief constable, to launch a full investigation into the alleged abuse of a government funding project. Yesterday the force stressed that no decision had been taken about an investigation, although it said it would liaise with the department of trade and industry. But a Labour MP not known as a Robinson ally said: \"Anyone can complain to the police.\" And one minister played down the significance of Mr Taylor's request: \"It's inconceivable that any police force would begin any investigation until the report of the DTI inspectors who, unlike the police, will have complete and ready access to all the documents.\" News of possible police action came at the end of a weekend during which the former paymaster general's difficulties deepened further, with a string of new allegations about both TransTec and his offshore financial interests. Yesterday Mr Robinson's former business partner Fawzey El-Menshawy, a Birmingham engineer, said he understood that government inspectors had on occasion been hoodwinked when visiting TransTec during the late 1980s to ensure grants for technical innovation had been spent as required. \"They were presented with old machinery and parts dressed up as new,\" he reportedly stated. Elsewhere it was reported that the Belgian tax service, investigating the affairs of Mr Robinson's late benefactor, entrepreneur Joska Bourgeois, had come up against a wall of non-cooperation from the British authorities when requesting information about the Channel Islands trust settled by Mrs Bourgeois on the Robinson family. If true, this would be particularly embarrassing for the government, given that one of Mr Robinson's ministerial duties had been to spearhead a crackdown on tax dodging. Yesterday Mr Taylor said: \"I am very concerned about the effect of the TransTec collapse upon component suppliers in my constituency and the surrounding area. I know others in the local business community are equally alarmed.\" Were the police to take up the case, Mr Robinson - MP for Coventry Northwest - would be facing three separate investigations. DTI inspectors have been appointed to examine the collapse of TransTec and an internal DTI team is investigating claims by TransTec's former accountant Max Ayriss that claims for government grants were inflated in the 1980s. These are the claims Mr Taylor made to Mr Crew: \"If true, I believe these allegations amount to criminal offences,\" the MP said. He called for them to be \"thoroughly investigated by a competent police team, skilled in matters of alleged fraud\". In a statement last night, West Midlands police said: \"We can confirm that we have received a written allegation in relation to the activities of TransTec.

Small and red-headed, she began winning prizes for her designs even as a student. It was an award in 1920 for an allotment design that first brought her into contact with Vienna's Housing movement and the pioneer of modern architecture, Adolf Loos. The collaboration was to have a profound effect on her entire career, and led to significant developments in the design of homes, kindergartens, children's furniture and self-assemble furniture. The influences are still keenly felt; the Swedish furniture store Ikea presented her with an award in the 1990s.</p> <p>The Vienna Housing movement was established because of the huge demand for living space that existed in the Austrian capital at that time. \"Between 1914 and 1918, nothing was built,\" the architect recalled. \"The soldiers came back from the war to find they had no roofs over their heads.\" She joined forces with Loos; the two were convinced of the importance of their task after witnessing angry demonstra tions on Vienna's Ring Road, where thousands of smallholders demanded construction subsidies, land and building materials so they could steer themselves out of poverty.</p> <p>From 1922, Sch\u00fctte-Lihotsky worked with Loos on the first public housing scheme for Austria's war disabled, and their close friendship was to endure until his death in 1933.</p> <p>German architect Ernst May had had his eye on the young Austrian's work for some time, and in 1926 he invited her to join the Frankfurt structural engineering department. Here she was able to concentrate on improving, through simplification, the way household tasks were carried out. Around this time she wrote her first essay: How can we make housework easier by building appropriate apartments? She drew up plans for kindergartens, laundries and apartments, focusing on the needs of single working women. This culminated in the design for the Frankfurt Kitchen, the creation for which she will be most remembered.</p> <p>Ten thousand apartments on a Frankfurt housing estate were kitted out with this design, which had been thought out down to the very last detail. It was the most functional kitchen space that had ever been created on a mass scale - the precursor of the modern fitted version. \"I built the prototype of a 1.9 by 3.4 metre kitchen and I measured with a stop-watch how long it took me to do certain tasks. It has been helping women to save time for years,\" Sch\u00fctte-Lihotsky said.</p> <p>In Frankfurt she met and married her colleague, architect Wilhelm Sch\u00fctte. The couple accepted an invitation, along with Ernst May, to go to the Soviet Union in 1930, where Sch\u00fctte-Lihotsky spent seven years developing standardised designs for kindergartens, nurseries and children's furniture for the newly developed heavy industry cities. She was often based thousands of miles from Moscow in the middle of the steppes, where travel was only possible in horse-drawn carts and sleighs.</p> <p>With the growing strength of Nazi Germany, she decided to demonstrate against the Nazi regime in her homeland. At the end of December 1940 she travelled via Paris and Berlin to Istanbul, where she also worked, before returning to Vienna. There, she linked up with the resistance wing of the Communist party.</p> <p>After only a few weeks she was arrested by the Gestapo. The Berlin national court commuted a recommended death sentence to 15 years in a Bavarian prison, where she stayed until the end of the war. \"During the four years, three months and one week that I served, 16 of around 100 Austrian women who fought for the resistance and who I got to know during this period were murdered - the political prisoners were executed.\" She wrote in detail about the experience in her only book, published in 1985, Memories from the Resistance: the Aggressive Life of an Architect between 1938 and 1945. Returning to post-war Austria, the self-professed Marxist found herself to be virtually persona non grata.</p> <p>For years she found success only abroad. She was particularly popular in the Soviet Union, but it was not until 1980 that Austria began to start recognising her talents, awarding her the Vienna City Prize for Architecture; whole-hearted acceptance of her achievements only arrived after the end of Kurt Waldheim's presidency in 1992, when her country started to come to terms with its past.</p> <p>In 1988, Sch\u00fctte-Lihotsky refused to accept the Austrian Honorary Medal for Science and Art from Waldheim; she finally received the prize some years later. More recently, she criticised Austria's acceptance of far-right leader J\u00f6rg Haider, saying that people forgot their past too easily; she predicted correctly that \"in the next election, his party will make great gains.\"</p> <p>In 1993, Vienna's Museum of Applied Arts held an exhibition exploring her life and career - the first and only such celebration of her work in a mainstream forum. Five years later, in what was to be one of her last undertakings, Sch\u00fctte-Lihotsky oversaw a project for a housing estate in north-east Vienna designed for women by women - the largest project of its kind in Europe. On her 100th birthday Vienna authorities announced that the estate would be renamed after her in recognition of an outstanding contribution to the city spanning more than a century. In the last few years of her life Sch\u00fctte-Lihotsky lived alone, a stone's throw from her birthplace, in a small Vienna apartment with her cat, walking 700 steps every day to the local delicatessen. \"I measure all distances in steps,\" she said. \"I can't help it - I'll be an architect until my dying day.\"</p> <p>Margarete Sch\u00fctte-Lihotsky, architect, born January 23 1897; died January 18 2000</p>",

This culminated in the design for the Frankfurt Kitchen, the creation for which she will be most remembered. Ten thousand apartments on a Frankfurt housing estate were kitted out with this design, which had been thought out down to the very last detail. It was the most functional kitchen space that had ever been created on a mass scale - the precursor of the modern fitted version. \"I built the prototype of a 1.9 by 3.4 metre kitchen and I measured with a stop-watch how long it took me to do certain tasks. It has been helping women to save time for years,\" Sch\u00fctte-Lihotsky said. In Frankfurt she met and married her colleague, architect Wilhelm Sch\u00fctte. The couple accepted an invitation, along with Ernst May, to go to the Soviet Union in 1930, where Sch\u00fctte-Lihotsky spent seven years developing standardised designs for kindergartens, nurseries and children's furniture for the newly developed heavy industry cities. She was often based thousands of miles from Moscow in the middle of the steppes, where travel was only possible in horse-drawn carts and sleighs. With the growing strength of Nazi Germany, she decided to demonstrate against the Nazi regime in her homeland. At the end of December 1940 she travelled via Paris and Berlin to Istanbul, where she also worked, before returning to Vienna. There, she linked up with the resistance wing of the Communist party. After only a few weeks she was arrested by the Gestapo. The Berlin national court commuted a recommended death sentence to 15 years in a Bavarian prison, where she stayed until the end of the war. \"During the four years, three months and one week that I served, 16 of around 100 Austrian women who fought for the resistance and who I got to know during this period were murdered - the political prisoners were executed.\" She wrote in detail about the experience in her only book, published in 1985, Memories from the Resistance: the Aggressive Life of an Architect between 1938 and 1945. Returning to post-war Austria, the self-professed Marxist found herself to be virtually persona non grata. For years she found success only abroad. She was particularly popular in the Soviet Union, but it was not until 1980 that Austria began to start recognising her talents, awarding her the Vienna City Prize for Architecture; whole-hearted acceptance of her achievements only arrived after the end of Kurt Waldheim's presidency in 1992, when her country started to come to terms with its past. In 1988, Sch\u00fctte-Lihotsky refused to accept the Austrian Honorary Medal for Science and Art from Waldheim; she finally received the prize some years later. More recently, she criticised Austria's acceptance of far-right leader J\u00f6rg Haider, saying that people forgot their past too easily; she predicted correctly that \"in the next election, his party will make great gains.\" In 1993, Vienna's Museum of Applied Arts held an exhibition exploring her life and career - the first and only such celebration of her work in a mainstream forum. Five years later, in what was to be one of her last undertakings, Sch\u00fctte-Lihotsky oversaw a project for a housing estate in north-east Vienna designed for women by women - the largest project of its kind in Europe. On her 100th birthday Vienna authorities announced that the estate would be renamed after her in recognition of an outstanding contribution to the city spanning more than a century. In the last few years of her life Sch\u00fctte-Lihotsky lived alone, a stone's throw from her birthplace, in a small Vienna apartment with her cat, walking 700 steps every day to the local delicatessen. \"I measure all distances in steps,\" she said. \"I can't help it - I'll be an architect until my dying day.\" Margarete Sch\u00fctte-Lihotsky, architect, born January 23 1897; died January 18 2000",

      "body": "<p>Kenyan police were last night searching for a British man who is accused of peddling an illegal treatment for Aids, which is ravaging the country. He is also wanted for probation violations in the United States.</p> <p>Basil Wainwright, who has served prison terms for fraud in the US and Britain - where he was convicted of defrauding the television presenter Noel Edmonds - has been charging terminally ill patients in Kenya thousands of pounds.</p> <p>Mr Wainwright claims to have cured 371 HIV-positive patients since 1996.</p> <p>But Richard Muga, Kenya's director of medical services, said: \"This man is a conman of the highest order.\"</p> <p>Mr Wainwright, also known as Roderick E Stone, came to Kenya in July 1996. Claiming that he could cure Aids, and that he enjoyed patronage from the highest echelons of the Kenyan government, he set up clinics and began administering his treatment, which he calls \"polyatomic apheresis\". It involves injecting ozone into a patient's bloodstream.</p> <p>According to the country's ministry of health, more than 750,000 Kenyans out of a population of 30m have died of Aids, and a further 1.9m are infected with the HIV virus.</p> <p>Mr Wainwright was given a temporary licence to practise on condition that he was providing his services freely and on a charitable basis. But in December 1996, when it emerged that he was charging huge sums of money for the treatment, this permission was rescinded.</p> <p>A detailed investigation into Mr Wainwright's practices led the ministry of health to impose a comprehensive ban on the treatment in July 1998.</p> <p>\"Wainwright is a fraud who preys on the desperation of the terminally ill,\" said JW Nyikal, who led the medical authority's investigation.</p> <p>\"Wainwright is charming, and undoubtedly very reassuring to the sick - but the man has a criminal record, his method is suspect and he has no medical qualifications. What does he think he is doing practising medicine in Kenya?\"</p> <p>But Mr Wainwright continued administering his treatment. Last week medical officers raided a house in the coastal town of Mombasa after receiving information that Mr Wainwright was operating a clinic there.</p> <p>Peter Kimuu, the district medical officer who led the raid, claimed Mr Wainwright and his associates had been tipped off and had removed records and equipment from the premises in advance.</p> <p>\"When we entered the house we found a room with 10 beds and oxygen equipment which was clearly a ward. There is no doubt in my mind that Wainwright and his associates were administering the outlawed ozone treatment there.\"</p> <p>The authorities questioned a nurse, Elizabeth Karanja, who was in the house at the time of the raid and who admitted she was an employee of Mr Wainwright's.</p> <p>Ms Karanja confirmed that they had been treating Aids patients in the house and that equipment and records had indeed been recently removed.</p> <p>She said that most of the patients had been foreigners, including some Europeans.</p> <p>Some of Mr Wainwright's former patients have revealed that he charges up to \u00a323,470 for treatment. Patients are also required to sign a waiver absolving Mr Wainwright and his team of any liability.</p> <p>It emerged yesterday that Mr Wainwright is heavily in debt, and one creditor, a Nairobi restaurant owner, said he had initiated legal proceedings against him.</p> <p>A spokesman for the British high commission in Nairobi said: \"We are aware of the case and are following it closely. We are particularly concerned at allegations of two different passports held in different names.\"</p> <p>He said British authorities had informed Kenyan medical authorities in 1997 that Interpol had a file on the man.</p> <p>Mr Wainwright was convicted and sentenced to a three-year prison term in Britain in 1983 on 22 charges of theft, forgery and false accounting. He swindled Edmonds out of \u00a370,000.</p> <p>After his release from prison he heard of the alleged medical properties of ozone - an activated form of oxygen that its proponents claim is capable of cleansing the blood of viruses.</p> <p>Although variants of ozone therapy have been in use since the late 19th century its effectiveness in treating viruses has never been established.</p> <p>In the late 1980s Mr Wainwright moved to Florida, where he sold his homemade ozone delivery systems. In 1990 he was sentenced to four years in prison for running an unlicensed medical practice.</p> <p>The US embassy in Nairobi said he was wanted for alleged probation violations.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Kenyan police were last night searching for a British man who is accused of peddling an illegal treatment for Aids, which is ravaging the country. He is also wanted for probation violations in the United States. Basil Wainwright, who has served prison terms for fraud in the US and Britain - where he was convicted of defrauding the television presenter Noel Edmonds - has been charging terminally ill patients in Kenya thousands of pounds. Mr Wainwright claims to have cured 371 HIV-positive patients since 1996. But Richard Muga, Kenya's director of medical services, said: \"This man is a conman of the highest order.\" Mr Wainwright, also known as Roderick E Stone, came to Kenya in July 1996. Claiming that he could cure Aids, and that he enjoyed patronage from the highest echelons of the Kenyan government, he set up clinics and began administering his treatment, which he calls \"polyatomic apheresis\". It involves injecting ozone into a patient's bloodstream. According to the country's ministry of health, more than 750,000 Kenyans out of a population of 30m have died of Aids, and a further 1.9m are infected with the HIV virus. Mr Wainwright was given a temporary licence to practise on condition that he was providing his services freely and on a charitable basis. But in December 1996, when it emerged that he was charging huge sums of money for the treatment, this permission was rescinded. A detailed investigation into Mr Wainwright's practices led the ministry of health to impose a comprehensive ban on the treatment in July 1998. \"Wainwright is a fraud who preys on the desperation of the terminally ill,\" said JW Nyikal, who led the medical authority's investigation. \"Wainwright is charming, and undoubtedly very reassuring to the sick - but the man has a criminal record, his method is suspect and he has no medical qualifications. What does he think he is doing practising medicine in Kenya?\" But Mr Wainwright continued administering his treatment. Last week medical officers raided a house in the coastal town of Mombasa after receiving information that Mr Wainwright was operating a clinic there. Peter Kimuu, the district medical officer who led the raid, claimed Mr Wainwright and his associates had been tipped off and had removed records and equipment from the premises in advance. \"When we entered the house we found a room with 10 beds and oxygen equipment which was clearly a ward. There is no doubt in my mind that Wainwright and his associates were administering the outlawed ozone treatment there.\" The authorities questioned a nurse, Elizabeth Karanja, who was in the house at the time of the raid and who admitted she was an employee of Mr Wainwright's. Ms Karanja confirmed that they had been treating Aids patients in the house and that equipment and records had indeed been recently removed. She said that most of the patients had been foreigners, including some Europeans. Some of Mr Wainwright's former patients have revealed that he charges up to \u00a323,470 for treatment. Patients are also required to sign a waiver absolving Mr Wainwright and his team of any liability. It emerged yesterday that Mr Wainwright is heavily in debt, and one creditor, a Nairobi restaurant owner, said he had initiated legal proceedings against him. A spokesman for the British high commission in Nairobi said: \"We are aware of the case and are following it closely. We are particularly concerned at allegations of two different passports held in different names.\" He said British authorities had informed Kenyan medical authorities in 1997 that Interpol had a file on the man. Mr Wainwright was convicted and sentenced to a three-year prison term in Britain in 1983 on 22 charges of theft, forgery and false accounting. He swindled Edmonds out of \u00a370,000. After his release from prison he heard of the alleged medical properties of ozone - an activated form of oxygen that its proponents claim is capable of cleansing the blood of viruses. Although variants of ozone therapy have been in use since the late 19th century its effectiveness in treating viruses has never been established. In the late 1980s Mr Wainwright moved to Florida, where he sold his homemade ozone delivery systems. In 1990 he was sentenced to four years in prison for running an unlicensed medical practice. The US embassy in Nairobi said he was wanted for alleged probation violations.",

      "bodyText": "The issue of how much freedom should be given to the extreme right is high on the political agenda throughout the German-speaking world today after a weekend in which there were dramatic moves in opposing directions. The publicly-funded German television network, ARD, yesterday unexpectedly withdrew an invitation to the far right Austrian leader J\u00f6rg Haider to appear on a leading talk show. The move came after hundreds of neo-Nazis were allowed to march through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin - the first such display since the fall of the Third Reich. Mr Haider had been scheduled to appear in a debate with Daniel Cohn-Bendit - \"Danny the Red\" of the 1968 Paris students' revolt - Germany's interior minister, Otto Schily, and the deputy leader of the Jewish community, Michel Friedman. But, in a statement faxed to news organisations, ARD indicated that the other participants had threatened to withdraw if Mr Haider, whose party is negotiating to enter the government in Austria, was among the guests. The statement added: \"We still believe that it is better that rightwing populists like Haider should be engaged in discussion rather than ignored or isolated. \"But our conditions have always been that leading representatives of Jewish organisations and German government should sit opposite him. After this proved unrealistic, despite promises, the editors of the show came to their decision.\" It was not clear whether the channel or its guests had come under pressure from the authorities. But the chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, said in remarks published yesterday: \"Developments in Austria fill me with concern.\" His views, in an interview with the rightwing tabloid Bild am Sonntag, were clearly aimed at the section of the population in which sympathy for Mr Haider's anti-immigrant views is strongest. Mr Schr\u00f6der's government has been moving in the opposite direction, taking steps to naturalise a large part of Germany's immigrant community. All concerned with the Haider interview seem to have been wrong-footed by the decision late on Friday to let the neo-Nazis stage their demonstration. A court in Berlin overruled a ban imposed by the police, saying that freedom of speech should take priority. The protest was the most extreme expression so far of the backlash in several parts of Europe against recent events to commemorate the Holo caust. It was called to protest against a national monument honouring Jews who were murdered under the Third Reich. On Thursday, German Jewish leaders and politicians, including Mr Schr\u00f6der, dedicated a tract of land in the centre of Berlin on which a maze of concrete pillars resembling a huge graveyard is to be built. About 600 neo-Nazis gathered at the site on Saturday to hear Udo Voigt, the chairman of the fringe National Democratic party (NPD), describe the project as \"an undesirable stain on the Reich capital\". Around 500 Germans shouting \"Nazis out\" staged a counter protest nearby. Police briefly detained about 25 neo-Nazis when they started singing SS songs, but riot police kept the two groups well apart and only one scuffle occurred. To get to their destination, however, the neo-Nazis marched through the Brandenburg Gate in an act reminiscent of the processions through the triumphal arch which were staged under Hitler.

To mark the occasion, the governor of the southern province of Carinthia handed out 5,000 ski passes to party members, friends and journalists, proving once again his ability to tap into Austria's psyche by milking its obsession with snow sports. The invitations had billed Saturday's \u00a3500,000 celebration, held on the summit of the Gerlitzen mountain range, as \"the biggest party the region has ever experienced\". Mr Haider, whose party has edged ever closer to power in the past couple of weeks, was taking a day off from coalition talks with the conservative People's party.

Mr Haider joined in the singing of traditional folk songs and even took the microphone himself to sing a ballad about a shepherd leaving his alpine pasture for warmer climes as winter sets in. But he was interrupted as four sunshine-yellow Austrian air force planes made a fly-past in tribute to him. The head pilot, a friend of Mr Haider's, later told the crowds: \"I hope we symbolise a new wind sweeping through our country.\" Blue, the Freedom party's official colour, dominated the day - blue balloons marked with his trademark signature \"J\u00f6rg\" hung in the bare trees; the snowmobile that transported non-skiers was Freedom party-blue; blue sashes were attached to the beams of the huts, and the predominantly young crowd ate a barbecued mix of scrambled egg and pork from blue frying pans. The similarly hued flag of the EU was stuck in the snow tucked away behind the mountain hut. \"It doesn't have a place here at all,\" one Haider supporter said.

      "body": "<p>Jonathan Cainer (Sagittarius) Britain's highest earning astrologer, usually smokes a pipe. \"But the truth is,\" he says, drawing sharply on a Camel Light, \"you cannot smoke a pipe in crisis. Normally it fits perfectly well - getting into a meditative state, looking at what the planets are doing, you light your pipe and you think\" - he closes his eyes and nods his head back and forth - \"Hmm, what shall I say for Aries today?\" He opens them again and bangs the packet on the table. \"But dealing with lawyers and on the phone and crisis meetings, I haven't got time for a pipe. It's, ' Find me some fags, quick .' \"</p> <p>Cainer, 42, is having a mad time at the moment. He's a chain-smoking newspaper man these days, not a mystic. Though hopefully things will settle down now. Today he finally joins the Express after a month of legal wrangling with his former employers the Daily Mail. He decided to leave in December after a scrap relating to his highly lucrative phone lines. He was on a 50-50 deal with them, which added an extra \u00a3500,000 to his annual \u00a380,000 basic. He needed a bit of leeway on this. \"I wanted to say, 'Guys, freeze your current income levels and let me expand things, tarot lines, that sort of stuff. And they just demonstrated an attitude to me. I could almost hear the pat on the head, 'Look, run along little astrologer, we're busy.' \"</p> <p>So he ran along to Rosie Boycott (Taurean - \"typically stubborn\") at the Express, who was just off to deliver a bread oven to Bosnia. \"And I thought: 'Oh damn, I was going to try really hard to drive a big financial deal and now she's got me. I'm going to have to work for her now.'\" He's always been a Guardian man anyway and working for the Mail had been seven years of \"sticking up a voice for reason\", of trying to \"counterbalance\" the prejudices of the rest of the paper. \"There was a classic occasion when the Mail went rabid over Redwood. You didn't have to be an astrologer to see he was a long shot. There was one glorious day when the whole Mail was dedicated to Redwood this, Redwood that and finally you get to the horoscope page, right at the back of the book, and there tucked away next to the cartoon was a little lone voice saying the man hasn't got a chance. After that I got a bit more respect from them.\"</p> <p>The Mail didn't want him to go - \"Horoscopes sell papers,\" says Cainer - and when the offer of a \u00a31m salary plus another \u00a31m bonus didn't wash, they threatened to sue him for breach of contract. He'd have gone to prison he says, but luckily he hasn't had to. He's writing in the Express for free. \"Though I get to keep my phone lines. Basically Jonathan Cainer can set up his stall. I'm coming but I keep my licensing and marketing rights.\" He gives a broad Cheshire-cat grin, in which his very white replacement top teeth seem to glint in the light. \"If all this attention translates into hard cash, I've cracked it.\"</p> <p>To visit Jonathan Cainer, a stocky man in a crumpled suit with a bald head and a steady, dark-eyed stare, at his headquarters (25 employees, mainly women, mainly long-haired) in the centre of York, is to enter a world in which the sky is ecliptic, the house system is porphyry and the lunar node is mean. You can't be sensitive here without being \"extraordinarily intuitive\", you can't have a temper without it \"erupting into a supernova\". There is a shop front where you can get a quickie horoscope printout (\u00a33.99) and a bag of powdered myrrh and there is \"out the back\" from where the internet site (worth \u00a350m) is run and the phone lines are organised and the mail order business is managed and the personal profiles (\u00a322) are sent out. My heavy-bound, 35-page astrological report takes four minutes to produce. \"Er... normally we try and conceal how quickly these are done,\" says Cainer.</p> <p>He gives you a lot of blurb about planetary positions, but he's the first to admit that he's got Mercury in Capricorn which \"blesses you with the ability to sound like you know what you're talking about even when you're spouting rubbish\". He is also likeably frank about his profession. \"Let's be clear about this. I believe in astrology. Astrology is a belief system, not an art or a science, though there is a bit of art and science chucked in, and I am a true subscriber to that belief. But my belief system gets a bit stretched when I find myself in the game of forecasting for a 12th of the population.\"</p> <p>Star signs, he says, are not what it's about, but if you are involved in the \"commercial side of things\", if you have \"sold out and are standing there naked doing ridiculous things\", you might as well do it properly. \"I have a formula that I never deviate from. If you work on the basis that life is tough but never mind, one of these days it will take a turn for the better, you can't go wrong. If you turn to most people and acknowledge the fact that they're having a crap time, you'll find very few people who'll say, 'No, I'm not.' You read your horoscope when your partner's splitting up from you, when your domestic life is crap. You look at your horoscope because you're desperate, you'll look anywhere. So to that extent it makes no difference what sign you are, or where the planets are. My job is to be philosophical and to offer encouragement, to say, 'Look, when you're in a rough period, learn through it.' Lucy the five cents psychoanalyst from Peanuts. I am that Lucy, yes.\"</p> <p>As for the lucrative phone lines, he says: \"Look, what are they? Glorified answering machines. Twelve. One for Aries, Taurus... With lots of lines going in. That's all they blooming well are. The overheads are bugger all. The costs are bugger all. And you can buy the equipment for less than 25 grand. That's a hell of a big profit margin...\"</p> <p>Cainer hasn't always been an astrologer. He was born in Surbiton but when his parents split up when he was 13, he went to live in Leeds with his mother (once a medical secretary, now a spiritual healer) and twin brothers, and soon dropped out of school to become a petrol attendant. He was in a band called Strange Cloud before, \"fancying myself a bit of an entrepreneur\", he fetched up in LA. Here he touted his brother around as a singer, managed a nightclub and met a pyschic poet called Charles John Quatro. Back in England, he lived on \"this glorious thing called social security\" and studied at the Faculty of Astrological Studies in London. His first astrological job was at Today - which he also left in a phone line dispute. \"I've been making money from them for a long time. I don't know if people know that. Well, the tax man certainly knows.\" At that point a small object whizzes past my ear and makes me jump. It's a 50p piece that had been balancing on the top of the sofa. Cainer laughs, \"That's what happens if you sit around here. Money falls on to you.\"</p> <p>Horoscopes and money. Money and horoscopes. It is hard, in conversation with Cainer, to disentangle the two. Until you start talking personally. In 1992, Cainer's wife, Melanie, died in surgery after a car crash. \"She popped out to the shops and had an altercation with a lorry,\" he says in an attempt at frivolity. He didn't get to see her in hospital after the accident because he was at home looking after the seven children they had between them, including two still breast-fed seven-month twins. \"My favourite song,\" he says: \"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille.\" You realise when he talks about this how bluff he tends to be even on subjects that are close to him.</p> <p>And then suddenly he reports a conversation he had with Melanie, after the accident. I look puzzled. And he says, \"Oh yeah, I was serving tea to the kids and suddenly - sound and vision in the corner of the room. It was Mel in a strange blue light, looking serene. She said: 'Jon I think I'm going...' I said: 'No you're not, I need you here.' She said: 'No, no I think I am...' So I wasn't too surprised when the doctor later told me she'd died in surgery. I said I thought as much.\"</p> <p>Did you really say that? \"Maybe I didn't. I've learnt you have to be careful how much you tell people about the communications with the dead. Everyone assumes you're a bit of a nutter, but sorry, I have. I've had innumerable conversations with her since.\" He's got a locked room at his house with all her things in it. He made a housing for the bins where she wanted it. He painted the bathroom the colour blue she chose. He looks down at his hands. \"She only really moved further away when I got help with childcare,\" he adds sadly.</p> <p>He's had \"light relationships - plural\" since, but nothing serious. \"I'm quite sure I'll never get married again.\" Has he looked at his chart to check? \"Absolutely not, I hate having my fortune told. I loathe and detest being told by anybody what the stars have in store for me. Anyway,\" he leans forward and shouts into the microphone, \"Astrologers can't read the future. Astrologers can't read the future. Astrologers can't read the future.\"</p> <p>He sits back and says again quietly, in a normal voice, \"No I'm quite sure I'll never get married again.\" He says it with no bluster, no mysticism. Typical Sagittarius.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jonathan Cainer (Sagittarius) Britain's highest earning astrologer, usually smokes a pipe. \"But the truth is,\" he says, drawing sharply on a Camel Light, \"you cannot smoke a pipe in crisis. Normally it fits perfectly well - getting into a meditative state, looking at what the planets are doing, you light your pipe and you think\" - he closes his eyes and nods his head back and forth - \"Hmm, what shall I say for Aries today?\" He opens them again and bangs the packet on the table. \"But dealing with lawyers and on the phone and crisis meetings, I haven't got time for a pipe. It's, ' Find me some fags, quick .' \" Cainer, 42, is having a mad time at the moment. He's a chain-smoking newspaper man these days, not a mystic. Though hopefully things will settle down now. Today he finally joins the Express after a month of legal wrangling with his former employers the Daily Mail. He decided to leave in December after a scrap relating to his highly lucrative phone lines. He was on a 50-50 deal with them, which added an extra \u00a3500,000 to his annual \u00a380,000 basic. He needed a bit of leeway on this. \"I wanted to say, 'Guys, freeze your current income levels and let me expand things, tarot lines, that sort of stuff. And they just demonstrated an attitude to me. I could almost hear the pat on the head, 'Look, run along little astrologer, we're busy.' \" So he ran along to Rosie Boycott (Taurean - \"typically stubborn\") at the Express, who was just off to deliver a bread oven to Bosnia. \"And I thought: 'Oh damn, I was going to try really hard to drive a big financial deal and now she's got me. I'm going to have to work for her now.'\" He's always been a Guardian man anyway and working for the Mail had been seven years of \"sticking up a voice for reason\", of trying to \"counterbalance\" the prejudices of the rest of the paper. \"There was a classic occasion when the Mail went rabid over Redwood. You didn't have to be an astrologer to see he was a long shot. There was one glorious day when the whole Mail was dedicated to Redwood this, Redwood that and finally you get to the horoscope page, right at the back of the book, and there tucked away next to the cartoon was a little lone voice saying the man hasn't got a chance. After that I got a bit more respect from them.\" The Mail didn't want him to go - \"Horoscopes sell papers,\" says Cainer - and when the offer of a \u00a31m salary plus another \u00a31m bonus didn't wash, they threatened to sue him for breach of contract. He'd have gone to prison he says, but luckily he hasn't had to. He's writing in the Express for free. \"Though I get to keep my phone lines. Basically Jonathan Cainer can set up his stall. I'm coming but I keep my licensing and marketing rights.\" He gives a broad Cheshire-cat grin, in which his very white replacement top teeth seem to glint in the light. \"If all this attention translates into hard cash, I've cracked it.\" To visit Jonathan Cainer, a stocky man in a crumpled suit with a bald head and a steady, dark-eyed stare, at his headquarters (25 employees, mainly women, mainly long-haired) in the centre of York, is to enter a world in which the sky is ecliptic, the house system is porphyry and the lunar node is mean. You can't be sensitive here without being \"extraordinarily intuitive\", you can't have a temper without it \"erupting into a supernova\". There is a shop front where you can get a quickie horoscope printout (\u00a33.99) and a bag of powdered myrrh and there is \"out the back\" from where the internet site (worth \u00a350m) is run and the phone lines are organised and the mail order business is managed and the personal profiles (\u00a322) are sent out. My heavy-bound, 35-page astrological report takes four minutes to produce. \"Er... normally we try and conceal how quickly these are done,\" says Cainer. He gives you a lot of blurb about planetary positions, but he's the first to admit that he's got Mercury in Capricorn which \"blesses you with the ability to sound like you know what you're talking about even when you're spouting rubbish\". He is also likeably frank about his profession. \"Let's be clear about this. I believe in astrology. Astrology is a belief system, not an art or a science, though there is a bit of art and science chucked in, and I am a true subscriber to that belief. But my belief system gets a bit stretched when I find myself in the game of forecasting for a 12th of the population.\" Star signs, he says, are not what it's about, but if you are involved in the \"commercial side of things\", if you have \"sold out and are standing there naked doing ridiculous things\", you might as well do it properly. \"I have a formula that I never deviate from. If you work on the basis that life is tough but never mind, one of these days it will take a turn for the better, you can't go wrong. If you turn to most people and acknowledge the fact that they're having a crap time, you'll find very few people who'll say, 'No, I'm not.' You read your horoscope when your partner's splitting up from you, when your domestic life is crap. You look at your horoscope because you're desperate, you'll look anywhere. So to that extent it makes no difference what sign you are, or where the planets are. My job is to be philosophical and to offer encouragement, to say, 'Look, when you're in a rough period, learn through it.' Lucy the five cents psychoanalyst from Peanuts. I am that Lucy, yes.\" As for the lucrative phone lines, he says: \"Look, what are they? Glorified answering machines. Twelve. One for Aries, Taurus... With lots of lines going in. That's all they blooming well are. The overheads are bugger all. The costs are bugger all. And you can buy the equipment for less than 25 grand. That's a hell of a big profit margin...\" Cainer hasn't always been an astrologer. He was born in Surbiton but when his parents split up when he was 13, he went to live in Leeds with his mother (once a medical secretary, now a spiritual healer) and twin brothers, and soon dropped out of school to become a petrol attendant. He was in a band called Strange Cloud before, \"fancying myself a bit of an entrepreneur\", he fetched up in LA. Here he touted his brother around as a singer, managed a nightclub and met a pyschic poet called Charles John Quatro. Back in England, he lived on \"this glorious thing called social security\" and studied at the Faculty of Astrological Studies in London. His first astrological job was at Today - which he also left in a phone line dispute. \"I've been making money from them for a long time. I don't know if people know that. Well, the tax man certainly knows.\" At that point a small object whizzes past my ear and makes me jump. It's a 50p piece that had been balancing on the top of the sofa. Cainer laughs, \"That's what happens if you sit around here. Money falls on to you.\" Horoscopes and money. Money and horoscopes. It is hard, in conversation with Cainer, to disentangle the two. Until you start talking personally. In 1992, Cainer's wife, Melanie, died in surgery after a car crash. \"She popped out to the shops and had an altercation with a lorry,\" he says in an attempt at frivolity. He didn't get to see her in hospital after the accident because he was at home looking after the seven children they had between them, including two still breast-fed seven-month twins. \"My favourite song,\" he says: \"You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille.\" You realise when he talks about this how bluff he tends to be even on subjects that are close to him.

They fingered a capitalized cultural artifact known as \"Nature\". Sport-ute owners apparently want to consume nature as well as metal. Or more precisely, the image of nature as drummed home in endless commercials: utes by deep-woods waterfalls, utes atop mountain ranges, utes by pristine lakes.</p> <p>Successful marketing could be defined as the victory of fantasy over reality, and sport-ute marketing is a classic example. How else can you sell something that endangers the environment in the name of worshipping it?</p> <p>Not that ute owners actually do go in much for the wilderness. That's the good news. Even in the furthest wilds of the American west - Seattle and San Francisco and Los Angeles - they spend their lives as urban and suburban cruisers.</p> <p>This makes sense. Unless the vehicles in question are OPC (other people's cars, driven mainly by testosterone-happy soldiers and members of the automotive press), what fool is going to take a $40,000 vehicle off-road and risk getting the paintwork scratched or the suspension banged up? Even manufacturers admit that only 3% of their customers ever take their utes off-road. Discount gravel driveways, and it's under 1%.</p> <p>In fact, there's little either sporty or utilitarian about sport-utes. True, watching a driver trying to manoeuvre one into a supermarket parking spot is a new form of spectator sport. And I suppose using a ute to drop the kids off at school could be considered a tad more utilitarian than using a Ferrari. But the only thing that really makes them sporty is the element of risk.</p> <p>No rugged outdoorsman or incipient wildwoman would want to forgo risk, of course, and sport-utes oblige extravagantly. Watch the news coverage of the next snow or ice storm, and see the utes doing 360s in the middle of the road.</p> <p>Or take one onto a slalom course to test its maker's claim of \"car-like handling,\" as I did once, and find out what it's like to try to induce an elephant to tango. The ute wallowed spectacularly through every turn, listing alarmingly. I'm not sure whether it was physics or fear that made me feel sick.</p> <p>Seduced by the joy of riding high in what car salesmen call \"the master driving position,\" ute owners tend to enter whole hog into the big-bad-and-dangerous-to-know thing. \"Anyone else had better keep out of my way and not mess with me,\" crowed one Land Cruiser-wielding lawyer in my mild hometown of Seattle, \"because I'm bigger than they are.\" She's five-foot-four.

Still, if you manage to stay upright, there is something to the invulnerability thing. Because now comes the clincher to my conspiracy theory: in a crash, the heavier vehicle tends to inflict the damage, the lighter vehicle to suffer it - especially when the heavier vehicle has bumpers that ride high over the lighter one's, thus ramming straight into the passenger compartment. Two or three tons of ute colliding with one ton of mini is what's called an uneven contest. If you're in the mini, you'll pay the price for the ute-owner's addiction to size. Statistics show that when cars and utes collide, 80% of the fatalities are in the cars.</p> <p>This may make the sport-ute the most psychopathic vehicle yet invented for civilian use.

      "bodyText": "Time was, I'd joke about sport-utes - that army of descendants of the once-modest military jeep, gone upscale and urban chic. At least, I thought I was joking. \"It's a conspiracy,\" I'd say. \"It's all a plot to get us to spend more on new metal. Make us turn in our cars and buy something bigger and more expensive. Use more petrol and pay more insurance and spend more on repairs.\" That was 10 years ago. Since then, sport-utes (aka sport-utility vehicles, SUVs, or \"utes\" for short) have spawned at so alarming a rate that many people here in the US are buying them in self-defence. It's either get into one yourself, or be condemned to drive surrounded by them on the road, feeling more and more ant-like by the minute. The next thing you know, you're paying $40,000 (\u00a325,000) for a $20,000 pickup truck with at most $1,000 of extra metal, seating, and carpeting. Now I hear that the invasion has reached across the Atlantic, where you don't even have the excuse that petrol is only a fifth the price of Evian water. So allow me to offer a few words of gentle warning before you write your annual cheque to Greenpeace and then drive to the supermarket in a three-ton, four-wheel-drive vehicle that does 10 miles to the gallon and handles like a tank.

How else can you sell something that endangers the environment in the name of worshipping it? Not that ute owners actually do go in much for the wilderness. That's the good news.

      "body": "<p>Away from the brouhaha surrounding the dome and the noisy fluster of a public relations industry working its socks off to promote the gaggle of new cultural venues opening this year, the restoration of London's magnificent Somerset House has been developing apace in quiet, stately fashion. Facing the Strand to the north and the Thames to the south, this grand Palladian civic palace will surprise and delight the millions of locals and tourists who will pass it on the way to work, the West End and well known monuments when it opens to the public in May. It will be one of Britain's finest cultural venues and an example of how, across the country, we might begin to rethink the way we use public buildings, public space and the public realm. </p> <p>Designed by Sir William Chambers (1723-96), architectural advisor and tutor to King George III, Somerset House was built between 1776 and 1801 to house various government offices and learned societies. Among these were the Navy, Stamp and Salt offices alongside the newly founded Royal Academy of Arts (since removed to Burlington House, Piccadilly). The vast courtyard building was, in effect, the first government office block in London and probably the first purpose-built office in Britain. </p> <p>For too many years it has been a home to civil servants - the Inland Revenue in particular - who seem to have been heedless of its Classical charms. The corridors and individual offices within were things of Men-from-the-Ministry austerity, if not squalor; the grand central courtyard was made over as no more than a car park, while the breathtaking riverside terrace was inaccessible to the public and largely unused. </p> <p>The Somerset House Trust, a committee of the grand and architecturally minded under the chairmanship of Sir Timothy Sainsbury, was formed in June 1997. Its aim was to turn this warren of civil servant burrows, this mammoth exhibition of filing cabinets and memoranda in triplicate, this palace of more than 1,000 rooms, into a \"major new visitor attraction for London, and a new centre for culture and the arts\". The government granted the trust a 128-year lease that autumn, and work began. The necessary works were expected to take 10 years; in fact they will have taken just three and cost \u00a348m - \u00a312m less than the subsidy apparently needed to keep the \u00a3758m Greenwich dome all at sea. </p> <p>The results are very likely to please everyone who steps into the great courtyard this spring. To their further delight, visitors will find that they can keep walking across the courtyard, under arches, on to the riverside terrace, across the Thames to Sir Giles Gilbert Scott's supremely elegant Waterloo, and so to the South Bank Centre, which will soon be improved considerably by the architect-planner Rick Mather. More than a new cultural centre and visitor attraction, here is an inspirational walk through the centre of London, connecting Covent Garden to Waterloo through Neo-Classical architectural splendour. </p> <p>The trust sees the vast courtyard (40,000 sq ft) as an area of repose during the day from the hurly-burly of the major streets that flank Somerset House and, by night, as a place of intelligent entertainment (capacity 3,500 people). A new 55-jet fountain designed by Dixon Jones, architects of the revamped Royal Opera House, will play at the centre of this great space. The jets can be choreographed and would make a superb backdrop to, say, a performance of Handel's Water Music, a Thames-side piece composed not long before Chambers began work on Somerset House. Concerts, music festivals, opera, theatre, dance and open air films will oust the blare of car engines and exhaust pipes that has been the staple sound of the courtyard for many years. </p> <p>The transformation of Somerset House is a model for both urban conservation programmes and new city development, a judgment that can be made from the treatment of the great courtyard alone. There are several such spaces the length and breadth of Britain that have been given over to uncategorisable detritus and the car over the past 50 years and could be similarly improved. </p> <p>Beyond the courtyard are the Embankment and South Buildings, restored and converted by the meticulous Peter Inskip and Peter Jenkins, and now housing the Gilbert collection of historic decorative arts. From the autumn, selections from the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg, will also be displayed in part of the South Building. This makes impressive sense. Somerset House is built on a heroic scale to compete with that of the bombastic Russian palace, while cultural links forged with the Russian government are more than valuable at a time when diplomacy and good will are needed to keep relations between Moscow and the west on something like an even keel. </p> <p>The River Terrace, aside from eye-boggling views of the Thames and the architecture - good, bad and ugly - that lines its banks, offers a cafe designed by Dixon Jones. Oliver Peyton, the fashionable Irish restaurateur, is further providing a restaurant, cafe and delicatessen, so catering promises to be of a high standard. Commuters beetling back to Waterloo in the evening can pick up civilised food to take home, and might even be tempted to listen to a concert or take in an exhibition instead of rushing headlong to all points suburban. </p> <p>It sounds almost exhausting to say that these are only the highlights of what for many first-time visitors to Somerset House will be something of a magical mystery tour of this noble Palladian architecture. There are so many other pleasures: just wait until you see the Nelson Stair (blitzed in 1940, reconstructed by Sir Albert Richardson, one of the last convincing British classicists), or the Courtauld's collection of Impressionist and Post- Impressionist paintings that now adorn this former government ghetto. </p> <p>Somerset House offers many lessons in how we might transform our city centres at the outset of the 21st century. Most importantly, it demonstrates how a major civic building not only needs to be well looked after and generally available (there is something odd in the fact that so many public buildings are closed to the public), but can connect beneficially to the streets and wider city beyond. Our towns and cities are notorious for being disjointed; think how many famous and grand buildings have been all but cut off by roads and traffic, or used as dumping grounds and, of course, car parks. From the spring, Somerset House will be not just an attraction in its own right, but a kind of urban junction box, routing pedestrians through its architectural glories to city quarters north and south of the Thames. </p> <p>More than this, the transformation of Somerset House is a good example of how urban thinking can be \"joined up\": people walking through its courtyard to other parts of central London will find themselves wanting to stop for a coffee or part of an open-air performance, or dropping in on exhibitions that they must otherwise make a special trip to see. </p> <p>To make great cultural venues a real part of city life is an intelligent step towards making high art truly accessible. Because people will be able to spin through the heart of Somerset House as well as to stop and browse, they will become familiar, over a long time, with the arts and events it promises to put on show from May. </p> <p>This redevelopment is, in short, a triumph. The fact that such a triumph should have come into being quietly, subtly and without the bombastic force of overweening PR hype or government spin is almost a miracle. Now it's time to see the Somerset House effect spreading to the rest of our town and city centres.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Despite tensions on the Korean peninsula, across the Taiwan straits and in the South China sea, East Asia was more peaceful during the 90s than at any time during the past 100 years. (The region comprises China, Taiwan, Japan, the two Koreas, Thailand, Malaysia and eight other south-east Asian states.) Yet during the past decade those east Asian governments have been spending substantially on weapons and military modernisation. Prosperity has grown but so, it appears, has insecurity.</p> <p>The 1997 recession forced some (Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and to a lesser extent South Korea and Japan) to cut spending. But like China, Taiwan and Singapore, all little affected by the economic downturn, other countries in the region - especially Japan and South Korea - went on boosting their military capabilities.</p> <p>Recent deals include a large consignment of Su-27 fighters for China from Russia at a cost of $2.5bn, Japan's purchase of four American Awacs aircraft with a price tag of $1bn, 13 British naval helicopters for South Korea ($337m), 60 French Mirage 2000 fighters for Taiwan ($2.6bn), a new Thai aircraft carrier from Spain ($257m), four Swedish subs for Singapore ($400m), and two British frigates for Malaysia ($600m).</p> <p>The governments claim they have just used their new wealth to modernise their forces, implying mere upgrading of existing equipment. Closer analysis shows them going far beyond simple updating. Generally, the money has gone on conventional weapons, but in China and North Korea programmes involve nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.</p> <p>East Asia became an important market for American and European defence suppliers (and Russia and Israel) after the end of the cold war. Americans are pre-eminent though competitors have won contracts on the back of Washington's restrictions on arms sales to Taiwan and China and American reluctance to share advanced defence technology.</p> <p>Europeans (Britain and France especially) have often supplied equipment the Americans cannot or will not. Western governments are likely to outlaw arms only for states which commit gross human rights violations. Russia has no such qualms. Russia has regained its role as an exporter mainly because of its willingness to arm China, largely under embargo by the west since 1989.</p> <p>To operate successfully in the region, suppliers have had to agree to transfer technology. But the region has not depended entirely on imports. Home-grown defence industries have benefited from the technology transfer and other offset arrangements which international suppliers must usually provide in order to secure contracts. Yet this dependence also reflects limited capabilities. Even the region's more advanced defence industries in Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore remain weak in critical areas.</p> <p>Despite the new equipment, it is not clear that Asian armies and navies are any more capable of fighting effectively. Some are halfway there. The most militarily advanced states, in terms of conventional capabilities, are Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. However, these are all \"status quo powers\": none looks likely to use its growing military means aggressively. Indeed, recent developments in these states' conventional capabilities may stabilise the local military balance, particularly if it helps to deter China from attacking Taiwan or North Korea from launching an offensive against the South Koreans.</p> <p>The key regional player remains the United States through its alliances with Japan and South Korea and its special relationship with Taiwan. It has a substantial lead in what experts call the \"revolution in military affairs\", which revolves around integrating hi-tech command, control, communications and intelligence systems with precision-guided weapons. American conventional forces will continue to outclass any likely east Asian adversaries for at least the next decade.</p> <p>Yet two things threaten to undermine the military advantages of the US and regional powers supporting the status quo. One is the Chinese and North Korean missile and nuclear programmes.

      "bodyText": "Despite tensions on the Korean peninsula, across the Taiwan straits and in the South China sea, East Asia was more peaceful during the 90s than at any time during the past 100 years. (The region comprises China, Taiwan, Japan, the two Koreas, Thailand, Malaysia and eight other south-east Asian states.) Yet during the past decade those east Asian governments have been spending substantially on weapons and military modernisation. Prosperity has grown but so, it appears, has insecurity. The 1997 recession forced some (Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and to a lesser extent South Korea and Japan) to cut spending. But like China, Taiwan and Singapore, all little affected by the economic downturn, other countries in the region - especially Japan and South Korea - went on boosting their military capabilities. Recent deals include a large consignment of Su-27 fighters for China from Russia at a cost of $2.5bn, Japan's purchase of four American Awacs aircraft with a price tag of $1bn, 13 British naval helicopters for South Korea ($337m), 60 French Mirage 2000 fighters for Taiwan ($2.6bn), a new Thai aircraft carrier from Spain ($257m), four Swedish subs for Singapore ($400m), and two British frigates for Malaysia ($600m). The governments claim they have just used their new wealth to modernise their forces, implying mere upgrading of existing equipment. Closer analysis shows them going far beyond simple updating. Generally, the money has gone on conventional weapons, but in China and North Korea programmes involve nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. East Asia became an important market for American and European defence suppliers (and Russia and Israel) after the end of the cold war. Americans are pre-eminent though competitors have won contracts on the back of Washington's restrictions on arms sales to Taiwan and China and American reluctance to share advanced defence technology. Europeans (Britain and France especially) have often supplied equipment the Americans cannot or will not. Western governments are likely to outlaw arms only for states which commit gross human rights violations. Russia has no such qualms. Russia has regained its role as an exporter mainly because of its willingness to arm China, largely under embargo by the west since 1989. To operate successfully in the region, suppliers have had to agree to transfer technology. But the region has not depended entirely on imports. Home-grown defence industries have benefited from the technology transfer and other offset arrangements which international suppliers must usually provide in order to secure contracts. Yet this dependence also reflects limited capabilities. Even the region's more advanced defence industries in Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore remain weak in critical areas. Despite the new equipment, it is not clear that Asian armies and navies are any more capable of fighting effectively. Some are halfway there. The most militarily advanced states, in terms of conventional capabilities, are Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. However, these are all \"status quo powers\": none looks likely to use its growing military means aggressively. Indeed, recent developments in these states' conventional capabilities may stabilise the local military balance, particularly if it helps to deter China from attacking Taiwan or North Korea from launching an offensive against the South Koreans. The key regional player remains the United States through its alliances with Japan and South Korea and its special relationship with Taiwan. It has a substantial lead in what experts call the \"revolution in military affairs\", which revolves around integrating hi-tech command, control, communications and intelligence systems with precision-guided weapons. American conventional forces will continue to outclass any likely east Asian adversaries for at least the next decade. Yet two things threaten to undermine the military advantages of the US and regional powers supporting the status quo. One is the Chinese and North Korean missile and nuclear programmes. Washington might, in the not-too-distant future, find the American homeland as well as its forces overseas held hostage by Chinese and Korean missiles. Anti-missile defences may not provide a timely, affordable, effective or politically acceptable solution to this problem. If recent tests are any guide, they may not work either. Beijing is arming the People's Liberation army with hi-tech systems and may eventually challenge not just neighbours but threaten American aircraft carriers with potentially highly accurate and destructive but relatively cheap weapons, such as state-of-the-art anti-ship missiles and high-speed torpedoes. These threats to regional stability suggest more intense cooperation between the central players is vital. Cooperation will have to be based on \"security with\" rather than \"security against\". Continued engagement between the US and China is critical: while Washington needs to deal firmly with Beijing where vital interests are concerned, gratuitous confrontation (for example, deploying missile defence systems or over-arming Taiwan) could prove counterproductive.

He is replacing Maria Joao Pires, one of the most sought-after pianists on the international circuit. </p> <p>Haefliger, 37, has less to prove than many of his peers. He is a serious, strong-minded musician with an established international career and has worked successfully with the Concertgebouw before. The repertoire suits him well, and he says that he had enough notice of the event to regard it as just another date in the diary. </p> <p>\"Chailly and the Concertgebouw were something I was hoping to fit into my schedule anyway,\" Haefliger says, \"though the opportunity has arisen a little sooner than I thought.\" For all that, he could still gain much glory if he proves himself a worthy replacement for Pires. </p> <p>Today's concert promoters are increasingly reluctant to take a chance on newcomers, however. The more dramatic and high-profile the cancellation, the harder their task becomes and the greater the danger of damaging the precious relationship with their audience. </p> <p>A couple of years ago, Cecilia Bartoli, probably the world's best-loved mezzo-soprano, suddenly pulled out of a London Philharmonic fundraising gala concert at Glyndebourne, and the LPO's chief executive, Serge Dorny, had just 48 hours to sort out a replacement and inform 1,000 audience members. The singers Thomas Allen and Susan Graham were drafted in; meanwhile, the LPO office telephoned every single ticket holder. \"People were disappointed, but they were grateful to have been personally contacted,\" says Dorny, \"and only one person asked to exchange the ticket.\" </p> <p>He emphasises that cancellations are usually made with good reason. \"Nobody cancels a concert with pleasure - it's inconvenient for everyone.\" </p> <p>That's something of an understatement. Last Friday the Alban Berg Quartet, one of the world's top string ensembles, had to cancel Saturday's sold-out concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall because one of the violinists had caught pneumonia. No quartet of the same calibre was available, and box-office staff were left with less than 36 hours to contact the holders of 1,000 tickets. </p> <p>But there is a small number of top-notch musicians who have earned themselves reputations as notorious cancellers. The pianists Sviatoslav Richter and Arturo Benedetti Michel-angeli, both of whom died in the 90s, achieved the status of legends primarily for their artistry but also partly because of the mystique surrounding their frequent non-appearances on stage. No one who bought a ticket for their concerts could be sure that they would actually hear them play. </p> <p>Pianist Martha Argerich has long-term health problems that have made her an irregular recitalist. When she did give a concert in London in March 1999, she had been absent from the stage for a year - and got rave reviews. But only the greatest musicians can cancel frequently and get away with it. \"It's quite courageous of Maria [Joao Pires] to cancel,\" says Haefliger. \"I think it's a wonderful thing that she can decide to give herself some time to replenish the batteries.\" According to Pires's agent, she is taking a year's break from performing. </p> <p> Younger musicians setting out to increase their mystique with a few cancellations are asking for trouble, however. \"In the case of Argerich, people will take the risk because she's such a brilliant pianist and everyone loves her,\" says Jilly Clarke, an artist manager with the musical agency Askonas Holt. \"But if a younger artist who isn't well known starts messing promoters around, it can take years for them to recover from the bad reputation that results. They get dropped like hot bricks.\" </p> <p>In 1997, a young Russian competition winner was booked for a UK tour. He refused to commit himself totally. The agents rang up British pianist Lucy Parham and asked her to be on standby for six months in case he pulled out, which he finally did, with one month's notice. Parham did the tour; the Russian hasn't been asked back. </p> <p>\"Up to a point you are totally dispensable,\" says Parham wryly. \"Unless you are an Argerich or a Richter, there are innumerable pianists who can replace you. There's less work around now than 10 years ago, so people are very loath to give up a date and pass it on to a colleague, who may then do better with the orchestra and be invited back instead of you. \"I have played with horrible flu,\" Parham continues. \"Another time I'd hurt my foot and could hardly move. I went on to the platform wearing a long evening dress, one shoe and one trainer.\" </p> <p>As for agreeing to step into another musician's shoes, the young British pianist Leon McCawley says, \"It's all about decision making and risk taking.\" A popular figure with British audiences after coming second in the 1993 Leeds piano competition, aged only 19, McCawley has been offered opportunities that could well have put him on the fast track to stardom. \"I've had some nice experiences taking over cancellations. But once I was asked to step in for Richard Goode at the Proms at one week's notice with a Mozart concerto I'd never done and I decided it was too much of a risk.\" </p> <p>About five years ago, a television broadcast of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto in Coventry cathedral came McCawley's way at the last moment. He turned it down. A lost opportunity? Perhaps. </p> <p>Clarke says she and fellow agents have to be very careful about offering young artists replacement dates. \"We have a huge responsibility to put them up for things if we think they're up to it; but, if they're not ready, or a particular audience is too demanding, we shouldn't suggest them. Doing the wrong thing at the wrong time can destroy someone.\" </p> <p>For most young musicians, last-minute dates present an impossible dilemma. Play well and you can kick-start your career; accept something too risky and you may well end up playing Russian roulette with your future. </p> <p>Andreas Haefliger plays the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (0171-960 4242), on Saturday, with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and conductor Riccardo Chailly.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Freeserve has begun takeover talks with the troubled children's book publisher Dorling Kindersley which would significantly boost the content offering of the UK's largest internet access provider. Sources from both companies confirmed discussions had been held for \"some time\" and were accelerated after Dorling Kindersley's profits warning last week when it said it would report a \u00a325m pre-tax loss for the December half-year and announced the resignation of its chief executive, James Middlehurst. Insiders close to Freeserve said: \"They have been having discussions and it does make a sensible addition to online content.\" DK shares were on a roller coaster last week, falling sharply on the profits warning and then adding almost \u00a31 to to Friday's close of 372.5p, valuing the company at \u00a3267m. The price of a bid has been put as high as \u00a3360m. Any offer would be likely to be in shares, given Freeserve's strong performance since it floated last July at 150p. The shares closed at 622.25p on Friday. Talks are going ahead despite job cuts at online fashion retailer Boo.com and bookseller Amazon which have caused concern about the future of online businesses. DK's losses were caused by a \"seriously misjudged over-investment\" in Star Wars books and the promotion associated with it. An alternative to takeover might be Freeserve acquiring exclusive rights to the British content of DK. Freeserve's content includes travel, insurance, books, electrical goods and an auction site.",

Some companies do give better pension provision to senior management, but it is increasingly common to have one set of rules for the whole company. </p> <p>Almost two-thirds of companies offer pensions to their support staff and the strongest factor in determining whether they do so is their size. The administrative, secretarial and support staff survey produced by recruitment consultants Gordon Yates and the Guardian found that 87% of all large companies (those with more than 1,000 employees) offer support staff some form of pension provision, but only a third of small firms (less than 10 employees) do. This disparity may increase following the government's announcement this month that businesses with fewer than five staff will be exempt from having to provide staff with the new stakeholder pensions when they come into effect next year. </p> <p>Stakeholder pensions are aimed at workers with low earnings - those on a salary of between \u00a39,000 and \u00a318,000 a year - who do not have a private pension. Ministers hope the new scheme will encourage those without pension provision to start making plans for their future. </p> <p>But even if your package does include a pension, secretarial staff may still be losing out, according to Richard Grace, Gordon Yates' managing director. \"A lot of company pensions are linked to salary packages, so if the company contributes 5% of your salary as a PA, it is much less than a high earner is getting,\" he says. It's a case of the higher the salary, the larger the benefit, so low- paid employees suffer.\" </p> <p>The survey found secretarial staff attached a high value to jobs that had pension provision, the favourite being non-contributory schemes, where employers make the payments.

Sampson set up hers through a financial adviser recommended by her employer. She puts in 5% of her salary and her employers contribute the equivalent of 10%. </p> <p>She admits it is a good deal, but it wasn't her priority: \"I'd decided I wanted a career in development so when this job came up I grabbed it - the pension wasn't a big incentive. Salaries here are not huge, so I don't think people are really on the lookout for competitive benefits packages.\" She admits it would be different if she were to work for a big City firm. \"Because it would be that type of environment, I'd ask a lot more questions about what sort of pension I'd get and look at those details carefully.\" </p> <p>A good company pension is important to Sarah Macintosh, a secretary at accountants KPMG. She explains: \"There is not as much career development potential in secretarial work and the pay is never going to be great, so the benefits that a company provides, such as a pension, really make a difference to the deal I'm getting.\" </p> <p>Macintosh has changed jobs regularly in the past but is reluctant to do so now because she knows she will lose out. \"It's not just because of losing out financially if I move, although that would probably happen.

      "body": "<p>The Roman philosopher Seneca didn't know a great deal about office politics or corporate networking, but he had a neat line in motivational epigrams.\"When a man does not know what harbour he is making for, no wind is the right wind,\" he wrote in his Epistolae ad Lucilium. </p> <p>It's a sentiment endorsed (and reprinted) in Anthony Weldon's book Breakthrough: Your Guide to Handling Career Opportunities and Changes. The book will, suggests the epigram, help to guide you to your own personal harbour, filling your sails with positive winds of change as you embark on the great career journey. </p> <p>Stephanie Myers, author of I Want More: Straight-talking Advice on How to Get What You Want, prefers to quote Voltaire. In a chapter entitled \"I want more respect\" she cites his maxim: \"We owe respect to the living. To the dead we owe only truth.\" </p> <p>It's deliciously easy to mock workplace self-help books. All that touchy-feely stuff about Knowing Your Inner Work Self! and Finding Power In The Office! - exclamation marks and excessive capitalisation in the title, gung-ho motivational exhortations in the text. It all feels a bit embarrassing and, well, American, in a nation where we are more comfortable apologising when someone walks into us on the Tube. </p> <p>But cheesy or not, it seems we can't get enough of personal development books. The market in the UK for motivational manuals has seen phenomenal growth in the past decade, and all indications are that the curve will continue steeply upwards. High street bookshops set increasingly substantial chunks of their floorspace aside for pop psychology guides, and tempt us at the checkout with bitesize versions of the same. Men and women may be from different planets, but it seems the road less travelled has been well trod by all of us. And I'm OK if you are. </p> <p>While many of the well-known bestsellers deal with general personal and spiritual development, our increasing enthusiasm for emotional self-motivation and Oprah-style sharing has also spilled into the workplace. Help is available for every type of office dilemma, offering to increase your confidence, improve your powers of influence, and get you the job of your dreams. After all, You Deserve It! </p> <p>But if the emotional gushiness of the career self-help market is easily parodied, the reasons behind the genre's extraordinary popularity are less lighthearted. The workplace is less secure, and if we want to get on, we suspect we'll have to make it happen ourselves. Managers are under pressure to squeeze ever more from their staff, and so are more receptive to \"alternative\" management strategies. The flexible market demands flexible skills. If in doubt, buy a book. </p> <p>\"I suppose if you look at it from a cynical point of view, you could say that we are fitting into people's insecurities,\" says Pauline Goodwin, publishing director at specialist business publisher Kogan Page. \"Every organisation has a hierarchy, and trying to understand that, and the systems and processes of the organisation, is important. I think people want to know how to behave and present themselves. Who are the people you should be looking to impress?\" </p> <p>She thinks wider changes in society have also contributed to the boom in career motivation books. \"There are increasing numbers of women returners and women in the workplace generally. The former group in particular need their confidence boosted, having been out of the workplace for some time, and the latter group, particularly the new generation of women entering the job market, are determined to compete on an even footing with men, and keen to progress their careers.\" </p> <p>A third important factor, crucially, is the growing emphasis on so-called \"soft skills\". Flexibility, initiative and \"common sense\" are repeatedly mentioned by employers and recruiters as skills in short supply, not abilities one can easily set out to acquire on a course or through application alone. The easy self-knowledge, confidence and powers of influence promised by many books in the genre are tempting prizes indeed. </p> <p>But publishers admit that the self-help genre has something of an image problem in the UK, despite its phenomenal growth. \"British people want more pragmatic advice, rather than the vacuous razzmatazz you often get in American books in this field,\" says Goodwin. \"We don't want to learn how to 'Transform Ourselves In The Workplace!' if it's not giving practical advice.\" </p> <p>Similarly, Judith Dennett, head of publishing at the Institute of Personnel and Development, is eager to stress that the career help books published by the IPD are the \"respectable face\" of self-help publishing. \"I don't think there's anything wrong with talking about human things at work,\" she says, \"but it's the sentimentalising of that which is wrong. Much of it would stick in your throat. We don't want to be seen as a comedy act.\" </p> <p>In fact many of the British books published in the field seem to take pains to distance themselves from the most emotive excesses of the genre. \"Forget the 'power of positive thinking' and 'fake it to make it': these are very good strategies, but put them in storage for now,\" writes chartered psychologist Jim Mackay in Breakthrough. Ros Taylor, author of Transform Yourself! says her book discusses \"a number of different ways of thinking, not just an adjuration to think more positively, as I have always thought that so insulting.\" </p> <p>Despite making her own contribution to the genre, Lucy Kellaway retains a healthy scepticism about the popularity of career advice books. \"What happens to all those management books that are published in greater number each year?,\" she asks in Sense and Nonsense in the Office. \"Who has the time (or the inclination) to sit down and read them? The answer seems to be practically nobody. Managers buy the books, only to leave them on their shelves for show-off value or, at best, to dip into them briefly.\" </p> <p>In contrast to the relentless optimism of personal development-speak, Kellaway articulates the one great secret about our jobs that we all hate to admit - \"all work is tedious for much of the time. If everyone accepts this, then so much the better.\" </p> <p>It's a sentiment with which Seneca would probably agree. A member of the Stoic school, he held that happiness was achievable only by putting aside passion and submitting to one's duty. </p> <p><strong>Word power</strong></p> <p>Want a change of career, a new job, a new you?

      "bodyText": "The Roman philosopher Seneca didn't know a great deal about office politics or corporate networking, but he had a neat line in motivational epigrams.\"When a man does not know what harbour he is making for, no wind is the right wind,\" he wrote in his Epistolae ad Lucilium. It's a sentiment endorsed (and reprinted) in Anthony Weldon's book Breakthrough: Your Guide to Handling Career Opportunities and Changes. The book will, suggests the epigram, help to guide you to your own personal harbour, filling your sails with positive winds of change as you embark on the great career journey. Stephanie Myers, author of I Want More: Straight-talking Advice on How to Get What You Want, prefers to quote Voltaire. In a chapter entitled \"I want more respect\" she cites his maxim: \"We owe respect to the living. To the dead we owe only truth.\" It's deliciously easy to mock workplace self-help books. All that touchy-feely stuff about Knowing Your Inner Work Self! and Finding Power In The Office! - exclamation marks and excessive capitalisation in the title, gung-ho motivational exhortations in the text. It all feels a bit embarrassing and, well, American, in a nation where we are more comfortable apologising when someone walks into us on the Tube. But cheesy or not, it seems we can't get enough of personal development books. The market in the UK for motivational manuals has seen phenomenal growth in the past decade, and all indications are that the curve will continue steeply upwards. High street bookshops set increasingly substantial chunks of their floorspace aside for pop psychology guides, and tempt us at the checkout with bitesize versions of the same. Men and women may be from different planets, but it seems the road less travelled has been well trod by all of us. And I'm OK if you are. While many of the well-known bestsellers deal with general personal and spiritual development, our increasing enthusiasm for emotional self-motivation and Oprah-style sharing has also spilled into the workplace. Help is available for every type of office dilemma, offering to increase your confidence, improve your powers of influence, and get you the job of your dreams. After all, You Deserve It! But if the emotional gushiness of the career self-help market is easily parodied, the reasons behind the genre's extraordinary popularity are less lighthearted. The workplace is less secure, and if we want to get on, we suspect we'll have to make it happen ourselves. Managers are under pressure to squeeze ever more from their staff, and so are more receptive to \"alternative\" management strategies. The flexible market demands flexible skills. If in doubt, buy a book. \"I suppose if you look at it from a cynical point of view, you could say that we are fitting into people's insecurities,\" says Pauline Goodwin, publishing director at specialist business publisher Kogan Page. \"Every organisation has a hierarchy, and trying to understand that, and the systems and processes of the organisation, is important. I think people want to know how to behave and present themselves. Who are the people you should be looking to impress?\" She thinks wider changes in society have also contributed to the boom in career motivation books. \"There are increasing numbers of women returners and women in the workplace generally. The former group in particular need their confidence boosted, having been out of the workplace for some time, and the latter group, particularly the new generation of women entering the job market, are determined to compete on an even footing with men, and keen to progress their careers.\" A third important factor, crucially, is the growing emphasis on so-called \"soft skills\". Flexibility, initiative and \"common sense\" are repeatedly mentioned by employers and recruiters as skills in short supply, not abilities one can easily set out to acquire on a course or through application alone. The easy self-knowledge, confidence and powers of influence promised by many books in the genre are tempting prizes indeed. But publishers admit that the self-help genre has something of an image problem in the UK, despite its phenomenal growth. \"British people want more pragmatic advice, rather than the vacuous razzmatazz you often get in American books in this field,\" says Goodwin. \"We don't want to learn how to 'Transform Ourselves In The Workplace!' if it's not giving practical advice.\" Similarly, Judith Dennett, head of publishing at the Institute of Personnel and Development, is eager to stress that the career help books published by the IPD are the \"respectable face\" of self-help publishing. \"I don't think there's anything wrong with talking about human things at work,\" she says, \"but it's the sentimentalising of that which is wrong. Much of it would stick in your throat. We don't want to be seen as a comedy act.\" In fact many of the British books published in the field seem to take pains to distance themselves from the most emotive excesses of the genre. \"Forget the 'power of positive thinking' and 'fake it to make it': these are very good strategies, but put them in storage for now,\" writes chartered psychologist Jim Mackay in Breakthrough. Ros Taylor, author of Transform Yourself! says her book discusses \"a number of different ways of thinking, not just an adjuration to think more positively, as I have always thought that so insulting.\" Despite making her own contribution to the genre, Lucy Kellaway retains a healthy scepticism about the popularity of career advice books. \"What happens to all those management books that are published in greater number each year?,\" she asks in Sense and Nonsense in the Office. \"Who has the time (or the inclination) to sit down and read them? The answer seems to be practically nobody. Managers buy the books, only to leave them on their shelves for show-off value or, at best, to dip into them briefly.\" In contrast to the relentless optimism of personal development-speak, Kellaway articulates the one great secret about our jobs that we all hate to admit - \"all work is tedious for much of the time. If everyone accepts this, then so much the better.\" It's a sentiment with which Seneca would probably agree. A member of the Stoic school, he held that happiness was achievable only by putting aside passion and submitting to one's duty. Word power Want a change of career, a new job, a new you? These books all promise the chance to open a revised chapter in your life Breakthrough: Your Guide to Handling Career Opportunities and Changes. Edited by Anthony Weldon. (Bene Factum, \u00a310.99) Blurb: \"Job change - whether by force or by choice - is disturbing. It poses many questions. Questions that Breakthrough will help you answer. Only you can get the job you want, but Breakthrough will help you every step of the way.\" Sample: \"Perhaps you should get your act together, hold back any emotion you might feel and launch yourself on to the job market. After all, that really good job that you feel is right for you could be difficult to come by. So if you're busy at home reading and analysing, perhaps somebody else might be getting the very job that was made for you.\" By Ros Taylor. (Kogan Page, \u00a38.99) Blurb: \"This proven programme will help you to develop clarity of vision and renewed confidence in your own judgement and abilities. Transform Yourself! will inspire you to become more positive, productive and relaxed.\" Sample: \"We need from birth to be hugged and stroked, not only to provide us with a sense of security, but also to give us an awareness of the boundaries of our bodies. As we grow older, hugs and strokes are confined to intimate relationships, but we still desire metaphorical stroking, socially and at work. If these 'strokes' are absent then behavioural withdrawal or attention-seeking results.\" By John Courtis. (Institute of Personnel and Development, \u00a35.95) Blurb: \"Armed with Getting a Better Job by one of the UK's top recruitment experts, you can be confident that a persuasive application and polished interview will secure success.\" Sample: \"How to spot the warning signs [in potential employers].

      "bodyText": "Telecoms group Vodafone AirTouch dealt a knockout blow yesterday in its bid to take over Mannesman with the announcement of a deal with the German company's hoped-for saviour, Vivendi. Vodafone and Vivendi will pool their fixed-line networks and establish a European web portal, scuttling Mannesmann's hopes of an alliance with the French media group. Mannesmann was said to have been in discussions with Vivendi about a possible merger to save the German firm from falling to Vodafone's record \u00a395bn bid. That bid closes on February 7. The joint venture between Vodafone and Vivendi will see a powerful combination of their telecom and internet assets, potentially creating a pan-European fixed-line operation and web portal with up to 70m subscribers. The agreement is conditional on Vodafone winning 50% of Mannesmann. Under the terms of the pact, Vodafone would have management control of the joint venture company, which would run the web portal. A flotation of a minority stake in the web portal could be considered with 18 months, and a minority stake in the combined fixed-line networks might be floated. Vodafone has also agreed to sell 7.5% of France's second-largest telecoms group, C\u00e9g\u00e9tel, to Vivendi for an undisclosed sum. Mannesmann owns a 15% stake in C\u00e9g\u00e9tel, while Vivendi owns about 44%. Mannesmann hit back last night at Vodafone's plans claiming it was trying to sell off the \"family silver\". \"Vodafone's sell-off of Mannnesmann's premium assets continues,\" Klaus Esser, Mannesmann chairman, said. \"This would destroy Mannesmann's superior growth prospects and destroy the opportunity for significantly greater value for our shareholders.\" If Vodafone wins it will sell or float mobile phone group Orange, bought by Mannesmann last year. Chris Gent, Vodafone chief executive, said there was no intention to sell Orange to Vivendi. He said he had not spoken to Mr Esser about the alliance with Vivendi. \"The ball is now very much in his court.\" Mr Gent said talks with Vivendi had begun in earnest in the past three months and denied it was to prevent a deal between the French group and Mannesmann. Vivendi chairman Jean-Marie Messier said of the deal: \"It is an ideal alliance between two partners with highly complementary profiles and it comes at just the right moment.\"",
