Nothing's new. </p> <p>This is what the 1950s magazine Football Parade wrote of the former England captain Billy Wright, who was married to Joy from the Beverley Sisters. </p> <p>\"He is a teetotaller, does not smoke, goes to bed early and lives modestly. Because he is such an ideal for youngsters to follow, Billy has many invitations to attend youth clubs, team dinners, the presentation of prizes and similar functions. </p> <p>\"He's such a good-natured chap that he cheerfully obliged until Wolves found that he was taking too much out of himself and asked him to call a halt.\" </p> <p>\u0095 And you thought Peter Beardsley could only talk with his feet. Asked on Radio 4's Today programme whether England could beat Argentina, the former Newcastle player silenced his detractors by replying with a perfect example of poetic antithesis. </p> <p>\"If everyone plays as he can, </p> <p>\"There's no reason why we can't.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Watford's Graham Taylor does not like losing, despite his habit of smiling each time the Premiership's bottom side suffer another defeat. In fact Taylor's true feelings on the subject of losing can be verified by the following snapshot from his private life. </p> <p>\"If I have five races with my five-year-old grand-daughter across my back lawn, I never let her win 5-0,\" the former England manager callously admits. \"It's always 4-1. </p> <p>\"My excuse, when she gets upset, is that life is about winning and losing. But really that one win is for me. </p> <p>\"I get some stick from my wife for not letting our granddaughter win all five but I just can't do it.\" </p> <p>By the way, Watford fans praying for divine intervention to arrest their season's decline might like to know that the Chicago Theological Seminary has a Graham Taylor Chapel (our Chicago correspondent reliably informs us). </p> <p>\u0095 Of all the tributes paid to Sir Stanley Matthews this week, one in particular caught the eye, bearing in mind the current rumpus over ill-discipline. It came from Alan Mullery. \"On or off the pitch, Stanley Matthews had class. People used to kick him to bits when they played against him and he just used to look at them.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Animal Corner, part one: Atletico Madrid got themselves into a bit of a flap last Sunday when just before kick-off in the game against Espanyol flocks of pigeons landed on the pitch and pecked the goalmouths clean of most of the grass. </p> <p>Faced with large patches of dirt, red-faced club officials admitted that the problem was nothing new. However, all efforts to discourage the birds had failed. The club's list of cunning plans included leaving pigeon carcasses on the pitch and introducing stadium cats. </p> <p>\"We are looking for another solution,\" said an Atletico official, obviously trying to claw back the initiative. </p> <p>\u0095 Animal corner, part two: fans threw dead fish on to the pitch during Hungary's home game with Australia on Wednesday in protest at a cyanide spill by a part-Australian-owned company which killed wildlife in two Danube tributaries. We mention this because Hungary had a stinker too, losing 3-0. </p> <p>\u0095 A reader suggests that if Gazza is going to play in Australia, he should join the Sydney Marconi Stallions - as he could do with a stable background.</p>",

Because he is such an ideal for youngsters to follow, Billy has many invitations to attend youth clubs, team dinners, the presentation of prizes and similar functions. \"He's such a good-natured chap that he cheerfully obliged until Wolves found that he was taking too much out of himself and asked him to call a halt.\" \u0095 And you thought Peter Beardsley could only talk with his feet. Asked on Radio 4's Today programme whether England could beat Argentina, the former Newcastle player silenced his detractors by replying with a perfect example of poetic antithesis. \"If everyone plays as he can, \"There's no reason why we can't.\" \u0095 Watford's Graham Taylor does not like losing, despite his habit of smiling each time the Premiership's bottom side suffer another defeat. In fact Taylor's true feelings on the subject of losing can be verified by the following snapshot from his private life. \"If I have five races with my five-year-old grand-daughter across my back lawn, I never let her win 5-0,\" the former England manager callously admits. \"It's always 4-1. \"My excuse, when she gets upset, is that life is about winning and losing. But really that one win is for me. \"I get some stick from my wife for not letting our granddaughter win all five but I just can't do it.\" By the way, Watford fans praying for divine intervention to arrest their season's decline might like to know that the Chicago Theological Seminary has a Graham Taylor Chapel (our Chicago correspondent reliably informs us). \u0095 Of all the tributes paid to Sir Stanley Matthews this week, one in particular caught the eye, bearing in mind the current rumpus over ill-discipline. It came from Alan Mullery. \"On or off the pitch, Stanley Matthews had class. People used to kick him to bits when they played against him and he just used to look at them.\" \u0095 Animal Corner, part one: Atletico Madrid got themselves into a bit of a flap last Sunday when just before kick-off in the game against Espanyol flocks of pigeons landed on the pitch and pecked the goalmouths clean of most of the grass. Faced with large patches of dirt, red-faced club officials admitted that the problem was nothing new. However, all efforts to discourage the birds had failed. The club's list of cunning plans included leaving pigeon carcasses on the pitch and introducing stadium cats. \"We are looking for another solution,\" said an Atletico official, obviously trying to claw back the initiative. \u0095 Animal corner, part two: fans threw dead fish on to the pitch during Hungary's home game with Australia on Wednesday in protest at a cyanide spill by a part-Australian-owned company which killed wildlife in two Danube tributaries. We mention this because Hungary had a stinker too, losing 3-0. \u0095 A reader suggests that if Gazza is going to play in Australia, he should join the Sydney Marconi Stallions - as he could do with a stable background.",

      "trailText": "<p>The Governor does the unthinkable and calls time at Wimbledon by selling his 20% share in the club to the Norwegian businessman Bjorn Rune Gjelsten.</p>",
      "byline": "Jon Brodkin",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was a fitting way for a remarkable era to end. Once Sam Hammam had announced yesterday morning that he was selling his 20% share in Wimbledon to the Norwegian businessman Bjorn Rune Gjelsten, he was given a send-off neither he nor his dry-cleaner will forget in a hurry. </p> <p>Whipped off his feet by a clutch of players at the club's training ground, Hammam was dumped in a puddle of Lake Superior proportions. Before wriggling out he had water kicked over his suit and in his face. The last remaining member of the original Crazy Gang could hardly have scripted it better. </p> <p>Not that it was all fun and games. Hammam looked close to tears as he explained why he was relinquishing control after more than 22 years. His relationship with the Norwegian businessmen who took a ma jority stake in 1997 had become increasingly fraught. Finally, he acknowledged it was unworkable. </p> <p>\"The lack of harmony was like a cancer eating into the club,\" he said. \"Naturally I am not happy this is happening. I believe like John Wayne said in one of his movies 'A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do' and I'm doing that. I am not bitter, just stunned.\" </p> <p>Hammam will stay on as a director and will advise Gjelsten, the new chairman, during the period of transition. But his power, his real involvement with the club he hauled from non-League football to the top flight is gone. </p> <p>The \"Governor\" had high hopes when he sold 80% of Wimbledon to Gjelsten and Kjell-Inge Rokke for an estimated \u00a330m. There was talk of big investment, of taking the Premiership side to unprecedented heights. </p> <p>\"Unfortunately,\" Hammam said, \"things did not work out like the brochure promised. Kjell became entangled in many things and was unable to give any love or attention to Wimbledon. In two years and eight months he was able to attend only one home game. </p> <p>\"Bjorn was far too busy running the empire and could only give us attention in dribs and drabs, mainly over the phone. We had to do something. A lot of options were discussed but we could not find a way through.\" </p> <p>Hammam, frustrated by a chronic lack of communication and unable to run affairs as he wished, concluded his departure was the best solution. For him Wimbledon was a love affair; for Rokke it seemed to be a business. The most public fall-out came in December when Hammam refused to sell players to meet a short-term deficit of around \u00a33m and Rokke installed a chief executive, to overhaul the running of the club. </p> <p>Hammam hinted at a deep mistrust when he said Gjelsten, who took a stake as part of the original deal but sold it to Rokke, was \"the only one who can convince Kjell to do things that he might not be comfortable doing otherwise\". They are friends and business partners. Gjelsten, unlike Rokke, is a football man. </p> <p>And so Hammam has sold out for an estimated \u00a31m. \"Peanuts,\" was how he described it, though he has not done badly from an initial investment of around \u00a340,000. </p> <p>The suddenness of Hammam's departure is appropriate given the way he arrived. In 1977 he sent his wife from civil war-ravaged Lebanon to London to give birth and he was asked on a visit to Wimbledon (he was a fan of the tennis) to help the local football club. Despite not knowing a goalline from a clothes line, he agreed. That was Wimbledon's first year in the Football League. By 1986 they were in the top flight. </p> <p>The rise he oversaw on meagre resources will surely never be repeated. Even without a ground, Wimbledon have continued to prosper and Hammam has been central to it all, helping to foster the togetherness, showing his love on the touchline. \"Wimbledon is my heroin,\" he once said. </p> <p>At times the man from the Lebanese mountain village of Dhourshweir seems to be on something. He would get drunk with the players, sit in on team talks, put a clause in Bobby Gould's contract allowing him to change the team up to 45 minutes before kick-off, and even scribbled grafitti on the dressing-room wall at West Ham to gee up his players. They won. </p> <p>\"He is unique,\" said the captain Robbie Earle. \"When I came to meet him and discuss a move from Port Vale he picked me up at Euston and went to his house. He brought me into the study, locked the door and put the key down his pants. Then he said to me I could have the key and leave but if I did we would never speak again. So I decided to sign and that sums up Sam perfectly.\" </p> <p>No one could doubt Hammam's commitment to Wimbledon. \"I'd rather die and have vultures eat my inside than merge with Crystal Palace,\" he insisted in 1992. </p> <p>\"It's a sad day and a big shock for us all,\" Earle said. \"Everybody had a personal relationship with him. There is apprehension among the players. We all know we are at a crossroads. The new owners have made the right noises but it is their actions that will show us what they want to do.\" </p> <p>Gjelsten insisted Wimbledon had nothing to worry about at a club where another Norwegian, Egil Olsen, was installed as manager last June. No, players would not be sold. Yes, a new stadium was a priority. Yes, the club would be treated as a passion not a business. \"Sam knows we will invest and do the right things,\" he said. \"I really hope I can convince Sam to come with us.\" </p> <p>What Rokke and Gjelsten have achieved at Molde bodes well. The Norwegian club play at a new ground and reached this season's Champions League. But Hammam, \"the mother and father of Wimbledon\", will be missed. </p> <p>\u0095Sir Alex Ferguson has assured David Beckham he will be recalled to the Manchester United side to face Wimbledon at Selhurst Park today if he overcomes an ankle injury sustained in England's game against Argentina.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was a fitting way for a remarkable era to end. Once Sam Hammam had announced yesterday morning that he was selling his 20% share in Wimbledon to the Norwegian businessman Bjorn Rune Gjelsten, he was given a send-off neither he nor his dry-cleaner will forget in a hurry. Whipped off his feet by a clutch of players at the club's training ground, Hammam was dumped in a puddle of Lake Superior proportions. Before wriggling out he had water kicked over his suit and in his face. The last remaining member of the original Crazy Gang could hardly have scripted it better. Not that it was all fun and games. Hammam looked close to tears as he explained why he was relinquishing control after more than 22 years. His relationship with the Norwegian businessmen who took a ma jority stake in 1997 had become increasingly fraught. Finally, he acknowledged it was unworkable. \"The lack of harmony was like a cancer eating into the club,\" he said. \"Naturally I am not happy this is happening. I believe like John Wayne said in one of his movies 'A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do' and I'm doing that. I am not bitter, just stunned.\" Hammam will stay on as a director and will advise Gjelsten, the new chairman, during the period of transition. But his power, his real involvement with the club he hauled from non-League football to the top flight is gone. The \"Governor\" had high hopes when he sold 80% of Wimbledon to Gjelsten and Kjell-Inge Rokke for an estimated \u00a330m. There was talk of big investment, of taking the Premiership side to unprecedented heights. \"Unfortunately,\" Hammam said, \"things did not work out like the brochure promised. Kjell became entangled in many things and was unable to give any love or attention to Wimbledon. In two years and eight months he was able to attend only one home game. \"Bjorn was far too busy running the empire and could only give us attention in dribs and drabs, mainly over the phone. We had to do something. A lot of options were discussed but we could not find a way through.\" Hammam, frustrated by a chronic lack of communication and unable to run affairs as he wished, concluded his departure was the best solution. For him Wimbledon was a love affair; for Rokke it seemed to be a business. The most public fall-out came in December when Hammam refused to sell players to meet a short-term deficit of around \u00a33m and Rokke installed a chief executive, to overhaul the running of the club. Hammam hinted at a deep mistrust when he said Gjelsten, who took a stake as part of the original deal but sold it to Rokke, was \"the only one who can convince Kjell to do things that he might not be comfortable doing otherwise\". They are friends and business partners. Gjelsten, unlike Rokke, is a football man. And so Hammam has sold out for an estimated \u00a31m. \"Peanuts,\" was how he described it, though he has not done badly from an initial investment of around \u00a340,000. The suddenness of Hammam's departure is appropriate given the way he arrived. In 1977 he sent his wife from civil war-ravaged Lebanon to London to give birth and he was asked on a visit to Wimbledon (he was a fan of the tennis) to help the local football club. Despite not knowing a goalline from a clothes line, he agreed. That was Wimbledon's first year in the Football League. By 1986 they were in the top flight. The rise he oversaw on meagre resources will surely never be repeated. Even without a ground, Wimbledon have continued to prosper and Hammam has been central to it all, helping to foster the togetherness, showing his love on the touchline. \"Wimbledon is my heroin,\" he once said. At times the man from the Lebanese mountain village of Dhourshweir seems to be on something. He would get drunk with the players, sit in on team talks, put a clause in Bobby Gould's contract allowing him to change the team up to 45 minutes before kick-off, and even scribbled grafitti on the dressing-room wall at West Ham to gee up his players. They won. \"He is unique,\" said the captain Robbie Earle. \"When I came to meet him and discuss a move from Port Vale he picked me up at Euston and went to his house. He brought me into the study, locked the door and put the key down his pants. Then he said to me I could have the key and leave but if I did we would never speak again. So I decided to sign and that sums up Sam perfectly.\" No one could doubt Hammam's commitment to Wimbledon. \"I'd rather die and have vultures eat my inside than merge with Crystal Palace,\" he insisted in 1992. \"It's a sad day and a big shock for us all,\" Earle said. \"Everybody had a personal relationship with him. There is apprehension among the players. We all know we are at a crossroads. The new owners have made the right noises but it is their actions that will show us what they want to do.\" Gjelsten insisted Wimbledon had nothing to worry about at a club where another Norwegian, Egil Olsen, was installed as manager last June. No, players would not be sold. Yes, a new stadium was a priority. Yes, the club would be treated as a passion not a business. \"Sam knows we will invest and do the right things,\" he said. \"I really hope I can convince Sam to come with us.\" What Rokke and Gjelsten have achieved at Molde bodes well. The Norwegian club play at a new ground and reached this season's Champions League. But Hammam, \"the mother and father of Wimbledon\", will be missed. \u0095Sir Alex Ferguson has assured David Beckham he will be recalled to the Manchester United side to face Wimbledon at Selhurst Park today if he overcomes an ankle injury sustained in England's game against Argentina.",

But, having won his first match, he took the series against England 3-1. </p> <p>Since then, however, West Indies cricket has had some awful times. The following winter the tour to South Africa was preceded by acrimonious arguments between players and board over pay and conditions, with Lara first sacked then reinstated and the team subsequently losing all of the five Tests and six of the seven one-day internationals. </p> <p>Then, after an uplifting drawn series at home to Australia, which saw Lara play two of the greatest innings the game has seen to win matches against the odds in Jamaica and Barbados, came the nadir at the end of last year when they lost both Tests to New Zealand as well as all five one- day internationals. After one such defeat Lara was observed close to tears as he talked about \"trying to salvage a legacy\". </p> <p>No one could point a finger at Lara's personal performance as captain - in his 18 matches in charge he has averaged 50.13 against a career average of 51.6 and against Australia produced innings of 213, 153 not out and 100 in successive matches.

      "body": "<p>When you climb the track past the disused quarry at Tiscombe and reach the ridge of the Quantocks, you suddenly find yourself on an ancient drove road between an avenue of twisted beech trees. Parts of the track are cut into the soil among shoulder-high roots. </p> <p>\"It's a sensational place,\" says Ewen Cameron. \"Sometimes there's mist swirling below in the valley, and you're up there above it, looking down on a white cloud. It's not hard to imagine the herds of animals being driven along the top to market in Taunton. </p> <p>\"I come from the north of Scotland and, when I first saw these hills in the mid-1970s, I was quite surprised. I thought, wow, Somerset's got it, too. And I knew that Wordsworth and Coleridge lived nearby and would have walked these hills, and that adds to the sense of history.\" </p> <p>From this southern starting point, Cameron's favourite walk takes him six miles along the ridge before he turns off and into Bicknoller, a place dear to his heart as chairman of the Countryside Agency: it's got a community-owned post office and shop, the kind of sustainable rural enterprise he's trying to encourage. </p> <p>\"You pass out of the beech trees through various gates into a rougher moorland area, with gorse and broom. Suddenly it seems much wilder and, on a clear day, the views are fantastic, right over the islands of the Bristol Channel and up into Wales. There's also Hinkley Point power station sitting there, very imposing, but not attractive. </p> <p>\"Behind, you look south to the Blackdown Hills and the Wellington Monument 15 or 20 miles away. It's when you get towards the northern end that you're likely to see the red deer that live here, near a place called Bicknoller Post and the woodland that runs down on the western side of the hills.\" </p> <p>Cameron owns the Dillington Estate, near Ilminster, 10 miles to the south of the Quantocks, and is a former president of the Country Landowners Association. He's married with four children and two labrador dogs, and some of them come with him on walks. \"I think what I get out of it is relaxation and spiritual uplift and just plain exercise - filling the lungs with air. If it contributes to problem-solving, it's by taking the mind off the problem for a few hours so you come back to it fresh.\" </p> <p>The Quantocks - from the earlier cantuc, believed to come from the Welsh word canto, meaning circle or rim - are one of the few places in Britain where the landscape looks much the same as it did 6,000 years ago. Neolithic settlers cleared the 1,000ft tops for grazing and they've stayed like that ever since, apart from a brief attempt to plough them in medieval times. Ten years ago, Somerset County Council fought off a proposal to put signs on the M5, and it's still official policy to avoid national publicity for the Quantocks.

      "bodyText": "When you climb the track past the disused quarry at Tiscombe and reach the ridge of the Quantocks, you suddenly find yourself on an ancient drove road between an avenue of twisted beech trees. Parts of the track are cut into the soil among shoulder-high roots. \"It's a sensational place,\" says Ewen Cameron. \"Sometimes there's mist swirling below in the valley, and you're up there above it, looking down on a white cloud. It's not hard to imagine the herds of animals being driven along the top to market in Taunton. \"I come from the north of Scotland and, when I first saw these hills in the mid-1970s, I was quite surprised. I thought, wow, Somerset's got it, too. And I knew that Wordsworth and Coleridge lived nearby and would have walked these hills, and that adds to the sense of history.\" From this southern starting point, Cameron's favourite walk takes him six miles along the ridge before he turns off and into Bicknoller, a place dear to his heart as chairman of the Countryside Agency: it's got a community-owned post office and shop, the kind of sustainable rural enterprise he's trying to encourage. \"You pass out of the beech trees through various gates into a rougher moorland area, with gorse and broom. Suddenly it seems much wilder and, on a clear day, the views are fantastic, right over the islands of the Bristol Channel and up into Wales. There's also Hinkley Point power station sitting there, very imposing, but not attractive. \"Behind, you look south to the Blackdown Hills and the Wellington Monument 15 or 20 miles away. It's when you get towards the northern end that you're likely to see the red deer that live here, near a place called Bicknoller Post and the woodland that runs down on the western side of the hills.\" Cameron owns the Dillington Estate, near Ilminster, 10 miles to the south of the Quantocks, and is a former president of the Country Landowners Association. He's married with four children and two labrador dogs, and some of them come with him on walks. \"I think what I get out of it is relaxation and spiritual uplift and just plain exercise - filling the lungs with air. If it contributes to problem-solving, it's by taking the mind off the problem for a few hours so you come back to it fresh.\" The Quantocks - from the earlier cantuc, believed to come from the Welsh word canto, meaning circle or rim - are one of the few places in Britain where the landscape looks much the same as it did 6,000 years ago. Neolithic settlers cleared the 1,000ft tops for grazing and they've stayed like that ever since, apart from a brief attempt to plough them in medieval times. Ten years ago, Somerset County Council fought off a proposal to put signs on the M5, and it's still official policy to avoid national publicity for the Quantocks. But they're well known for one of Britain's three remaining stag hunts, which takes to the hills on Mondays and Thursdays, eight months a year. The National Trust and the local councils have banned hunting from their land, but that still leaves 70% of the Quantocks where the hunt can pursue the 800 red deer.

      "body": "<p>The Georgians have a saying that if you throw a match into the ground in their country, it will grow back a tree. And the strange thing is, it's believable. Not just because the land is so rich that it effortlessly bears the most delicious produce, but because it is just as fertile in fairytales and legend. </p> <p>After a few hours in Georgia's capital, with its strange curly writing, its 20ft statues of its celebrated poets, its neither eastern nor western sense of place where cars roll up the hills due to magnetic forces and where people generally live to over 100, anything seems possible. </p> <p>The Tbilisi wonderland was waiting for me as I fell out of the caf\u00e9 Dukani on to Rustaveli Avenue, scene of running battles and sniper fire in the 1992-94 civil war. The buildings showed a few signs of the conflict - pock- marked or in states of disrepair - otherwise, it was hard to believe this place could be anything other than the bustling, exciting European-style town that it is. </p> <p>I stopped in a church and was mesmerised by outbursts of achingly-beautiful close harmonies sung by what seemed to be a spontaneous choir. Then, sidetracked by the shop windows, I ducked into a delicatessen to discover tubs of caviar for only 10 Lari (\u00a33.10). Tbilisi had got its claws into me, and I made for the flea market on the bank of the Mtkvari river, ready to part with more cash. </p> <p>There were strange objects and bargains: old Russian movie cameras, cooking implements, marvellous little treasures. Someone I mistook for a beggar offered me the sights from a sniper's rifle for 30 Lari (\u00a39.35). \"You can use it at the football to see better,\" he said. </p> <p>There is a memory of war here. But there is something much stronger and as ancient as the conflicts this country has felt: its culture - and its performance culture in particular. I was told that every third Georgian is an actor, if not every one, and their lust for life is evident and infectious, as is their desire to tell a story over a drink - or drinks. </p> <p>Their theatrical culture is impossible to ignore. There is almost every kind of theatre space imaginable, including the One Person Theatre, which has room for an audience of 20, and the puppet theatre, which seats more than 100 and has a beautiful wooden interior - it was staging the story of the Battle of Stalingrad with puppets (if you can picture it). </p> <p>Even though I didn't understand a single word of Georgian, I decided to take in a show at the magnificent Rustaveli theatre. This proved to be a good move: it was true spectacle and showed how vibrant Georgia's live performance world is. The theatre was filled with a cross-section of society - the young, the fashion conscious, the old, families, young couples - all as a community laughing and cheering at a Commedia Dell'Arte show. </p> <p>Stuffed with culture but starving hungry, I wandered through the old quarter of town to find a place to eat. Seeing I was lost, a passer-by took me to a restaurant, sat me down, had a word with the patron and said he would join me later for a drink. Food arrived at my table. Drink as well. The music being played in the corner of the bar on a duduk - an ancient Armenian instrument, a bit like an oboe - was plaintive and mesmerising. </p> <p>My friend returned and told me the tune being played had been dedicated to me as the bar's guest. As we drank, he told me a bit about himself in broken English. He was a jeweller and, later, he insisted on taking me to his studio over the road - a tiny workshop where he turned out cameo jewellery. I asked him what material he used to make the delicate thumbnail-sized pieces. \"Marmot\", he replied. What? \"Mar-mot,\" he re-emphasised with more volume and stress on the second syllable. Seeing I was still puzzled, he produced a huge tusk from under his work bench and showed me a picture of a woolly mammoth. </p> <p>He was making cameo jewellery out of woolly mammoth tusks from Siberia. I guess they are not endangered species any more, but that had to be illegal, and when I asked him where he got it from, he said he bought it over the internet from a dealer in Moscow. </p> <p>The next day I met my Georgian friend, Mamuka, at the baths. He told me that these hot sulphur springs gave the city its name. \"Tbili\" means warm, he said and then related the story of how the fifth-century Georgian king Vakhtang Gorgasali had been hunting in the forest and speared a pheasant. On recovering his quarry, he found the bird in a pool of hot water, cooked and ready to eat, or was it that the bird fell in the water was healed and flew away. Anyway, he was so impressed, that he moved his palace to the spot and made it the centre of his kingdom. </p> <p> 'P ushkin also came to these baths and so did Dumas,\" said Mamuka. \"You've got to try it.\" Pushkin's personal bathroom had a huge stone pool brimming with hot spring water. I immersed myself, relaxed and drank tea. It was the best way to prepare for Mamuka's vodka onslaught. </p> <p>Over a bottle of Eduard Shevardnadze peace vodka (yes, politician-branded booze), Mamuka explained to me the complexities of Geor gian toasting. First you drink to peace, he said, then the reason for gathering. To the host, to parents and ancestors, to friends, to those who are no longer with us, to the people here - individually and combined. The list seemed to go on and on, and with each toast a shot of vodka. </p> <p>After such toasts and then a few more, gathering friends on the way, Mamuka led us through the falling snow and narrow winding streets crammed with houses with carved wooden verandas to a cellar restaurant. Snug inside, we sat and ate and drank still more. The people at the next table, who looked as if they had left their Kalashnikovs at the door, toasted us, our families and our friends and pulled up their chairs. </p> <p>It was infectious and intoxicating, but I really couldn't drink any more. I couldn't eat any more, either. And the table was creaking under the weight of food to be dreamed about. Spinach chopped and crushed with walnuts sprinkled with fleshy pomegranate seeds, lobio - a dish of beans cooked in an earthenware pot - stewed pork, mushrooms seasoned with garlic, oil and dill, khachapuri - a bready pastry folded over and stuffed with melted cheese - and much more besides. </p> <p>The vodka tasted like wine and the Georgian wine tasted like honey. But it only took a piece of tomato and a slice of cucumber to betray why this country was called the breadbasket of the Soviet Union. With no need for fertilisers, all the food is organic and even a staple salad tasted better than anything sun-ripened in the Mediterranean. </p> <p>Mamuka, with full Georgian hospitality, insisted on paying the bill.

      "bodyText": "New Father Thames? London's river, particularly between Westminster and Tower Bridge, is undergoing a radical renaissance. Urban meadows? Sprouting waterside museums, engineering triumphs, new hotels, remodelled performance venues, riverside restaurants and a host of other pleasure zones. So the Dome, bless it . . . . . . is simply the first of a host of grand millennium projects. The seismic eye of the transformation? Is the London Eye. A funride with a glorious view, perhaps, but also a masterwork of engineering. Looking down on the new London mayor? Too late. County Hall now contains two hotels, Britain's best aquarium, a Namco Station games centre and a \"Hall of Fame\" devoted to the story of FA Premier League. That'll get the children going. So will the BFI Imax on Waterloo's roundabout. This glass drum of a structure houses the tallest - 60ft - screen in Britain. A regular South Bank Show. Drink to it at Vinopolis, an audio-visual \"world of wine\" attraction, with tastings and two restaurants. For culture, not viticulture? Get ye to the Globe, that faithful reconstruction of an Elizabethan theatre, for the largest exhibition on the Bard ever staged, scheduled to open this month. What's your favourite? On May 18 the cultural shrine will be unveiled. Eye, eye . . . No, a \u00a3134-million, glass-lidded conversion of the old Bankside Power Station, destined to be a model of born-again creativity. Apart from the name. As the Tate Modern, it will house Picasso, Monet, Matisse, Mondrian, Rothko, Dali, Bacon, Giacometti, Pollock, Warhol et al. Has there been a new wave of investment in boats? City Cruises' four 500-passenger, \u00a31.25-million \"riverliners\" are all called Millennium something. The South Bank complex is still a mess. Plan B is to transform the entire area into a single set piece of design. Who's paying for all this? The Lottery has provided much of the seed money, but the row of crops now has a momentum that will sustain life on the Thames way beyond the year 2000.",

      "body": "<p>Last year I spent a great deal more time in Italy than anywhere else, but on reflection it's clear to me that I wasn't really in Italy, but in a country of my own imagination. Film directors are thieves; magpies. They resemble barbarians bringing home the spoils, ransacking each city for its treasures. They plunder landscapes, corrupt geography, redraw maps, and invent villages. Screenplays, too, are notoriously hieroglyphic. They resemble architects' blueprints and collide with many of the same practical obstacles when translating ideas into reality. </p> <p>In my screenplay of The Talented Mr Ripley, adapted from Patricia Highsmith's mordant 1950s novel of the same name, Tom Ripley (played by Matt Damon), a young American misfit, is sent to Italy to persuade Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), the errant son of a wealthy industrialist, to return home to New York. Instead, he becomes obsessed with the glamorous life Dickie is leading in Mongibello and stays on, first befriended and then rejected by Dickie and his fianc\u00e9e, Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow). Eventually, Ripley assumes Dickie's identity and takes himself to Rome and Venice where, as is often the case with holidays, he samples the life he's always wanted. </p> <p>His catastrophic adventure begins innocuously enough with a blue Fiat bus, 1940s vintage, puttering along a coast road, Ripley inside, having hauled itself up from the harbour at Naples where the Queen Mary has just delivered him from New York. </p> <p>Collecting the half-dozen shots that create this sequence was less straightforward. The Queen Mary is long becalmed, the New York skyline irreparably altered by 50 years of vertical aspira tion. The once-majestic Arrivals Building in Naples is derelict and - most exercising to the film-makers - Mongibello, Ripley's destination, notionally situated on the Amalfi coast, is a figment of Highsmith's imagination. But there it all is on film. A departure from Manhattan, an arrival in a teeming hall of passengers, a short bus journey, a picturesque fishing village complete with villagers, fishermen, fish. And none of it, except perhaps for the fish, is real. </p> <p>So the Italy I explored for the past year is available to the traveller only through the distorted frames of a movie. I lived in the land of Ripley, and that mosaic of dream images, half-remembered moments from Italian movies, photographic references, travel diaries, documentaries and anecdotes, was my guidebook as I explored modern Italy and re-imagined it in the service of the film. </p> <p>The shooting of The Talented Mr Ripley, set in the Italy of 1958-9, was continuously confounded by progress: buildings mentioned in the adaptation were no longer there, or were hemmed in by modern neighbours or decorated with the ubiquitous green canvas of Rome's makeover for the millennial celebrations. In the 1950s, travel was largely the privilege of the moneyed class, and this had particular significance when it came to shooting in Italy's landmark locations: there were simply fewer peo ple then. We were faced with the problem of clearing piazzas swarming with tourists. </p> <p>By locating the movie a year or two later than the novel, there was an opportunity to explore a significant moment in Italian history, Il Boom, where a thin veneer of the modern, the sophistication of La Dolce Vita, had glossed but could not entirely hide the more primitive mores of the country. Italy is a place I love above all other places, but it's always possible to detect a darker note sounding under its breezy melodies. And this dissonance seemed to speak of the film itself: apparently sybaritic, but lounging on a volcano. Mongibello, as it happens, is a local name for Mount Etna. </p> <p>As Dickie, Ripley takes a suite in The Grand Hotel. This hotel has one of Rome's few genuinely impressive hotel exteriors and lobbies and so, for once, we were able to shoot an only semi-modified reality. But for Ripley's hotel suite we used the breathtaking interiors, frescoed and ornate, of the Palazzo Tiburna. The same building has a staircase of grim beauty, austere and colossal, like Escher's M\u00f6bius etchings. Here we filmed the halls and stairs of Ripley's Roman apartment, where bad things happen; while its evocative courtyard served as the exterior of an apartment belonging to Meredith Logue (played by Cate Blanchett), a young heiress with whom Ripley has become improba bly involved. It was possible, then, to walk out of a door, down some stairs and go outside, and have passed through three of the film's most significant locations, separated in the movie by weeks and miles. And so it went on. We filmed Roman locations in Naples, Neapolitan locations in Rome, Venetian locations in Sicily, sometimes by choice, mostly by force majeure . </p> <p>A key scene in Ripley's stay in Venice is a visit to his conductor friend Peter's rehearsal of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater in the composer's own church, La Pieta, a scene I wrote specifically because of the location. In fact, an earlier visit to a concert there actually gave me the idea for Peter Smith-Kingsley's occupation. Naturally, then, when it came to filming, the church became mysteriously unavailable. </p> <p>With the schedule tightening on us, we were faced with the prospect of having to shoot the scene in Palermo, Sicily, the next stop on our own journey. I couldn't scout a replacement church myself, and had to rely on a hastily-assembled selection of photographs. My eye was taken by images of the astonishing Byzantine gilt mosaic work in one of them, the 14th-century Chiesa Martorana. Its dazzling iconography of golden saints and angels seemed to offer a perfect backdrop to one of the film's few genuinely romantic moments. </p> <p>We arrived in Palermo the evening before we were due to film, only to discover that the mosaic work was confined to the rafters above the brooding monochrome of its walls. The church rehearsal would have photographed as if it took place in a large garage. The only solution I could think of, to the dismay of the production design team, was to take the performers to the mosaics. We built a terrifyingly rudimentary platform, and musicians and instruments were hoisted up. The camera has one eye; geography is only what the film establishes. Ripley enters the church, looks up to see Peter rehearsing Stabat Mater in what appears to be an organ loft. The audience can't see the glue and bits of string creating this illusion. </p> <p>Sometimes, of course, there is no simple line between fiction and fact. An elegantly-dressed woman approached us as we were preparing a caf\u00e9 exterior in Rome's Piazza di Spagna. There has never actually been an outdoor caf\u00e9 there, but I'd had an idea about Ripley observing his connivances from a high vantage point, and the architecture of the Spanish Steps, with its view stretching past the piazza, lent itself perfectly to the mechanics of the scene. </p> <p>The woman ducked under our work ropes and sat at one of the prop tables, indifferent to the fact that there was no caf\u00e9, that the facade concealed a dress shop, and insisted she had arranged to meet her friend at Dinelli's. As I attempted to explain that the caf\u00e9 was in reality a film set, that Dinelli's had been the name of my aunt's caf\u00e9 at Ryde Esplanade, on the Isle of Wight, her friend arrived and they sat down and had their meeting, a little irascible at our failure to serve them coffee but otherwise perfectly content. </p> <p>This seems to be the contract that Romans have made with Rome generally. They have made accommodation with a city bristling with facades and gestures from Nero to Mussolini. They perch on the statues, argue at the fountains, slouch against antiquity, and eat lunch on steps that might have been carved by Michelangelo. </p> <p>As Italy reconciled itself to our foibles, we tried to reconcile ourselves to Italy's. Filming was often fraught. You can't shoot in this street on Monday morning unless you restrict the field of view to 180 degree. The building is undergoing sewerage repairs from 7am-10am and the owner has a birthday party in the afternoon. That pneumatic drill can't be silenced until after 6pm. A key location in Venice is suddenly not available when the clergy discover there's a murder in the film (hard to imagine how they view the Bible). Every day, to quote our wonderful Italian crew's shrugging words of explanation, is a casino. </p> <p>And yet I would rather spend an afternoon with an Italian than anybody else. They know certain things about the world. They know how to lean. They most certainly know how to eat. They stare particularly well. They mostly know how to dress. </p> <p>The search for Mongibello took me and Roy Walker, the film's production designer, on a loop around the perimeter of Italy, tracing its coastline with increasing frustration for the necessary constituents: a house with a terrace giving directly on to a harbour; a pungent sense of life unchanged for centuries; good beaches - in short, an undiscovered Italy. Starting at Portofino (too self-consciously glamorous), then taking the train that winds through the Cinque Terre, that rosary of vertical medieval towns on the country's outer thigh, exquisitely coloured like so many Klee landscapes, we eventually strayed as far south as Sicily. Italy has not cherished its past and has been cavalier, particularly on its coastline, with post-war building. The Amalfi coast, the obvious choice for Mongibello, was not suitable. The whole region is scarred by development, some of it excruciatingly misjudged, and many beautiful medieval towns, flanked by a single clogged road - Positano, Amalfi, Ravello - are suffocating under the accretions of garish holiday homes clustered round them like cheap baubles on an elegant neck. </p> <p>I was excited by the neighbouring volcanic islands of Lipari and Salina, off Sicily's northern coastline, but their inaccessibility, and the lack of a house or terrace sufficiently ostentatious for Dickie or of a real focus to their harbours, led us to surrender their austere charms for two other islands off the Gulf of Naples, Ischia and Procida, less admired sisters of glamorous Capri. From their complex geographies, we created a map of a small village, with Dickie's and Marge's respective houses at either end of a harbour, a beach, a church, a small piazza. The houses themselves were on Ischia, but the funnelled alleys and cobbled streets which connected them were shot on Procida. </p> <p>The process of witnessing, which I think of as a particular duty of the director, extends beyond observing the work of the actors in the film. A choreographer once told me that he began each day in the studio by writing down everything in his head and tossing the results into the bin, a kind of mental spring-cleaning. I try to observe the same exercise when arriving on set, abandoning the meticulous planning that pre-production has until that moment demanded, and telling myself that any obstacle is useful, every curse contains a blessing. This happened on several occasions in Ripley, not least in the circumstances surrounding an important scene in the movie, where a local girl, Silvana, secretly pregnant with Dickie's child, drowns herself for shame during a religious ceremony. </p> <p>While working on the screenplay in a monastery in Cetona, Tuscany, I had had a dream in which I had seen a statue of the Madonna surfacing in the sea, followed by the body of young woman. From this image a whole strand of the screenplay had developed, a calm surface broken by a death in the water, prefiguring what would happen later with Dickie. Now we were in Ischia, there seemed no appropriate place to stage the festival in a way that the American characters could have vantage of the event while remaining appropriately isolated from the rest of the community, whom I wanted present in the scene. </p> <p>During our location-scouting, Roy Walker and I stood on Dickie's terrace and decided to make the best of an eroded slipway that poked into a narrow cove next to the house but was altogether too small. On the back of an envelope we devised a plan to enlarge the scale of the celebra tion by surrounding the cove with fishing boats, imagining a festival in which the Madonna was blessing the harvest of fish, as if this Christian event had been written over a pagan one, an idea consonant with the notion that the American interlopers were reading only the surface of the world they had found themselves in and not its darker currents. The location seemed a necessary but unhappy compromise. </p> <p> A few weeks later, our art director arrived back in Rome with photographs and a painting. which corresponded almost exactly to the sketch on our envelope. When I asked where he'd found these references, he told me they'd come from Ischia, that the slipway was the very same we'd felt obliged to select. </p> <p>But I also examine the equivalent of the choreographer's trash. A year before filming, I had been invited to Capri to receive an award for what seemed no better reason than being in possession of an Italian surname. I went on the basis that it would be a good opportunity to visit the Amalfi coast and do some exploring. Afterwards, I was cajoled by the producer to go to a club on the island where he assured me there would be a terrific party. He introduced me to a young friend, darkly handsome and effervescent, who had turned up during the evening and together we drove to an extremely unprepossessing building. </p> <p>Inside we found a cave, throbbing with people, who burst into applause as the producer's friend appeared, chanting his name - Fiorello! Fiorello! - and practically carrying him on to the stage. It transpired that Fiorello is a national star. Struggling through the crowd, he jumped on to the stage, began a writhing impression of Michael Jackson, sang and danced. \"And now,\" he shouted, \"all the way from America [sic] to sing for you tonight, Anthony Minghella!\" </p> <p>I would love to report that this social wallflower declined, but I didn't. The atmosphere was contagious, and I found myself sharing a microphone, singing my heart out to a medley of songs. Somewhere during my intoxicating stint in the club I had found myself talking to a coven of Italy's celebrated singers, listened carefully to their advocacy of a famous 1950s song whose composer was also present, Tu Vuoi Fa l'Americano. </p> <p>It had long occurred to me as I struggled with the screenplay that at the heart of Tom Ripley's unease is the fear of not being chosen. It's one of the things that makes him human. I think everyone knows this feeling or its correlative, knows too that for each of us as we pass from child to adult is the essential recognition that we are alone, the essential desire that we yearn not to be alone. </p> <p>Music was to play a huge role in the film of Ripley, and here - in the incident at the Capri club - I had found a way for Ripley to make the first significant claim for Dickie's affection, through music, through being chosen to come up on stage in a jazz club in Naples. And so my own experience, barely mediated, literal even to the extent of casting Fiorello in the movie, having him use the same form of words for inviting Tom Ripley up on stage, found its way into the film in a moment of unadulterated pleasure, as he and Dickie and Fiorello jump and jive their way through Tu Vuoi Fa l'Americano, a song about Italians wanting to be American, in a film about Americans wanting to be Italian. </p> <p>In a sense, the blatantly fictional landscape of Italy created to serve Ripley's story provides only a more noisy broadcast of what each traveller experiences. Just as a reader projects an internal and unique film of the novel he or she is reading - imagining rooms, faces, gestures - so the traveller brings home from each journey a landscape that is selective and personal, influenced by expectation, mood, the weather, a romantic encounter, a great meal, a terrible one. </p> <p>As tourists, we pay attention with a rigour that would paralyse us at home. The man who passes Trafalgar Square every day without looking at it is the same man who carefully photographs the Bernini sculpture in Piazza Navona. And what is it about, this endless snapping and videoing, if not to prove we were there, to say that this is what we thought beautiful or significant, this is what we want to remember? Similarly, if the adapter of a novel aims to be the ideal reader, a passionate advocate of the source material, then the film director must attempt the same function as a witness to the world he finds himself in, collecting and marvelling, abandoned to subjectivity, the ideal tourist. </p> <p> <strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Follow in the footsteps of The Talented Mr Ripley with a Magic of Italy Holiday (020 8748 7575) to Ischia.

      "bodyText": "Last year I spent a great deal more time in Italy than anywhere else, but on reflection it's clear to me that I wasn't really in Italy, but in a country of my own imagination. Film directors are thieves; magpies. They resemble barbarians bringing home the spoils, ransacking each city for its treasures. They plunder landscapes, corrupt geography, redraw maps, and invent villages. Screenplays, too, are notoriously hieroglyphic. They resemble architects' blueprints and collide with many of the same practical obstacles when translating ideas into reality. In my screenplay of The Talented Mr Ripley, adapted from Patricia Highsmith's mordant 1950s novel of the same name, Tom Ripley (played by Matt Damon), a young American misfit, is sent to Italy to persuade Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law), the errant son of a wealthy industrialist, to return home to New York. Instead, he becomes obsessed with the glamorous life Dickie is leading in Mongibello and stays on, first befriended and then rejected by Dickie and his fianc\u00e9e, Marge Sherwood (Gwyneth Paltrow). Eventually, Ripley assumes Dickie's identity and takes himself to Rome and Venice where, as is often the case with holidays, he samples the life he's always wanted. His catastrophic adventure begins innocuously enough with a blue Fiat bus, 1940s vintage, puttering along a coast road, Ripley inside, having hauled itself up from the harbour at Naples where the Queen Mary has just delivered him from New York. Collecting the half-dozen shots that create this sequence was less straightforward. The Queen Mary is long becalmed, the New York skyline irreparably altered by 50 years of vertical aspira tion. The once-majestic Arrivals Building in Naples is derelict and - most exercising to the film-makers - Mongibello, Ripley's destination, notionally situated on the Amalfi coast, is a figment of Highsmith's imagination. But there it all is on film. A departure from Manhattan, an arrival in a teeming hall of passengers, a short bus journey, a picturesque fishing village complete with villagers, fishermen, fish. And none of it, except perhaps for the fish, is real. So the Italy I explored for the past year is available to the traveller only through the distorted frames of a movie. I lived in the land of Ripley, and that mosaic of dream images, half-remembered moments from Italian movies, photographic references, travel diaries, documentaries and anecdotes, was my guidebook as I explored modern Italy and re-imagined it in the service of the film. The shooting of The Talented Mr Ripley, set in the Italy of 1958-9, was continuously confounded by progress: buildings mentioned in the adaptation were no longer there, or were hemmed in by modern neighbours or decorated with the ubiquitous green canvas of Rome's makeover for the millennial celebrations. In the 1950s, travel was largely the privilege of the moneyed class, and this had particular significance when it came to shooting in Italy's landmark locations: there were simply fewer peo ple then. We were faced with the problem of clearing piazzas swarming with tourists. By locating the movie a year or two later than the novel, there was an opportunity to explore a significant moment in Italian history, Il Boom, where a thin veneer of the modern, the sophistication of La Dolce Vita, had glossed but could not entirely hide the more primitive mores of the country. Italy is a place I love above all other places, but it's always possible to detect a darker note sounding under its breezy melodies. And this dissonance seemed to speak of the film itself: apparently sybaritic, but lounging on a volcano. Mongibello, as it happens, is a local name for Mount Etna. As Dickie, Ripley takes a suite in The Grand Hotel. This hotel has one of Rome's few genuinely impressive hotel exteriors and lobbies and so, for once, we were able to shoot an only semi-modified reality.

      "body": "<p>I feel bad about myself for feeling bad about Sydney. I was only there for a weekend, and this was my first visit. First time to Australia, in fact. </p> <p>Unsure what to do, I found myself handing over a tuckerbag full of dollars to make the vertiginous climb across the very top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. I rode the characterful green-and-cream ferries that ply beneath it. I gawped at the alien spaceship underbellies of giant rays in the dreamlike new harbourside aquarium. I trekked listlessly around fashionable Paddington and King's Cross feeling that I ought to see something of hot and happening Sydney. Yet, I felt as out of place as a wombat would clinging to an oak tree in the New Forest. </p> <p>Trouble is, I'd been spoiled rotten by the experience of being in the Northern Territory. There, I met people I never thought I'd meet, encountered animals, nose to snout, I'd only seen before in books. I trekked through landscapes where the colour of the soil, the fronds of plants (where there is plantlife), the profile of trees, the texture of clouds, the insects I tried to keep away from my trouser legs, the food I ate and the croc-infested waters I bathed in were all like nothing I'd experienced before. </p> <p>Strangely, I felt quite at home in the Aboriginal lands of the northern outback. I could have stayed for months. Sydney - a stop-off on the way home via New Zealand and the Cook Islands - held no appeal after my journey through trackless lands alongside the Roper River. I'm sure it would have in other circumstances. </p> <p>Mike Keighley, a real-life Crocodile Dundee with a practical sensitivity to the people, wildlife and places of his native patch of Australia, was the man who ensured I felt at home. Mike runs a travel outfit that specialises in setting up one-off, custom-made holidays and adventures for visitors to the Australian outback who wish to experience the \"real thing\", but, like me, have no real idea of what the \"real thing\" is. </p> <p>But, like so many people who come this way, I hoped to meet some of the Aborigines who live in the Northern Territory on their own terms, although I imagined that they would probably prefer not to meet yet another \"white fellah\" in search of gratuitous adventure among the \"black fellahs\". </p> <p>My first attempts to experience Aboriginal culture met, in my own terms, with failure. From Darwin, I flew to Bathhurst Island on a day trip to meet the Tiwi people. They couldn't have been more friendly, yet I felt like some dumb visiting dignatory. I was shown how to make \"damper\" (bush bread) and billy tea, watched a dance or two, was driven out to an ancestral burial ground, saw the sea and came back again. </p> <p>I felt like asking my patient guides \"with their permanent smiles\" how long had they been here (40,000 years probably), where they came from (Papua New Guinea?) and what exactly they did (hunt, dance, play football, surf the net, get on with their lives when the tourists go back to their air-conditioned hotels on the mainland). </p> <p>My dream would have been to trek across these all but virgin islands, to sleep out on the deserted white beaches under the stars as the Tiwi people do themselves. Who wouldn't want to on an underpopulated island as beautiful as Bathurst? Yet, why would the Tiwi people want me hanging around? </p> <p>Back to Darwin, where the local art museum tells you more about Aboriginal ways of life, art and culture in a few superbly-arranged galleries than a day here or there on flying visits to the people themselves ever could. I fell completely under the spell of Aboriginal art, a living tradition in the Northern Territory. </p> <p>Two hundred miles south at Katherine airport, enter Mike Keighley in a Mitsubishi 4WD pick-up, unpainted aluminium boat with outboard motor bobbing behind on a trailer and a gang of young Aborigines who he dropped off in out of the way places on our drive through the 32F heat along the Stuart Highway. </p> <p>This is the one metalled road that connects the north and south coast through central Australia via Alice Springs. Left and right, there appears to be nothing, or at least not on the map. Out of the shimmering heat haze, at five-minute intervals, one road-train after another blasts past, klaxons blaring. These are the vast International and Mack trucks that rock'n'roll across the outback, leaving a trail of squished wildlife in their wake. We were off to see Mike's friends some way south and east of Mataranka and well off the Stuart Highway. Mike, a bit of a school drop-out, was \"adopted\" a long while back by the indigenous tribes of the Aboriginal homelands that stretch for days along the banks of the Roper River and up into Arnhem Land. </p> <p>As a tourist, you need permits to head off the highway into these prohibited areas, which comprise half the land mass of the vast Northern Territory. Applications are sent via the territorial government in Darwin to the tribes themselves who may or may not give their assent. And why should they? Outsiders haven't exactly done much to endear themselves to Aboriginal Australians over the past 200 years. Although the majority of Aborigines in the Northern Territory live in towns, many have gone back out into the bush where they can pursue their own way of life undisturbed. </p> <p>Mike drives straight past signs warning visitors that they're entering prohibited lands and on into the ultimately roadless, trackless wilderness that forms most of the all-but-uninhabited Northern Territory. He tells me as we wind through a magical landscape dominated by giant termite's nests, that the 35,000 or so Aborigines in the Territory speak about 40 languages between them. These can be as different as Italian is from Cantonese. Most people speak five or six. The languages are infiltrated with pidgin English and you'll find young men with names like Petrol, Dieselmotor and Applemac along with women named, after the influence of Christian missionaries, Erica, Christine and Sheila, which we do. </p> <p>Down we plunged to a dusty village, past piles of beer cans (\"the men come out to booze on Friday nights,\" says Mike; \"they've prohibited alcohol in the village itself.\" The village is Jilminghan, a former cattle ranch near Elsey Station where Jeannie Gunn, the pioneer and novelist, lived and wrote her famous outback novel, We of the Never Never. It's a book as endearing to the Northern Territorians as The Virginian is to cowboys in Wyoming, the least populated of the US states. It was made into a feature film, with a little help from Jilminghan people in 1981. </p> <p>The Mangarrayi men, whose village Jilminghan is, are away hunting. The children are at morning school. They're learning their own language when Erica, Christine and Sheila take me to say hello. \"Jirr ka-nga jaykin\" (\"I'm standing\"), they chant. \"Ka-nga kurlaj ma\" (\"I'm shaking from side to side\"). \"Ka-mga ngorrony ma\" (\"I'm wriggling\"). Two naked teenagers are sitting at computer screens, solar-powered, in a trailer alongside. They're studying for the equivalent of their A-levels via a link-up with the University of Darwin. While the men stick and shoot pigs, lizards and kangaroos out in the bush, their children are wired into the latest technology. </p> <p>Jilminghan is a very long way from the tourist, day-trip stuff I'd seen. I like the fact that the corrugated houses built with grants from Darwin are barely lived in. The kitchens are unused; most of the rooms are used as storage and shelter when the rains eventually come. </p> <p>We push Mike's boat out, waist deep in snakey ooze, into the Roper River near the village, and set off upstream to bathe naked in the natural jacuzzis that line the river banks. Kingfishers, red- tailed kites, black cockatoos and untold wings of budgerigars fly overhead and into the tropical treescape. Crocodiles lurk. \"These are freshwater crocs,\" says Mike, \"so, no worries. But, you do get salties [saltwater crocs] up here some days. That's when we need our steel bathing trunks.\" </p> <p>This is a magical world, way off the tourist track. It gets much better when we return to pick up the village women and some of the teenagers after school to go off in search of bush-tucker (berries, roots, lizards, witchety grubs, whatever) and to link up with the men. We drive for a long, long way, bouncing through endless vistas of man-high termite nests. All I have to do to be accepted is be there, quietly, and then go shooting \"piggies\" with Mike. We kill two feral pigs and tie them on top of the boat bumping along behind us. \"Good tucker,\" says Erica. Now we're all firm friends. The new \"white fellah\" is okay because he's with Mike and because he doesn't keep taking pictures. </p> <p>Eventually, we run out of reliable ground to drive on. There is much consternation as to whether \"piggies still there\". They are. The vehicle is abandoned and we just walk, and walk, as the women collect food. And this, aside from cooking the piggies whole on an earth oven, singing, staring on my back at the infinite southern stars, is more or less how we spend our time. </p> <p>How long, I don't know. Who cares what day it is? I learn about dances and Dreamtime and whose spiritual ancestor is a barking owl, whose a magpie, snake or caterpillar. I can't play the didgeridoo. In tourist shops and markets this is a beautiful, crafted instrument made, as it's meant to be, of a eucalyptus tree branch hollowed out by termites and with a honeybee wax mouthpiece. The local boys make do with plastic drainpipes they've bought in Woolworths on a rare trip hitch-hiking north to Katherine. The smart ones, are \"for tourist fellahs\". </p> <p>Joining the men dragging whole Brahmin cows behind their 4WD pick-ups - really good bush-tucker: organic and free from BSE - I realised how much I'd changed in a just a few days before Mike drove me back to Katherine. As we walked into the local motel bar and restaurant looking like extras from The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith, a smart young Sydney woman (said so on her bag) sniffed \"cowboys\" as her boyfriend toyed with a green salad. Not that we stank, the climate's too dry for that, but we did look as if we'd just come back from walkabout. Which we had. </p> <p>I'd go back to the Northern Territories, sports, at the drop of an Akubra hat. Still feel crook about Sydney though. Well, not that crook. </p> <p><strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p>Air New Zealand (020 8741 2299) flies daily from Heathrow to Sydney, via LA.

Unsure what to do, I found myself handing over a tuckerbag full of dollars to make the vertiginous climb across the very top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. I rode the characterful green-and-cream ferries that ply beneath it. I gawped at the alien spaceship underbellies of giant rays in the dreamlike new harbourside aquarium. I trekked listlessly around fashionable Paddington and King's Cross feeling that I ought to see something of hot and happening Sydney. Yet, I felt as out of place as a wombat would clinging to an oak tree in the New Forest. Trouble is, I'd been spoiled rotten by the experience of being in the Northern Territory. There, I met people I never thought I'd meet, encountered animals, nose to snout, I'd only seen before in books. I trekked through landscapes where the colour of the soil, the fronds of plants (where there is plantlife), the profile of trees, the texture of clouds, the insects I tried to keep away from my trouser legs, the food I ate and the croc-infested waters I bathed in were all like nothing I'd experienced before. Strangely, I felt quite at home in the Aboriginal lands of the northern outback. I could have stayed for months. Sydney - a stop-off on the way home via New Zealand and the Cook Islands - held no appeal after my journey through trackless lands alongside the Roper River. I'm sure it would have in other circumstances. Mike Keighley, a real-life Crocodile Dundee with a practical sensitivity to the people, wildlife and places of his native patch of Australia, was the man who ensured I felt at home. Mike runs a travel outfit that specialises in setting up one-off, custom-made holidays and adventures for visitors to the Australian outback who wish to experience the \"real thing\", but, like me, have no real idea of what the \"real thing\" is. But, like so many people who come this way, I hoped to meet some of the Aborigines who live in the Northern Territory on their own terms, although I imagined that they would probably prefer not to meet yet another \"white fellah\" in search of gratuitous adventure among the \"black fellahs\". My first attempts to experience Aboriginal culture met, in my own terms, with failure. From Darwin, I flew to Bathhurst Island on a day trip to meet the Tiwi people. They couldn't have been more friendly, yet I felt like some dumb visiting dignatory. I was shown how to make \"damper\" (bush bread) and billy tea, watched a dance or two, was driven out to an ancestral burial ground, saw the sea and came back again. I felt like asking my patient guides \"with their permanent smiles\" how long had they been here (40,000 years probably), where they came from (Papua New Guinea?) and what exactly they did (hunt, dance, play football, surf the net, get on with their lives when the tourists go back to their air-conditioned hotels on the mainland). My dream would have been to trek across these all but virgin islands, to sleep out on the deserted white beaches under the stars as the Tiwi people do themselves. Who wouldn't want to on an underpopulated island as beautiful as Bathurst? Yet, why would the Tiwi people want me hanging around? Back to Darwin, where the local art museum tells you more about Aboriginal ways of life, art and culture in a few superbly-arranged galleries than a day here or there on flying visits to the people themselves ever could. I fell completely under the spell of Aboriginal art, a living tradition in the Northern Territory. Two hundred miles south at Katherine airport, enter Mike Keighley in a Mitsubishi 4WD pick-up, unpainted aluminium boat with outboard motor bobbing behind on a trailer and a gang of young Aborigines who he dropped off in out of the way places on our drive through the 32F heat along the Stuart Highway. This is the one metalled road that connects the north and south coast through central Australia via Alice Springs. Left and right, there appears to be nothing, or at least not on the map. Out of the shimmering heat haze, at five-minute intervals, one road-train after another blasts past, klaxons blaring. These are the vast International and Mack trucks that rock'n'roll across the outback, leaving a trail of squished wildlife in their wake. We were off to see Mike's friends some way south and east of Mataranka and well off the Stuart Highway. Mike, a bit of a school drop-out, was \"adopted\" a long while back by the indigenous tribes of the Aboriginal homelands that stretch for days along the banks of the Roper River and up into Arnhem Land. As a tourist, you need permits to head off the highway into these prohibited areas, which comprise half the land mass of the vast Northern Territory. Applications are sent via the territorial government in Darwin to the tribes themselves who may or may not give their assent. And why should they? Outsiders haven't exactly done much to endear themselves to Aboriginal Australians over the past 200 years. Although the majority of Aborigines in the Northern Territory live in towns, many have gone back out into the bush where they can pursue their own way of life undisturbed. Mike drives straight past signs warning visitors that they're entering prohibited lands and on into the ultimately roadless, trackless wilderness that forms most of the all-but-uninhabited Northern Territory. He tells me as we wind through a magical landscape dominated by giant termite's nests, that the 35,000 or so Aborigines in the Territory speak about 40 languages between them. These can be as different as Italian is from Cantonese. Most people speak five or six. The languages are infiltrated with pidgin English and you'll find young men with names like Petrol, Dieselmotor and Applemac along with women named, after the influence of Christian missionaries, Erica, Christine and Sheila, which we do. Down we plunged to a dusty village, past piles of beer cans (\"the men come out to booze on Friday nights,\" says Mike; \"they've prohibited alcohol in the village itself.\" The village is Jilminghan, a former cattle ranch near Elsey Station where Jeannie Gunn, the pioneer and novelist, lived and wrote her famous outback novel, We of the Never Never. It's a book as endearing to the Northern Territorians as The Virginian is to cowboys in Wyoming, the least populated of the US states. It was made into a feature film, with a little help from Jilminghan people in 1981. The Mangarrayi men, whose village Jilminghan is, are away hunting. The children are at morning school. They're learning their own language when Erica, Christine and Sheila take me to say hello. \"Jirr ka-nga jaykin\" (\"I'm standing\"), they chant. \"Ka-nga kurlaj ma\" (\"I'm shaking from side to side\"). \"Ka-mga ngorrony ma\" (\"I'm wriggling\"). Two naked teenagers are sitting at computer screens, solar-powered, in a trailer alongside. They're studying for the equivalent of their A-levels via a link-up with the University of Darwin. While the men stick and shoot pigs, lizards and kangaroos out in the bush, their children are wired into the latest technology. Jilminghan is a very long way from the tourist, day-trip stuff I'd seen. I like the fact that the corrugated houses built with grants from Darwin are barely lived in. The kitchens are unused; most of the rooms are used as storage and shelter when the rains eventually come. We push Mike's boat out, waist deep in snakey ooze, into the Roper River near the village, and set off upstream to bathe naked in the natural jacuzzis that line the river banks. Kingfishers, red- tailed kites, black cockatoos and untold wings of budgerigars fly overhead and into the tropical treescape. Crocodiles lurk. \"These are freshwater crocs,\" says Mike, \"so, no worries. But, you do get salties [saltwater crocs] up here some days. That's when we need our steel bathing trunks.\" This is a magical world, way off the tourist track. It gets much better when we return to pick up the village women and some of the teenagers after school to go off in search of bush-tucker (berries, roots, lizards, witchety grubs, whatever) and to link up with the men. We drive for a long, long way, bouncing through endless vistas of man-high termite nests. All I have to do to be accepted is be there, quietly, and then go shooting \"piggies\" with Mike. We kill two feral pigs and tie them on top of the boat bumping along behind us. \"Good tucker,\" says Erica. Now we're all firm friends. The new \"white fellah\" is okay because he's with Mike and because he doesn't keep taking pictures. Eventually, we run out of reliable ground to drive on. There is much consternation as to whether \"piggies still there\". They are. The vehicle is abandoned and we just walk, and walk, as the women collect food. And this, aside from cooking the piggies whole on an earth oven, singing, staring on my back at the infinite southern stars, is more or less how we spend our time. How long, I don't know. Who cares what day it is? I learn about dances and Dreamtime and whose spiritual ancestor is a barking owl, whose a magpie, snake or caterpillar. I can't play the didgeridoo. In tourist shops and markets this is a beautiful, crafted instrument made, as it's meant to be, of a eucalyptus tree branch hollowed out by termites and with a honeybee wax mouthpiece. The local boys make do with plastic drainpipes they've bought in Woolworths on a rare trip hitch-hiking north to Katherine. The smart ones, are \"for tourist fellahs\". Joining the men dragging whole Brahmin cows behind their 4WD pick-ups - really good bush-tucker: organic and free from BSE - I realised how much I'd changed in a just a few days before Mike drove me back to Katherine. As we walked into the local motel bar and restaurant looking like extras from The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith, a smart young Sydney woman (said so on her bag) sniffed \"cowboys\" as her boyfriend toyed with a green salad. Not that we stank, the climate's too dry for that, but we did look as if we'd just come back from walkabout. Which we had. I'd go back to the Northern Territories, sports, at the drop of an Akubra hat. Still feel crook about Sydney though. Well, not that crook.

It ended 230 down on the day at 9,862, its lowest point in 10 months. However, the prospect that the federal reserve - which has raised interest rates four times since last June - will again increase borrowing costs next month boosted US bond prices and the dollar </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite index, which had seesawed all day, slipped 27.16 points, to 4,590. Earlier, the technology-stacked index touched an intra-day high of 4,662.93. </p> <p>Yesterday's economic figures showed the US economy growing at an annualised rate of 6.9% in the final quarter of last year - well ahead of market expectations. </p> <p>Analysts had accounted for a 6.4% rate of growth. \"It definitely reveals unexpected vigour for the US economy in the final quarter and only enhances the likelihood of a rate hike at the March 21 meeting of the federal open market committee,\" according to John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investor Services in New York. </p> <p>\"The US economy is rocking\", was the reaction from Merrill Lynch economist Gerald Cohen. </p> <p>The continuing strength of the American economy is adding to fears that it will eventually feed through into inflation, forcing the fed to push rates higher. </p> <p>\"The stock market more and more is waking up to the realisation that two more interest rate hikes and perhaps three are being factored in,\" according to one market strategist. </p> <p>The boom in the American economy is being powered by consumer spending, which accounts for two thirds of all economic activity, higher government expenditure and higher business inventories as companies stock up in the belief that the spending spree will continue. </p> <p>The fed may not be too concerned by the fall in the Dow Jones. High share prices have helped Americans to feel wealthier and made them prepared to spend more and save less, keeping the consumer boom going. </p> <p>Lower share prices may help to check the heady growth rate bringing economic expansion back to levels the US central bank would view as more sustainable. </p> <p>But it will be concerned that the sell-off - which has seen the Dow Jones fall back 15% from the 11,700-point level in the middle of last month - does not turn into a rout. </p> <p>Financial markets are likely to remain jittery in the coming week with various economic data due to be released in the coming days.</p>",

      "bodyText": "US financial markets were last night bracing themselves for higher interest rates after figures showing the economy is continuing to power ahead. On Wall Street fears of dearer borrowing costs sent the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling through the 10,000 mark. It ended 230 down on the day at 9,862, its lowest point in 10 months. However, the prospect that the federal reserve - which has raised interest rates four times since last June - will again increase borrowing costs next month boosted US bond prices and the dollar Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite index, which had seesawed all day, slipped 27.16 points, to 4,590. Earlier, the technology-stacked index touched an intra-day high of 4,662.93. Yesterday's economic figures showed the US economy growing at an annualised rate of 6.9% in the final quarter of last year - well ahead of market expectations. Analysts had accounted for a 6.4% rate of growth. \"It definitely reveals unexpected vigour for the US economy in the final quarter and only enhances the likelihood of a rate hike at the March 21 meeting of the federal open market committee,\" according to John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investor Services in New York. \"The US economy is rocking\", was the reaction from Merrill Lynch economist Gerald Cohen. The continuing strength of the American economy is adding to fears that it will eventually feed through into inflation, forcing the fed to push rates higher. \"The stock market more and more is waking up to the realisation that two more interest rate hikes and perhaps three are being factored in,\" according to one market strategist. The boom in the American economy is being powered by consumer spending, which accounts for two thirds of all economic activity, higher government expenditure and higher business inventories as companies stock up in the belief that the spending spree will continue. The fed may not be too concerned by the fall in the Dow Jones. High share prices have helped Americans to feel wealthier and made them prepared to spend more and save less, keeping the consumer boom going. Lower share prices may help to check the heady growth rate bringing economic expansion back to levels the US central bank would view as more sustainable. But it will be concerned that the sell-off - which has seen the Dow Jones fall back 15% from the 11,700-point level in the middle of last month - does not turn into a rout. Financial markets are likely to remain jittery in the coming week with various economic data due to be released in the coming days.",

Not all policies offer the same levels of cover and prices can vary significantly.\" </p> <p>Through analysing single trip and annual travel policies from from more than 150 providers TRD found that the price differential in travel insurance can be staggering.

Protect is the provider's budget policy costing some 40% less than its super level 'Premium' policy with a \u00a340 excess on most claims. While Protect provides many of the same benefits as Premium, such as \u00a35m medical, \u00a32m personal liability, \u00a325,000 personal accident and \u00a3500 money, the premium saving is made by excluding cancellation and baggage cover.

The cover on this policy is comfortingly comprehensive including \u00a33m medical, \u00a32,500 cancellation or curtailment and \u00a31,500 baggage with a relatively high single article limit of \u00a3500. The only irritating thing about the Policy Partners site is that, unlike many other providers' sites, it does not provide a clear table of premium quotes for different policies and trips.

      "bodyText": "Holidaymakers and other travellers who book their flights and accommodation via the internet might consider adding travel insurance to their web-based purchases given the growing number of providers now selling their policies online. If you want to explore this route, you can save yourself time surfing between competitors looking for the best deals by checking out the latest findings from independent financial product analysts The Research Department (TRD). The results of an investigation into purchasing travel insurance in the UK through various distribution channels, including the internet, can be found on its website www.trd.co.uk together with useful \"best buy\" tables on single trip and annual cover policies and direct links into the websites of more than 30 online providers. Brian Brown, associate director of research at TRD, says: \"There is a bewildering range of travel insurance products available online and purchasers need to be careful about selecting the right product for their needs. Not all policies offer the same levels of cover and prices can vary significantly.\" Through analysing single trip and annual travel policies from from more than 150 providers TRD found that the price differential in travel insurance can be staggering. Holidaymakers buying their insurance from one source can pay almost eight times as much for the same cover through other sources. Cover levels also vary tremendously with some policies offering considerably more extras than others, sometimes for little extra premium, and often for lower premiums. The price you pay and the level of cover you get will also differ depending on the distribution channel you use. TRD says that, for example: \"while some tour operators' products provide excellent levels of cover, in many cases this is at the most expensive prices.

It is a plain, hinged wooden box with a drawer that still holds her tiny, wire-framed \"granny specs\". Its fascination lies purely in its link with her books, and in what it says about the way she wrote - perched at a table in a parlour, her papers easily hidden away.</p> <p>\u0095 The British Library (020-7412 7332), 96 Euston Road NW1, March 10 to October 15. Entry: adults \u00a33, concessions \u00a32, under 18s free.</p> <p>Like Jane Austen, the Bront\u00eb Sisters used portable wooden writing desks, propped on a table wherever there was time and space to write. Their home at Haworth still contains the three boxes Charlotte, Emily and Anne filled with little hoards of personal possessions.</p> <p>Charlotte's was polished rosewood with silver trim, held pens (quill and steel nibbed), seals and sealing wax, an invitation to a reception and a tiny book of devotions. Anne's was inlaid mahogany, lined in velvet, with brass fittings. Emily's, well-used and ink stained, held some Belgian bills, letters and coins, five newspaper reviews of Wuthering Heights and, most poignant of all, a letter from her publisher urging her not to send her second - now lost - novel till she was \"well satisfied with it\".</p> <p>\u0095 Bront\u00eb Parsonage (01535 642323), Haworth, Keighley, West Yorkshire BD22 8DR.

Adults \u00a34.50, concessions \u00a33.30, children (5-16) \u00a31.40.</p> <p>George Bernard Shaw, ever the rationalist, had a desk to write at, one to read at and another, possibly favourite, at the bottom of the garden. Fixed into a corner of his revolving summerhouse, it is a curiously flimsy little desk for such a heavyweight (but witty) dramatist, critic and writer. Alongside are his cane chair, wastepaper bin, fire and fold-away bed, where G (don't \"George\" me) BS would stretch out and think, or nap.</p> <p>What he was thinking during his 44 years at Shaw's Corner was nothing less than a political revolution (Brecht called him a terrorist who made humour his weapon) spelt out in thousands of articles, lectures and letters, as well as all the plays: Heartbreak House, Pygmalion (an Oscar-winning film even before it became My Fair Lady), Saint Joan, The Apple Cart and much more. When he died, 50 years ago this year, aged 94, he was still writing for the theatre.</p> <p>\u0095 Shaw's Corner (01438 820307), Ayot St Lawrence, Hertfordshire AL6 9BX.

The National Trust and RADA plan anniversary events in London and Shaw's Corner.</p> <p>Arthur Ransome claimed Swallows and Amazons \"almost wrote itself\". He'd fallen out with the family of children who inspired Swallow's crew and wanted to reclaim the book as his own childhood memories of the Lake District: \"No matter where I was, wandering about the world - in my mind's eye [I] could see the beloved skyline of great hills.\"</p> <p>His wanderings (war correspondent in Russia during the Revolution) and restless life mean there isn't a Ransome house to visit. But his widow, Evgenia (Trotsky's secretary when they met) gave his desk and prized possessions to the Museum of Lakeland Life in Kendal. It is kept on show in a special room surrounded by his fishing rods and pipes, sketchbooks and, photos, a Jolly Roger flag, and the chess set he used in Russia (to beat Lenin, once, he said).</p> <p>\u0095 Museum of Lakeland Life and Industry (01539 722464), Abbot Hall, Kendal, Cumbria LA9 5AL. Open daily Feb 10 - Dec 22. Entry: adults \u00a33, seniors \u00a32.80, children \u00a31.50, family \u00a37.50.</p> <p>Hugh MacDiarmid, Scotland's modern-day national poet, died 21 years ago. His home in the Borders, a basic, two-room labourer's cottage, looks as though he left it yesterday. The table he wrote at (always in foolscap, covering every inch of space) and most of the well-worn furniture came from second-hand sales at nearby Biggar; but it was better than the fruit-boxes the family used during their penniless stay in Shetland.</p> <p>\u0095 Brownsbank (01899 221050), Candy Mill, Biggar, Strathclyde. Open strictly by appointment. No charge, but donations welcome.</p> <p>Charles Dickens is too big a writer and character to have left just one desk. There seem to be half a dozen dotted around. One of the most famous is in the Dickens Centre at Rochester, the city Dickens knew from childhood, returned to once he'd made his fortune, and used as the backdrop for Great Expectations and Edwin Drood. The desk is part of a large-scale recreation of the portrait known as The Dream, in which Dickens sits daydreaming while his characters reappear around him.</p> <p>\u0095 The Charles Dickens Centre (01634 844176), Eastgate House, High Street, Rochester, Kent ME1 1EW.

      "bodyText": "The writing desk Jane Austen used to write Pride and Prejudice, Emma and Sense and Sensibility, will be shown for the first time next month when the British Library opens a new exhibition, Chapter and Verse: 1,000 years of English literature. If it steals the show from Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre manuscript or the Beatles' lyrics, it won't be due to size and splendour. It is a plain, hinged wooden box with a drawer that still holds her tiny, wire-framed \"granny specs\". Its fascination lies purely in its link with her books, and in what it says about the way she wrote - perched at a table in a parlour, her papers easily hidden away. \u0095 The British Library (020-7412 7332), 96 Euston Road NW1, March 10 to October 15. Entry: adults \u00a33, concessions \u00a32, under 18s free. Like Jane Austen, the Bront\u00eb Sisters used portable wooden writing desks, propped on a table wherever there was time and space to write. Their home at Haworth still contains the three boxes Charlotte, Emily and Anne filled with little hoards of personal possessions. Charlotte's was polished rosewood with silver trim, held pens (quill and steel nibbed), seals and sealing wax, an invitation to a reception and a tiny book of devotions. Anne's was inlaid mahogany, lined in velvet, with brass fittings. Emily's, well-used and ink stained, held some Belgian bills, letters and coins, five newspaper reviews of Wuthering Heights and, most poignant of all, a letter from her publisher urging her not to send her second - now lost - novel till she was \"well satisfied with it\". \u0095 Bront\u00eb Parsonage (01535 642323), Haworth, Keighley, West Yorkshire BD22 8DR. Open daily, Oct 1 - March 31, 11am - 5pm; April 1 - Sep 30, 10am - 5pm. Adults \u00a34.50, concessions \u00a33.30, children (5-16) \u00a31.40. George Bernard Shaw, ever the rationalist, had a desk to write at, one to read at and another, possibly favourite, at the bottom of the garden. Fixed into a corner of his revolving summerhouse, it is a curiously flimsy little desk for such a heavyweight (but witty) dramatist, critic and writer. Alongside are his cane chair, wastepaper bin, fire and fold-away bed, where G (don't \"George\" me) BS would stretch out and think, or nap. What he was thinking during his 44 years at Shaw's Corner was nothing less than a political revolution (Brecht called him a terrorist who made humour his weapon) spelt out in thousands of articles, lectures and letters, as well as all the plays: Heartbreak House, Pygmalion (an Oscar-winning film even before it became My Fair Lady), Saint Joan, The Apple Cart and much more. When he died, 50 years ago this year, aged 94, he was still writing for the theatre. \u0095 Shaw's Corner (01438 820307), Ayot St Lawrence, Hertfordshire AL6 9BX. Open April 1 -Oct 29, Wed -Sun. Adults \u00a33.50, children \u00a31.75, family \u00a38.75. The National Trust and RADA plan anniversary events in London and Shaw's Corner. Arthur Ransome claimed Swallows and Amazons \"almost wrote itself\". He'd fallen out with the family of children who inspired Swallow's crew and wanted to reclaim the book as his own childhood memories of the Lake District: \"No matter where I was, wandering about the world - in my mind's eye [I] could see the beloved skyline of great hills.\" His wanderings (war correspondent in Russia during the Revolution) and restless life mean there isn't a Ransome house to visit. But his widow, Evgenia (Trotsky's secretary when they met) gave his desk and prized possessions to the Museum of Lakeland Life in Kendal. It is kept on show in a special room surrounded by his fishing rods and pipes, sketchbooks and, photos, a Jolly Roger flag, and the chess set he used in Russia (to beat Lenin, once, he said). \u0095 Museum of Lakeland Life and Industry (01539 722464), Abbot Hall, Kendal, Cumbria LA9 5AL. Open daily Feb 10 - Dec 22. Entry: adults \u00a33, seniors \u00a32.80, children \u00a31.50, family \u00a37.50. Hugh MacDiarmid, Scotland's modern-day national poet, died 21 years ago. His home in the Borders, a basic, two-room labourer's cottage, looks as though he left it yesterday. The table he wrote at (always in foolscap, covering every inch of space) and most of the well-worn furniture came from second-hand sales at nearby Biggar; but it was better than the fruit-boxes the family used during their penniless stay in Shetland. \u0095 Brownsbank (01899 221050), Candy Mill, Biggar, Strathclyde. Open strictly by appointment. No charge, but donations welcome. Charles Dickens is too big a writer and character to have left just one desk. There seem to be half a dozen dotted around. One of the most famous is in the Dickens Centre at Rochester, the city Dickens knew from childhood, returned to once he'd made his fortune, and used as the backdrop for Great Expectations and Edwin Drood. The desk is part of a large-scale recreation of the portrait known as The Dream, in which Dickens sits daydreaming while his characters reappear around him. \u0095 The Charles Dickens Centre (01634 844176), Eastgate House, High Street, Rochester, Kent ME1 1EW. Open daily year round (except Christmas). Adults \u00a33.50, seniors and children \u00a32.50. Dylan Thomas called his bright-blue workshed at Laugharne \"The Shack\", a \"water and tree room on the cliff\". Seated at the simple red table, he could see the \"heron priested\" Taf Estuary spread out below, while he wrote - and re-wrote - Under Milk Wood and the lines to his dying father, Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night. His other desk, inherited from his father, stands in the parlour of the nearby Boat House, where he lived with Caitlin and their children. \u0095 Dylan Thomas Boat House (01994 427420), Laugharne, Carmarthenshire SA33 4SD. Open all year (except Christmas). Adults \u00a32.75, seniors \u00a31.75, children (7-14) \u00a31.

Open April 1 - Nov 1, Sat - Wed, open Good Friday. adults \u00a35, children \u00a32.50, family \u00a312.50. Lucy Boston always wrote in pencil at the dining-room table, facing the French windows where she fed the birds, and with her back to the huge hearth of her mysterious 12th-century home in the Fens. As everyone knows who grew up on The Children of Green Knowe, (or heard it broadcast last Christmas) this is where young Tolly finds himself inside - the ground floor of a castle - furnished with \"comfortable polished old-fashioned things as though living in castles was quite ordinary\". Except that great-grandma Oldknow and her ancient house turn out to be anything but ordinary. The polished old-fashioned table and chair where Lucy wrote, the attic filled with ghostly children's toys and the lovely moated gardens are kept exactly as she restored - and Tolly found - them. \u0095 The Manor (01480 463134), Hemingford Grey, Huntingdon PE18 9BN. Open year round by appointment. Adults \u00a34, seniors \u00a33.50, children \u00a31.50. Agatha Christie's typewriter, a 1937 Remington portable, takes pride of place among family photos, portraits, bits of porcelain, theatre programmes and early editions in the Agatha Christie Memorial Room in Torquay. Her desk isn't there, so this one is a cheat (so what: critics claimed The Murder of Roger Ackroyd had a \"rotten cheat ending\"), but the typewriter was more important.

Drummond and Cauty were dribbling old men in pyjamas, buzzing around the stage on electric wheelchairs with pathetically flaccid rhino horns taped to their heads while the PA blasted out the tune's message, \"Fuck the Millennium\". As Drummond explains here, the gig was an attempted suicide: \"The show was about the crapness of the comeback, of blowing one's own myth.\" </p> <p> 45 is a further attempt to bury the myth.

Soon it \"had not only become the theme tune of the station, but the anthem of the democracy movement... A track we recorded in a day, never released as a single, thought was crap and had forgotten about had taken on a meaning, an importance in a 'far-off land'.\" </p> <p>As Drummond surely knows, a myth like the KLF's is peculiarly omnivorous. Just as there can never be any evidence to disprove a conspiracy theory because the fabrication of such evidence - don't you see? - is itself part of the conspiracy, so the pop myth of the KLF can never be blown apart by anything they do, no matter how dumb or embarrassing. The myth will suck it up, like a black hole. </p> <p>And so with 45. At its best it has flashes of twisted brilliance reminiscent of Iain Sinclair or Will Self, but the majority is most interesting because the author was one half of the KLF.

Brian O'Dwyer, a legal expert, said he was not surprised at the verdict: \"I think there was no chance of a murder conviction as it came down.\" The turning point, he said, was when Carroll, the oldest of the officers and one of two who fired all 16 bullets from his 9mm handgun, broke down while giving evidence. \"I think the jury felt with this officer and decided that no punishment was appropriate. He was not swaggering as some policemen are on the stand,\" he added.",

He looked back at me with an expression of disbelief.</p> <p>\"You don't smoke?\" he checked.</p> <p>\"No,\" I said, and gave him a brief talk about the dangers of smoking, citing the Royal College of Physicians' latest report. I was interrupted by his wife, Peggy, shouting, \"'urry up, Vince, I'm bleedin' gaspin' 'ere\", from their doorstep.</p> <p>Two of their three big dogs escaped from the house and preceded to fight in my front garden. \"Satan! Devil!\" roared Ludlow. \"Get back in the 'ouse!\" </p> <p>The ill-trained animals ignored their master and carried on with their fight. Eventually, they were joined by the third dog, Kane, who entered the fray with evident enjoyment. Mrs Ludlow ran from the house with a sweeping brush and set about the dogs with the wooden handle. They were quickly subdued, and slunk back into the house with their tails between their powerful legs. \"Bleeders,\" said Ludlow, fondly, as he watched them go. I couldn't take my eyes off Peggy Ludlow: she was panting from her exertions, causing her magnificent bosom to rise and fall beneath her food-stained dressing gown. She looked like a beautiful, long-haired version of Ann Widdicombe. I felt my manhood stir for the first time in many months. <strong>Wednesday, February 16</strong></p> <p>This morning, I saw Peggy Ludlow in her back garden, hanging washing on the line. I splashed a little Ralph Lauren's Polo on to my cheeks and hurried down to my own garden, where I pretended to examine the tree. I glanced over the fence. Peggy was wearing full make-up, her raven hair was blowing in the wind. She held a clothes peg tantalisingly between her carmine lips. She nodded to me. </p> <p>\"Just looking at my tree,\" I croaked.</p> <p>\"The last bloke what lived in your 'ouse murdered his brother-in-law then 'ung himself from that tree,\" she said with obvious relish.

      "bodyText": "Tuesday, February 15, 2000, 12 Arthur Askey Way Vincent Ludlow, my next-door neighbour, knocked on my door at 11.30 tonight and asked if I could \"let him 'ave a few fags until the mornin'.\" I told him that I was a life-long non-smoker. He looked back at me with an expression of disbelief. \"You don't smoke?\" he checked. \"No,\" I said, and gave him a brief talk about the dangers of smoking, citing the Royal College of Physicians' latest report. I was interrupted by his wife, Peggy, shouting, \"'urry up, Vince, I'm bleedin' gaspin' 'ere\", from their doorstep. Two of their three big dogs escaped from the house and preceded to fight in my front garden. \"Satan! Devil!\" roared Ludlow. \"Get back in the 'ouse!\" The ill-trained animals ignored their master and carried on with their fight. Eventually, they were joined by the third dog, Kane, who entered the fray with evident enjoyment. Mrs Ludlow ran from the house with a sweeping brush and set about the dogs with the wooden handle. They were quickly subdued, and slunk back into the house with their tails between their powerful legs. \"Bleeders,\" said Ludlow, fondly, as he watched them go. I couldn't take my eyes off Peggy Ludlow: she was panting from her exertions, causing her magnificent bosom to rise and fall beneath her food-stained dressing gown. She looked like a beautiful, long-haired version of Ann Widdicombe. I felt my manhood stir for the first time in many months. Wednesday, February 16 This morning, I saw Peggy Ludlow in her back garden, hanging washing on the line. I splashed a little Ralph Lauren's Polo on to my cheeks and hurried down to my own garden, where I pretended to examine the tree. I glanced over the fence. Peggy was wearing full make-up, her raven hair was blowing in the wind. She held a clothes peg tantalisingly between her carmine lips. She nodded to me. \"Just looking at my tree,\" I croaked. \"The last bloke what lived in your 'ouse murdered his brother-in-law then 'ung himself from that tree,\" she said with obvious relish. I went back inside and phoned the homeless unit. I left a message on Pamela Pigg's voicemail, demanding an immediate transfer. Friday, February 18 Nigel came round tonight and brought me a bunch of Stargazer lilies. As he handed them to me, he said, \"Congratulations on finally coming out, Moley.\" After I had vehemently protested my heterosexuality, Nigel said, \"Well, I was told by a council worker that you had claimed on an official form that you were a gay single father.

In 1862, principal librarian Robert Smiles reported on the difficulties created by the American civil war; the cotton famine meant that mills stood empty, the unemployed crowded into the library. \"The accommodation in the reference library was found inadequate for the number of readers, every table being completely surrounded, and every chair occupied, a number of youths accommodating them selves on the warming pipes, where they were to be seen in rows on each side of the room every evening.\" He resolved the problem by opening a specially designated room for them. </p> <p>The library developed specialisms, all of which are peculiar to it, and most of which still exist (but are under threat) today. There is the technical library and the local history library (both dating back to 1852); the arts library (with theatre and gardening collections, Victorian fashion plates and samples books); the language and literature library (unique Gaskell and Broadside ballad collections); and, in the great glass-domed reading room, the social sciences library. </p> <p>I first ventured in when I was researching my novel, Mr Wroe's Virgins, set in 1830s Lancashire.

I didn't expect to have so much luck with my next novel, but Australia 1788 was no problem for central ref, and the index led me to books I didn't know existed, helping to define the subject of Promised Lands. </p> <p> Anthony Burgess probably got the best story out of research there. As a schoolboy he had trouble understanding the index and was helped by \"a charming woman running acceptably to fat\" who was reading about Engels. She left the library at the same time as he did, and on the steps invited him to tea. \"I needed, she said, to be educated.\" Back in her flat she produced tea and condoms, and \"gave me detailed instructions about love-making on the rug before the gas fire\". </p> <p>The Henry Watson music library plays a key role in Vikram Seth's latest novel, An Equal Music; the violinist hero from Rochdale, unable to afford to buy scores, has learned his craft there. Tony Warren, creator of Coronation Street, spent his teens bunking off school to haunt rehearsals in the library theatre. \"When they got round to shooing me away I simply went up to the vast, circular book-lined main hall above and I read and I read.\" </p> <p>Which is the point for everyone, from the uniformed pupils who descend at 4pm, hunting material for exam projects, to mature students like Salford gas-fitter Vincent McCabe, who did a politics degree part-time, and found that, for books and long opening hours, the library was: \"The place - you can't go anywhere else.\" </p> <p>And that is, sadly, true. You cannot use Manchester's university libraries unless you are a student or graduate; you cannot go anywhere else in the whole north of England for this range of materials and expertise.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I go to meet Mr Structuralism, who is visiting London, and find that his interest in literary theory has faded with the years. Tzvetan Todorov is the Bulgarian-born Director of Research at the Centre National de Recherches in Paris and has written a shelf a of influential books, including Litt\u00e9rature et Signification, and Les genres de discours. He has not come to talk about literary theory, however, but about a book he first published in Paris in 1991, Facing The Extreme: Moral Life In The Concentration Camps (Phoenix, \u00a37.99). </p> <p>Professor Todorov does not mind that, controversially, the \"concentration camps\" of his title means both the Nazi variety and those of Stalin's Gulag. Wasn't the human suffering much the same? But he understands why I find it odd that he looks for morality in such immoral places.</p> <p>\"Many of the witnesses - and my material is the narrative of the witnesses - start their narratives by claiming that there was no such thing as moral life in the concentration camps, that it was a place where every man was for himself, a wolf to other men, in a war of all against all, a Hobbesian world. Yet if you read the narratives themselves, in detail, you discover that this is not true and that, as one of them says, none of them would have survived without a helping hand. Of course moral life was not easy, but there was a moral life.\" </p> <p>He categorises moral life in the German and Soviet camps under the headings of caring, dignity, and the life of the mind. \"Not that they are universal categories, but they come out of the texts themselves. Of dignity: that is preserving one's self-respect, of remaining clean, or holding oneself straight, so that one wouldn't despise oneself. Of caring, which is of course the major moral act, and of which there are numberless examples, next to others in which a person takes the bread from the hand of an inmate and by this act kills him, because without bread there is no survival. This exists, but next to it there is the sharing of bread between people who hardly knew each other. </p> <p>\"Then of what I call the life of the mind, that is the simple interest for an abstract idea, for beauty, for something that was beyond the necessity for survival.\" He reminds me of the incident in Ravensbr\u00fcck, involving Milena Jesenska - Kafka's Milena - and Margarete Buber-Neumann. They found a Brueghel reproduction in a magazine, tore it out and tacked it to the wall; they saw this as \"a protest against our condition as prisoners\". \"Each time they had a free moment they would get together and look at the picture,\" Todorov says. \"And I think this is a moral act of affirming the dignity of human beings, who need not just food but something beyond it.\" </p> <p>Todorov's book will not be easy reading for those who want a simple message to come out of the suffering and death in German and Russian camps. \"I know that many people, the general reader perhaps, prefer clear-cut situations and black-and-white images. The black must remain black and the white must remain white. The victim should be an absolute victim and the executioner nothing but an executioner. I don't mean that the victims shouldn't be cherished, or that one shouldn't condemn the executioner. But to me that is not enough.</p> <p>\"My interest begins once that has been said. But they were not simply victims - it is only in the most extreme situations where the victim can do nothing but be killed or be tortured. Most of the time the victim has a a limited but certain range of possibly of action. That is why there is a moral life in the camps. </p> <p>\"And on the other side, since this is a book about ordinary evil as well as ordinary goodness, I think we must avoid this initial reaction, which is very common and very understandable, that the killers were monsters, totally different from us, that we have nothing to do with all that, they were demonic, or at least the incarnation of pure evil. In a way this thesis of [Daniel] Goldhagen, of 'exterminatory anti-Semitism', is another example of this. It is creating an essence that which would explain everything. And because of that essence, the people outside the essence feel they don't need to feel concerned at all.\" </p> <p>Todorov, who grew up in totaliatarian Bulgaria and came to Paris in 1963, cannot look at history without making judgments. His \"post-structuralist\" writing has challenged those who over-simplify history or who refuse to see the good and the bad in it. \"In the Middle Ages one spoke of exempla. History was a collection of stories which make you think about values. I don't think that even when we are writing history in the most objective way we are really refraining from judgment, but I think that judgment is buried in the way the material is organised and selected. There is always a thesis. Otherwise it is just a chronicle. </p> <p>\"History necessarily has a view of the good. But we feel ashamed to name it because our whole idea of the humanities has been to think we should eliminate everything subjective, every value judgment. I don't think we really manage that well. Because of this we frequently produce unreadable books. It is a strange genre. Maybe that is why we listen so much to novelists and poets - because they have remained full human beings rather than eliminating a large part of their sensibility.\"</p>",

Of course moral life was not easy, but there was a moral life.\" He categorises moral life in the German and Soviet camps under the headings of caring, dignity, and the life of the mind. \"Not that they are universal categories, but they come out of the texts themselves. Of dignity: that is preserving one's self-respect, of remaining clean, or holding oneself straight, so that one wouldn't despise oneself. Of caring, which is of course the major moral act, and of which there are numberless examples, next to others in which a person takes the bread from the hand of an inmate and by this act kills him, because without bread there is no survival. This exists, but next to it there is the sharing of bread between people who hardly knew each other. \"Then of what I call the life of the mind, that is the simple interest for an abstract idea, for beauty, for something that was beyond the necessity for survival.\" He reminds me of the incident in Ravensbr\u00fcck, involving Milena Jesenska - Kafka's Milena - and Margarete Buber-Neumann. They found a Brueghel reproduction in a magazine, tore it out and tacked it to the wall; they saw this as \"a protest against our condition as prisoners\". \"Each time they had a free moment they would get together and look at the picture,\" Todorov says. \"And I think this is a moral act of affirming the dignity of human beings, who need not just food but something beyond it.\" Todorov's book will not be easy reading for those who want a simple message to come out of the suffering and death in German and Russian camps. \"I know that many people, the general reader perhaps, prefer clear-cut situations and black-and-white images. The black must remain black and the white must remain white. The victim should be an absolute victim and the executioner nothing but an executioner. I don't mean that the victims shouldn't be cherished, or that one shouldn't condemn the executioner. But to me that is not enough. \"My interest begins once that has been said. But they were not simply victims - it is only in the most extreme situations where the victim can do nothing but be killed or be tortured. Most of the time the victim has a a limited but certain range of possibly of action. That is why there is a moral life in the camps. \"And on the other side, since this is a book about ordinary evil as well as ordinary goodness, I think we must avoid this initial reaction, which is very common and very understandable, that the killers were monsters, totally different from us, that we have nothing to do with all that, they were demonic, or at least the incarnation of pure evil. In a way this thesis of [Daniel] Goldhagen, of 'exterminatory anti-Semitism', is another example of this. It is creating an essence that which would explain everything. And because of that essence, the people outside the essence feel they don't need to feel concerned at all.\" Todorov, who grew up in totaliatarian Bulgaria and came to Paris in 1963, cannot look at history without making judgments. His \"post-structuralist\" writing has challenged those who over-simplify history or who refuse to see the good and the bad in it. \"In the Middle Ages one spoke of exempla. History was a collection of stories which make you think about values. I don't think that even when we are writing history in the most objective way we are really refraining from judgment, but I think that judgment is buried in the way the material is organised and selected. There is always a thesis. Otherwise it is just a chronicle. \"History necessarily has a view of the good. But we feel ashamed to name it because our whole idea of the humanities has been to think we should eliminate everything subjective, every value judgment. I don't think we really manage that well. Because of this we frequently produce unreadable books. It is a strange genre. Maybe that is why we listen so much to novelists and poets - because they have remained full human beings rather than eliminating a large part of their sensibility.\"",

Oscar Wilde, when asked why he spent his time with such a drunk, replied that it was unfortunate not that this poet should be drunk but that more drunks were not poets. </p> <p>Dowson was a man of febrile sexual energy: when he could afford it he would have a woman (mainly prostitutes) each night.

His family was not poor when he was born, but became increasingly impoverished throughout his childhood as they travelled around continental resorts in an attempt to cure his parents' tuberculosis.

When Wilde was disgraced and imprisoned with hard labour, the best hopes of the decadent movement of which Dowson was a major figure were destroyed. </p> <p>Dowson never had a relationship with a woman who could be considered his equal in intellect or age; he fell in love with Adelaide, the daughter of a Soho restaurant proprietor, when she was 12 and he was 22. Most of his best work was dedicated to her - \"you, who are my verses\" - but the over-sensitive poet was no kind of partner.

In the chapter headed \"daughters\", she visits the notorious part of Blake Morrison's As If where he describes his infant daughter's body, pretty much all of it, in terms which caused something of a fuss, and points out that to look at a young girl in this way is another way of refusing to see a person: \"scrumptious, sensual and irrational while denying their present reality...

The other point is that this is not, I feel, a fair reading of Morrison. It has to be said: Greer is not fair; and this isn't a quality we should seek from her. I have a few friends and colleagues - most of them women - who have been publicly vilified or even sued by Greer, and, if it were not so obviously fighting talk, I would be tempted to say that she is one of those people who can dish it out - boy, does she dish it out - but can't take it. </p> <p>But that's not a good enough reason to dismiss her.

This book offers a defence of Nato's remote-control zapper war against the war criminal in Belgrade, but is alert to the heavy moral questions it raised. </p> <p>He is struck by the unreality of the war in Kosovo - how the western public saw it as a succession of videogame images, targets coming into focus through a nose-cone camera and then fading to fuzz. He sees a shallow war, in which the western public can watch its servicemen fight with impunity. The central question is simple. Does the wholesale abuse of human rights in one state permit other states to fight a war to stop that abuse? </p> <p>You might think that the doctrine of non-interference went out with the Holocaust, but Ignatieff has a dialogue with Robert Skidelsky where the two knock this one around. Skidelsky writes: \"Blair takes direct issue with the prudential tradition of diplomacy. 'Bismarck,' he remarked, 'famously said that the Balkans were not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier.'

Nato saved lives.

Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney had long before carefully warned everyone to \"Be advised my passport's green / No glass of ours was ever raised / To toast the Queen\", making his Irish republicanism clear. </p> <p>Tony Harrison, roused at even the mention of his name in the papers, faxed the Guardian with \"Laureate's Block\", a hubristic poem outlining not merely his English republicanism but his adulterous relationship with a younger woman, his dislike of Andrew Motion and his need to be free to \"blast and bollock Blairite Britain\". He was not offered the job, but these two events were not necessarily related. </p> <p>\"Laureate's Block\" has been reprinted as the title poem of Harrison's new volume. Also included are an earlier poem he wrote fantasising the abdication of King Charles III, some poems about Bosnia, a couple more on his adultery, a suite of poems for his sick son and another to a friend who died. There are also occasional poems for birthdays and suchlike. </p> <p>There is much to dislike in the volume, but the worst thing about it is that the verse is bad. Harrison has been lauded so often for his technical skill, his facility with metre as a classicist and his ability to use the demotic alongside the elevated, that fewer and fewer people notice how cloth-eared he has become. </p> <p>Within six lines of the book's opening we encounter the couplet: \"and hymn the crown's demise I will / with this black goose-feather quill\". Leaving aside the archaic sentence construction, dictated by rhyme and metre, there is no way of scanning the second line in a satisfactory manner. </p> <p>Now, metrical variation - exchanging an iamb for a trochee, for instance, or allowing in the odd dactyl - is a legitimate and necessary technique in verse: it breaks the monotony of line upon line of iambics and, at its best, the varied metre will in some way echo a change of pace, tone, direction or content in the line.</p> <p>There is no evidence in this book that Harrison's divergence from his predominant iambic, nor his addition or subtraction of a foot every so often, is deliberate in this way; it looks, instead, very much like a bad accident. \"His restlessness fed into mine / though I've always come back to the Tyne\". There are countless examples of this: blandly worded banalities that don't quite scan. After a while, they become unintentionally hilarious. Even Homer nods, but this is more like narcolepsy. </p> <p>The most grotesque result of this poor technique is to render bathetic his more serious material: about Bosnia, for instance, or the illness of dying friends and acquaintances. One problem is that Harrison cannot see beyond the rhyming couplet to what he is trying to say. The couplet becomes an end in itself, and content is repeated for as long as Harrison can find rhymes and enough padding to fill the lines. \"Figs on the Tyne\", a birthday poem for his girlfriend, takes as its point of departure the idea that global warming has allowed Harrison to grow figs in Newcastle. </p> <p>The point is made over and over again, in a style not dissimilar to Marvell's in \"To His Coy Mistress\", a poem that gets a couple of name-checks earlier in the book. But where Marvell's apparent repetition of one point in a variety of phrases is a device aimed at steadily accumulating spurious arguments as to why his loved one should yield to him (\"the grave's a fine and private place, / but none, I think, do there embrace\"), Harrison's look threadbare rather than wittily epigrammatic: \"This vision of Yorkshire by the Med / no doubt won't come until I'm dead. / Torridity in Tyne and Wear / won't come till I'm no longer here.\" And so on, and on, and on. </p> <p>In \"Deathwatch Danceathon\" Harrison more obviously travesties Marvell's poem: \"Put less ornately, 'we're soon dead, / my sweetest darling, come to bed!' \" This might well be the problem: Harrison doesn't seem to understand why poems are written in certain ways - that the ornateness is central to the wit of Marvell's poem, for instance. </p> <p>In this collection, Harrison's no-nonsense debunking of the classics and his now tiresome employment of once-rude words is not far off the spraying of obscenities on forebears' gravestones that he treated with more sophistication in his controversial long poem V. Harrison was wrongly criticised for his use of obscenities in that book: they were crucial to his subject, and to the language of the text. Here one gets the uneasy feeling that Harrison's relish for the word \"fuck\" is that of the schoolboy rather than of the poet. </p> <p>The intimations of mortality that give Marvell's poem its grim vigour are clearly preying on Harrison. \"Laureate's Block\", in considering the death of Ted Hughes, offers the confession that \"I heard / Ted died, and needed my lover... to help me not to brood I'm near Ted's age\". </p> <p>\"Figs on the Tyne\" returns to that consolation: \"and with the first of my Tyne figs / celebrate you're 46!\"; \"I've seen it, like our love, survive / from when you were only 35\"; \"And now today you're 46 / and far from the first of our sweet figs\"; \"46 / leaves life enough for future figs, / and I still hope to suck a few / though this year I turn 62!\" </p> <p>This is a stab in the dark, but I think what Tony Harrison is saying is that his girlfriend is 46 (or forty-sigs, perhaps), and that he is 62, and that they've been dating for about a decade. I think this cheers him up, whatever his wife might make of it (\"My semen in your body's not yet dried. / My wife sleeps warm and naked by my side\"). But I do not feel that reading about any of this has improved my life. </p> <p>To be honest, this book reads like a cruel parody of Tony Harrison, and marks a terrible falling off from his earlier work. The man who wrote the admirable poem \"On Not Being Milton\" has come up with work that should be filed under \"On Not Being Marvell\" or, indeed, \"On Not Being Motion\". On the evidence of this collection, it isn't just his politics that would have made Harrison unsuitable for the Laureateship.</p>",

The three authors, writing under pen-names - \"Jackie George\" (a woman soldier, now a freelance bodyguard), \"James Rennie\" (an infantry officer, now a stockbroker), and \"Sarah Ford\" (a woman sailor, now also a freelance bodyguard), cover the years 1983-91. All publish identically-worded health warnings at the front, a mantra apparently prescribed by Whitehall: \"Owing to the sensitivity of the contents of this book, the manuscript was submitted to the ministry of defence prior to publication.

For example, the names and places changed include that of an SAS soldier, Al Slater, shot dead by the IRA in Fermanagh in December 1984. Why now conceal Slater's identity when it has been in the public domain - including two of my own books - for most of the preceding six years? Why cut out any reference to the deaths of two IRA men, Tony MacBride and Keiran Fleming, in the same contact? It would seem that the censor does not know what has been published already and what has not. </p> <p>Yet from such ignorance is asserted the right to suppress information which, since it does not damage security, the public has a right to know. </p> <p>Jackie George's book shares common features with the other two, including an account of the brutalising nature of the selection process. \"Resistance-to- interrogation\" licenses the selectors to deprive their masked, female subjects of the right to go to the loo. If they have the \"bottle\" to wet themselves before the prurient gaze of their male interrogators, that wins brownie points. </p> <p> Both of the women authors, as it happens, came from dysfunctional working-class homes where violence had already marked them. Service with Britain's secret army in the war against terrorism left them psychologically more damaged than before. No help was offered to stabilise them after the trauma of blood, booze and brutality across the water. </p> <p>Where Jackie George breaks the mould is in her attitude to the Royal Ulster Constabulary. (Ford, by contrast, decorated her bleak quarters with a King Billy tea-towel.) George describes the successful surveillance of a loyalist arms transfer, an operation which greatly displeased the RUC special branch. Her partner, Joe, \"thought we had all done a good job in locating these terrorists, regardless of their political persuasion. However, it seemed that the RUC was only concerned with apprehending republican terrorists. We were told in no uncertain terms that we were never to work that area again.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Mrs Slocombe's Pussy: Growing Up in Front of the Telly</strong><br>Stuart Jeffries <br>Flamingo, \u00a312.99, 378pp<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502336312,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Mrs Slocombe, the hyper-refined, sex-starved and elaborately coiffed matron of Grace Brothers department store in the 70s sitcom Are You Being Served?, had a running joke about her troublesome pussy. Every week she referred to her pet's difficulties, while the audience enjoyed the double-entendre, reinforced, Stuart Jeffries suggests, by the one in her name. For Jeffries, Grace Brothers was a cruelly funny metaphor for Britain's declining service economy, a self-mocking description of a country in which people hated serving others. </p> <p>But there's no irony in the subtitle of his apologia for TV. The British term \"telly\", as opposed to the American \"box\", is anthropomorphically affectionate, domesticised and coy. Calling television \"telly\" makes it quasi-familial (the BBC as \"Auntie\"). Indeed, for Jeffries, memories and emotions about television are connected to the weekly lunch with his nan: telly is almost someone (rather than something) that has given him his sense of being British. </p> <p>Thus, while Jeffries deplores the nostalgia industry of Dad's Army and detests Brideshead Revisited, he seems unaware of how much he belongs to it. His nostalgia, however, is not for the Blitz or the dreaming spires, but for the good old days when we all sat around watching Coronation Street. Only in his 30s, Jeffries already looks back to his youth as an era in which television reflected the cherished \"guilt and shame, denial and occasional bombast, fiercely guarded privacy and social awkwardness\" of British identity.

      "bodyText": "Mrs Slocombe's Pussy: Growing Up in Front of the Telly Stuart Jeffries Flamingo, \u00a312.99, 378pp Buy it at BOL Mrs Slocombe, the hyper-refined, sex-starved and elaborately coiffed matron of Grace Brothers department store in the 70s sitcom Are You Being Served?, had a running joke about her troublesome pussy. Every week she referred to her pet's difficulties, while the audience enjoyed the double-entendre, reinforced, Stuart Jeffries suggests, by the one in her name. For Jeffries, Grace Brothers was a cruelly funny metaphor for Britain's declining service economy, a self-mocking description of a country in which people hated serving others. But there's no irony in the subtitle of his apologia for TV. The British term \"telly\", as opposed to the American \"box\", is anthropomorphically affectionate, domesticised and coy. Calling television \"telly\" makes it quasi-familial (the BBC as \"Auntie\"). Indeed, for Jeffries, memories and emotions about television are connected to the weekly lunch with his nan: telly is almost someone (rather than something) that has given him his sense of being British. Thus, while Jeffries deplores the nostalgia industry of Dad's Army and detests Brideshead Revisited, he seems unaware of how much he belongs to it. His nostalgia, however, is not for the Blitz or the dreaming spires, but for the good old days when we all sat around watching Coronation Street. Only in his 30s, Jeffries already looks back to his youth as an era in which television reflected the cherished \"guilt and shame, denial and occasional bombast, fiercely guarded privacy and social awkwardness\" of British identity. However comic his descriptions of dire sitcoms, cheesy soap operas, The Eurovision Song Contest or Mastermind, Jeffries is serious in his elegy for the passing of British TV as the \"chief cultural national unifier\". The book is organised in a rough chronology, beginning with children's programmes and connecting key phases of Jeffries's growing up with memories of TV culture. He is brilliant on the childhood fantasies generated by Sooty and other hand puppets - who seemed to him frightening aliens - and on the upsetting hidings of Bill and Ben the Flowerpot Men, which he compares to the Fort-Da game of Freudian child psychology. As he gets older, Jeffries's love-hate relationship with the telly becomes more acute. He wants to see his own Birmingham suburban childhood reflected on the screen, but when he does - in Crossroads, or Brookside - he hates the lack of glamour. He admires British comedy, especially Fawlty Towers, but also sees it as conservative, self-hating and on the side of the loser. He feels a thrill of patriotism watching football, but at a real match is disgusted by his yobbish companions: \"National football for me has always had to be a television event because I can't bear to share a stadium with my compatriots.\" Indeed, he believes, the \"English national character in the late 20th century could only be defined through absurdity and negativity\". With this state of mind, Jeffries is both attracted and enraged by the confidence, prosperity and braggadocio of American television as it begins to infiltrate his family, beginning with the children's cartoon Top Cat and ending with his favourite, The Simpsons. Homer Simpson is both an eternal child and a subversive rebel - indeed, almost British.

      "body": "<p>On-line and telephone share traders are hastily taking on staff and adding new computers after the recent trading boom caught them off guard - and left furious small investors hanging on the phone for up to an hour to place, buy or sell orders. </p> <p>Since last November the number of trades on the London Stock Exchange has ballooned from around 50,000 a day to an average of 100,000 and on some days it has hit 140,000. Almost every one of the new share traders - whose cheap dealing fees have fuelled the boom - buckled under the phenomenal rise. </p> <p>Many internet dealing sys tems slowed to a crawl, which was a disaster for \"day trading\" investors in hi-tech stocks such as Pacific Media or Baltimore Technologies, where prices have yo-yoed dramatically in the space of a few hours. Many small investors abandoned internet trading sites for telephone services instead, hoping for a faster response, but found that they were held in call queues lasting 30-60 minutes. </p> <p>Anger among investors has spilled over into the chat rooms and bulletin boards at net sites such as iii and hemscott. At times the boards have been jammed with investors messaging each other with complaints about which internet or phone dealer is currently worst. All the big stockbroking names have suffered, with Charles Schwab and Barclays Stockbrokers in particular taking a roasting. </p> <p>The problems are still not fully ironed out. The Financial Services Authority stepped in before Christmas to monitor the situation and this week said service was improving, with 75-80% of calls now being answered first time.

      "bodyText": "On-line and telephone share traders are hastily taking on staff and adding new computers after the recent trading boom caught them off guard - and left furious small investors hanging on the phone for up to an hour to place, buy or sell orders. Since last November the number of trades on the London Stock Exchange has ballooned from around 50,000 a day to an average of 100,000 and on some days it has hit 140,000. Almost every one of the new share traders - whose cheap dealing fees have fuelled the boom - buckled under the phenomenal rise. Many internet dealing sys tems slowed to a crawl, which was a disaster for \"day trading\" investors in hi-tech stocks such as Pacific Media or Baltimore Technologies, where prices have yo-yoed dramatically in the space of a few hours. Many small investors abandoned internet trading sites for telephone services instead, hoping for a faster response, but found that they were held in call queues lasting 30-60 minutes. Anger among investors has spilled over into the chat rooms and bulletin boards at net sites such as iii and hemscott. At times the boards have been jammed with investors messaging each other with complaints about which internet or phone dealer is currently worst. All the big stockbroking names have suffered, with Charles Schwab and Barclays Stockbrokers in particular taking a roasting. The problems are still not fully ironed out. The Financial Services Authority stepped in before Christmas to monitor the situation and this week said service was improving, with 75-80% of calls now being answered first time. Yet a check by Jobs &amp; Money this week found that many brokers are coping only by closing their doors to new customers and, even for existing customers, severe problems can still arise on Monday mornings and Friday afternoons when trading volumes are at their most intense. Callers to Halifax's Share Xpress service are greeted by a message that the company will not accept new registrations.

The evidence is too large to ignore. Blanket denials by Russian authorities are not credible.\"</p> <p>The US state department accused Moscow of \"the indis criminate use of force\" in Chechnya in a report published yesterday. It said air and artillery attacks on civilian areas suggested that \"government forces are relying mainly on unguided rockets and other low precision weapons\".</p> <p>However, the state department report made no mention of war crimes, saying only that Moscow's human rights record \"remained uneven\".</p> <p>Mr Bouckaert said that to the best of HRW's knowledge, no US official had travelled to the region since the fighting started last year.

During a visit to Moscow on Wednesday Mr Cook expressed \"frank concern\" about the Russian campaign in Chechnya but praised the acting president Vladimir Putin's \"refreshing and open\" style. \"I found his priorities ones we would share,\" Mr Cook said. Mr Bouckaert told the Guardian yesterday that the foreign secretary was an \"emperor with no clothes\". \"During Kosovo, Mr Cook said Europe could not stand by and watch atrocities being committed or it would be com plicit. But that is exactly what he is doing with Chechnya.\" A German television report this week showed Russian soldiers dumping dozens of male corpses into a mass grave. Some of the bodies were in military uniform, but others were in civilian clothes and a number appeared to had been bound and mutilated. One of the corpses had an ear chopped off. In other footage, a lorry was shown dragging a body behind it. The German report did not make it clear when or where the film was made, and a Russian spokesman, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said last night he had information proving it was a \"fabrication\". But the European Union's foreign policy commissioner, Javier Solana, yesterday urged an independent investigation into the reports, after seeing the German film. Representatives of the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe also said they were deeply concerned about reports of human rights violations. Russian forces have prevented human rights groups from visiting Chechnya, but Mr Bouckaert said yesterday: \"The evidence of mass graves, massacres and other abuses has been emerging at an alarming rate. The evidence is too large to ignore. Blanket denials by Russian authorities are not credible.\" The US state department accused Moscow of \"the indis criminate use of force\" in Chechnya in a report published yesterday. It said air and artillery attacks on civilian areas suggested that \"government forces are relying mainly on unguided rockets and other low precision weapons\". However, the state department report made no mention of war crimes, saying only that Moscow's human rights record \"remained uneven\". Mr Bouckaert said that to the best of HRW's knowledge, no US official had travelled to the region since the fighting started last year. Monitors from the OSCE have been prevented from visiting Chechnya or neighbouring Ingushetia, a constraint he said the OSCE and its member states had \"meekly accepted\". The west's response to the tragedy had been \"all talk and no action\". In a column in yesterday's Washington Post he wrote: \"In the wake of the noble principles announced during the Kosovo and East Timor crises, the silence on Chechnya is deafening.\"",

Mr Babitsky, a fearless reporter who enraged the Russian authorities with his detailed dispatches on civilian suffering in war-ravaged Chechnya, spoke to his wife, Lyudmila, yesterday by telephone for the first time since his disappearance last month. He had been shown last month, on film shot by Russian intelligence, being swapped to alleged Chechen guerrillas in exchange for two captured Russian soldiers in Chechnya. Amid a series of contradictory statements from Russian officials on the journalist's fate, his family, friends, and employers - the US government-funded Radio Liberty - feared he had been killed. His disappearance was taken in Moscow and abroad as a harbinger of the type of administration being groomed by Vladimir Putin, Russia's acting president and a former intelligence chief. The circumstances of Mr Babitsky's re-emergence were unclear last night. Ms Babitsky had travelled to Prague, Radio Liberty's headquarters, yesterday where she received a phone call from her husband from Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan to the east of Chechnya. \"He told me he was at the interior ministry press centre in Makhachkala. I don't know if anyone brought him there,\" she told Russian television last night. \"The conversation was very brief.

The attempt by some councils, such as Westminster and Slough, to solve their asylum problems by bussing refugees across the country has sparked protests from the receiving authorities. The northern authorities, including Newcastle and Hull, are faced with providing essential services to the asylum seekers without any warning. The official caution was sent out as the latest home office figures showed that the number of new asylum applications had fallen from 7,180 in December to 6,110 in January. The number of decisions leapt from 2, 320 in December to 4,040 in January, but despite this improvement the backlog of cases continued to grow, reaching a new record of 104,890. The recovery in the system for making decisions was welcomed by refugee welfare groups but it is still a long way from delivering an average of 8,000 decisions each month promised by the spring by Tony Blair in the Commons last week. The extent to which the Conservative party intends to use the issue of asylum in this May's local government elections became clear yesterday. Two Conservative-led local authorities, Kent county council and the London borough of Hillingdon, said that their voters would face council tax increases in order to pay for the costs of supporting increased numbers of asylum seekers waiting for decisions. Kent county council claimed that the department of health's failure to reimburse the full costs of looking after unaccompanied refugee children would add about \u00a33 extra to household council tax bills. Unlike adult asylum seekers, children who arrive in Britain on their own and claim asylum cannot be sent to other parts of the country. Some of the money in dispute between Whitehall and Kent is to pay for places in private foster care to supplement council care. London councils believe there is a \u00a310m shortfall between the cost of providing services to the 55,000 asylum seekers living in the capital and the funds being made available by Whitehall. The Local Government Association yesterday warned councils in the south-east against bussing asylum seekers to private landlords in the north without warning the local council in the area. John Ransford, the association's head of social affairs, said: \"These private arrangements are against Local Government Association guidelines and should not be required now that we have the organised dispersal scheme which can deal with the situation in a properly co-ordinated way.\" But the current scheme for shifting the burden away from London and the south-east has seen only about 4,000 places offered in the north and the midlands instead of the 40,000 needed.

The main difference, he said with breathtaking cheek, was that he was \"arguably\" less extreme than Blair on the issue of immigration.

One difficulty with this slippery fellow is that he hasn't actually said a lot to pin him down as a neo-Nazi, and what little he has said he has subsequently explained away.

It is a one-man show.

      "bodyText": "I should begin by addressing an error in a report of Thursday's London mayoral debate. I was sitting in the audience, minding my own business, when Ken Livingstone came in and sat in front of me. Hence, I was reported in this paper as being part of his \"entourage\". This suggests I'm the sort of person who follows people around. Moreover, if we are defined by the person sitting in front, we could be accused of anything. It might be said that I am part of a taxi-driver's coterie, the inner circle of friends and hangers-on who broadly share his views on other drivers and immigration. What if I were sitting in the Streatham Odeon and J\u00f6rg Haider breezed in? I would at least move seats, if not lead the audience in a rousing chorus of Edelweiss. But what if I were slow to act, and a photographer caught me? It might be reported that I'm a member of the Countryside Alliance. This is all by the by. You probably want to know what were the least boring and depressing moments of the debate, and might have guessed that they were the bits when Frank Dobson wasn't speaking. His speech consisted of: \"I want to live in a London where. . .\" and you can fill in the rest. The Liberal, Susan Kramer, was nice, but kept saying: \"I'm a banker,\" as though it were a good thing. I'm glad there are kindly sorts working in finance but I could never lay down my life for the kind of person who says: \"You should really be making your money work for you.\" Annoyingly, the best speaker was Steven Norris, who might have stormed the gig were it not for the fact that his body language is all to cock.

      "body": "<p>This week Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Sky 1) was about cultural imperialism. It was Thanksgiving and Buffy, though properly conflicted about celebrating a frankly white triumphalist historical moment, wanted a nice turkey dinner to remind herself of her lost youth. Willow (the dopey, cutesy one who during this episode was wearing a sweater with a CND logo as if to underscore her radical credentials) felt differently. She didn't want to kill the native American avenging spirit who had risen from the dead at this topical time to slash the throats of white America, but preferred to return his people's land to this solitary remnant of a once-great tribe and generally be nice and gooily guilt-ridden. Bleeding-heart liberals! God save us from them! This, one suspects, isn't the way to win the hearts of Guardian readers. </p> <p>But back to the story. A long-dead native American, with a full set of brooding brows, chiselled jaw and sensual lips, had come back to life to avenge the extermination of his tribe. He slashed the throat of the cultural centre's curator and then smashed into its display cases in order steal their contents - a clutch of rather unpleasant-looking tomahawks with which he intended to express himself freely. Mind where you're waving those sharp items, sunshine. </p> <p>He tried to get forbiddingly butch on Buffy's nocturnal booty. \"I am vengeance,\" he told her as he dodged a flying kick. \"My people have called on Hoos, their avenging spirit, to carve out justice.\" Avenging spirits who talk about themselves in the third person and have little in the way of a sense of humour can become tiresome, don't you find? </p> <p>Intriguingly, there was another level to this cultural analysis. Giles, Buffy's bookish English sidekick, brought the whiff of the British empire to southern California. As Buffy prepared Thanksgiving dinner, she complained that the peas were frozen and so would be mushy. \"But I like mushy peas,\" said Giles, alluding to his country's rich, erm, culinary heritage. That, replied Buffy, is probably why the first pilgrims left Plymouth for the new world. In search of a new life of fresh peas. Probably, though, their motivation was rather more complex. </p> <p>Spike, the English vampire with a bleach-blond hairdo, contested Willow's view that one should talk to this avenging spirit and perhaps smoke a pipe of peace with him. He did so in an accent that veered uneasily from Ruislip to Redondo Beach (Americans, those reverse cultural imperialists, never do their old oppressors the favour of getting details about Britain or anywhere east of Maine right. Insular clowns.) </p> <p>\"You exterminated his race,\" Spike told Willow. \"What could you possibly say to him that would make him feel better? It's kill or be killed here. Take your bloody pick.\" They read a lot of Nietzsche down Ruislip way these days, you know. </p> <p>Unfortunately for this subversive text, Buffy ended with a mass brawl in which a lot of anonymous native American avenging spirits were bumped off by the slayer and her all-white chums, in the manner of an old western. Which kind of served to deconstruct the show's radical critique. Bummer. </p> <p>Talking of reverse cultural imperialism (we were, you know), in the first show of the third series of Goodness Gracious Me (BBC2), the NDPD were on the hunt for a murderer. The NDPD are like the New York Police Department except that they are, in a very real sense, responsible for law enforcement in Delhi. Now perhaps you understand what I'm on about. </p> <p>The deceased was a member of the \"English community\". \"But let's not forget,\" said the captain to hoots of derision from his Indian officers, \"we are supposed to police the whole community. Not just the Indians, but the white minority, too.\" This was a very funny critique of racist policing, of the kind for which the Metropolitan Police has been repeatedly criticised. Goodness Gracious Me is at its best with such reverse racist sketches. </p> <p>The murder victim had been found in a gutter with a 12in knife in his back and a note that read: \"Die whitey scum.\" The token white police officer suggested that this, just possibly, might have been a racially motivated killing. The Indian officers rolled their eyes sarcastically. That's the trouble with these white English people. Touchy buggers. Always thinking that everything comes down to race.

Beckham is obviously not a thug, like so many of his colleagues, but he is horribly Peter Pannish in his petulance. The one thing sportsmen always had over the rest of us was the myth of their self- discipline; they hadn't read Huysmans and they thought Verdi was a type of pasta, but goddamn they could control themselves!

But if feminism did not exist, then extreme capitalism would surely have had to invent it, because it is feminism that currently does scapegoat duty for all the social evils that the free market has inflicted upon us. Unemployment, the underclass, the unmarried mother who has nothing to gain from marrying a ManBoy on the dole - capitalism did all this, but feminism carries the can.

As if this was not bitter harvest enough, there is also the fact that while the all-pervasiveness of the free market frees up the rich to live in a permanent Never-Never Land, the same market contributes to the fact that some citizens have no childhoods whatsoever.

If these progressive forces had only been united, runs the argument, then we might not have had to live through seven decades of Conservative or Conservative-dominated rule. Thanks to that division, Labour has governed for no more than 24 of the last 100 years. Tony Blair himself is an advocate of this view of history: indeed, it forms the rationale behind his beloved \"project\" of ever-closer cooperation with the Liberal Democrats. Mr Blair urges a reunion of the liberal left, to ensure that if the 20th century belonged to the Conservatives, then the 21st ought to be in the hands of the progressives.</p> <p>There is some appeal in this argument, not least the compelling evidence of the numbers. Still, despite our century-long advocacy of accommodation between the Labour and Liberal parties, we cannot agree with it completely. Lest we forget, it was Labour which built the modern welfare state - including a national health service and pensions system - oversaw the peaceful end of the British empire, constructed the open university and presided over a decade of social progress, with liberalising legislation in the 1960s on abortion, sexuality, the death penalty and equal pay. No party with a proud record like that should be asked to regard its own existence as a mistake. On the contrary, if the brute reality of our first past the post electoral system means there was only room for one progressive party, it would surely have been the Liberals who had to leave the stage - not Labour. Liberals cannot, with any conviction, claim they would have notched up that same catalogue of achievement. It took the Labour party.</p> <p>A tougher argument is the one about the present and future. The party of Tony Blair faces problems that would have baffled its predecessors. For one thing, devolution has moulded an unfamiliar landscape. There are now at least three distinct political battlefields in Britain: Scotland, Wales and the UK-wide parliament in Westminster. Labour is the only party which is a lead player on all three grounds - taking on the nationalists on the first two, and the Conservatives on the third. Labour's dominance in all these different arenas leaves a problem: how can a party tailor different messages for these increasingly distinct political entities yet still remain a single, coherent UK-wide party? Can Labour continue to speak a language that appeals to Edinburgh and Cardiff while simultaneously reaching the voters of middle England, the people who decide general elections at Westminster? Can it have one transport policy for the country and another for London, if that's what it takes to win a London-wide election? This is an existential challenge to Labour far more than to the Conservatives - who have all but given up on being a UK-wide party. It is Labour which needs to crack this riddle.</p> <p>The party's second problem is related. Labour's great modern achievement is to have transcended its original status as a sectional vehicle for one class. The Blairite Labour party is a home fit for millionaires and business leaders now; no longer the ragged-trousered comrades who gathered on Farringdon Street. This counts, in part, as a testament to Labour's own achievement: its expansion of higher education led to the creation of a vast, new middle class and the eventual blurring of the old class hierarchies. But it also leaves Labour with a conundrum. How can Labour be the party of David Sainsbury and Bob Ayling - and simultaneously keep hold of its loyalists in the heartlands, the men and women typified by the former minister, Peter Kilfoyle, who resigned over what he regards as the excessive attention lavished on affluent middle England? The prime minister says he's \"not interested\" in the tired old language of class. But that is too easy. Labour needs to find a way to stay true to its roots, even as it stretches and grows, touching areas that were once deemed out of reach. These concerns need not be sources of angst. On the contrary, they are problems that come from success, rather than failure. After 100 years there is much to celebrate. Labour can wish itself a very happy birthday.</p>",

Labour needs to find a way to stay true to its roots, even as it stretches and grows, touching areas that were once deemed out of reach. These concerns need not be sources of angst. On the contrary, they are problems that come from success, rather than failure. After 100 years there is much to celebrate. Labour can wish itself a very happy birthday.",

      "bodyText": "Nato rushed to calm fears about Kosovo last night, pledging to keep its forces up to strength, but claiming that the immediate crisis in the ethnically divided town of Mitrovice was now over. Speaking after an emergency meeting of the north Atlantic council, the alliance's governing body, the Nato secretary general, Lord Robertson, insisted that the situation was under control. \"Mitrovice is a potential flashpoint. It flared up but we dealt with the unrest quickly and decisively,\" he told reporters in Brussels. \"K-For has dealt with the situation firmly and even-handedly. \"We are determined to keep K-For at the right strength to allow it to carry out all its security tasks in Kosovo.\" Reinforcements could be announced next week, after Britain, Italy and Spain reportedly expressed willingness to provide more peacekeeping troops for the troubled Serbian province. France has already offered to send another 600-700 men. Officials at Nato headquarters said another option was to deploy forces from outside the 37,000 under K-For command but which are being held in a \"strategic reserve\" in the region. There was an attempt to play down the dimensions of the crisis, which has erupted uncomfortably close to next month's first anniversary of Nato's war against Yugoslavia. But troubling questions about ambiguous policies and inadequate means remain. \"It was never a question of going round the table and pointing a finger and saying 'you're not doing the job',\" one senior diplomat said last night. \"This wasn't about numbers and who was going to cough up.\" Concern has focused on the fact that some K-For participants have allowed their contributions to slip - limiting the ability of commanders to redeploy quickly within Kosovo. Others, privately accused of not pulling their weight, have not been willing to have their troops deployed away from their agreed command areas, in trouble spots like Mitrovice. General Wesley Clark, Nato's supreme commander in Europe, appeared before the council for the second time this week while Gen Klaus Reinhardt of Germany, the K-For commander, addressed ambassadors by video link from Pristina. Gen Clark has formally requested three new battalions - 1,800 to 2,000 troops. No decision was made on Gen Clark's request, but the alliance's military committee was ordered to examine troop needs and report back to the council next week. The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, under pressure because resources are already stretched, said that Britain - the largest contributor to K-For - would see what others had to offer. Tensions have been high in Mitrovice since a grenade attack on a United Nations bus in early February killed two elderly Serbs. Revenge attacks followed, leading K-For troops to carry out extensive searches to seize weapons. Nato claims that the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, is orchestrating a destabilisation campaign in the city, which contains the most significant Serb community remaining in Kosovo, and that ethnic Albanians are also trying to foment trouble. Bernard Kouchner, the French head of the UN civilian operation in Kosovo, yesterday demanded that more police be sent to the province. \"I need a lot more policemen, a lot more. I need about 2,500 more. Even the slightest bit more would be a gift for us,\" he said in a radio interview.",

I was beginning to think I was the only person in the world who doesn't want a garden where ground that might be used for planting is covered in decking, where the walls or fences are painted bright blue, and where the planting plan is based either on bamboo or tree ferns. Pete Whittle Canterbury, Kent What an old curmudgeon Stefan Buczacki has become. Gardening in England has always been a matter of fashion: just look at Capability Brown, who swept whole landscapes away in creating new gardens. Bamboos, far from being new, were imported by Victorians, along with a host of other exotic imports that make our gardens so rich and interesting. We have always been inclined to 'plonk something alien' into our gardens. This is the English tradition. Tony Danford London SE20 Julie Burchill's public vilification of the fashion industry gave me a great sense of relief (February 19). She articulated just about everything I've ever wanted to say on the subject and thus saved me the bother. Thanks. Rob Childs Great Cransley, Northants The Knowledge (February 19) recommends Coleman's mustard, as it 'really is the one'. Taylor's is the only English mustard worthy of mention - it just tastes better. You've got me all hot under the collar now. ben@haberdasher.demon.co.uk \u0095 Guardian Weekend, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER. Email: weekend@theguardian.com. Fax: 020-7239 9935.

      "body": "<p>In Mexico I am thought of as an actor rather than a director, and in late 1998 I was offered the second lead in a movie called The Law and the Gun. This was filmed in a fake town in a forest of giant cacti about an hour from Tehuacan, a city in southern Mexico. The story concerns a humble rubbish dump operative hired by the ruling political party to fill in as temporary mayor after his predecessor has been mysteriously killed. </p> <p>The actor playing the mayor was Damian Alcazar, whom I had directed in Highway Patrolman. Damian is a brilliant actor - intuitive, intelligent - and one handsome dude. The director was Luis Estrada, known as \"el Perrito\", who had previously directed two regular films, The Long Road to Tijuana and Bandidos, and a weirder third one, Ambar. </p> <p>Luis is popular within Mexico's film community, but at the time he was viewed as a not-great director embarking on his final film. Quite early in the shoot it was apparent this was not the case. First, the script - by four writers including Luis - is good: a satire on political corruption in the 40s with modern parallels. Second, the cast, assembled by Claudia Becker, Mexico's top casting director, is one of the best I've ever seen. And third, Luis was going for broke: encouraging us to be both serious and mad. \"If the whole film is like this it will be quite insane,\" I wrote in my diary. </p> <p>At this stage I didn't know what the film was about, having only - in true coarse actor fashion - read the scenes in which my character, the villainous \"Gringo\", appeared. </p> <p>The film wrapped just before Christmas. In February 1999 I was back in Mexico playing a bent cop in another film. Luis showed me an early edit of The Law and the Gun, now called Herod's Law after a Mexican saying, \"O te chingas, o te jodes\" (politely, screw or be screwed). The film seemed long, but good, and I was delighted that all the Gringo's scenes had made it to the screen. </p> <p>Cut to last September. Luis had asked for my help in translating the screenplay into English, so I was in Mexico again. The film was tighter, and there was already a buzz about it. The word was that Herod's Law was very funny, and was about to run into serious political trouble. </p> <p>Mexican cinema has a sensitive relationship with politics. The industry receives considerable support from the government, which views film as a serious art form and cultural ambassador. Along with this support comes a certain deference and self- censorship. </p> <p>Until the late 80s, foreign films shot in Mexico had state censors on the set, and there was an unspoken prohibition against showing potent images such as the president's face or the national flag. Then, in 1989, the talented director Jorge Fons secretly made a brilliant picture called Rojo Amanecer (Red Sunrise), about the government's massacre of students on the eve of the 1968 Olympics. President Salinas de Gortari (currently a fugitive in Dublin while his drug-money-laundering brother Raul resides in Almoloya jail) tried to ban it, only to be defeated by a wave of intellectual and popular protest. Rojo Amanecer eventually received wide distribution, and was popularly viewed as having broken the back of state censorship. </p> <p>But Salinas had his revenge. His signature on the North American Free Trade Agreement unleashed a flood of American pictures into the domestic market. Simultaneously the Americans threatened to sue Mexico and Canada, claiming that state support of cinema was a restraint of trade. In just a few years, Mexican cinema was driven to the wall, unable to compete with a massive influx of gringo movies that distributors could pick up cheaply. Several Mexican directors gave up on their own country and moved to Hollywood. The success of Alfonso Arau's Like Water for Chocolate meant nothing: it was simply a \"calling card\" so that its director could join the drift to LA. </p> <p>By the end of last year, a confrontation over Herod's Law was imminent. Unlike Highway Patrolman - where we agreed not to show the actual Mexican highway patrol, but to create a fictitious one - Luis's picture pulled no punches. It named the ruling party, the PRI; showed the PRI's bloodstained colours (not coincidentally, the colours of the Mexican flag); and accused it of corruption and political assassination. In a completely credible scene, the state governor (Ernesto Gomez Cruz) instructs his assistant (the formidable Pedro Armendariz Jr) to murder a party rival who has secured the presidential nomination. The parallels with Luis Colosio and Francisco Ruiz Massieu - PRI officials killed, allegedly, on the orders of the Salinas brothers - are lost on no one. </p> <p>In December, Luis told me that he had been offered distribution by a major Mexican distributor - on condition that he delay the film's release until after the presidential election, due this July. The head of the company also owned a vast TV conglomerate and - like all Mexico's billionaires - was one of the ruling party's faithful. Could a comedy set in the 40s really unseat a power bloc that has never lost a presidential election? </p> <p>It seemed unlikely. But there was fear in the air. Luis refused to delay the film's release. A week later, Herod's Law was screened unannounced by the financier, the state film board Imcine. The screenings were not advertised. After two days the run was cancelled and the film was canned. </p> <p>In Hollywood, that would be that. Many are the films that the studios have financed, then turned against and stashed in dusty vaults. But films in Mexico aren't just about money or corporate politics. They're also about art, and the right of artists to be heard. The leading lady, the valiant Leticia Huijara, organised a campaign against Imcine's suppression of Herod's Law. The actors all sent faxes of protest to the appropriate authorities. And somehow a miracle occurred. Imcine washed its hands of the whole business, and gave Luis the negative of his film. He was to distribute it himself, if he could. If the film made money, Luis would then repay Imcine's investment. </p> <p> That seemed like a tall order. I once \"four-walled\" a film of Borges's Death and the Compass. \"Four-walling\" means you rent the cinema and pay for the prints and adverts yourself. It is a thankless, time-consuming task. You cannot possibly compete with the majors, or even the minors. There is little money to be made. </p> <p>But, for Herod's Law, a second miracle happened. I don't mean the premiere at Sundance, where it won the best Latin American picture prize (though this was good news), but the mysterious appearance of an \"angel\" who offered Luis enough money to strike 250 prints and open the picture nationwide. </p> <p>That's a lot of prints. Herod's Law opened more widely, with more fanfare and more full-page ads, than any previous Mexican film. I went to Mexico City for the opening a week ago. The media reaction (apart from those papers that ignored the film) was generally good. I accompanied Luis, Claudia and Damian to two screenings, and the public response was even better. The houses were 90% full; the audience roared with laughter at the awful goings-on, booed the gringo, and applauded at the end. </p> <p>The movie has confirmed Luis Estrada as a major directorial talent. One hopes he will not decamp to the US but continue making films in Mexico, whose cinema can only benefit from his particular brand of irony. </p> <p>But there is something strange about his big break. Normally a distributor would be anxious to publicise itself, especially if it had just embarked upon the most ambitious opening campaign in Mexican film history. Yet no name appears on the posters or in the film. The only credit is for Luis's company, Bandidos Films, whose empire consists of two rented rooms in Churubusco Studios. </p> <p>The distributor of Herod's Law is behaving with unusual modesty - keeping itself a secret, almost. But secrets are hard to keep, and there is speculation that the financial entity behind this release has a stake not only in the film but in the outcome of the July election. </p> <p>It would not be surprising if this angel were connected to one of the opposition parties. Of these, the left-wing PRD has little money, while the right-wing PAN has lots of money (some of it allegedly from the United States: the PAN's presidential candidate is the former head of Coca Cola in Mexico). </p> <p>Can a film make a political difference? Hard to say. Rojo Amanecer was certainly part of a wave of greater artistic freedom, but the PRI remained in power all the same. Even a work as brilliant as Peter Watkins's The War Game had little political impact, and was forgotten last year in the BFI's list of 100 influential British films. </p> <p>But somebody - previously an importer of American films, they say, \"trying out\" a Mexican movie for the first time - is paying for all those 35mm prints, double-page newspaper ads, TV commercials and cinema rentals. </p> <p>It would be ironic if Luis's film - which comes from a leftist, progressive viewpoint - helps bring down a reactionary, repressive government - so that a more reactionary, more repressive regime even more acceptable to the gringos can take its place. </p> <p>But isn't that Herod's Law?</p>",

Gritty blue cabinet pieces with white relief decoration become the height of fashion, and an English institution is born.</p> <p>Wedgwood retail concession, circa 1990: Sophie and Richard choose a set of Jasper vases for their wedding list; Great Aunt Ethel buys yet another Jasper figure to put in the corner cupboard. Young, fashion-conscious shoppers cut through on their way to Habitat.</p> <p>Stoke 2000. I am standing in an over-heated office at Wedgwood headquarters, looking at a collection of contemporary, functional tableware. No blue, no white mouldings, no pieces designed for display only. Just a collection of nine black-and-white items to use and enjoy. These are ceramics for the 21st century: the modern face of Jasper. Sophie, Richard and Great Aunt Ethel may need a dose of smelling salts to help them recover from the shock, but, frankly, they've had more than 200 years of Josiah's vision of Jasper, and now it's time to do something new.</p> <p>Enter Nick Munro, an industrial designer and creator of simple, modern pieces such as flat-but-round teapots and wire-spiral egg cups. His brief was to break out of classical Jasper and make it more relevant for today. There were strict rules about the number of items he could produce - and even stricter deadlines - but, other than that, he could do as he liked.</p> <p>And he did. Looking at the pieces in isolation, you don't see anything all that radical. But looking at them on the factory floor, surrounded by sets of floral tableware and traditional Jasper trinkets (they have no intention of stopping production - they go a bomb among tourists who want to buy a little bit of England), then Nick Munro's take on Jasper seems very radical indeed.</p> <p>I was hoping to hear stories of battles between blue-and-white-loving Luddites and thrusting creatives with visions of the future, but apparently not. Jill Sharrock, Wedgwood's creative director, admits to some problems in the early stages. \"In theory, persuading people in the company that Jasper needed a face-lift wasn't difficult,\" she says, \"but persuading people to take action, to take the risk, was.\" But once the project was underway, it seems everything went swimmingly. In fact, according to Munro, everyone's been happily on-message and the whole project has been a joy from beginning to end.</p> <p>If this is true, then Munro can afford some self-congratulation. He could have been a remote designer, a guy in an unstructured suit who sent new-fangled ideas down the phone lines and expected the workers to produce. But that isn't his way. He has been on site almost all the time, and the project has been conceived and created on the factory floor. \"I've never found, in all the things that I've done, that being remote from the factory is an efficient way of developing a project,\" he explains. \"Quite the opposite. It takes much longer, it's much more expensive and you don't get what you want.\"</p> <p>And he does like to get what he wants. Not that he's a bully; he has a great respect for the craftsmanship of mass-production and believes very strongly in meeting everyone involved and listening to their points of view. But when he knows something's right, then he expects to get it done. For example, one of the main problems with traditional Jasper, as he saw it, was that gritty, fingernails-down-the-blackboard texture - a real off-putter in this sensuous age. So Munro told Wedgwood to buy a few Vibro machines (chipping-filled drums that smooth out roughness by shaking violently) at a cost of about \u00a350,000 each.</p> <p>Another problem was the perceived impracticality of old- style Jasper, which, because it's rough, is thought to stain - hardly a great asset in a working teapot. So Munro decided to glaze the insides of his pieces (see photograph, p47). However, the problem with glazes is that millions of tiny particles float around in the air. If they're white, that's okay, but if black, they threaten to ruin anything in their path. But Munro was adamant and the glaze stayed. And did it cause a problem?</p> <p>\"Probably,\" he smiles. This re-launch of Jasper has been a long process (I first heard about it 18 months ago, and by then it was well underway) and has cost Wedgwood a considerable amount of money, so you can't help wondering why they didn't just ditch Jasper as a has-been and turn to something more intrinsically modern.</p> <p>The answer, of course, lies in its history. All that historical baggage may be the reason things stood still for so long, but it's also the reason that Wedgwood still has a reputation worth a costly re-launch. \"It's their icon,\" Munro explains. \"If you took that historic blue-and-white thing away, it wouldn't be any different as a company from Royal Doulton or whatever. Wedgwood invented it.\"</p> <p>Munro is keen on the history thing; keen to point out that Josiah Wedgwood was a real pioneer. \"The irony is,\" he says, \"that the tradition of the company really is all about change. That is fundamental to the success of it originally. It was a very competitive company, very commercial, very switched on with regard to marketing and PR, skilful in product development, innovative, all that.</p> <p>\"But when one looked at some of the products that are in the company's portfolio right now, that tradition was just not there. The opportunity with this project was to say, 'Well hang on, we don't have to do that, there's a big opening to do something that really is closer to the spirit of the business than some of the products which are normally thought of as defining what the company's about.\"</p> <p>So, Sophie, Richard, Aunt Ethel, and all you tourists who think you can capture England in a piece of scratchy blue china, you need to think again. If Josiah Wedgwood could see that bookend he'd turn in his grave. But this stuff, this is very Wedgwood.</p> <p>Munro has done his time in the archive, and each of the pieces (with the exception of the cat bowl, which was put in to partner the dog bowl) has historical precedence. And as for the colour? Well, it doesn't say anywhere that Jasper should be blue with white relief - in fact, the stone colour Munro has used in this collection is Jasper clay in its original, undyed state. (That no one had considered using the clay in its natural state before is truly amazing.)</p> <p>The colour of the collection is interesting and does give it the unmistakable stamp of Nick Munro - those black-and-white tea cups are straight out of his personal design studio - but while he does accept this, he also points out that changing the colour of Jasper was the obvious thing to do and, given the stone colour of the clay, black was the only choice. \"There would have to have been a very good reason for doing something else,\" he says. He also believes he has stayed true to the tradition of innovation.</p> <p>\"Technically,\" he says, \"the project has a lot of genuine merit. The vases aren't going to transform anyone's idea of what a vase should be, that wasn't the point. But as a Jasper vase, it's quite an interesting project - the spiral shape [inspired by Keith Murray's work for Wedgwood in the 30s] employed the full resources of the computer-aided design department and the mould had to be re-designed to accommodate it.\"</p> <p>Listening to Munro and the Wedgwood team list the collection's historical credentials, you realise that they feel forced to justify the legitimacy of what they are doing lest they provoke a public outcry. Classic Jasper is, after all, a British institution, and even those of us who would never dream of buying a piece can still experience feelings of nostalgia for those little cameos and ashtrays that cluttered our grandparents' homes.</p> <p>There is little doubt that this new collection is a triumph - it is everything a contemporary ceramic collection should be, with Wedgwood quality on top - but they have taken a risk. Strong sales are not a certainty. The modern young things at which the Nick Munro Jasper collection is aimed are not in the habit of thinking Wedgwood when they shop for tableware. Preconceptions formed over generations are not changed overnight. And what about that traditional market of county couples and maiden aunts? What will they make of relief- mould-free black-and-white Jasper? Has Wedgwood regained its past only to ruin its future?</p> <p>Jill Sharrock thinks not. \"New directions are risky,\" she says, \"but what Nick has produced is so simple in its modernity that I believe it is a modern classic. I do not believe the range is contrived or difficult, but handles sculptural, functional form in a way that good design transcends time. Context will make the product modern or traditional.\"</p> <p>And clever marketing will make it a success or failure</p> <p>\u0095 The Nick Munro Jasper Collection for Wedgwood goes on sale in mid-March.

      "bodyText": "Stoke, circa 1775: Josiah Wedgwood invents Jasper clay, marking the first key innovation in ceramic composition since the Chinese discovered porcelain some 1,000 years before. Gritty blue cabinet pieces with white relief decoration become the height of fashion, and an English institution is born. Wedgwood retail concession, circa 1990: Sophie and Richard choose a set of Jasper vases for their wedding list; Great Aunt Ethel buys yet another Jasper figure to put in the corner cupboard. Young, fashion-conscious shoppers cut through on their way to Habitat. Stoke 2000. I am standing in an over-heated office at Wedgwood headquarters, looking at a collection of contemporary, functional tableware. No blue, no white mouldings, no pieces designed for display only. Just a collection of nine black-and-white items to use and enjoy. These are ceramics for the 21st century: the modern face of Jasper. Sophie, Richard and Great Aunt Ethel may need a dose of smelling salts to help them recover from the shock, but, frankly, they've had more than 200 years of Josiah's vision of Jasper, and now it's time to do something new. Enter Nick Munro, an industrial designer and creator of simple, modern pieces such as flat-but-round teapots and wire-spiral egg cups. His brief was to break out of classical Jasper and make it more relevant for today. There were strict rules about the number of items he could produce - and even stricter deadlines - but, other than that, he could do as he liked. And he did. Looking at the pieces in isolation, you don't see anything all that radical. But looking at them on the factory floor, surrounded by sets of floral tableware and traditional Jasper trinkets (they have no intention of stopping production - they go a bomb among tourists who want to buy a little bit of England), then Nick Munro's take on Jasper seems very radical indeed. I was hoping to hear stories of battles between blue-and-white-loving Luddites and thrusting creatives with visions of the future, but apparently not. Jill Sharrock, Wedgwood's creative director, admits to some problems in the early stages. \"In theory, persuading people in the company that Jasper needed a face-lift wasn't difficult,\" she says, \"but persuading people to take action, to take the risk, was.\" But once the project was underway, it seems everything went swimmingly. In fact, according to Munro, everyone's been happily on-message and the whole project has been a joy from beginning to end. If this is true, then Munro can afford some self-congratulation. He could have been a remote designer, a guy in an unstructured suit who sent new-fangled ideas down the phone lines and expected the workers to produce. But that isn't his way. He has been on site almost all the time, and the project has been conceived and created on the factory floor. \"I've never found, in all the things that I've done, that being remote from the factory is an efficient way of developing a project,\" he explains. \"Quite the opposite. It takes much longer, it's much more expensive and you don't get what you want.\" And he does like to get what he wants. Not that he's a bully; he has a great respect for the craftsmanship of mass-production and believes very strongly in meeting everyone involved and listening to their points of view. But when he knows something's right, then he expects to get it done. For example, one of the main problems with traditional Jasper, as he saw it, was that gritty, fingernails-down-the-blackboard texture - a real off-putter in this sensuous age. So Munro told Wedgwood to buy a few Vibro machines (chipping-filled drums that smooth out roughness by shaking violently) at a cost of about \u00a350,000 each. Another problem was the perceived impracticality of old- style Jasper, which, because it's rough, is thought to stain - hardly a great asset in a working teapot. So Munro decided to glaze the insides of his pieces (see photograph, p47). However, the problem with glazes is that millions of tiny particles float around in the air. If they're white, that's okay, but if black, they threaten to ruin anything in their path. But Munro was adamant and the glaze stayed. And did it cause a problem? \"Probably,\" he smiles. This re-launch of Jasper has been a long process (I first heard about it 18 months ago, and by then it was well underway) and has cost Wedgwood a considerable amount of money, so you can't help wondering why they didn't just ditch Jasper as a has-been and turn to something more intrinsically modern. The answer, of course, lies in its history. All that historical baggage may be the reason things stood still for so long, but it's also the reason that Wedgwood still has a reputation worth a costly re-launch. \"It's their icon,\" Munro explains. \"If you took that historic blue-and-white thing away, it wouldn't be any different as a company from Royal Doulton or whatever. Wedgwood invented it.\" Munro is keen on the history thing; keen to point out that Josiah Wedgwood was a real pioneer. \"The irony is,\" he says, \"that the tradition of the company really is all about change. That is fundamental to the success of it originally. It was a very competitive company, very commercial, very switched on with regard to marketing and PR, skilful in product development, innovative, all that. \"But when one looked at some of the products that are in the company's portfolio right now, that tradition was just not there. The opportunity with this project was to say, 'Well hang on, we don't have to do that, there's a big opening to do something that really is closer to the spirit of the business than some of the products which are normally thought of as defining what the company's about.\" So, Sophie, Richard, Aunt Ethel, and all you tourists who think you can capture England in a piece of scratchy blue china, you need to think again. If Josiah Wedgwood could see that bookend he'd turn in his grave. But this stuff, this is very Wedgwood. Munro has done his time in the archive, and each of the pieces (with the exception of the cat bowl, which was put in to partner the dog bowl) has historical precedence. And as for the colour? Well, it doesn't say anywhere that Jasper should be blue with white relief - in fact, the stone colour Munro has used in this collection is Jasper clay in its original, undyed state. (That no one had considered using the clay in its natural state before is truly amazing.) The colour of the collection is interesting and does give it the unmistakable stamp of Nick Munro - those black-and-white tea cups are straight out of his personal design studio - but while he does accept this, he also points out that changing the colour of Jasper was the obvious thing to do and, given the stone colour of the clay, black was the only choice. \"There would have to have been a very good reason for doing something else,\" he says. He also believes he has stayed true to the tradition of innovation. \"Technically,\" he says, \"the project has a lot of genuine merit. The vases aren't going to transform anyone's idea of what a vase should be, that wasn't the point. But as a Jasper vase, it's quite an interesting project - the spiral shape [inspired by Keith Murray's work for Wedgwood in the 30s] employed the full resources of the computer-aided design department and the mould had to be re-designed to accommodate it.\" Listening to Munro and the Wedgwood team list the collection's historical credentials, you realise that they feel forced to justify the legitimacy of what they are doing lest they provoke a public outcry. Classic Jasper is, after all, a British institution, and even those of us who would never dream of buying a piece can still experience feelings of nostalgia for those little cameos and ashtrays that cluttered our grandparents' homes. There is little doubt that this new collection is a triumph - it is everything a contemporary ceramic collection should be, with Wedgwood quality on top - but they have taken a risk. Strong sales are not a certainty. The modern young things at which the Nick Munro Jasper collection is aimed are not in the habit of thinking Wedgwood when they shop for tableware. Preconceptions formed over generations are not changed overnight. And what about that traditional market of county couples and maiden aunts? What will they make of relief- mould-free black-and-white Jasper? Has Wedgwood regained its past only to ruin its future? Jill Sharrock thinks not. \"New directions are risky,\" she says, \"but what Nick has produced is so simple in its modernity that I believe it is a modern classic. I do not believe the range is contrived or difficult, but handles sculptural, functional form in a way that good design transcends time. Context will make the product modern or traditional.\" And clever marketing will make it a success or failure \u0095 The Nick Munro Jasper Collection for Wedgwood goes on sale in mid-March.

      "body": "<p>At first glance, the dog lovers described below might look as if they treat their animals as if they were their own children. But they pour scorn on that comparison, and so do I. The fact is, a child is human and a dog is a creature. There is an intriguing world of a difference. When we say, \"Fetch\", and the dog fetches, we are reaching out to a whole other species and finding common ground.</p> <p>We have always been desperate to forge contact with other worlds, something outside humanity that can give us context. Sadly, God, ghosts and space aliens have so far been loath to break their indomitable silences. Dogs are the only non-humans among us that are willing - indeed excited - to lollop over and provide some inter-speciel accord.</p> <p>Far from being a child replacement, the dog offers us an insight into our place in the infinite. We have conquered, through communication, a creature with inhuman characteristics, with a whole different set of genes and chemicals. We have made them love us so much that they'll wait at the window for us to come home; they'll even lie on our graves when we die. This is profound and transcendental.</p> <p>It's hardly surprising, then, that we sometimes go that extra mile and buy them a few little gifts - Gucci dog-collars and pet aromatherapy balms - or even give them their own bedrooms with specially designed, dog-friendly wallpaper and bedclothes.</p> <p>Anti-dog naysayers may shun this analysis, but how about this: experiments undertaken by Professor Rupert Sheldrake have proved beyond any doubt that dogs possess psychic abilities way beyond our comprehension. This is how the experiment works. Sheldrake gives his dog-owning assistant a bleeper. She then goes about her daily duties - she sits in a cafe, or visits friends, or gets her hair cut. In the meantime, her dog is filmed with a hidden camcorder as he goes about his canine routine. Some random hours later, Sheldrake, sitting in a third location, bleeps the assistant. This is her signal to come home. The moment this happens, the dog instantaneously leaps to the window and waits, tongue a-lolling, until she pulls up in the driveway. The success rate of this experiment is roughly 80%. (The two times out of 10 that it fails, by the way, is most often explained by the nearby presence of a bitch on heat. Only sexual opportunities come between a dog and its owner.) Dog lovers, such as those in these photographs, will not be surprised by these findings. Affectionate little psychic moments occur every day. \"Shall I give him a walk?\" they think to themselves. And the dogs immediately leap to their feet and rush towards the door.</p> <p>It could have all gone so wrong. We cannot overlook the fact that dogs have it well within their power to tear chunks out of us with their teeth so, when an inter-speciel equanimity occurs, it is only right that we reward it.</p> <p>But in some other countries, it has all gone so badly wrong. They are killing the dogs in Bucharest. Nobody opposes this systematic, state-sanctioned slaughter programme. Diseased or not, they are all fair game. Why should this be? On a dog-to-dog basis, they are, on the surface, no less delightful than our own. They are similarly droopy, they carry themselves with an adorable bathos. They are not particularly dangerous - most are too hungry to muster up the requisite energy needed to attack. They just lie there in wastelands in the sun. Yet their death-row status is unanimously endorsed. The Romanian people are alarmed by the dogs, and so the dogs must die. I am alarmed by them, too. They are in some ways different from the dogs that bound up to me on Hampstead Heath. What makes the dogs of Bucharest so horrifying is their sheer volume. There are too many of them. In bulk, anthropomorphism cannot take place. They are menacing strangers without endearing traits. Their crime is that they are not owned.</p> <p>It is our ownership of dogs, our control over them, that endears us to them. \"No!\" we shout. \"No! No! No!\" And then we whack them on the nose. This is very different from our relationship with, say, horses. We do not like dogs to possess an overpowering majesty. We do not stand back in awe while they gallop across fields. If dogs behave like horses (ie with uncontrolled majesty), we yell, \"Come back! No! No!\" And then we whack them on the nose. I witness this nose-whacking on a daily basis - in the cafe, or on the street. Who hasn't? Most often, this punishment seems too harsh for the crime. The nose-whackers are not common thugs. They are you and I. This makes me presume that nose-whacking is not a rational act. It is not something that we humans reluctantly do to domesticate our dogs. I think that we are helplessly drawn to the act of nose-whacking in as profound a way as the dogs are drawn to the window to wait for us to come home. The momentum is that of imperialism, of conquering another life form. In this, our relationship with dogs can be perverse and sadistic.</p> <p>Of course, not all dog-owners are sadistic perverts. The people in these photographs, for instance, seem very nice. Dawna Walter is considered crazy for providing her poodles with dog chairs, dog toys, framed photographs of dog pals and even a little goldfish pet of their own. Others treat their dogs to manicures, Perspex Gucci beds, Paul Smith fauna conditioner, \u00a3135 cashmere coats from Browns of South Molton Street, foie gras at Christmas, and Campari and soda after dinner.</p> <p>Some of them say that being around a dog makes us recognise our own animality. When we see a dog pissing outdoors or jumping a bitch on heat, it reminds us of the animal that lives within us all. But this is disingenuous. We love to anthropomorphise our dogs. We love to humanise them. This is animality-recognition lite. This is tourism. If we really wanted a mirror on our bestial instincts, we wouldn't be killing the dogs in Bucharest. They're the ones that really reflect our animalistic temperament - scrawny and bleak and inhuman and purposeless. But perhaps that's too close to home. Maybe that's why we're really killing them - they remind us too much of the beast that lives within us.</p> <p>Some say that dog-owners have a lower blood pressure than the rest of us. This is, of course, more proof that owning a dog is nothing like raising a child. I haven't slept in a year-and-a-half since my son was born. My nerves are shattered. Dogs don't do that to you. If they did, you could just whack them on the nose and put them in the shed. The thirtysomething dog-owning couples I see on Hampstead Heath seem a damned sight less stressed out than me.</p> <p>But I, in turn, seem a damned sight less stressed out than those thirtysomething couples who have neither a baby nor a dog, who wander the paths of the heath without purpose, who are taking nobody but themselves for a walk.</p> <p>Around a year ago, I approached a woman from Congelton called Barbara McGarry because I wanted to write about the search for her lost sheepdog, Noah. Barbara told me the story. The weather was beautiful the day that Noah vanished. It was a lovely sunny day. But two freak claps of thun der rang out, startling Noah, who bolted over a nine-foot gate. Noah was a popular and well-known dog in the village, and within an hour the police and a hundred locals were searching the fields for him.</p> <p>I met Barbara two years later. She's a sensible-looking farmer. \"This is literally the first day off I've had in two years looking for him,\" she said. \"I've done everything. I've combed the area with scent cloths attached to my body. We've advertised and advertised and searched and searched. I can't believe we haven't found him. I've done silly things. I even wrote to Brigitte Bardot.\"</p> <p>She laughed, sadly. \"I mean, what could she do in France? But I have to do something every day. The day I wrote to Brigitte Bardot was a low-ebb day.\" She paused. \"And then somebody suggested Camilla.\" I looked over at Camilla, a dog psychic, sitting in a long purple velvet dress in the corner. She nodded, in all seriousness.</p> <p>\"What does your husband think of this?\" I asked Barbara. \"He's doing everything he can to make me stop,\" she said. \"He's bought me two llamas, some pygmy goats, a parrot, a cat, lots of other dogs. He says, 'Enough now. Give your love to all these other animals.' But how can I stop? I've even walked the llamas around the countryside hoping Noah will pick up the scent.\"</p> <p>\"And how do you know that Noah is alive?\" I asked Camilla, the dog psychic.</p> <p>\"I've tuned into my spirit guides and Noah's spiritual guides,\" she replied, \"and when he bolted in the thunderstorm he went into a time warp and he became a little boy. He used to be a little boy in a school uniform in a previous life . . .\"</p> <p>Barbara smiled. For a while, Camilla carried on talking about Noah's previous lives. My eyes glazed over. I was finding it hard to follow, and I was annoyed by Camilla's nonsense. \"So Noah thought he was a little boy again, so he sped off to a boarding school,\" she continued. \"He found this independent boarding school, and now he's being looked after by a lady in her early 50s, of Swedish or German origin, I feel, and he's being looked after well . . .\" Barbara nodded.</p> <p>\"But he would like to come home now,\" said Camilla. Barbara began to cry. \"I've started looking at all the independent boarding schools in my county,\" she said. \"Now I'm starting to go further west . . .\"</p> <p>I left them both that afternoon with bad thoughts for Camilla. How could she keep Barbara hoping, with all that rubbish about time warps? I elected then not to write their story. It was too sad, and Camilla was, for me, too unsympathetic a character.</p> <p>Now that I recall the tale, I remember something else that Barbara said to me: \"You can't help who you fall in love with,\" she said. \"I'm not mad. I didn't plan my emotions. I just happen to have fallen in love with Noah.\"</p> <p>You can look at the photographs here and see eccentrics with more money than sense, willing to lavish huge sums on their dogs. Perhaps these photographs tell us something about our current economic boom. But in them I see love affairs; strange love affairs, based on metaphysical communications and the most primordial of human instincts. I see rational people whose hearts have led them in irrational ways</p> <p><b>Barking permit</b></p> <p>Serena Rees and Joe Corre, of the lingerie store Agent Provocateur, have a wire-haired fox terrier called Roman, a sharp urban hound who nevertheless enjoys lavish attention at the company's London office.</p> <p>'He sits under the table on a red sheepskin, and I'm sure everyone likes having him around,' says Rees (pictured left). 'But he's not really a designer, diamant\u00e9-collar sort of dog.'</p> <p>One of Roman's two baskets has Vivienne Westwood lining - the celebrated designer is Corre's mother - and he regularly attends a top salon called Peter's Posh Pets for a manicure.</p> <p>'He looks incredible when he's just been quiffed,' says Rees, who has taken him to several gala openings and drinks parties. Roman also receives a lot of attention on the street.</p> <p>'Loads of people say, \"I used to have one of those toy dogs with a handle and wheels\",' says Rees. 'And Japanese people go mad and even film him.'</p> <p>Yet Rees does not, she says, spoil Roman unduly. 'It's like having children: you make sure they don't take over your life. I don't want toys everywhere. He's part of our life, and vice versa.' And Roman does not receive expensive gifts. 'He's not a glitzy dog,' she adds. 'Anyway, I'm sure he wouldn't be seen in Gucci or Prada - although I'm sure he'd make an exception for Herm\u00e8s.'</p> <p>Roman has no special favours at suppertime, though she does withhold the Pedigree Chum.</p> <p>'I can't bear opening the tin. And it makes him fart a lot, which we don't like.' Instead, Roman eats dry food made by Hills. 'We eat organic ourselves, but I'm not about to buy organic food for him. He is loved and cared for; but let's face it, he's a dog.'</p> <p><b> Paw relations</b></p> <p>The interior designer Cath Kidston, who runs a shop in London's Notting Hill, has a Lakeland terrier called Stanley, upon whom she dotes. 'He's the nearest thing you can get to a live teddy bear,' she says.</p> <p>Brought up as a dog nut, she has owned Stanley for two years, since she bought him in Gretna Green. 'I'm lucky that I live very close to a park, so we can go for walkies easily,' says Kidston. 'He comes into the shop, then he goes to this lovely lady called Jo, who takes him and 10 friends to the park.' So regal is Stanley that, on the way, he insists on sitting in the front seat of the car.</p> <p>At home, Kidston treats him 'exactly like a person'. He is allowed on sofas and beds - it helps that his breed doesn't moult. She is careful to give both Stanley and her seven-year-old stepdaughter equal attention, but she no longer takes him to parties. 'It was rather like those people who turn up everywhere with a baby on their hip,' she says.</p> <p>Foodwise, Stanley has authentic northern tastes - his favourite is tripe. 'Sadly, he loves it. The people before me fed him from the local abattoir - I think he developed a fashionable taste for offal.'</p> <p>Like the new urban dogs, Stanley is well-groomed - if somewhat reluctantly. 'A fantastic woman called Sharon comes around and gives him a topiary . . . He always seems to be a bit embarrassed afterwards.' And he owns clothes, though Kidston insists that he shies away from designer goods. 'He has a polo-neck jumper that really suits him.'</p> <p>Luckily, there is lots of Lakeland terrier merchandise available to buy, courtesy of the Lakeland Terrier Society, which now has a website. 'You can even buy \"Lakie\" earrings,' she enthuses.</p> <p>While he is at the shop, so many people take pictures of Stanley that Kidston is considering a range of T-shirts with his picture on. 'He gets attention wherever he goes,' she says. 'Old ladies love him, and even tough builders coo, \"Isn't he cute?\" '</p> <p>Does Stanley cost a lot? 'The dog-walking is the real extravagance, but as I gave up cigarettes, I see it as my old smoking money,' says Kidston. The only time that she feels like disowning him, she confesses, is when he 'wees on sports bags in the park'.</p> <p><b> Woof diamonds</b></p> <p>Dawna Walter, a Bostonian who runs the storage chain The Holding Company, spends more than \u00a3100 a week on her two magnificent poodles - Sydney and Lola. A canine obsessive, she has given the two dogs a room of their own, full of their own chairs, toys, framed snaps of dog pals, and even a goldfish for relaxation.</p> <p>Is this not a touch decadent? 'I'm sure people think I'm doolally,' she says, admitting that she gets odd pangs of guilt. 'One Japanese visitor said that the dogs' room was big enough for four people to sleep in. I felt terrible.'</p> <p>But the pleasure she takes from her fluffy charges outweighs any misgivings. She is an enthusiastic consumer of dog paraphernalia, culled mostly from American sources - designer Todd Oldham's mail-order company, George, is a favourite - and among Sydney and Lola's effects are dog bowls by Paul Smith, bone motif geegaws and canine-grooming unguents such as 'fauna conditioner with grapefruit and lavender'. The dogs receive birthday presents, and 'get to open Paul Smith packaging, which is pretty cool.'</p> <p>'You do sometimes anthropomorphise,' she says. 'But I am aware that they are dogs and treat them accordingly.' She likes poodles because they are 'intelligent and curious', and is emotionally enmeshed in their family experiences. When, for example, Sydney whelped nine puppies, she kept one, Lola, because 'I wanted a white bitch.' Her dogs have a life that would be the envy of many people. They get regular massages and eat as well as the local 'ladies who lunch', with a brasserie menu of organic chicken, beef and vegetables. 'Last night, they had salmon fishcakes and garlic mash.' They even drink: 'Sydney likes a Southern Comfort Manhattan, while Lola is a lush and likes anything.' But they never eat from the table or beg. 'Oh no -animals have their place.'</p> <p>Sydney and Lola's social whirl includes walks in Battersea Park, coffee in Starbucks, and trips to pubs and even clubs. In business hours, a dog-walker takes them on their Fulham passeggiata. 'They know more people than I do. I walk down the road and people say \"Hi\" to them, not to me. Kylie Minogue is a friend of Sydney.'</p> <p>Do they force compromise on to her interior decor? 'I would not have wall-to-wall carpeting, as puppies make mistakes; no poisonous plants, such as poinsettias; and heavily- polished wooden floors often get scratched.' But, despite the pampering, she keeps them in check. 'Dogs are pack animals, and you have to let them know who is the alpha dog in the house, otherwise they walk all over you. I'm the boss here.'</p>",

They are similarly droopy, they carry themselves with an adorable bathos. They are not particularly dangerous - most are too hungry to muster up the requisite energy needed to attack. They just lie there in wastelands in the sun. Yet their death-row status is unanimously endorsed. The Romanian people are alarmed by the dogs, and so the dogs must die. I am alarmed by them, too. They are in some ways different from the dogs that bound up to me on Hampstead Heath. What makes the dogs of Bucharest so horrifying is their sheer volume. There are too many of them. In bulk, anthropomorphism cannot take place. They are menacing strangers without endearing traits. Their crime is that they are not owned. It is our ownership of dogs, our control over them, that endears us to them. \"No!\" we shout. \"No! No! No!\" And then we whack them on the nose. This is very different from our relationship with, say, horses. We do not like dogs to possess an overpowering majesty. We do not stand back in awe while they gallop across fields. If dogs behave like horses (ie with uncontrolled majesty), we yell, \"Come back! No! No!\" And then we whack them on the nose. I witness this nose-whacking on a daily basis - in the cafe, or on the street. Who hasn't? Most often, this punishment seems too harsh for the crime. The nose-whackers are not common thugs. They are you and I. This makes me presume that nose-whacking is not a rational act. It is not something that we humans reluctantly do to domesticate our dogs. I think that we are helplessly drawn to the act of nose-whacking in as profound a way as the dogs are drawn to the window to wait for us to come home. The momentum is that of imperialism, of conquering another life form. In this, our relationship with dogs can be perverse and sadistic. Of course, not all dog-owners are sadistic perverts. The people in these photographs, for instance, seem very nice. Dawna Walter is considered crazy for providing her poodles with dog chairs, dog toys, framed photographs of dog pals and even a little goldfish pet of their own. Others treat their dogs to manicures, Perspex Gucci beds, Paul Smith fauna conditioner, \u00a3135 cashmere coats from Browns of South Molton Street, foie gras at Christmas, and Campari and soda after dinner. Some of them say that being around a dog makes us recognise our own animality. When we see a dog pissing outdoors or jumping a bitch on heat, it reminds us of the animal that lives within us all. But this is disingenuous. We love to anthropomorphise our dogs. We love to humanise them. This is animality-recognition lite. This is tourism. If we really wanted a mirror on our bestial instincts, we wouldn't be killing the dogs in Bucharest. They're the ones that really reflect our animalistic temperament - scrawny and bleak and inhuman and purposeless. But perhaps that's too close to home. Maybe that's why we're really killing them - they remind us too much of the beast that lives within us. Some say that dog-owners have a lower blood pressure than the rest of us. This is, of course, more proof that owning a dog is nothing like raising a child. I haven't slept in a year-and-a-half since my son was born. My nerves are shattered. Dogs don't do that to you. If they did, you could just whack them on the nose and put them in the shed. The thirtysomething dog-owning couples I see on Hampstead Heath seem a damned sight less stressed out than me. But I, in turn, seem a damned sight less stressed out than those thirtysomething couples who have neither a baby nor a dog, who wander the paths of the heath without purpose, who are taking nobody but themselves for a walk. Around a year ago, I approached a woman from Congelton called Barbara McGarry because I wanted to write about the search for her lost sheepdog, Noah. Barbara told me the story. The weather was beautiful the day that Noah vanished. It was a lovely sunny day. But two freak claps of thun der rang out, startling Noah, who bolted over a nine-foot gate. Noah was a popular and well-known dog in the village, and within an hour the police and a hundred locals were searching the fields for him. I met Barbara two years later. She's a sensible-looking farmer. \"This is literally the first day off I've had in two years looking for him,\" she said. \"I've done everything. I've combed the area with scent cloths attached to my body. We've advertised and advertised and searched and searched. I can't believe we haven't found him. I've done silly things. I even wrote to Brigitte Bardot.\" She laughed, sadly. \"I mean, what could she do in France? But I have to do something every day. The day I wrote to Brigitte Bardot was a low-ebb day.\" She paused. \"And then somebody suggested Camilla.\" I looked over at Camilla, a dog psychic, sitting in a long purple velvet dress in the corner. She nodded, in all seriousness. \"What does your husband think of this?\" I asked Barbara. \"He's doing everything he can to make me stop,\" she said. \"He's bought me two llamas, some pygmy goats, a parrot, a cat, lots of other dogs. He says, 'Enough now. Give your love to all these other animals.' But how can I stop? I've even walked the llamas around the countryside hoping Noah will pick up the scent.\" \"And how do you know that Noah is alive?\" I asked Camilla, the dog psychic. \"I've tuned into my spirit guides and Noah's spiritual guides,\" she replied, \"and when he bolted in the thunderstorm he went into a time warp and he became a little boy. He used to be a little boy in a school uniform in a previous life . . .\" Barbara smiled. For a while, Camilla carried on talking about Noah's previous lives. My eyes glazed over. I was finding it hard to follow, and I was annoyed by Camilla's nonsense. \"So Noah thought he was a little boy again, so he sped off to a boarding school,\" she continued. \"He found this independent boarding school, and now he's being looked after by a lady in her early 50s, of Swedish or German origin, I feel, and he's being looked after well . . .\" Barbara nodded. \"But he would like to come home now,\" said Camilla. Barbara began to cry. \"I've started looking at all the independent boarding schools in my county,\" she said. \"Now I'm starting to go further west . . .\" I left them both that afternoon with bad thoughts for Camilla. How could she keep Barbara hoping, with all that rubbish about time warps? I elected then not to write their story. It was too sad, and Camilla was, for me, too unsympathetic a character. Now that I recall the tale, I remember something else that Barbara said to me: \"You can't help who you fall in love with,\" she said. \"I'm not mad. I didn't plan my emotions. I just happen to have fallen in love with Noah.\" You can look at the photographs here and see eccentrics with more money than sense, willing to lavish huge sums on their dogs. Perhaps these photographs tell us something about our current economic boom. But in them I see love affairs; strange love affairs, based on metaphysical communications and the most primordial of human instincts. I see rational people whose hearts have led them in irrational ways Barking permit Serena Rees and Joe Corre, of the lingerie store Agent Provocateur, have a wire-haired fox terrier called Roman, a sharp urban hound who nevertheless enjoys lavish attention at the company's London office. 'He sits under the table on a red sheepskin, and I'm sure everyone likes having him around,' says Rees (pictured left). 'But he's not really a designer, diamant\u00e9-collar sort of dog.' One of Roman's two baskets has Vivienne Westwood lining - the celebrated designer is Corre's mother - and he regularly attends a top salon called Peter's Posh Pets for a manicure. 'He looks incredible when he's just been quiffed,' says Rees, who has taken him to several gala openings and drinks parties. Roman also receives a lot of attention on the street. 'Loads of people say, \"I used to have one of those toy dogs with a handle and wheels\",' says Rees. 'And Japanese people go mad and even film him.' Yet Rees does not, she says, spoil Roman unduly. 'It's like having children: you make sure they don't take over your life. I don't want toys everywhere. He's part of our life, and vice versa.' And Roman does not receive expensive gifts. 'He's not a glitzy dog,' she adds. 'Anyway, I'm sure he wouldn't be seen in Gucci or Prada - although I'm sure he'd make an exception for Herm\u00e8s.' Roman has no special favours at suppertime, though she does withhold the Pedigree Chum. 'I can't bear opening the tin. And it makes him fart a lot, which we don't like.' Instead, Roman eats dry food made by Hills. 'We eat organic ourselves, but I'm not about to buy organic food for him. He is loved and cared for; but let's face it, he's a dog.' Paw relations The interior designer Cath Kidston, who runs a shop in London's Notting Hill, has a Lakeland terrier called Stanley, upon whom she dotes. 'He's the nearest thing you can get to a live teddy bear,' she says. Brought up as a dog nut, she has owned Stanley for two years, since she bought him in Gretna Green. 'I'm lucky that I live very close to a park, so we can go for walkies easily,' says Kidston. 'He comes into the shop, then he goes to this lovely lady called Jo, who takes him and 10 friends to the park.' So regal is Stanley that, on the way, he insists on sitting in the front seat of the car. At home, Kidston treats him 'exactly like a person'. He is allowed on sofas and beds - it helps that his breed doesn't moult. She is careful to give both Stanley and her seven-year-old stepdaughter equal attention, but she no longer takes him to parties. 'It was rather like those people who turn up everywhere with a baby on their hip,' she says. Foodwise, Stanley has authentic northern tastes - his favourite is tripe. 'Sadly, he loves it. The people before me fed him from the local abattoir - I think he developed a fashionable taste for offal.' Like the new urban dogs, Stanley is well-groomed - if somewhat reluctantly. 'A fantastic woman called Sharon comes around and gives him a topiary . . . He always seems to be a bit embarrassed afterwards.' And he owns clothes, though Kidston insists that he shies away from designer goods. 'He has a polo-neck jumper that really suits him.' Luckily, there is lots of Lakeland terrier merchandise available to buy, courtesy of the Lakeland Terrier Society, which now has a website. 'You can even buy \"Lakie\" earrings,' she enthuses. While he is at the shop, so many people take pictures of Stanley that Kidston is considering a range of T-shirts with his picture on. 'He gets attention wherever he goes,' she says. 'Old ladies love him, and even tough builders coo, \"Isn't he cute?\" ' Does Stanley cost a lot? 'The dog-walking is the real extravagance, but as I gave up cigarettes, I see it as my old smoking money,' says Kidston. The only time that she feels like disowning him, she confesses, is when he 'wees on sports bags in the park'. Woof diamonds Dawna Walter, a Bostonian who runs the storage chain The Holding Company, spends more than \u00a3100 a week on her two magnificent poodles - Sydney and Lola. A canine obsessive, she has given the two dogs a room of their own, full of their own chairs, toys, framed snaps of dog pals, and even a goldfish for relaxation. Is this not a touch decadent? 'I'm sure people think I'm doolally,' she says, admitting that she gets odd pangs of guilt. 'One Japanese visitor said that the dogs' room was big enough for four people to sleep in. I felt terrible.' But the pleasure she takes from her fluffy charges outweighs any misgivings. She is an enthusiastic consumer of dog paraphernalia, culled mostly from American sources - designer Todd Oldham's mail-order company, George, is a favourite - and among Sydney and Lola's effects are dog bowls by Paul Smith, bone motif geegaws and canine-grooming unguents such as 'fauna conditioner with grapefruit and lavender'. The dogs receive birthday presents, and 'get to open Paul Smith packaging, which is pretty cool.' 'You do sometimes anthropomorphise,' she says. 'But I am aware that they are dogs and treat them accordingly.' She likes poodles because they are 'intelligent and curious', and is emotionally enmeshed in their family experiences. When, for example, Sydney whelped nine puppies, she kept one, Lola, because 'I wanted a white bitch.' Her dogs have a life that would be the envy of many people. They get regular massages and eat as well as the local 'ladies who lunch', with a brasserie menu of organic chicken, beef and vegetables. 'Last night, they had salmon fishcakes and garlic mash.' They even drink: 'Sydney likes a Southern Comfort Manhattan, while Lola is a lush and likes anything.' But they never eat from the table or beg. 'Oh no -animals have their place.' Sydney and Lola's social whirl includes walks in Battersea Park, coffee in Starbucks, and trips to pubs and even clubs. In business hours, a dog-walker takes them on their Fulham passeggiata. 'They know more people than I do. I walk down the road and people say \"Hi\" to them, not to me. Kylie Minogue is a friend of Sydney.' Do they force compromise on to her interior decor? 'I would not have wall-to-wall carpeting, as puppies make mistakes; no poisonous plants, such as poinsettias; and heavily- polished wooden floors often get scratched.' But, despite the pampering, she keeps them in check. 'Dogs are pack animals, and you have to let them know who is the alpha dog in the house, otherwise they walk all over you. I'm the boss here.'",

      "body": "<p>Last autumn, that mouthpiece of the medical profession, the British Medical Journal, began publishing a peace treaty. It took the form of a 12-part series on complementary medicine. This is the same BMJ that 20 years ago declared, in a dismissive editorial, that alternative medicine \"ought to be as extinct as divination by examination of bird's entrails\". The BMJ series was a belated recognition of a victory by a ragged guerrilla army that, starting far beyond the medical pale, has gradually marched on the capital and is now sitting around the tables with the generals of the medical empire, discussing exactly how many positions it will have in the new government.</p> <p>Today, every high street has its health-food shop, and it's hard to open a newspaper or a magazine without finding a cure that involves mega doses of vitamin C, a stress-reducing massage or a tincture of St John's Wort. We can buy soya snack bars that claim to fight off both prostate cancer and the menopause, eat ginkgo biloba-enriched crisps that boost the flow of blood to the head, and relax in the evening with a couple of tabs of (perfectly legal) kava kava.</p> <p>So how has it happened? How have the health irregulars - homoeopaths with their weird belief in minuscule doses, acupuncturists locating undetectable meridians, and herbalists mired in the Middle Ages - conspired to storm one of the great professional citadels? Scientific medicine now seems like some fallen empire. Despite all its pharmacological weaponry and coffers stacked with gold, it is having to make peace with bands of amiable civilians. What is this going to do to our health? Is it a good thing, or have we succumbed to a dreadful delusion?</p> <p>Part of the explanation lies with Clara, and the hundreds of thousands like her, who found that modern medicine wasn't providing what she wanted, so, sophisticated shopper that she is, took her business elsewhere. A 48-year-old freelance accountant, Clara had gone to her GP complaining of being tired and irritable. She was working very hard and also putting on weight. He prescribed hormone-replacement therapy (HRT). Then she developed irritable-bowel syndrome and was offered steroids. So she went to see the naturopath, Elizabeth Gray Gibaud, who has a practice at the Hale Clinic in London, and specialises in \"face diagnosis\".</p> <p>\"A particular puffiness beneath the eyes suggested problems with her colon, and a strong cubical fold below the tip of her nose, plus a reddish-brown colour, suggested trouble in the region of her womb,\" says Gibaud. \"A different colouring around her mouth indicated a mineral deficiency, which checked out when I asked about rough skin.\" So Clara went on a detox diet for six weeks. She found she had various food allergies - to coffee, red wine and wheat - and she took a range of herbs, vitamin supplements and minerals. It was a big success: \"I've lost about two-and-a-half stone, my son says I'm a different person, and I'm happier and have more energy than ever before.\"</p> <p>This is precisely the sort of thing that orthodox medicine (OM) has for years been lumping with divination. Mere anecdote, say the hardliners, and if the regimen does have an effect then it is probably as a placebo - if you believe that you will get better, then you probably will, however cranky the treatment you get. Where are the clinical trials that show the value of this treatment on a controlled group? What is the active ingredient in the herbs? Large doses of vitamins are just a way of producing expensive urine.</p> <p>But the Claras took no notice. Guerrilla armies depend on popular support and, while the establishment jeered, the patients voted with their wallets. Five million to nine million of us in the UK use complementary medicine (CM) regularly; two years ago (the last date for which figures are available) at least 15 million CM consultations took place.</p> <p>Faced with this widespread dissatisfaction among its patients, the tone of the medical empire became more shrill. Here is Dr Eric Rose, of the British Medical Association, responding to a report in 1998 that there were now more complementary practitioners than GPs in the UK: \"My main concern is the dogma surrounding this type of medicine. You see some ridiculous claims - eat six tins of stewed rhubarb and you will get better.\" In-house magazines felt free to be even more disparaging, employing a little racism along the way: \"Medications of the mysterious East\" is how a columnist writing in Doctor magazine recently described Chinese herbal treatments for eczema. They were, he wrote, \"the inscrutable Dr Fu ManChu's magic eczema potion\". The echoes of other empires that ignored a rising tide of demand and suffered for it can be heard all too clearly: British Telecom before privatisa tion, British Airways in the face of the smaller and nimbler Virgin, IBM ignoring the threat of the PC.</p> <p>But the CM irregulars weren't just supplying a need; their style chimed perfectly with wider social changes. The consumer revolution and the rise of the entrepreneur, although possibly distasteful to many of the practitioners personally, meshed perfectly with their philosophy. A greater concern with the body beautiful brought a greater concern with personal health. It was a small step from the fixed weights and the treadmill to vitamins and supplements. What was going on in the gyms and juice bars marched in step with one of the big ideas in medicine in the 80s and early 90s - the link between lifestyle and heart disease. But while OM, in the authoritarian style of the industrial giants of the past, instructed the nation to cut back on fat, the CM irregulars offered a personal service: just as mail-shots target particular postcodes, or loyalty cards enable supermarkets to track your personal spending patterns, so they could satisfy the Claras by tailoring a package for each one.</p> <p>\"Complementary medicine has definitely been piggy-backing on the rise of consumer power,\" says Andrew Vickers, author of the BMJ series and director of research at the Research Council for Complementary Medicine. \"People are changing the way they relate to authority figures. The doctor is there to serve you, just as banks and the phone service are.\" CM practitioners also tapped into one of the greatest sources of medical power since ancient times. Until five years ago, doctors had a lock on medical information. Even though your rash never seemed to clear up or your joints remained painfully stiff, the local doctor was the only one who could diagnose the problem and provide a remedy. That all changed with the advent of the internet.</p> <p>Suddenly, a wealth of information on every condition imaginable was just a few clicks of a mouse away. Within hours, if you were determined enough, you could know more than your GP about the causes of those blinding headaches and possible remedies. What's more, on the net, the divisions between orthodox and complementary vanish: every treatment is just one of dozens that come up in the window of your search engine. Of course, there are dangers, and misinformation is a problem, but OM's secret weapon, omniscience, had been disabled.</p> <p>The medical establishment has always liked to claim that its expertise is based on scientific evidence. Treatments are tested and based on the most rigorous research, so the story goes, while beyond their orthodoxy is the world of cranks and charlatans, making wild claims, relying on mere anecdote.</p> <p>\"The greatest appeal of complementary medicine is not scientific or practical,\" argues Marcia Agnell, editor of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine and a long-time opponent of alternative medicine. \"It is religious. Like most religions, it has charismatic personalities, who instead of doing research or publishing in scientific journals, promote their beliefs in books for the public, largely composed of inspirational testimonials.\"</p> <p>But the struggle between the establishment and the health irregulars has not just been a war of words. In the US, the Federal Drugs Administration (FDA) has a long history of taking legal action against those practising CM. In 1962, for instance, a Vermont grandmother was taken to court for selling yeast to pregnant women and making health claims for it in a leaflet. And in 1992, the consulting rooms of a nutritionist and doctor Jonathan Wright were raided by armed police officers and FDA officials who took away vitamin and mineral supplements. Others have been arrested while lecturing about vitamins, and nutritionists have been put under electronic surveillance. The FDA has also targeted alternative cancer treatments, while a Committee on Quackery, set up by the American Medical Association (AMA) in 1964, specifically denounced a form of spinal manipulation known as chiropractic. In 1987, a court found the AMA guilty of conspiring to destroy the profession of chiropractic.</p> <p>In Britain, an equally virulent campaign against CM practitioners has been conducted, largely through the media. It peaked about a decade ago when OM mounted what can now be seen as a desperate rearguard action. In 1989, the Campaign Against Health Fraud (CAHF), later renamed HealthWatch, was set up. Modelled on the self-styled \"quackbusters\" of the American National Council Against Health Fraud, its stated aim was to protect the sick and vulnerable from being exploited by ruthless quacks, peddling unproven and useless or dangerous cures. Its launch was marked by a newspaper article alleging, with no evidence, that \"a growing number of women were dying of breast cancer because they were putting themselves in the hands of quacks rather than orthodox specialists\". In his remarkably detailed book, Dirty Medicine, which exhaustively chronicles this time, Martin Walker claims that many of those involved in the campaign were linked in various ways with the large pharmaceutical and food companies, which had a vested interest in demolishing any alternative medical approaches that threatened their supremacy.</p> <p>Walker alleges that talk about scientific testing and rigour was actually a cloak for a far more commercial agenda. He shows how the most relentless rubbishing of alternatives - and the character-assassination of practitioners that went with it - occurred during the years that the Aids drug AZT was being trialled in the UK between the late 80s and 1992. The organisers of an Aids-information group, Positive Health, for instance, were attacked for \"exploiting people with Aids\". Their crime? Providing a forum to discuss orthodox and alternative treatments, and to organise workshops that taught basic meditation and provided information on diet and vitamins. At the same time, attempts by perfectly respectable scientists to set up proper trials of promising herbal or supplement-based Aids treatments were rejected out of hand.</p> <p>Perhaps the most compelling example that what was going on was not a battle between science and superstition, but one between establishment power and would-be reformers, is what happened to the Bristol Cancer Help Centre. Based on the idea that your best chance of living with, or even surviving, cancer lay with a healthy, effective immune system, the centre advocated an organic, largely vegetarian diet. By the mid-80s, it was confident enough to agree to a clinical trial of its effectiveness by the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. This looked like one of the few serious attempts to test an alternative approach, yet it proved to be the basis of yet another highly damaging and totally irresponsible assault. In 1990, with maximum publicity, the Lancet published some \"interim\" results, based on data from only 18 months of a study supposed to last five years. Its devastating conclusion was that women who had been treated with the Bristol Cancer Help Centre's diet were, in fact, twice as likely to die as those who received conventional treatment. The press had a field-day. Headlines such as \"Danger in a veggie cure for cancer\" and \"Double death risk at veg diet cancer clinic\" filled the papers.</p> <p>Over the succeeding weeks, it became clear that the interim report was seriously flawed. Nearly one-third of the patients classified as having been treated at Bristol had visited the centre only once and had not been on any special diet. Even the OM journal, Hospital Doctor, declared the study \"a fraud\". Eventually, the authors of the report themselves wrote to say they regretted \"that their paper created the impression that the Bristol regime worsened patients' chances\", but the damage had been done and the credibility of the centre was almost destroyed.</p> <p>The evidence is overwhelming that CAHF and its allies were not interested in exploring the scientific basis of such CM approaches as focusing on the role of food allergies in chronic disorders. A considerable body of respectable research supports this approach, known as clinical ecology. Yet the 1990 World In Action investigation into Breakspear Hospital, which specialised in allergies, ignored it all and instead concentrated on the cost of treatment and quoted OM experts who claimed the patients were deluded. The programme relied heavily on CAHF sources.</p> <p>The reaction of the patients involved in all this is very revealing. Instead of thanking the OM spokesmen for saving them from exploitation, in the wake of the attacks on both the Bristol Centre and Breakspear, they formed support committees and tried to get media coverage to put their side of the story. Aids activists forced many conventional doctors in the field to rethink the whole idea of clinical trials and this, too, was a major factor in CM's eventual success.</p> <p>It is against this background that the often-repeated charge that CM is potentially dangerous needs to be examined. Hardline medics regularly tar all CM treatments with the same sceptical brush. While some do require a leap of faith - personally, I find the use of crystals unbelievable, and many theories, such as the idea that high doses of vitamins C and E reduce the risk of strokes, are unproven - the evidence for others is increasingly impressive. It has been slow in coming, for reasons discussed below, but in clinical trials comparing drug and herb treatments, for instance, some herbs have been coming out on top. St John's Wort, for example, has been proven to be as good as pharmaceutical anti-depressants for mild depression - notwithstanding recent concern that there may be dangers in taking it in conjunction with conventional medicines; there is evidence that large doses of the mineral selenium can protect against cancer; and children brought up in a Rudolf Steiner vegetarian community, where they are not treated with drugs or vaccinated, had 40% fewer allergies.</p> <p>There is a strong whiff of hypocrisy in OM's assertion of high scientific principles: its own record of untested and dangerous treatment dwarfs anything achieved by CM. Indeed, according to Dr Ian Chalmers of the UK Cochrane Centre, set up to test medical procedures, about 60% of standard OM treatments have never been subject to proper trials. A dramatic example occurred in September last year, when it was revealed that the conventional treatment for patients with severe shock or burns - albumin - which has been used for the past 30 years, caused an estimated 1,200 extra deaths a year in the UK.</p> <p>An even more shocking departure from the gold standards of science was exposed in October 1999, when we learned of the problems that can follow from not publishing the negative results from clinical trials - a basic scientific requirement. According to Dr Chalmers, had the negative results on the heart drug lorcainide been published at the time, up to 80,000 deaths in the US in the 80s could have been prevented.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the CM camp is trying to establish firm evidence for its claim to treat successfully many of the chronic conditions - such as skin problems, auto-immune disorders and malfunctioning of the gut - with which OM seems to have a particularly poor track record. An estimated 4,000 randomised trials of CM treatments have been carried out, not all to a very high standard, but the number is doubling every five years and the design is improving. In the US, the National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, has a $50-million research budget and last year funded 43 studies, including one investigating the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating alcoholics and another on the value of melatonin in treating Parkinson's disease.</p> <p>There is a very good reason why CM is far more poorly researched than OM: money. The NHS spends roughly 85p on investigating CM for every \u00a3100 it spends on conventional medical research, while pharmaceu- tical companies, the other main source of funding, are not interested in testing the effectiveness of, say, garlic in cutting down heart disease or how diet can lower blood pressure, because they can't take out a patent on it.</p> <p>It is easy to see a conspiracy here, and it's true that, until CM began to gain popularity, the medical profession tended to the view that it was a waste of time to test its treatments. There is a deeper organisational problem, too. \"Unlike doctors in big NHS hospitals,\" says Andrew Vickers of the Research Council for Complementary Medicine, \"alternative practitioners have no research back up. In an NHS hospital, you have not only a ready supply of patients to put into trials, but also a department specifically devoted to research, with statisticians, secretaries, computers, photocopying and so on. So, even if the alternative practitioners do have the training and the inclination to write up research proposals and calculate the statistics, which most of them don't, they still face a big handicap.\"</p> <p>Despite these practical difficulties, a new style of medicine is emerging that aims to cherry-pick the best of both OM and CM. Dubbed integrated medicine, this is the CM practitioners' third name-change in as many decades, each reflecting a change in their status. During the wilderness years, they were alternative; then, as they won some recognition, they turned complementary; now, pushing for a merger, they've become integrated. \"Of course we need to run trials to find out what works best,\" says Dr Mosarif Ali, director of the Integrated Medical Centre in London, \"but we also need to reconnect medicine to its roots. The body is more than just a piece of bio-engineering, and there is more to healing than prescribing drugs.\"</p> <p>So at Ali's clinic, as in many others, you'll get antibiotics, if you really need them, but you'll also get a package of dietary changes, exercise, lifestyle advice and massage. \"Just that package alone clears up 80% of cases,\" Dr Ali claims. However, if it doesn't work on its own, you'll be offered a CM treatment that best fits you and your problem. \"If you had stomach pains,\" he says, \"you might be treated conventionally for a peptic ulcer, but an acupuncturist might treat you for 'deficient liver Qi' and a homoeopath for a 'pulsatilla constitution'.\"</p> <p>Like a medical Luther, Ali is calling for a return to the original medical text. Back to Hippocrates. \"He taught that doctors should fortify the body so that its natural healing power becomes more effective,\" he says. \"Modern medicine has been so blinded by powerful drugs, increasingly minute measurements of cell activity, enzyme levels and suchlike, that it has forgotten the basics.\"</p> <p>Only a few CM diehards would claim that the complementary approach is suitable for every condition. If you are in a car crash, you don't need aromatherapy or echinacea to boost your immune system; you need a casualty ward, heart monitors, anaesthetics and people with a good knowledge of blood chemistry. If your kidneys pack up, you need dialysis and a transplant, and if you develop meningitis, you need antibiotics, fast.</p> <p>But OM's very success - and scientific medicine is undoubtedly one of the triumphs of the past hundred years - can blind us to just what a new kid on the block it is. Just 60 years ago, before the second world war, doctors were pretty impotent. They could make a careful diagnosis and say what the likely outcome was, but, after that, nature was pretty much allowed to take her course. About the only effective remedies in the pre-war OM medicine cabinet were aspirin from willow bark for rheumatic fever, digoxin from foxglove for heart conditions, immunisation for some infections, and salvarsin for syphilis. Meanwhile, children died from diseases such as polio, diphtheria and whooping cough, and adults succumbed to various infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, or puerperal fever, which killed 1,000 women a year in childbirth.</p> <p>Then, within an astonishing 40 years - roughly between 1930 and 1970 - this bleak situation was transformed. Medical breakthroughs dating from that era include penicillin, pap smears for cervical cancer, kidney dialysis, general anaesthesia with curare, cortisone, a cure for tuberculosis, open heart surgery, polio vaccination, the contraceptive pill, hip replacement, kidney transplants, heart transplants and the cure of childhood cancer. \"Magic bullets came cascading out of the lab,\" writes medical journalist James Le Fanu in his recent book, The Rise And Fall Of Modern Medicine, that surveys this period.</p> <p>It was the very success of that revolution that created the conditions that allowed CM to flourish. For instance, two of the stars of those post-war breakthroughs - antibiotics and cortisone - have now come to symbolise much that is wrong with conventional medicine. Antibiotics were undoubtedly a miraculous discovery, vanquishing such major killers as septicaemia, meningitis and pneumonia, but their indiscriminate use and the rise of bacterial resistance has diminished their effectiveness. Cortisone at first appeared to be another astonishing breakthrough, providing immediate relief from the inflammation caused by more than 200 diseases, including rheumatoid athritis, asthma, eczema, gut disorders and kidney problems. But now, 50 years after its first use, cortisone is seen as typical of the failure of conventional medicine: it deals with symptoms, not the underlying disease, and it has a range of unpleasant and damaging side-effects.</p> <p>Two more subtle changes at the heart of the scientific revolution have dramatically altered the way doctors think about patients and what treatments to use. Modern medicine rejected the notion that the doctor should be paramount in deciding how a patient should be treated, and instead turned to statistics. Statistical analysis of double blind trials is both the way to tell if a treatment works and to spot the causes of some diseases, such as the link between lung cancer and smoking. Although this approach has had undoubted success, it has not made medicine as rational and scientific as hoped. \"Statistically derived knowledge has consistently shown itself to be unreliable,\" says Le Fanu. \"It's been shown to result in the adoption of ineffective treatments in 32 per cent of cases or rejection of useful treatment in 33 percent.\"</p> <p>Le Fanu is no friend of CM - he dismissively describes it as a treatment for the \"worried well\" - but his diagnosis of what has gone wrong chimes exactly with the more human and individual approach adopted by integrated medicine. \"Scientific progressivism,\" he says, \"has undermined medicine's most important asset - knowledge-based, practical experience.\"</p> <p>Perhaps even more important in terms of alienating patients has been the transformation of the doctor from patient's advisor to scientific investigator. If you wanted to make a name for yourself during conventional medicine's golden post-war period, it was no good just looking after your patients, you had to research. The heroes of the age no longer just treated patients, they studied them to trace the variations in heart rhythms or to plot the chemical changes during liver failure. \"Patients became interesting clinical material,\" says Le Fanu, \"on which an ambitious young doctor could plan his experiments.\"</p> <p>As one doctor confesses: \"A lot of research you do is of no benefit to the patient, and there is a real possibility you can do them harm.\" Much of research undoubtedly paid of in new treatments, but a bond of trust was put in jeopardy, too. So it was that an entirely new approach to medicine - one that undoubtedly brought incalculable benefits in saving lives and reducing suffering - also alienated the doctors from their client base and created a vacuum at the heart of the profession that CM practitioners have now begun to fill.</p> <p>Will the gentle revolution of CM transform medicine as completely as the scientific revolution did half a century ago? For all its current popularity, its hold is far from secure. On the one hand, a counter-revolution from Europe, inhibiting CM, is a very real possibility. The British are allowed to take higher doses of vitamins and supplements than any other Europeans, and the EU has been pushing for standardised vitamin levels for many years - which would mean a big drop in the legal levels here. (This is what may have lain behind the puzzling and hugely controversial decision by the Labour government, soon after coming to power, to propose a ban on over-the-counter sales of vitamin B6 - commonly used to treat PMT - in doses higher than 10mg. The storm was such that the government backed down.) On the other hand, it is conceivable that the new genetics might eventually provide scientific medicine with the fresh supply of magic bullets that it has been promising: growing new personalised body parts, harvesting human antibodies from transgenic pigs, modifying mutated genes to cure disease, and so on. If it does live up to the hype, CM might be sidelined.</p> <p>Yet the deciphering of the human genome, promised for next year, has implications beyond new, improved drugs and surgery. Writer and genetic activist Jeremy Rifkin suggests that the new genetics has the potential to transform CM, too. Even the best run clinical trials of a drug or herb tell you that people in general get better with it, not whether it will benefit me rather than you. \"With a print-out of your genetic structure, medics will know the kind of diseases and disabilities you are susceptible to,\" says Rifkin. \"Now, suppose that we combine that information with all the new genetic knowledge about plants, and apply it to herbal therapies. We could begin to see exactly who would benefit from soy, who might be better helped with vitamin E and so on.\"</p> <p>Others have a less grandiose view: \"I don't think CM will have the impact of antibiotics or vaccination, which completely transformed medicine,\" says Vickers, \"but it could change the way doctors treat some patients. Many GP's regard CM as the perfect way to deal with 'heart-sink' patients - the ones who keep coming back with vague symptoms they can't do anything about. However, treating them with yoga or art therapy or singing can work wonders. Depending on your point of view, this is either simply the placebo effect at work, or it is a way of responding much more appropriately to the needs of the patient.\"</p> <p>CM could also help develop a hi-tech dimension. Already, the Americans are experimenting with herbal medicines in injectable form: electronic devices, as yet untested, that run weak electronic currents through the body, will, it is hoped, identify a broad spectrum of allergies, deficiencies and weaknesses by analysing the resulting wave forms.</p> <p>The internet will certainly play a much greater part in every sort of medicine, and CM practitioners are just as worried about the dissemination of misleading information as orthodox ones. \"We often have patients turning up with very dodgy supplements that they have found on the web,\" says Dr Rajendra Sharma of the 101 Practitioners Network. So he has raised \u00a317 million from the City to set up a website that he intends to be the definitive place to discover what integrated medicine treatment works best for what disorder.</p> <p>\"If you have a cold, you could discover that your first step should be echinacea or some other plant with anti-viral properties, such as pomegranate, plus vitamin C. Only much later, with bronchial complications, might you take antibiotics.\" For meningitis, meanwhile, you immediately need strong antibiotics, combined with probiotics, a supplement of the beneficial gut bacteria that are killed off by antibiotics, to protect the lining of the gut.</p> <p>For many practitioners, this coming-together of two strands of medicine can only be beneficial. \"We really need to get away from the commplementary-orthodox split,\" says Vickers. \"What everyone wants is a form of medicine that has trials showing that it works, that gives practitioners a code of conduct and that allows patients choice and respect.\"</p> <p>Medicine is both an art and a science, but science has been firmly in the driving seat for 40 years. The arrival of CM practitioners may allow some of the more intangible aspects of the healing profession to re-emerge into the light, such as the power of the doctor's own belief. \"When I was starting out as a doctor, my professor told me about a new migraine drug,\" recalls Marshall Marinker, professor of general practice at the University of London. \"I prescribed it to a number of my patients, and it worked brilliantly. Many were completely cured. But then I began thinking about its mechanisms and how to design a trial, and it somehow stopped working so well. I never again got such good results as when I totally believed in it. I don't think you can measure that sort of thing in clinical trials, but it is absolutely vital to the way medicine should work.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last autumn, that mouthpiece of the medical profession, the British Medical Journal, began publishing a peace treaty. It took the form of a 12-part series on complementary medicine. This is the same BMJ that 20 years ago declared, in a dismissive editorial, that alternative medicine \"ought to be as extinct as divination by examination of bird's entrails\". The BMJ series was a belated recognition of a victory by a ragged guerrilla army that, starting far beyond the medical pale, has gradually marched on the capital and is now sitting around the tables with the generals of the medical empire, discussing exactly how many positions it will have in the new government. Today, every high street has its health-food shop, and it's hard to open a newspaper or a magazine without finding a cure that involves mega doses of vitamin C, a stress-reducing massage or a tincture of St John's Wort. We can buy soya snack bars that claim to fight off both prostate cancer and the menopause, eat ginkgo biloba-enriched crisps that boost the flow of blood to the head, and relax in the evening with a couple of tabs of (perfectly legal) kava kava. So how has it happened? How have the health irregulars - homoeopaths with their weird belief in minuscule doses, acupuncturists locating undetectable meridians, and herbalists mired in the Middle Ages - conspired to storm one of the great professional citadels? Scientific medicine now seems like some fallen empire. Despite all its pharmacological weaponry and coffers stacked with gold, it is having to make peace with bands of amiable civilians. What is this going to do to our health? Is it a good thing, or have we succumbed to a dreadful delusion? Part of the explanation lies with Clara, and the hundreds of thousands like her, who found that modern medicine wasn't providing what she wanted, so, sophisticated shopper that she is, took her business elsewhere. A 48-year-old freelance accountant, Clara had gone to her GP complaining of being tired and irritable. She was working very hard and also putting on weight. He prescribed hormone-replacement therapy (HRT). Then she developed irritable-bowel syndrome and was offered steroids. So she went to see the naturopath, Elizabeth Gray Gibaud, who has a practice at the Hale Clinic in London, and specialises in \"face diagnosis\". \"A particular puffiness beneath the eyes suggested problems with her colon, and a strong cubical fold below the tip of her nose, plus a reddish-brown colour, suggested trouble in the region of her womb,\" says Gibaud. \"A different colouring around her mouth indicated a mineral deficiency, which checked out when I asked about rough skin.\" So Clara went on a detox diet for six weeks. She found she had various food allergies - to coffee, red wine and wheat - and she took a range of herbs, vitamin supplements and minerals. It was a big success: \"I've lost about two-and-a-half stone, my son says I'm a different person, and I'm happier and have more energy than ever before.\" This is precisely the sort of thing that orthodox medicine (OM) has for years been lumping with divination. Mere anecdote, say the hardliners, and if the regimen does have an effect then it is probably as a placebo - if you believe that you will get better, then you probably will, however cranky the treatment you get. Where are the clinical trials that show the value of this treatment on a controlled group? What is the active ingredient in the herbs? Large doses of vitamins are just a way of producing expensive urine. But the Claras took no notice. Guerrilla armies depend on popular support and, while the establishment jeered, the patients voted with their wallets. Five million to nine million of us in the UK use complementary medicine (CM) regularly; two years ago (the last date for which figures are available) at least 15 million CM consultations took place. Faced with this widespread dissatisfaction among its patients, the tone of the medical empire became more shrill. Here is Dr Eric Rose, of the British Medical Association, responding to a report in 1998 that there were now more complementary practitioners than GPs in the UK: \"My main concern is the dogma surrounding this type of medicine. You see some ridiculous claims - eat six tins of stewed rhubarb and you will get better.\" In-house magazines felt free to be even more disparaging, employing a little racism along the way: \"Medications of the mysterious East\" is how a columnist writing in Doctor magazine recently described Chinese herbal treatments for eczema. They were, he wrote, \"the inscrutable Dr Fu ManChu's magic eczema potion\". The echoes of other empires that ignored a rising tide of demand and suffered for it can be heard all too clearly: British Telecom before privatisa tion, British Airways in the face of the smaller and nimbler Virgin, IBM ignoring the threat of the PC. But the CM irregulars weren't just supplying a need; their style chimed perfectly with wider social changes. The consumer revolution and the rise of the entrepreneur, although possibly distasteful to many of the practitioners personally, meshed perfectly with their philosophy. A greater concern with the body beautiful brought a greater concern with personal health. It was a small step from the fixed weights and the treadmill to vitamins and supplements. What was going on in the gyms and juice bars marched in step with one of the big ideas in medicine in the 80s and early 90s - the link between lifestyle and heart disease. But while OM, in the authoritarian style of the industrial giants of the past, instructed the nation to cut back on fat, the CM irregulars offered a personal service: just as mail-shots target particular postcodes, or loyalty cards enable supermarkets to track your personal spending patterns, so they could satisfy the Claras by tailoring a package for each one. \"Complementary medicine has definitely been piggy-backing on the rise of consumer power,\" says Andrew Vickers, author of the BMJ series and director of research at the Research Council for Complementary Medicine. \"People are changing the way they relate to authority figures. The doctor is there to serve you, just as banks and the phone service are.\" CM practitioners also tapped into one of the greatest sources of medical power since ancient times. Until five years ago, doctors had a lock on medical information. Even though your rash never seemed to clear up or your joints remained painfully stiff, the local doctor was the only one who could diagnose the problem and provide a remedy. That all changed with the advent of the internet. Suddenly, a wealth of information on every condition imaginable was just a few clicks of a mouse away. Within hours, if you were determined enough, you could know more than your GP about the causes of those blinding headaches and possible remedies. What's more, on the net, the divisions between orthodox and complementary vanish: every treatment is just one of dozens that come up in the window of your search engine. Of course, there are dangers, and misinformation is a problem, but OM's secret weapon, omniscience, had been disabled. The medical establishment has always liked to claim that its expertise is based on scientific evidence. Treatments are tested and based on the most rigorous research, so the story goes, while beyond their orthodoxy is the world of cranks and charlatans, making wild claims, relying on mere anecdote. \"The greatest appeal of complementary medicine is not scientific or practical,\" argues Marcia Agnell, editor of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine and a long-time opponent of alternative medicine. \"It is religious. Like most religions, it has charismatic personalities, who instead of doing research or publishing in scientific journals, promote their beliefs in books for the public, largely composed of inspirational testimonials.\" But the struggle between the establishment and the health irregulars has not just been a war of words. In the US, the Federal Drugs Administration (FDA) has a long history of taking legal action against those practising CM. In 1962, for instance, a Vermont grandmother was taken to court for selling yeast to pregnant women and making health claims for it in a leaflet. And in 1992, the consulting rooms of a nutritionist and doctor Jonathan Wright were raided by armed police officers and FDA officials who took away vitamin and mineral supplements. Others have been arrested while lecturing about vitamins, and nutritionists have been put under electronic surveillance. The FDA has also targeted alternative cancer treatments, while a Committee on Quackery, set up by the American Medical Association (AMA) in 1964, specifically denounced a form of spinal manipulation known as chiropractic. In 1987, a court found the AMA guilty of conspiring to destroy the profession of chiropractic. In Britain, an equally virulent campaign against CM practitioners has been conducted, largely through the media. It peaked about a decade ago when OM mounted what can now be seen as a desperate rearguard action. In 1989, the Campaign Against Health Fraud (CAHF), later renamed HealthWatch, was set up. Modelled on the self-styled \"quackbusters\" of the American National Council Against Health Fraud, its stated aim was to protect the sick and vulnerable from being exploited by ruthless quacks, peddling unproven and useless or dangerous cures. Its launch was marked by a newspaper article alleging, with no evidence, that \"a growing number of women were dying of breast cancer because they were putting themselves in the hands of quacks rather than orthodox specialists\". In his remarkably detailed book, Dirty Medicine, which exhaustively chronicles this time, Martin Walker claims that many of those involved in the campaign were linked in various ways with the large pharmaceutical and food companies, which had a vested interest in demolishing any alternative medical approaches that threatened their supremacy. Walker alleges that talk about scientific testing and rigour was actually a cloak for a far more commercial agenda. He shows how the most relentless rubbishing of alternatives - and the character-assassination of practitioners that went with it - occurred during the years that the Aids drug AZT was being trialled in the UK between the late 80s and 1992. The organisers of an Aids-information group, Positive Health, for instance, were attacked for \"exploiting people with Aids\". Their crime? Providing a forum to discuss orthodox and alternative treatments, and to organise workshops that taught basic meditation and provided information on diet and vitamins. At the same time, attempts by perfectly respectable scientists to set up proper trials of promising herbal or supplement-based Aids treatments were rejected out of hand. Perhaps the most compelling example that what was going on was not a battle between science and superstition, but one between establishment power and would-be reformers, is what happened to the Bristol Cancer Help Centre. Based on the idea that your best chance of living with, or even surviving, cancer lay with a healthy, effective immune system, the centre advocated an organic, largely vegetarian diet. By the mid-80s, it was confident enough to agree to a clinical trial of its effectiveness by the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. This looked like one of the few serious attempts to test an alternative approach, yet it proved to be the basis of yet another highly damaging and totally irresponsible assault. In 1990, with maximum publicity, the Lancet published some \"interim\" results, based on data from only 18 months of a study supposed to last five years. Its devastating conclusion was that women who had been treated with the Bristol Cancer Help Centre's diet were, in fact, twice as likely to die as those who received conventional treatment. The press had a field-day. Headlines such as \"Danger in a veggie cure for cancer\" and \"Double death risk at veg diet cancer clinic\" filled the papers. Over the succeeding weeks, it became clear that the interim report was seriously flawed. Nearly one-third of the patients classified as having been treated at Bristol had visited the centre only once and had not been on any special diet. Even the OM journal, Hospital Doctor, declared the study \"a fraud\". Eventually, the authors of the report themselves wrote to say they regretted \"that their paper created the impression that the Bristol regime worsened patients' chances\", but the damage had been done and the credibility of the centre was almost destroyed. The evidence is overwhelming that CAHF and its allies were not interested in exploring the scientific basis of such CM approaches as focusing on the role of food allergies in chronic disorders. A considerable body of respectable research supports this approach, known as clinical ecology. Yet the 1990 World In Action investigation into Breakspear Hospital, which specialised in allergies, ignored it all and instead concentrated on the cost of treatment and quoted OM experts who claimed the patients were deluded. The programme relied heavily on CAHF sources. The reaction of the patients involved in all this is very revealing. Instead of thanking the OM spokesmen for saving them from exploitation, in the wake of the attacks on both the Bristol Centre and Breakspear, they formed support committees and tried to get media coverage to put their side of the story. Aids activists forced many conventional doctors in the field to rethink the whole idea of clinical trials and this, too, was a major factor in CM's eventual success. It is against this background that the often-repeated charge that CM is potentially dangerous needs to be examined. Hardline medics regularly tar all CM treatments with the same sceptical brush. While some do require a leap of faith - personally, I find the use of crystals unbelievable, and many theories, such as the idea that high doses of vitamins C and E reduce the risk of strokes, are unproven - the evidence for others is increasingly impressive. It has been slow in coming, for reasons discussed below, but in clinical trials comparing drug and herb treatments, for instance, some herbs have been coming out on top. St John's Wort, for example, has been proven to be as good as pharmaceutical anti-depressants for mild depression - notwithstanding recent concern that there may be dangers in taking it in conjunction with conventional medicines; there is evidence that large doses of the mineral selenium can protect against cancer; and children brought up in a Rudolf Steiner vegetarian community, where they are not treated with drugs or vaccinated, had 40% fewer allergies. There is a strong whiff of hypocrisy in OM's assertion of high scientific principles: its own record of untested and dangerous treatment dwarfs anything achieved by CM. Indeed, according to Dr Ian Chalmers of the UK Cochrane Centre, set up to test medical procedures, about 60% of standard OM treatments have never been subject to proper trials. A dramatic example occurred in September last year, when it was revealed that the conventional treatment for patients with severe shock or burns - albumin - which has been used for the past 30 years, caused an estimated 1,200 extra deaths a year in the UK. An even more shocking departure from the gold standards of science was exposed in October 1999, when we learned of the problems that can follow from not publishing the negative results from clinical trials - a basic scientific requirement. According to Dr Chalmers, had the negative results on the heart drug lorcainide been published at the time, up to 80,000 deaths in the US in the 80s could have been prevented. Meanwhile, the CM camp is trying to establish firm evidence for its claim to treat successfully many of the chronic conditions - such as skin problems, auto-immune disorders and malfunctioning of the gut - with which OM seems to have a particularly poor track record. An estimated 4,000 randomised trials of CM treatments have been carried out, not all to a very high standard, but the number is doubling every five years and the design is improving. In the US, the National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, has a $50-million research budget and last year funded 43 studies, including one investigating the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating alcoholics and another on the value of melatonin in treating Parkinson's disease. There is a very good reason why CM is far more poorly researched than OM: money. The NHS spends roughly 85p on investigating CM for every \u00a3100 it spends on conventional medical research, while pharmaceu- tical companies, the other main source of funding, are not interested in testing the effectiveness of, say, garlic in cutting down heart disease or how diet can lower blood pressure, because they can't take out a patent on it. It is easy to see a conspiracy here, and it's true that, until CM began to gain popularity, the medical profession tended to the view that it was a waste of time to test its treatments. There is a deeper organisational problem, too. \"Unlike doctors in big NHS hospitals,\" says Andrew Vickers of the Research Council for Complementary Medicine, \"alternative practitioners have no research back up. In an NHS hospital, you have not only a ready supply of patients to put into trials, but also a department specifically devoted to research, with statisticians, secretaries, computers, photocopying and so on. So, even if the alternative practitioners do have the training and the inclination to write up research proposals and calculate the statistics, which most of them don't, they still face a big handicap.\" Despite these practical difficulties, a new style of medicine is emerging that aims to cherry-pick the best of both OM and CM. Dubbed integrated medicine, this is the CM practitioners' third name-change in as many decades, each reflecting a change in their status. During the wilderness years, they were alternative; then, as they won some recognition, they turned complementary; now, pushing for a merger, they've become integrated. \"Of course we need to run trials to find out what works best,\" says Dr Mosarif Ali, director of the Integrated Medical Centre in London, \"but we also need to reconnect medicine to its roots. The body is more than just a piece of bio-engineering, and there is more to healing than prescribing drugs.\" So at Ali's clinic, as in many others, you'll get antibiotics, if you really need them, but you'll also get a package of dietary changes, exercise, lifestyle advice and massage. \"Just that package alone clears up 80% of cases,\" Dr Ali claims. However, if it doesn't work on its own, you'll be offered a CM treatment that best fits you and your problem. \"If you had stomach pains,\" he says, \"you might be treated conventionally for a peptic ulcer, but an acupuncturist might treat you for 'deficient liver Qi' and a homoeopath for a 'pulsatilla constitution'.\" Like a medical Luther, Ali is calling for a return to the original medical text. Back to Hippocrates. \"He taught that doctors should fortify the body so that its natural healing power becomes more effective,\" he says. \"Modern medicine has been so blinded by powerful drugs, increasingly minute measurements of cell activity, enzyme levels and suchlike, that it has forgotten the basics.\" Only a few CM diehards would claim that the complementary approach is suitable for every condition. If you are in a car crash, you don't need aromatherapy or echinacea to boost your immune system; you need a casualty ward, heart monitors, anaesthetics and people with a good knowledge of blood chemistry. If your kidneys pack up, you need dialysis and a transplant, and if you develop meningitis, you need antibiotics, fast. But OM's very success - and scientific medicine is undoubtedly one of the triumphs of the past hundred years - can blind us to just what a new kid on the block it is. Just 60 years ago, before the second world war, doctors were pretty impotent. They could make a careful diagnosis and say what the likely outcome was, but, after that, nature was pretty much allowed to take her course.

Meanwhile, children died from diseases such as polio, diphtheria and whooping cough, and adults succumbed to various infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, or puerperal fever, which killed 1,000 women a year in childbirth. Then, within an astonishing 40 years - roughly between 1930 and 1970 - this bleak situation was transformed. Medical breakthroughs dating from that era include penicillin, pap smears for cervical cancer, kidney dialysis, general anaesthesia with curare, cortisone, a cure for tuberculosis, open heart surgery, polio vaccination, the contraceptive pill, hip replacement, kidney transplants, heart transplants and the cure of childhood cancer. \"Magic bullets came cascading out of the lab,\" writes medical journalist James Le Fanu in his recent book, The Rise And Fall Of Modern Medicine, that surveys this period. It was the very success of that revolution that created the conditions that allowed CM to flourish. For instance, two of the stars of those post-war breakthroughs - antibiotics and cortisone - have now come to symbolise much that is wrong with conventional medicine. Antibiotics were undoubtedly a miraculous discovery, vanquishing such major killers as septicaemia, meningitis and pneumonia, but their indiscriminate use and the rise of bacterial resistance has diminished their effectiveness.

Two more subtle changes at the heart of the scientific revolution have dramatically altered the way doctors think about patients and what treatments to use. Modern medicine rejected the notion that the doctor should be paramount in deciding how a patient should be treated, and instead turned to statistics. Statistical analysis of double blind trials is both the way to tell if a treatment works and to spot the causes of some diseases, such as the link between lung cancer and smoking.

The heroes of the age no longer just treated patients, they studied them to trace the variations in heart rhythms or to plot the chemical changes during liver failure. \"Patients became interesting clinical material,\" says Le Fanu, \"on which an ambitious young doctor could plan his experiments.\" As one doctor confesses: \"A lot of research you do is of no benefit to the patient, and there is a real possibility you can do them harm.\" Much of research undoubtedly paid of in new treatments, but a bond of trust was put in jeopardy, too. So it was that an entirely new approach to medicine - one that undoubtedly brought incalculable benefits in saving lives and reducing suffering - also alienated the doctors from their client base and created a vacuum at the heart of the profession that CM practitioners have now begun to fill. Will the gentle revolution of CM transform medicine as completely as the scientific revolution did half a century ago? For all its current popularity, its hold is far from secure. On the one hand, a counter-revolution from Europe, inhibiting CM, is a very real possibility. The British are allowed to take higher doses of vitamins and supplements than any other Europeans, and the EU has been pushing for standardised vitamin levels for many years - which would mean a big drop in the legal levels here. (This is what may have lain behind the puzzling and hugely controversial decision by the Labour government, soon after coming to power, to propose a ban on over-the-counter sales of vitamin B6 - commonly used to treat PMT - in doses higher than 10mg. The storm was such that the government backed down.) On the other hand, it is conceivable that the new genetics might eventually provide scientific medicine with the fresh supply of magic bullets that it has been promising: growing new personalised body parts, harvesting human antibodies from transgenic pigs, modifying mutated genes to cure disease, and so on. If it does live up to the hype, CM might be sidelined. Yet the deciphering of the human genome, promised for next year, has implications beyond new, improved drugs and surgery. Writer and genetic activist Jeremy Rifkin suggests that the new genetics has the potential to transform CM, too. Even the best run clinical trials of a drug or herb tell you that people in general get better with it, not whether it will benefit me rather than you. \"With a print-out of your genetic structure, medics will know the kind of diseases and disabilities you are susceptible to,\" says Rifkin. \"Now, suppose that we combine that information with all the new genetic knowledge about plants, and apply it to herbal therapies. We could begin to see exactly who would benefit from soy, who might be better helped with vitamin E and so on.\" Others have a less grandiose view: \"I don't think CM will have the impact of antibiotics or vaccination, which completely transformed medicine,\" says Vickers, \"but it could change the way doctors treat some patients. Many GP's regard CM as the perfect way to deal with 'heart-sink' patients - the ones who keep coming back with vague symptoms they can't do anything about. However, treating them with yoga or art therapy or singing can work wonders. Depending on your point of view, this is either simply the placebo effect at work, or it is a way of responding much more appropriately to the needs of the patient.\" CM could also help develop a hi-tech dimension. Already, the Americans are experimenting with herbal medicines in injectable form: electronic devices, as yet untested, that run weak electronic currents through the body, will, it is hoped, identify a broad spectrum of allergies, deficiencies and weaknesses by analysing the resulting wave forms. The internet will certainly play a much greater part in every sort of medicine, and CM practitioners are just as worried about the dissemination of misleading information as orthodox ones. \"We often have patients turning up with very dodgy supplements that they have found on the web,\" says Dr Rajendra Sharma of the 101 Practitioners Network. So he has raised \u00a317 million from the City to set up a website that he intends to be the definitive place to discover what integrated medicine treatment works best for what disorder. \"If you have a cold, you could discover that your first step should be echinacea or some other plant with anti-viral properties, such as pomegranate, plus vitamin C. Only much later, with bronchial complications, might you take antibiotics.\" For meningitis, meanwhile, you immediately need strong antibiotics, combined with probiotics, a supplement of the beneficial gut bacteria that are killed off by antibiotics, to protect the lining of the gut. For many practitioners, this coming-together of two strands of medicine can only be beneficial. \"We really need to get away from the commplementary-orthodox split,\" says Vickers. \"What everyone wants is a form of medicine that has trials showing that it works, that gives practitioners a code of conduct and that allows patients choice and respect.\" Medicine is both an art and a science, but science has been firmly in the driving seat for 40 years. The arrival of CM practitioners may allow some of the more intangible aspects of the healing profession to re-emerge into the light, such as the power of the doctor's own belief. \"When I was starting out as a doctor, my professor told me about a new migraine drug,\" recalls Marshall Marinker, professor of general practice at the University of London. \"I prescribed it to a number of my patients, and it worked brilliantly. Many were completely cured. But then I began thinking about its mechanisms and how to design a trial, and it somehow stopped working so well. I never again got such good results as when I totally believed in it. I don't think you can measure that sort of thing in clinical trials, but it is absolutely vital to the way medicine should work.\"",

Let's take the example of poppies: it may be, say, from T&amp;M's 'Angels' Choir' strain, or the ladybird poppy, Papaver commutatum ; or it might be one of the equally fragile poppy tribe, such as eschscholzias, the Califor-nian poppies; or hunnemannia, the gloriously yellow tulip poppy with glaucous foliage; or argemone, the prickly poppies, yellow or white; or the charming little cream cups, Platystemon californicus . You could sow now, very thinly, into a number of modules, reducing the seedlings to one in each as soon as they show themselves. Then, when large enough, move them without any need for disturbance into 7cm or 9cm pots, planting out from those. Alternatively, you could, say at the end of March, sow a batch of seeds, thinly, into one pot and prick out seedlings individually into modules as soon as you can handle them. When large enough and hardened off, they can be planted out.</p> <p>I keep emphasising the importance of sowing thinly. There is no temptation to do otherwise, if you start off with only a few seeds, but there is a temptation to sow too thickly, which will make the seedlings harder to separate when the time comes to handle them individually - this is especially so with poppies, whose seeds are tiny, campanulas, whose seeds are tinier still, and begonias, whose seeds are tiniest of all. If there are more seeds in a packet than you immediately need, keep them by you and don't just sow them because they're there.</p> <p>Should your seeds be germinated in darkness or in light? The advantage of sowing them in darkness is that their compost is more easily prevented from drying out. But, if they germinate and do not then immediately have their wraps removed, the seedlings will become long and lanky, which is just what you least want and always indicates a shortage of light or space just when they most need it.</p> <p>The other point is that many seeds actually need some light in order to germinate at all. They don't need a great deal, so one compromise that works is to germinate them under close conditions (ie, under unventilated glass) and to cover the containers with brown paper, which will keep out direct sunlight but will not impose total darkness. Or, if only a few pots are in question, you could tightly cover each with a plastic bag and forget about darkness altogether. But do avoid direct sunlight.</p> <p>Still, it helps if there is sunshine to keep things snug, and, from March onwards, few seeds actually need artificial heat in order to germinate. It isn't that you want to whip up daytime temperatures to a high level with the help of the sun. That's easily done, and isn't clever if sunshine is then followed by a cold night and none of the sun's heat is retained where the seeds are, so think about insulation that will retain daytime heat into the night - for instance, a frame or greenhouse with solid walls rather than glass at the sides as well as over the top.

I'd had to abort two attempts to get to Chapter II in Blackheath, south-east London, and there I was again, waiting for Rowbotham, and not a sign of her, and time getting on. Then Rowbotham turned up and we got stuck in glutinous traffic around the Elephant &amp; Castle. And then in even worse traffic further on, and I was losing my temper and despairing of ever getting anywhere ever again, let alone to Blackheath, and Rowbotham was busy telling me not to be so cantankerous and that there were worse things in life and that I shouldn't be having a panic attack just because I might miss a meal, which wouldn't do me any harm, anyway, and I said - well, I won't tell you what I said because, looking back, it didn't show me up in a particularly good light.</p> <p>But we did get to Blackheath, and not too late, either, and there was Chapter II in a little terrace of shops sloping at 45 degrees just down from the heath, shining like a beacon on a dank night, styling itself as a \"Modern European Restaurant\". For a moment, I was tempted to debate the Empsonian ambiguity of this description - that is, whether this meant that Chapter II was a restaurant for a modern Europe or a modern restaurant that happened to be in Europe or a modern restaurant in a modern Europe, or what - but Rowbotham did not share my grammatical obsessions, having become very keen to get among the vittels.</p> <p>Anyway, I knew full well what Chapter II meant by those words. Rather like Parade, which I reviewed last week, it is thoroughly contemporary in all its parts: bleached-pine flooring, cool wall shades, chromatically florid pics, chairs in primary colours, inset spotlights in the ceiling, small flower displays, busy waiters with gelled hair, all brisk, bright, smiling, and sophisticated - ish. In other words, tailored to today's expectations for a neighbourhood restaurant, of a piece with power-suiting, snatched lunches, mobile phones and no time for home cooking.</p> <p>The menu pretty much keeps pace, what with grilled sole with lentil-and-coriander broth; deep-fried saltcod, garlic mash and roast red peppers; fricas\u00e9e of chicken, peas and morels with tarragon cream; roast peach, rice pudding and white-chocolate cheesecake. On second thoughts, that last panders more to the traditional British appetite for pudding overkill. And there are other signs of a recidivist, gutsier sensibility at work, what with duck-and-black-pudding faggot with split peas and apple sauce, and slow-cooked lamb with cassoulet. Perhaps this isn't that surprising, as the chef, Adrian Jones, has rubbed chef's jackets with, among others, Shaun Hill and Gary Rhodes - both smart exponents of highly-flavoured cooking that places Britain firmly at the centre of Europe.</p> <p>You can probably guess which dishes I fancied. Yes, the faggot and the lamb with cassoulet, but I separated them with a dish of warm skate and crab with parsley salad, having decided to pass when the time came for pudding. Chapter II operates a reasonable policy of two courses for \u00a316.50, three for \u00a319.50, which for dinner-pricing in or near the capital verges on the charitable. Rowbotham, being a lightly conventional person, went lightly conventionally for lobster fritter with spiced cucumber, then grilled sea bass with olive-oil mash and black-olive-and-onion tart, and champagne sorbet with caramel orange to clear the decks at the end of the engagement.</p> <p>Well, first the high points: the faggot - juicy, potent without the slight rank quality that long-cooked liver can give the normal version; its bouncy succulence was nicely matched by the grainy split pea, Britain's answer to the lentil (and rather more interesting); the skate - beautifully cooked, with a gentle sweetness, and the brilliant, chlorophyll-packed parsley salad; the airy lobster fritter - a rich, light, creamy shellfish mousse inside a thin, crisp cocoon, nicely offset by the stack of lightly pickled, seductively floppy discs of cucumber. All this was distinctly above average, highly pleasing tucker.</p> <p>Highish points: the grilled sea bass - technically very well cooked; the olive-and-onion tart - ditto; and the slow-cooked lamb (shank), which was rich, melting and palliative. Not so high points: the crab quenelle - on top of the skate, it seemed rather tired, compared with the vibrant quality of the rest of the dish; the over-sweet, over-tomatoed, uninspired beans (\"cassoulet garnish\"); the olive-oil mash - okay, but a bit of a standard issue item; and the champagne sorbet - very sweet.</p> <p>So that was \u00a339 (\u00a319.50 for three courses times two) plus a \u00a31 supplement on the skate salad (for the crab, I would guess). So how the devil did we end up with a bill for \u00a396.65? Well, by that time, we'd had two glasses of champagne (\u00a311.90), a bottle of chirpy pinot grigio (\u00a327.50), half a bottle of decentish claret and \u00a32.75 for water. On that basis, you can conclude that Rowbotham and I had an agreeable evening (she more than I, for I was driving), and that Chapter II lives up to its claim to produce decent food at decent prices, and all that.</p> <p>Actually, the food is better than decent. It has real spirit. It even put the hellish trip out there into perspective. Why, in retrospect, even being stuck in traffic at the Elephant &amp; Castle seemed nothing more than a sharpening of anticipation</p>",

The menu pretty much keeps pace, what with grilled sole with lentil-and-coriander broth; deep-fried saltcod, garlic mash and roast red peppers; fricas\u00e9e of chicken, peas and morels with tarragon cream; roast peach, rice pudding and white-chocolate cheesecake. On second thoughts, that last panders more to the traditional British appetite for pudding overkill. And there are other signs of a recidivist, gutsier sensibility at work, what with duck-and-black-pudding faggot with split peas and apple sauce, and slow-cooked lamb with cassoulet. Perhaps this isn't that surprising, as the chef, Adrian Jones, has rubbed chef's jackets with, among others, Shaun Hill and Gary Rhodes - both smart exponents of highly-flavoured cooking that places Britain firmly at the centre of Europe. You can probably guess which dishes I fancied. Yes, the faggot and the lamb with cassoulet, but I separated them with a dish of warm skate and crab with parsley salad, having decided to pass when the time came for pudding. Chapter II operates a reasonable policy of two courses for \u00a316.50, three for \u00a319.50, which for dinner-pricing in or near the capital verges on the charitable. Rowbotham, being a lightly conventional person, went lightly conventionally for lobster fritter with spiced cucumber, then grilled sea bass with olive-oil mash and black-olive-and-onion tart, and champagne sorbet with caramel orange to clear the decks at the end of the engagement. Well, first the high points: the faggot - juicy, potent without the slight rank quality that long-cooked liver can give the normal version; its bouncy succulence was nicely matched by the grainy split pea, Britain's answer to the lentil (and rather more interesting); the skate - beautifully cooked, with a gentle sweetness, and the brilliant, chlorophyll-packed parsley salad; the airy lobster fritter - a rich, light, creamy shellfish mousse inside a thin, crisp cocoon, nicely offset by the stack of lightly pickled, seductively floppy discs of cucumber. All this was distinctly above average, highly pleasing tucker. Highish points: the grilled sea bass - technically very well cooked; the olive-and-onion tart - ditto; and the slow-cooked lamb (shank), which was rich, melting and palliative. Not so high points: the crab quenelle - on top of the skate, it seemed rather tired, compared with the vibrant quality of the rest of the dish; the over-sweet, over-tomatoed, uninspired beans (\"cassoulet garnish\"); the olive-oil mash - okay, but a bit of a standard issue item; and the champagne sorbet - very sweet. So that was \u00a339 (\u00a319.50 for three courses times two) plus a \u00a31 supplement on the skate salad (for the crab, I would guess). So how the devil did we end up with a bill for \u00a396.65? Well, by that time, we'd had two glasses of champagne (\u00a311.90), a bottle of chirpy pinot grigio (\u00a327.50), half a bottle of decentish claret and \u00a32.75 for water. On that basis, you can conclude that Rowbotham and I had an agreeable evening (she more than I, for I was driving), and that Chapter II lives up to its claim to produce decent food at decent prices, and all that. Actually, the food is better than decent. It has real spirit. It even put the hellish trip out there into perspective. Why, in retrospect, even being stuck in traffic at the Elephant &amp; Castle seemed nothing more than a sharpening of anticipation",

All of the eight Tesco wines below are on offer, at the prices stated, until March 7, when, I trust, the first faint signs of spring should creep over the southern portion of these islands. Tesco's South African Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 1996 (15 points, out of 20) has been featured here before, but it cost \u00a34.99 then. Now, it's \u00a31 less. Not enough to win it Weightwatcher of the Year, but good enough to rate 15.5 points at that price, because it is engagingly well flavoured - dry, characterful, richly styled yet controlled - and excellent with food. Undurraga Pinot Noir 1998 (14.5 points, down to \u00a33.99), from Chile, is hardly classic pinot, but it is immensely drinkable with its cherry, plum and blackberry ripe fruit. From Argentina, there is the non-vintage Chimango Tempranillo Malbec (14 points, nigh rock bottom at \u00a32.99), a straightforward construct: fruity and rich, and as simple and vulgar as David Beckham, though not so mixed-up. Chilean Merlot Reserve 1998 (16 points, reduced to \u00a34.49) shows the lovely subtle sweetness of young merlot, gentle yet gripping tannins, and well-developed, balanced fruit of some energy. Domaine de la Grande Bellane Valreas 1998 (15.5 points) is an organic red on offer at \u00a34.99. Brusque to begin, it develops lovely flowing plums, cherries and blackberries, and finishes with a savoury/sweet tang. </p> <p>Arniston Bay Chenin Chardonnay 1998 (15.5 points, down to \u00a33.49) is extremely forward, but not flashy. It has warmth and piles of soft fruit, yet manages to stay refreshing and engagingly plump without being obscenely Rubenesque. Tesco's own-label Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon 1997 (16 points, reduced to \u00a35.99) elegantly demonstrates that this Australian region is uniquely capable of turning out finely textured, gently minty/spicy, very fine reds. Last at Tesco, there is the Ros\u00e9 Cava, a Spanish bubbly that, rating 15.5 points, has been slashed to \u00a33.99. Deliciously dry and gently fruity, this sassy specimen is - if you'll forgive me - a fab bubbly for a bleak Feb. It makes many a much-vaunted Champagne blush to be so much more expensive but no more classy. </p> <p>Sainsbury's has three, non-discounted reds worth the detour. They are Nero d'Avola Connubio 1998 (15.5 points, \u00a34.99) and Zagara Nero d'Avola &amp; Sangiovese 1998 (15.5 points, \u00a33.99), from Italy, and Ch\u00e2teau Agram Corbi\u00e8res 1996 (15.5 points, \u00a33.99). The first offers up a leather-and-tobacco aroma, the tobacco edge carrying through to the very dry fruit that has a faint echo of dried figs - an unusually characterful, sturdy wine. The second unites lovely rich tannins with juicy, medium-paced fruit, and it's generous and firm. The French wine, number three, is remarkable value, offering, as it does, highly civilised, Midi-typical quaffing with gentility and warmth, and soft restraint on the finish.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Awake from terrifying dream that my cup of tea was haunted. You could see by the way the surface heaved and rippled that it was possessed by the Devil. Not so much PG Tips: more 18 and Over. Heave myself out of bed, recalling wise words of internet astrologer, Lorelei Dove: \"There is nothing to fear but fear itself.\" Gaze into bathroom mirror and discover that I, too, am possessed by the Devil.</p> <p>I have started to resemble Cliff Richard - although I look slightly more masculine and a great deal more elderly. Just another of the Devil's little jokes.</p> <p>Someone hammers on the bathroom door - it is Satan's representative on earth, ex-Spouse. \"I want a bath,\" he growls. \"If it's not too much to ask.\" He is supposed to live downstairs with his own en-suite shower. \"Your shower would be a lot more environmentally-friendly,\" I scold. Sod that, is the reply. Ex-Spouse is reading the anti-eco-Bible, Hard Green. Yesterday, he informed me that he will never recycle anything again. \"Not even clapped-out old ex-wives?\" I quipped - tastelessly, no doubt. Anyway, as far as the environment is concerned, he has informed me we should leave it all to the rich countries and market forces.</p> <p>Admit ex-Spouse into bathroom. We are a post-modern, post-Eros family. He doesn't even glance sideways at my cute old bottom as he runs his bath. \"I've just been listening to Aunt Elspeth drivelling on,\" he snarls, as if she is some impediment to his liberty and happiness and not our generous benefactor. \"She's in love. She's met some geezer down that OAPs' Club.\" Aunt has been attending an upmarket social club for seniors. No bingo. Instead, whist, tea-dances and coach trips to Stourhead. \"He's called Alec.\" Do not like the name Alec. Too phalec.</p> <p>\"Apparently, he executes a mean foxtrot and hails from Stoke Poges.\" Leave ex-Spouse to wallow in his bath. Hope great-aunt will not go all the way on her first date. And it was Harriet I was worried about.</p> <p>Post arrives - lasagne of horrifying bills. What will happen if aunt decides to cohabit with Alec and takes her liquidity with her? Run upstairs and burst into bathroom. \"Why don't you get up off your arse and earn a few quid?\" I yell. \"Why don't you ?\" is the reply. Decide I bloody well will, then, but first consult internet astrologer, Lorelei: \"Today, you might meet a dark stranger, who will ask you a challenging question, Virgo,\" she warns. So I might even get as far as an interview? Encouraged, I rush out, exhilarated by the possibility of a new life stacking shelves in Tesco's or being a dinnerlady (now a glamorous career option, thanks to Victoria Wood.) Yes! This is the first day of the rest of my life. If an opportunity arises, I shall seize it with gusto.</p> <p>Trot off towards Tesco's. Something reassuring about pavements. Town. Comforting cafes. Moving back to town is back to the womb. Behind Tesco's, I stumble upon ancient church tucked away among evergreens. Enjoy box pews, splendid misericords and emerge into sunshine and settle down on bench with all the satisfaction that comes from a bloody good font. Bit of a sun-trap, so shut eyes and bask.</p> <p>Hear a footstep. Young man looking like El Greco saint enters church. The organist, perhaps, going in to practise. Maybe I'll be treated to a recital. Close eyes again and wait for Bach.

      "bodyText": "Awake from terrifying dream that my cup of tea was haunted. You could see by the way the surface heaved and rippled that it was possessed by the Devil. Not so much PG Tips: more 18 and Over. Heave myself out of bed, recalling wise words of internet astrologer, Lorelei Dove: \"There is nothing to fear but fear itself.\" Gaze into bathroom mirror and discover that I, too, am possessed by the Devil. I have started to resemble Cliff Richard - although I look slightly more masculine and a great deal more elderly. Just another of the Devil's little jokes. Someone hammers on the bathroom door - it is Satan's representative on earth, ex-Spouse. \"I want a bath,\" he growls. \"If it's not too much to ask.\" He is supposed to live downstairs with his own en-suite shower. \"Your shower would be a lot more environmentally-friendly,\" I scold. Sod that, is the reply. Ex-Spouse is reading the anti-eco-Bible, Hard Green. Yesterday, he informed me that he will never recycle anything again. \"Not even clapped-out old ex-wives?\" I quipped - tastelessly, no doubt. Anyway, as far as the environment is concerned, he has informed me we should leave it all to the rich countries and market forces. Admit ex-Spouse into bathroom. We are a post-modern, post-Eros family. He doesn't even glance sideways at my cute old bottom as he runs his bath. \"I've just been listening to Aunt Elspeth drivelling on,\" he snarls, as if she is some impediment to his liberty and happiness and not our generous benefactor. \"She's in love. She's met some geezer down that OAPs' Club.\" Aunt has been attending an upmarket social club for seniors. No bingo. Instead, whist, tea-dances and coach trips to Stourhead. \"He's called Alec.\" Do not like the name Alec. Too phalec. \"Apparently, he executes a mean foxtrot and hails from Stoke Poges.\" Leave ex-Spouse to wallow in his bath. Hope great-aunt will not go all the way on her first date. And it was Harriet I was worried about. Post arrives - lasagne of horrifying bills. What will happen if aunt decides to cohabit with Alec and takes her liquidity with her? Run upstairs and burst into bathroom. \"Why don't you get up off your arse and earn a few quid?\" I yell. \"Why don't you ?\" is the reply. Decide I bloody well will, then, but first consult internet astrologer, Lorelei: \"Today, you might meet a dark stranger, who will ask you a challenging question, Virgo,\" she warns. So I might even get as far as an interview? Encouraged, I rush out, exhilarated by the possibility of a new life stacking shelves in Tesco's or being a dinnerlady (now a glamorous career option, thanks to Victoria Wood.) Yes! This is the first day of the rest of my life. If an opportunity arises, I shall seize it with gusto. Trot off towards Tesco's. Something reassuring about pavements. Town. Comforting cafes. Moving back to town is back to the womb. Behind Tesco's, I stumble upon ancient church tucked away among evergreens. Enjoy box pews, splendid misericords and emerge into sunshine and settle down on bench with all the satisfaction that comes from a bloody good font. Bit of a sun-trap, so shut eyes and bask. Hear a footstep. Young man looking like El Greco saint enters church. The organist, perhaps, going in to practise. Maybe I'll be treated to a recital. Close eyes again and wait for Bach. Ten minutes later, footsteps echo again, approach, and voice demands, \"What d'you think of that, then?\" Open eyes to discover that saintly young man has returned and is standing before me engaged in a rather more profane kind of organ recital than I had anticipated. Leap up and run off, as I have never regarded masturbation as a spectator sport - although when the Devil finally takes over the world from his HQ in Croydon, perhaps it will find a niche among the domestic competitions such as darts and snooker. \"Did you find a job, then?\" enquires ex-Spouse, looking up from his newspaper. Inform him that instead I was a victim of sexual harassment. \"Oh well,\" he yawns, \"I suppose it's a step in the right direction.\"",

      "body": "<b>Arthur and Margaret Wynn, dietary experts</b> <br> Arthur and Margaret Wynn published their most recent scientific paper last week, 30 years after they started writing about maternal nutrition, and a little less than a month after Arthur's 90th birthday; Margaret is 86. \"We've been married for 61 years,\" she said. \"Beat that!\" The only palpably old-fashioned thing about them is their belief in government as an engine of progress, where people should be concerned about the welfare of even the poorest. <p>The centrepiece of their research is the belief that a mother's diet has most effect on her baby's health not during pregnancy, but around the time of conception.

The centrepiece of their research is the belief that a mother's diet has most effect on her baby's health not during pregnancy, but around the time of conception. It is not controversial that low birthweight is bad for babies; but using statistics on poverty and famine in Europe, going back as far as 1848 in Paris, they believe they have established that the crucial factor is bad or inadequate food around the time of conception.

Electronics engineer Michael John Smith, who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for spying, is fighting for the right to contact the press from prison. Mr Justice Jackson, sitting in open court in London, gave Smith, 51, the go-ahead to seek a judicial review against the ministry of defence at a hearing which will probably take place in secret. He said the MoD had taken an \"eminently sensible\" decision not to oppose a full hearing at yesterday's preliminary stage, when Smith only had to establish that he had \"an arguable case\". The judge added that he had read the documents and concluded \"there are matters which require to be properly argued\" at a full hearing. A long-term Communist, Smith was jailed for 25 years in November 1993 for selling military secrets about radar systems to the former Soviet Union between 1990-92 while he was working for the GEC group. He was said to have been paid \u00a320,000. His sentence was reduced on appeal in June 1995 to 20 years. The crown could not prove during his nine-week trial exactly what material Smith, a quality assurance audit manager, had given away. But at the time of his arrest his car contained documents relating to radar for the Rapier missile system and military surface acoustic wave radar technology, which scientific experts agreed at his trial might be of use to the Russians. In 1995 the security com mission criticised MI5 and the MoD, saying the handling of Smith from a security viewpoint was characterised by delays and errors and incorrect judgments. Yesterday, Mr Justice Jackson ordered that the court file for the pending high court challenge \"be held in secure conditions\" by the treasury solicitor. He also ordered that Smith should not reveal to anyone the material filed by him, or the MoD, for use in the proceedings. The full hearing should be heard in camera, subject to any contrary order of the court, said the judge.",

      "bodyText": "A famous infertility expert may be forced to pay his former university employers hundreds of thousands of pounds after a high court judge ruled he had profited from a private practice using the university's staff. Simon Fishel, an embryologist who pioneered treatment for infertile couples, ran clinics abroad which brought in fees from patients of up to \u00a310,000 each. His former employers, Nottingham university, sued him for \"secret profits\" reaped while he was a university employee after he had later left to set up a rival clinic. But the court case is expected to leave an even bigger hole in the finances of the university, which is thought to have spent over \u00a3500,000 pursuing Dr Fishel, who mortgaged his farmhouse at East Bridgford, Notts, to fight the case. The university, which sued Dr Fishel for \u00a3400,000, succeeded on only part of its claim. Mr Justice Elias ruled that Dr Fishel had breached his employment contract in failing to secure permission to carry out infertility treatments in Italy, South Africa and the Middle East, but awarded no damages to the university. The judge decided that Dr Fishel, who was scientific di rector of the university's Nurture clinic, had breached his duty to the university in using its staff embryologists to carry out treatments. He had to pay the university the profits he made from supervising their work. But a claim for the profits from Dr Fishel's own work was rejected. A separate hearing will quantify the sums involved, but the judge said Dr Fishel could offset the payments he had made to the embryologists and the tax he had paid on the profit. Dr Fishel said yesterday that he believed the final figure would be less than \u00a375,000. A future hearing will decide how much he will have to pay to the university in profits. A judge will also have to decide how the huge costs of the hearing should be split, since neither side won a clear-cut victory. After the judgment, Dr Fishel, 47, called on the higher education funding council to launch an inquiry \"so that the council at Nottingham and at other universities can learn the lessons from this case and never waste public money again\". He said he had made several attempts to reach a settlement with the university and provided full details of his assets and income so the university could see the costs being built up were beyond his means. Keith Jones, the university registrar, rejected suggestions by the infertility expert that he had not made much money from his private ventures. The judge accepted that Dr Fishel had benefited the university through the knowledge he and his colleagues gained by using techniques abroad which were not permitted by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority in Britain. Despite Dr Fishel's salary - \u00a3138,000 in 1996 - Mr Justice Elias was told he charged patients for treatment at foreign clinics and kept the money for himself and to pay the Nurture embryologists and other staff. His profit-making business used the Nurture name and the university's employees, secretarial facilities, fax machine, computers, paper and equipment, the judge was told. The judge said he was satisfied that Dr Fishel's trips abroad did not prejudice the university clinic or lead to a reduction in the number of patients. Mr Justice Elias said Dr Fishel did not make \"secret profits\" as alleged by the university because the outside bodies were employing him not as a university employee but because of his reputation. But the judge said Dr Fishel's use of university embryologists in his work abroad was making use of his position to \"further his own interests\" and there had been no consent for this from his superiors.",

      "bodyText": "It might be a crucial rugby match between two fierce opponents, but once the referee blows the whistle to let battle commence it could be described as a case of keeping up with the Joneses. When the Bala rugby club takes to the field against Fairwater today, it promises to be every commentator's and referee's nightmare with no fewer than 10 of their 15 players starting the match all called Jones, and with another two players bearing the same surname sitting on the subsitutues bench. All seven Bala backs are called Jones. To make matters even more complicated, their opponents have four Morgans. Dilwyn Morgan, a Bala second-row player, said: \"There are so many Joneses it gets us confused, so we have nicknames. It's a common name around here, but it's still unusual to have so many in one side.\" The Worthington Welsh districts quater-final match will take place in Cardiff and the referee has been warned that he might have a few problems once he has seen the team sheet. Ray Hobby, treasurer of Fairwater rugby club, said he was amazed when he was sent the team sheet. \"The 12 Joneses are all listed together and our programme could become something of a collector's item. I never known some many Joneses to be in the same team..\" The competition, for lower league Welsh rugby teams, culminates with a final at Cardiff's newly built Millennium Stadium.",

Clare Hollingworth, the Guardian's former defence correspondent, won the lifetime achievement award. The judges said Foot had always stuck to his principles \"and to the chagrin of the authorities has been proved right time and time again\". They cited investigations into the Hanratty case, the Bridgewater three, arms to Iraq and the Archer and Aitken stories as examples of his tenacity. They went on: \"At the end of the 90s we look back and see how many times Paul Foot's campaigns have made a difference. His persistence is a lesson to all journalists.\"",

The cost of the clean-up and disposal of the radioactive waste is expected to exceed \u00a3250,000, the agency said. The former director, who had operated from premises in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, was found guilty under the radioactive substances act at Hemel Hempstead magistrates court last November. The agency said Ms Seward had arranged for over half a tonne of depleted uranium waste to be secretly removed from company premises and illegally disposed of in 1993 after both firms had ceased trading. An investigation launched in 1994 after several kilos of the toxic waste were discovered at a scrapyard in Sheffield led to the discovery of several hundred kilos at Poplar's Farm, Chelveston, Northamptonshire.

      "bodyText": "The City's top regulator yesterday warned mortgage companies that they are lending homebuyers too much money, raising fears of a rerun of the early 1990s repossession crisis. Against a backdrop of national house price rises of 16%, the Financial Services Authority has found \"worrying signs\" that mortgage lenders - who between them are owed nearly \u00a3450bn - are adopting laxer lending policies than in recent years. After scrutinising the loans granted by nine of the biggest mortgage lenders, Howard Davies, chairman of the FSA, urged lenders to be more cautious when making loans to home buyers. While making it clear the market did not yet resemble the late 1980s and early 1990s, when thousands of people faced having their homes repossessed, Mr Davies was clearly concerned about mortgage market lending trends. In a speech to the country's major lenders yesterday, he \"strongly counselled prudence and called on lenders to review their lending practices\". At the annual Council of Mortgage Lenders lunch he also issued a warning to house buyers that they could no longer rely on house inflation to reduce their debts. Mr Davies' comments carry extra weight if, as is expected, the FSA takes over the regulation of the mortgage market. He sounded the alarm bells after an FSA survey of the nine major lenders, who between them account for 54% of the mortgage market. The survey found they were giving loans to customers at increasing greater multiples of their salaries. At the same time, they were offering borrowers loans against a greater proportion of their new homes than in past. This was causing the regulator increasing concern in an environment where house buyers also owe a record \u00a383bn of money on an increasing amount of \"non mort gage\" debt, for instance on car loans. Mr Davies urged mortgage lenders, who have all introduced more flexible products for borrowers, not to let \"the hard learned lessons of the last recession to recede from corporate memories\". His comments come at time of heated debated in the City about the speed at which the Bank of England will raise interest rates this year. Rates could rise from the current 6% to just 7.5% - still well below the double figures inflicted on lenders at the height of the last housing boom. That could take mortgage rates to above 9% from today's standard variable rate of 7.9%, causing hardship to first time buyers and other homeowners who have taken on large mortgages. However, commentators say that in real terms, with inflation just 2%, the impact of mortgage rates could be just as painful for some borrowers. The housing market itself is also patchy, with hotspots such as London leaping 25- 30% despite the 16% average. The FSA survey found that homebuyers are being offered loans worth 3.5 to 3.75 times their income, compared with 3 to 3.25 before the boom. It also found that one in eight loans are for more than 95% of the value of a house, which means lenders are suffering higher risk on their mortgage books which could take five years to recede. Mr Davies called on lenders to make their products simpler and eradicate difficult conditions such as tie-ins and redemption penalties. \"It is in all our interests to clear up in those areas and to ensure that borrowers know what they are getting into,\" he said. Halifax, Abbey National and Nationwide, the big three lenders, all insist that their average maximum lending percentages have been static or falling over the last year.

      "body": "<p>In the coming weeks, crowds in London will gasp at the skills of a solo performer who takes more risks than a dome aerialist, does slicker routines than a Fosse hoofer, and cracks more gags than Bob Monkhouse. Enter the official Conservative challenger to become the capital's first elected mayor: Steven Norris.</p> <p>To secure the nomination, Norris has had to demonstrate wondrous powers. First he was defeated by Jeffrey Archer, but re-entered the contest after his main rival was disgraced. Having jumped head first through blazing hoops held by his opponents to get back on the shortlist, he was vanquished a second time when his former constituency denounced him as a liability in a letter to party activists. But eventually he got the nomination, while Archer was banished to the wilderness.</p> <p>For both main political parties, the business of choosing a mayoral runner has been a murky one. Since Labour announced the result of its ballot, it has had to endure a week of farcical knock-about between Frank Dobson and Ken Livingstone, which hasn't done Norris's chances any harm at all.</p> <p>So is Norris gloating at all this? \"I've just been trying to wipe the grin off my face and not intrude on private grief,\" he says. The grin, though, is a wry one, for Norris had a spot of bother with the selection process himself, since both he and Archer had embarrassing histories. Archer differed from him in that he was as famous for concealing his past as Norris was for letting his be paraded publicly. Just before the Daily Mail began serialising Changing Trains, the auto-biography of the former minister and serial philanderer four years ago, Norris was interviewed over lunch by the Mail's doyenne, Lynda Lee-Potter. The resulting piece was a curtain-raiser for the book's spicy tales - \"How the Tory toffs destroyed Thatcher\"; \"Why I threw darts at Heseltine's poster\"; and \"My brief fumble that so excited Edwina Currie\".</p> <p>At the time Norris was on the road to oblivion. He'd given up his career at Westminster; his finances were a shambles; he was separated from his wife. In short, he was a politician who'd been famous for five minutes - and for five mistresses. That might have been unfair, but the public were more likely to remember his amatory exploits and his penchant for making ill-advised quips than for anything he'd achieved in almost five years as minister in charge of transport in London.</p> <p>True to form, that Mail interview ended with Norris remarking that, as he hadn't been recognised by anyone at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington during lunch, \"if I ever was to have another affair, this would be the place to come\". Norris claims he did not say it, that the theoretical possibility of the hotel as a trysting place was put to him by Lee-Potter, and, in a tone of strained politeness at a tasteless remark, he gritted his teeth and said \"Er, yeeeess\".</p> <p>Poor Steven Norris; once you've got a reputation for a tearaway tongue, it's hard to plead innocence even if someone's put words into your mouth. Once, as transport minister, he said he preferred cars to buses, because public transport meant sitting alongside awful people (but the irony was lost on the tabloids). As an MP, he joked that his Epping constituency had fallen off the back of a lorry (luckily Essex voters have a sense of humour). And when, in 1995, he was asked on TV why he was voting for John \"back me or sack me\" Major in the leadership election, he famously replied, \"Because he's far and away the least worst option\" (a backhanded compliment that could have meant the chop if the PM had been vengeful).</p> <p>Mixed blessings don't come any bigger than Norris. If he's elected on May 4, Londoners will get a can-do but gaffe-prone mayor. Hague and the shadow cabinet will have the bittersweet experience of seeing a Tory conquering a major political bastion - but a Tory prepared to do business with Blair plc. And Labour will find that, while Norris is far from the stroppiest Tory around, he's a skilled opponent.</p> <p>One or two ancestral Tory snobs sneer that there's a touch of the forecourt about him (referring to his former lucrative motor dealerships), when clearly they'd prefer a touch of the forelock. And it is said that Norris can be a bit of a maverick. However, distinguished greyheads who've worked with him know nothing of these heresies and, while they don't overdo the praise, they allow that he does have good points.</p> <p>Lord (Kenneth) Baker, the former home secretary, says his former PPS is a superb communicator who can create the aura of confidence that will be needed by the capital's boss. \"He's a wonderful spokesman for London. Just right for the job, which is about presentation more than anything else.\" And Sir Brian Mawhinney, the former transport supremo, who had Norris as a junior minister, says he's never worked with anyone more know-ledgeable on London's transport. Mawhinney reckons that his three-year absence from politics is a plus, not a minus, because it will have refreshed his thinking.</p> <p>But what about those mistresses, whose existence incited four members of Norris's former Epping constituency to attempt to sabotage his mayoral chances with a letter denouncing him for having given a false picture of his marriage as stable? Lord Baker cites historic precedents of politicians who have taken a mistress and survived, and dismisses it as a foible. Mawhinney says: \"Steve has set out his private life in what seems a pretty open way to me. Londoners will judge him in the round.\"</p> <p>And, indeed, it's Norris's emollient side that's on display now. He says he'll write his own manifesto, but will get both the shadow cabinet and Tories standing as assembly members to approve it.Labour, of course, would find it a pleasure to do business with him compared with Ken Livingstone.</p> <p>\"People say I get on well with Labour because I'm not greatly detained by the theology of politics,\" says Norris. \"I really am the ultimate pragmatist who wants to do things. Mr Blair and I are not going to fall out about yellow box junction management. On which, as far as I know, neither Marx nor Lenin had much of an opinion. Even Adam Smith is pretty vague on this subject.\" Norris smiles as he delivers another perfect sound-bite. He's a big man - a bit below the 17 stones he peaked at last year; he's lost the rather nerdish look he used to have - the shiny slick of hair; the slightly pinched features. Now, at 55, he looks relaxed and confident enough to jolly a frustrated crowd of tube travellers into a better mood, or to lay down the law to rail managers when commuter services foul up.</p> <p>He's a cheerful, cheeky chappie with a hard-to-resist line in self-deprecation: \"I've got more chins than the Beijing telephone directory.\" Or, regarding those personal failings: there are no skeletons in his closet - they're all in the graveyard. It's hard, too, to be unimpressed by his individualistic approach to the problems facing the metropolis. For this, he owes something to the third of the ministers he served: the late Nicholas Ridley, at the department of trade and industry.</p> <p>\"From Ridley, I learned to think the unthinkable and, occasionally, to say it. Why not? What's the point of thinking outside the box if it doesn't expand people's understanding of the issues? We both agreed that what business wanted was much less of the DTI which, in those days [early 90s], was even more interventionist than it is now. He was an iconoclast; a Thatcherite before Thatcher.\"</p> <p>Norris's ace card in his campaign is his experience as London's transport minister, from 1992-6. Both Mawhinney and Stephen Joseph, director of Transport 2000, laud him for starting a dialogue with environmental pressure groups for the first time. However, Joseph reckons it was the national rather than the metropolitan implications of his initiatives that had most impact: a national cycling strategy, encouragement of more integrated transport policies, and curbing some controversial road schemes.</p> <p>\"He was very good at listening. He was fairly unideological about things, and would change his argument if he was convinced by what you said,\" Joseph recalls. \"He was a breath of fresh air.\"</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the first batch of ideas Norris has put on his electoral slate are ways of getting sluggish London to move faster. Among his radical notions: lorries would be banned by day and allowed to make deliveries only at night; and bus services would be reorganised into a full 24-hour operation.</p> <p>So what was his best achievement when, as a minister, he had power to change things? \"I always believed in the Jubilee line; that a city like London needs some big infrastructure investment if it's going to stay ahead in Europe. Without the JLE, there could have been no reclamation of the Greenwich peninsula - I pass over the Dome - or huge parts of Bermondsey. Nobody's going to say the JLE isn't worth the money.\" Norris indicates that, when necessary as mayor, he'd be a flexible friend, politically, to Blair's government: in the arguments over how to refurbish, expand and pay for the tube, he's going along with John Prescott's Public-Private Partnership.</p> <p>As a slow and gradual convert to the idea of London having its own city boss (when it was first mooted, he wasn't so keen), he wants a slim authority, not a heavy-handed bureaucracy to run the show. He became an enthusiast because \" it's an attempt to introduce an executive efficiency into the management of a city, as distinct from introducing a great layer of political debate into a city, which is probably not hugely beneficial\".</p> <p>Given these views, and the party-political in-fighting which has hurt Labour and Tory candidates, and given his undoubted success in running commercial enterprises, why doesn't he play down the Conservative connection, and stress his independence as he goes on the stump? \"There's no merit whatsoever for me in distancing myself from the party I'm perfectly comfortable with, and whose support I very much want in order to appeal to some middle-ground voters.\"</p> <p>Norris is good at giving the impression that he's a fresh-thinking politician, capable of throwing caution to the winds, but he never lets go of a basic craftiness, and he knows, when asked for his list of London's high spots and low spots, that, while his choices won't satisfy everyone, they highlight his passion for the turf.</p> <p>So, his likes: London's variety, its villagey feel, from Brick Lane to Belgravia; all-night take-aways, \"the garage down the road where I can get a bottle of milk for Emma at 2am\"; Docklands \"now that it's more oasis than desert\"; the City, with its institutions and traditions; black cabs.</p> <p>And dislikes, some of which, as mayor, he could improve: the seediness of the West End; the bus ser vice; property prices, which mean that \"a teacher married to a nurse can't afford anything decent\"; parks - he knows about scruffiness, Clapham common is the eyesore on his doorstep; education. Expect him to weigh in on the subject, even though schools are not part of the Greater London Authority's duties.</p> <p>So his instinct for popular causes is intact, even though he stood down at the last general election after serving as MP for Oxford East, 1983-7; and Epping Forest, 1988-97. He's followed his own simple rule: he entered politics when he'd made enough in business to live comfortably, and quit when he could no longer afford to live on a ministerial salary.</p> <p>It's Norris's apparent ability to become rich, pursue a political career, and have an impressive number of liaisons while remaining married that has divided many politicians, and much of the public and media, into the enraged and the envious. The popular idea is that the smoothie from Liverpool has had it all, all of the time. The reality, as he is the first to point out, is different.</p> <p>\"I always, in the classic sense, see money as a liberator, not as a toy. I've no great desire to get more money than I now enjoy.\" No clues about how much that is, but enough to put a second son through Eton; help his wife financially (she teaches part-time), employ a secretary/researcher and a chauffeur/personal assistant. Home, he says, is \"a modest Clapham terrace house\". Well, yes, it's a creamy, stylish nook where he lives with his current partner Emma Courtney, 20 years his junior, and their young son Harry.</p> <p>It all began modestly enough in Liverpool, where Steven John Norris was born on May 24, 1945, while his father was away on active service in Belgium. He grew up, till he was 10, in a three-bedroom terraced house in Aigburth. It wasn't cobble-close poverty; both his parents (who are still alive) had jobs. His father worked for the Inland Revenue, his mother as a teacher. They had, by 1955, saved \u00a3550 to buy a modern semi in what Norris calls \"a more salubrious part of south Liverpool\" - Mossley Hill.</p> <p>Norris calls the move to the new house - a distant prospect of the Welsh mountains replacing the close view of the Mersey - \"my first great leap forward\". With loving parents, one younger brother, and being good at school, he continued to jump. First to the famous Liverpool Institute high school for boys (Paul McCartney and George Harrison appear in the same panoramic school photo). Then, with his mum paying for extra tuition so he could pass O-level Latin, to Oxford on an exhibition.</p> <p>He read law at Worcester college, where the expectation was that he'd have a legal career. But his image of solicitors - all stiff collars and conveyancing - and his relative shortage of funds to read for the bar killed that. So, too, did a characteristic restlessness which began early with the excitement of that move to a new home and a new school. Some of Norris's friends say this wanting to move on in part defines his character. It explains why he's juggled his political and business careers; and why he's had a string of mistresses.</p> <p>It's when this restlessness dovetails with his talent for making money that Norris's life gets interesting. Oxford left him with a taste for nice motors, the good life, a belief in his own talents, but without any idea how to magic these up, once he'd left the dreaming spires where, interestingly, he had shown no strong interest in politics.</p> <p>It was a salesman for Burroughs Machines - the brother of Vicky Gibson, the girlfriend he met as a student and married in 1969 - who turned him on to selling. Gibson told him the company was offering a \u00a350 headhunter bonus for each suitable recruit its staff found, and offered to split it if Steven signed up. He did, and sold his first adding machine almost by chance to the owner of a sandwich bar in Cannon Street in the City. He'd wearily dropped in for a cup of tea while doing his rounds; the owner's eye was taken also by the carrying case, which Norris flogged him for the same price as the machine - \u00a387.50 in cash.</p> <p>With Britain going decimal in 1971, there was a huge market in data processing and business management. Realising this, Norris answered an ad: the Ford Motor Company was looking for business management representatives. He had found his m\u00e9tier.</p> <p>He landed on a map of Britain drawn not by the ordnance survey's cartographers, but by Ford chiefs. This divided the country into commercial fiefdoms - highly profitable dealerships licensed to sell their cars. All the big car manufacturing barons had similar maps (Norris later had VW/Audi dealerships), but the game was the same: favoured vassals could get rich in return for their allegiance to the company. True, there were occasional economic downturns, but if Ford smiled on you, additional fiefdoms, sometimes ailing and in need of commercial revival, could come your way. Norris and his fellow directors took every opportunity: \"We were about the most voracious sharks in the Ford ocean at that time\", he says.</p> <p>It was a colourful, cutthroat and fraternal world. One of Norris's early fellow directors, Doug Wimpress, recalls that the philosophy of their boss, Sydney Wood, was \"buy a company that's 40% efficient, take it up to 80% efficiency, sell it, and buy another company at 40%\". Norris says he learned much from Wood, a legend in the business, whose strongest reproof to some of his protege's off-beam ideas was just two words: \"silly boy\".</p> <p>On one occasion, when Wimpress complained that Norris had given him an accurate but incomplete account of a deal he was putting together, Wood cautioned, \"You must always remember that Steve is destined to be a politician.\" That was prescient, because Norris himself at the time didn't acknowledge the lure of politics. In fact, he didn't enter local politics till he was 33, when he became a Berkshire county councillor. What he never did, contrary to popular belief, was sell cars. His skill was with business plans and balance sheets. \"Steve didn't work in the showroom, but he would sell cars to his friends in the pub,\" says Wimpress.</p> <p>And Norris himself confesses that dealing with punters wasn't his forte: \"I was always far too generous to be a good salesman, who has to be absolutely ruthless about having one objective only, which is to relieve you of the largest amount of money, whereas I'd have got you to buy it [a car] then given you far too much off. I'm sorry to say I found selling boring. But the marketing and promotion of ideas was massively satisfying. The ability to encapsulate ideas comes reasonably naturally to me, and if you present things in an accessible form that people can relate to, that's eternally satisfying.\"</p> <p>The rewards, though, were anything but tedious. Even in the 70s, an average Ford dealership would have a turnover of at least \u00a315m, with a standard profit of 18.5% per vehicle, says Wimpress. No wonder he adds, \"The motor trade is like a disease. Once it's in your blood, you never get rid of it.\"</p> <p>It's certainly true that Norris, who has made and lost a million, has the transport gene. On leaving Westminster in 1997 he began rebuilding his fortune with directorships in half a dozen companies in this sector, and becoming head of the Road Haulage Federation on a salary of well over \u00a3100,000. He resigned last summer to enter the mayoral lists, but was scolded recently by the Mail on Sunday for setting up a lavish office in London. Off went a solicitor's letter to the paper with an exasperated Norris muttering about the pettiness of it all: \"\u00a33,000 is what a good sofa costs these days.\"</p> <p>Norris would come to the mayor's office with a clean personal balance sheet. In the early 1990s, he was hit heavily when a company of his, Glentronic (it made equipment for countries with poor mains electricity) went under, owing \u00a3800,000. He lost heavily on property and on his motor business, and he paid a partner to take it off his hands. He went from an income of \u00a3150,000 to an MP's salary, then around \u00a330,000. He explained all this to the apparent satisfaction of the five-man Tory inquisition that vetted his candidature. It would be \"clinically insane\" to lie, he said at the time. Old debts have been cleared; and he has pledged to give up all his directorships if he becomes mayor.</p> <p>But what about the emotional balance sheet? Four ex-mistresses on the debit side; one current partner in the credit column, with the (separated) wife as a carried-over item? Norris's attitude to women is more complex than he lets on. The explanation he offers for the string of long affairs he's had during his marriage is that, though he married for love, he was too young (at 23); that moving to different parts of the country with his motor trade jobs put a strain on him and his wife.</p> <p>What's more, despite the other woman, he's remained on good terms with Vicky, who wouldn't divorce him anyway because she is a devout Catholic. He portrays himself as a martyr to indecision, who could never make the irrevocable decision between spouse and lover; that he can't bear to hurt people; that the messes he used to get himself into were all his fault.</p> <p>At the heart of it all lies his insistence that he wasn't and isn't a philanderer. Though serial, the affairs were separate, he says. \"Separate but overlapping,\" counters one of the famous five: Lynne Taylor, a divorcee who had a three-year fling with him from 1986. She was 39 when they met, and appears to be the only girlfriend, apart from Emma, who managed to get Norris to give her a ring, to which she attached more significance than he did. She thought they were engaged; he didn't.</p> <p>Before Lynne, there was Clare Marx, a doctor; after Lynn there was Sheila Gunn, a political journalist and hopeful Tory parliamentary candidate; and after Sheila, Emma Courtney, with a brief interlude with Jennifer Sharp, a magazine executive. All were seduced by Norris's intelligence, charm, thoughtfulness, humour, and drive. And yet Mrs Taylor, who lives in the west country, wonders why they all succumbed: \"After all, we were all intelligent, attractive women with our own careers.\" And then she answers her own question: \"I suppose if he walked in now, I'd be delighted to see him.\"</p> <p>Norris is quite rueful about all this. He has had to put up with some awful mockery from the media (\"Mr Norris changes dames\" is a favourite headline; a typical cartoon shows a customer buying condoms being asked if he wants a pack of medium, large or Norris). And he's had to put up with a bit of mischief-making. It was perhaps mean of his father-in-law, Rear-Admiral Peter Gibson, to go thundering to the Times last September that Steve could hardly fulfil his intention to marry Emma while not divorced from his daughter, Vicky.</p> <p>\"Clearly, the promise of a marriage to the mother of his illegitimate son in the run-up to an election would be expedient,\" were the rear-admiral's cynical words. Norris was hurt; he's not so daft as to be goaded into ringing the wedding bells during his campaign. Certainly the couple will marry, but it won't be till after May.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Norris seems content. Some men don't grow up till they're in their 50s or 60s, he says. He's matured now, and fortunate. If his luck holds, he could even do the double - getting mayored and married in the same year.</p> <p><b> Life at a glance: Steven John Norris</b></p> <p><b>Born: </b> May 24, 1945, Liverpool.</p> <p><b> Education: </b> Liverpool Institute High School for Boys; Worcester College, Oxford (MA).</p> <p><b> Married: </b> 1969 Peta Veronica (Vicky) Cecil-Gibson (two sons), (separated); current partner Emma Courtney (one son).</p> <p><b> Business career: </b> Salesman for Burroughs Machines; director of companies holding motor dealerships for Ford, Audi, VW; director of the Road Haulage Federation, 1997-9; currently director of, and consultant to, firms in the transport sector<b> .</b></p> <p><b>Parliamentary career: </b> MP (Conservative): Oxford East 1983-87, Epping Forest 1988-97; parliamentary private sectretary to William Waldegrave, DoE (1985-7), Nicholas Ridley, trade and industry (1990), Kenneth Baker, home office (1991-2); under secretary of state, department of transport (1992-6).</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the coming weeks, crowds in London will gasp at the skills of a solo performer who takes more risks than a dome aerialist, does slicker routines than a Fosse hoofer, and cracks more gags than Bob Monkhouse. Enter the official Conservative challenger to become the capital's first elected mayor: Steven Norris. To secure the nomination, Norris has had to demonstrate wondrous powers. First he was defeated by Jeffrey Archer, but re-entered the contest after his main rival was disgraced. Having jumped head first through blazing hoops held by his opponents to get back on the shortlist, he was vanquished a second time when his former constituency denounced him as a liability in a letter to party activists. But eventually he got the nomination, while Archer was banished to the wilderness. For both main political parties, the business of choosing a mayoral runner has been a murky one. Since Labour announced the result of its ballot, it has had to endure a week of farcical knock-about between Frank Dobson and Ken Livingstone, which hasn't done Norris's chances any harm at all. So is Norris gloating at all this? \"I've just been trying to wipe the grin off my face and not intrude on private grief,\" he says. The grin, though, is a wry one, for Norris had a spot of bother with the selection process himself, since both he and Archer had embarrassing histories. Archer differed from him in that he was as famous for concealing his past as Norris was for letting his be paraded publicly. Just before the Daily Mail began serialising Changing Trains, the auto-biography of the former minister and serial philanderer four years ago, Norris was interviewed over lunch by the Mail's doyenne, Lynda Lee-Potter. The resulting piece was a curtain-raiser for the book's spicy tales - \"How the Tory toffs destroyed Thatcher\"; \"Why I threw darts at Heseltine's poster\"; and \"My brief fumble that so excited Edwina Currie\". At the time Norris was on the road to oblivion. He'd given up his career at Westminster; his finances were a shambles; he was separated from his wife. In short, he was a politician who'd been famous for five minutes - and for five mistresses. That might have been unfair, but the public were more likely to remember his amatory exploits and his penchant for making ill-advised quips than for anything he'd achieved in almost five years as minister in charge of transport in London. True to form, that Mail interview ended with Norris remarking that, as he hadn't been recognised by anyone at the Royal Garden Hotel in Kensington during lunch, \"if I ever was to have another affair, this would be the place to come\". Norris claims he did not say it, that the theoretical possibility of the hotel as a trysting place was put to him by Lee-Potter, and, in a tone of strained politeness at a tasteless remark, he gritted his teeth and said \"Er, yeeeess\". Poor Steven Norris; once you've got a reputation for a tearaway tongue, it's hard to plead innocence even if someone's put words into your mouth. Once, as transport minister, he said he preferred cars to buses, because public transport meant sitting alongside awful people (but the irony was lost on the tabloids). As an MP, he joked that his Epping constituency had fallen off the back of a lorry (luckily Essex voters have a sense of humour). And when, in 1995, he was asked on TV why he was voting for John \"back me or sack me\" Major in the leadership election, he famously replied, \"Because he's far and away the least worst option\" (a backhanded compliment that could have meant the chop if the PM had been vengeful). Mixed blessings don't come any bigger than Norris. If he's elected on May 4, Londoners will get a can-do but gaffe-prone mayor. Hague and the shadow cabinet will have the bittersweet experience of seeing a Tory conquering a major political bastion - but a Tory prepared to do business with Blair plc. And Labour will find that, while Norris is far from the stroppiest Tory around, he's a skilled opponent. One or two ancestral Tory snobs sneer that there's a touch of the forecourt about him (referring to his former lucrative motor dealerships), when clearly they'd prefer a touch of the forelock. And it is said that Norris can be a bit of a maverick. However, distinguished greyheads who've worked with him know nothing of these heresies and, while they don't overdo the praise, they allow that he does have good points. Lord (Kenneth) Baker, the former home secretary, says his former PPS is a superb communicator who can create the aura of confidence that will be needed by the capital's boss. \"He's a wonderful spokesman for London. Just right for the job, which is about presentation more than anything else.\" And Sir Brian Mawhinney, the former transport supremo, who had Norris as a junior minister, says he's never worked with anyone more know-ledgeable on London's transport. Mawhinney reckons that his three-year absence from politics is a plus, not a minus, because it will have refreshed his thinking. But what about those mistresses, whose existence incited four members of Norris's former Epping constituency to attempt to sabotage his mayoral chances with a letter denouncing him for having given a false picture of his marriage as stable? Lord Baker cites historic precedents of politicians who have taken a mistress and survived, and dismisses it as a foible. Mawhinney says: \"Steve has set out his private life in what seems a pretty open way to me. Londoners will judge him in the round.\" And, indeed, it's Norris's emollient side that's on display now. He says he'll write his own manifesto, but will get both the shadow cabinet and Tories standing as assembly members to approve it.Labour, of course, would find it a pleasure to do business with him compared with Ken Livingstone. \"People say I get on well with Labour because I'm not greatly detained by the theology of politics,\" says Norris. \"I really am the ultimate pragmatist who wants to do things. Mr Blair and I are not going to fall out about yellow box junction management. On which, as far as I know, neither Marx nor Lenin had much of an opinion. Even Adam Smith is pretty vague on this subject.\" Norris smiles as he delivers another perfect sound-bite. He's a big man - a bit below the 17 stones he peaked at last year; he's lost the rather nerdish look he used to have - the shiny slick of hair; the slightly pinched features. Now, at 55, he looks relaxed and confident enough to jolly a frustrated crowd of tube travellers into a better mood, or to lay down the law to rail managers when commuter services foul up. He's a cheerful, cheeky chappie with a hard-to-resist line in self-deprecation: \"I've got more chins than the Beijing telephone directory.\" Or, regarding those personal failings: there are no skeletons in his closet - they're all in the graveyard. It's hard, too, to be unimpressed by his individualistic approach to the problems facing the metropolis. For this, he owes something to the third of the ministers he served: the late Nicholas Ridley, at the department of trade and industry. \"From Ridley, I learned to think the unthinkable and, occasionally, to say it. Why not? What's the point of thinking outside the box if it doesn't expand people's understanding of the issues? We both agreed that what business wanted was much less of the DTI which, in those days [early 90s], was even more interventionist than it is now. He was an iconoclast; a Thatcherite before Thatcher.\" Norris's ace card in his campaign is his experience as London's transport minister, from 1992-6. Both Mawhinney and Stephen Joseph, director of Transport 2000, laud him for starting a dialogue with environmental pressure groups for the first time. However, Joseph reckons it was the national rather than the metropolitan implications of his initiatives that had most impact: a national cycling strategy, encouragement of more integrated transport policies, and curbing some controversial road schemes. \"He was very good at listening. He was fairly unideological about things, and would change his argument if he was convinced by what you said,\" Joseph recalls. \"He was a breath of fresh air.\" Not surprisingly, the first batch of ideas Norris has put on his electoral slate are ways of getting sluggish London to move faster. Among his radical notions: lorries would be banned by day and allowed to make deliveries only at night; and bus services would be reorganised into a full 24-hour operation. So what was his best achievement when, as a minister, he had power to change things? \"I always believed in the Jubilee line; that a city like London needs some big infrastructure investment if it's going to stay ahead in Europe. Without the JLE, there could have been no reclamation of the Greenwich peninsula - I pass over the Dome - or huge parts of Bermondsey. Nobody's going to say the JLE isn't worth the money.\" Norris indicates that, when necessary as mayor, he'd be a flexible friend, politically, to Blair's government: in the arguments over how to refurbish, expand and pay for the tube, he's going along with John Prescott's Public-Private Partnership. As a slow and gradual convert to the idea of London having its own city boss (when it was first mooted, he wasn't so keen), he wants a slim authority, not a heavy-handed bureaucracy to run the show. He became an enthusiast because \" it's an attempt to introduce an executive efficiency into the management of a city, as distinct from introducing a great layer of political debate into a city, which is probably not hugely beneficial\". Given these views, and the party-political in-fighting which has hurt Labour and Tory candidates, and given his undoubted success in running commercial enterprises, why doesn't he play down the Conservative connection, and stress his independence as he goes on the stump? \"There's no merit whatsoever for me in distancing myself from the party I'm perfectly comfortable with, and whose support I very much want in order to appeal to some middle-ground voters.\" Norris is good at giving the impression that he's a fresh-thinking politician, capable of throwing caution to the winds, but he never lets go of a basic craftiness, and he knows, when asked for his list of London's high spots and low spots, that, while his choices won't satisfy everyone, they highlight his passion for the turf. So, his likes: London's variety, its villagey feel, from Brick Lane to Belgravia; all-night take-aways, \"the garage down the road where I can get a bottle of milk for Emma at 2am\"; Docklands \"now that it's more oasis than desert\"; the City, with its institutions and traditions; black cabs. And dislikes, some of which, as mayor, he could improve: the seediness of the West End; the bus ser vice; property prices, which mean that \"a teacher married to a nurse can't afford anything decent\"; parks - he knows about scruffiness, Clapham common is the eyesore on his doorstep; education. Expect him to weigh in on the subject, even though schools are not part of the Greater London Authority's duties. So his instinct for popular causes is intact, even though he stood down at the last general election after serving as MP for Oxford East, 1983-7; and Epping Forest, 1988-97. He's followed his own simple rule: he entered politics when he'd made enough in business to live comfortably, and quit when he could no longer afford to live on a ministerial salary. It's Norris's apparent ability to become rich, pursue a political career, and have an impressive number of liaisons while remaining married that has divided many politicians, and much of the public and media, into the enraged and the envious. The popular idea is that the smoothie from Liverpool has had it all, all of the time. The reality, as he is the first to point out, is different. \"I always, in the classic sense, see money as a liberator, not as a toy. I've no great desire to get more money than I now enjoy.\" No clues about how much that is, but enough to put a second son through Eton; help his wife financially (she teaches part-time), employ a secretary/researcher and a chauffeur/personal assistant. Home, he says, is \"a modest Clapham terrace house\". Well, yes, it's a creamy, stylish nook where he lives with his current partner Emma Courtney, 20 years his junior, and their young son Harry. It all began modestly enough in Liverpool, where Steven John Norris was born on May 24, 1945, while his father was away on active service in Belgium. He grew up, till he was 10, in a three-bedroom terraced house in Aigburth. It wasn't cobble-close poverty; both his parents (who are still alive) had jobs. His father worked for the Inland Revenue, his mother as a teacher. They had, by 1955, saved \u00a3550 to buy a modern semi in what Norris calls \"a more salubrious part of south Liverpool\" - Mossley Hill. Norris calls the move to the new house - a distant prospect of the Welsh mountains replacing the close view of the Mersey - \"my first great leap forward\". With loving parents, one younger brother, and being good at school, he continued to jump. First to the famous Liverpool Institute high school for boys (Paul McCartney and George Harrison appear in the same panoramic school photo). Then, with his mum paying for extra tuition so he could pass O-level Latin, to Oxford on an exhibition. He read law at Worcester college, where the expectation was that he'd have a legal career. But his image of solicitors - all stiff collars and conveyancing - and his relative shortage of funds to read for the bar killed that. So, too, did a characteristic restlessness which began early with the excitement of that move to a new home and a new school. Some of Norris's friends say this wanting to move on in part defines his character. It explains why he's juggled his political and business careers; and why he's had a string of mistresses. It's when this restlessness dovetails with his talent for making money that Norris's life gets interesting. Oxford left him with a taste for nice motors, the good life, a belief in his own talents, but without any idea how to magic these up, once he'd left the dreaming spires where, interestingly, he had shown no strong interest in politics. It was a salesman for Burroughs Machines - the brother of Vicky Gibson, the girlfriend he met as a student and married in 1969 - who turned him on to selling. Gibson told him the company was offering a \u00a350 headhunter bonus for each suitable recruit its staff found, and offered to split it if Steven signed up. He did, and sold his first adding machine almost by chance to the owner of a sandwich bar in Cannon Street in the City. He'd wearily dropped in for a cup of tea while doing his rounds; the owner's eye was taken also by the carrying case, which Norris flogged him for the same price as the machine - \u00a387.50 in cash.

And he's had to put up with a bit of mischief-making. It was perhaps mean of his father-in-law, Rear-Admiral Peter Gibson, to go thundering to the Times last September that Steve could hardly fulfil his intention to marry Emma while not divorced from his daughter, Vicky. \"Clearly, the promise of a marriage to the mother of his illegitimate son in the run-up to an election would be expedient,\" were the rear-admiral's cynical words. Norris was hurt; he's not so daft as to be goaded into ringing the wedding bells during his campaign. Certainly the couple will marry, but it won't be till after May. Meanwhile, Norris seems content. Some men don't grow up till they're in their 50s or 60s, he says. He's matured now, and fortunate. If his luck holds, he could even do the double - getting mayored and married in the same year. Life at a glance: Steven John Norris Born: May 24, 1945, Liverpool. Education: Liverpool Institute High School for Boys; Worcester College, Oxford (MA). Married: 1969 Peta Veronica (Vicky) Cecil-Gibson (two sons), (separated); current partner Emma Courtney (one son).

Not only does it give us plebs an insight into the bounteous generosity that flows in one's direction the moment fame and influence are in the bag. But as with the Confessional Box, a simple genuflexion of the Biro in the Parliamentary naughty book and you've got away with it. </p> <p>John Prescott has make a clean breast of his second freebie limo, William Hague has come clean about having Seb Coe's Range Rover on long-term loan (how peculiar is that?), Mo Mowlam has owned up to the cartoons she collects of herself, and Tony Blair has made his wincingly honest free holiday admission (\"August 1999, accompanied by my family, I spent nine days as a guest of Signor Chiti, the president of the Tuscan government\"). What more is there to say? That there is hypocrisy in the air? (Hardly.) That our MPs live a life of freeloading luxury? (It's a pretty seedy life, actually, and the ligging barely gets out of the blocks compared with that in corporate - or journalistic for that matter - Britain). As for the possibility that undue influence might be exercised upon the recipient by the donor, well, yes, but the register rather absolves that potential sin by exposing it to public view before it's had a chance to happen. </p> <p>So if Mr Prescott wants to grant some privilege to Rover (who supply his 800 model for party events and campaigning, when he can't use the government Jag), we will at least have the chance to analyse what lay behind the Blind Eye to Anything Rover Gets Up to Act (2000). For the maintenance of the quality of public life, if nothing else, it is vital that extracurricular goodies be available over and above piddling Parliamentary salaries. Who otherwise would bother going through the humiliation and misery of being selected and elected as an MP?

      "bodyText": "What a wondrous thing is the Register of Members' Interests, published this week. Not only does it give us plebs an insight into the bounteous generosity that flows in one's direction the moment fame and influence are in the bag. But as with the Confessional Box, a simple genuflexion of the Biro in the Parliamentary naughty book and you've got away with it. John Prescott has make a clean breast of his second freebie limo, William Hague has come clean about having Seb Coe's Range Rover on long-term loan (how peculiar is that?), Mo Mowlam has owned up to the cartoons she collects of herself, and Tony Blair has made his wincingly honest free holiday admission (\"August 1999, accompanied by my family, I spent nine days as a guest of Signor Chiti, the president of the Tuscan government\"). What more is there to say? That there is hypocrisy in the air? (Hardly.) That our MPs live a life of freeloading luxury? (It's a pretty seedy life, actually, and the ligging barely gets out of the blocks compared with that in corporate - or journalistic for that matter - Britain). As for the possibility that undue influence might be exercised upon the recipient by the donor, well, yes, but the register rather absolves that potential sin by exposing it to public view before it's had a chance to happen. So if Mr Prescott wants to grant some privilege to Rover (who supply his 800 model for party events and campaigning, when he can't use the government Jag), we will at least have the chance to analyse what lay behind the Blind Eye to Anything Rover Gets Up to Act (2000). For the maintenance of the quality of public life, if nothing else, it is vital that extracurricular goodies be available over and above piddling Parliamentary salaries. Who otherwise would bother going through the humiliation and misery of being selected and elected as an MP? Do we really want a House of Commons peopled by dreary ascetics, whose only virtue is that they are clean? Or is it better to be governed by men and women of the world, who know a thing or two about kickbacks and perks thanks to the experience of being offered them on a daily basis? To put it another way, the society we have here has a multiplicity of troughs.

After only eight months Catledge abruptly ordered the critic's dismissal, apparently because he thought Kauffmann's reviews were too negative. After five years as managing editor, Daniel, in the delicate language of corporate infighting, \"yielded\" his job to AM Rosenthal and went off to run the paper's syndication services and work for its radio stations. During the Watergate crisis, he wrote commentaries from Washington; drawing on the journalistic lessons of that period, he built up a team of investigative reporters. He retired in 1977. He is survived by his wife, their four sons, and five grandchildren. \u0095 Elbert Clifton Daniel, journalist, born September 19 1912; died February 21 2000",

Whitehall appears to believe this would be a less controversial course than resorting to the official secrets act and subsequent embarrassing and high- profile criminal prosecutions. Another advantage for Whitehall is that civil judgments can be enforced in foreign jurisdictions, lawyers said yesterday. MI5 and MI6 are desperately concerned about the way original injunctions obtained in 1997 have been steadily eroded, largely because the information has been published abroad or on the internet. This enabled the Guardian last year to publish details of Mr Shayler's allegation that MI6 was involved in a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy - confirmed recently, despite official denials, by an MI6 document placed on the internet. Mr Shayler also revealed the existence of MI5 reports on the bombing of the Israeli embassy in London in 1994.

She had taken to the air for freedom, to fly away from the formality of her life around the Elys\u00e9e Palace as the daughter-in-law of the president of the French Republic.</p> <p>Born in the Vend\u00e9e, she had gone to Paris to study art at the Ecole du Louvre, and at 21, married Paul Auriol, then a student at Sciences Politiques. His father, Vincent Auriol, was a prominent Socialist and known to be opposed to the P\u00e9tain regime under the German occupation of France during the second world war.</p> <p>After the war, Vincent Auriol became president in 1947, and Paul acted as his press secretary: Jacqueline's function, as a famous beauty, was to socialise in a Paris attempting to regain its worldwide reputation for luxury living and exports. (Christian Dior's New Look fashion collection was shown in 1947.)</p> <p>Paris also had a reputation for the finest aerodrome in Europe, Orly, which had a civilised identity when Heathrow was still a gathering of huts; French postwar aviation was also experimenting with a new sea plane, the Nord I 400, baptised at Le Havre.</p> <p>Encouraged by her husband, Jacqueline Auriol learned to fly, gaining her first pilot's certificate in 1948. She took part in a competition flight between Algiers and Dakar and then, in July 1949, demonstrated her skills at the Paris air show. A few days later, she was sitting next to the pilot in a twin-motored hydroplane, SCAN-30 when it crashed into the Seine. She was badly hurt, with severe facial injuries. The press announced that the most beautiful woman in Paris would be permanently disfigured.</p> <p>But Auriol was determined that this should not happen, and after many operations in France and the US, she emerged with a new face and a new determination to conquer the air. In the US, she had learned how to pilot helicopters and taken a military training course. In May 1951, she took off from Marseilles at the controls of the jet- engined British de Havilland Vampire and became the fastest woman in the world, flying at 818 kilometres an hour over a test course of 100 kilometres. The next year she became a national heroine by improving her time, reaching 855 kph in a French-built Mistral. In 1954, she qualified as a test pilot, claiming to be the first woman to do so, and five years later flew at Mach 2, twice the speed of sound.

      "bodyText": "Jacqueline Auriol, who has died aged 82, was France's first woman test pilot. She had taken to the air for freedom, to fly away from the formality of her life around the Elys\u00e9e Palace as the daughter-in-law of the president of the French Republic. Born in the Vend\u00e9e, she had gone to Paris to study art at the Ecole du Louvre, and at 21, married Paul Auriol, then a student at Sciences Politiques. His father, Vincent Auriol, was a prominent Socialist and known to be opposed to the P\u00e9tain regime under the German occupation of France during the second world war. After the war, Vincent Auriol became president in 1947, and Paul acted as his press secretary: Jacqueline's function, as a famous beauty, was to socialise in a Paris attempting to regain its worldwide reputation for luxury living and exports. (Christian Dior's New Look fashion collection was shown in 1947.) Paris also had a reputation for the finest aerodrome in Europe, Orly, which had a civilised identity when Heathrow was still a gathering of huts; French postwar aviation was also experimenting with a new sea plane, the Nord I 400, baptised at Le Havre. Encouraged by her husband, Jacqueline Auriol learned to fly, gaining her first pilot's certificate in 1948. She took part in a competition flight between Algiers and Dakar and then, in July 1949, demonstrated her skills at the Paris air show. A few days later, she was sitting next to the pilot in a twin-motored hydroplane, SCAN-30 when it crashed into the Seine. She was badly hurt, with severe facial injuries. The press announced that the most beautiful woman in Paris would be permanently disfigured. But Auriol was determined that this should not happen, and after many operations in France and the US, she emerged with a new face and a new determination to conquer the air. In the US, she had learned how to pilot helicopters and taken a military training course. In May 1951, she took off from Marseilles at the controls of the jet- engined British de Havilland Vampire and became the fastest woman in the world, flying at 818 kilometres an hour over a test course of 100 kilometres. The next year she became a national heroine by improving her time, reaching 855 kph in a French-built Mistral. In 1954, she qualified as a test pilot, claiming to be the first woman to do so, and five years later flew at Mach 2, twice the speed of sound. Auriol and her friend, the American pilot Jacqueline Cochrane, competed for world supremacy. The record passed between them nine times, with Auriol winning five of the records, before the competition finally ended in 1964, when Cochrane reached 2,097 kilometres an hour, beating Auriol's 2,040 kph in a Mirage III-R the previous year. Auriol was well known for the calm and matter-of-fact way she reported her achievements. In 1956, a Mirage IV that she was testing got out of control, and it was only at the last minute that she was able to recover and effect a rough but safe landing. \"I've made a bit of a mess of the grass,\" was her only comment. After her retirement from aviation, she continued to support other women pilots, and in 1968 published a book, Vivre et Voler. \"Truth is with me when I fly,\" she once wrote.\"Now I know that only life and death are important.\" She is survived by her two sons. Jacqueline Auriol, aviator, born November 5 1917; died February 11 2000",

      "bodyText": "China's human rights record \"deteriorated markedly\" last year as Beijing cracked down on a fledgling opposition party and on the Falun Gong sect, the US state department reported yesterday. The state department's critical assessment of Beijing's record is likely to increase the election-year controversy surrounding President Bill Clinton's open-door policy towards China and his support for the communist state's admission to the World Trade Organisation. But the president defended his policy yesterday. \"I hope all of you will support my attempt to bring China into the World Trade Organisation by giving them permanent normal trading status,\" Mr Clinton said at a Democratic party meeting. \"I think it's very important - not just for economic reasons _ it would be very good for the cause of freedom and human rights in China.\" However, the report said that, in violation of international conventions, several thousand people were in Chinese jails for peacefully expressing their political, religious and social views. There were mass roundups of suspected dissidents in May and September, and during the course of the year, fewer political prisoners than usual were released early. The new political prisoners included almost all of the fledgling China Democratic Party's top leaders, who were either sentenced \"in closed trials that flagrantly violated due process\" to long prison terms for subversion or were being detained without charge. The crack down left only a handful of dissidents outside prison willing to remain publicly active. Tens of thousands of Falun Gong members were also rounded up and detained in sports stadiums where they were forced to sign renunciations of their beliefs. Those who refused to recant were imprisoned, sent to \"re-education through labour\" camps, or confined to psychiatric hospitals, the report said. Other abuses listed by the report include \"extrajudicial killings, torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, arbitrary arrest and detention, lengthy incommunicado detention and denial of due process\". The Clinton administration, however, insists that it is maintaining pressure on Beijing in regard to human rights.",

Now he wants the nine-member committee to wake up to the profound economic effect of the internet. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Since joining the monetary policy committee little more than six months ago, Sushil Wadhwani, former LSE academic and hedge fund manager, has persuaded the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street to adapt her thinking about sterling and helped to ensure that the four independent members have the same research facilities as their colleagues on the Bank's staff. Now he wants the nine-member committee to wake up to the profound economic effect of the internet. </p> <p>Mr Wadhwani believes that the net could mark a turning pointing in the history of information technology which may transform the British economy along American lines. While he warns against technological utopianism, he believes business on the net could boost productivity growth and help keep the lid on inflation. As a result, the Bank has some thinking to do. </p> <p>Mr Wadhwani believes it should revisit its assumption that long-term productivity growth remains stuck in the doldrums at 2% a year. He also believes the Bank should make greater allowances for the squeeze in profit margins which would result from increased competition. </p> <p>If it did so, it might be able to let the economy grow faster than before, with obvious benefits for living standards. </p> <p>Not all the members of the committee agree with Mr Wadhwani's analysis. DeAnne Julius, former British Airways chief economist, is an ally but Mervyn King, the influential deputy governor for monetary analysis, appears to be a new economy sceptic, arguing that there is nothing in the official productivity data to suggest a net-driven improvement in the economy's supply side performance. </p> <p>Mr Wadhwani, at 40 the youngest member of the committee, agrees but says there is enough anecdotal and survey evidence to suggest the data may be lagging behind reality. With this in mind he feels that waiting for definitive proof of an increase in productivity is too risky and will restrict growth in the meantime. </p> <p><strong> Following intuition</strong></p> <p>Like Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, he is prepared to base policy on intuition rather than following old fashioned rules of thumb about how the economy behaves. </p> <p>\"Chairman Greenspan, back in 1996, was already running monetary policy on the basis that it was possible that productivity growth was going to be higher than it had been, even though at that stage there was not a single study of US productivity growth which showed an uptick,\" says Mr Wadhwani. The result has been a record-breaking expansion lasting 107 consecutive months. </p> <p>\"I think in some sense when we make our forecast we should form our best judgment of what productivity growth is going to do and... I think the reason we might get an uptick is we have seen it in the US. We are a little bit behind but does give me some confidence,\" he says. </p> <p>Mr Wadhwani's optimistic pointers include a small but rapidly expanding and highly productive IT sector, big cost savings being made by companies using the net to shorten supply chains and that the rate of return in manufacturing industry continued to rise between 1995 and 1997 even though measured productivity apparently remained unchanged. His open-minded approach to the job of setting interest rates owes much to the 8 years he spent in the markets, initially as director of equity strategy at Goldman Sachs, when he was ranked number one by Institutional Investor Survey, and latterly as director of research and partner of the Tudor Group hedge fund. </p> <p>\"For me... I think if I got this job straight from the LSE I think I would have relied more on my models than I do now,\" says Mr Wadhwani. \"I think having been in the City and having got things wrong teaches you to be critical of every tool that you use. But it's absolutely critical to have a judgmental override at the end of the day, a kind of commonsense test because otherwise your models can really lead you astray.\" </p> <p>His experience in the markets is one of the strengths he brings to the MPC, often criticised for being packed with pointy heads. It enabled him to convince the Bank that sterling may remain stronger than previously predicted by the Bank's model, prompting a rethink which has helped limit the extent to which interest rates have had to rise to contain inflation. </p> <p>But he is far from being an archetypal City figure. A courteous and gentle Kenyan Indian, Mr Wadhwani was born and brought up in Mombassa. He lived there until the age of nine when his family left the country to escape anti-Asian feeling. He and his sister were sent to boarding school in India, while the rest of the family came to England. He joined them at the age of 16 to do his A levels at a sixth form college in northwest London before getting a place at the LSE in 1977, initially intending to become an accountant but switching to economics. </p> <p>He stayed on to do his MSc and Phd and joined the LSE staff in 1984. Much of his early research focused on unemployment, wages, profit-sharing and unions. His present job reunites him with several former LSE colleagues. He was taught by Willem Buiter and has written papers with Professor King; Charles Goodhart was his professorial adviser when he was first appointed a lecturer.

      "bodyText": "Since joining the monetary policy committee little more than six months ago, Sushil Wadhwani, former LSE academic and hedge fund manager, has persuaded the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street to adapt her thinking about sterling and helped to ensure that the four independent members have the same research facilities as their colleagues on the Bank's staff. Now he wants the nine-member committee to wake up to the profound economic effect of the internet. Mr Wadhwani believes that the net could mark a turning pointing in the history of information technology which may transform the British economy along American lines. While he warns against technological utopianism, he believes business on the net could boost productivity growth and help keep the lid on inflation. As a result, the Bank has some thinking to do. Mr Wadhwani believes it should revisit its assumption that long-term productivity growth remains stuck in the doldrums at 2% a year. He also believes the Bank should make greater allowances for the squeeze in profit margins which would result from increased competition. If it did so, it might be able to let the economy grow faster than before, with obvious benefits for living standards. Not all the members of the committee agree with Mr Wadhwani's analysis. DeAnne Julius, former British Airways chief economist, is an ally but Mervyn King, the influential deputy governor for monetary analysis, appears to be a new economy sceptic, arguing that there is nothing in the official productivity data to suggest a net-driven improvement in the economy's supply side performance. Mr Wadhwani, at 40 the youngest member of the committee, agrees but says there is enough anecdotal and survey evidence to suggest the data may be lagging behind reality. With this in mind he feels that waiting for definitive proof of an increase in productivity is too risky and will restrict growth in the meantime. Following intuition Like Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, he is prepared to base policy on intuition rather than following old fashioned rules of thumb about how the economy behaves. \"Chairman Greenspan, back in 1996, was already running monetary policy on the basis that it was possible that productivity growth was going to be higher than it had been, even though at that stage there was not a single study of US productivity growth which showed an uptick,\" says Mr Wadhwani. The result has been a record-breaking expansion lasting 107 consecutive months. \"I think in some sense when we make our forecast we should form our best judgment of what productivity growth is going to do and... I think the reason we might get an uptick is we have seen it in the US. We are a little bit behind but does give me some confidence,\" he says. Mr Wadhwani's optimistic pointers include a small but rapidly expanding and highly productive IT sector, big cost savings being made by companies using the net to shorten supply chains and that the rate of return in manufacturing industry continued to rise between 1995 and 1997 even though measured productivity apparently remained unchanged. His open-minded approach to the job of setting interest rates owes much to the 8 years he spent in the markets, initially as director of equity strategy at Goldman Sachs, when he was ranked number one by Institutional Investor Survey, and latterly as director of research and partner of the Tudor Group hedge fund. \"For me... I think if I got this job straight from the LSE I think I would have relied more on my models than I do now,\" says Mr Wadhwani. \"I think having been in the City and having got things wrong teaches you to be critical of every tool that you use. But it's absolutely critical to have a judgmental override at the end of the day, a kind of commonsense test because otherwise your models can really lead you astray.\" His experience in the markets is one of the strengths he brings to the MPC, often criticised for being packed with pointy heads. It enabled him to convince the Bank that sterling may remain stronger than previously predicted by the Bank's model, prompting a rethink which has helped limit the extent to which interest rates have had to rise to contain inflation. But he is far from being an archetypal City figure. A courteous and gentle Kenyan Indian, Mr Wadhwani was born and brought up in Mombassa. He lived there until the age of nine when his family left the country to escape anti-Asian feeling. He and his sister were sent to boarding school in India, while the rest of the family came to England. He joined them at the age of 16 to do his A levels at a sixth form college in northwest London before getting a place at the LSE in 1977, initially intending to become an accountant but switching to economics. He stayed on to do his MSc and Phd and joined the LSE staff in 1984. Much of his early research focused on unemployment, wages, profit-sharing and unions. His present job reunites him with several former LSE colleagues. He was taught by Willem Buiter and has written papers with Professor King; Charles Goodhart was his professorial adviser when he was first appointed a lecturer. Stephen Nickell, due to join the MPC in June when Prof Buiter steps down, supervised Mr Wadhwani's theses on inflation and unemployment, and they have collaborated on a number of projects since. In 1990, Mr Wadhwani was lured from academia to the City, where he remained until the call from the treasury came out of the blue last year. \"I knew I had to do it straight away but I couldn't say yes straight away because I had to talk to family and to my employer. I think I made up my mind in the first five minutes.\" The new job has freed him of profit and loss stress but he laughs at the suggestion that it is more relaxed than working at a hedge fund. \"It's such an important decision that you are helping to make that you obviously agonise over it, at least I do,\" he says, confessing to not sleeping well the night before the MPC's monthly vote. He ranks this month's decision as the most difficult he has made. Despite his views on the disinflationary impact of the net, Mr Wadhwani was one of eight committee members to vote for a quarter point increase in the repo rate to 6%. 'Don't get carried away' Although he says the economic effects of the net could be as profound as the telegraph was in the 19th century, he cautions against getting carried away and assuming it has repealed the laws of supply and demand. \"The internet has important disinflationary effects without implying the death of inflation,\" he says. In the short term Mr Wadhwani is keeping a wary eye on earnings growth, which hit 5.5% in the latest quarter - an \"awfully high\" figure if it was reliable and unlikely to be justified by productivity growth. He says it could be a blip due to one-off millennium bonus payments, a distortion which will wash out of the data over the next few months. Also on his radar screen is the housing market, where prices are rising at the fastest rate since the late 1980s boom. Mr Wadhwani is not panicking yet, pointing out that the ratio of house prices to earnings is not at a crazy level but he fears a destabilising housing market bubble. \"If there were signs of it occurring then we would clearly have to act,\" he says. Anxious to avoid treading on the chancellor's toes before the Budget, Mr Wadhwani sidesteps a question about whether Gordon Brown should use fiscal policy to damp down the housing market. Pressed, he confesses to thinking the government may be wise to rewrite the MPC's remit to take more explicit account of the danger of asset price booms. The committee only looks at house and share prices only as far as they effect the outlook for inflation over a two-year horizon. Yet the experience of Japan in the late 1980s and now the US has shown that asset prices bubbles can take longer to feed through into general inflation, by which time the damage to an economy is done. \"It's up to chancellor to set the target and therefore in one sense it is none of my business,\" says Mr Wadhwani. \"Having said that my personal view is that we need to look at this issue and re-examine it. At the moment our overriding objective is price stability but we have subsidiary objectives in terms of output and employment and I think asset prices could be put into that to emphasise their importance.\"",

      "body": "<p>On any clear winter evening you can watch the wonderful light display from the Beaumaris road that's cut into the wooded cliff. It is free. Out across the black waters of Menai we can pick out the navigation lights on Bangor pier and the myriad lights of the town behind. Look away towards the south-east and follow the golden lantern crocodile that is the North Wales expressway, an undulating necklace of light that sways past Abergwyngregyn, Llanfairfechan and Penmaenmawr as far as the Conwy's mouth. Far out to sea are the speckled lights of Llandudno's west shore and the glare beyond that comes from the main town.

They built what has been called \"a factory in a garden\". It was surrounded by parks and good housing which was not restricted to Cadbury workers. Works committees were set up within the factory, with equal numbers of workers and management being elected by secret ballot. </p> <p>In 1900 George Cadbury gave the estate, but not the factory, to the Bournville Village Trust, which was charged with enlarging it and promoting housing reform. Today the estate covers about 1,000 acres and includes parks, churches, shops and community halls but no pubs - in deference to its Quaker origins and the wishes of its inhabitants, less than half of whom have links with the Cadbury factory. </p> <p>Cadbury sells more than 250m Dairy Milk bars, worth about \u00a3100m, a year. The recipe has remained virtually unchanged, but the brand has been widened to cover more than 40 different products.

The little extra effort required to cook the real McCoy, though time-consuming, is paid back in abundance - using the coarse-grained polenta renders a light texture with a good bite. </p> <p>For the polenta </p> <p><strong> 1.5 litres water </strong></p> <p><strong>Salt </strong></p> <p><strong>300g coarse polenta </strong></p> <p><strong>30g Parmesan, grated (optional)</strong> </p> <p>For the sauce </p> <p><strong> Olive oil, for frying </strong></p> <p><strong>500g sliced onions </strong></p> <p><strong>1 tsp white-wine vinegar </strong></p> <p><strong>Sea salt and black pepper </strong></p> <p><strong>50g unsalted butter </strong></p> <p><strong>60ml whipping cream </strong></p> <p><strong>30ml chicken stock (or water) </strong></p> <p><strong>6 x 25g slices Taleggio, Gorgonzola or grated Parmesan</strong> </p> <p>First, make the polenta. Put the water into a stainless-steel pan, add a little salt, and bring to a boil. Whisking the water constantly, pour in the polenta in a fine shower - this way, you can ensure that no lumps will form in the hot liquid. Once all the polenta flour has been mixed into the water, reduce the heat and cook gently for 40 minutes, stirring all the while. If you have to leave the pan unattended for a minute or so, ensure that you give it a good stir along the bottom and sides beforehand. Once cooked, spread the polenta out on a lightly-oiled baking tray, cover and set aside to cool. </p> <p>Now make the sauce. In a heavy-based pan, heat the oil, then tip in the onions. Stir for a few minutes, making sure that the onions do not take on any colour, then reduce the heat and leave to sweat down for half an hour, by which time they should be softened and pale. Turn up the heat and add the vinegar, stirring until it has evaporated, then add the salt, pepper, butter, stock (or water) and cream. Leave to simmer for a further 10 minutes, to allow the liquid to reduce and adhere to the onions. Remove from the heat, and keep warm. (This part of the dish can be prepared in advance and reheated gently prior to serving, if needs be.) </p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. Cut the polenta into 12 slices, sprinkle lightly with oil, then lay them under a low-medium-heat grill (or, if you prefer, on a griddle pan) until a dark crust has formed on one side. Turn over the slices, and cook the other side in the same way. </p> <p>Lay six of the slices on a lightly-oiled baking tray, spoon over a little of the creamy-onion sauce, lay on a slice of cheese, then top with another slice of polenta. Bake for four to five minutes, and serve at once, with a little grated Parmesan, if you wish. </p> <p><strong> Grilled rabbit with trevisse</strong></p> <p>The wonderful, deep red of Trevisse and radicchio lettuces is gorgeous and the flavour is quite bitter. Out of season, that bitterness is even more pronounced, so you can only tell by tasting a leaf if it's suitable for grilling, which intensifies the bitter flavour, or for roasting, which makes it milder. These are prized vegetables, and so need treating with respect - they are most definitely not to be used as a pretty salad leaf. Also, please don't use that cheap balsamic condiment that dominates the supermarket shelves, as it seems more related to vanilla essence than to true balsamic. The good stuff is expensive, sure, but then you need use only a couple of drops at a time.</p> <p><strong> 750g trevisse or radicchio </strong></p> <p><strong>6 rabbit legs, unboned </strong></p> <p><strong>120g pancetta (or smoked streaky bacon) </strong></p> <p><strong>12-18 fresh sage leaves </strong></p> <p><strong>1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed </strong></p> <p><strong>Top-quality balsamic vinegar </strong></p> <p><strong>Olive oil </strong></p> <p><strong>Milled black pepper</strong> </p> <p>Cut the trevisse lengthways into quarters and wash well, discarding any blemished leaves. Heat up the grill (or a griddle pan). Brush the rabbit with a little oil, then lay them under the grill - keep the heat at a medium level, to avoid any unnecessary charring: blackened foods cause indigestion, not pleasure. </p> <p>Remove the rind from the bacon, cut the meat into little strips and fry gently in a heavy pan. Add the sage and a pinch of pepper, stir and put to one side. Once the rabbit is marked and coloured all over, and quite cooked within (about 10-15 minutes), put the legs into the bacon pan, along with the garlic and three or four drops of the vinegar. Roll the rabbit pieces around in the pan until they are thoroughly dressed in the bacon, sage and balsamic. </p> <p>Wipe the grill pan clean, lay on the prepared pieces of trevisse, and place under the hot grill. After five or so minutes, turn the pieces over and drizzle over a little olive oil. Cook until the leaves are soft and tender (they will lose most of their colour). Once done, serve the trevisse on to plates and place the rabbit on top. Spoon over any liquor from the frying pan. </p> <p><strong> A curd made from seville oranges</strong></p> <p> A very good dinner recently at the Cow - the current culinary home of the great Juliet Peston and Weekend's very own Kitchen Doctor, Rosie Sykes - was finished with an elegant pastry crust filled with a Seville orange curd. It was splendid. The only time I have ever cooked in a microwave was a very long time ago, when I was working for a catering company: the only good use I found for it was for making a batch of lemon curd, as it meant that you did not have to stand there stirring the mix constantly.

Juice the oranges and pass it through a fine-mesh sieve. Place the zest, juice, sugar, butter and eggs in a Pyrex bowl and place in the microwave. </p> <p>I used to cook this at two- to three-minute intervals, then give the curd a whisk, and repeat the whole process until the curd was done. However, as I said, it was an awfully long time ago, and I have no real recollection of just how powerful that particular machine was. As such, it would be best in this instance if you followed the cooking instructions for your own machine. Whatever interval you cook at, each time the pinger goes off, give the curd a good whisk. Continue thus until the curd has thickened and is fully cooked. </p> <p>Curd must not be in the least bit thin, and even though there are eggs within there is little chance of it splitting.

      "body": "<p>Everton's Don Hutchison paid a high price for his hard-headedness yesterday when he was stripped of his club's captaincy and put on the transfer list. </p> <p>Less than 24 hours after he abandoned all hope of negotiating a new deal at Goodison Park, his manager Walter Smith announced that the Scottish international midfielder would be omitted from the side to face West Ham United at Upton Park thisafternoon, and it seems highly unlikely he will play again for Everton. </p> <p>Hutchison's attempts to convince the club he was worthy of a 100% pay rise - from \u00a38,000 a week to \u00a316,000 - ended in failure on Thursday when talks collapsed. </p> <p>\"I wanted to stay. I wanted to sign for life. A lot of fans are thinking I'm asking for the earth but that's rubbish,\" he said yesterday. </p> <p>\"I was just looking for parity with some of the other players. What they offered me was a disgrace.

      "bodyText": "Everton's Don Hutchison paid a high price for his hard-headedness yesterday when he was stripped of his club's captaincy and put on the transfer list. Less than 24 hours after he abandoned all hope of negotiating a new deal at Goodison Park, his manager Walter Smith announced that the Scottish international midfielder would be omitted from the side to face West Ham United at Upton Park thisafternoon, and it seems highly unlikely he will play again for Everton. Hutchison's attempts to convince the club he was worthy of a 100% pay rise - from \u00a38,000 a week to \u00a316,000 - ended in failure on Thursday when talks collapsed. \"I wanted to stay. I wanted to sign for life. A lot of fans are thinking I'm asking for the earth but that's rubbish,\" he said yesterday. \"I was just looking for parity with some of the other players. What they offered me was a disgrace. They turned around and said I had a week to accept and if I didn't they'd sell me, but I have rejected it.\" \"He will definitely not feature against West Ham,\" said Smith. \"I do not believe he will be in the right frame of mind after the events of this week. I think leaving him out of my starting line-up is the best way to handle the situation.\" Although the versatile 28-year-old still has 16 months left to run on his current contract, Smith will now seek to sell him for about \u00a33m. Despite his reputation as a maverick, Hutchison has many admirers, including the Sunderland manager Peter Reid who is anxious to strengthen his squad after the serious injury to Gavin McCann. \"I think Don Hutchison is a good player and we will certainly be monitoring,\" Reid said.

      "body": "<p>For one Leicester City fan, tomorrow's return to Wembley for the Worthington Cup final is a bittersweet occasion. Although she used to be a season ticket holder, Ruth Lelacheur, her partner Jim Blockley and five-year-old daughter Megan have not been to a match since Leicester's 1-0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur in last year's final. </p> <p>Lelacheur has been unable to summon the courage or inclination to push herself through a football turnstile because of a sickening physical assault that day, which destroyed her family outing almost before it had begun. The man who punched her minutes after the kick-off was a Tottenham fan who, on the black market, had illegally purchased tickets for the Leicester family enclosure. </p> <p>Eleven months on, Lelacheur and her family, who live a long goal-kick from Filbert Street, had planned to watch tomorrow's game against Tranmere Rovers at a local working men's club - until Leicester offered all four of them, including three-year-old son James, free tickets and travel to the game. </p> <p>The club, of course, rejects the notion that its generosity is anything other than a gesture of sympathy, even though seven of its players have Football Association misconduct charges hanging over them, the result of an investigation into how Spurs fans obtained tickets to the Leicester end of the ground. </p> <p>\"I didn't make my mind up to go to Wembley until a few days ago,\" Lelacheur says. \"It's not that I'm afraid of it happening again, just the bad memories. Megan wouldn't sleep in her own bed for some time afterwards and she was horrified when she saw a photograph of the incident in the newspapers. She said: 'If that man had killed you, I wouldn't have had a mummy, would I?' We had to tell her the man was locked up to stop her worrying.\" </p> <p>Police at Wembley last March apprehended her assailant, but opted to eject him rather than charge him. Despite the now infamous photo which shows the thug's fist exploding on Lelacheur's jaw - an image football believed it had eradicated - no one has been charged. </p> <p>Lelacheur says: \"That is what makes me so angry. If he can hit a woman for no reason, what else might he have done at other matches? </p> <p>\"The irony is, we had paid extra to go into the family enclosure because we thought it would be that little bit safer. And we could not have asked for a better position to see the match.\" </p> <p>Unfortunately it was only a few minutes old when Lelacheur was sent reeling backwards from a stinging blow to her jaw, at the same time catching a glimpse of Megan being pushed over amid a melee of people. </p> <p>\"Luckily someone scooped Megan up and handed her back to Jim,\" she says, \"but I couldn't stop trembling afterwards, thinking what might have happened. I was in a lot of pain when they took me to the treatment room, but there wasn't much they could do because one of my teeth had all but crumbled away. I was more upset about seeing Megan in tears. </p> <p>\"She looked a right mess, when minutes before she had been such a happy little girl. She looked really lovely in this bright green cagoule and was carrying a little silver cup Jim had made for her. Even the Sky TV cameras picked her out. </p> <p><strong> Day out in ruins</strong><br> \"It was terrible our day could have been ruined like that. All we wanted to do was go home but we couldn't because we were on an organised trip. So we stayed for the rest of the game, though our hearts weren't really in it, and at the end we just went and sat in the coach, waiting for everyone else.\" </p> <p>In response to the incident, the Football League has changed its ticketing rules so that this year no player received more than 25 tickets, a third of last year's allocation. Additionally, according to the Football Association's Steve Double, \"each of the finalists had to give a written commitment to distribute their tickets in a responsible manner\". </p> <p>This is Double-speak for players being told not to channel their tickets into the black market - although the habit of flogging them en masse to touts appears to be a hard one to kick. </p> <p>The practice was an immoral but understandable temptation in the days when relatively poorly paid players saw a Wembley final as a one-off opportunity to bolster their pension funds. Now, however, with the rewards from such spivvery minuscule in comparison with \u00a320,000-a-week wages, it is as indefensible as it is abhorrent. </p> <p>One would have thought it would have been easy enough for the authorities to make the practice untenable by sweeping touts off the streets, as happened before the England-Scotland Euro2000 play-off at Wembley. But such operations are dictated by the police, not the FA. </p> <p>After the investigation into last year's shameful scenes, the FA charged 25 Leicester City players and officials with failing to assist the inquiry. Those charges have been dropped but a total of 10 Leicester employees still face charges of misconduct on March 15: the players Steve Guppy, Neil Lennon, Tony Cottee, Andy Impey, Graham Fenton, Arnar Gunnlaugsson and Stuart Campbell, plus the chief scout Jim Melrose, the physio Ian Andrews and the youth academy director David Nish. The club's media relations officer Paul Mace underlines that \"all will be protesting their innocence most strongly\". </p> <p>Anyone who is found guilty may be banned from receiving further cup final tickets for either the next couple of years or sine die. Alternatively, according to an FA spokesman, they could escape with a slap on the wristband. Which would only add further insult to the physical and mental injuries already suffered by Lelacheur and her family.</p>",

I was more upset about seeing Megan in tears. \"She looked a right mess, when minutes before she had been such a happy little girl. She looked really lovely in this bright green cagoule and was carrying a little silver cup Jim had made for her. Even the Sky TV cameras picked her out. Day out in ruins \"It was terrible our day could have been ruined like that. All we wanted to do was go home but we couldn't because we were on an organised trip. So we stayed for the rest of the game, though our hearts weren't really in it, and at the end we just went and sat in the coach, waiting for everyone else.\" In response to the incident, the Football League has changed its ticketing rules so that this year no player received more than 25 tickets, a third of last year's allocation. Additionally, according to the Football Association's Steve Double, \"each of the finalists had to give a written commitment to distribute their tickets in a responsible manner\". This is Double-speak for players being told not to channel their tickets into the black market - although the habit of flogging them en masse to touts appears to be a hard one to kick. The practice was an immoral but understandable temptation in the days when relatively poorly paid players saw a Wembley final as a one-off opportunity to bolster their pension funds. Now, however, with the rewards from such spivvery minuscule in comparison with \u00a320,000-a-week wages, it is as indefensible as it is abhorrent. One would have thought it would have been easy enough for the authorities to make the practice untenable by sweeping touts off the streets, as happened before the England-Scotland Euro2000 play-off at Wembley. But such operations are dictated by the police, not the FA. After the investigation into last year's shameful scenes, the FA charged 25 Leicester City players and officials with failing to assist the inquiry. Those charges have been dropped but a total of 10 Leicester employees still face charges of misconduct on March 15: the players Steve Guppy, Neil Lennon, Tony Cottee, Andy Impey, Graham Fenton, Arnar Gunnlaugsson and Stuart Campbell, plus the chief scout Jim Melrose, the physio Ian Andrews and the youth academy director David Nish. The club's media relations officer Paul Mace underlines that \"all will be protesting their innocence most strongly\". Anyone who is found guilty may be banned from receiving further cup final tickets for either the next couple of years or sine die. Alternatively, according to an FA spokesman, they could escape with a slap on the wristband. Which would only add further insult to the physical and mental injuries already suffered by Lelacheur and her family.",

As if acknowledging that turning point in her career, she closed her programme with Ad\u00e8le's big act one aria, creating the same magic, laying bare the character's self-deluded sensuality with a combination of spectacular vocalism, verbal innuendo and subtle wit. </p> <p>Technically, she's staggering. Her voice - bell-like in its upper registers, warm and sweet lower down - is incredibly beautiful.

Handel's Cleopatra (from Giulio Cesare) is often portrayed as a childish sex-kitten; Massis turns her into a regal, sensual figure, and the result is revelatory. </p> <p>She's fabulous in comedy, too. A wicked smile crosses her face as she exposes the erotic yearnings of Rezia, the heroine of Gluck's Les P\u00e9lerins de la Mecque ou La Rencontre Impr\u00e9vue, the opera on which Mozart drew for II Seraglio. She presents us with Offenbach's Eurydice as an encore, hissing her resentment of Orpheus with gleeful spite. </p> <p>Throughout, Vinikour is a perfect foil. Recitals of operatic arias with piano or harpsichord accompaniment (he plays both) are tricky to get right and you tend to miss the orchestra. Vinikour - whether enveloping Rameau's Aricie in tendrils of consoling sound, or turning the prelude that heralds Semiramide's arrival into an appealing nocturne - was exemplary throughout and the absence of a band wasn't felt.</p>",

It's said she inspired in Courtney Love the \"kinderwhore\" look, and was one of the main precursors of Riot Grrrl. Garside found fame before she was ready, however, and retreated to the Lake District to bellow at the mountains for a few years. She healed herself, and came up with a collection of her own songs. </p> <p>The new material is more developed than those guttural howlings of yore, and fully fleshed out with her band, Queen Adreena. She and collaborator Crispin Gray (former Daisy Chainsaw songwriter/ guitarist) take to the stage with a theatrical sense of authority. Joined by bassist Orson Wajih and drummer Billy Freedom, they must be the best-looking band on the planet. </p> <p>Garside is dressed in a lacy pink slip and knee-length brown socks, her mike box unceremoniously strapped to her thigh with thick black tape. She shakes her long tangled hair like a demented fairy, singing metallic dream songs with bluesy intensity and smearing plum lipstick over her face. The rest of the band stand in the strobe lights, all Bowie-ish chiselled cheekbones and punk glam androgyny. Wearing a mod suit and eyeliner, Gray plays sharp, stabbing guitar, while Wajih plucks bass in a long skin-tight dress and peaked cap. Freedom just sits at the back, hitting his drums like a muscled rock monster. </p> <p>What stops this show from descending into cod Berlin cabaret is the quality of the songs. Soda Dreamer and X-ing off the Day, for instance, are an unearthly mesh of Banshee rock, jazz and Zeppelin-style riffery, while Pretty Polly is pure disembodied folk. With staring, Bambi eyes, Garside conjures up a world each time she sings. In the early 90s there was a disturbing, uncontrolled velocity to her performance, but now she appears more focused. </p> <p>For the last number the band gradually leave the stage until she is alone in the spotlight, repeating her mantra like a strange figure on a music box: \"I only make love to Jesus,\" she intones. \"I only fuck God.\" With that she slowly walks off, Freedom puts a jacket round her shoulders, and the crowd stand there stunned. There is no need for an encore.</p>",

The rest of the band stand in the strobe lights, all Bowie-ish chiselled cheekbones and punk glam androgyny. Wearing a mod suit and eyeliner, Gray plays sharp, stabbing guitar, while Wajih plucks bass in a long skin-tight dress and peaked cap. Freedom just sits at the back, hitting his drums like a muscled rock monster. What stops this show from descending into cod Berlin cabaret is the quality of the songs. Soda Dreamer and X-ing off the Day, for instance, are an unearthly mesh of Banshee rock, jazz and Zeppelin-style riffery, while Pretty Polly is pure disembodied folk. With staring, Bambi eyes, Garside conjures up a world each time she sings. In the early 90s there was a disturbing, uncontrolled velocity to her performance, but now she appears more focused. For the last number the band gradually leave the stage until she is alone in the spotlight, repeating her mantra like a strange figure on a music box: \"I only make love to Jesus,\" she intones. \"I only fuck God.\" With that she slowly walks off, Freedom puts a jacket round her shoulders, and the crowd stand there stunned. There is no need for an encore.",

One month into the job she was stressed out, miserable and seriously thinking about leaving. </p> <p>Katherine's experience is far from uncommon.

No-one is psychic and trying to be often ends in disaster.\" </p> <p>Often one of the hardest parts of a promotion if you have remained in the same department is how to re-draw relationships with colleagues.

The best way to re-define existing relationships is to have regular meetings so that they get used to seeing you in your new role. Take suggestions and ideas from them on how things could improve - make it clear that you value them highly and respect their abilities. The best way to learn all this is to go on a management training course where you can develop the skills you need.\" </p> <p>As Kevin says: \"I do feel that if I had been sent on a management course I wouldn't have made some of the mistakes that occurred.

      "body": "<p>Lloyd's of London next week comes face to face with the very last people allowed to demand a courtroom hearing for their accusations of fraud against the huge insurance market. </p> <p>More than 200 dissident investors, many of whom face bankruptcy because of their decision to become names and underwrite Lloyd's with their own assets, will try to prove that the insurance market attempted to recruit members in the 1980s but failed to let them know of billions of pounds of asbestos claims which were about to crash in and plunge the entire organisation to the brink of extinction. </p> <p>The so-called Jaffray case -named after Sir William Otho Jaffray, who is being pursued by Lloyd's for huge losses - opens on Monday at Chichester rents and should be the final showdown between the bloodied insurance market and thousands of investors who are trying to resist being ruined. All 1,650 dissident investors around the world who are still in dispute with Lloyd's have been warned by the courts that this is their last chance to allege fraud. So far only 231 have joined the Jaffray action but their Lloyd's losses alone total more than \u00a351m. </p> <p><strong> Tax breaks</strong></p> <p>In all Lloyd's is still owed \u00a3370m from those individuals who joined a market which offered magnificent tax breaks for the most affluent but at the price of having to accept unlimited liability. A former chairman of the market used to illustrate the point to new members by making them sign a blank cheque which he would then fill in with enough noughts to make most eyes water. </p> <p>The Jaffray names claim they are not trying to renege on their side of this blank cheque. What they do argue is that Lloyd's went hunting for names deliberately in order to spread the pain of about \u00a34bn of asbestos liability losses which underwriters were keeping secret in their books. </p> <p>Monday's do or die court case - expected to last for up to six months - will centre on the issue of whether Lloyd's was deliberately fraudulent or simply full of failings. The names will call as witnesses once towering figures in the London market such as Dick Outhwaite - one of the most profitable underwriters the market has seen but one whose business collapsed into the arms of rivals because of galloping liability losses. </p> <p>Even the market's most stalwart supporters acknowledge that Lloyd's was out of control to some considerable degree during the 1980s as its eventual \u00a38bn of losses mounted remorselessly. The rich who were not already members of the market were clamouring to join in the late 1970s and early 1980s because of the superlative tax breaks on offer to top earners being stung by a 98% rate of supertax. </p> <p>Lloyd's was also desperate to drum up new members in the United States to compensate for the fact that the pound was dropping against the dollar and putting the squeeze on the amount of US business the organisation could handle. </p> <p>But the real killer was the strong rise in property prices in London and the south-east. This meant that very \"ordinary\" homeowners in Islington and St John's Wood could suddenly meet Lloyd's \"wealth test\" which had been designed years earlier to deter all but the most affluent. </p> <p>By the end of the 1980s Lloyd's membership hit a peak of 34,000. But a seemingly endless stream of dodgy dealing and malpractice has surfaced in the insurance market in the past couple of decades which have threatened to extinguish the venerable institution which is a major contributor to the UK's invisible balance of payments and which has just embarked on its fourth century of operation. </p> <p>A successful fraud claim would undermine the market's entire basis of doing business - uberrima fides or utmost good faith - and kibosh its ability to compete with the new breed of global mega-insurers. </p> <p><strong> Counter claim</strong></p> <p>But the market has always seen off accusations of fraud and claims the Jaffray action is \"an accusation of last resort\". The litigation is actually a counter claim to Lloyd's attempts to recover debts from the litigants and Lloyd's says it can disprove the names' claim that a letter by former market chairman, Murray Lawrence, warning of the risks of asbestos losses was never properly circulated. Insiders say although the case has taken two years to prepare, Lloyd's will be able to show that the Jaffray case is \"peppered with inaccurancies and misinterpretations\". </p> <p>Although the names' chances of success are regarded as slim, another extensive exposure of the goings on at No 1 Lime Street will be unwelcome exposure for the new broom executive running the market. Any trawl back through the 1980s will rehash evidence of a market run by decidedly second rate people, many of whom had only the most elementary grip on rudimentary business practice. It will not be a helpful image for an organisation - now run by a 39-year-old former management consultant - and trying to promote itself as the owner of one of the world's most prestigious brand names. </p> <p>But loss for the names - 30 of whom are on legal aid - will be devastating. It is estimated that Lloyd's formidable 50-strong army of solicitors from top London law firm, Freshfields, have already clocked up costs of \u00a320m or so. </p> <p>And Lloyd's makes no secret of its determination to recover every penny - even if that means tying up Britain's bankruptcy courts for years to come. </p> <p><strong>The key players</strong></p> <p><strong> Sir Peter Green</strong> Chairman of Lloyd's in the early 1980s, who was widely discredited as his underwriting business was involved in controversial offshore reinsurance deals. An autocratic and evangelical advocate of Lloyd's. His tenure spanned one of the market's most traumatic periods when flamboyant multi-millionaires, such as Ian \"Goldfinger\" Posgate, were accused of insider dealing at the expense of investors, or Names. </p> <p><strong> Murray Lawrence</strong> An old-style underwriter who moved up from deputy chairman to chairman of the market, thus earning the distinction of being included in both roles as a defendant in the Jaffray action. He is also singled out for his now notorious \"asbestos letter\" which Lloyd's claims was distributed to underwriters to warn them of the need to check their reserves for mounting losses, but which the Jaffray Names allege was effectively a forgery and never got out of the chairman's office. </p> <p><strong> Sir Peter Miller</strong> An insurance broker who was appointed to chair Lloyd's in an attempt to usher in a new era of openness. He was largely responsible for appointing the market's first outside chief executive, Ian Hay Davison. But the two men never got on and the new spirit, which was supposed to haul Lloyd's towards the wider business practice of the late 20th century, was put on hold until Peter Middletontook over. </p> <p><strong> Richard Outhwaite</strong> At one time his syndicates were among the most popular in the Lloyd's market with Names falling over themselves for a slice of the action. Under pressure to keep so many investors happy, he ventured into uncharted areas of insurance. But when insurance rates plunged these risky policies were exposed and he could not cover the losses. Always outspoken, Outhwaite is appearing for the litigating Names in support of their claim that market insiders knew of the likely landslide of asbestos losses.</p>",

This meant that very \"ordinary\" homeowners in Islington and St John's Wood could suddenly meet Lloyd's \"wealth test\" which had been designed years earlier to deter all but the most affluent. By the end of the 1980s Lloyd's membership hit a peak of 34,000. But a seemingly endless stream of dodgy dealing and malpractice has surfaced in the insurance market in the past couple of decades which have threatened to extinguish the venerable institution which is a major contributor to the UK's invisible balance of payments and which has just embarked on its fourth century of operation. A successful fraud claim would undermine the market's entire basis of doing business - uberrima fides or utmost good faith - and kibosh its ability to compete with the new breed of global mega-insurers. Counter claim But the market has always seen off accusations of fraud and claims the Jaffray action is \"an accusation of last resort\". The litigation is actually a counter claim to Lloyd's attempts to recover debts from the litigants and Lloyd's says it can disprove the names' claim that a letter by former market chairman, Murray Lawrence, warning of the risks of asbestos losses was never properly circulated. Insiders say although the case has taken two years to prepare, Lloyd's will be able to show that the Jaffray case is \"peppered with inaccurancies and misinterpretations\". Although the names' chances of success are regarded as slim, another extensive exposure of the goings on at No 1 Lime Street will be unwelcome exposure for the new broom executive running the market. Any trawl back through the 1980s will rehash evidence of a market run by decidedly second rate people, many of whom had only the most elementary grip on rudimentary business practice. It will not be a helpful image for an organisation - now run by a 39-year-old former management consultant - and trying to promote itself as the owner of one of the world's most prestigious brand names. But loss for the names - 30 of whom are on legal aid - will be devastating. It is estimated that Lloyd's formidable 50-strong army of solicitors from top London law firm, Freshfields, have already clocked up costs of \u00a320m or so. And Lloyd's makes no secret of its determination to recover every penny - even if that means tying up Britain's bankruptcy courts for years to come. The key players Sir Peter Green Chairman of Lloyd's in the early 1980s, who was widely discredited as his underwriting business was involved in controversial offshore reinsurance deals. An autocratic and evangelical advocate of Lloyd's. His tenure spanned one of the market's most traumatic periods when flamboyant multi-millionaires, such as Ian \"Goldfinger\" Posgate, were accused of insider dealing at the expense of investors, or Names. Murray Lawrence An old-style underwriter who moved up from deputy chairman to chairman of the market, thus earning the distinction of being included in both roles as a defendant in the Jaffray action. He is also singled out for his now notorious \"asbestos letter\" which Lloyd's claims was distributed to underwriters to warn them of the need to check their reserves for mounting losses, but which the Jaffray Names allege was effectively a forgery and never got out of the chairman's office. Sir Peter Miller An insurance broker who was appointed to chair Lloyd's in an attempt to usher in a new era of openness. He was largely responsible for appointing the market's first outside chief executive, Ian Hay Davison. But the two men never got on and the new spirit, which was supposed to haul Lloyd's towards the wider business practice of the late 20th century, was put on hold until Peter Middletontook over. Richard Outhwaite At one time his syndicates were among the most popular in the Lloyd's market with Names falling over themselves for a slice of the action. Under pressure to keep so many investors happy, he ventured into uncharted areas of insurance. But when insurance rates plunged these risky policies were exposed and he could not cover the losses. Always outspoken, Outhwaite is appearing for the litigating Names in support of their claim that market insiders knew of the likely landslide of asbestos losses.",

      "byline": "Hilary Freeman",

      "body": "<p>You've got your first graduate pay cheque. Congratulations! Enjoy it while it lasts ... which won't be long. As a great Swedish philosopher once said, </p> <p>\"money, money, money, must be funny, in a rich man's world\". Ah ha. </p> <p>Graduates have never had it so good. The average starting salary for 1999 graduates was \u00a317,500, a 4.8 per cent increase on 1998 and four times the rate of inflation. This year's graduates will be taking home around \u00a318,000. </p> <p>Graduates have never had it so bad. In the good old days of full grants, free tuition and benefits, graduate debts used to reflect the amount of hours spent in the union bar (i.e. it was your own fault). No longer. Today, unless you have very rich or generous parents, you'd have to starve, alone, in a garret to escape from debt. </p> <p>According to the NUS, the average 1998 graduate left university with debts of \u00a34,500. Under the current loans system, once you start earning a salary of \u00a315,000 or above, you have to start paying back your loan. And you've only got five years to do it. </p> <p> Once you become an earner, it's time to put away childish things (combat trousers and snakebite and black) and replace them with the trappings of adulthood (suits and good wines). The problem is doing it on a graduate starting salary. No-one warns you about the expenses of working life. You've got to buy a working wardrobe and finance after-work drinks and meals. Not to mention that in order to actually earn your salary, you've got to go get to work, which means forking out for train or bus fares, or petrol money. </p> <p>Suddenly, your monthly pay cheque looks less like a winning lottery ticket and more like the miserable scrap of printed paper that it is. The good news is you've got a choice. You can either Spend! Spend! Spend! and be in debt till you're 65 or you can be sensible. </p> <p>Sensible may not be sexy (but neither is Michael Douglas and it hasn't done him any harm), but it works. Donna Bradshaw, director at independent financial advisers, Fiona Price &amp; Partners says the key to surviving on a graduate starting salary is budgeting: \"It's all too easy to run out of money before the month is up,\" she states, \"so you need to know exactly how much you have to live on and how much your bills, rent, student loans and council tax etc. will cost. </p> <p>\"Once you know, you can put the money aside. Then, if you're really clever, take out the exact amount of cash you've allowed yourself for each week and live on it. Seeing it physically disappear will make you more aware of your spending habits.\" </p> <p> Many companies offer season ticket loans as a perk. If yours is one of them, take them up on it. You'll save a substantial amount on travelling costs. Remember though, that they're treated as a benefit in kind, which means you'll pay slightly more tax. </p> <p>Getting the hang of this being sensible lark? Then why not cut back on needless spending by bringing in home-made sandwiches and drinks. Avoid ready-cooked meals for one - they're not economical. If you're really organised, Donna suggests cooking up dishes at the weekend, then separating them into portions and freezing them for consumption later in the week. </p> <p> Building a working wardrobe can be difficult at the start of your career. Many companies are taking a more relaxed attitude to dressing, but in some professions (law, accountancy) you either get suited up or booted out. Either get a job as an artist's model, work only on dress-down Fridays, or learn to shop carefully: \"The temptation is to put everything on the credit card,\" says Donna. \"But if you do that, it's all too easy to make debt a habit. Choose a few good investment pieces and if you have no choice but to get them on credit, look for cards with low interest rates.\" </p> <p>It's a perverse fact that the more credit you have, the more you can get. If you're someone for whom \"credit\" is spelt D A N G E R (that is, you see it as the ticket to fancy holidays and designer clothes) you might, Donna says, be better off with a loan. </p> <p>\"Loans are easier to manage than credit cards. You know exactly how much you'll have to pay each month and will have a set date to pay it off by. If you do have a credit card, you can ask for the limit to be reduced, so you don't find yourself on a slippery slope to even more debt.\" </p> <p> There's no shame in being less well-off than your more senior (and higher salaried) colleagues. Don't be the first person to jump in and offer to buy a round of drinks, offer to buy your own - or even suggest starting up a kitty for social occasions. \"Often, team social events happen at set times of the year, such as Christmas,\" says Donna. </p> <p>\"This means you can plan for them and save some money in advance. As for leaving collections, put in what you can afford when the envelope comes round, irrespective of other people's contributions. You're not a charity.\" </p> <p>Living on a graduate starting salary is hard, but making a few sacrifices at the start of your career is worth it in the long term.

      "bodyText": "You've got your first graduate pay cheque. Congratulations! Enjoy it while it lasts ... which won't be long. As a great Swedish philosopher once said, \"money, money, money, must be funny, in a rich man's world\". Ah ha. Graduates have never had it so good. The average starting salary for 1999 graduates was \u00a317,500, a 4.8 per cent increase on 1998 and four times the rate of inflation. This year's graduates will be taking home around \u00a318,000. Graduates have never had it so bad. In the good old days of full grants, free tuition and benefits, graduate debts used to reflect the amount of hours spent in the union bar (i.e. it was your own fault). No longer. Today, unless you have very rich or generous parents, you'd have to starve, alone, in a garret to escape from debt. According to the NUS, the average 1998 graduate left university with debts of \u00a34,500. Under the current loans system, once you start earning a salary of \u00a315,000 or above, you have to start paying back your loan. And you've only got five years to do it. Once you become an earner, it's time to put away childish things (combat trousers and snakebite and black) and replace them with the trappings of adulthood (suits and good wines). The problem is doing it on a graduate starting salary. No-one warns you about the expenses of working life. You've got to buy a working wardrobe and finance after-work drinks and meals. Not to mention that in order to actually earn your salary, you've got to go get to work, which means forking out for train or bus fares, or petrol money. Suddenly, your monthly pay cheque looks less like a winning lottery ticket and more like the miserable scrap of printed paper that it is. The good news is you've got a choice. You can either Spend! Spend! Spend! and be in debt till you're 65 or you can be sensible. Sensible may not be sexy (but neither is Michael Douglas and it hasn't done him any harm), but it works. Donna Bradshaw, director at independent financial advisers, Fiona Price &amp; Partners says the key to surviving on a graduate starting salary is budgeting: \"It's all too easy to run out of money before the month is up,\" she states, \"so you need to know exactly how much you have to live on and how much your bills, rent, student loans and council tax etc. will cost. \"Once you know, you can put the money aside. Then, if you're really clever, take out the exact amount of cash you've allowed yourself for each week and live on it. Seeing it physically disappear will make you more aware of your spending habits.\" Many companies offer season ticket loans as a perk. If yours is one of them, take them up on it. You'll save a substantial amount on travelling costs. Remember though, that they're treated as a benefit in kind, which means you'll pay slightly more tax. Getting the hang of this being sensible lark? Then why not cut back on needless spending by bringing in home-made sandwiches and drinks. Avoid ready-cooked meals for one - they're not economical. If you're really organised, Donna suggests cooking up dishes at the weekend, then separating them into portions and freezing them for consumption later in the week. Building a working wardrobe can be difficult at the start of your career. Many companies are taking a more relaxed attitude to dressing, but in some professions (law, accountancy) you either get suited up or booted out. Either get a job as an artist's model, work only on dress-down Fridays, or learn to shop carefully: \"The temptation is to put everything on the credit card,\" says Donna. \"But if you do that, it's all too easy to make debt a habit. Choose a few good investment pieces and if you have no choice but to get them on credit, look for cards with low interest rates.\" It's a perverse fact that the more credit you have, the more you can get. If you're someone for whom \"credit\" is spelt D A N G E R (that is, you see it as the ticket to fancy holidays and designer clothes) you might, Donna says, be better off with a loan. \"Loans are easier to manage than credit cards. You know exactly how much you'll have to pay each month and will have a set date to pay it off by. If you do have a credit card, you can ask for the limit to be reduced, so you don't find yourself on a slippery slope to even more debt.\" There's no shame in being less well-off than your more senior (and higher salaried) colleagues. Don't be the first person to jump in and offer to buy a round of drinks, offer to buy your own - or even suggest starting up a kitty for social occasions. \"Often, team social events happen at set times of the year, such as Christmas,\" says Donna. \"This means you can plan for them and save some money in advance. As for leaving collections, put in what you can afford when the envelope comes round, irrespective of other people's contributions. You're not a charity.\" Living on a graduate starting salary is hard, but making a few sacrifices at the start of your career is worth it in the long term. One day, you'll be be able to live the life of Riley (nice car, nice house, nice holidays), while your less careful peers are still living like students. Better go ... the bailiffs are knocking on the door.",
