Subs: Cudicini, Hogh, Sutton, Ambrosetti, Morris, Thome, Harley. </p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Knut-Erik Fisker (Denmark) </p> <p>Heavy rain has made for less than ideal conditions as Chelsea seek the win that would give them a quarter-final place. Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli has recalled Didier Deschamps and Marcel Desailly after resting them at the weekend. Albert Ferrer is ruled out with a bad back.</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Chelsea kick off and immediately hoof upfield for a goal-kick. Gentle stuff to start as the teams size each other up.<br> <strong>3 </strong> Feyenoord get the ball up on the back of a long kick by 'keeper Dudek; Thomasson holds up well in midfield before spraying it wide for Bosvelt on the right. He cuts inside but Chelsea stifle the move on the edge of the area.<br> <strong>6</strong> Chelsea come close as Zola and Poyet combine in a one-two; Zola feeds Poyet on the corner of the penalty area then picks up the return to shoots and force a save from Dudek.<br> <strong>7</strong> Chelsea follow up with a long-range strike from Flo - easy for Dudek.<br> <strong>9 Penalty to Chelsea</strong> Uproar as Van Wonderen brings down Flo when the Norwegian cuts in from the right. Leboeuf takes the spot kick but Dudek makes the save - uproar again but for the opposite reason. <br> <strong>13</strong> Leboeuf, perhaps frustrated at his miss from 12 yards, has a pop from all of 45 yards. He doesn't sky it but he doesn't score either. The crowd seem muted as the game hits a momentary lull. <br> <strong>16</strong> Wise gains possession just outside the Feyenoord area and passes for the advancing Flo to win a corner. Wise takes with Flo as the target but Dudek, after such an inpressive start, makes a complete hash of the save. He punches the ball straight up in the area and after a bout of head tennis is relieved to see Desailly head behind for a goal-kick<br> <strong>21</strong> Chelsea exposed at the back as Babayaro makes a mess of clearing a hopeful long ball by Feyenoord but Leboeuf saves the day from the advancing Van Gobbel.<br> <strong>22</strong> Feyenoord beginning to move the ball around well and create space. <br> <strong>23</strong> Feyenoord work the ball up to Thomasson who again holds up well for Bosvelt to deliver a deep cross that Van Gastel is just unable to reach.<br> <strong>28</strong> A mistake by Cruz in the Feyenoord half opens things up for Chelsea. Flo picks up the ball and feeds Petrescu on the right. He then cuts inside and passes to Zola on the edge of the area but the Italian cannot make his shot count. Wise takes the resulting corner, Dudek stays put this time as Poyet gets in a lame header from six-yards out. Rzasa, on the line, heads clear.<br> <strong>30</strong> Wise has crack from 30 yards out and forces Dudek to tip it over for a corner. Comes to nothing. Chelsea now looking equal to the task and willing to have a go at every opportunity. This has stunned the crowd into near silence.<br> <strong>33</strong> After a brief spell of smart moves and a desire to get the ball out of their own half, Feyenoord now look happy to sit back and see what Chelsea are going to do next. Continue to play high up the field probably. <br> <strong>39 Goal Feyenoord 0 - 1 Chelsea</strong> A deep ball from Wise on the half-way line is headed on for Zola to turn and shoot from just outside the penalty area. Top strike to give Chelsea a deserved lead.<br> <strong>43</strong> Zola now has his tail up as Chelsea seek to capitalise on their lead.

      "bodyText": "Feyenoord: Dudek, Rzasa, Van Wonderen, Konterman, Van Gobbel, De Visser, Paauwe, Van Gastel, Bosvelt, Tomasson, Cruz. Subs: Graafland, Gyan, Kalou, Samardzic, Van Vossen, Korneev, De Haan. Chelsea: De Goey, Babayaro, Desailly, Leboeuf, Petrescu, Poyet, Wise, Deschamps, Di Matteo, Zola, Flo. Subs: Cudicini, Hogh, Sutton, Ambrosetti, Morris, Thome, Harley. Referee: Knut-Erik Fisker (Denmark) Heavy rain has made for less than ideal conditions as Chelsea seek the win that would give them a quarter-final place. Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli has recalled Didier Deschamps and Marcel Desailly after resting them at the weekend. Albert Ferrer is ruled out with a bad back. 1 Chelsea kick off and immediately hoof upfield for a goal-kick. Gentle stuff to start as the teams size each other up. 3 Feyenoord get the ball up on the back of a long kick by 'keeper Dudek; Thomasson holds up well in midfield before spraying it wide for Bosvelt on the right. He cuts inside but Chelsea stifle the move on the edge of the area. 6 Chelsea come close as Zola and Poyet combine in a one-two; Zola feeds Poyet on the corner of the penalty area then picks up the return to shoots and force a save from Dudek. 7 Chelsea follow up with a long-range strike from Flo - easy for Dudek. 9 Penalty to Chelsea Uproar as Van Wonderen brings down Flo when the Norwegian cuts in from the right. Leboeuf takes the spot kick but Dudek makes the save - uproar again but for the opposite reason. 13 Leboeuf, perhaps frustrated at his miss from 12 yards, has a pop from all of 45 yards. He doesn't sky it but he doesn't score either. The crowd seem muted as the game hits a momentary lull. 16 Wise gains possession just outside the Feyenoord area and passes for the advancing Flo to win a corner. Wise takes with Flo as the target but Dudek, after such an inpressive start, makes a complete hash of the save. He punches the ball straight up in the area and after a bout of head tennis is relieved to see Desailly head behind for a goal-kick 21 Chelsea exposed at the back as Babayaro makes a mess of clearing a hopeful long ball by Feyenoord but Leboeuf saves the day from the advancing Van Gobbel. 22 Feyenoord beginning to move the ball around well and create space. 23 Feyenoord work the ball up to Thomasson who again holds up well for Bosvelt to deliver a deep cross that Van Gastel is just unable to reach. 28 A mistake by Cruz in the Feyenoord half opens things up for Chelsea. Flo picks up the ball and feeds Petrescu on the right. He then cuts inside and passes to Zola on the edge of the area but the Italian cannot make his shot count. Wise takes the resulting corner, Dudek stays put this time as Poyet gets in a lame header from six-yards out. Rzasa, on the line, heads clear. 30 Wise has crack from 30 yards out and forces Dudek to tip it over for a corner. Comes to nothing. Chelsea now looking equal to the task and willing to have a go at every opportunity. This has stunned the crowd into near silence. 33 After a brief spell of smart moves and a desire to get the ball out of their own half, Feyenoord now look happy to sit back and see what Chelsea are going to do next. Continue to play high up the field probably. 39 Goal Feyenoord 0 - 1 Chelsea A deep ball from Wise on the half-way line is headed on for Zola to turn and shoot from just outside the penalty area. Top strike to give Chelsea a deserved lead. 43 Zola now has his tail up as Chelsea seek to capitalise on their lead. Leboeuf feeds Zola who swiftly finds Poyet advancing on the six-yard box but Van Gobbel runs him out before he can get in a clean shot. 45 Brief worry for Chelsea as the half comes to a close. Feyenoord win a free kick to the right of the Chelsea area; comes to nothing as Feyonoord continue to display the chronic lack of ideas that has characterised their first half. Half-time with Chelsea in control. 46 Substitution Kalou on for Paauwe. Here we again. Feyenoord resume with a lot of running and look more capable of getting a result than when they went off. 48 A fine angled cross from Bosvelt finds Cruz on the edge of the Chelsea area and his sweet strike clears the bar by only a foot. 48 Chelsea win a corner, Wise takes but Konterman puts it behind for another corner. Wise takes again and plays it short to Zola before picking up the return and crossing towards Desailly on the edge of the six-yard box. Dudek gets up but drops the catch before smothering the chance. 54 Chelsea appear to have lost some of their momentum as Feyenoordturn their tactics to building from the back. 55 Feyenoord win a free-kick 45 yards out after Desailly fouls Kalou. Van Gastel has a pop and sends the ball into the crowd. 58 A little passion has made all the difference to Feyenoord's game and Chelsea's lead is now looking fragile. 59 Goal Feyenoord 1 - 1 Chelsea Chelsea stretched at the back as a whipped-in cross is palmed fractionally clear by De Goey and into the path of Kalou who manages to back-heel the ball into the net. 60 Deschamp unleashes a shot from 30 yards out and forces Dudek to make a flying save. 64 Goal Feyenoord 1 - 2 Chelsea Terrific move by Chelsea. Zola releases Babayaro down the left who races on towards the line to deliver a great cross for little big man Wise to get up and restore Chelsea's lead. 68 All to play for now as Chelsea step up a gear. 69 Goal Feyenoord 1 - 3 Chelsea Chelsea book themselves a spot in the quarter-finals and await confirmation. Flo gets clear on the right and cuts inside before unleashing a left-shot that beats Dudek at the far post. 74 Chelsea show no signs of letting this tie die down despite the fact that Feyenoord now look finished. Vialli's men happy to take their chances on the break from midfield, however, rather than push up. 75 Substitution Samardzic on for Visser 77 Substitution Morris on for Poyet. 80 Not too much to shout about as Chelsea play out their time in Rotterdam. Morris, Wise and Petrescu continue to spray balls out to Zola on the left and Flo on the right. Feyenoord seem more concerned about giving away another goal than reducing their deficit. 84 Zola begins to indulge himself with some smart, yet fruitless, moves around the Feyenoord defence. 85 Chelsea corner. Wise takes and aims for Flo again but Van Gobbel makes the clearance. 86 Feyenoord free-kick. Van Gastel takes from 45 yards out and rams it straight into the wall. Wise picks up possession and finds Di Matteo who then plays it deep to Zola on the edge of the area. He then lays it off for Flo to shoot high. 90 Substitution Ambrosetti on for Zola.

The magazine, formerly Living Marxism, claimed that Penny Marshall and Ian Williams misrepresented a headline-grabbing image of an emaciated Muslim, Fikret Alic, at the Serb-run Trnopolje camp in August 1992. Ms Marshall and Mr Williams said that LM's article, headed \"The picture that fooled the world\", amounted to a highly damaging attack upon their reputations and professional integrity. The two journalists, who were described by their counsel during the two-week trial as \"decent, honest and courageous\", were each awarded \u00a3150,000 - the maximum suggested by Mr Justice Morland - and ITN received \u00a375,000. In a joint statement after the verdict Ms Marshall and Mr Williams said: \"There was never any doubt whatsoever that the allegations made against us were both untrue and unfounded. The reports in question were filmed and presented with the professionalism and integrity that would be expected of us. \"LM was given every opportunity to retract the article and its allegations. Its decision not to do so resulted in our taking legal action in order to clear our names. \"Today's verdict and award clearly vindicates that course of action and, perhaps more importantly, gives dignity to all those who were detained in the camps.\" LM's editor, Michael Hume, and publishers Informinc (LM) Ltd and Helene Guldberg, had said during the trial that the criticism of the reporters was justified because they had deliberately selected shots of Mr Alic \"caged behind barbed wire\" at Serb-run Trnopolje camp in August 1992. ITN's editor-in-chief Richard Tait said today: \"I believe this verdict makes it a good day for British television journalism. \"It is important for many reasons: it clears the names and reputations of Penny and Ian and wholly vindicates our decision to take action against LM over the lies they told about them. \"Penny and Ian's reports of conditions at Trnopolje and Omarska were one of British television journalism's finest achievements in the last 10 years.\" Useful links ITN LM (Living Marxism) International criminal tribunal for former Yugoslavia",

      "body": "<p>First, the sensational news. I have lost half a stone; well, OK, about 6lb if you want to be picky. Now, admittedly, 6lb is less than 3% of my original weight (guesstimates on a postcard please), but it's a start. Only another 35lb to go. The news would have been even more heartening but for a weekend spent in Vienna, where gyms have barely penetrated - J\u00f6rg Haider's jogging obsession is not shared by his fellow countrymen - and every menu is a death trap. How the Viennese manage to waltz eludes me; it is a miracle they can walk. </p> <p>Everything comes soaked in butter or garlic sauce; meat - grilled, griddled, cuttled and occasionally raw - appears to be obligatory; and strudels and tortes (there should be a law against them) are a way of life. All the hard work of the past six weeks swam before my eyes - and promptly drowned. My food charts make X-certificate reading. </p> <p>But Vienna was an aberration and the fightback has begun, with boxing the latest weapon in the fitness war: more punch, less paunch. Now, there may be some who think it ridiculous that I should be trying out boxing on the health pages; shouldn't it, they might aver, be on the anti-health pages? All I can say is that this is a form of boxing (sometimes called \"boxercise\") that minimises the danger of injury: you get all the \"fun\" of boxing with none of the fury (not to mention brain damage). </p> <p>My personal trainer, Sam, and I have been sparring more or less since the beginning. He stands there with large pads on his hands, which I pummel wearing boxing gloves. He showed me how to jab with the left (if that's your weaker hand) and save your right for the bigger punches. Boxing is good exercise - with lots of leg and body movement - and an excellent way of releasing aggression. It's tiring - because you have to move and punch at the same time, so everything is being used simultaneously - but also rewarding in a way that conventional exercise isn't. </p> <p>The treadmill can, as everyone who has used a gym knows, get pretty dull, no matter how diverting the boy bands cavorting round on MTV are. Boxing provides a way of varying the exercise, interacting with someone else, and setting goals - not just increasing stamina, but becoming a better technical boxer (punching is more about body positioning than hand or arm power, and it is easy to assess how well you are doing it). </p> <p>When Sam left me for his girlfriend a couple of weeks ago, I cooked up a little scheme - to take him to a boxing gym where he could pit his skills against a proper boxer. Which is how last week we came to be standing in the ring at Jimmy McDonnell's boxing gym (slogan: \"Get fit and don't get hit\") in London's Camden Town. </p> <p>Jimmy was a world-class fighter in the late 80s, won a European championship at featherweight and fought for two world titles. He now trains some of the UK's best professional boxers, some gifted amateurs and a varied bunch who are training to get fit or to explore some mythic notion of masculinity. Women are welcome here too, by the way, and plenty show up: they enjoy the release of aggression, can learn self-defence, and are particularly attracted by kick-boxing. </p> <p> M y hope was that Jimmy would show Sam the ropes, and lots of the canvas too. But it didn't work out that way. Instead, Sam and I did all the fitness stuff, danced around the ring punching Jimmy's mitts (he would occasionally give you a friendly cuff around the head and tell you to keep your guard up) and then sparred with each other (gentle body punches only). </p> <p>We did four three-minute rounds (a workout for regulars would last 10 rounds or more; a workout for the pros could be three or four hours) and it was utterly draining. This is anaerobic (as well as aerobic) exercise: the action is so fast and unrelenting that there isn't enough oxygen for the body (at least this body) to recover. After 12 minutes I was out on my feet: I spent the last couple of minutes limply punching (nudging, actually) a punchbag. The judges made the bag the winner on points. Sam, needless to say, survived the ordeal much better. So much for revenge. </p> <p>Without necessarily donning the gloves and entering the ring, there are several things everyone can learn from boxers and apply in their own fitness regimes: </p> <p>\u0095 Discipline. Boxers may damage themselves in the ring, but on the whole they don't damage themselves outside it. \"Don't put bad oil in a good engine\" is Jimmy's dictum. Avoid drink, drugs and cigarettes, and watch your diet. (Jimmy says he has never sworn, smoked, tasted alcohol, taken drugs, or consorted with any woman other than his wife; his only vice, he says, is telling lies.) </p> <p>\u0095 Jog to build up your stamina (but check with your doctor first if you have any history of heart trouble). </p> <p>\u0095 Skipping is a good form of cardio-vascular exercise and a way of building up leg strength. </p> <p>\u0095 Try circuit training: a series of short, intensive exercises designed to get your heart rate up. These might include press-ups, lunges (taking a stride forward and letting your trailing knee almost touch the floor), squat thrusts (jumping up from a squatting position), sit-ups, skipping, and running on the spot. Spend five minutes or so warming up and stretching; then do each for 30 seconds, with 30-second rests between them; go through all the routines twice, so that your heart rate is raised for around 20 minutes in all. This combination of exercises combines aerobics with resistance work, needs no equipment, and can be done in the privacy of your bedroom. </p> <p>\u0095 Put the theme from Rocky on your CD player, and shadow box in front of your bedroom mirror. It will raise your heart rate and teach you to be light on your feet. You will look ridiculous, but who cares? After all, nobody ever laughs at Lennox Lewis.</p> <p> \u0095 Stephen Moss is spending three months working out at Matt Roberts at One, 1 Aldwych, London WC2 (0171-300 0600).

      "body": "<p>Insomniacs know all there is to know about broken promises. Gadget catalogues slide from between the pages of Sunday supplements offering miracle pillows, orthopedic beds, life-changing humidifiers and CD compilations of soporific seashore noises - all lucrative for their manufacturers but not noticeably relieving the agonies of the estimated 10m British adults who suffer from sleeplessness. Just trying to plough through the proliferating and near-identical volumes of self-help literature on the subject ought to induce slumber, but even that's not foolproof. This, after all, is the paradox of sleep: the more energy you focus on eliminating the problem, the harder it becomes to reach a goal you can only reach by forgetting that you want it. </p> <p>Which is why we should offer a decidedly cautious welcome to the latest \"revolution\" in sleep treatment. But a welcome nonetheless, because Sonata - the appropriately restful tradename for a new drug launched in the UK later this week by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories - really does appear to bring us significantly closer to the \"sleep on demand\" craved by the nation's tossing and turning hordes. </p> <p>Traditional sleeping pills - benzodiazepines like Valium - launch an all-out assault on the insomniac's nervous system, guaranteeing a night's sleep but causing collateral damage in the form of next-day grogginess, a nasty reaction with alcohol and, above all, the prospect of dangerous dependency. Sonata, according to its makers and promising pre-launch clinical trials, behaves more like the fabled smart missile, targeting the relevant part of the brain, then breaking down and leaving the body swiftly - doing away with next-day side-effects and, as far as researchers are currently aware, with dependency. Crucially, in consequence, it can be taken in the middle of the night, when sleeplessness strikes, anytime up to four hours before you plan to rise. In the arcane jargon of sleep research, the drug \"preserves the natural sleep architecture\". </p> <p>To its credit, Wyeth has resisted the temptation to slap a heartstopping price tag on Sonata: GPs' budgets will only pay \u00a33.60 for every two weeks of treatment prescribed. This is not a display of selfless generosity on the part of a pharmaceuticals firm - that really would be revolutionary - but instead reflects the manufacturer's certainty of reaching an enormous, and enormously profitable, mass market: 50% of Britons suffer disrupted sleep, 24% of them frequently; the company further claims that \"around a third of patients consulting their GPs are dissatisfied with their sleep\". </p> <p>It's a surprisingly youthful market, too, given that sleep problems are traditionally associated with older people.

      "bodyText": "Insomniacs know all there is to know about broken promises. Gadget catalogues slide from between the pages of Sunday supplements offering miracle pillows, orthopedic beds, life-changing humidifiers and CD compilations of soporific seashore noises - all lucrative for their manufacturers but not noticeably relieving the agonies of the estimated 10m British adults who suffer from sleeplessness. Just trying to plough through the proliferating and near-identical volumes of self-help literature on the subject ought to induce slumber, but even that's not foolproof. This, after all, is the paradox of sleep: the more energy you focus on eliminating the problem, the harder it becomes to reach a goal you can only reach by forgetting that you want it. Which is why we should offer a decidedly cautious welcome to the latest \"revolution\" in sleep treatment. But a welcome nonetheless, because Sonata - the appropriately restful tradename for a new drug launched in the UK later this week by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories - really does appear to bring us significantly closer to the \"sleep on demand\" craved by the nation's tossing and turning hordes. Traditional sleeping pills - benzodiazepines like Valium - launch an all-out assault on the insomniac's nervous system, guaranteeing a night's sleep but causing collateral damage in the form of next-day grogginess, a nasty reaction with alcohol and, above all, the prospect of dangerous dependency. Sonata, according to its makers and promising pre-launch clinical trials, behaves more like the fabled smart missile, targeting the relevant part of the brain, then breaking down and leaving the body swiftly - doing away with next-day side-effects and, as far as researchers are currently aware, with dependency. Crucially, in consequence, it can be taken in the middle of the night, when sleeplessness strikes, anytime up to four hours before you plan to rise. In the arcane jargon of sleep research, the drug \"preserves the natural sleep architecture\". To its credit, Wyeth has resisted the temptation to slap a heartstopping price tag on Sonata: GPs' budgets will only pay \u00a33.60 for every two weeks of treatment prescribed. This is not a display of selfless generosity on the part of a pharmaceuticals firm - that really would be revolutionary - but instead reflects the manufacturer's certainty of reaching an enormous, and enormously profitable, mass market: 50% of Britons suffer disrupted sleep, 24% of them frequently; the company further claims that \"around a third of patients consulting their GPs are dissatisfied with their sleep\". It's a surprisingly youthful market, too, given that sleep problems are traditionally associated with older people. GPs are reporting anecdotal evidence of a significant increase in the proportion of insomniac patients under 40. A key prob able reason is the growth of the 24-hour society and the flexible working it demands. Studies have shown that 65% of people who frequently alternate between day and nightshifts suffer from disrupted sleep patterns. Sonata may well live up to its promise, but it will be breaking the mould if it does. \"Just about every other sleep drug introduced onto the market in the last 20 years has claimed to be better than anything else, and to have no side-effects, so one has to be cautious,\" says Professor Jim Horne of the sleep research centre at Loughborough University, and a maverick in the field. Our troubled relationship with sleeping pills, Horne argues, stems less from a lack of innovations in the lab than from some fundamental misunderstandings about who should use them and how they really work. \"Most insomniacs don't complain of sleepiness during the day, so though they find wakefulness at night upsetting, they don't actually need more sleep than they're getting,\" he says. \"There's a category of insomnia that is associated with feeling worn out all day, but those people don't respond to sleeping tablets anyway.\" Even when they do work, the medications function not so much by bringing on sleep as by reducing anxiety - in other contexts, benzodiazepines are used as tranquilisers - making the failure to fall asleep seem less distressing.

There is a rhythm to the seasons, night follows day, tides ebb and flood and a woman's body goes through a menstrual cycle every 28 days or so until the menopause sets in. That is the way it has always been and we assume it will forever stay. </p> <p>But does it have to be so? Or are we needlessly imprisoned by our and our doctors' assumptions about what is natural? Modern woman has nearly three times as many periods as her forebears endured, and evidence is accumulating that the toll of all this menstruation may not only be nuisance and distressing mood swings, but also an increased propensity to some diseases. </p> <p>The first myth is that modern menstruation patterns are natural. In an article in the latest Lancet medical journal, Charlotte Ellertson and Sarah Thomas, based in the Mexico office of the population council, write that times have changed: \"Women in pre-historic times, as estimated by research among contemporary hunter-gatherer populations, probably had far fewer periods (about 160 ovulations over their lifetime) than modern women.\" </p> <p>Women living in industrialised countries today begin menstruating at an earlier age and go through the menopause later. They limit their families to two or three children and scarcely breastfeed, Ellertson and Thomas say, \"three months per birth, with half of American infants never breastfed at all\". So their bodies get very little break from menstruation, with its hormonal surges and the physical stress on the ovary each time a ripe egg bursts through the wall. Modern woman can expect to go through about 450 periods in her life. </p> <p>So it can be argued that women are living an unnatural life - a sophisticated life of our own choosing, thanks to modern contraception, but one which leads to an unnatural number of periods. Some women are relatively undisturbed by their monthly bleed. Some welcome it as a sign of their fertility or as proof that they are not pregnant. But for some, periods are painful and debilitating - the \"curse\" of generations of women. </p> <p>The Lancet article argues that \"there is plenty of modern evidence that amenhorrhoea (absence of periods) is often healthier than the alternative\". A woman who is not ovulating escapes the sharp changes in hormone levels that can lead to mood swings. Arthritis, epilepsy and other conditions that worsen with the cycle would remain stable. Menstruation can cause endometriosis and anaemia. </p> <p>But most alarming is probably the link with ovarian cancer, explored in the current New Yorker magazine which, coincidentally with the Lancet, has taken a radical look at menstruation and the pill. Ovulation, it points out, encourages cell division as the breach in the ovary wall caused by the release of the egg is healed. Studies have shown that a woman's lifetime risk of ovarian cancer drops by 10% every time she has a child. </p> <p>\"Why? Possibly because, between nine months of pregnancy and the suppression of ovulation associated with breastfeeding, she stops ovulating for 12 months and saves her ovarian walls from 12 bouts of cell division,\" says the article. </p> <p>The same argument applies to the changes in the lining of the womb, potentially increasing the chances of endometrial cancer, which, together with ovarian cancer, is a characteristically modern disease, the consequence, in part, \"of a century in which women have come to menstruate 400 times a lifetime,\" it continues. </p> <p>Dr Sheldon Segal, a distinguished endocrinologist, well-known contraceptive researcher, and co-author of Is Menstruation Obsolete?, agrees with this scenario. \"The evidence is very clear\", he says, for the impact of menstruation on ovarian and endometrial cancer, although the jury is still out on the possibility that it might be implicated in breast cancer. \"Among women who take oral contraceptives, they reduce their risk of ovarian cancer by one seventh,\" he said. </p> <p>But they still have periods, don't they? Well no, they don't. Not a menstrual period in the proper sense of the words. What they have is a superficial bleed, which is not the same thing. There is no ovulation. This is the irony that the New Yorker hooks into. That for women on the pill, that bleed is not necessary. </p> <p>It was devised by a pioneer of the pill, John Rock, who thought that if women took 21 pills and then seven placebos, enabling them to have this non-functional bleed which seemed like a period, then the Catholic church might approve the pill as a \"natural\" form of contraception which did not interfere with the normal rhythms of life. All it did, he argued, was extend the natural, infertile, \"safe\" period. </p> <p>Of course, the argument was kicked into touch by John Rock's church. But the pill continued to be made and marketed in the pseudo-natural way he had devised. It may be that many women feel better about taking the pill knowing that their body has a week's break, but in fact, argue today's scientists, it makes very little difference. \"We have never had any reason why there is a need for a rest,\" said Dr Segal. \"It was more of a means of selling the idea to women rather than there being a medicinal basis for three weeks on and one week off.\" </p> <p>For all that he, and the Lancet writers, are challenging the orthodoxy, Dr Segal says he is not urging all women to take the pill continuously and give up periods for good. \"I do see it as a possibility that women will want to have fewer periods as a lifestyle choice, but I'm not really urging women to do this if they have no problem with their menstruation. But when it stands in the way of their normal functioning, women should be given the opportunity to decide for themselves.\" </p> <p>Ellertson agrees. Speaking from the labour ward of a hospital in Mexico where she was about to give birth she said: \"I don't think women would want to use the pill for decades on end - probably just for a few months and then have a break. But there is no evidence that the placebos do anything good.\" </p> <p> Some women have been aware that they can take two packets of pills in a row to avoid a period interrupting a special event, such as a holiday. But they have a sense that they are doing something irregular and possibly damaging. It is also, says Dr Segal, only a certain group of women who generally are that well informed. \"In the United States, that wisdom is mainly available to middle-class women with their own private physician,\" he said. And not all doctors or family planning clinics would give that advice. </p> <p>Ellertson and Thomas, who say women who think they are maintaining a natural cycle on the pill \"are being duped\", think women should be given the information so they can decide what sort of menstrual pattern suits them. \"Women could use pills to adjust their cycles as convenient,\" they suggest. In the future, they say, \"women most harmed by their cycles might choose to suppress their periods for years at a time. Others might simply reduce their annual number of bleeds.\" </p> <p>For all the regular scare stories about the pill in the UK, it is one of the best-studied drugs in medicine, she points out. Women whose periods distress or damage them should be told there is that option. </p> <p>\"Health professionals and women ought to view menstruation as they would any other naturally occurring but frequently undesirable condition,\" she writes in the Lancet. \"This means providing those women who want it with safe and effective means to eliminate their menstrual cycles, contributing to happier, less encumbered lives and helping women individually and society as a whole.\"</p>",

The other day, I let out a huge burp in a crowded lift at work, and wanted to die of embarrassment. I feel so bloated that none of my trousers or skirts do up. I've tried a glass of milk at night, and hot water after my meals, but it hasn't helped at all. Any advice? </p> <p><strong> A:</strong> You are not alone. Around 40% of the British population get heartburn and acid regurgitation (known in medi-speak as gastro-oesophageal reflux disease or GORD). The problem occurs because the sphincter that lies at the bottom of the oesophagus relaxes temporarily and lets acid from the stomach flow back up the oesophagus. This causes burning behind the breastbone as it washes up the oesophagus, an acid taste in the mouth and excess gas, which accounts for the burping and bloating.</p> <p> The first step is to cut down excessive alcohol, fatty foods and smoking, all of which can exacerbate the reflux. A lot of people find out the hard way which foods to avoid; tomatoes, citrus fruit, pickles and hot curries are common culprits. Stress triggers heartburn in some people and stress management techniques such as yoga may be very effective. You can buy drugs that neutralise acid, such as Gaviscon, and others that block acid, such as Tagamet or Zantac over the counter. But the drugs that switch off acid production in the stomach, such as Losec, are only available on prescription, so a visit to the GP may be worthwhile. If you don't get better with treatment, or have additional symptoms such as weight loss, difficulty swallowing, or passing blood in your stool, you'll be referred for a test to look inside your oesophagus and stomach (endoscopy). </p> <p><strong> Embarrassing nails</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> My toenails are disgusting; discoloured, crumbly, yellow and thick. I'm embarrassed to take my socks and shoes off even in the height of summer and have stopped going swimming - which I used to enjoy. My GP gave me some stuff to paint on the nails which didn't do anything at all. Is there any hope?</p> <p> <strong> A:</strong> The first step is to head back to the GP and ask for nail clippings to be taken and sent to a good lab to see which fungal strains you're harbouring in those nails. The drugs terbinafine (Lamisil) or itraconazole (Sporanox) daily for three months can work wonders. Your GP can also refer you to a podiatrist for nail care, and a dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis and advice about treatment. </p> <p><strong> Diet misery</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> I've been on a strict but well-balanced diet since January. I have lost 10lbs and everyone tells me I've never looked better. But I feel totally fed up. Could I be missing out on some vital vitamin?</p> <p> <strong>A:</strong> Researchers in Oxford have recently published a controlled experiment showing that dieting makes everyone unhappy even if they've never been depressed before. Women who have been depressed in the past get particularly low if they diet. In answer to your question, it seems to be the dip in blood levels of the chemical trytophan that makes you miserable when you diet. Tryptophan is processed in the body to make serotonin, the chemical in the brain that transmits \"happy\" messages. Many antidepressants, such as Prozac, work by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain. There doesn't seem to be any evidence as to whether you get used to the tryptophan dip if you maintain your diet over a long period, or whether taking trytophan supplements would counteract the depressing effects of dieting. Perhaps just knowing about the tryptophan effect will make you feel less miserable. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help.

There doesn't seem to be any evidence as to whether you get used to the tryptophan dip if you maintain your diet over a long period, or whether taking trytophan supplements would counteract the depressing effects of dieting. Perhaps just knowing about the tryptophan effect will make you feel less miserable. \u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help. If you have a question for Dr Robinson, email drann@dircon.co.uk or write to her c/o The Health Editor, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER.

Since the Institute for Public Policy Research established its commission on the future of these arrangements we have been accused at one and the same time of wanting to privatise the NHS and to scrap the private finance initiative (PFI). </p> <p>Confusion abounds; it is hard to have an open and honest debate over this most important question facing our public services. </p> <p>Take PFI. Two principal arguments have been put forward. It was said that under the right circumstances letting contracts to the private sector to build or do up hospitals and schools could yield efficiency savings and so better value for public money allocated to delivering health, education and other public services. Secondly, PFI was hailed as a way of allowing the government to reconcile its wish to spend more on capital investment with its commitment to keep a tight fiscal stance - by moving capital spending \"off-balance sheet\". </p> <p>The first of these arguments remains strong. It is the second that has never quite held up. For the period covered by the Labour government's first comprehensive spending review (from April 1999 to March 2002) the PFI will account for about \u00a311bn of investment or 14% of total publicly-sponsored capital spending. Is it really the case that this investment could not have taken place without the existence of the PFI (which Labour inherited from the Major government)? </p> <p>In fact the treasury's fiscal rules could be easily satisfied without the PFI. By definition the golden rule adopted by Gordon Brown allows the government to borrow for investment and so automatically allows, for example, a hospital to be built using funds raised through conventional public borrowing rather than through the PFI. </p> <p>Mr Brown's sustainable investment rule requires that the net ratio of public debt to national income should be below 40% of GDP over the economic cycle. What would have been the implications for this rule of abolishing PFI as part of the spending review in 1999, so that the \u00a311bn of PFI capital spending over 1999-2002 had been replaced by normal public sector capital spending? </p> <p>The answer is that the net debt-GDP ratio would still have fallen below 40% in 1999-2000. By the likely end of this parliament it would indeed have dropped to 36.4%. In other words, if PFI had been abolished and the same capital spending had been undertaken through normal public spending channels, the sustainable investment rule would have been satisfied along with the chancellor's golden rule. The treasury's new fiscal framework is entirely compatible with not having the PFI. Here is an initiative that turns out not to be necessary to secure prudent public finances. </p> <p>An important point to emphasise is that under PFI the public sector is still left to pay for the assets being built and the services being provided. (Things are different if there is a dedicated stream of charges from the users of a new facility, such as a toll bridge, for example). A sequence of public payments has thus had to be set aside to meet the commitments resulting from PFI contracts. In 2004-5 the government will be spending \u00a33.6bn a year servicing such contracts. </p> <p>The national audit office has audited a number of PFI projects, asking whether they do offer the public value for its money. These seem to show that there are savings from PFI; future savings may total as much as 20% on aver age when compared with the public sector option. However, the NAO's audits include two PFI schemes involving big information technology investments. </p> <p>If they are excluded, estimated savings fall to about 10%. This sort of level of savings was also arrived at by consultants Arthur Andersen in their report for the treasury's own PFI taskforce. When Arthur Andersen investigated a larger sample of PFI schemes, they found that an average saving of 17% might be achieved. </p> <p>We thus have estimates for possible future savings from PFI ranging from 10 to 20%. From this we can calculate the \"true\" contribution of PFI to the public finances. On the basis that the government will be spending \u00a33.6bn in 2004-5 to service PFI contracts, this much-vaunted initiative will turn out to yield savings to the taxpayer of between \u00a3360m and \u00a3720m a year (although this does not include gains achieved by avoiding cost overruns). </p> <p>That is not as much as was hoped. That fact does not of course mean PFI is a bad idea, only that we need to be clear why we have it rather than alternatives. The rationale is not \"off balance sheet\" spending (it is not) but better value for public money spent - justified as part of a wider agenda for modernising and improving the quality of public services. Increasingly - in its defence - this is what the treasury itself has been emphasising. </p> <p>Labour made changes to PFI, including guaranteeing that the pay and conditions of staff will not be harmed if they are transferred to private companies under PFI contracts. These are welcome. But the government should be more explicit about exactly why we have the PFI. </p> <p>Since it is clear that the treasury now accepts much of the above why does chancellor Brown not make an explicit statement saying PFI is really about securing significant if not spectacular increments in the value of public spending on services?

For the last 25 years, the number of heart operations - such as life-saving bypass surgery - has been rising by around 1,000 a year.

Every heart operation gives hope to someone who goes to bed each night wondering whether they will wake up. Often they don't: thousands of people in Britain are waiting for heart surgery, and each year a large number of them die before they get to the operating table.</p> <p>It is difficult to imagine anything more distressing than being told by your doctor that you have a life-threatening heart condition which requires immediate surgery - but that you must wait a year for an appointment. And even then, your operation may be cancelled on the day you turn up to hospital. Some heart patients wait more than 18 months for treatment. </p> <p>Britain does far too few heart operations - around half the European average. Partly it is because we have far too few heart surgeons - far fewer than any other European country, when adjusted for population. The government is hoping to recruit more, and has given a little money for it.</p> <p>But the report by the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons shows the problem is a lot deeper than that. The reason that the number of operations fell is not because the number of heart surgeons fell, but because each heart surgeon did less. In the words of the report's authors, they were left \"twiddling their thumbs\".</p> <p>This enforced inactivity is because of the shortage of high-cost, high-maintenance intensive care beds. You can't do a heart operation and then just leave the patient on a trolley in the corridor. </p> <p>The number of intensive care beds has fallen under Labour, as it did under the Tories. It's all in the name of \"efficiency savings\" which see empty beds as a waste of resources. At one point this winter, there was only one empty intensive care bed in the whole of the UK. That meant that all non-emergency operations had to be cancelled. Poor Maevis Skeet hit the headlines when the lack of beds meant her operation was cancelled so many times that her cancer became inoperable. Patients with life-threatening conditions were being driven hundreds of miles across the country in search of a bed - and sometimes they arrived dead.</p> <p>So that is New Labour's modern NHS. The party elected on a promise to save the NHS is patently failing to do so. What it has delivered is endless spin. Like almost all health scare stories, what this boils down to is lack of money. In Britain we spend around half the amount on health care we need to. Until the shortfall is rectified - and whatever the wafflings of Gordon Brown and Tony Blair there is virtually no chance they will do so - this government's promises on the NHS - like last week's on heart disease - will be so much hot air.</p>",

He came up with the idea in 1996 while working at a small internet consultancy in London. The concept is that people are too busy to plan ahead and so always arranged something at the last minute.

Just as Amazon was the first internet company to hit public consciousness in the US so Lastminute has been the first to do so in the UK.

The reasoning is that because they were first, they could dominate their markets. The problem is that a good internet idea is easy to copy. Cheap plane tickets can now be had from sites such as Easyjet, Ryanair and Go, so the bargains at Lastminute are no longer that terrific.</p> <p><b>So is Lastminute heading for trouble?</b><br> Possibly. Another problem with Lastminute's present value, is that it will be hard for the company to make profits on a sufficient scale to warrant its current share price. Once investors realise this, Lastminute can expect to see its share price to drop. Thousands of car companies competed with each other, when cars first appeared on the market.

      "body": "<p>Fidelity, the UK's largest independent seller of equity-based ISAs and second largest unit trust/OEIC manager with a range of 35 onshore funds, has won the award for best customer service on a financial services internet site.</p> <p>Worldwide, Fidelity is the largest independent fund management organisation with over \u00a3536bn under management for more than 15m clients. It was set up in the UK in 1979, becoming the first company to go into the Pep market in 1987 and, later, one of the first to offer Isas.</p> <p>Fidelity launched its website in 1996, since which time it has been revised several times with the aim of making it increasingly comfortable for customers to find their way around and use to make transactions quickly and efficiently. </p> <p>Executive director Paul Kafka says: \"Our aim has always been to convince customers that their business is best handled through Fidelity. To achieve that we have invested heavily for the past seven years in technology, more recently in internet technology and that commitment is ongoing. It's an essential part of building trust between us and the customers. We are huge believers that the internet is the key to giving customers the power to control their own finances both now and in the future and our objective is to achieve that more and more comprehensively.\"</p> <p>An important point of change for Fidelity and its customers was April 6 last year when the government, for the first time, gave the go ahead for investors to open and operate Isas by electronic signature. Now individual investors can open an Isa from scratch via Fidelity's website and, thereafter, access and operate their account 24 hours a day, seven days a week using its state-of-the-art WebXpress Service.</p> <p>\"This facility allows customers to control their investment portfolio online, effectively letting them set up their own individual website,\" Mr Kafka says. \"They can, for example, analyse their portfolio, breaking it down by sector geographically or by asset type, do 'what if' scenarios, switch funds, top up their investments and withdraw funds.\"</p> <p>On the security front, Mr Kafka says the encryption system Fidelity employs on its website is the most secure on the market. \"You are more secure making investments with plastic cards over the web with us than you are, for example, giving your card number over the phone to buy cinema or theatre tickets.\"</p> <p>The Fidelity site also gives customers access to online educative texts explaining the basics of Isas, building a portfolio and so on. Customers also check the price of any fund in the market through the FundScope facility.</p> <p>The latest project is to launch a one-stop-shop Investment Supermarket via the site later this year where investors will be able to review funds across the whole market, buying and selling online as they wish with a discount on unit purchases.</p> <p>Around 30,000 of Fidelity's 1m UK customers now operate their accounts online and that number is growing fast with one in five Isas now opened online. Behind the scenes, some 1,100 staff in systems and customer support serve Fidelity's web-based customers.</p> <p>\"Everything we've done technologically speaking, we have done before our competitors,\" Mr Kafka says. \"We've tried to raise the technological standard across the market place and we've tried to stay ahead in terms of simplicity of language, design and ease of making transactions.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fidelity, the UK's largest independent seller of equity-based ISAs and second largest unit trust/OEIC manager with a range of 35 onshore funds, has won the award for best customer service on a financial services internet site. Worldwide, Fidelity is the largest independent fund management organisation with over \u00a3536bn under management for more than 15m clients. It was set up in the UK in 1979, becoming the first company to go into the Pep market in 1987 and, later, one of the first to offer Isas. Fidelity launched its website in 1996, since which time it has been revised several times with the aim of making it increasingly comfortable for customers to find their way around and use to make transactions quickly and efficiently. Executive director Paul Kafka says: \"Our aim has always been to convince customers that their business is best handled through Fidelity. To achieve that we have invested heavily for the past seven years in technology, more recently in internet technology and that commitment is ongoing. It's an essential part of building trust between us and the customers. We are huge believers that the internet is the key to giving customers the power to control their own finances both now and in the future and our objective is to achieve that more and more comprehensively.\" An important point of change for Fidelity and its customers was April 6 last year when the government, for the first time, gave the go ahead for investors to open and operate Isas by electronic signature. Now individual investors can open an Isa from scratch via Fidelity's website and, thereafter, access and operate their account 24 hours a day, seven days a week using its state-of-the-art WebXpress Service. \"This facility allows customers to control their investment portfolio online, effectively letting them set up their own individual website,\" Mr Kafka says. \"They can, for example, analyse their portfolio, breaking it down by sector geographically or by asset type, do 'what if' scenarios, switch funds, top up their investments and withdraw funds.\" On the security front, Mr Kafka says the encryption system Fidelity employs on its website is the most secure on the market. \"You are more secure making investments with plastic cards over the web with us than you are, for example, giving your card number over the phone to buy cinema or theatre tickets.\" The Fidelity site also gives customers access to online educative texts explaining the basics of Isas, building a portfolio and so on. Customers also check the price of any fund in the market through the FundScope facility. The latest project is to launch a one-stop-shop Investment Supermarket via the site later this year where investors will be able to review funds across the whole market, buying and selling online as they wish with a discount on unit purchases. Around 30,000 of Fidelity's 1m UK customers now operate their accounts online and that number is growing fast with one in five Isas now opened online. Behind the scenes, some 1,100 staff in systems and customer support serve Fidelity's web-based customers. \"Everything we've done technologically speaking, we have done before our competitors,\" Mr Kafka says. \"We've tried to raise the technological standard across the market place and we've tried to stay ahead in terms of simplicity of language, design and ease of making transactions.\"",

      "body": "<p>The fierce spat between President Bill Clinton and US gun-lovers will not impress election-year voters or have much impact on the appalling death toll on America's streets and increasingly, in its schools.</p> <p>Mr Clinton clashed with the National Rifle Association - the main pro-gun lobby - after the NRA's executive vice-president, Wayne LaPierre, accused him on Sunday of deliberately tolerating gun violence. Mr Clinton and Al Gore, the Democrats' chosen candidate in this November's presidential poll, were \"willing to accept a certain level of killing to further [their] political agenda,\" he claimed. In Wayne's world, it is people, not guns, who pose the menace to public safety. And anyway, argues the NRA, existing gun control laws are not fully enforced.</p> <p>An angry Mr Clinton replied that he was \"just trying to keep more people alive... The NRA's main mission in life seems to be to stop any kind of collective action that will help us keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children.\" In Bill's world, the Republican-controlled congress, heavily lobbied by the NRA, is at fault for refusing to enact legislation designed to restrict firearms availability.</p> <p>The NRA's central charge against the White House is insulting and unfair. But in a broad sense, both Mr LaPierre and Mr Clinton are right. In a society which tolerates, indeed encourages, state-sanctioned violence, it is difficult to persuade people that guns are not a legitimate form of self-defence in the hands of responsible individuals (as the US constitution avers).</p> <p>Since 1976, when the supreme court reinstated the death penalty, more than 600 people have been executed in the US. Approximately 3,600 languish on death row. Despite a protest campaign led by Amnesty International, roughly 75% of Americans still back capital punishment.</p> <p>George Bush, the Republican candidate this November, has led the way in sanctioning judicial killings. In Texas, where Mr Bush is governor, 120 people have been put to death since he took office in 1995. Mr Gore also favours the death penalty.</p> <p>The sometimes extreme gun violence portrayed on American television; and incidents such as that in New York - where an unarmed man was gunned down recently in a hail of 19 bullets fired by police who were later acquitted of wrongdoing - also indirectly accustom and condition the public to use of guns. When it comes to controlling and renouncing violence, most US states, most law enforcers, and most of America's national leaders, set a poor example.</p> <p>But Mr Clinton is right, too. Although he has done little of any practical import to encourage gun control in his eight years in office, congress has been sitting on a modest set of proposals to impose some limits (restricting gun show sales and introducing child-proof safety triggers) since last year. The prime reason for congressional inaction lies with the support, financial and electoral, which many members receive from the gun lobby.</p> <p>In the meantime, there have been tragedies such as the recent fatal shooting in Michigan of a six-year-old girl, Kayla Rolland, by a same-age classmate. Asked why he did it, her assailant said: \"Well, that kinda thing happens on TV.\" Everybody deplores such horrors; but nothing much changes.</p> <p>Violence, official and unofficial, is endemic in US society. To eradicate it will take an effort of will by all Americans. Gun control is becoming a hot issue in this year's presidential campaign. Voters should also apply pressure to those running for the senate and the house of representatives. Reform demands a change of heart across the board - including making the connection with America's continuing, shaming use of the death penalty.</p> <p>A war of words between the president and the NRA may grab the headlines. But it will not end the killing.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/usguns\">Special report: guns in the US</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.nra.org/\" target=\"_new\">National Rifle Association</a></p>",

In Wayne's world, it is people, not guns, who pose the menace to public safety. And anyway, argues the NRA, existing gun control laws are not fully enforced. An angry Mr Clinton replied that he was \"just trying to keep more people alive... The NRA's main mission in life seems to be to stop any kind of collective action that will help us keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children.\" In Bill's world, the Republican-controlled congress, heavily lobbied by the NRA, is at fault for refusing to enact legislation designed to restrict firearms availability. The NRA's central charge against the White House is insulting and unfair. But in a broad sense, both Mr LaPierre and Mr Clinton are right. In a society which tolerates, indeed encourages, state-sanctioned violence, it is difficult to persuade people that guns are not a legitimate form of self-defence in the hands of responsible individuals (as the US constitution avers). Since 1976, when the supreme court reinstated the death penalty, more than 600 people have been executed in the US. Approximately 3,600 languish on death row. Despite a protest campaign led by Amnesty International, roughly 75% of Americans still back capital punishment. George Bush, the Republican candidate this November, has led the way in sanctioning judicial killings. In Texas, where Mr Bush is governor, 120 people have been put to death since he took office in 1995. Mr Gore also favours the death penalty. The sometimes extreme gun violence portrayed on American television; and incidents such as that in New York - where an unarmed man was gunned down recently in a hail of 19 bullets fired by police who were later acquitted of wrongdoing - also indirectly accustom and condition the public to use of guns. When it comes to controlling and renouncing violence, most US states, most law enforcers, and most of America's national leaders, set a poor example. But Mr Clinton is right, too. Although he has done little of any practical import to encourage gun control in his eight years in office, congress has been sitting on a modest set of proposals to impose some limits (restricting gun show sales and introducing child-proof safety triggers) since last year. The prime reason for congressional inaction lies with the support, financial and electoral, which many members receive from the gun lobby. In the meantime, there have been tragedies such as the recent fatal shooting in Michigan of a six-year-old girl, Kayla Rolland, by a same-age classmate. Asked why he did it, her assailant said: \"Well, that kinda thing happens on TV.\" Everybody deplores such horrors; but nothing much changes. Violence, official and unofficial, is endemic in US society. To eradicate it will take an effort of will by all Americans. Gun control is becoming a hot issue in this year's presidential campaign. Voters should also apply pressure to those running for the senate and the house of representatives. Reform demands a change of heart across the board - including making the connection with America's continuing, shaming use of the death penalty. A war of words between the president and the NRA may grab the headlines. But it will not end the killing. Special report: guns in the US National Rifle Association",

It's not enough, that is, if everyone knows you are not just Cherie Blair, mother-of-three-with-another-on-the-way, but also Cherie Booth QC. Never mind that she has been skilful in avoiding all conceivable conflicts of interest and keeping the two parts of her life separate.</p> <p>And talk about good manners! Just think of all the times you or I would have had to say something and she's had to bite her tongue. But even when she's on her very best behaviour (and when I think back on the past three years, I can't think of a single instance when she wasn't), she still manages to get an awful lot of people terribly upset. She upsets people just by being there. In a survey last month, it emerged that many ordinary women saw her as a negative role model because she was coming across as too careerist. She implied by her example that it was OK to be a workaholic. They implied that she didn't spend enough time with her family.</p> <p>So you'd think they would be happy when she decided to accompany her husband on his state visit to Moscow. But this, too, turned into an \"episode\" after her half-sister, Lauren Booth, told Michael Parkinson on Radio 2 that she was yet again setting a bad example for political wives world-wide. Wasn't it about time, Lauren said, that \"MPs stopped dragging their wives abroad? There's a lady here who's 44 years old, seven months pregnant, three kids at home, prime minister for a husband and she's supposed to go to Russia to watch some boring ballet.\"</p> <p>Asked if her sister might, like other politicians' wives, be there because she wanted to be there, Lauren blurted: \"But these are wheeled out like little cakes at the side of prime ministers across the world. Haven't we grown out of this trophy wife thing?\" As usual, Cherie Booth's response was to remain stoically silent. But her friends and allies were outraged by this implied slur and quick to point out that no one deserved the trophy wife label less.</p> <p>I couldn't agree more. I am perplexed by the way this woman is portrayed in the press. I wish it would end this obsession with her hair and her clothes and her nannies and her crowded diary and the size of her bump, and just let her get on with it. That said, I still think her sister has a point. Relations between ordinary men and women may have changed enormously over the past few decades, but - as we hear year after year in study after study - life on the other side of the glass ceiling has changed rather less. It is still a man's world up there. The wives of the rich, the powerful and the august do still get wheeled in and out like cakes.</p> <p>The fact that more and more of these cakes lead independent lives off-stage is neither here nor there. As wives, it is pretty much as it was for their mothers and their grandmothers. They are assets only if they look right, act right and decline to speak out of turn. And if they break the rules? Well, just imagine what people would have said if Cherie Booth had gone to that boring old ballet and yawned openly. If she had admitted to a journalist that she would have preferred to stay at home. People would have felt she was letting the side down, representing her country badly, \"not doing her job\". And of course they would be right, because it is a job. And an exhausting, exacting, time-consuming job it is, too.</p> <p>Sadly, people only ever seem to notice this when a cake's wheeled in that clearly isn't up to it. The saddest thing is that it's not just their husbands and their husbands' colleagues who judge them by this antiquated code. The way we talk about Cherie Booth is proof that we all do it.</p> <p>Her friends were right to point out that she should be given the dignity to make her own choices. She should not have to worry about what signals she is sending out to the nation every time she makes a decision about when to put what first. It is hard enough as it is.</p> <p>But if I were a trophy wife, Cherie Booth would have me worried. She makes it all look so easy. Wherever she goes as wife-of-Tony, she must make other husbands wonder why it is they have settled for women who don't have her accomplishments. Do some of them ask themselves if the time hasn't come for them to trade the old trophy in for a new model that is brainy and all the other things a good asset should be?</p> <p>It is impossible to know how people end up choosing their real mates, but I think I see a hint of a worrying shift in those interviews we've all been reading lately with the young internet millionaires. When asked about their ideal mates, many of these young men talk about looking for women who are beautiful and appreciative of their generous gifts, but not materialistic and very giving, willing to \"be there\" for them. Much, you might say, as their fathers might have done.</p> <p>But it is not enough. They also want to find someone who is (as one neonate millionaire put it) \"an independent woman with her own life. Someone with a demanding job of her own, who understands that work doesn't start at 9 and finish at 5\". Someone like Cherie, in other words.</p> <p>I suspect Cherie would be the first to want to tell this guy no wife should be held to such a punishing programme.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>A mayor for London</b> <p><b>The cynical hack says</b><br> Tony Blair's ill-fated commitment to devolving power in London is symbolic of the government's control freakery. The mayoral post lacks any real authority, yet the prime minister authorised a scandalously undemocratic fixing of the ballot to \"choose\" Frank Dobson as Labour's candidate. In one stroke of his fixer's pen, Mr Blair managed to alienate many in Labour's heartlands and elevated Ken Livingstone into a folk hero. Mr Livingstone is set to triumph in May and if he fails to transform the tube you can be sure he will let Londoners know that Mr Blair is to blame.</p> <p><b>The spin doctor says</b><br> Tony Blair's creation of a London mayor is part of a radical devolution programme which, in time, could lead to a series of city mayors across the English regions. It is a measure of the man that no other recent political leader would contemplate giving away his own power. The ballot which elected Mr Dobson was almost identical to the one which gave Mr Blair the leadership of the Labour party. That Ken Livingstone would not accept the result is testimony to his egotism and personal ambition.</p> <p><b>Verdict</b><br> The prime minister's ill-fated attempts to fix the outcome have only boosted Mr Livingstone's popularity and left Mr Blair to take the blame if the mayor is unable to alleviate London's transport and social problems. But voters in the rest of the country are so fed up about the national media's metropolitan obsession that they could not care less.</p> <p><b>Grammar schools</b></p> <p><b>The cynical hack says</b><br> David Blunkett's rash George Bush parody - \"read my lips - no more selection\" - could hardly be a clearer commitment to abolishing grammar schools, yet Tony Blair also promised that \"a Labour government will not close your grammar schools\". The government has been castigated by both the pro- and anti-selection sides for allowing parental votes on the subject to be \"rigged\", probably because it lacked the courage to make clear its convictions in the first place. <b>The spin doctor says</b><br> Labour's 1997 election manifesto pledged never to put dogma before children's education. The party promised that \"any changes in the admissions policies of grammar schools will be decided by local parents\". David Blunkett stood by this after parents voted against abolishing Ripon grammar school. \"We are against the 11-plus and we remain against it. But we aren't in favour of putting this issue over standards.\"</p> <p><b>Verdict</b><br> Selective schooling is an emotive subject and Labour rightly chose to \"let the people decide\". There are only 166 grammar schools in the country, and more important will be how Labour is judged to be meeting its much-vaunted priority of \"education, education, education\" and its commitment to improving standards and reducing class sizes. Those promises look much harder to keep.</p> <p><b>Abolishing jury trial for minor offences</b></p> <p><b>The cynical hack says</b><br> Before Labour came to power, Jack Straw attacked Tory plans to abolish a defendant's right to jury trial for a range of minor offences, such as theft, as \"shortsighted and wrong\".

      "bodyText": "A mayor for London The cynical hack says Tony Blair's ill-fated commitment to devolving power in London is symbolic of the government's control freakery. The mayoral post lacks any real authority, yet the prime minister authorised a scandalously undemocratic fixing of the ballot to \"choose\" Frank Dobson as Labour's candidate. In one stroke of his fixer's pen, Mr Blair managed to alienate many in Labour's heartlands and elevated Ken Livingstone into a folk hero. Mr Livingstone is set to triumph in May and if he fails to transform the tube you can be sure he will let Londoners know that Mr Blair is to blame. The spin doctor says Tony Blair's creation of a London mayor is part of a radical devolution programme which, in time, could lead to a series of city mayors across the English regions. It is a measure of the man that no other recent political leader would contemplate giving away his own power. The ballot which elected Mr Dobson was almost identical to the one which gave Mr Blair the leadership of the Labour party. That Ken Livingstone would not accept the result is testimony to his egotism and personal ambition. Verdict The prime minister's ill-fated attempts to fix the outcome have only boosted Mr Livingstone's popularity and left Mr Blair to take the blame if the mayor is unable to alleviate London's transport and social problems. But voters in the rest of the country are so fed up about the national media's metropolitan obsession that they could not care less. Grammar schools The cynical hack says David Blunkett's rash George Bush parody - \"read my lips - no more selection\" - could hardly be a clearer commitment to abolishing grammar schools, yet Tony Blair also promised that \"a Labour government will not close your grammar schools\". The government has been castigated by both the pro- and anti-selection sides for allowing parental votes on the subject to be \"rigged\", probably because it lacked the courage to make clear its convictions in the first place. The spin doctor says Labour's 1997 election manifesto pledged never to put dogma before children's education. The party promised that \"any changes in the admissions policies of grammar schools will be decided by local parents\". David Blunkett stood by this after parents voted against abolishing Ripon grammar school. \"We are against the 11-plus and we remain against it. But we aren't in favour of putting this issue over standards.\" Verdict Selective schooling is an emotive subject and Labour rightly chose to \"let the people decide\". There are only 166 grammar schools in the country, and more important will be how Labour is judged to be meeting its much-vaunted priority of \"education, education, education\" and its commitment to improving standards and reducing class sizes. Those promises look much harder to keep. Abolishing jury trial for minor offences The cynical hack says Before Labour came to power, Jack Straw attacked Tory plans to abolish a defendant's right to jury trial for a range of minor offences, such as theft, as \"shortsighted and wrong\". As home secretary he changed his mind. His bill was defeated by the Lords, but Mr Straw persisted in introducing another. His estimate of how much it will save has recently risen from an optimistic \u00a3105m to a fanciful \u00a3128m. Many lawyers, Labour peers and civil liberties groups argue that his decision will not save money and will create a two-tier system of justice which discriminates against the poor and ethnic minorities. The spin doctor says The present system is abused by criminal defendants who spin out their cases or choose an expensive jury trial because the chance of acquittal is much higher. All the fuss about Englishmen being denied the right to trial by their peers is nonsense, jury trial will remain for all serious cases. No high principle is at stake in the practical reform, it is more a minor matter of improving the administration of justice and saving more than \u00a3100m in the process. Verdict One of Labour's more minor misdemeanours, it seems to demonstrate a lack of consistency and an occasionally cavalier approach to justice. But as with devolution, vacillation over electoral reform and the release of General Augusto Pinochet, it is something to outrage the chattering classes at dinner, rather than swing voters at an election. Refusing to commit to the euro The cynical hack says Like redistributing wealth, the government knows the right thing to do and is nudging towards it, but despite a 171-seat parliamentary majority lacks the guts to embrace it. Three years of refusing to commit to the single currency has eroded support for the euro. Failing to join in the first phase has again left Britain on the sidelines in Europe, and means that a profitable convergence of its economy with euroland is even more unlikely. The spin doctor says The government has maintained an utterly consistent position: membership of the single currency \"must be determined by a hard-headed assessment of Britain's economic interests,\" as the 1997 manifesto stated. This remains its position. If suitable economic circumstances arise, the government will submit the decision to a referendum.

Tony and Cherie's baby The cynical hack says Alastair Campbell could not make it up. The spin doctor says It will be a joyous moment, showing Tony and Cherie to be at the heart of an ordinary, loving family. Both will prove what genuine, doting parents they are when May 24 dawns. However, the Blair family must be allowed their privacy. Verdict The Blairs should not milk good publicity from the birth and complain later of a lack of privacy, Tony and Cherie's place as a much-loved modern day monarchy is assured - for another term at least.

Credo che la Fiorentina abbia rinunciato fin dall'inizio all'idea di competere per lo scudetto, lasciando il campo a quelle grandi multinazionali del calcio che sono Juventus, Milan, Inter, Lazio e Roma. Nel nostro campionato siamo in una posizione abbastanza intermedia, ma \u00e8 una squadra con uno straordinario potenziale internazionale. </p> <p>Mi pare che l'ambizione di Trapattoni sia di portare la Fiorentina in alte posizioni nella Coppa dei Campioni: la vittoria sul Manchester United, e quella sul Valencia nel girone di andata sono molto promettenti. Due settimane fa ho visto proprio la partita con il Valencia, ma non mi \u00e8 tanto piaciuta, perch\u00e9 abbiamo strappato la vittoria con molta fatica. Batistuta sembrava l'ombra di se stesso. Per\u00f2 \u00e8 una squadra inaspettata, di puledri di razza, che se scatta, scatta.

Credo che la Fiorentina abbia rinunciato fin dall'inizio all'idea di competere per lo scudetto, lasciando il campo a quelle grandi multinazionali del calcio che sono Juventus, Milan, Inter, Lazio e Roma. Nel nostro campionato siamo in una posizione abbastanza intermedia, ma \u00e8 una squadra con uno straordinario potenziale internazionale. Mi pare che l'ambizione di Trapattoni sia di portare la Fiorentina in alte posizioni nella Coppa dei Campioni: la vittoria sul Manchester United, e quella sul Valencia nel girone di andata sono molto promettenti. Due settimane fa ho visto proprio la partita con il Valencia, ma non mi \u00e8 tanto piaciuta, perch\u00e9 abbiamo strappato la vittoria con molta fatica. Batistuta sembrava l'ombra di se stesso. Per\u00f2 \u00e8 una squadra inaspettata, di puledri di razza, che se scatta, scatta.

A book which gleefully reported such snippets as the line - said by a hack to the wives of Allan Lamb and Paul Downton - \"If you don't manage to score with the team there are always plenty of press men around for consolation prizes\", was bound to be a bestseller. And in the days when English cricket was almost up there with football in the national consciousness, it made Frances Edmonds more famous than her husband. </p> <p>But 14 years later, it hardly looks like a breakthrough work. The canon of female cricket writers can be counted on one hand: Margaret Hughes, Bridgette Lawrence, Michelle Savidge, Teresa McLean and Edmonds. So what? you might ask: cricket is, after all, a game still dominated by men.

      "bodyText": "When Another Bloody Tour by Frances Edmonds hit the bookshelves in 1986 it caused a sensation. Hailed \"cricket book of the year\" by the Evening Standard, it was an intelligent, wickedly funny report of England's disastrous 1985-86 tour of West Indies. A book which gleefully reported such snippets as the line - said by a hack to the wives of Allan Lamb and Paul Downton - \"If you don't manage to score with the team there are always plenty of press men around for consolation prizes\", was bound to be a bestseller. And in the days when English cricket was almost up there with football in the national consciousness, it made Frances Edmonds more famous than her husband. But 14 years later, it hardly looks like a breakthrough work. The canon of female cricket writers can be counted on one hand: Margaret Hughes, Bridgette Lawrence, Michelle Savidge, Teresa McLean and Edmonds. So what? you might ask: cricket is, after all, a game still dominated by men. But that misses the point, because although the market for cricket literature isn't that large, the number of cricket books that make it into print remains phenomenal. And, as Stephen Chalke, author of Runs in the Memory, reveals in April's WCM, self-published books can be a success. WCM receives plenty of potential manuscripts each year, (usually bound and stamped British Rights Reserved) and without exception they are from men.

The phenomenon behind So-Fa Not So Good (a light-hearted diary of a Surrey obsessive) was Caroline Kemp, a 30-year-old who owns a (soon to be sold) print and design business with her husband, Andy.

It was the first restitution in Britain of a painting looted by the Nazis to its rightful owners. The label now states that The Three Stages of Life, a grimly imposing 19th century German triptych by Count Leopold von Kalckreuth, is on loan from \"a private collection\", instead of the Neue Pinakothek in Munich, whose director had just handed over a formal document renouncing any German state claim to the picture. The \"private collection\" is Marietta Glanville, 70, and her brother Ernest, 75, who live 10 minutes apart in north London, and could hardly believe that their family's half-century hunt was over. They lodged a claim with the commission for looted art in Europe only a month before the academy exhibition opened in January. The commission's research director, Diane Michaels, attended a private view of the show, which reassembled famous and once famous pictures originally shown together in Paris in 1900. She was astounded to be confronted by the original of the painting about which she had a file of notes on her desk. After decades of the family being told by the German authorities that they had no case in law, because their claim was lodged too late, it took just 10 weeks to resolve the case. One of the few Glanville family treasures to survive the Nazi years was a black and white photograph of the picture hanging on their dining room wall in Vienna. It had been a wedding present from their grandparents to their mother. The picture profoundly affected Marietta, whose seat at the table was directly opposite the monumental figures portraying a woman's life from buxom girl to broken crone. \"It was an icon of our family,\" she said yesterday.

When the family discovered that it was in the stores of the Neue Pinakothek which was bombed and not rebuilt until the 1970s the claim was thrown out because too much time had passed. The restitution yesterday was agreed on moral, not legal grounds, but Reinhold Baum stark, director of the Bavarian state collection of paintings, who made the formal hand-over, said he personally believed all such pictures should be returned. Anne Webber, chairwoman of the commission on looted art, which is pursuing hundreds of similar claims, said it set an inescapable precedent for the British government, and the British national collections, which earlier this month published a list of 350 works of art with doubtful provenance in the war years.

      "trailText": "<p>Jean Baudrillard is a consummate self-inventor, radical thinker - and takes a fine photograph, too. He talks to  Steven Poole</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Jean Baudrillard's lecture in London last Friday did not take place. But don't be alarmed: the aim of thought, after all, is not truth or reality. Thinking is the art of making things disappear. Let's try, then, to make this impish, septuagenarian matre \u00e0 penser disappear too. </p> <p>Picture, if you will, Baudrillard in the chemistry lecture theatre of University College, London. Gazing down from a side wall is a vast chart of the periodic table, whose elements huddle together for comfort, anxious at the appearance in their midst of this unpredictable catalyst. Baudrillard looks wonderfully like a hyperreal cafe Frenchman: short, rotund, in a crumpled suit, with tufts of golden-grey hair poking out from his temples. But that appearance is a mask. </p> <p>To an audience of alternately amused and blankly bamboozled architecture students, Baudrillard delivers an hour of sizzlingly dense, rococo argumentation in his warm but near-impenetrable Gallic tones. He explains his love of taking photographs, and mercilessly dissects the poverty of modern art. He laments the loss of magic, the fact that in an age of technical explanation, the universe has now \"fallen\" into a banal reality. The universe is given to us ready-made, like Duchamp's urinal. And art has no answer to this; it can only rehearse the disaster. \"To turn an object into art,\" Baudrillard smiles, \"you just have to make it useless.\" But the idea of uselessness is itself useless. Today, we merely enjoy the idea of art, not art itself. </p> <p>Why? Baudrillard calls it \"image-feedback\". The image masks itself with an idea of itself. It constantly transforms itself into a message, and thus prevents us from seeing. Meaning, the omnipresent, choking smog of the post-industrial era gets in the way. This is true of all visual media. \"It is the TV that looks at us,\" he insists, \"from a blind spot, from nothing.\" Our gaze is turned back from this dead zone and blinds us. </p> <p>And yet there is hope. Perhaps a certain sort of image could \"break the screen\". And perhaps photography is the weapon for this violent liberation. Because photography, if it avoids being assimilated to a message, can be unintelligible: the opposite of thinking. The potential for \"something that is neither true nor real, but is beautiful\". That is Baudrillard's plea, his challenge. </p> <p>Across the road after the lecture we congregate in the bar, drinking beer while Baudrillard's own photos are projected in triptych on the walls. The images are inscrutable. An empty red armchair faces out at the viewer, enacting the disappearance of a human body, whose shape remains, in Baudrillard's own beautiful phrase, \"like a smile\". Close-ups of brick walls or alleys radiating in ecstasies of brown and blue; a lone bicycle gazing out over a golden river; a philosopher's still-life of book, pens, ashtray and coffee bowl; keys on a cafe table; splotches of red and black paint on a wall, almost humanoid. These stories of charged absence continue to glow on the walls as the bar empties and the chatter fades. </p> <p>The next morning I meet Baudrillard at his hotel in South Kensington. \"Oh, the grand homme himself!\" chirps the receptionist, after I repeat the magic code of his name. Downstairs in the bar, Baudrillard drinks black coffee and smokes a cigarette he has rolled in advance; he delivers a rolling monologue in an English-French hybrid. It's early, but the twinkle in his eyes bespeaks pure joy in thought. \"Ouf, it's a game!\" he says, as if astonished that anyone could think otherwise of thinking. </p> <p>But sometimes even champions need a break. That's why Baudrillard took up photography, as a way of escaping writing and thinking. \"I began to photograph without any ambitions,\" he says, \"not to be exhibited. It was just surprise encounters with objects, with situations, with lights.\" He had tried to take portraits of people, but \"it's a disease of mine before human beings,\" he confesses. \"I cannot take them as subjects. With objects it's an elective affinity, as far as they are traces of the living human world.\" </p> <p>His photographs, he hopes, are without \"meaning\". For Baudrillard adores unintelligibility. There is not enough of it around. \"Gone is the innocence of nonsense,\" he said wistfully in his lecture. But he tries his best: \"It is the task of radical thought, since the world is given to us in unintelligibility, to make it more unintelligible, more enigmatic, more fabulous.\" </p> <p>That is why we love Baudrillard: because he can do this. But that is not to say he is a mere conjurer of nonsense. Baudrillard foresaw the allure of virtual reality long before William Gibson; he was in the vanguard of Marxian critiques of modern consumerism; before it became fashionable, he wrote a scintillating analysis of man's sentimental exploitation of animals. Baudrillard got there first, many times. And now his self-imposed task is \"this art of taking reality as fiction, taking fiction as a hyperreality\". To shock us into realising that thought and the world need not be as they are. </p> <p>That is why we love him; it is also why he enrages a certain stodgy, anti-imaginative Anglo-American sensibility. Baudrillard is most infamous in non-philosophical circles for having said that the Gulf war did not take place. The theory is that these days, the \"model\" precedes the event and exhausts it totally in advance. The Gulf war was played out as simulation before any tanks began rolling, and then it was played out again as simulation through videogame-style missile-runs on TV. Behind this orgiastic virtuality, the \"real\" event was nowhere to be seen. </p> <p>Baudrillard's pioneering analysis is now common - so thoroughly domesticated as to figure in such books as Michael Ignatieff's recent Virtual War. A few years ago, Baudrillard also claimed that the year 2000 would not happen. So? Did it? \"No,\" Baudrillard insists gleefully. \"Because we were already in the 21st century long before we came to this dead point. We abused the scenario of the millennium long before it happened. Now, we stay in the 20th century. We have not really passed over. We don't live in a rational time...\" </p> <p> But what, pray, is a \"rational time\"? The most high-profile charge levelled against Baudrillard's game of thinking came a few years ago from Alan Sokal's and Jean Bricmont's book, Intellectual Impostures, which named Baudrillard among a phalanx of French \"postmodernist\" thinkers who regularly abuse scientific concepts. It caused a huge storm in France, and an ejaculation of happy sneering over here, fortifying the complacent impression of those who had never bothered to read any French philosophy that it was all a load of rubbish. </p> <p>Up until now, Baudrillard has not dignified the attack with a public reply. I ask him about it, and he sighs simply: \"It's a misunderstanding of metaphor.\" It is further, in his view, based on an outmoded idea of the scientific process. Nowadays, Baudrillard argues, we know that hypotheses are never verified - \"they give way to other hypotheses. And thought has always been like that...

      "bodyText": "Jean Baudrillard's lecture in London last Friday did not take place. But don't be alarmed: the aim of thought, after all, is not truth or reality. Thinking is the art of making things disappear. Let's try, then, to make this impish, septuagenarian matre \u00e0 penser disappear too. Picture, if you will, Baudrillard in the chemistry lecture theatre of University College, London. Gazing down from a side wall is a vast chart of the periodic table, whose elements huddle together for comfort, anxious at the appearance in their midst of this unpredictable catalyst. Baudrillard looks wonderfully like a hyperreal cafe Frenchman: short, rotund, in a crumpled suit, with tufts of golden-grey hair poking out from his temples. But that appearance is a mask. To an audience of alternately amused and blankly bamboozled architecture students, Baudrillard delivers an hour of sizzlingly dense, rococo argumentation in his warm but near-impenetrable Gallic tones. He explains his love of taking photographs, and mercilessly dissects the poverty of modern art. He laments the loss of magic, the fact that in an age of technical explanation, the universe has now \"fallen\" into a banal reality. The universe is given to us ready-made, like Duchamp's urinal. And art has no answer to this; it can only rehearse the disaster. \"To turn an object into art,\" Baudrillard smiles, \"you just have to make it useless.\" But the idea of uselessness is itself useless. Today, we merely enjoy the idea of art, not art itself. Why? Baudrillard calls it \"image-feedback\". The image masks itself with an idea of itself. It constantly transforms itself into a message, and thus prevents us from seeing. Meaning, the omnipresent, choking smog of the post-industrial era gets in the way. This is true of all visual media. \"It is the TV that looks at us,\" he insists, \"from a blind spot, from nothing.\" Our gaze is turned back from this dead zone and blinds us. And yet there is hope. Perhaps a certain sort of image could \"break the screen\". And perhaps photography is the weapon for this violent liberation. Because photography, if it avoids being assimilated to a message, can be unintelligible: the opposite of thinking. The potential for \"something that is neither true nor real, but is beautiful\". That is Baudrillard's plea, his challenge. Across the road after the lecture we congregate in the bar, drinking beer while Baudrillard's own photos are projected in triptych on the walls. The images are inscrutable. An empty red armchair faces out at the viewer, enacting the disappearance of a human body, whose shape remains, in Baudrillard's own beautiful phrase, \"like a smile\". Close-ups of brick walls or alleys radiating in ecstasies of brown and blue; a lone bicycle gazing out over a golden river; a philosopher's still-life of book, pens, ashtray and coffee bowl; keys on a cafe table; splotches of red and black paint on a wall, almost humanoid. These stories of charged absence continue to glow on the walls as the bar empties and the chatter fades. The next morning I meet Baudrillard at his hotel in South Kensington. \"Oh, the grand homme himself!\" chirps the receptionist, after I repeat the magic code of his name. Downstairs in the bar, Baudrillard drinks black coffee and smokes a cigarette he has rolled in advance; he delivers a rolling monologue in an English-French hybrid. It's early, but the twinkle in his eyes bespeaks pure joy in thought. \"Ouf, it's a game!\" he says, as if astonished that anyone could think otherwise of thinking. But sometimes even champions need a break. That's why Baudrillard took up photography, as a way of escaping writing and thinking. \"I began to photograph without any ambitions,\" he says, \"not to be exhibited. It was just surprise encounters with objects, with situations, with lights.\" He had tried to take portraits of people, but \"it's a disease of mine before human beings,\" he confesses. \"I cannot take them as subjects. With objects it's an elective affinity, as far as they are traces of the living human world.\" His photographs, he hopes, are without \"meaning\". For Baudrillard adores unintelligibility. There is not enough of it around. \"Gone is the innocence of nonsense,\" he said wistfully in his lecture. But he tries his best: \"It is the task of radical thought, since the world is given to us in unintelligibility, to make it more unintelligible, more enigmatic, more fabulous.\" That is why we love Baudrillard: because he can do this. But that is not to say he is a mere conjurer of nonsense. Baudrillard foresaw the allure of virtual reality long before William Gibson; he was in the vanguard of Marxian critiques of modern consumerism; before it became fashionable, he wrote a scintillating analysis of man's sentimental exploitation of animals. Baudrillard got there first, many times. And now his self-imposed task is \"this art of taking reality as fiction, taking fiction as a hyperreality\". To shock us into realising that thought and the world need not be as they are. That is why we love him; it is also why he enrages a certain stodgy, anti-imaginative Anglo-American sensibility. Baudrillard is most infamous in non-philosophical circles for having said that the Gulf war did not take place. The theory is that these days, the \"model\" precedes the event and exhausts it totally in advance. The Gulf war was played out as simulation before any tanks began rolling, and then it was played out again as simulation through videogame-style missile-runs on TV. Behind this orgiastic virtuality, the \"real\" event was nowhere to be seen. Baudrillard's pioneering analysis is now common - so thoroughly domesticated as to figure in such books as Michael Ignatieff's recent Virtual War. A few years ago, Baudrillard also claimed that the year 2000 would not happen. So? Did it? \"No,\" Baudrillard insists gleefully. \"Because we were already in the 21st century long before we came to this dead point. We abused the scenario of the millennium long before it happened. Now, we stay in the 20th century. We have not really passed over. We don't live in a rational time...\" But what, pray, is a \"rational time\"? The most high-profile charge levelled against Baudrillard's game of thinking came a few years ago from Alan Sokal's and Jean Bricmont's book, Intellectual Impostures, which named Baudrillard among a phalanx of French \"postmodernist\" thinkers who regularly abuse scientific concepts. It caused a huge storm in France, and an ejaculation of happy sneering over here, fortifying the complacent impression of those who had never bothered to read any French philosophy that it was all a load of rubbish. Up until now, Baudrillard has not dignified the attack with a public reply. I ask him about it, and he sighs simply: \"It's a misunderstanding of metaphor.\" It is further, in his view, based on an outmoded idea of the scientific process. Nowadays, Baudrillard argues, we know that hypotheses are never verified - \"they give way to other hypotheses. And thought has always been like that... I was surprised that no scientist ever answered to Sokal himself as a scientist.\" And then he adds, with a devious grin: \"In a way it was a compliment.\" To be accused of imposture, after all, is not necessarily a bad thing. \"There is a good use of imposture,\" he points out slyly. \"It is the art never to take a definite posture.

To be even grudgingly approved by one side means being damned by the other.</p> <p>So it must be quite a relief when discussion turns to Michael Fabricant's mother. I have not had the pleasure of meeting Mrs Helena Fabricant, but it does not sound as if she is hard-wired into Mr Blair's e-Britain.</p> <p>At home office questions, Jack Straw had been asked about the possibility of electronic voting, of which he is broadly in favour. Mickey sprang to his feet. \"People like my mother, who lives in Lichfield,\" he said, \"are quite nervous about using ATM cards. She likes writing out cheques. And when she votes, she likes to make a cross, the old-fashioned way.\"</p> <p>Mrs F's unease with modern technology may account for a lot. I suspect that when she was carrying young Mickey, she may have been frightened by a Morris Oxford.</p> <p>Then there was the matter of the new name for the probation service. Very unwillingly, Paul Boateng, the vengeance minister (not his real title), has agreed that this should now be called the national probation service.</p> <p>\"My joy at that announcement is literally boundless,\" cried John Bercow. \"You will earn a shower of plaudits.\"</p> <p>This seems a little over the top, even for Mr Bercow, until you realise that up to yesterday the government was clinging to its earlier decision to call this body the Community Rehabilitation And Probation service. Clearly no one had bothered to read the acronym.</p> <p>Still, it cannot have caused Mr Straw to lie awake during the long dark nights of the soul. Nor would he have been troubled by Ann Widdecombe's assault over police numbers, one of those rows in which each side hurls carefully selected meaningless statistics, all yanked out of context.</p> <p>Miss Widdecombe was wearing a garment new to me, a loose black jacket covered in what appeared to be green bamboo shoots, so that she looked like a giant panda that had been rolling round in its lunch.</p> <p>Then suddenly we were on to the James Bulger murder, and the European court of human rights' decision over the murderers, Thompson and Venables. (I have said that I feel as sorry for their parents as for the Bulgers, for they too have lost their sons, and also have a burden of guilt, shame and public odium that few of us could live with. But MPs are not allowed to think like this.)</p> <p>I myself was slightly perturbed by Mr Straw saying that, when it came to sentencing, he plans to \"ensure that the views of the victims and their relatives are taken into account\".</p> <p>Memo to villains: you might get off lighter if you mug Quakers, Hampstead liberals, and Guardian read ers rather than Essex blokes with earrings and big dogs.</p> <p>Miss Widdecombe said that the court ruling would cause \"great disappointment and offence\". Mr Straw can't talk like that. But asked by Michael Howard to say why politicians should be allowed to set sentences for adult killers but not children, he waved a contemptuous hand at the court's thick ruling.</p> <p>\"Bound in the dense text of this judgment, there may be some elucidation. But not, perhaps, illumination.\"</p> <p>The home secretary came no nearer to telling the Strasbourg lawyers to get knotted. But it must have been a pleasant short relief before he returns again to the endless moral agonising his job entails.</p>",

To be even grudgingly approved by one side means being damned by the other. So it must be quite a relief when discussion turns to Michael Fabricant's mother. I have not had the pleasure of meeting Mrs Helena Fabricant, but it does not sound as if she is hard-wired into Mr Blair's e-Britain. At home office questions, Jack Straw had been asked about the possibility of electronic voting, of which he is broadly in favour. Mickey sprang to his feet. \"People like my mother, who lives in Lichfield,\" he said, \"are quite nervous about using ATM cards. She likes writing out cheques. And when she votes, she likes to make a cross, the old-fashioned way.\" Mrs F's unease with modern technology may account for a lot. I suspect that when she was carrying young Mickey, she may have been frightened by a Morris Oxford. Then there was the matter of the new name for the probation service. Very unwillingly, Paul Boateng, the vengeance minister (not his real title), has agreed that this should now be called the national probation service. \"My joy at that announcement is literally boundless,\" cried John Bercow. \"You will earn a shower of plaudits.\" This seems a little over the top, even for Mr Bercow, until you realise that up to yesterday the government was clinging to its earlier decision to call this body the Community Rehabilitation And Probation service. Clearly no one had bothered to read the acronym. Still, it cannot have caused Mr Straw to lie awake during the long dark nights of the soul. Nor would he have been troubled by Ann Widdecombe's assault over police numbers, one of those rows in which each side hurls carefully selected meaningless statistics, all yanked out of context. Miss Widdecombe was wearing a garment new to me, a loose black jacket covered in what appeared to be green bamboo shoots, so that she looked like a giant panda that had been rolling round in its lunch. Then suddenly we were on to the James Bulger murder, and the European court of human rights' decision over the murderers, Thompson and Venables. (I have said that I feel as sorry for their parents as for the Bulgers, for they too have lost their sons, and also have a burden of guilt, shame and public odium that few of us could live with. But MPs are not allowed to think like this.) I myself was slightly perturbed by Mr Straw saying that, when it came to sentencing, he plans to \"ensure that the views of the victims and their relatives are taken into account\". Memo to villains: you might get off lighter if you mug Quakers, Hampstead liberals, and Guardian read ers rather than Essex blokes with earrings and big dogs. Miss Widdecombe said that the court ruling would cause \"great disappointment and offence\". Mr Straw can't talk like that. But asked by Michael Howard to say why politicians should be allowed to set sentences for adult killers but not children, he waved a contemptuous hand at the court's thick ruling. \"Bound in the dense text of this judgment, there may be some elucidation. But not, perhaps, illumination.\" The home secretary came no nearer to telling the Strasbourg lawyers to get knotted. But it must have been a pleasant short relief before he returns again to the endless moral agonising his job entails.",

They will also have a critical role, he says, in deciding precisely what kind of education and training the remaining 85% of the money is spent on locally. \"If you are a business person or an employer, consider putting yourself forward to be on one of these councils, because they really will make a difference. They are our opportunity to ensure we get the highly skilled, trained and motivated 21st-century workforce that we will need to compete. \"These are not talking shops. These are important groups with decision-making powers.\" To colleges fearful of losing their autonomy, he emphasised that the councils are designed to balance the needs of the various interested parties - students, colleges, other providers and employers. One of his company's fundamental beliefs, he said, is that its employees should be active model citizens and welcome partners in their local communities. His underlying message seems to be that those in the wider business community could do worse than follow Coke's example and step forward to serve when the call comes.",

Everything stopped at it.\" </p> <p>Northern Ireland's 17 further education colleges were working within a very small geographic and population area, dominated by the violence. Since 1972, decisions had been made by Westminster direct rule ministers, whose interests were primarily English. There were no links with colleges in Ireland, no sharing of expertise and no access to the much more vibrant Irish economy. Protestants hesitated to seek contacts. </p> <p>\"Change now is down to agencies like ourselves,\" Hunter says. </p> <p>Sadly the politicians in London and Belfast seem determined to block that revolution. The reimposition in February of direct rule from Westminster after the Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, threatened to resign as First Minister, was, Dr Hunter believes, little short of tragic. </p> <p>When devolution came last November the education departments were reorganised, giving responsibility for training, further education and higher education to one minister and all pre-16 education to another. Dr Sean Farren, the Social Democratic and Labour Party member to whom the higher and further portfolio fell, lectured for 25 years at the University of Ulster in Coleraine. Many decisions had been put on hold during the talks which took place between the Good Friday agreement and devolution, and were now hurried through. </p> <p>Dr Farren spent his first fortnight as a minister doing the rounds of further education and training personnel, admitting his lack of knowledge. </p> <p>\"I recognise that people will assume that my real interest is higher education,\" he said, \"but I recognise that further education has been the Cinderella and I want to see equality in provision and in funding.\" </p> <p>He instituted an immediate enquiry into student funding, including fees, looking at Scottish developments and was considering giving further education students parity with higher education. That enquiry is continuing, but with no local minister to report to. He promised to encourage links between further education colleges and the Northern Ireland universities, and to promote franchising of degrees. Almost his last decision was to approve a new university campus with further education links at Springvale on the peaceline in Belfast. </p> <p>The imposition of fees by the British government has raised a barrier in Ireland that Dr Hunter believes is culturally damaging. A social scientist, he taught at the Belfast Institute until he became the Association's second director a year ago. </p> <p>\"We taught an HND Social Care course. It was useful having people in the class who came from the other jurisdiction. It is useful to see that there is another point of view if you teach community relations. A lot of people ignore the differences, but you don't solve anything that way.\" Now far fewer southerners can afford to come north. </p> <p>David Hunter was impressed by devolution. \"I think we had a minister who wasn't from England, who had a real interest. We were seeing a greater focus. We were trying to solve our own problems. It became our responsibility not the responsibility of somebody who did not have to report back to a democratic body in Northern Ireland. What we appreciated was that he had a real commitment to social inclusion.\" </p> <p>Dr Hunter is an adult learner himself, having worked in England, then returned to college to take A levels. His first job back in Northern Ireland was with the Shankill Initiative, a development programme to regenerate a poverty-stricken and fiercely loyalist area of Belfast. His wife, a nurse, is finishing an Open University degree. His ambition is a secure future in Northern Ireland for his children. </p> <p>His son has just passed his 11-plus and his daughter is 17 and considering university. </p> <p>Like so many other parents, particularly Protestants - who are witnessing a disproportionate brain drain of student children because they fear unionism has no future - he hates the thought of them going to Britain to study and never returning. The arrival of devolved government meant, he had hoped, \"that my children could have normal lives here.\" </p> <p> The further education revolution was encouraged by the IRA ceasefires, and given momentum by the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. Two years ago Northern Ireland's further education colleges were removed from the control of the Education and Libraries Board and followed the English colleges into incorporation. They combined to form the Association and instituted cross border partnerships to pool knowledge. Colleges north and south were asked to consider shared teaching and moderation and swapping of expertise in specialist areas. </p> <p>Last October the Association took 150 people involved in further education to Innis, County Clare, Ireland's e-town. </p> <p>\"What we saw there was the town of the future. Schools, colleges and businesses were all linked through the internet.\" </p> <p>A meeting in Athlone of principals from north and south followed, and partnerships have been made with employers and local authorities. The Association began nurturing initiatives in eight curriculum areas, designed to increase technical skills within Northern Ireland and to give people wanting leisure learning access to everything from Tiffaney glass to computing. </p> <p>Northern Ireland retains the 11-plus and has an education system that, at its best, produces much higher results than Britain, but, at its worst, nurtures significantly higher levels of adult illiteracy. A recent report by a team from Queen's and the University of Ulster shows the 11-plus has increased social and academic disadvantage. </p> <p>There is also a skills shortage in vital modern technical and information technology areas, where the north lags behind the south. Information technology and call centres are gold mines for remote areas. </p> <p>The skill gaps - together with currency disparities because Britain is outside the European currency union - make it more difficult for the north to attract IT industries. North-south disparities mean skilled workers head south, where the economy is booming. </p> <p>\"It is impossible to get a plumber or an electrician in the north,\" Dr Hunter said. \"There is a major skills drain.

It has turned one of the wildest of the bandit-country safe havens for terrorists into a boom town. </p> <p>Direct rule threatens progress, Dr Hunter said. \"The difference with devolution is the ability of our ministers to get involved and understand detail.

      "body": "<p>As fighting in the remote republic of Chechnya enters its seventh month, forces in Chechnya are being accused of war crimes, including the murder, rape and torture of civilians. Countries such as Britain are demanding that these stories are investigated, but in Russia the brutal campaign against Chechen forces has increased the popularity of acting president Vladimir Putin. </p> <p> <strong> Where is Chechnya?</strong> </p> <p>Find the Black Sea on a map of Russia and go east until you spot Grozny. This is the Chechen capital - now in ruins. Chechnya is a bit smaller than Wales. It is a land of grassy hills and in the south the foothills and high peaks of the Caucasus Mountains provide the remaining Chechen forces with cover for ambushes. The fertile middle of the country is dotted with villages. Here ordinary people have been in the firing line. </p> <p> <strong> What caused this conflict?</strong> </p> <p> In 1991, Chechen leaders declared that Chechnya was an independent state. Russia never accepted this. It blamed the Chechens for numerous acts of banditry against railways, buses and oil pipelines and decided to invade in December 1994. The result was a total defeat for the Russian army. Over 5,000 Russian troops may have died. Russia's desire to get even for this is a factor behind today's fighting. It also explains why the Russians have bombed Grozny and other settlements to smithereens rather than send in troops: the Chechens are expert street fighters. </p> <p> <strong> Why did the end of the war not bring peace?</strong> </p> <p>Since 1996, Chechnya's leaders have found it impossible to keep control. The raiding has continued and a campaign of kidnapping began. Among the victims were border guards, foreign visitors, Russian officials and businessmen. Many were killed - often by beheading. In August 1999, a strong force under the leadership of the popular Chechen commander Shamil Basayev and a Saudi Arabian called Habib Khattab attacked the neighbouring republic of Daghestan, hoping to unite it to Chechnya and create a single Islamic state. The Russian army was called to defend Daghestan and then moved into Chechnya to crush the \"rebels\". </p> <p> <strong> So why should anyone care about what happens in Chechnya?</strong> </p> <p> Any conflict that results in terrible slaughter should worry us. The citizens of Grozny and nearby villages have been the victims of the Russian bombardment and have been used as cover by Chechen fighters. Multiple rocket launchers and vacuum bombs, which create a fire storm and cause terrible blast injuries, have been used. </p> <p> <strong> Are there rules controlling such conflicts?</strong> </p> <p> There are international laws that are meant to regulate wars and conflicts. The 1949 Geneva Conventions cover the treatment of prisoners and civilians and, if they are broken, those responsible are guilty of war crimes. Unfortunately, the conventions are designed for fighting between countries. Internal wars are covered by a separate but weaker international agreement (Protocol II). The Russians are not even accepting that this is an \"internal conflict\" as defined by the Protocol. They call Chechen fighters terrorists and the fighting a \"police action\". Many Russians agree. </p> <p> <strong> But what about the killing of civilians?</strong> </p> <p> Human Rights Watch say Russian troops have been responsible for a series of massacres of ordinary people. The guards running special Russian \"filtration camps\" have been accused of torturing and raping Chechens. These human rights abuses are punishable, but Russia will have to cooperate. </p> <p> <strong> What else can be done?</strong> </p> <p> Western countries could try to reduce aid to Russia, but as much of this is helping to pay for Russian nuclear disarmament, no one wants to do that. </p> <p> <strong> Who benefits from this war?</strong> </p> <p> Vladimir Putin. He is likely to win the coming presidential election because of his strong stand. The Russian army has won pride after the 1996 disaster. The republics bordering Chechnya may be relieved there will be no Chechen invasion. </p> <p> <strong> Will the killing stop?</strong> </p> <p> It is likely to carry on, with Chechens ambushing Russian troops and Russian forces raiding. The republics bordering Chechnya are probably relieved there is no risk of a Chechen invasion. </p> <p><strong> Further information</strong></p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/chechnya\">Special report</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.hrw.org\">Human Rights Watch</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.iwpr.net\">Institute for War and Peace Reporting</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.crimesofwar.org\">www.crimesofwar.org</a></p>",

Countries such as Britain are demanding that these stories are investigated, but in Russia the brutal campaign against Chechen forces has increased the popularity of acting president Vladimir Putin. Where is Chechnya? Find the Black Sea on a map of Russia and go east until you spot Grozny. This is the Chechen capital - now in ruins. Chechnya is a bit smaller than Wales. It is a land of grassy hills and in the south the foothills and high peaks of the Caucasus Mountains provide the remaining Chechen forces with cover for ambushes. The fertile middle of the country is dotted with villages. Here ordinary people have been in the firing line. What caused this conflict? In 1991, Chechen leaders declared that Chechnya was an independent state. Russia never accepted this. It blamed the Chechens for numerous acts of banditry against railways, buses and oil pipelines and decided to invade in December 1994. The result was a total defeat for the Russian army. Over 5,000 Russian troops may have died. Russia's desire to get even for this is a factor behind today's fighting. It also explains why the Russians have bombed Grozny and other settlements to smithereens rather than send in troops: the Chechens are expert street fighters. Why did the end of the war not bring peace? Since 1996, Chechnya's leaders have found it impossible to keep control. The raiding has continued and a campaign of kidnapping began. Among the victims were border guards, foreign visitors, Russian officials and businessmen. Many were killed - often by beheading. In August 1999, a strong force under the leadership of the popular Chechen commander Shamil Basayev and a Saudi Arabian called Habib Khattab attacked the neighbouring republic of Daghestan, hoping to unite it to Chechnya and create a single Islamic state. The Russian army was called to defend Daghestan and then moved into Chechnya to crush the \"rebels\". So why should anyone care about what happens in Chechnya? Any conflict that results in terrible slaughter should worry us. The citizens of Grozny and nearby villages have been the victims of the Russian bombardment and have been used as cover by Chechen fighters. Multiple rocket launchers and vacuum bombs, which create a fire storm and cause terrible blast injuries, have been used. Are there rules controlling such conflicts? There are international laws that are meant to regulate wars and conflicts. The 1949 Geneva Conventions cover the treatment of prisoners and civilians and, if they are broken, those responsible are guilty of war crimes. Unfortunately, the conventions are designed for fighting between countries. Internal wars are covered by a separate but weaker international agreement (Protocol II). The Russians are not even accepting that this is an \"internal conflict\" as defined by the Protocol. They call Chechen fighters terrorists and the fighting a \"police action\". Many Russians agree. But what about the killing of civilians? Human Rights Watch say Russian troops have been responsible for a series of massacres of ordinary people. The guards running special Russian \"filtration camps\" have been accused of torturing and raping Chechens. These human rights abuses are punishable, but Russia will have to cooperate. What else can be done? Western countries could try to reduce aid to Russia, but as much of this is helping to pay for Russian nuclear disarmament, no one wants to do that. Who benefits from this war? Vladimir Putin. He is likely to win the coming presidential election because of his strong stand. The Russian army has won pride after the 1996 disaster. The republics bordering Chechnya may be relieved there will be no Chechen invasion. Will the killing stop? It is likely to carry on, with Chechens ambushing Russian troops and Russian forces raiding. The republics bordering Chechnya are probably relieved there is no risk of a Chechen invasion.

      "body": "<p>Coming some way behind the camel corps and the elephants, the float honouring education in India's constitution day parade in Delhi the other week represented, as so often in the subcontinent, a triumph of hope over experience. </p> <p>The eager pupils on the float tapped away industriously at their mock computer terminals, illuminated by the ubiquitous Microsoft logo, shining symbols of the country's aspirations. But unfortunately, by the time they floated past the crowds along the Rajpath, governmental Delhi's imperial highway, the attention of the spectators was already wandering, dazzled as they were by the much lengthier, earlier display of India's military might, its MiG fighters, tanks and weapons systems to counter the threat from Pakistan. </p> <p>There was little question as to which elements of the parade had received most care and resources from India's politicians. Although successive governments have launched initiatives and paid lip service to the importance of education, spending remains woefully low and the degree of the authorities' real commitment is questioned. </p> <p>India spends 3.9% of its GDP on education - that includes private sources as well as public - compared with 4.7% in Britain. Kailash Satyarthi, whose charity rescuing children from bonded labour in factories does not endear him to the authorities, said: \"There is a kind of hidden conspiracy. Everything is reserved into the hands of the high-class elite of society. If you opened everything up through education, their position would be threatened.\" </p> <p>Surveys even among the poorest rural labourers show parents increasingly keen for their children to be educated. And unlike 20 years ago, that includes girls. In Keonjhan, Orissa province, they have a saying: \"The educated have four eyes, whereas the uneducated are blind.\" Parents there told researchers that education was useful to avoid being cheated or to help set up a business. \"Men view education as a means of income generation, whereas women see it as an opportunity for enlightenment, earning respect and... improving marriage prospects.\" </p> <p> In Delhi you don't have to wander far to watch troops of children in immaculate school uniforms, their white shirts gleaming, picking their way home across the piles of rubbish that line the city's streets. On your flight back home to the west, you are quite likely to be seated next to an earnest young Indian student jetting off to Minnesota or Memphis to pursue his studies in microbiology or business. </p> <p>India is justly proud of such high achievers. Sadly, they remain the exception rather than the rule. In a country of 577,000 primary schools, where education in the local language was supposed to be guaranteed to every child as a right 30 years ago, insuperable problems remain and they may be getting worse. </p> <p>Against the goal set in the constitution 50 years ago, that every child should have access to free state education (a target which should have been reached by 1960), the Indian government can claim that 95% of the country's children now live within 1km of a school. Unfortunately, only two-thirds of six- to 10-year-olds manage to make it that far. Researchers note a series of reasons why some children do not get to school regularly even when their parents wish to send them: from floods washing away paths to tigers and cobras lurking in the verges. </p> <p>A recent report illustrates the problem: \"In Doodapura, Rajasthan, the school is located on a separate hill. Small children find it difficult to get there. During the monsoon, the path is under water and the school remains closed for weeks or even months at a time. There is no school in Chaktodar, Uttar Pradesh. The governing school in the neighbouring village of Gyanpur has to be approached through the bazaar. This makes it unsafe for children and compounds the distance problem,\" inspectors noted. </p> <p>Of those who do get to school, up to 80% of those in rural areas don't finish the course, leaving at least 33m children without any education at all. Only just over 52% of men and 39% of women across the country as a whole are literate. </p> <p>Even for those who get to school, the experience is often unrewarding. Although the school is usually the largest and best equipped building in the village, that is not always saying much. As recent researchers for a Probe (public report on basic education) survey remarked: \"Of the schools, 30% were used for non-teaching purposes. At least five were used by the teachers for residential purposes (spanking new schools built with World Bank aid seem to be one of their favourite dwellings). </p> <p>\"Other cases of gross misutilisation included their prolonged use as a storage space, a police camp, a place to dry cow dung cakes, a cattle shed and even a community latrine... Most school premises range from mildly unattractive to frankly repulsive. </p> <p>\"Rajkiya Draupadi Kanya Prathmik Vidhyalaya in Vangaon (north Bihar) is one of the few schools that boasts as many as four classrooms. However, these are close to disintegration. Six children were injured in three separate incidents when parts of the building fell down and even now there is an acute danger of terminal collapse. The children huddle in two rooms on sacking brought from home. There is no teaching equipment; blackboards are broken and there is no chalk. </p> <p>\"The playground is full of muck and slime. The overflowing drains could easily drown a small child. Mosquitoes are swarming. There is no toilet... teachers complain of neighbours using the playground as a toilet in the morning.\" </p> <p>The most ubiquitous teaching aid is the stick. Three quarters of schools now have blackboards, but only 23% have what could be called a library and 33% have what counts as equipment - sometimes even this is locked away by teachers who fear they may be charged if it is damaged. </p> <p>Tarun Sarwal, Oxfam's deputy director in India, says: \"There has been a huge increase in the media available. Most villages now have access to national television. They now have role models in their lives. Unfortunately, I have yet to see a rural school with a working computer. Most do not even have electricity.\" </p> <p>The Probe reporters found schools where teachers did not turn up, or arrived late or drunk. Fewer than 60% had had even a week's training. Only one in five were female - it is a difficult profession for a woman in a society where girls are expected to live at home until their marriage and there are likely to be suspicions if they are sent by the authorities to schools miles away across the state. </p> <p>Much teaching is done by rote, to centrally laid-down criteria, established by non-teachers, often taking little account of pupils' needs or aptitudes. Researchers found eight-year-olds being taught regulations for drivers under the highway code. Little wonder that attainment tests have to be adjusted downwards to ensure that at least some children pass. </p> <p>Snehlata Gupta, a Delhi teacher, says: \"The curriculum is drastically at variance with the life these children lead... They are simply unable to relate to the finer subtleties of birthday parties, balanced diets, family holidays or multi-storey homes... Much teaching is conducted in an abusive and callous manner. For these children, school does not open up a new world of learning and knowledge.\"</p> <p>A series of initiatives - Operation Blackboard, to establish minimum criteria for primary schools, Lok Jumbish, an attempt to involve local people more in the running of schools, which is supported by Britain's Department for International Development, the National Literacy Mission - have all had some effect. Regions such as Kerala, in the far south of the country, have achieved success by devoting higher priority to education than the more caste-bound states of the north. </p> <p>The smart money is on India to become one of the tiger economies of the 21st century. But if it is to do so, one of the world's great civilisations will have to do more for all its children. </p> <p><strong>Global Week of Action</strong></p> <p>Ten years ago, the world's governments promised \"education for all\" by 2000. Their priorities were to give all children a primary education and reduce adult illiteracy, especially among women. But these promises were not kept. At a world summit in 1995, they re-wrote the targets. This time they set the deadline for 2015. But who's to say they won't break their promises again? From April 3-10 there will be a Global Week of Action when the world's governments will meet.

To this end, the Synergy website was launched in 1999. It encourages schools to work together on research and to communicate via the internet. Pupils at Aylesbury Grammar helped to design the site. For further information about the Pupil Research Initiatives, call Dr Tony Sherborne on 0117-928 8718",

      "body": "<p>The little one that rolls up into a perfect ball is Armadillidum vulgare, the common pill woodlouse. Porcellio scaber is the common rough woodlouse and the common shiny one is called Oniscus asellus. British schoolchildren are about to get to know them in fine detail, along with most of the 35 other common species of British terrestrial Isopoda, or woodlice. </p> <p>The schoolchildren will be taking part in a nationwide, six month-long internet-based experiment in biodiversity, taxonomy, systematics and field zoology and they will be doing it under rotting logs, in the rockery, and behind the compost heap. </p> <p>Next week is national science week, the 7,500-event jamboree of technology, engineering and boffinpower across the nation launched on Friday (March 17). In the middle of the week, a tiny group of isopod-addicts will hatch a mass-observation experiment that could, if necessary, absorb data from every schoolchild in the country. </p> <p>Walking With Woodlice is about to be outlined as a serious proposal for 22,000 science and nature teachers. It is designed to fit in with stages two and three of the national curriculum, so biologists from seven to 13 will have a stake in it. Its climax - roughly at the end of the woodlouse hunting season in September - will be a kind of woodlouse summit in South Kensington, London. In that month, at the end of the Creating Sparks festival of science, zoologists, ecologists and schoolkids will begin to work out what they have learned about the distribution of one of Britain's most extraordinary species. </p> <p>Jill Nelson of the British Association for Advancement of Science is the director of the Creating Sparks festival. There have been mass experiments before but she wanted to involve kids in something that would be useful, she says. \"They may have been used as experimental animals themselves but they haven't actually been mini-researchers, if you like. So the idea was to do something real. The message we wanted to get across was about biodiversity and the fact that it is important to the UK and it isn't just about the Brazilian rainforest.\" </p> <p>So the architects of the scheme went for the woodlouse. Woodlice - also known to children and folklorists as tiggy-hogs, pill bugs, cheeselogs, chiggy pigs and rolypolies - are clean and safe and children aren't generally afraid to touch them. </p> <p>Woodlice exist everywhere in Britain. They scurry along on their 14 feet (seven pairs of legs) \"smelling\" their way with their antennae. Woodlice don't like things too cold or too hot, too wet or too dry. They don't like toxic soils or places with nothing much to eat. They munch at rotting wood and damaged foliage and, like earthworms, they make an enormous difference to the ecosystem. Their distribution and seasonal appearances will add up to a huge database for British scientists. </p> <p>Miranda Lowe of the Natural History Museum calls them an \"indicator species\". If they are in good shape, so are most of the wild things around them. And even though there are lots of isopods, kids can classify them. \"There are the runners, and they are generally narrow, smooth and move quite quickly,\" she says. \"There are the clingers which are quite broad and flat and slow, and there are the rollers, which roll themselves perfectly into a ball. Some of the runners can do that but they don't roll perfectly. And lastly there are the creepers, which are very slow.\" </p> <p>The field biologists in the back garden or the school playground will be in action from May, when the little crustaceans become less torpid, until September when they prepare for winter. The children will use a website to help them identify the species. They will get practice using a taxonomist's \"tree\" to get the genus and species right, and they will fill in a database about what they find, and when and where. If they do that just once, that will be valuable, says Jill Nelson. If they do it every week, that will be even better. Every time they enter data into the database, they will get feedback. </p> <p>\"The database will come back immediately and say: thank you for your data, that's very unusual, you have a something or other; or: that's just like three people down the road who have said the same thing.

      "bodyText": "The little one that rolls up into a perfect ball is Armadillidum vulgare, the common pill woodlouse. Porcellio scaber is the common rough woodlouse and the common shiny one is called Oniscus asellus. British schoolchildren are about to get to know them in fine detail, along with most of the 35 other common species of British terrestrial Isopoda, or woodlice. The schoolchildren will be taking part in a nationwide, six month-long internet-based experiment in biodiversity, taxonomy, systematics and field zoology and they will be doing it under rotting logs, in the rockery, and behind the compost heap. Next week is national science week, the 7,500-event jamboree of technology, engineering and boffinpower across the nation launched on Friday (March 17). In the middle of the week, a tiny group of isopod-addicts will hatch a mass-observation experiment that could, if necessary, absorb data from every schoolchild in the country. Walking With Woodlice is about to be outlined as a serious proposal for 22,000 science and nature teachers. It is designed to fit in with stages two and three of the national curriculum, so biologists from seven to 13 will have a stake in it. Its climax - roughly at the end of the woodlouse hunting season in September - will be a kind of woodlouse summit in South Kensington, London. In that month, at the end of the Creating Sparks festival of science, zoologists, ecologists and schoolkids will begin to work out what they have learned about the distribution of one of Britain's most extraordinary species. Jill Nelson of the British Association for Advancement of Science is the director of the Creating Sparks festival. There have been mass experiments before but she wanted to involve kids in something that would be useful, she says. \"They may have been used as experimental animals themselves but they haven't actually been mini-researchers, if you like. So the idea was to do something real. The message we wanted to get across was about biodiversity and the fact that it is important to the UK and it isn't just about the Brazilian rainforest.\" So the architects of the scheme went for the woodlouse. Woodlice - also known to children and folklorists as tiggy-hogs, pill bugs, cheeselogs, chiggy pigs and rolypolies - are clean and safe and children aren't generally afraid to touch them. Woodlice exist everywhere in Britain. They scurry along on their 14 feet (seven pairs of legs) \"smelling\" their way with their antennae. Woodlice don't like things too cold or too hot, too wet or too dry. They don't like toxic soils or places with nothing much to eat. They munch at rotting wood and damaged foliage and, like earthworms, they make an enormous difference to the ecosystem. Their distribution and seasonal appearances will add up to a huge database for British scientists. Miranda Lowe of the Natural History Museum calls them an \"indicator species\". If they are in good shape, so are most of the wild things around them. And even though there are lots of isopods, kids can classify them. \"There are the runners, and they are generally narrow, smooth and move quite quickly,\" she says. \"There are the clingers which are quite broad and flat and slow, and there are the rollers, which roll themselves perfectly into a ball. Some of the runners can do that but they don't roll perfectly. And lastly there are the creepers, which are very slow.\" The field biologists in the back garden or the school playground will be in action from May, when the little crustaceans become less torpid, until September when they prepare for winter. The children will use a website to help them identify the species. They will get practice using a taxonomist's \"tree\" to get the genus and species right, and they will fill in a database about what they find, and when and where. If they do that just once, that will be valuable, says Jill Nelson. If they do it every week, that will be even better. Every time they enter data into the database, they will get feedback. \"The database will come back immediately and say: thank you for your data, that's very unusual, you have a something or other; or: that's just like three people down the road who have said the same thing. It's interactive, it gives them the feeling they have just contributed to something big, and that what they have found matters. The system can cope with every kid in the country, if the kids are inclined.\" The Association for Science Education is backing the idea. The Natural History Museum is working on an interactive website that should be in business very soon. At the end of the event, there will be a scientific paper based on the data, says Jill Nelson. \"The teachers will be able to take it back to the classrooms and say: 'Look, you contributed to this, this is a published piece of science.' Whether it changes the world, I can't say, until we get there.\" Woodlice online",

In the reception class, one little girl has some earphones clamped to her head, a boy and a girl play race the snail, a clump of kids play with finger puppets, another group create Elmer the Elephant storybooks and a few just chill out and natter. Amid the ordered disorder, everyone is having a good time. </p> <p>West Grove's headteacher, Elaine Wilmot, believes that not all children learn in the same way. \"Some respond best to conventional aural and visual teaching methods, but others learn best through physical exploration,\" she says, \"and the key to maximising a child's potential is to tailor their education to their learning styles\". </p> <p>This approach is everything that Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector for Ofsted, detests. In his annual lecture at the end of last month, Woodhead put the boot into all new approaches to learning in a bid to reclaim the classroom values of the 1950s. To underline the point, he launched a personal attack on Bill Lucas, chief executive of the Campaign for Learning, an organisation that endorses West Grove's teaching methods. \"There's nothing really new,\" said Woodhead, dismissively. \"It does not justify the hype. It certainly does not justify Bill Lucas's confident assertion that learning to learn will be the skill for the next century.\" </p> <p>Lucas himself would almost certainly agree with Woodhead's assertion that there was nothing new in what he was saying. The Campaign is not hanging on to the latest, tenuous research; it is working from well-established scientific research by, amongst others, Howard Gardner and Susan Greenfield, into theories of multiple intelligences and how the brain works, which, when reduced to simple language, shows that people learn in different ways, that they respond best to high-challenge, low-threat environments, that we really only concentrate for 20 minutes at a time and most of us are almost permanently dehydrated.</p> <p>The implications are potentially seismic. Far from Woodhead's claim that modern practice already takes note of this research, a new MORI survey commissioned by the Campaign into young people's attitudes to learning suggests that the opposite is the case. Classroom activities are dominated by copying from the board or a book and listening to the teacher talk. What the pupils actually wanted was more balance, including group discussion and problem-solving, more computer time, and a more brain-friendly environment with background music and the freedom to wander round and get a glass of water. </p> <p>Many parents may be tempted to raise an eyebrow at the idea that children are the best judge of how they learn; my own would probably say they did best with unlimited sweets and no maths tests on Friday. But any scepticism is kicked to one side when you see the principles in action. </p> <p>In most schools, the sight of kiddies wandering around the classroom mid-lesson would be enough to send a teacher apoplectic and to get the children labelled disruptive. At West Grove it is positively encouraged. \"We want the children to explore for themselves how they learn best,\" says Wilmot. \"We start with what they can do; we observe them in action and then try to reframe ideas into methods and activities that make sense to them.\" </p> <p>Jack Newton, one of the reception teachers, explains how it works in practice. \"One four-year old boy is very into enclosures at the moment,\" he says. \"He's been playing with building blocks and his language is amazing. At one point he said, 'I'm putting this block here to increase the strength'. Another girl loves ordering things and has spent some time rearranging the books. I talk to them about what they're doing and try to get them to think about how it relates to numbers and language. I then try to suggest similar activities that will develop these skills in other ways.\" </p> <p>It's hardly the normal way of teaching the three Rs, but Wilmot is adamant that, amongst the creativity, the basics of phonics and numeracy are still hammered home - just more gently. West Grove is an average multicultural primary school; its pupils include those from emotionally and socially deprived backgrounds, children with special needs, and a smattering of children from well-off homes. But the achievement levels are anything but average. Tiffany, aged four, writes out the word elephant from memory, spelling it correctly; Joshua, also four, happily jots down a rudimentary sentence. Now you might expect one or two gifted children in any class, but many other members of the class are also working at this level. </p> <p>You find a similar story in year 1. By request of the parents, all children learn French and most can count to 30, identify the colours and can hold a basic conversation along the lines of \"Who are you? What's your name?\" etc. Wilmot reckons that most of the class already meet the key stage 1 assessment test a year ahead of schedule. West Grove was only established in 1998 and there are no classes above year 1, but the school has no intention of altering its approach as the demands of the curriculum increase with age. </p> <p>This may sound a bit gung-ho, but West Grove is hardly out on a limb. Business has long endorsed the theories of multiple intelligence, the Department for Education's Standards and Effectiveness committee has accepted the Campaign's ideas, and over 500 schools, including whole local education authorities, applied to be one of the 24 schools on the Campaign's Learning to Learn pilot scheme that starts this September. </p> <p>If Woodhead is not yet ready for the Campaign for Learning, West Grove is more than ready for Woodhead. The school has not yet received its first Ofsted inspection, but Wilmot insists that when it comes, the school will not change its practices one bit. And somehow you believe her.</p>",

At one point he said, 'I'm putting this block here to increase the strength'. Another girl loves ordering things and has spent some time rearranging the books. I talk to them about what they're doing and try to get them to think about how it relates to numbers and language. I then try to suggest similar activities that will develop these skills in other ways.\" It's hardly the normal way of teaching the three Rs, but Wilmot is adamant that, amongst the creativity, the basics of phonics and numeracy are still hammered home - just more gently. West Grove is an average multicultural primary school; its pupils include those from emotionally and socially deprived backgrounds, children with special needs, and a smattering of children from well-off homes. But the achievement levels are anything but average. Tiffany, aged four, writes out the word elephant from memory, spelling it correctly; Joshua, also four, happily jots down a rudimentary sentence. Now you might expect one or two gifted children in any class, but many other members of the class are also working at this level. You find a similar story in year 1. By request of the parents, all children learn French and most can count to 30, identify the colours and can hold a basic conversation along the lines of \"Who are you? What's your name?\" etc. Wilmot reckons that most of the class already meet the key stage 1 assessment test a year ahead of schedule. West Grove was only established in 1998 and there are no classes above year 1, but the school has no intention of altering its approach as the demands of the curriculum increase with age. This may sound a bit gung-ho, but West Grove is hardly out on a limb. Business has long endorsed the theories of multiple intelligence, the Department for Education's Standards and Effectiveness committee has accepted the Campaign's ideas, and over 500 schools, including whole local education authorities, applied to be one of the 24 schools on the Campaign's Learning to Learn pilot scheme that starts this September. If Woodhead is not yet ready for the Campaign for Learning, West Grove is more than ready for Woodhead. The school has not yet received its first Ofsted inspection, but Wilmot insists that when it comes, the school will not change its practices one bit. And somehow you believe her.",

      "body": "<p>When the chairman of the governors of Ripon grammar school peered through his glasses at the sheet of paper coughing from the fax machine he quickly realised that the opponents of comprehensive education had not merely won, but won very big indeed. The Yes camp - for change - had mustered 747 votes. The No campaign, organised not just by grammar school parents but by Ripon college, the former secondary modern, had doubled that to 1,493. </p> <p>But Judge Simon Grenfell may not have reckoned that, in a perverse way, the Ripon electorate of parents of primary schools \"feeding\" the grammar school had delivered a welcome result to the government. </p> <p>The government has two causes for satisfaction: one political and one educational. The political consequence flows from the government's attachment to the views of the Daily Mail and its readership, deemed to be the voice of middle England which voted Labour for the first time in 1997. The Daily Mail is attached to grammar schools. A string of contested reorganisations abolishing some of the 164 remaining grammar schools is not what Labour wants in the heartlands of its new electorate. </p> <p>But educationally Labour has been emphasising the performance of individual schools, as the social exclusion agenda has pushed into the field of learning. Implicitly, at least, the old argument about structures had become redundant. In Ripon, the argument for change by the Campaign for the Advancement of State Education (Case) had the air of existing in a time warp. Even the launch of the bid to raise the 587 signatures necessary to force a ballot on the future of the grammar school featuring Lord Hattersley had a distinctly pre-Blairite feel to it. </p> <p>Of course, Labour will face more chuntering about its working class heartlands. But the enthusiasm for comprehensive education has always come from Labour's \"polytechnic\", not its working-class supporters. Tony Blair is unlikely to be unduly perturbed by Hattersley's huffing and puffing: indeed, as a demonstration that New Labour has turned its back on the old agendas he may even welcome it, despite the inevitably flurries of backbench indignation. </p> <p>Labour could, of course, have engineered parental ballots to provide a much truer test of sentiment about selection. It could have required each local authority to put forward a scheme of re-organisation for its grammar schools and then required a referendum on that plan. At the very least it could have ensured that when a petition had secured a ballot a clear choice should lie before the parent-voters. </p> <p> It did neither. In Ripon the electorate consisted of parents in 15 feeder primary schools which had sent at least five children to the grammar over the previous three years. Neither the grammar school (roll 770) nor Ripon college (472) parents had a vote. Crucially the local authority kept out of the battle, but in a factual question and answer circular sent to parents it stated that a Yes vote would \"not necessarily\" ensure a single comprehensive school in Ripon. A scheme of reorganisation would follow a vote, not precede it, and would not be subject to parental endorsement. It was also clear that the government had made no provision for cash to fund a reorganisation. This enabled the No vote to argue that parents were being invited to take a leap in the dark. </p> <p>The same problem will apply if pro-comprehensive campaigners force ballots in local education authorities where the whole system is selective (there are only three selective secondary schools in North Yorkshire). Although the electorate will be the whole parent body rather than the bizarre micro-electorate of Ripon, they will still be voting for the ending of selection at the grammar schools rather than for a specific scheme of reorganisation. </p> <p>It must be clear that ballots in, say, Kent or Trafford or part of Birmingham within a year of the general election is not Millbank's idea of an appropriate ap\u00e9ritif before the main feast. David Blunkett may have said \"watch my lips\" but Labour's spin doctors will be watching the focus groups and a very big focus group has just spoken in Ripon. </p> <p>Of course there were special factors in Ripon. The Case campaigners failed to register the progress made over the past four years by the college, culminating in the recent award of technology college status. They projected a mind-set about education in Ripon which was out of date. When the grammar school and the college combined to argue for a No vote the Case campaign was marooned. It succeeded in adding only 160 votes to the number required to raise the petition in the first place over the entire (absurdly long) five weeks of the ballot. </p> <p>The government will no doubt take refuge in the argument that the choice has been devolved to parents. But David Blunkett's remarks over the weekend hardly suggests a government in sackcloth and ashes over the defeat of an idea that has been at the heart of Labour for the best part of half a century. Just 1,493 parents in Ripon may just have liberated Labour from its chains. </p> <p>\u0095 David Curry is Conservative MP for Skipton and Ripon.</p>",

The political consequence flows from the government's attachment to the views of the Daily Mail and its readership, deemed to be the voice of middle England which voted Labour for the first time in 1997. The Daily Mail is attached to grammar schools. A string of contested reorganisations abolishing some of the 164 remaining grammar schools is not what Labour wants in the heartlands of its new electorate. But educationally Labour has been emphasising the performance of individual schools, as the social exclusion agenda has pushed into the field of learning. Implicitly, at least, the old argument about structures had become redundant. In Ripon, the argument for change by the Campaign for the Advancement of State Education (Case) had the air of existing in a time warp. Even the launch of the bid to raise the 587 signatures necessary to force a ballot on the future of the grammar school featuring Lord Hattersley had a distinctly pre-Blairite feel to it. Of course, Labour will face more chuntering about its working class heartlands. But the enthusiasm for comprehensive education has always come from Labour's \"polytechnic\", not its working-class supporters. Tony Blair is unlikely to be unduly perturbed by Hattersley's huffing and puffing: indeed, as a demonstration that New Labour has turned its back on the old agendas he may even welcome it, despite the inevitably flurries of backbench indignation. Labour could, of course, have engineered parental ballots to provide a much truer test of sentiment about selection. It could have required each local authority to put forward a scheme of re-organisation for its grammar schools and then required a referendum on that plan. At the very least it could have ensured that when a petition had secured a ballot a clear choice should lie before the parent-voters. It did neither. In Ripon the electorate consisted of parents in 15 feeder primary schools which had sent at least five children to the grammar over the previous three years. Neither the grammar school (roll 770) nor Ripon college (472) parents had a vote. Crucially the local authority kept out of the battle, but in a factual question and answer circular sent to parents it stated that a Yes vote would \"not necessarily\" ensure a single comprehensive school in Ripon. A scheme of reorganisation would follow a vote, not precede it, and would not be subject to parental endorsement. It was also clear that the government had made no provision for cash to fund a reorganisation. This enabled the No vote to argue that parents were being invited to take a leap in the dark. The same problem will apply if pro-comprehensive campaigners force ballots in local education authorities where the whole system is selective (there are only three selective secondary schools in North Yorkshire). Although the electorate will be the whole parent body rather than the bizarre micro-electorate of Ripon, they will still be voting for the ending of selection at the grammar schools rather than for a specific scheme of reorganisation. It must be clear that ballots in, say, Kent or Trafford or part of Birmingham within a year of the general election is not Millbank's idea of an appropriate ap\u00e9ritif before the main feast. David Blunkett may have said \"watch my lips\" but Labour's spin doctors will be watching the focus groups and a very big focus group has just spoken in Ripon. Of course there were special factors in Ripon. The Case campaigners failed to register the progress made over the past four years by the college, culminating in the recent award of technology college status. They projected a mind-set about education in Ripon which was out of date. When the grammar school and the college combined to argue for a No vote the Case campaign was marooned. It succeeded in adding only 160 votes to the number required to raise the petition in the first place over the entire (absurdly long) five weeks of the ballot. The government will no doubt take refuge in the argument that the choice has been devolved to parents. But David Blunkett's remarks over the weekend hardly suggests a government in sackcloth and ashes over the defeat of an idea that has been at the heart of Labour for the best part of half a century. Just 1,493 parents in Ripon may just have liberated Labour from its chains. \u0095 David Curry is Conservative MP for Skipton and Ripon.",

From the autumn an internet portal called Hero will provide an information service to all those interested in UK higher education. Hero (Higher Education and Research Opportunities) is designed to guide anyone, from the student seeking a degree course to the small firm wanting help in developing a product, through the confusing array of thousands of existing academic websites. Researchers needing funding and businesses needing research and development will - the organisers hope - be put in touch, and universities will also have a chance to tell a wider public about their often hidden cultural riches - museums, music, drama and public lectures. No one has tried to draw the key information about a whole country's higher education system together in this way, although Australia markets its universities aggressively abroad via the internet. The steering group that has been planning the service has appointed the new media company, Epic, to design, launch and operate the service under contract.

      "body": "<p>Nothing could have prepared Barbara Goodman, a secretary in the law department of Leicester University, for the day she opened her office door and found herself face to face with a naked male student. He wasn't being threatening, however, just cracking up, and she felt not terror but sympathy for a \"boy\" who was simply not coping with the stresses and strains of university life. </p> <p>She regards him as one of the increasing numbers of students she sees in psychological difficulty. The pressure on students, she believes, is far greater than when she first took her job in the department 24 years ago. Some of them, for want of someone mature and comforting to turn to, turn to her. </p> <p>\"They'll come in quite briskly saying, 'I just want a word if you've got time,' and then all of a sudden you get the tears, they can't cope any more. Most of them think they're not coping with their studies, but when it comes out it could be all manner of things, relationship problems, financial worries, parental pressure, anxiety about jobs. These days they've got to get a 2:1 honours degree to get a training contract. When I first came they could have walked into a partnership with a third.\" </p> <p>Help is at hand, however, for staff like Barbara on the frontline of dealing with students. Leicester University, along with Nottingham, has produced guidance and training for staff facing students in trouble. Leicester's publication Helping Students in Difficulty is based on the largest ever UK survey into student psychological health, carried out by the university's Student Psychological Health Project team, which shows that at any one time 15% of students have mental health problems that might require professional help.</p> <p>As many universities have doubled or tripled student numbers without any commensurate growth in services, they are having to help growing numbers of students in psychological difficulty with fewer resources. Barbara Goodman feels that Leicester's staff guidance has come none too soon: \"The university has taken this on board in a strong way and it can do nothing but good.\" </p> <p>The survey is of 1,620 students, 70% of them second-year undergraduates and 72% of them under 21 years. It shows that 60% of students feel \"highly stressed\" or \"distracted\" by concerns over their ability to manage and complete course work and to set priorities and manage time. Just under half worry about their levels of confidence and ability to cope with sadness, depression and mood changes. Family problems and illness distract around 40%. </p> <p>In the past, the university tutorial system ensured that personal tutors would be in regular contact with their tutees and would get to know them well enough to be able to spot signs of strain. These days, huge hikes in staff-student ratios mean the tutorial system struggles to survive, and students may go through their entire degree course without regular and continuing personal contact with an academic supervisor. At the same time, financial pressure, requiring that many students work to meet their costs, and the introduction of modular courses which lead to a continuous roll of coursework deadlines, requires students to be more independent and robust. For a significant number, the extra strains can precipitate psychological disorders. </p> <p> The consensus among university counsellors is that the severity of emotional and behavioural disturbance among university students is increasing. The Leicester survey provides much-needed evidence to back this up. Also, problems such as depression, schizophrenia and eating disorders are likely to be in their most acute phase from 16 to 25. </p> <p>The Leicester guide, written by Annie Grant, director of the university's educational development and support centre, has created an enormous amount of interest from within the university as well as nationally and in the US. </p> <p>\"I have been asked to talk at more departmental meetings and have had more feedback from this than anything else I have done,\" she says. \"I think there is a crisis of confidence in staff as to how to deal with these problems.\" </p> <p>While the guide has been written principally for personal tutors - still one of the first ports of call for students reluctant to approach counselling or clinical services - departments have been encouraged to supply copies to all staff who come into contact with students, including secretaries, technicians, porters, security staff and cleaners. </p> <p>It outlines the kind of difficulties students may face and provides practical and clear advice to help staff respond to them. It also includes guidance on when a tutor should deal with a problem personally and when to refer the student to a member of the health, medical or counselling services. </p> <p>On the back of the Leicester initiative, which is the largest of eight university projects on mental health funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals is circulating its own draft guidelines on the subject. It is also launching a study into student suicide. </p> <p>Catriona Walker, head of Leicester's counselling services, says demand for the service is growing \"year on year\", and that last year nearly 500 students used the service. Many had panic attacks, eating disorders or depression caused by anxiety about coursework or exams, money, their families or feeling worthless. </p> <p>One result of widening access, says Walker, is that universities are taking in more students with poorer backgrounds. The effect of the increase in family breakdown is also being felt. A 1998 study by the mental health charity Mind into the effect of family life on the mental health of children and young people said that poverty and family discord seemed to be the most important factors in increasing the risk of mental health problems. </p> <p>In their report last spring, the heads of university counselling services said there are now many students with no stable home to return to, and the level of support required by such students is often higher than those with a \"traditional\" stable family background. Strains on the National Health Service and Care in the Community policies mean that some student counselling services have had difficulty establishing medical responsibility for students with severe mental health problems. </p> <p>According to Grant, the issue for tutors with heavy work loads is how to help students in psychological distress effectively and how to recognise the limits of their own knowledge and responsibilities. Jeremy Levesley, a senior lecturer in maths and computer studies who takes pride in the pastoral support he gives to students, says that difficulties often arise when he is approached by students reluctant to go to counselling. At the moment he finds himself uncertain how best to help a student whose work is suffering as a result of family illness and who will not seek help other than to talk to him. \"She wants to get through on her own merits and that's a difficult problem for me. I find that blokes, especially, will try to tough it out when they need help, and it's hard to know what to do because I can get them to open up to me, but not to go elsewhere. </p> <p>\"Only this morning I had a girl saying she just couldn't motivate herself to work, and that she 'couldn't think of a good reason why she wasn't sleeping'. Students quickly get into a hole, or start to feel out of control with all the assessment these days. Often there seems to be no let up, no way out.\" </p> <p>He praised the university for setting out a staff plan of action for students in trouble. He said: \"I think it's important that we know what our responsibilities are, and that we're all working from the same hymn sheet.\"</p> <p><strong>Heart of the matter</strong></p> <p><strong> Kate Ellinor</strong>, a 21-year-old archaeology student in her 2nd year, spent a whole evening recently trying to persuade an \"incredibly stressed\" flatmate to come out of a locked room: \"He's very quiet and introverted, and he worries about things all the time. It's all just going round and round in his mind. I'm really worried about him.</p> <p>\"It's easy to feel very alone at university and have no one to turn to. I work in a bar three nights a week to earn money, and I don't get in until 2am sometimes, and I get really exhausted. I've just had my first set of exam results, and so far I'm on for a 2:2 and I feel stressed about that.</p> <p>\"I'm the first to go to university in my immediate family, but my uncle went and got a first-class degree and my cousin got a first, and I feel under a lot of pressure. But I'm a real strong believer in keeping in touch with my family and friends back at home.</p> <p>\"When people start uni they think they are starting a new life, but they shouldn't neglect their home life. That's where they will find their main support.</p> <p>\"It's sometimes difficult to pick up signs when someone's in trouble at university because you haven't known them that long. I've an old friend, I've known her since she was nine, and she's at art school and has become bulimic. It was obvious to me that something was wrong, but her friends at art school haven't a clue. They think she's great and lively and having a good time.\" </p> <p><strong> Robyn Knox</strong>, 22, a final-year European Studies student, said she reached a very low point in her second year: \"At first it's OK because it's all new, but you can start to feel very alone. A lot of students feel they have no one that knows them personally orunderstands them. I met my personal tutor yesterday for the first time this academic year. I did go through times when I just wasn't interested in anything, when getting up was a real struggle, and I missed lectures.\"</p> <p><strong>Trouble brewing</strong></p> <p><strong> What to watch out for:</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 A change in appearance - for instance, weight change or a change in behaviour </p> <p><strong> Is the student:</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Failing to complete coursework <br> \u0095 Doing too much work <br> \u0095 Missing classes <br> \u0095 Tense or irritable <br> \u0095 Sad or miserable <br> \u0095 Behaving erratically <br> \u0095 Unkempt <br> \u0095 Smelling of alcohol or cannabis <br> \u0095 Withdrawn or very quiet <br> \u0095 Agitated or very loud <br> \u0095 Talking incoherently </p> <p><strong> What to do:</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 Assess whether the problem is urgent - for instance, whether there is a risk of suicide, self-harm or harm to others.

The centre, part of a $1bn building project, will be devoted primarily to issues of mutual Asian-American interest. Janice Bellace, currently the deputy dean of the Wharton School, has been appointed the inaugural president of Singapore Management University. She will also be director of its postgraduate research centre. Tan Chin Tiong, the provost, describes the university as the newest and best example of what he calls the \"new American paradigm\" in Singaporean higher education. \"We're taking on the American mindset for management education,\" he says, \"whether it be in the area of health care, hospitality, or whatever.\" How long will it be for it completely to take hold? \"Five or six years,\" Tan confidently replies. To underline the perception of American influence on universities in Singapore, two years ago, prime minister Goh Chok Tong began encouraging institutions here to market themselves as \"the Harvard and MIT of Asia\" with Singapore itself starring as \"the Boston of the East\". His comments came on the back of a ministry of education survey's findings that many graduates had difficulty working independently and required, in Goh's terse words, \"too much hand holding\", taken to mean a lack of sufficiently creative and innovative thought. For the first time, educators began worrying aloud that Singapore might not be producing enough high-calibre graduates - particularly in the strategically important areas of medicine and engineering - to help the country maintain its position as one of south-east Asia's strongest-performing economies. The British system inherited by Singapore from its colonial overlords \"was still good in terms of its depth, rigour, and quality-control\", says Dr Lim of the National University. \"But the American system, we now believe, is good for its flexibility, scope and choice. \"What we've developed is really something of a hybrid,\" he continues. \"We have gone around the world, taking the best and synthesising it to our needs and particular situation.\"",

      "body": "<p>Jason Drummond has been ranked as Britain's wealthiest young entrepreneur by a newspaper survey. </p> <p>The unexpected news was broken to the 30-year-old businessman on Sunday morning - as he was trying to stop his young son chasing a pig around a Surrey farmyard. </p> <p>A telephone call, from a friend, told Mr Drummond that his 64% shareholding in Virtual Internet, an Aim-listed internet domain name, brand and trademark protection group, valued him at \u00a3123m - \u00a351m ahead of second placed Robert Bonnier, chief executive of Scoot.com. </p> <p>\"It was nice to hear but a fairly farcical situation to find out in,\" Mr Drummond said. \"To be honest, though, the money doesn't bother me too much, it's the challenge of growing the business that I like. I'll keep on going for as long as I enjoy it.\" </p> <p>To emphasise his point, Mr Drummond had wiped the manure off his shoes, slipped back into his suit and returned to the Square Mile by 7.30 the following morning to outline the next stage of Virtual Internet's growth strategy. </p> <p>He said yesterday that the company plans to move from Aim, where it listed in January last year, to the main market and raise \u00a333m to fund both domestic and international expansion.

      "bodyText": "Jason Drummond has been ranked as Britain's wealthiest young entrepreneur by a newspaper survey. The unexpected news was broken to the 30-year-old businessman on Sunday morning - as he was trying to stop his young son chasing a pig around a Surrey farmyard. A telephone call, from a friend, told Mr Drummond that his 64% shareholding in Virtual Internet, an Aim-listed internet domain name, brand and trademark protection group, valued him at \u00a3123m - \u00a351m ahead of second placed Robert Bonnier, chief executive of Scoot.com. \"It was nice to hear but a fairly farcical situation to find out in,\" Mr Drummond said. \"To be honest, though, the money doesn't bother me too much, it's the challenge of growing the business that I like. I'll keep on going for as long as I enjoy it.\" To emphasise his point, Mr Drummond had wiped the manure off his shoes, slipped back into his suit and returned to the Square Mile by 7.30 the following morning to outline the next stage of Virtual Internet's growth strategy. He said yesterday that the company plans to move from Aim, where it listed in January last year, to the main market and raise \u00a333m to fund both domestic and international expansion. The planned placing is ambitious, given Virtual Internet's market capitalisation of \u00a3198m, but broker Hoare Govett is fully underwriting it and early institutional demand has been strong. \"My diary for a week of presentations was filled in an hour,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "One of the most notorious rebel Chechen field commanders has been captured by Russia's secret police and imprisoned in Moscow, giving a much needed propaganda boost to the army's campaign in the separatist region. The triumphant announcement of Salman Raduyev's imprisonment comes at a convenient time for the Kremlin, troubled by fresh setbacks to the final stages of its battle to control Chechnya. Describing Mr Raduyev as \"one of the most odious bandit leaders\", Russia's acting president, Vladimir Putin, monopolised the headlines yesterday in praising Russia's security forces for the capture. Preparations for the funerals of an entire company of 84 Russian paratroops killed during fighting in the Chechen mountains last week - when Russia suffered some of its heaviest casualties of the war - were overshadowed by the announcement. Mr Raduyev, leader of a group of fighters known as the Lone Wolves, masterminded a hostage-taking attack in 1996 during Russia's previous war with Chechnya. The attack caused the army severe embarrassment when its attempts to crush the operation resulted in the deaths of about 100 hostages and Russian soldiers. Mr Raduyev escaped. He has also admitted being behind two railway bomb attacks in the north Caucasus in the past two years and claimed to have organised an attempt to assassinate the Georgian president, Eduard Shevardnadze. Related by marriage to the late Chechen leader Dzhokar Dudayev, Mr Raduyev rose swiftly in the ranks but is regarded among Chechens as a loose cannon. His influence has recently waned owing to internal feuds between rival field commanders. His arrest was the first time Russian forces had managed to capture a senior rebel leader since the war began in September. Seriously disfigured during an assassination attempt in 1995, Mr Raduyev hides his face behind a large beard and tinted sunglasses. After the attempt on his life, he disappeared for several months, prompting the Russian army to report - with evident relief - that he was dead. When he reappeared a few months later, so badly scarred that he was virtually unrecognisable, he was dubbed \"the man who came back from the dead\". Recently he has had extensive plastic surgery on his face, some of it carried out in Germany, and is said to have signed an agreement pledging not to take revenge on his doctors should any part of the operation have gone wrong. State television showed the Chechen fighter, clean shaven and deprived of his glasses, being interrogated last night at Moscow's high-security Lefortovo prison. While maximum publicity was squeezed from Mr Raduyev's arrest, there was no disguising the fact that Russia was making little progress yesterday in its attempt to seize the village of Komsomolskoye, in the mountainous south of Chechnya, the last remaining Chechen-controlled region. The Russian army has surrounded the village and continues its relentless bombardment of the settlement, despite the presence of civilians. A week of fighting, air raids and shelling has left the village in ruins. Russia yesterday came under renewed criticism for its excessively brutal campaign in Chechnya from a council of Europe delegation, concluding a brief visit to the region. Calling for an immediate ceasefire and a negotiated settlement, the delegation leader, Lord Judd, said he had been \"deeply disturbed by the distress and trauma suffered by civilians as a result of indiscriminate and disproportionate force by the Russian military\". He added: \"It is beyond comprehension that at the beginning of the 21st century a European city like Grozny could be systematically destroyed by the forces of its own government.\"",

He refused to divulge \"confidential details\" of the deal with the government, but said it would be a good deal for Mr Byers. Under a previous arrangement with the company, the government was repaid almost twice the \u00a3250m it had invested and would continue to benefit through a further royalty on each Airbus A320 delivered.</p> <p>Sir Richard was cautious about how many models would be built. Airbus would start slowly, but had plans to build between 300 and 600 in the first 10 years of production. This is expected to be split at Airbus's two plants at Hamburg and Toulouse, with the wings built at Filton.</p> <p>Sir Ken Jackson, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineeering and Electrical Union, which represents the majority of workers at BAe, said: \"This is no charity handout. The investment is repayable with interest, making it good news for the taxpayer as well as industry. It's the right decision for Airbus and the UK.</p> <p>\"It will put us at the top of the table because it will upgrade our skills and technology. It will have major economic benefits for many years.\"</p> <p>Mr Byers said he was confident that the deal would be approved by the European Union, and did not contravene an agreement reached in 1992 with Airbus's main competitor, Boeing. The American manufacturer receives aid from the US government for research and development.</p> <p>An EU spokesman said the loan would need Brussels approval if BAe was receiving preferential treatment for the financial terms on offer. He said a decision was unlikely to be made for several months, allthough both Mr Byers and BAe believe that it is copper-bottomed.</p> <p>There was no immediate reaction from Boeing, although it has always made it clear that it is not about to join Airbus in the race to build the world's largest aircraft.</p> <p>Airbus and Boeing are engaged in bitter rivalry. Since its formation 25 years ago by Britain, France, Germany and Spain, Airbus has gradually started to compete with its American rival. Airbus says now has 55% of the world's civil aircraft production and contributes \u00a31bn to Britain's trade balance.</p> <p>Airbus believes that airlines will want to buy as many as 1,500 of the larger-style planes over the next 20 years and that the A3XX could represent around half of these orders.</p>",

He refused to divulge \"confidential details\" of the deal with the government, but said it would be a good deal for Mr Byers. Under a previous arrangement with the company, the government was repaid almost twice the \u00a3250m it had invested and would continue to benefit through a further royalty on each Airbus A320 delivered. Sir Richard was cautious about how many models would be built. Airbus would start slowly, but had plans to build between 300 and 600 in the first 10 years of production. This is expected to be split at Airbus's two plants at Hamburg and Toulouse, with the wings built at Filton. Sir Ken Jackson, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineeering and Electrical Union, which represents the majority of workers at BAe, said: \"This is no charity handout. The investment is repayable with interest, making it good news for the taxpayer as well as industry. It's the right decision for Airbus and the UK. \"It will put us at the top of the table because it will upgrade our skills and technology. It will have major economic benefits for many years.\" Mr Byers said he was confident that the deal would be approved by the European Union, and did not contravene an agreement reached in 1992 with Airbus's main competitor, Boeing. The American manufacturer receives aid from the US government for research and development. An EU spokesman said the loan would need Brussels approval if BAe was receiving preferential treatment for the financial terms on offer. He said a decision was unlikely to be made for several months, allthough both Mr Byers and BAe believe that it is copper-bottomed. There was no immediate reaction from Boeing, although it has always made it clear that it is not about to join Airbus in the race to build the world's largest aircraft. Airbus and Boeing are engaged in bitter rivalry. Since its formation 25 years ago by Britain, France, Germany and Spain, Airbus has gradually started to compete with its American rival. Airbus says now has 55% of the world's civil aircraft production and contributes \u00a31bn to Britain's trade balance. Airbus believes that airlines will want to buy as many as 1,500 of the larger-style planes over the next 20 years and that the A3XX could represent around half of these orders.",

Signor Amato was at ease with everything from EU migration patterns to the global impact of e-commerce: a liberal, unsectarian, undefensive European, with a cultural range of reference that stretches effortlessly to Nashville.

But these are mere nuances, beside the undiplomatically straightforward opinion of the US treasury secretary, Larry Summers, who has taken command of Washington's IMF vote.

The introduction of such voluntary return programmes has been designed by the European commission to aid EU states who have difficulty enforcing expulsion orders against those who fail to qualify for refugee status. The programme is also in tended as a \"credible and humane alternative to compulsory repatriation\". The scheme is part of a European refugee fund to be created later this year, following agreement at the special EU home affairs council in Tampere, Finland, in October which was attended by Tony Blair and Jack Straw. About \u00a323m has been set aside to finance the fund in its first year of operation. As Britain was second in the European league table for the number of asylum applicants for both 1998 and 1999 behind Germany, it is likely that the British taxpayer will benefit from the scheme. The fund also includes a cash reserve to help spread the burden of paying to cope with a sudden mass influx of refugees, as happened last summer during the Kosovo crisis. The internal EU paper seen by the Guardian said there were differences in the asylum burden borne by each EU state because of \"the different directions taken by the flows of persons in search of protection and the uneven distribution of populations of refugees and displaced persons in the Euro pean Union\". A proposal suggests that the burden is shared according to how many asylum seekers and refugees each country has taken in the past three years. The detailed plan drawn up by the European commission said that measures such as the introduction of voluntary return programmes are necessary to ensure that those whose asylum applications fail are returned to their country of origin \"in order to safeguard asylum as a permanent and credible institution\". The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdicombe, has claimed that as many as 60,000 failed asylum seekers have \"disappeared\" in Britain in the past 10 years. The voluntary return programmes will include giving the people involved reliable information about the areas they have come from as well as material assistance to help them prepare for their return home. The immigration minister, Barbara Roche, has told MPs studying the plan that the government has reservations about the way the European refugee fund would operate.

      "body": "<p>The government's decision to invest \u00a3530m in the production of a new super-jumbo aircraft capable of carrying up to 900 passengers is a welcome act of faith in a bold European project. Even though it is possible, even probable, that the announcement had something to do with the gestating troubles in Labour's heartlands, that would only have affected the timing not the decision itself. The news that 8,000 new jobs could be created at BAe's factories in Broughton, north Wales, Filton, near Bristol and, more to the point, Prestwick in Scotland (close to where the Ayr byelection will take place on Thursday) is a highly convenient bonus, but not the real point. The government, for all its shilly-shallying over further European integration, is prepared to back a genuine pan-European project.</p> <p>The original plans to build a European aircraft to take on the divine right of Boeing to dominate the world market was very risky. It would not have happened without public money. It would almost certainly not have been allowed to be built today because governments have recoiled from direct involvement with industry. Money is only forthcoming today because the Airbus has been a brilliant industrial (if not yet financial) success story. It now claims half of the world market for passenger aircraft, a phenomenon that would have seemed impossible years ago. But at that time Europe was playing catch-up. Now it is seizing the initiative by planning to build the next generation of \"jumbo\" jumbos ahead of a procrastinating Boeing. This may be the sign of an emerging European self-confidence. One of the very few other areas of major cooperation is mobile phones where the hammering out of a common standard (GSM) for mobiles is one of the main reasons Europe has a technological lead over America.</p> <p>BAe (formerly British Aerospace) will build the wings for the planned A3XX range that could include gymnasiums and restaurants. They will be able to carry up to 900 passengers depending on the configuration. There is an understandable worry about aircraft getting bigger and bigger. Although they are also getting safer, it is inevitable that when an accident eventually happens it will be on a scale hitherto almost unimaginable. That said, the new range will use 20% less fuel per passenger and may also delay airport expansion by using existing slots more intensively.</p> <p>The speed with which the government extended low interest (repayable) loans is in telling contrast with its reluctance to permit cheap loans (in the form of bond finance) for improvements to the London underground system. The treasury will doubtless argue that in the case of the Airbus it trusts the management to use the money effectively, but not the management of the London tube. Either way there is clearly a role still for public money in risky but important long-term projects. Almost 30 years ago the (Conservative) government baled out Roll-Royce and gave it money to fund the RB211 range of engines, derivatives of which are still with us today, and may even power many of the new European super-jumbos if they are built. Rolls never became vastly profitable but the public money generated benefits to the economy far beyond the balance sheet. The Airbus has an urgent duty to publish proper commercial accounts so taxpayers can see exactly where their money is going. But you do not have to be a genius to predict that the Airbus will probably still be around when some of today's fashionable dot.com companies are no more than memories preserved as case studies in business schools.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government's decision to invest \u00a3530m in the production of a new super-jumbo aircraft capable of carrying up to 900 passengers is a welcome act of faith in a bold European project. Even though it is possible, even probable, that the announcement had something to do with the gestating troubles in Labour's heartlands, that would only have affected the timing not the decision itself. The news that 8,000 new jobs could be created at BAe's factories in Broughton, north Wales, Filton, near Bristol and, more to the point, Prestwick in Scotland (close to where the Ayr byelection will take place on Thursday) is a highly convenient bonus, but not the real point. The government, for all its shilly-shallying over further European integration, is prepared to back a genuine pan-European project. The original plans to build a European aircraft to take on the divine right of Boeing to dominate the world market was very risky. It would not have happened without public money. It would almost certainly not have been allowed to be built today because governments have recoiled from direct involvement with industry. Money is only forthcoming today because the Airbus has been a brilliant industrial (if not yet financial) success story. It now claims half of the world market for passenger aircraft, a phenomenon that would have seemed impossible years ago. But at that time Europe was playing catch-up. Now it is seizing the initiative by planning to build the next generation of \"jumbo\" jumbos ahead of a procrastinating Boeing. This may be the sign of an emerging European self-confidence. One of the very few other areas of major cooperation is mobile phones where the hammering out of a common standard (GSM) for mobiles is one of the main reasons Europe has a technological lead over America. BAe (formerly British Aerospace) will build the wings for the planned A3XX range that could include gymnasiums and restaurants. They will be able to carry up to 900 passengers depending on the configuration. There is an understandable worry about aircraft getting bigger and bigger. Although they are also getting safer, it is inevitable that when an accident eventually happens it will be on a scale hitherto almost unimaginable. That said, the new range will use 20% less fuel per passenger and may also delay airport expansion by using existing slots more intensively. The speed with which the government extended low interest (repayable) loans is in telling contrast with its reluctance to permit cheap loans (in the form of bond finance) for improvements to the London underground system. The treasury will doubtless argue that in the case of the Airbus it trusts the management to use the money effectively, but not the management of the London tube. Either way there is clearly a role still for public money in risky but important long-term projects. Almost 30 years ago the (Conservative) government baled out Roll-Royce and gave it money to fund the RB211 range of engines, derivatives of which are still with us today, and may even power many of the new European super-jumbos if they are built. Rolls never became vastly profitable but the public money generated benefits to the economy far beyond the balance sheet. The Airbus has an urgent duty to publish proper commercial accounts so taxpayers can see exactly where their money is going. But you do not have to be a genius to predict that the Airbus will probably still be around when some of today's fashionable dot.com companies are no more than memories preserved as case studies in business schools.",

      "bodyText": "Germany's new candidate to run the International Monetary Fund won the unanimous backing of EU governments yesterday, pressurising the United States to resist turning the selection process into a farce by refusing to support him. Horst K\u00f6hler, head of the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, was endorsed by all 15 member states at a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels. In a statement, he hailed the move as decisive in his candidacy to succeed Michel Camdessus as the IMF's managing director. \"It is a crucial step towards establishing the necessary support of the broad majority of IMF shareholders,\" K\u00f6hler said. The US blocked Europe's first choice for the job, Caio Koch-Weser, and has refused to discuss the merits of K\u00f6hler until EU governments adopted a common position on his candidacy. Now that they have rallied behind him, Hans Eichel, Germany's finance minister, said he would be speaking to President Clinton about the EBRD chief last night. Having humiliated the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, by rejecting Koch- Weser, Germany's deputy finance minister, few observers expect the president to risk a major diplomatic row by vetoing his second choice. But Larry Summers, US treasury secretary, is understood to be taking a hard line against K\u00f6hler. Like Koch-Weser, K\u00f6hler, 57, is seen as an extremely able bureaucrat but lacks the political profile some consider necessary to run the world's most powerful financial institution. In his time at the German finance ministry in the early 1990s, K\u00f6hler was instrumental in German unification and the decision to merge the two currencies at a one-for-one rate. He was also closely involved in supporting Russia in the aftermath of the break-up of the Soviet Union and played a key role in negotiating the Maastricht Treaty on European economic and monetary union before taking over the helm of the EBRD 18 months ago. Italian Treasury Minister Giuliano Amato, who is touted as a potential compromise candidate if K\u00f6hler is rejected, said he did not think Clinton will block K\u00f6hler. \"I don't think it will happen,\" Amato said. Schr\u00f6der, who has staked his personal reputation on a German running the IMF, vowed to press K\u00f6hler's candidacy hard. \"We, and above all the [European Union] presidency, as it has assured us, will work intensively to achieve [a consensus with the US],\" he told a news conference in Berlin. Portuguese prime minister, Antonio Guterres, in Berlin for talks with Schr\u00f6der, said: \"I always said the success of this candidacy is an enormous test of responsibility in the transatlantic relationship. I think it is a very important element for that. And we will all work together for that purpose.\" French finance minister Christian Sautter said K\u00f6hler's experience in dealing with eastern Europe could prove invaluable to the IMF in the period following the Russian presidential elections which take place a week on Sunday. German government sources said the IMF executive committee may hold a first vote on K\u00f6hler's candidacy later this week.",

If we can buy help with our earnings, it strips housework of its political meaning - though there is still a need for sexual politics to kick up the backside those men who are happy for their wives to bring in 50% of the household money but still avoid doing their share of the chores. That said, it seems to me a cheering sign of advanced feminism that some women can stand up and say doing housework - if it's on our terms - can be as much fun as going to the gym or walking the dog. It is not progress to feel the onus is on us to prove we are dynamic, cutting-edge women by zipping around outside the home. Today's sisters can afford to be seen polishing a door knob.",

Cassie Bayly, 18, and Diana Bayly, 14, both musicians, have been battling to prove that they were the children of Akihisa Yukawa, a millionaire executive of Sumitomo Bank. He died on August 12 1985, when the Japan Airlines Boeing 747 on which he was travelling crashed into a mountain north-west of Tokyo, killing 520 of the 524 people on board. He was married to a Japanese woman but had been involved with the girls' mother, Susanne Bayly, 43, for almost 10 years when he was killed. Ms Bayly had kept their romance secret to spare his family public disgrace but broke her silence last year for the sake of her daughters' education. Cassie, a pianist studying at the Royal College of Music, and Diana, who wants to be a concert violinist, lack funds to pay for their tuition. Mr Yukawa's son and heir has refused to acknowledge his half-sisters and cut off all payments to Ms Bayly.

Sebastian Nokes, a 34-year-old Old Etonian, successfully overturned claims by his former employers, Credit Suisse First Boston, that he was ineligible to apply for reinstatement or compensation under arcane and \"relatively uncharted\" legislation at an industrial tribunal in Stratford, east London. But he must now wait until June to seek redress. In a separate action, he will also claim he was unfairly dismissed and suffered racial discrimination. Yesterday the reinstatement committee panel at the tribunal heard that Mr Nokes, from Barbican, east London, joined CSFB in February 1998 and worked as vice-president of its strategic planning department, earning \u00a370,000 plus bonuses each year. But his career with the bank ended after the flight lieutenant with the Royal Auxiliary Air Force was called up on permanent service in April 1999. Within three months he was informed he would be made redundant, and after finishing his military service in August he was sacked. Yesterday Jeremy Johnson, for Mr Nokes, told the tribunal the bank had shown a \"cynical disregard\" for the reserve forces (safeguard of employment) act - the law to protect the jobs of reservists under which Mr Nokes is claiming reinstatement. He added that there was \"plainly a public interest\" in ensuring such a law was upheld. \"Membership these days is entirely voluntary and there's plainly a public interest in seeking volunteers to the reserve forces in ensuring the protection of their employment is effective,\" he said. But Martin Palmer, for CSFB, told the hearing Mr Nokes's redundancy had nothing to do with his call-up service. The bank will claim he was warned of the risk of being sacked before embarking on active service. After the hearing Mr Nokes's solicitor, Julian Fidler, said he and his client were \"encouraged\" the panel committee's chairman, who had described the rarely-used act as \"relatively uncharted waters\", had ruled it was applicable. \"It's been found today the 1985 act does apply and the application was also made in time.

The other awards went to: \u0095 Joe Smith, 65, of Deal, Kent, who last September became the oldest Briton to swim the Channel; \u0095 John Harmer, 69, from Cheltenham, who dived into the flooded river Chelt and saved Sue Colling whose car was being swept along; \u0095 Paul Stableforth, 65, from Gower, Glamorgan, a retired surgeon and non-swimmer, who helped save an injured fellow yacht race competitor; \u0095 Barry Sessions, 52, an oyster fisherman from Lustleigh, Devon, who rescued Turkish earthquake survivors; \u0095 Shirley McKiernon, 63, a tour manager, of Bledlow Ridge, Buckinghamshire, who helped holidaymakers on a sinking cruise ship; \u0095 Brian Jones, 52, of Erlestoke, Wiltshire, who with Bertrand Piccard became the first to navigate the globe in a balloon in March last year.

But barely two years after its opening, the Hall for Cornwall, a \u00a36m venture which boasts the Prince of Wales as its patron, risks abandoning its ideals and selling-out in a final attempt to avoid bankruptcy. This week the arts council announced a \u00a3200,000 rescue package for the county's cultural flagship, but only on condition its artistic director - one of the men behind its conception - and general manager get the boot in a cost-cutting exercise. The redundancies have inflamed passions among Cornwall's vibrant artistic community, with the dismissal of Chris Warner, who co-founded the trust behind the scheme 13 years ago, and Tim German, a former Welsh National Opera singer widely credited with expanding its education programme, being seen as scapegoating by a London-based quango ignorant of the problems of a fiercely independent but impoverished county. Mr Warner has been gagged from speaking to the press by the threat of losing his redundancy payment, but describes feeling \"shock, outrage and now anger\". \"He feels as if he's been run over,\" added his partner, Beverly Skiltern. Mr German, the general manager, who is considering seeking legal advice, is still bemused by a sacking which, the trust's chairman Dennis Arbon has publicly insisted, bore no relation to their capabilities. \"We've been told we've done nothing wrong,\" he added. \"We haven't been given a reason for why this has happened beyond that the arts council has demanded it. We've just been made scapegoats.\" The arts council, which as part of its rescue package negotiated with local author-ities and the regional arts board, south west arts, is demanding a single director combining both roles be appointed. The hall, which has been haemorrhaging up to \u00a3300,000 a year since its November 1997 opening, is in no position to be sentimental about the sackings, it insists. \"Obviously we regret anyone needs to be made redundant in this process, but this goes beyond personalities,\" said its spokeswoman Caroline Leech. \"It's about the survival of a good venue in the national jigsaw and we have to look at the best way in which this can happen.\" The suggestion is that, while both men had the artistic vision demanded to ensure an eclectic range of nationally-acclaimed performers - from the violinist Tamsin Little and English National Opera to the Royal Ballet, Van Morrison and Lenny Henry - attended the converted grade two-listed Victorian building in Truro, they lacked the business acumen to see it flourish. \"Like so many businesses, you have different phases and different requirements,\" said Mr Arbon, himself a retired businessman. \"Chris Warner and Tim German have superb artistic capabilities but the arts council required the skills and abilities of someone very different.\" The hall's immense financial difficulties - a \u00a3250,000 contingency fund was eradicated once conversion costs spiralled by \u00a3750,000 over budget - cannot be laid at the men's door. The hall had tried to do something no other non-commercial arts venue in Britain had achieved: break even without looking to the local authorities or arts council for revenue funding. \"We realised that's impossible,\" admitted Mr German, who said similar-sized venues were subsidised to the tune of \u00a3500,000 a year. In addition, it was crippled by problems posed by Cornwall: with one in four unemployed out of season and the average salary 25% below the national average, ticket prices could never be high; with less than 500,000 people in the whole county runs have been short, leading to increased costs for constructing and breaking down sets; and with a poor transport infrastructure, the venue could not recoup much from the bar.

At one point Nigel Flack got within feet of newsreader Anna Ford as he threatened to take the station off the air and kill anyone who tried to stop him. Flack, 21, who later admitted planning to \"have it out\" with new BBC director general Greg Dyke, was finally overpowered by staff. But before he was subdued he caused damage running into thousands of pounds at the Television Centre at Shepherds Bush, west London, Middlesex Guildhall crown court was told. A security officer and a cameraman who tried to overpower him were slightly injured. Flack, of Camberley, Surrey, admitted one count of affray and two of common assault last September. Judge Simon Smith told the Middlesex university student that he was clearly mentally ill and needed treatment. After \"careful consideration\" he and the two magistrates sitting with him had decided that an order needed to be made under the mental health act allowing him to be detained \"without limit of time\". Flack not only had little insight into his condition but there was a real risk he would not continue with his medication if left unsupervised. The court heard that despite tighter security imposed at the Television Centre after the murder of presenter Jill Dando outside her home in Fulham, west London, Flack was able to force his way through electronically controlled turnstiles and run up to the second floor. There he picked up a coffee table and hurled it through a floor-to-ceiling plate glass window leading to the \"secure\" news centre.

They include Serena Doshi of Liv4Now, Mark Kotecha of Net Interlink, and Amir Ahmed of Ocean Home Shopping. The youngest entry is Kashif Ahmed Ahmed, who at 25 runs the Laundry clothing label and is part of the Joe Bloggs label. Fashion was one of the highest earning sectors at \u00a3840m with high street names such as New Look, Bay Trading and Ciro Citterio. Food brought in more at \u00a3945.8m with companies such as Tilda Rice, Noon Products and Pataks Spices. Some 154 of the 200 live in the south-east or London, 24 in the north-west, 14 in the West Midlands, and 11 in Scotland. The four oldest are each aged 71, and there are six under 30. Sarwar Ahmed, publisher of the list, said yesterday: \"We started this four years ago and it's fascinating to see the growth of Asian wealth in the UK . \"It's also interesting to note that there is a definite broadening of the industries that Asians are investing in, although the stronghold remains in food, fashion and retailing. However, we are seeing the community diversify into finance, media, pharmaceuticals and IT.\" The rich list 1 Lakshmi Mittal Ispat International \u00a32.2bn 2 Sri &amp; Gopi Hinduja Sangam \u00a31.95bn 3 Lord Paul Caparo \u00a3330m 4 Felix Grovit Chequepoint \u00a3300m 5 Jasminder Singh Edwardian hotels \u00a3260m 6 Dinesh Dhamija Flightbookers \u00a3210m 7 Vijay &amp; Bikhu Patel, Waymade Healthcare \u00a3203m 8 Anil Chandaria Comcraf \u00a3200m 9= Tom Singh New Look \u00a3175m 9= Manubhai Madhvani plantations/trade \u00a3175m 9= Tahir Mohsan Time computers \u00a3175m",

      "bodyText": "A Jehovah's Witness couple forbidden by their religion to receive blood transfusions were recovering in hospital yesterday after undergoing \"bloodless\" kidney transplant procedures. Marie Hoyle, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, donated a kidney to her husband, Alf, 51, after he had waited nine years for a donor organ. The operation was the first of its kind in Britain to involve Jehovah's Witnesses. The procedures, performed at St James's hospital, Leeds, on Friday, were said to be a success, with both patients expected to leave hospital within a week. The \"bloodless\" technique relies on a salt solution which increases blood volume during surgery to allow for small losses. Precision instruments are used to lessen the chance of severed arteries, and any blood spilled is cleaned and recycled. Bloodless surgery is a recognised alternative for Jehovah's Witnesses, who cite at least 400 biblical references prohibiting them from receiving blood. The couple, who have been married for 30 years and have two children, decided to undergo the surgery after Mr Hoyle had been on dialysis three times a week for nine years. He said: \"I can't express what a loving thing, what a tremendous thing my wife has done in giving me a kidney.\"",

Mark Hedley, 34, is to sue the German-owned Aldi chain after he was barred from returning to the Seaham store in County Durham. The manager, who had previously been praised as a good manager by his superiors, was told to stay away when he tried to go back after treatment. Mr Hedley, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, has launched a legal battle with the backing of disability campaigners. Evidence lodged by Aldi ahead of an employment tribunal due to start on April 10 showed it feared he would have a negative impact on business. Defending the ban, Aldi cited \"genuine and understandable concerns that if the applicant remained in situ sales at the store would suffer\". The company also claims some staff would be \"uncomfortable\" working with him when it put him on paid \"gardening leave\" last June. Mr Hedley is claiming direct discrimination against him because of his disability and, following last year's landmark European victory by gay service personnel booted out of the armed forces, sex discrimination. Mr Hedley, who worked for Aldi's for four years, disputes Aldi's claim that staff were unhappy about working with him. \"Aldi's used my shop as an example of how to run a store, how it looked and that,\" said Mr Hedley. \"The staff knew I was gay and I've spoken to most of them and they have no problem with me being HIV.\" Mr Hedley's solicitor, Stefan Cross, said: \"I'm shocked this conduct still exists in the 21st century.

London taxi drivers - that rare breed who can scoot down an obscure sideroad, perform a three-point turn on a postage stamp and recite the complete works of Richard Littlejohn all at the same time -are today revealed by scientists to have bigger brains.</p> <p>London researchers report today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a prestigious US journal, that they scanned the brains of 16 right-handed London cabbies and found that in all cases, the size of a region of the brain called the hippocampus was millimetres larger than in a comparable group of 50 ordinary right-handed men who did not drive taxis.</p> <p>The hippocampus is closely associated with spatial memory - where the brain keeps its maps. London taxi drivers, famous for knowing routes between thousands of places in the city, spend two years assembling a detailed map which they file away in the memory.</p> <p>\"The hippocampus is where we store the things we consciously remember,\" said Eleanor Maguire, of the institute of neurology at University College, London.</p> <p>\"As part of that, we would include navigation. We know in animals that navigation and the hippocampus are intimately linked.

      "bodyText": "They have The Knowledge by name, and the knowledge by nature. London taxi drivers - that rare breed who can scoot down an obscure sideroad, perform a three-point turn on a postage stamp and recite the complete works of Richard Littlejohn all at the same time -are today revealed by scientists to have bigger brains. London researchers report today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a prestigious US journal, that they scanned the brains of 16 right-handed London cabbies and found that in all cases, the size of a region of the brain called the hippocampus was millimetres larger than in a comparable group of 50 ordinary right-handed men who did not drive taxis. The hippocampus is closely associated with spatial memory - where the brain keeps its maps. London taxi drivers, famous for knowing routes between thousands of places in the city, spend two years assembling a detailed map which they file away in the memory. \"The hippocampus is where we store the things we consciously remember,\" said Eleanor Maguire, of the institute of neurology at University College, London. \"As part of that, we would include navigation. We know in animals that navigation and the hippocampus are intimately linked. So, it would seem now, is the human hippocampus.\" Tests with rats, squirrels and birds had shown that if the hippocampus is damaged, the creature can no longer find its way around. Ordinary mortals, too, have shown that they use the hippocampus to find their way around. But the brains of London taxi drivers grew to ac commodate the gazetteer of a whole city. The better they knew their way around, the bigger the hippocampus. \"They are an excellent group of people to study,\" Dr Maguire said. \"They have already acquired a vast amount of spatial information. It's the kind of study you can only do in this city, because taxi drivers elsewhere aren't licensed in the same way.\" The researchers had previously placed volunteer drivers in scanners, quizzed them on the best routes around London, and watched the brain fire up. This time, they simply invited them to lie back - silently - and have their grey matter measured by two different techniques. \"What we did was look at the amount of time spent as a taxi driver and then looked at a brain scan,\" said Dr Maguire. \"We found a significant correlation, in that the posterior of the back part of the hippocampus increased in size.

There are many \"short-hand\" characters - a few hastily portrayed details, slotted in sporadically to remind us what, rather than who, they are. PC Hollis - offi cious nerd. Sgt Cryer - tough but fair. DI Burnside - rule-breaker. But why did Hollis become a copper instead of, say, a maths teacher? What private grief made Burnside so irredeemably bad? We don't know, don't need to. Look at it from the writer's perspective. When you've got to show \"big stuff\" happening - a bank job or domestic slaying - and you've got to wrap it up in 30 minutes, you don't have time to tell the viewers where DC Glaze goes to get his Afro retouched. </p> <p>But devotees know this is half the story. In fact, some of The Bill's most popular episodes have delved deep into its characters' after-hours existences. What about the 1986 clash between Sgts Cryer and Penny? The impeccable Cryer was loitering with intent around Penny's wife. Or the episode in 1987, when WPC Ackland got pickled on duty following the death of her father. </p> <p>Such scarce moments are multiplying now the show has returned to the one-hour format. Recently we've seen PC Garfield lose his heart to an Irish nurse, and then turn his back, not just on Irish nurses, but on the Force itself when she plumped for PC Quinnan. We then saw Quinnan court and marry her; we even know what sort of duvet they've got. And our thoughts were very much with his wife when he vanished last week. For the first time we sympathised with an \"ordinary\" character. Our interest has been taken beyond the precinct, and into people's hearts. </p> <p>These developments are a deliberate measure. An hour is a weird time in telly terms - too short for a movie, too long for a soap. To keep momentum, without overloading on action, you need to lay bait for the viewers, spice it with human detail. DI Burnside informing some scrote that he's \"goin' daahn\" won't wash; you need to see how Quinnan's job affects his marriage.

      "bodyText": "In The Long View (9.0am, Radio 4) Jonathan Freedland launches a plea for justice for the Scottish body-snatchers Burke and Hare. Apparently they have been woefully traduced these past 180 years, never having robbed a grave in their lives. Edinburgh's anatomists were looking for fresh bodies, uncorrupted and free of the graveyard's unpleasantly sticky clay. So the lads carefully smothered their candidates at home and presented them to the surgeons as fresh as a daisy. Starting in showbiz as the Eichelbaum Family never had a convincing ring, which is why Michael Freedland opens his new series about The Men Who Made Hollywood (9.0pm, Radio 2) with the Warner Brothers. That's what the Polish cobbler's four little boys (including Jack, pictured) named themselves when they moved to Hollywood in 1917 to start a film company. Three years later, with times turning hard, they staked everything on an untried process called Vitaphone. It synchronised sound with moving pictures and made their fortune.",

      "trailText": "<p>Michael Foale is the British-born astronaut who saved the Mir space station. He tells  Julian Borger how he became an ambassador for Nasa - and why Britain will never be taken seriously in the space race</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Michael Foale was the first punk in space. The British-American astronaut, and the closest thing we have to the kind of guy who starred in the Right Stuff, was a Sex Pistols and Ramones fan. He met his wife, Rhonda, when she was playing in a punk band called the Kitty Projectiles. </p> <p>All that is behind him now. He listens to Depeche Mode these days. He is a 43-year-old father of two and one of Nasa's most senior and revered astronauts - a seemingly squeaky-clean hero in an orange space suit. </p> <p>Yet something remains of the rebellious days of his youth - an open dislike for the unimaginative ways of the British establishment and the Thatcherism which he believes still pervades Whitehall's corridors of power. Foale blames that culture and its refusal to contemplate a British astronaut programme for driving him across the Atlantic to the US and Nasa. </p> <p>The rest is space history. Foale was on the Mir space station in 1997 when the Russians accidentally sent an extra-terrestrial rubbish truck hurtling into its hull. Not long after that, he was sent tumbling helplessly through space when a Russian cosmonaut unplugged the wrong cable. </p> <p>Yet Foale kept his cool through the string of near disasters, for which he earned universal respect. He speaks excellent Russian, has kept in close touch with his cosmonaut chums, and is one of the few Nasa officials the Russian space people trust. </p> <p>\"The perfect diplomat\" is how Foale is described by his fellow astronaut, Jerry Linenger. It is not meant entirely as a compliment. Linenger, Foale's predecessor on Mir, has just brought out a tell-all book portraying himself as a gruff and fearless maverick, unafraid to speak out against the sloppiness of the Russian space programme and convinced that Nasa's $400m-a-year financial contribution was an extortionate rip-off. Foale comes out of the book, Off the Planet, looking like a conformist goody-goody. </p> <p>\"That is the big difference between me and Jerry,\" Foale says. \"Jerry saw himself as an ambassador of the US way of life, and of US supremacy in space. He decided his role was to tell the Russians how it should be done.\" </p> <p>Even Foale, the very embodiment of cultural sensitivity, acknowledges that safety precautions on board Mir were not all they could have been, and has likened his stay on board the orbiting Russian station to \"a very dirty and grimy camping trip in an old car\". But he says the experience was much more enjoyable and educational than it would have been had everything gone well. </p> <p>Foale is Nasa's leading astronaut-diplomat, responsible for negotiations with Russia and the west Europeans over the much delayed International Space Station now under construction outside Earth's atmosphere. It is a hugely ambitious vehicle which he hopes one day to command. </p> <p>In the course of a wide-ranging and meandering conversation on a Houston spring afternoon, he loses his sure footing only once, when the sticky subject of sex in space creeps up. \"I would never be unfaithful to my wife,\" he says, somewhat defensively. Heaven forbid, but what about cosmic sex in general? A French astronomer called Pierre Kohler has just stirred up some fuss and free publicity for his new book by claiming that US and Russian astronauts have already had extra-terrestrial sex, and that Nasa had even designed a contraption to prevent astronauts floating away from each other at the vital moment. He says Kohler is misinformed on his tales of steamy zero-gravity coupling. \"It hasn't happened. These organisations [Nasa and the Russian space programme] are so old-fashioned - this is taboo. It's not talked about,\" says Foale. </p> <p>Although Foale left Britain almost two decades ago (in 1983) and now carries a US passport, he is still British enough to feel embarrassed about his native country's lack of interest in sending people into space. For the past few years he has been unsuccessfully lobbying Whitehall for the money to put up a real British astronaut. He was involved in recent talks on the subject between Nasa and Downing Street and when he met Tony Blair, the prime minister seemed to be genuinely interested. But the idea was quashed as soon as it reached Blair's scientific advisers. </p> <p>\"In the civil service the feeling is that human space flight is for entertainment only. It is extraordinarily dismissive and incorrect, to put it bluntly,\" Foale says. </p> <p>Among the world's main industrialised countries, Britain is now almost alone in refusing to get involved in any astronaut programme. Only one truly British astronaut has been in space - Helen Sharman, in 1991 - but she was Soviet-funded, a shortlived product of glasnost. </p> <p>\"I think Britain has stopped thinking adventurously, officially,\" he says. \"When the civil service gets together and says: 'What are Britain's interests?', they narrow their horizon at the start of the conversation, by saying: 'We will not do anything that does not have a return within three or five years.' They don't have a 20-year plan. They have a three-year plan or a five-year plan.\" </p> <p>Foale's argument is that by thinking small, we are missing the point - that through the ages, exploration inspires and drags society along behind it. \"Going into space with human beings captivates and motivates children's imagination to such an extent that they go out and strive to achieve greater things.\" </p> <p>Rather than pay for it, Britain has counted on the vicarious thrills provided by other countries' astro nauts and cosmonauts, and there is clearly something to be said for that approach. It doesn't cost a penny, and it clearly worked for the young Foale, who made up his mind to be an astronaut after seeing John Glenn's Friendship 7 capsule at a space exhibition. His father was an RAF pilot, and so it seemed natural to follow in his footsteps. But some officious optician diagnosed an eyesight problem (wrongly, Foale says) and cut short that route to the stars. So Foale took the academic path, embarking on degrees in astrophysics and astronomy, and hoping he would pass muster with the European Space Agency (ESA). </p> <p>He reckoned without Margaret Thatcher, who made it clear that her government would not finance ventures with such an unquantifiable rate of return as manned space flight. As a result, would-be British astronauts did not have much of a chance of passing muster with the ESA selection committee. So Foale decided to \"activate\" his American half: his mother is an American citizen and had the foresight to register the infant Michael with the US embassy. </p> <p>There was another, tragic, reason for Foale's departure from Britain. In 1980, he was on holiday with his brother and his girlfriend, driving across what was then Yugoslavia on the way to Greece. Foale was at the wheel when a truck swerved across the road, killing both passengers. He survived but he was lost, amputated from his former life. Alongside his course-work, it was the company of a pair of Cambridge boozing buddies which helped to distract him - a couple of Falstaffian aesthetes making their way up the university comedy arts scene, Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, who larked around in a drinking club called the Cherubs. </p> <p>\"I was the oldest of the Cherubs,\" he recalls. \"I was trying to be busy, active to regain my own interests in life. They helped me a lot through my own emotional hard times and my recovery and they were very sensitive to me, and I'm grateful.\" </p> <p>There is a certain unmistakeable Englishness about the hero of Mir. He attributes his ability to stay cool in the isolation of space only half-jokingly to his years at public school. \"There were no girls there [at King's School, Canterbury] and no girls on the Mir. The food on the Mir was better, the freedoms on the Mir were less, the sports activity about the same. And the education about the same.\" </p> <p>On June 25 1997, Foale was the Nasa guest astronaut on board Mir with cosmonauts Vasily Tsibliev and Sasha Lazutkin. Energia, the Russian corporation running Mir, announced that the crew would have to attempt a docking with a supply ship call Progress which had been orbiting earth filled with junk removed earlier from Mir. </p> <p>There was no real reason for the docking, but Energia did not want to continue paying the Ukrainians for an automatic coupling system, and insisted the Mir crew practise a manual method. It had been tested just once before, with near-disastrous results. Yet the ground controllers insisted it be tried again. </p> <p>This time, with Tsibliev at the controls, it hit a solar panel and then crashed into the Spektr module, Foale's sleeping quarters. At the time he was in the far end of the space station. He said he recalled a \"bad thud\", and hung weightless, waiting for the air to be sucked out of his lungs. That did not happen, but he could feel the pressure drop. \"It was just like when you're in a lift going up in a building and that was the sure sign that we definitely had a problem that the air was leaking out,\" he says. </p> <p>Mir was saved only because Lazutkin ignored the emergency drill and refused to abandon ship. Instead, he and Foale managed to close the hatch on the Spektr module and isolate the leak. </p> <p>Days later, it was Foale's turn to save the ship. When one of the cosmonauts mistakenly uncoupled Mir's main computer, the station began cartwheeling, throwing its solar panels out of alignment with the sun, threatening to trigger a catastrophic loss of power. </p> <p>An attempt to escape might have been lethal, as the Soyuz pod most likely would have collided with Mir's spinning arms. Instead, Foale took the controls of the Soyuz and improvised, using the escape pod's thrusters to nudge the whole station back into its proper orbit. </p> <p>By surviving, Foale has doubtless used up a good portion of his luck quota, but he is already planning his next trip for when the International Space Station is ready to receive astronauts later this year. \"I'm still willing to take risks,\" he explains. \"In fact, the more things I seem to dodge, the more I think: OK, act carefully, but keep living.\"</p>",

They helped me a lot through my own emotional hard times and my recovery and they were very sensitive to me, and I'm grateful.\" There is a certain unmistakeable Englishness about the hero of Mir. He attributes his ability to stay cool in the isolation of space only half-jokingly to his years at public school. \"There were no girls there [at King's School, Canterbury] and no girls on the Mir. The food on the Mir was better, the freedoms on the Mir were less, the sports activity about the same. And the education about the same.\" On June 25 1997, Foale was the Nasa guest astronaut on board Mir with cosmonauts Vasily Tsibliev and Sasha Lazutkin. Energia, the Russian corporation running Mir, announced that the crew would have to attempt a docking with a supply ship call Progress which had been orbiting earth filled with junk removed earlier from Mir. There was no real reason for the docking, but Energia did not want to continue paying the Ukrainians for an automatic coupling system, and insisted the Mir crew practise a manual method. It had been tested just once before, with near-disastrous results. Yet the ground controllers insisted it be tried again. This time, with Tsibliev at the controls, it hit a solar panel and then crashed into the Spektr module, Foale's sleeping quarters. At the time he was in the far end of the space station. He said he recalled a \"bad thud\", and hung weightless, waiting for the air to be sucked out of his lungs. That did not happen, but he could feel the pressure drop. \"It was just like when you're in a lift going up in a building and that was the sure sign that we definitely had a problem that the air was leaking out,\" he says. Mir was saved only because Lazutkin ignored the emergency drill and refused to abandon ship. Instead, he and Foale managed to close the hatch on the Spektr module and isolate the leak. Days later, it was Foale's turn to save the ship. When one of the cosmonauts mistakenly uncoupled Mir's main computer, the station began cartwheeling, throwing its solar panels out of alignment with the sun, threatening to trigger a catastrophic loss of power. An attempt to escape might have been lethal, as the Soyuz pod most likely would have collided with Mir's spinning arms. Instead, Foale took the controls of the Soyuz and improvised, using the escape pod's thrusters to nudge the whole station back into its proper orbit. By surviving, Foale has doubtless used up a good portion of his luck quota, but he is already planning his next trip for when the International Space Station is ready to receive astronauts later this year. \"I'm still willing to take risks,\" he explains. \"In fact, the more things I seem to dodge, the more I think: OK, act carefully, but keep living.\"",

Last night Geoff Dobson, chairman of the Association of Chief Officers of Probation, said: \"It is a good decision. Our fear was that a new name would reduce, rather than increase, public awareness of the service and confuse people. We can now concentrate on the very important changes to the way the service is run.\"",

At this time he made some of his most impressive work, mostly powerful slab-built pots inspired by middle eastern architecture.

Mr Cohen said he had held \"cordial and warm talks\" with the Vietnamese defence minister, General Pham Van Tra, on developing modest military ties. He stressed that both countries wanted to move carefully, and that joint efforts to account for the 2,000 US service personnel still listed as missing in action from the war would remain central. As he spoke, scores of Vietnamese women shifted mud from the paddy field crash site as they searched for plane fragments and other remains. Asked if he had encountered problems in his talks because of the war, in which South Vietnam, backed by the US, fell to the communist north in 1975, Mr Cohen said: \"I did not detect any psychological baggage.\" He added: \"That we don't overestimate what can be established in a short period of time, that we take it step by step and engage in mutual confidence building measures - that will be the best way to achieve a much broader relationship with Vietnam.\" Mr Cohen is the first US defence secretary to visit Vietnam since the end of the conflict, which killed about 58,000 US soldiers and an estimated 3m Vietnamese troops and civilians. He repeatedly praised Hanoi for its increasing cooperation in helping resolve the issue of US troops missing in action. Mr Cohen said that he and Mr Tra had discussed military medicine, de-mining and chemical dioxins that the US sprayed during the conflict. Vietnam's vice-president, Nguyen Thi Binh, has said about 1m Vietnamese were victims of the dioxin Agent Orange, out of a population of 79m. But Mr Cohen said at the weekend that the US would not make any apologies for the Vietnam war. Reuters",

The tribunal has long insisted that Zagreb hand over documents relating to operations Flash and Storm, in which Serbs were driven out of the Krajina region of Croatia in 1995.</p> <p>\"They have started a process of handing over documents. I am very pleased that I've been able to witness what is, in all senses, a Zagreb spring,\" Mr Cook said yesterday before talks in Zagreb with President Stipe Mesic, Mr Tudjman's successor.</p> <p>The tribunal believes that the documents may contain information which could lead to indictments for war crimes. British officials in Zagreb said there was a long way to go before all the requested papers were handed over.</p> <p>Croatia has been angered by the recent 45-year sentence passed on a Bosnian Croat general, Tihomir Blaskic, for his part in the ethnic cleansing of Muslims during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. Blaskic's sentence was the heaviest handed down by the tribunal so far and has retarded moves to extradite one indicted suspect, the Bosnian Croat warlord Mladen \"Tuta\" Naletilic.</p> <p>Mr Cook said last night that the trial of the former Bosnian Serb general Radislav Krstic, which opened at the Hague yesterday, showed that \"ethnic identity was not a factor in the tribunal's pursuit of justice\".</p> <p>The foreign secretary also praised Croatia's new centre-left coalition government for promising to negotiate the return of Serb refugees expelled during the Bosnian war.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, yesterday urged the new Croatian government to hand over evidence of war crimes to the international tribunal at the Hague. Croatia's lack of cooperation with the tribunal poisoned the country's relations with western Europe during the regime of president Franjo Tudjman, who died last December. The tribunal has long insisted that Zagreb hand over documents relating to operations Flash and Storm, in which Serbs were driven out of the Krajina region of Croatia in 1995. \"They have started a process of handing over documents. I am very pleased that I've been able to witness what is, in all senses, a Zagreb spring,\" Mr Cook said yesterday before talks in Zagreb with President Stipe Mesic, Mr Tudjman's successor. The tribunal believes that the documents may contain information which could lead to indictments for war crimes. British officials in Zagreb said there was a long way to go before all the requested papers were handed over. Croatia has been angered by the recent 45-year sentence passed on a Bosnian Croat general, Tihomir Blaskic, for his part in the ethnic cleansing of Muslims during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. Blaskic's sentence was the heaviest handed down by the tribunal so far and has retarded moves to extradite one indicted suspect, the Bosnian Croat warlord Mladen \"Tuta\" Naletilic. Mr Cook said last night that the trial of the former Bosnian Serb general Radislav Krstic, which opened at the Hague yesterday, showed that \"ethnic identity was not a factor in the tribunal's pursuit of justice\". The foreign secretary also praised Croatia's new centre-left coalition government for promising to negotiate the return of Serb refugees expelled during the Bosnian war.",

Forbidding pubs, arcades and a sad, greying Woolworth's spill out on to a pedestrianised market square. Groups of cheaply fashionable teenagers slouch around in their single-sex groups, flirting aggressively from opposite sides of the road.</p> <p>Madigan's life was troubled almost from the start. His mother was killed in a car crash when he was just six weeks old. His father - an alcoholic, according to the council - suddenly left in sole charge of four children, was unable to cope. \"It is suggested,\" the profile compiled by the council reads simply, \"that he felt lost without his wife.\"</p> <p>Things went downhill from there, it seems. By the age of eight Decland was no longer going to school. The council says he stopped attending, and that he defied several attempts to get him back into education. But Andrew Siddall, the boy's solicitor, says his father withdrew the boy briefly from school because he was being teased about his Irish name, and was unable to find another school willing to take him.</p> <p>\"He was quite keen to go to a local comprehensive,\" he says, \"but he was only allowed to attend in the mornings. He was sent home before lunch, and so he wasn't able to mix with the other kids and make friends.\"</p> <p>For a while, Madigan went to a special school, his reading and writing having fallen well behind. But he was frustrated by being taught alongside children with special needs, and stopped attending as soon as his friends found out he was going there. An experiment with a home tutor proved successful for a while, but the relationship soon broke down. \"No matter what slant the education authority put on it, he was not taken back into school, and he was not provided with adequate educational facilities,\" says Siddall.</p> <p>Madigan's \"antisocial behaviour\" began almost as soon as he left school. First it was riding his push bike on the pavements and forcing pedestrians out of the way. Then he progressed to motorbikes, which he had to steal. Then cars.</p> <p>As he became increasingly well known in the area, says Jeff Whitmore, an inspector with the local police, he would attract groups of youths eager to be seen with him. Even the older kids, the 17- and 18-year olds, do what he says.</p> <p>\"There is something about Decland,\" says Whitmore, a genial, square-jawed man, with a direct gaze and a brow that crinkles when he talk about Madigan. \"He has a very, very strong character. It's incredible, really, that this 14-year-old youth can have this effect.\"</p> <p>The extent of the Madigan effect is clear from the boy's neighbours on the Crabtree Farm estate above the town. It's a bleak and strangely empty place, despite the thousands who live there.</p> <p>One man's eyes cloud with genuine anxiety when Madigan's name is mentioned. \"We are just so afraid of reprisals,\" he mutters, anxious that the playing children nearby won't hear. Specifying carefully what exactly can and cannot be said to identify him, he tells of vicious retribution \"within an hour of him giving the order\" on one occasion when he spoke out against the boy. Some of the stories he tells of the problems shopkeepers and neighbours have stretch one's credulity. But like Whitmore, there is a trace of almost pastoral warmth in his voice, too. \"Police heavyhandedness in throwing him into prison will be no good for this boy. He doesn't need to put in prison, he needs a minder - he's never had that.\"</p> <p>Siddall claims Madigan has become a whipping boy for youth crime in Nottingham. \"Possibly he was an easy target, because he was relatively young. Because the system didn't allow for him to be locked up, he became a persistent offender. He became an easy target for politicians to say, 'Look, this lad has committed x numbers of offences in the last few weeks, and yet he is still walking free.'\"</p> <p>He points to the fact that the council leader, Graham Chapman, the council's anti-social behaviour team and inspector Whitmore all attended at court yesterday, waiting several hours for the hearing. As soon as the sentence was announced, Chapman convened a press conference in the waiting area of the youth court. \"This is a 14-year-old lad who is no worse than many who have appeared in the youth courts,\" says Siddall. \"I don't think for a minute he could understand why all these people had taken an interest in him, why people wanted to put him on television, why people wanted to report about his case.\"</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Nigel Wrench is used to taking risks. Before an awards ceremony where his radio show was up for a gong, he decided to use the acceptance speech to reveal he was HIV-positive. Given that the programme was up against two rivals, there was only a one-in-three chance that his BBC bosses would find out. They did.</p> <p>Wrench, now the presenter of Radio 4's teatime news programme PM, has just made another confession: this time in the gay press. Taking a chance that no one outside the Pink Paper's readership circle would notice, he wrote: \"Since I've been HIV-positive, I've had 'unsafe' sex more times than I can remember, often with men whose names I could not tell you now.\"</p> <p>Even to many gay men, it is a startling admission. For the safe sex message, like the early anti-drugs campaigns, has been unequivocal. Use condoms or you'll get Aids and die horribly. Even more important, if you have Aids, use a condom always - even if you know your partner is positive too.</p> <p>But, as the \"just say no\" brigade discovered, telling people not to do something usually has the opposite effect. As with drug use, unprotected sex among gay men, particularly among those who are HIV-positive, is on the increase almost to the point of normality. It's so normal that personal advertisers and internet chatroom users have come up with a name for it. It's called barebacking.</p> <p>Until now, it's a practice that has been confined to the anonymous locations of internet chatrooms, personal ads, cruising areas and London's underground sex-club scene. But Wrench's admission, although he is at pains to stress that he only has unprotected sex with other men who are also HIV positive, will shock even the most tolerant of Hampstead liberals. And it is a confession which is dangerous for the journalist himself, given his high-profile role as one of the presenters of Radio 4's prime-time afternoon news show, PM.</p> <p>The article in the Pink Paper - where Wrench, 39, is a regular columnist on HIV and Aids issues - was framed in candid terms. \"The first guy I ever fucked without a condom gave me HIV,\" he opened. \"What's more, that night on Hampstead Heath, he wanted me to fuck him without a condom.\" He went on: \"I am not part of some Aids army out to recruit everyone who comes anywhere near. I simply seek to point out that there is a rational debate to be had.\" And he concluded: \"Barebacking can be warm, exciting and involving. We need to debate it. But don't let's start by writing it off as irresponsible and stupid. That, frankly, is both absurd and dangerous.\"</p> <p>Wrench became HIV-positive in 1993 and now has full-blown Aids which is under control thanks to a combination of drugs. Clearly, he is determined to be heard. His message is simple: knee-jerk condemnation of men who have unprotected anal sex by choice is pointless.</p> <p>Among sexual health professionals, it is a view which has gained currency. For a year or two now, groups involved in health promotion have been steering away from the stark \"always use a condom\" message towards encouraging men to make an informed choice. An authoritative survey of 10,000 gay men by the Terrence Higgins Trust showed that one in three had unprotected anal sex at least once in the previous year.</p> <p>When the Guardian published an article in 1991 describing the prevalence of unprotected sex among gay men in London clubs, protesters picketed the newspaper's offices. Now, such is the change in climate that it is hard to find many informed commentators who will disagree very much with what Wrench says.</p> <p>Still, among many ordinary gay men, the reaction is one of horror, as a glance at the letters pages of the gay press will testify. Before Wrench wrote his piece, the editor of the gay listings magazine Boyz, David Hudson, penned an editorial in response to the internet barebacking phenomenon, where at the extreme you can find personal ads for men who want to become HIV positive, and dates for \"sero-conversion parties\". This is dancing right at the precipice of sexual edge-play - and is a practice which Wrench does not seek to defend or support - but it is certainly going on. To what extent, no one really knows.</p> <p>While those who defend the practice claim it is the \"ultimate expression of intimacy\", Hudson brands its practitioners simply selfish. \"I thought if you cared about someone, you'd want to do your best to protect them, not put their lives at risk - or your own. I hate to be the reminder of depressing news, but although there have been great advances in drug treatments, there is still no cure for Aids and there is no drug that can totally eliminate HIV from the body.\"</p> <p>Whether deliberately or not, men are having unprotected sex with men, every night of the week. Many of these encounters are between men who know they are HIV-positive. Some, inevitably, are not. As the opportunities for wild, anonymous sex increase, the risk of more men becoming infected with HIV is increasing too.</p> <p>Few outside the gay circle probably know it, but there are now around a dozen clubs in London where sex on the premises is actively encouraged, as well as numerous \"saunas\" and \"steam rooms\". The London Apprentice has closed since the Guardian made it the focus of the piece in 1991, but scan the pages of the gay listings weeklies and the phenomenon is there for the initiated to see. The description \"cruisy atmosphere\" is usually the giveaway. That means that there is an area of the club, maybe a separate room, where you can have sex with anyone who takes your fancy. It's steamy, sweaty, and the clubs can't pack them in tighter.

      "bodyText": "Nigel Wrench is used to taking risks. Before an awards ceremony where his radio show was up for a gong, he decided to use the acceptance speech to reveal he was HIV-positive. Given that the programme was up against two rivals, there was only a one-in-three chance that his BBC bosses would find out. They did. Wrench, now the presenter of Radio 4's teatime news programme PM, has just made another confession: this time in the gay press. Taking a chance that no one outside the Pink Paper's readership circle would notice, he wrote: \"Since I've been HIV-positive, I've had 'unsafe' sex more times than I can remember, often with men whose names I could not tell you now.\" Even to many gay men, it is a startling admission. For the safe sex message, like the early anti-drugs campaigns, has been unequivocal. Use condoms or you'll get Aids and die horribly. Even more important, if you have Aids, use a condom always - even if you know your partner is positive too. But, as the \"just say no\" brigade discovered, telling people not to do something usually has the opposite effect. As with drug use, unprotected sex among gay men, particularly among those who are HIV-positive, is on the increase almost to the point of normality. It's so normal that personal advertisers and internet chatroom users have come up with a name for it. It's called barebacking. Until now, it's a practice that has been confined to the anonymous locations of internet chatrooms, personal ads, cruising areas and London's underground sex-club scene. But Wrench's admission, although he is at pains to stress that he only has unprotected sex with other men who are also HIV positive, will shock even the most tolerant of Hampstead liberals. And it is a confession which is dangerous for the journalist himself, given his high-profile role as one of the presenters of Radio 4's prime-time afternoon news show, PM. The article in the Pink Paper - where Wrench, 39, is a regular columnist on HIV and Aids issues - was framed in candid terms. \"The first guy I ever fucked without a condom gave me HIV,\" he opened. \"What's more, that night on Hampstead Heath, he wanted me to fuck him without a condom.\" He went on: \"I am not part of some Aids army out to recruit everyone who comes anywhere near. I simply seek to point out that there is a rational debate to be had.\" And he concluded: \"Barebacking can be warm, exciting and involving. We need to debate it. But don't let's start by writing it off as irresponsible and stupid. That, frankly, is both absurd and dangerous.\" Wrench became HIV-positive in 1993 and now has full-blown Aids which is under control thanks to a combination of drugs. Clearly, he is determined to be heard. His message is simple: knee-jerk condemnation of men who have unprotected anal sex by choice is pointless. Among sexual health professionals, it is a view which has gained currency. For a year or two now, groups involved in health promotion have been steering away from the stark \"always use a condom\" message towards encouraging men to make an informed choice. An authoritative survey of 10,000 gay men by the Terrence Higgins Trust showed that one in three had unprotected anal sex at least once in the previous year. When the Guardian published an article in 1991 describing the prevalence of unprotected sex among gay men in London clubs, protesters picketed the newspaper's offices. Now, such is the change in climate that it is hard to find many informed commentators who will disagree very much with what Wrench says. Still, among many ordinary gay men, the reaction is one of horror, as a glance at the letters pages of the gay press will testify. Before Wrench wrote his piece, the editor of the gay listings magazine Boyz, David Hudson, penned an editorial in response to the internet barebacking phenomenon, where at the extreme you can find personal ads for men who want to become HIV positive, and dates for \"sero-conversion parties\". This is dancing right at the precipice of sexual edge-play - and is a practice which Wrench does not seek to defend or support - but it is certainly going on. To what extent, no one really knows. While those who defend the practice claim it is the \"ultimate expression of intimacy\", Hudson brands its practitioners simply selfish. \"I thought if you cared about someone, you'd want to do your best to protect them, not put their lives at risk - or your own. I hate to be the reminder of depressing news, but although there have been great advances in drug treatments, there is still no cure for Aids and there is no drug that can totally eliminate HIV from the body.\" Whether deliberately or not, men are having unprotected sex with men, every night of the week. Many of these encounters are between men who know they are HIV-positive. Some, inevitably, are not. As the opportunities for wild, anonymous sex increase, the risk of more men becoming infected with HIV is increasing too. Few outside the gay circle probably know it, but there are now around a dozen clubs in London where sex on the premises is actively encouraged, as well as numerous \"saunas\" and \"steam rooms\". The London Apprentice has closed since the Guardian made it the focus of the piece in 1991, but scan the pages of the gay listings weeklies and the phenomenon is there for the initiated to see. The description \"cruisy atmosphere\" is usually the giveaway. That means that there is an area of the club, maybe a separate room, where you can have sex with anyone who takes your fancy. It's steamy, sweaty, and the clubs can't pack them in tighter. If nothing else, sex in a \"backroom\" is a far more inviting prospect than a shivery fumble on Hampstead Heath. The practice is probably illegal, but the law doesn't get involved. The crimes committed are classed as \"victimless\", and the police have taken the decision that there are better ways for them to be spending their money. So the ball is firmly in the court of the \"gay community\", whatever that is. Almost a decade after those protests at the Guardian's offices, Wrench says that it is time to acknowledge reality. \"Lots of people are barebacking. We do need to talk about it and we do need to say these are the choices we're making in having unprotected sex, and we are aware of these choices, so as to make those choices more informed.\" Hence the provocative language of his Pink Paper article. \"I think that having unprotected sex is something that people just don't talk about, even in the gay community where you can talk about everything.

The company has been holding talks with the Welsh Development Agency about the state-of-the-art Newport facility as part of a worldwide search for opportunities to increase its fabrication capacity. Intel employs around 3,000 people at two plants near Dublin but has no other European manufacturing operations.

The only African leader who regularly raises the issue and calls for a change in sexual habits is President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, where dire rates of infection have improved as a result. Of the world's 36m Aids sufferers, 23m live in sub-Saharan Africa. \"None of us has yet begun to grasp the full impact of this horror - on the quality of life in Africa, its economic potential and its social and political stability,\" Mr Annan said. He cited Ivory Coast, where a teacher dies of Aids every schoolday, and of Botswana, where a child born today has a life expectancy of 41 years whereas, without Aids, they would have been expected to live to 70.

Consumer spending, which accounts for 60% of GDP, fell by 1.6%. Government outlays on public works projects which have been used to fill the gaps in the economy also dried up. Housing investment fell 5.8% and exports declined relative to imports. </p> <p>But government ministers said a sharp 4.6% increase in corporate investment - the first rise in nine months - showed that confidence had returned in the private sector. </p> <p>\"I don't think we should worry too much\", finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters. \"On the contrary, I'm pleased that capital investment showed some improvement.\" </p> <p>Although a general election is looming, analysts said that this rosy outlook is not just political spin. </p> <p>\"There have been strong signs this year of a private sector-led recovery,\" said Kiichi Murashima of the Nomura Research Institute. \"But the foundation for recovery remains shaky.\" </p> <p>As well as a pick-up since January in industrial production, job offers, overtime hours and machinery orders, a new government spending package worth \u00a56.5 trillion (\u00a337bn) will kick in from April. </p> <p>Many large companies have also increased their profitability through restructuring, while other weaker firms have merged with stronger partners. In the latest shift in the financial sector, Sanwa Bank, Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank confirmed they are in talks to form the world's third largest banking alliance which would have combined assets of more than \u00a5100 trillion (\u00a3571bn). </p> <p>To achieve sustained growth, however, the government is looking to hitch on to the internet bandwagon by making the most of the country's lead in mobile communications technology. </p> <p>\"Although GDP was negative for two consecutive quarters, I do not consider this a recession,\" said Taichi Sakaiya, economic planning minister. \"New areas of growth, such as in information technology, will pull the economy forward.\" </p> <p>Yesterday, however, new technology companies dragged the Nikkei index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange back by 560 points as investors expressed increasing doubt about the valuations of internet-related equities. </p> <p>In little more than a month, the share prices of Japan's two biggest e-companies - Softbank and Hikari Tsushin - have lost more than 45% of their value.</p>",

But government ministers said a sharp 4.6% increase in corporate investment - the first rise in nine months - showed that confidence had returned in the private sector. \"I don't think we should worry too much\", finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters. \"On the contrary, I'm pleased that capital investment showed some improvement.\" Although a general election is looming, analysts said that this rosy outlook is not just political spin. \"There have been strong signs this year of a private sector-led recovery,\" said Kiichi Murashima of the Nomura Research Institute. \"But the foundation for recovery remains shaky.\" As well as a pick-up since January in industrial production, job offers, overtime hours and machinery orders, a new government spending package worth \u00a56.5 trillion (\u00a337bn) will kick in from April. Many large companies have also increased their profitability through restructuring, while other weaker firms have merged with stronger partners. In the latest shift in the financial sector, Sanwa Bank, Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank confirmed they are in talks to form the world's third largest banking alliance which would have combined assets of more than \u00a5100 trillion (\u00a3571bn). To achieve sustained growth, however, the government is looking to hitch on to the internet bandwagon by making the most of the country's lead in mobile communications technology. \"Although GDP was negative for two consecutive quarters, I do not consider this a recession,\" said Taichi Sakaiya, economic planning minister. \"New areas of growth, such as in information technology, will pull the economy forward.\" Yesterday, however, new technology companies dragged the Nikkei index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange back by 560 points as investors expressed increasing doubt about the valuations of internet-related equities. In little more than a month, the share prices of Japan's two biggest e-companies - Softbank and Hikari Tsushin - have lost more than 45% of their value.",

      "body": "<p>John Ruskin stands beside a foaming stream, somewhere in Scotland. With his high collar and city shoes, which are not quite planted on the rugged stone beneath his feet, he has the appearance of a man pasted on to the landscape. Which indeed he is: the painter, Sir John Everett Millais, accompanied the critic and his wife, Effie Gray, to Scotland in 1853, and spent months painting the rocks and the gushing water. He painted the lichen, the texture of the rocks, the bubbles drifting on the water; but he only roughed-in the space in the painting reserved for his full-length portrait of the great man. He had Ruskin pose for him in London the following year. Betweentimes, Millais and Ruskin's wife fell in love. Ruskin's marriage was annulled in July of 1854, on the grounds that it had never been consummated. </p> <p>It is hard not to see the painting as emblematic of Ruskin's own displacement, the awkwardness of the painting an echo of the awkwardness of the relationship between painter and subject. It is also, inadvertently, a painting of the critic somehow a little less real than the rocks themselves. It is a portrait, then, of a man who is not quite there. </p> <p>Millais's painting is the first exhibit in the huge exhibition Ruskin, Turner and the Pre-Raphaelites at the Tate Gallery. It is a kind of keynote, opening show for the relaunch of the gallery as Tate Britain this month. The show's curator, Robert Hewison, has been doing the rounds promoting Ruskin and making claims for the Pre-Raphaelite painters as the avant-garde Young British Artists of their day. </p> <p>But this re-reading of Ruskin and his circle feels somehow facile, even if the Pre-Raphaelite painters - Millais, Holman Hunt, Burne-Jones, Rossetti and the rest - were indeed the hot young artists of their day, thanks to Ruskin. Hewison, one of Ruskin's successors as Slade professor of fine art at Oxford, knows how to turn a trick, and the exhibition itself has been designed to blow our socks off, if not quite blow away a conception of Ruskin as a stuffy, mixed-up Victorian. </p> <p>Patriarchal and patronising as much as he was perceptive and passionate, Ruskin sticks in my craw, no matter the difficulties in his life that lend him sympathy as an essentially tragic figure who aspired to do good. Reeling out at the end of the show, my own feet were a little off the ground. I felt, too, a little ashamed of my profession - if what the critic does, like Ruskin, is to champion a coterie, to be blind to half the world of art, to hector and rant and dictate to artists as well as to the world. Learning, in John Batchelor's biography of the critic, that Ruskin's lec tures at Oxford degenerated into farce, with the great critic reduced to flapping his gown as he squawked around the stage imitating a bird, leaves me fearful of the critic's fate. </p> <p>The Tate's rooms change from charcoal-black rooms to oxblood walls, from purple to a kind of ecclesiastic maroon, as we move through Ruskin's life, following his activities as a collector and champion of artists and as an artist. Dramatic lighting, rooms filled with light and rooms lowering in blackness dramatise the works they contain and create an atmospheric backdrop to what is really an analysis of the critic's inner life. </p> <p>Here is Ruskin as a blond tot, painted by James Northcote in a Joshua Reynolds landscape. Here are the lad's parents, the sherry importer and the evangelical, strict mother, who groomed the boy for the pulpit. Here's the hellish nightmare of Turner's Slavers Throwing Overboard the Dead and Dying, with its lurid sky, the wild sea and chained bodies drowning in the waves. Turner could never paint people, or sea monsters, yet Ruskin felt for many years that this painting - which his father bought for him - represented the epitome of Turner's genius. </p> <p>How is it that Ruskin could idolise Turner so much, yet go on to claim that Holman Hunt's Light of the World was one of the \"noblest works of sacred art ever produced\"? How could he be revolted by Mantegna's dead Christ, yet swoon over Burne-Jones's The Golden Stairs, with its daft parade of Grecian girls in nighties? The undercurrents of Ruskin's life, his inner turbulence, his repression and his late madness are inevitably as much a theme as the paradoxes of his taste and his enthusiasms, the indigestability of all that regurgitated learning. Ruskin himself listed all the topics on which he had had to become familiar in order to write his magnum opus, Modern Painters: \"On German Metaphysics, on Poetry, Political Economy, Cookery, Music, Geology, Dress, Agriculture, Horticulture and Navigation... all of which I have had to 'read-up'.\" This list represents but a small corner of Ruskin's learning, the endless work that blighted him as much as it buffered him from his troubles. </p> <p>The American critic Rosalind Krauss asked, \"Is it possible, I imagine someone asking, to think of Ruskin - who could never produce a thought about art that was not at the same time a sermon - in the same universe as modernism?\" It is easy to laugh at him, she wrote. What Krauss rescued in her 1993 book The Optical Unconscious is Ruskin on a beach, mesmerised by the sea, child Ruskin fascinated by the pattern on a carpet, the whorls of wood-grain, Ruskin the \"infant fetishist of patchwork\". Little wonder that he had an abiding fascination for complex pattern and plenitude, for the strata of rocks, the sheen of bird's wings, for mountainscapes and cloud formations, for pebbles and for leaves. The natural world reared up at him, and in it, he saw the hand of God. And in man's works too - in Italian Gothic architecture, in the paintings of Tintoretto, in Verrocchio, in Turner and in the Pre-Raphaelites. He also came to the conclusion, late on, that the painter needs to be a little bit wicked, and worldly, to achieve anything. </p> <p>A good part of the project to rehabilitate Ruskin is to reclaim him through the understanding of his complexity, through sympathy for his upbringing, and through the breadth of his influence. It involves embracing, too, Ruskin the sexual failure, the evangelical moralist and anti-catholic, the man who hero- worshipped Turner and hated Whistler. But must we embrace mad old Ruskin with his infantilist baby-talk and obsession for little girls? </p> <p>What an unsympathetic creature he was, what a great subject for biography he is, what a movie he would make. He shaped his time as much as he was shaped by it. How much his moral certainties and their unravelling contributed to his madness, and how much madness there always was in him is unclear. His recent biographers - Batchelor and Tim Hilton (the concluding, second volume of whose monumental Life of Ruskin is newly published, 15 years after the first) - have to cope with the escalation of Ruskin's insanity, and with the fact that, as much as Ruskin idolised art and artists as both critic and collector, his greatest idolisation was reserved for himself. </p> <p>There is as much that is laughable, pompous, ridiculous and awful about these works as there is that is astonishing. The show includes the paintings by Whistler that led to the ridiculous 1878 libel trial - in which Whistler won a farthing's damages from Ruskin - and a couple of the remaining erotic sketches by Turner that escaped Ruskin's censorship and destruction. We also have here a large selection of Ruskin's own drawings and watercolours, which as much as they chart his looming decline, show that at least he had a practical sense of how art is made and what it might achieve. </p> <p>With each room painted a different colour, and with quotes (shortened into snappy epigrams, as though Ruskin was a High Victorian master of spin and soundbite) emblazoned high on the walls, the exhibition turns Ruskin's century, and Ruskin himself, into a kind of postmodern spectacle. It is not a pretty sight.</p>",

The natural world reared up at him, and in it, he saw the hand of God. And in man's works too - in Italian Gothic architecture, in the paintings of Tintoretto, in Verrocchio, in Turner and in the Pre-Raphaelites. He also came to the conclusion, late on, that the painter needs to be a little bit wicked, and worldly, to achieve anything. A good part of the project to rehabilitate Ruskin is to reclaim him through the understanding of his complexity, through sympathy for his upbringing, and through the breadth of his influence. It involves embracing, too, Ruskin the sexual failure, the evangelical moralist and anti-catholic, the man who hero- worshipped Turner and hated Whistler. But must we embrace mad old Ruskin with his infantilist baby-talk and obsession for little girls? What an unsympathetic creature he was, what a great subject for biography he is, what a movie he would make. He shaped his time as much as he was shaped by it. How much his moral certainties and their unravelling contributed to his madness, and how much madness there always was in him is unclear. His recent biographers - Batchelor and Tim Hilton (the concluding, second volume of whose monumental Life of Ruskin is newly published, 15 years after the first) - have to cope with the escalation of Ruskin's insanity, and with the fact that, as much as Ruskin idolised art and artists as both critic and collector, his greatest idolisation was reserved for himself. There is as much that is laughable, pompous, ridiculous and awful about these works as there is that is astonishing. The show includes the paintings by Whistler that led to the ridiculous 1878 libel trial - in which Whistler won a farthing's damages from Ruskin - and a couple of the remaining erotic sketches by Turner that escaped Ruskin's censorship and destruction. We also have here a large selection of Ruskin's own drawings and watercolours, which as much as they chart his looming decline, show that at least he had a practical sense of how art is made and what it might achieve. With each room painted a different colour, and with quotes (shortened into snappy epigrams, as though Ruskin was a High Victorian master of spin and soundbite) emblazoned high on the walls, the exhibition turns Ruskin's century, and Ruskin himself, into a kind of postmodern spectacle. It is not a pretty sight.",

But surely the idea that in some way recordings are a faithful replica of live performances went out with black vinyl; producers and engineers \"cheat\" all the time, not just in the obvious way of editing different takes together, but often by abandoning all pretence that a particular recording was made in a studio on one specific occasion. Placido Domingo recently recorded the tenor role in Mahler's Das Lied von Erde, but his songs were recorded months apart from the baritone numbers which are interleaved with them on the disc.

He doesn't see music as mere entertainment, more as something that grows organically out of the land, which is why putting him and his band in a formal concert hall is always going to feel somewhat stilted. In his Malian French, he explained that he didn't plan to come back to London, and would be handing on the baton to his long-time music pupil and guitar player Afel Boucoum, who played the evening's opening set. </p> <p>Still, having dragged himself onstage and plugged in his guitar, Ali at least seemed to be enjoying himself. He'd frequently let out a bark of laughter as he unleashed some particularly fiendish foray up the fretboard, while the call and response interplay between Ali and his backing vocalists swayed back and forth like a cobra coiling itself for action. </p> <p>Ali has developed his musical style almost entirely untainted by outside influences - although he did win a Grammy for his collaboration with Ry Cooder on Talking Timbuktu - so its similarities to Mississippi blues is uncanny. His songs were often slow, mournful and infinitely weary, with only some modal scales and keening vocal lines to suggest this music was looking east before it went west. Elsewhere, he applied his ringing, metallic guitar tone to springier tempos, peeling off jangling melodic lines bizarrely reminiscent of Merseybeat and The Byrds viewed through the freeform prism of John Coltrane. Although I don't suppose that's how he hears it. </p> <p>Boucoum's set shed a different light on the sounds of the Niger river. Where Toure's band (featuring several of the same musicians) appeared in simple shirts and trousers, Boucoum's team appeared in a dramatic assortment of hats, cloaks and capes. Their best pieces were constructed around relaxed but faintly menacing tempos, stretched over loping basslines and measured out in clattering cross-rhythms. Boucoum's guitar playing is stringy and nagging where Toure's bubbles effervescently, but it makes a perfect fit with the long, slow currents of his songs. I reckon Toure's right, though - this music wasn't designed for the Barbican Hall. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Fierce competition in the mobile phone market sent prices tumbling by 17% last year with even deeper cuts in the burgeoning pre-pay market, the regulator Oftel said yesterday. </p> <p>The watchdog used the figures to argue there was no need for intervention to force further reductions. Pre-pay, which has accounted for much of the market's growth in the past year and where the scramble for customers is most intense, saw prices fall by 23% on average. </p> <p>\"Prices of mobiles continue to fall,\" said Oftel director general David Edmonds. </p> <p>\"Our review shows that increasing competition means consumers are getting cheaper calls from their mobile phones which supports our view that competition really is the best way to deliver lower prices.\" </p> <p>Oftel would continue to monitor prices, with a further review of the market due to be carried out later this year. </p> <p>During 1999 the price of calling mobiles from a fixed line also fell by around 25% as a result of action by the regulator.

      "bodyText": "Fierce competition in the mobile phone market sent prices tumbling by 17% last year with even deeper cuts in the burgeoning pre-pay market, the regulator Oftel said yesterday. The watchdog used the figures to argue there was no need for intervention to force further reductions. Pre-pay, which has accounted for much of the market's growth in the past year and where the scramble for customers is most intense, saw prices fall by 23% on average. \"Prices of mobiles continue to fall,\" said Oftel director general David Edmonds. \"Our review shows that increasing competition means consumers are getting cheaper calls from their mobile phones which supports our view that competition really is the best way to deliver lower prices.\" Oftel would continue to monitor prices, with a further review of the market due to be carried out later this year. During 1999 the price of calling mobiles from a fixed line also fell by around 25% as a result of action by the regulator. It is now aiming to improve pricing transparency between the four networks. The market has undergone explosive growth in the past 12 months: one in four Britons now owns a mobile phone. During the last three months of 1999, 4.4m mobile phones were sold, taking the UK total to 24m - more than one per household.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A controlled panic spread through the French banking system yesterday after computer hackers sent emails to banks detailing a formula for creating and using plastic cards which can fool electronic safeguards. </p> <p>The Bank of France ordered the rapid introduction of new security measures after bank card operators admitted that their system, which uses microchip integrated plastic, was \"vulnerable\". </p> <p>A month ago the Groupement des Cartes Bancaires, which administers Mastercard, Visa and other widely used charge cards, said it was not possible to crack the existing system of electronic protection. However, it has since emerged that that system has not been reviewed since 1985. </p> <p>The reassurances were given before the trial of Serge Humpich, a programmer who received a 10-month suspended jail term when he was found guilty of using a homemade card which he claimed could deceive all electronic safeguards. </p> <p>Humpich was charged with fraud after demanding \u00a320m to disclose the secret formula and offering help in setting up a fail-safe system. </p> <p>Humpich said his invention was smart enough to unravel a 96-number code and to persuade electronic bank guards to allow him access to the vaults. He proved his case by buying M\u00e9tro tickets from a distributor, but was arrested while negotiating with bank officials. </p> <p>Humpich's sentence appears to have angered hackers, including two who go by the names of Anie Nomat and Mail. They sent the formula for homemade bank cards from cyber cafes at the Od\u00e9on and the Boulevard Saint-Michel, in the student quarter in central Paris. </p> <p>Bank detectives have drawn a blank in establishing their true identities. </p> <p>After a complaint to the police, the formula vanished from the internet but not before banks and many private subscribers had been emailed information on how to make cards using equipment worth about \u00a3250 that can be bought on the internet. </p> <p>The information included deciphered codes to validate forgeries when microchip-carrying cards were fed into cash dispensers or mobile phone-style terminals used by most shops and banks. </p> <p>These are linked to central accounting, which carries out immediate debits as soon as the terminal reads the card number and the user enters his or her PIN number, without a signature being required. </p> <p>Cryptographers who helped to dismantle the bank code said it had been a simple task because France was not yet protected by the same international security safeguards that protect Eurocard, Visa and Mastercard. </p> <p>\"It's possible to make cards carrying any PIN number you like,\" Humpich said. \"They can be totally invented or real. Any hacker can pick up the first numbers from discarded cash dispenser receipts and then debit existing accounts.\" </p> <p>During Humpich's trial, banks claimed his method posed no threat. But they have since admitted that his cards could be used to buy petrol or rail tickets, and to withdraw money from supermarket cash dispensers and rural banks. These terminals are not directly connected to central accounting. </p> <p>Herv\u00e9 de Lacotte, a spokesman for the Groupement des Cartes Bancaires, admitted that some of the banks' equipment was \"vul nerable\", but said there was no risk of loss to customers, only to the banks. But a security overhaul was not expected to be completed before 2004. </p> <p>Jacques Stern, a cryptography professor, said specialists had warned banks of potential loopholes in security when France introduced microchip integrated plastic in 1985. </p> <p>\"But nothing was done about it,\" Prof Stern added. \"Microchip cards are a remarkable invention but security updating has been forgotten for 15 years.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A controlled panic spread through the French banking system yesterday after computer hackers sent emails to banks detailing a formula for creating and using plastic cards which can fool electronic safeguards. The Bank of France ordered the rapid introduction of new security measures after bank card operators admitted that their system, which uses microchip integrated plastic, was \"vulnerable\". A month ago the Groupement des Cartes Bancaires, which administers Mastercard, Visa and other widely used charge cards, said it was not possible to crack the existing system of electronic protection. However, it has since emerged that that system has not been reviewed since 1985. The reassurances were given before the trial of Serge Humpich, a programmer who received a 10-month suspended jail term when he was found guilty of using a homemade card which he claimed could deceive all electronic safeguards. Humpich was charged with fraud after demanding \u00a320m to disclose the secret formula and offering help in setting up a fail-safe system. Humpich said his invention was smart enough to unravel a 96-number code and to persuade electronic bank guards to allow him access to the vaults. He proved his case by buying M\u00e9tro tickets from a distributor, but was arrested while negotiating with bank officials. Humpich's sentence appears to have angered hackers, including two who go by the names of Anie Nomat and Mail. They sent the formula for homemade bank cards from cyber cafes at the Od\u00e9on and the Boulevard Saint-Michel, in the student quarter in central Paris. Bank detectives have drawn a blank in establishing their true identities. After a complaint to the police, the formula vanished from the internet but not before banks and many private subscribers had been emailed information on how to make cards using equipment worth about \u00a3250 that can be bought on the internet. The information included deciphered codes to validate forgeries when microchip-carrying cards were fed into cash dispensers or mobile phone-style terminals used by most shops and banks. These are linked to central accounting, which carries out immediate debits as soon as the terminal reads the card number and the user enters his or her PIN number, without a signature being required. Cryptographers who helped to dismantle the bank code said it had been a simple task because France was not yet protected by the same international security safeguards that protect Eurocard, Visa and Mastercard. \"It's possible to make cards carrying any PIN number you like,\" Humpich said. \"They can be totally invented or real. Any hacker can pick up the first numbers from discarded cash dispenser receipts and then debit existing accounts.\" During Humpich's trial, banks claimed his method posed no threat. But they have since admitted that his cards could be used to buy petrol or rail tickets, and to withdraw money from supermarket cash dispensers and rural banks. These terminals are not directly connected to central accounting. Herv\u00e9 de Lacotte, a spokesman for the Groupement des Cartes Bancaires, admitted that some of the banks' equipment was \"vul nerable\", but said there was no risk of loss to customers, only to the banks. But a security overhaul was not expected to be completed before 2004. Jacques Stern, a cryptography professor, said specialists had warned banks of potential loopholes in security when France introduced microchip integrated plastic in 1985. \"But nothing was done about it,\" Prof Stern added. \"Microchip cards are a remarkable invention but security updating has been forgotten for 15 years.\"",
