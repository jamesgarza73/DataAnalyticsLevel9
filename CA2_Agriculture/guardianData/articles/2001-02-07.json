I don't know where to look for a summer holiday that we can both enjoy. We both want to go somewhere warm and preferably near the sea. We both dislike noisy crowds and over-commercial resorts. But beyond that, we have different needs: She would like to be able to meet other teenagers and take her first steps towards a safe night-life. I would like to be able to encounter aspects of the culture we are visiting and find a quiet place to read. Are we asking the impossible? Has anyone got any suggestions?  <br />Lee Bennett",

Most clubs also arrange excellent tours to nearby attractions which might interest the traveller in you, but might bore your daughter.

My advice is to go to Italy, to one of the many holiday villages along the Adriatic coast. These offer excellent facilities for the daytime, and have a variety of accommodation from bungalows to hotel rooms, fully equipped trailers, caravans and tents, and many activities for all ages (sport, music, etc). They are usually packed with teenagers from all over Europe so your daughter shouldn't have any trouble making friends. And there is obviously the appeal of the good food and great culture. If you go to Jesolo (just north of Venice) there is excellent nightlife, and you are about 20 miles from Venice. You can take day trips as far as Verona and go to see the opera in the Arena. Holiday resorts often organise coaches to nightclubs so that teenagers can go for a couple of hours, knowing they have a safe lift back. <br>Linda Lo Castro</p> <p> \u0095 When our daughter was in her teens (and since) we had a number of holidays with Club Med. It provides the nearest thing to a safe environment in which to experiment with being grown up, ie going to the Club-run nightclub but only having a short walk back to your room. The centre part of each village is noisy and bouncy with lots going on at certain times of the day but there are always quiet areas. There are lots of activities to join in with, and in doing that you do get to know people. The atmosphere is very international: in some villages French is very much the main language, in others French and English are used more equally. There are excursions to visit local attractions and historic places, and it is well worth organising yourself to go out of the village so as to get to know the country in which the club is situated! <br>Margaret Gregory</p> <p>\u0095 I would like to suggest Turkey. We have been twice through Tapestry holidays who have a selection of uncommercial resorts in beautiful locations. Although we had no teenagers with us we did talk to several families who said it was wonderful for young people, and we made friends with some teenage girls who were enjoying themselves very much. There were plenty of places for quiet reading plus opportunities for cultural visits and superb swimming. Good luck. <br>Bousfields</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>2000: Prince of Wales v the Sunday Times</strong><br><strong>Complaint:</strong> Prince Charles took the unprecedented step of objecting to a story after the newspaper claimed that he planned to marry Camilla Parker Bowles. </p> <p>The offending article claimed that he and Mrs Parker Bowles were in secret discussions with the Church of Scotland about a possible wedding in Scotland. The Church of Scotland permitted divorcees to marry in church.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> After an intervention from the PCC, the Sunday Times climbed down and printed a correction and page 2 apology. The paper said: \"The story was based on information from a source close to the Church of Scotland. Following assurances from St James's Palace that there was no foundation to this story, we acknowledge that the story was inaccurate and are happy to set the record straight. We apologise for the error.\" </p> <p><strong>2000: Carol Smillie v Sunday Mail</strong><br><strong>Complaint:</strong> The BBC presenter claimed that a report in the Sunday Mail headlined \"TV star Carol's grief over mum\" was intrusive. The article, on the front page and two inside pages, reported the funeral of Ms Smillie's mother and was accompanied by pictures taken outside the crematorium. </p> <p>Her solicitors said that the piece was an unjustified intrusion into Ms Smillie's grief which had been compounded by its prominence. Photographers at the church had been asked to leave, but the mourners had not noticed those at the crematorium, who were clearly some way away using long-lens photography.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The complaint was upheld. The PCC deemed it a breach of the code of practice. </p> <p><strong>2000: Jacquline Pirie/Granada Television v the News of the World</strong><br><strong>Complaint:</strong> The Coronation Street star was appalled by an article headlined \"Street star's 8-month marathon of lust\", which labelled her as a \"man eater\" in a \"kiss and tell\" sold to the paper by a former fiance, who divulged intimate details of their sexual relationship.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Complaint is upheld. The newspaper had pointed to the fact that an article in another newspaper by a former boyfriend had been published without complaint, but the commission did not consider this a valid justification for further intrusion into her privacy.</p> <p><strong>2000: Prince William v OK! Magazine</strong><br><strong>Complaint:</strong> The publication of photographs taken of the prince in Chile during his gap year despite the PCC's ruling in the wake of Princess Diana's death. The editor argued that the jungles of Chile were a public place and thus the photos were not taken as a result of persistent pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Upheld. The PCC deemed that Prince William was not in a place where photographers would normally have been and must, therefore, have been followed there by foreign paparazzi.</p> <p><strong>1999: Tony and Cherie Blair v the Mail on Sunday</strong><br><strong>Complaint:</strong> A front page headline - Parents' fury over Blairs in school place row - claimed that the prime minister's daughter had unfairly gained a place at the Sacred Heart high school in Hammersmith at the expense of other children. The prime minister and Mrs Blair were not poor, the leader commented, and could have paid for private education instead. </p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The complaint was upheld as there was no evidence of special treatment in her favour.

      "bodyText": "2000: Prince of Wales v the Sunday Times Complaint: Prince Charles took the unprecedented step of objecting to a story after the newspaper claimed that he planned to marry Camilla Parker Bowles. The offending article claimed that he and Mrs Parker Bowles were in secret discussions with the Church of Scotland about a possible wedding in Scotland. The Church of Scotland permitted divorcees to marry in church. Verdict: After an intervention from the PCC, the Sunday Times climbed down and printed a correction and page 2 apology. The paper said: \"The story was based on information from a source close to the Church of Scotland. Following assurances from St James's Palace that there was no foundation to this story, we acknowledge that the story was inaccurate and are happy to set the record straight. We apologise for the error.\" 2000: Carol Smillie v Sunday Mail Complaint: The BBC presenter claimed that a report in the Sunday Mail headlined \"TV star Carol's grief over mum\" was intrusive. The article, on the front page and two inside pages, reported the funeral of Ms Smillie's mother and was accompanied by pictures taken outside the crematorium. Her solicitors said that the piece was an unjustified intrusion into Ms Smillie's grief which had been compounded by its prominence. Photographers at the church had been asked to leave, but the mourners had not noticed those at the crematorium, who were clearly some way away using long-lens photography. Verdict: The complaint was upheld. The PCC deemed it a breach of the code of practice. 2000: Jacquline Pirie/Granada Television v the News of the World Complaint: The Coronation Street star was appalled by an article headlined \"Street star's 8-month marathon of lust\", which labelled her as a \"man eater\" in a \"kiss and tell\" sold to the paper by a former fiance, who divulged intimate details of their sexual relationship. Verdict: Complaint is upheld. The newspaper had pointed to the fact that an article in another newspaper by a former boyfriend had been published without complaint, but the commission did not consider this a valid justification for further intrusion into her privacy. 2000: Prince William v OK! Magazine Complaint: The publication of photographs taken of the prince in Chile during his gap year despite the PCC's ruling in the wake of Princess Diana's death. The editor argued that the jungles of Chile were a public place and thus the photos were not taken as a result of persistent pursuit. Verdict: Upheld. The PCC deemed that Prince William was not in a place where photographers would normally have been and must, therefore, have been followed there by foreign paparazzi. 1999: Tony and Cherie Blair v the Mail on Sunday Complaint: A front page headline - Parents' fury over Blairs in school place row - claimed that the prime minister's daughter had unfairly gained a place at the Sacred Heart high school in Hammersmith at the expense of other children. The prime minister and Mrs Blair were not poor, the leader commented, and could have paid for private education instead. Verdict: The complaint was upheld as there was no evidence of special treatment in her favour. In breach of clauses on accuracy and on children. 2000: The PCC v Piers Morgan Complaint: That Mr Morgan, the Mirror editor, had breach newspaper codes on ethical financial journalism after he bought shares in a company tipped by his City Slickers column. Verdict: The PCC found he had breached the newspaper code on three counts and was forced to publish a four-page apology. Although it looked like a harsh rebuke, Mr Morgan, 35, survived and was given the backing of Trinity Mirror bosses. The share-dealing is still being investigated by the Department of Trade and Industry. 1998: George Michael v the Sun Complaint: The paper gave away the location of the singer's new house by publishing a map and photographs alongside the article. Verdict: The following apology was published in the Sun: \"An article about George Michael 's new home, published on May 25 1998, was accompanied by a map of the area and photographs of the mews in which he lives. We are sorry if these identified the whereabouts of his home as this was not our intention.\" 1997: The press v the PCC on Princess Diana The code of practice was tightened after the death in 1997 of Princess Diana. Guidelines on long-lens photography banned the paparazzi from private property, including restaurants and churches. It was the first time the PCC had defined precisely what constituted private property. Lord Wakeham made it clear that celebrities bathing on public beaches could not expect to be off limits, hence the continuing use of paparazzi pictures of celebrities such as Michael Winner and Sir David Frost displaying their paunches on the seashores. New controls on doorstepping were also introduced, stopping hordes of journalists (and particularly TV cameras) camping at private addresses in the hope of getting an interview. 1995: Judy Finnigan and Richard Madeley v the Daily Mail Complaint: After Judy, the queen of daytime TV, appeared on This Morning with a black eye, the Mail rang an article asking \"What IS up with Judy?\" The couple complained that the paper had used the incident to \"peddle unsubstantiated old rumours and tittle tattle\" about their private life. They also complained that Judy's elderly mother had been harassed by the paper, which sent a reporter to her home and telephoned her. Verdict: The complaint was not upheld. The PCC said it saw no reason why polite and discreet approaches could not be made about public personalities. 1996: The press v PCC on the Rosemary West trial Complaint: The courts expressed concern that trials could be prejudiced when witnesses were paid to tell their stories to newspapers. The alarm bells rang following revelations that several witnesses in the West trial had lined up lucrative deals with the tabloids following the verdict. Verdict: The PCC tightened up its rules outlawing payments except in cases of overriding public interest. 1995: Selina Scott v the News of the World Complaint: Ms Scott, then one of Britain's biggest television stars, was furious after the Sunday paper in a \"kiss and tell\" classic had an affair with a man 15 years earlier. \"It was a downright lie,\" Ms Scott told the PCC. \"I have never slept with the man in my life.\" Verdict: Complaint upheld. 1995: Lady Victoria Spencer v the News of the World Complaint: On behalf of his wife, Earl Spencer complained about a story headlined \"Di's sister-in-law in booze and bulimia clinic\" which included a photograph of Lady Spencer taken with a telephoto lens. Verdict: News of the World writer Piers Morgan was subjected to a public flogging following the investigation by the PCC, which agreed with Earl Spencer that his wife's privacy had been invaded. The PCC chairman, Lord Wakeham, was so determined to make an example of Mr Morgan, he somehow forced his boss, Rupert Murdoch, to reprimand his wayward editor by way of a public letter. \"The young man went over the top,\" said Mr Murdoch. 1994: Germaine Greer v the Mail on Sunday Complaint: Germaine Greer was fuming when a young journalist from the Mail on Sunday won his way into her house by pretending to be one of the homeless to whom she had made the offer of free accommodation. Verdict: The complaint was upheld.

Then, she said, secret service agents came out yelling \"drop it\" while shouting at a man who sat slowly down on the ground. Another witness, Martin Manley, told CNN the gunman, \"was just standing in the street and randomly fired a few shots\". He said the man jumped into bushes and was surrounded by police but initially refused to surrender. \"Police were talking to him, telling him 'it doesn't have to be this way, put the gun down'. Then I heard one shot and the police all rushed in\". Secret service agents and police surrounded the White House after the incident at around 11:30am local time (1730GMT).

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>What makes Oxford so special</strong></p> <p>Being an Oxford United supporter means never having a dull moment as the clubs lurches from crisis to crisis, with the occasional silver lining making its presence known. None of this has deterred a hard core of around 4,000 supporters following the club as it languishes at the foot of the Second Division, and it is United's supporters which make the club so special. </p> <p>From as far back as the Southern League days of the 1950s the supporters pulled together to raise funds and actually build the stands at the Manor. More recently they clubbed together to deliver food parcels to the backroom staff when they had to endure two months without pay, and the independent supporters group FOUL (Fighting for Oxford United's Life) has been instrumental in ensuring the survival of the club during the past two years of City Council hesitation and many other obstacles as the club has struggled to build its new stadium.</p> <p><strong>The high points</strong></p> <p>The high point for most Us supporters is undoubtedly the 1986 Milk Cup final victory at Wembley, during United's first year in the (proper) First Division. Oxford beat QPR, managed by former United boss Jim Smith, 3-0 to record the highest winning margin at Wembley in the League Cup (to give the tournament its real name). </p> <p>In fact, the only player in a yellow shirt playing for United who had arrived since Smith's departure ten months earlier was the inspirational Ray Houghton. The victory was rounded off by a wonderful gesture from the late Maurice Evans, when the United manager sent physio Ken Fish up the steps to collect the winners medal in his place.</p> <p><strong>The low points</strong></p> <p>The low point, and there are so many to choose from, may be just around the corner as the latest legal challenge to the new ground at Minchery Farm could cause chairman Firoz Kassam finally to throw in the towel and walk away, leaving United to the administrators and, probably, worse. </p> <p>The lowest point that has actually occurred was that period just over two years ago when the club had no money to pay backroom staff wages, players were being sold for a fraction of their value just to keep the bank from foreclosing and results were indicative of the off-the-field turmoil. There was one specific 2-0 defeat at Watford when the team was forced to wear the Hornets' away strip, their own having been left in Oxford, leading to rumours that United had been unable to pay the laundry bill and the club was on the brink of closure. The frightening thing is that at the time these rumours were deemed entirely credible.</p> <p><strong>How we're doing at the moment</strong></p> <p>At the moment the team's performances have led to United becoming the laughing stock of the football league, with even Cambridge or Colchester looking forward to our visit in the knowledge that three points is virtually guaranteed them. In the whole squad there are maybe half a dozen players of the required standard to keep United in the Second Division but there is not one who is a natural captain. </p> <p>However, all this pales into insignificance compared to events off the field where yet again the club is fighting a legal battle in an attempt to prevent work on the new stadium, recommenced in November after a four-year gap, from stopping again. This time it is an adjacent landowner who has been given leave to seek a judicial review into the granting of planning permission for a multiplex cinema in the leisure complex adjacent to the stadium, and on which the ground is dependent for funding. The review process could last anything from three months to a year, but with the work scheduled for a late July finish and Oxford needing the stadium before the start of next season, any delay could be potentially fatal.</p> <p><strong>Our last game</strong></p> <p>United's last game was an abject capitulation at Peterborough, where the U's went down 4-2 despite, or possibly because of, taking a 19th-minute lead through Matt Murphy. One of the hallmarks of Oxford's recent form has been their inability to hold onto a lead, even a two-goal lead on more than one occasion, and so going ahead so early is always going to be dangerous given the club's penchant for self-destruction. </p> <p><strong>Our next game</strong></p> <p>Next up, United welcome Wycombe to the Manor which, for the Chairboys at least, should be an entertaining derby. Oxford still doesn't regard its nearest neighbours as true rivals, reserving that accolade for Swindon, but some spice should be added by the fact that we still haven't beaten Wanderers at the Manor in the league. Optimism dictates that we should be worth a draw, but realism is likely to rear its ugly head and give United a 2-1 defeat. After going ahead, of course.</p> <p><strong>Sore point</strong></p> <p>The current sore point must surely be the departure of Joe Kinnear, who left his position as Director of Football last week citing family and health reasons. Fair enough, except he has now commenced the same position at Luton Town, just one place above Oxford in the league. This leads one to suspect that Mr Kinnear was being somewhat economical with the truth and, if the rumours that his move to the Hatters was arranged prior to Christmas are true, he has embarrassed himself, the club and his friend, chairman Firoz Kassam.</p> <p><strong> The chairman</strong></p> <p>Firoz Kassam took over United two years ago, just as it seemed that the club was going to have to fold. He had no footballing background but was a successful, and very rich, hotelier. His time at Oxford has been dogged by controversy and he has been on the verge of leaving more than once, but he has stuck with it and his determination was rewarded when Birse Construction began work at Minchery Farm at the end of last year. </p> <p>Supporters of Oxford are still split in their assessment of Kassam: is he an unscrupulous businessman using the club as a tool for a lucrative hotel and leisure complex, or is he a neophyte fan who has ploughed millions into the club with little or no likelihood of recouping his investment? Time will tell, but the majority of fans are inclined towards the more generous viewpoint. Whatever his motives, though, Kassam's presence has guaranteed at least two more years of professional football in Oxford than appeared likely the day before he arrived on the scene.</p> <p><strong>Our traditional rivals</strong></p> <p>A number of clubs claim to be United's rivals, including the aforementioned Wycombe as well as Reading, but it's only Swindon Town that really excites the emotions up the Manor. Why it should be the Robins rather than the Biscuitmen is more due to our poor record against the team from the wrong end of the A420 than any logical reason. Indeed, logic would dictate that Reading should receive our ire following the ill-fated attempt of Robert Maxwell to merge the two clubs. However, it is the fact that the U's have only ever won once at the County Ground that means we save up our fervour for a visit to Wiltshire more than anywhere else. </p> <p>The feud even led to an all-out war between the two local papers a few years ago, the Oxford Mail firing the first shots with a story listing the advantages of living in Oxford over Swindon. Whilst most United supporters are resigned to relegation this season, the pill will be sweetened immensely if we are joined in the Third Division by our local rivals.</p> <p><strong>Our kit</strong></p> <p>The current kit is the least popular creation that Oxford players have ever had the misfortune to turn out in. United used to play in old gold and black, similar to Wolves, and in the early seventies this changed to yellow and royal blue. The blue later became navy and those are the colours that the club adopted until this season. The yellow is almost green and under floodlights it is a cause for eyestrain trying to spot the Oxford players, especially given their tendency to disappear anyway. This kit is even more unfortunate given that last season's was probably the best that the players have ever worn: plain, traditional yellow with no fancy design work to distract from the team's shortcomings. Marvellous.</p> <p><strong>Mascots</strong></p> <p>United have, thankfully, steadfastly refused to follow the ridiculous trend of dressing some poor chap in an oversized furry suit and pretending that he's some kind of talisman. The nearest we come is when local commercial radio station Fox FM sends their Freddy the Fox character to the Manor, which doesn't happen too often luckily, but the club's commercial team has always shared the fans' views that these creeping Americanisms are there to be withstood. Let's hope that this is a stance that continues.</p> <p><strong>Players we love</strong></p> <p>The current most popular player at United, and there aren't many popular players to choose from, is local boy Chris Hackett. Hackett, 17, only made his home debut in December against Northampton and capped off a defence-destroying performance with an excellent individual goal. Hackett is a former sprint champion and he has the pace to worry any defender. He is most effective on the right wing but has also been played up front. He has already been scouted by Premiership clubs but will hopefully show the same loyalty to United as the lad on the opposite wing, Joey Beauchamp. </p> <p>The most popular player ever to have donned the yellow shirt is probably John Aldridge, although Matty Elliott runs him a close second. Aldridge was largely responsible for bringing the Glory Years to Oxford in the mid-80s, whilst Elliott single-handedly made a sub-standard United into a decent First-Division team (we were eighth when he was sold to Leicester in December 1996 and narrowly avoided relegation that season). There are very few players from other teams that the United crowd readily accept, and all the ones who do receive the applause of the London Road end tend to be popular ex-Us.</p> <p><strong>Players we hate</strong></p> <p>As with any club with a record similar to Oxford's, there are a number of players who incite the wrath of the crowd, especially those on high salaries who are deemed to be under-performing. Included in this category are Steve Anthrobus, a centre-forward who has only scored three league goals in his eighteen months at the Manor, and Peter Fear, who constantly reminds us that he is an ex-Premiership player but whose commitment would be considered questionable in a Sunday League side. Matt Murphy also comes in for mass condemnation, although to be fair it's not really his fault that he doesn't have the ability to do the job that is asked of him, namely to play professional football. </p> <p>The least popular player ever to have played for United is harder to call, not due to a lack of possibilities. My personal bete noire is Billy \"the Whale\" Whitehurst, a lumbering oaf of a centre forward who was playing in the old First Division, about four divisions above his talent level. A lot of others cite Marco Gabbiadini, on loan for just four weeks from Derby but whose waistline was more prominent than his goalscoring prowess. </p> <p><strong>The ground </strong></p> <p>The Manor is a unique, but small and increasingly tatty, venue. It is consistently voted the worst ground in the country by away supporters who are kept behind anachronistic fences, but home fans will certainly miss the place when the time comes to leave. It is in the middle of residential Headington and as well as no parking facilities there is no room for expansion. </p> <p>As the capacity decreases season by season for safety reasons, the necessity to move has been apparent for many years and for the last three seasons the club has had to apply for special dispensation from the Football Licensing Authority in order to continue playing there. There is little chance for a fourth successive exemption and so, should Minchery Farm fail to be completed for whatever reason, United will have nowhere to play next season.</p> <p><strong>The crowd </strong></p> <p>The atmosphere at the Manor, especially on those midweek cup nights, has always been special and during the eighties the place was justifiably known as Fortress Manor, the home crowd often quoted as being United's special advantage (along with the sloping pitch, of course). Nowadays there are no chants unique to United and there is an unfortunate minority which insists on thinking that it is big and clever to sing No Surrender. These are most likely the same people who throw coins at opposition goalkeepers and who tore the goal nets down at Macclesfield. Sadly there are some United fans who are still living in the 1970s.</p> <p><strong>Local knowledge</strong></p> <p>The best pub near the ground is the Butchers Arms, a Fullers pub which is also away-fan friendly (although not to Chelsea fans, after their last visit to the Manor). There are a number of other decent hostelries around Headington, including the Black Boy, the Bell and the White Hart down nearby back streets. Most away fans will notice the White Horse, the Britannia and the Royal Standard, being as they are on the main London Road, although if it's real ale you want then these are not the places to frequent. For food there is Smart's Fish and Chips close to the ground and not too far away is the Mediterranean Fish Bar.

Two others - Mad Ox Review and Shott Away - only lasted for one and two issues respectively. Recently some independent United websites have ceased functioning, leaving the official site (which has improved immeasurably recently), the Rivals.com site (which has deteriorated), the From the Terraces site and the recently revamped Oxford Mail site as the primary ports of call for Oxford supporters.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What makes Oxford so special Being an Oxford United supporter means never having a dull moment as the clubs lurches from crisis to crisis, with the occasional silver lining making its presence known. None of this has deterred a hard core of around 4,000 supporters following the club as it languishes at the foot of the Second Division, and it is United's supporters which make the club so special. From as far back as the Southern League days of the 1950s the supporters pulled together to raise funds and actually build the stands at the Manor. More recently they clubbed together to deliver food parcels to the backroom staff when they had to endure two months without pay, and the independent supporters group FOUL (Fighting for Oxford United's Life) has been instrumental in ensuring the survival of the club during the past two years of City Council hesitation and many other obstacles as the club has struggled to build its new stadium. The high points The high point for most Us supporters is undoubtedly the 1986 Milk Cup final victory at Wembley, during United's first year in the (proper) First Division. Oxford beat QPR, managed by former United boss Jim Smith, 3-0 to record the highest winning margin at Wembley in the League Cup (to give the tournament its real name). In fact, the only player in a yellow shirt playing for United who had arrived since Smith's departure ten months earlier was the inspirational Ray Houghton. The victory was rounded off by a wonderful gesture from the late Maurice Evans, when the United manager sent physio Ken Fish up the steps to collect the winners medal in his place. The low points The low point, and there are so many to choose from, may be just around the corner as the latest legal challenge to the new ground at Minchery Farm could cause chairman Firoz Kassam finally to throw in the towel and walk away, leaving United to the administrators and, probably, worse. The lowest point that has actually occurred was that period just over two years ago when the club had no money to pay backroom staff wages, players were being sold for a fraction of their value just to keep the bank from foreclosing and results were indicative of the off-the-field turmoil. There was one specific 2-0 defeat at Watford when the team was forced to wear the Hornets' away strip, their own having been left in Oxford, leading to rumours that United had been unable to pay the laundry bill and the club was on the brink of closure. The frightening thing is that at the time these rumours were deemed entirely credible. How we're doing at the moment At the moment the team's performances have led to United becoming the laughing stock of the football league, with even Cambridge or Colchester looking forward to our visit in the knowledge that three points is virtually guaranteed them. In the whole squad there are maybe half a dozen players of the required standard to keep United in the Second Division but there is not one who is a natural captain. However, all this pales into insignificance compared to events off the field where yet again the club is fighting a legal battle in an attempt to prevent work on the new stadium, recommenced in November after a four-year gap, from stopping again. This time it is an adjacent landowner who has been given leave to seek a judicial review into the granting of planning permission for a multiplex cinema in the leisure complex adjacent to the stadium, and on which the ground is dependent for funding. The review process could last anything from three months to a year, but with the work scheduled for a late July finish and Oxford needing the stadium before the start of next season, any delay could be potentially fatal. Our last game United's last game was an abject capitulation at Peterborough, where the U's went down 4-2 despite, or possibly because of, taking a 19th-minute lead through Matt Murphy. One of the hallmarks of Oxford's recent form has been their inability to hold onto a lead, even a two-goal lead on more than one occasion, and so going ahead so early is always going to be dangerous given the club's penchant for self-destruction. Our next game Next up, United welcome Wycombe to the Manor which, for the Chairboys at least, should be an entertaining derby. Oxford still doesn't regard its nearest neighbours as true rivals, reserving that accolade for Swindon, but some spice should be added by the fact that we still haven't beaten Wanderers at the Manor in the league. Optimism dictates that we should be worth a draw, but realism is likely to rear its ugly head and give United a 2-1 defeat. After going ahead, of course. Sore point The current sore point must surely be the departure of Joe Kinnear, who left his position as Director of Football last week citing family and health reasons. Fair enough, except he has now commenced the same position at Luton Town, just one place above Oxford in the league. This leads one to suspect that Mr Kinnear was being somewhat economical with the truth and, if the rumours that his move to the Hatters was arranged prior to Christmas are true, he has embarrassed himself, the club and his friend, chairman Firoz Kassam. The chairman Firoz Kassam took over United two years ago, just as it seemed that the club was going to have to fold. He had no footballing background but was a successful, and very rich, hotelier. His time at Oxford has been dogged by controversy and he has been on the verge of leaving more than once, but he has stuck with it and his determination was rewarded when Birse Construction began work at Minchery Farm at the end of last year. Supporters of Oxford are still split in their assessment of Kassam: is he an unscrupulous businessman using the club as a tool for a lucrative hotel and leisure complex, or is he a neophyte fan who has ploughed millions into the club with little or no likelihood of recouping his investment? Time will tell, but the majority of fans are inclined towards the more generous viewpoint. Whatever his motives, though, Kassam's presence has guaranteed at least two more years of professional football in Oxford than appeared likely the day before he arrived on the scene. Our traditional rivals A number of clubs claim to be United's rivals, including the aforementioned Wycombe as well as Reading, but it's only Swindon Town that really excites the emotions up the Manor. Why it should be the Robins rather than the Biscuitmen is more due to our poor record against the team from the wrong end of the A420 than any logical reason. Indeed, logic would dictate that Reading should receive our ire following the ill-fated attempt of Robert Maxwell to merge the two clubs. However, it is the fact that the U's have only ever won once at the County Ground that means we save up our fervour for a visit to Wiltshire more than anywhere else. The feud even led to an all-out war between the two local papers a few years ago, the Oxford Mail firing the first shots with a story listing the advantages of living in Oxford over Swindon. Whilst most United supporters are resigned to relegation this season, the pill will be sweetened immensely if we are joined in the Third Division by our local rivals. Our kit The current kit is the least popular creation that Oxford players have ever had the misfortune to turn out in. United used to play in old gold and black, similar to Wolves, and in the early seventies this changed to yellow and royal blue. The blue later became navy and those are the colours that the club adopted until this season. The yellow is almost green and under floodlights it is a cause for eyestrain trying to spot the Oxford players, especially given their tendency to disappear anyway. This kit is even more unfortunate given that last season's was probably the best that the players have ever worn: plain, traditional yellow with no fancy design work to distract from the team's shortcomings. Marvellous. Mascots United have, thankfully, steadfastly refused to follow the ridiculous trend of dressing some poor chap in an oversized furry suit and pretending that he's some kind of talisman. The nearest we come is when local commercial radio station Fox FM sends their Freddy the Fox character to the Manor, which doesn't happen too often luckily, but the club's commercial team has always shared the fans' views that these creeping Americanisms are there to be withstood. Let's hope that this is a stance that continues. Players we love The current most popular player at United, and there aren't many popular players to choose from, is local boy Chris Hackett.

Bracknell Forest chief executive, Gordon Mitchell, said: \"Bracknell Forest is pleased to be the first authority to be appointing a black woman as its director of social services. Daphne got the job because she was the best candidate - she was chosen because of her ability.\" Ms Obang will become one of just two ethnic minority social services directors in the UK's 211 social services departments. The other is Dudley council's Chris Williams, the first ever Asian social services director. The appointment comes just a fortnight after the Royal College of Nursing appointed its first black general secretary, the US nursing union leader Beverly Malone. Ms Obang succeeds Trevor Farmer, who took early retirement last August just before an inspection by the social services inspectorate and the Audit Commission revealed serious problems with Bracknell's social services. The joint review report published last week uncovered staff vacancies of 16%, and a lack of strategic direction. Urgent areas for improvement listed by inspectors included assessments of children and adults, commissioning of services, quality assurance arrangements for services, and inter-agency partnerships, particularly with the voluntary sector. Ms Obang trained as a community psychiatric nurse and took up her first local authority post as a mental health social worker with Lewisham council in the early 1970s. Her career has spanned Croydon council, as assistant area team manager, Tower Hamlets, where she was manager for adult services and then resources manager, and Newham council as manager for mental health and learning difficulties services before being promoted to head of adult services. In 1997 she was appointed as one of five senior managers to run Camden social services department where she has been praised for playing a key role in modernising adult services and implementing innovative change. Ms Obang described the challenges at Bracknell Forest as not that different from the inner city problems experienced at Camden. She said: \"After having completed three and a half years at the London borough of Camden, I am now looking forward to an exciting and challenging time in the role of director of social services and housing at Bracknell Forest borough council.\" Moira Gibb, president of the Association of Directors of Social Services (ADSS), said: \"ADSS has been working hard to make sure that access to senior management posts in social services is open to all candidates with the proper skills, experience and qualifications. We hope Daphne's appointment is a sign that senior management in social services will progressively come to reflect the majority of our workforce and wider community.\" There have been four black social services directors in the UK, all of them men - Ram Ramadhan at Oldham council, Olsen Samuel at Haringey council, Patrick Kodikara at Camden council and David Divine at Brent council, all of whom are no longer social services directors.",

      "body": "<p>Charities have welcomed the government's announcement that it has dropped plans to force voluntary groups to pick up the bill for running security checks on community helpers.</p> <p>The proposal, which would have meant a \u00a310-\u00a315 vetting charge per volunteer, had outraged voluntary groups who claimed that it flew in the face of government plans to encourage an army of volunteers alongside the state. </p> <p>Each volunteeer would have been required to pay the full cost of a criminal records check with the new criminal records bureau. Some organisations, such as the Scouts, feared an annual charge of \u00a3650,000, and it was estimated the checks could cost the voluntary sector as a whole as much as \u00a315m a year. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett announced that the cost of vetting would be met by the government at a conference today, organised by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO).</p> <p>NCVO chief executive Stuart Etherington said: \"Charging volunteers for a police check would have acted as a major discincentive to volunteering and run counter to the government's aims of encouraging community activity.\"</p> <p>For the NSPCC, the announcement marks the successful end to an 18-month campaign on the issue of free record checks for the voluntary sector as a way of increasing child protection.</p> <p>Liz Atkins, NSPCC head of policy and public affairs, said: \"This is a great victory for child protection. It provides greater protection for children involved in community activities and gives parents peace of mind that their children are not in the care of known offenders.

      "bodyText": "Charities have welcomed the government's announcement that it has dropped plans to force voluntary groups to pick up the bill for running security checks on community helpers. The proposal, which would have meant a \u00a310-\u00a315 vetting charge per volunteer, had outraged voluntary groups who claimed that it flew in the face of government plans to encourage an army of volunteers alongside the state. Each volunteeer would have been required to pay the full cost of a criminal records check with the new criminal records bureau. Some organisations, such as the Scouts, feared an annual charge of \u00a3650,000, and it was estimated the checks could cost the voluntary sector as a whole as much as \u00a315m a year. Mr Blunkett announced that the cost of vetting would be met by the government at a conference today, organised by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO). NCVO chief executive Stuart Etherington said: \"Charging volunteers for a police check would have acted as a major discincentive to volunteering and run counter to the government's aims of encouraging community activity.\" For the NSPCC, the announcement marks the successful end to an 18-month campaign on the issue of free record checks for the voluntary sector as a way of increasing child protection. Liz Atkins, NSPCC head of policy and public affairs, said: \"This is a great victory for child protection. It provides greater protection for children involved in community activities and gives parents peace of mind that their children are not in the care of known offenders. We know sex offenders are cunning in gaining access to children. Today's announcement makes it far more difficult for paedophiles to infiltrate these organisations.\" Support for volunteering did not mean the government was off-loading its responsibilities, Mr Blunkett told the conference, but recognising that it cannot deliver all the services that are needed in the community. \"The government is engaging with the voluntary sector to expand and add value,\" he said. He also called on the voluntary sector to come up with ideas to increase access to funding. \"We want to cut bureaucracy,\" he said. The introduction of citizenship in the national curriculum was high on his agenda. \"We want young people to understand the part they play in the life of the community,\" he said. Again Mr Blunkett asked delegates to come up with ideas which were \"creative, not dreary and off-putting\" to engage young people. In an effort to increase the pool of potential volunteers, Mr Blunkett announced a relaxation in rules which deter jobless people from volunteering by requiring them to be available for work within 48 hours, as well as unveiling plans to encourage older people to give time to community work. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, recently called for a huge extension of volunteering, but his initiative was blunted by criticism over the criminal records charges. The lifting of the charge, which was to have been imposed from next year as part of an attempt to protect vulnerable people from paedophiles, was agreed yesterday between the Treasury, the Home Office and the Department for Education. The Scottish executive has already decided to provide free checks for volunteers. Mr Blunkett yesterday pledged an extra \u00a31m to the Community Champions fund, which encourages local people to contribute to their community. The fund is now in its second year and has so far helped more than 700 individuals and community groups to set up projects. The Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) has also secured a further \u00a31m a year from the Home Office Active Community fund allowing the programme to extend for a further three years. The DfEE works in partnership with individual leaders in the voluntary and community sector to galvanise local people into becoming more involved in community and regeneration activity. Mr Blunkett presented awards to 29 groups and individuals that have participated in the Community Champions fund. Winners include a Manchester sports programme that is working to cut crime and a project bringing IT to a rural community in Cornwall. He said: \"We need local people to get fully involved in driving change forward, if we are to see real improvements in our deprived communities. These 29 Community Champions are doing just that.

United will use the baseball giants huge merchandising network to target existing and new fans in the States. But United officials insist the deal does not mean they are looking to abandon the Premiership and become a 'superclub' in a breakaway league. Paddy Harverson, United's director of communications, said today: \"Manchester United are fully committed to the Premier League and domestic English football. \"There is no suggestion whatsoever that we are looking to leave the English game and join any kind of breakaway league.\" The Yankees will use United's own vast network in Europe and the Far East to sell their distinctive merchandise.

Under the deal, David Beckham and Fabien Barthez will be paraded at the Yankee Stadium, with Yankees' El Duque and outfielder Bernie Williams visiting Old Trafford. \"The YankeeNets are an icon sports organization,\" Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon said at a news conference in New York. \"Their executive staff know that North American markets better than anyone.

Kenyon and director Sir Bobby Charlton travelled to New York for the announcement. United, worth a staggering \u00a31bn, are already the richest football club in the world with revenue that dwarfs the rest of the Premiership and major European clubs like Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus. There are comparisons between United, who are chasing their seventh Premiership title in nine years, and the Yankees, who have won three of the last four titles - the World Series - and, in all, a record 26. United's \u00a31billion wealth is far in excess of the Yankees who are believed to be capitalised at around \u00a3400m. They are, however, the wealthiest baseball team in the United States.

      "bodyText": "Tradition has it that when a new Austrian government is sworn in they walk the short distance across Vienna's Ballhaus square to the imperial palace, basking in their success and greeting well-wishers along the way. Last February there were few well-wishers to be found amongst the paint-throwing, whistle-blowing, stone-hurling crowds who had tied black ribbons to the trees in angry protest at the new incumbents. Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel was forced to lead his cabinet through an underground passageway from Vienna's chancellery to the palace where their first meeting was to be held. The protesters were vocalising a Europe-wide wrath that Sch\u00fcssel's conservative People's party (\u00d6VP) which had come third in elections the previous October, had made a coalition pact with populist firebrand J\u00f6rg Haider, allowing his far-right Freedom party (FP\u00d6), which had gained over a quarter of the vote, into power. Pictures of President Thomas Klestil, steely-faced as he swore in a government of which he thoroughly disapproved, went round the world. The European Union immediately slapped sanctions on Austria and overnight the land of the Sound of Music became a pariah state. Recalling those heady days in a background press talk held recently in the winter garden of a hotel in Vienna city centre, a high-ranking \u00d6VP politician chuckled: \"Now we're sitting in a glass house, but a year ago we had to go via a tunnel for our swearing-in ceremony.\" He curiously seemed to see it as a metaphor for the stability the alpine republic has reverted to in such a short time. Nobody pointed out to him how vulnerable people in glass houses can be. But he is quite right in thinking that the dust has largely settled following elections which shook up an all too cosy political scene that had dominated Austrian politics for years. It pushed the Social Democrats into opposition, ending their staggeringly long 30-year grip on the chancellery. Few disagree that such a shake-up was long overdue. The EU sanctions that disappeared in a puff of smoke in September after they were deemed more harmful than helpful by three wise men from Brussels have now more or less been consigned to the history books. And according to economic observers, they did little harm to Austria's economy: two of their biggest exports, Red Bull and Wolford tights have reported no slump in demand. Tourism is booming. And while last year Belgium's foreign minister was declaring that it was \"immoral to ski in Austria\", launching an ad campaign for Belgian resorts showing an Austrian skier forming a swastika on his downhill run, this year Austria's St Anton is hosting the world's skiing championships. The reaction shown by the outside world shocked most Austrians to the core, but it also forced them to deal with many issues linked to the past which have been constantly pushed onto the Germans, or under the carpet. Most significantly, although not before time, a compensation fund for Nazi-era slave labourers and those deprived of their property by the Nazis is now in full swing. Other reforms are underway, including a huge wave of privatisation, moves to cut the infamous bureaucracy and a long-term stability programme to cancel a large budget deficit. But the unease about a country which collaborated closely with Nazi Germany and just over half a century later voted for a party whose leader had shown himself sympathetic to Nazi policies certainly remains. Relations between Vienna and its European partners, Paris and Berlin in particular, remain cool. And this week the fierce criticism received by the Count and Countess of Wessex for simply being caught on film with Haider's successor as FP\u00d6 leader, Susanne Riess-Passer, proved how damaging the prominence of the FP\u00d6 continues to be to Austria's image abroad. And what of the man at the eye of the storm, who benefited from Austrians' yearning for the new but who then renounced his leadership post to vice-chancellor Riess-Passer in May and retreated to the southern province of Carinthia where he is governor? Observers and acquaintances say the 51-year-old has now all but given up his lifelong dream to become chancellor, realising that there's hardly a leader in Europe who would dare to be seen shaking his hand. He snarls from the sidelines now and again, this week telling French president Jacques Chirac to stop behaving like Napoleon, but has largely lost the magic charm that won his party so many votes and is said to be bitter that although he remains its most dominant figure, his party appears to do just fine without him. Or maybe not. Despite its strong showing 16 months ago, the FP\u00d6 is struggling in the polls, putting in poor performances in regional elections and it's expected to suffer badly in Vienna's local elections next month. On the streets of Vienna the fight is still on to oust the government. Every Thursday evening a mix of young and old meet in front of the parliament building, demonstrating against a government which is identified by the party colours which make it up - black for the conservatives, blue for the Freedom party.

If I managed to get any teaching done it was a miracle. Most of my time was spent simply keeping the girls under control and stopping them from assaulting each other and, sometimes, even me. It was a major achievement just to get them to listen to what I was saying.</p> <p>\"You would go in at the beginning of the day trying to feel positive and with plenty of energy, but by the end of the day you were completely drained. It was soul-destroying. Often I was grateful just to be able to keep them all in the same room\".</p> <p>The school where Sarah worked was marked down by Ofsted for unsatisfactory teaching at key stage three - the 11-14 age group referred to in its report yesterday for a worrying downturn in discipline.</p> <p>Although she taught dance, drama and PE, Sarah also had to keep an eye out for looting from lockers, fires being started in wastepaper bins, vandalism and graffiti. There was even suspected drug use among older girls who were \"high as kites\" after lunchtime sessions in the toilets.</p> <p>Tackling parents about their children's poor behaviour created even more problems for teachers. \"Complaints to parents inevitably led to us being verbally and even physically abused when they took sides with their daughters,\" she said. \"On one occasion the police had to be called to physically remove a couple from the school premises.\"</p> <p>Now Sarah runs a learning support unit, or \"sin bin\", at another London school, where at least she is able to give pupils one-to-one advice on strategies to improve their behaviour, away from the chaos of the classroom.</p>",

But she said that despite seeing pupils taken to hospital after extreme incidents involving craft knives, what shocked her most was the constant foul language used by pupils towards staff. \"The pupils regularly told the teachers to fuck off,\" she explained. \"There was just no respect for us or what we were trying to do. If I managed to get any teaching done it was a miracle. Most of my time was spent simply keeping the girls under control and stopping them from assaulting each other and, sometimes, even me. It was a major achievement just to get them to listen to what I was saying. \"You would go in at the beginning of the day trying to feel positive and with plenty of energy, but by the end of the day you were completely drained. It was soul-destroying. Often I was grateful just to be able to keep them all in the same room\". The school where Sarah worked was marked down by Ofsted for unsatisfactory teaching at key stage three - the 11-14 age group referred to in its report yesterday for a worrying downturn in discipline. Although she taught dance, drama and PE, Sarah also had to keep an eye out for looting from lockers, fires being started in wastepaper bins, vandalism and graffiti. There was even suspected drug use among older girls who were \"high as kites\" after lunchtime sessions in the toilets. Tackling parents about their children's poor behaviour created even more problems for teachers. \"Complaints to parents inevitably led to us being verbally and even physically abused when they took sides with their daughters,\" she said. \"On one occasion the police had to be called to physically remove a couple from the school premises.\" Now Sarah runs a learning support unit, or \"sin bin\", at another London school, where at least she is able to give pupils one-to-one advice on strategies to improve their behaviour, away from the chaos of the classroom.",

      "body": "<p>Scotland's revolt over free personal care for all elderly people, regardless of their means, has thrown into sharp focus what devolution is going to mean in Britain. There had already been well publicised differences over student tuition fees, not to mention the recent 21% pay award for Scottish teachers, but the parting of the ways on long-term care has shown that very different patterns of social policy can now be expected. </p> <p>The differences, however, will not just be between England and Scotland. Important differences are emerging also in Wales, where the idea of a children's commissioner - doggedly opposed by English ministers - has been readily accepted and acted upon. </p> <p>Westminster has sought to appear relaxed about all this. John Hutton, health and social care minister, says: \"Devolution means that it is for the Scottish parliament to make decisions on its response to the royal commission on long-term care. Both the government and the Scottish executive are committed to improving health and social care services for older people, but we are doing this in different ways.\" </p> <p>Yet it is clear that when SMPs first proposed to accept the royal commission's recommendation that per sonal care should be free, which England and Wales had rejected, frantic efforts were made from London to head off the go-it-alone plan. Only the imminent collapse of the Labour/LibDem coalition in Scotland forced the Scottish executive to commit to free personal care for all \"as soon as practicable\". </p> <p>Historically, Scotland has always had different legal and education systems. Devolution alone is not the reason for diversity. Scottish children's hearings panels, which keep young offenders out of the court system, have long been held up as examples which the rest of Britain might follow. </p> <p>Scotland also had the misfortune to be the testing ground for the poll tax, introduced there in 1989 a year before England and Wales. Despite its appalling reception, the Tory government ploughed ahead with its introduction across Britain - with disastrous results. </p> <p>The establishment of a separate Scottish parliament in 1999, however, has underlined just how distinctive Scottish policy can become. The Welsh assembly, albeit with fewer powers than its Scottish equivalent, has similarly opened the door for policy contrasts. The assembly lost no time in agreeing to appoint a children's commissioner - Peter Clarke, now settled in the post - in response to the recommendation of the Water house inquiry into abuse in north Wales children's homes. Northern Ireland has also announced it is to have a commissioner and it looks as if Scotland will follow suit. But England, apparently, will not. </p> <p>So is this developing diversity a good thing? Or will loss of central control create dysfunction and widen existing fissures in British society? </p> <p>David Hinchliffe, Labour chair of the commons health select committee, has no doubt that what is happening in Scotland over long-term care is a positive step. \"This is the inevitability of devolution,\" he says. \"I have long looked to Scotland, having worked in social services, at things like their children's panels. The fact that they can have the ability to develop new approaches is very positive. In fact, I have come back from visiting social work schemes in Scotland and been green with envy.\" </p> <p>Hinchliffe personally welcomes the Scottish move towards free personal care. \"It is a development I don't see any problems with - but that is if you believe in devolution, which I do.\"And, as a Yorkshireman, he half jokes about the day his own beloved county will get devolved powers. </p> <p>In an ideal world, the four constituent countries of the UK might even learn lessons from diversity. But experience suggests not. A recent Northern Ireland report suggested that the province's joint health and social services boards have done little to improve joint working between the two sectors. Yet the Westminster government seems set on forcing England down the same route. </p> <p>While it is still too early to learn lessons from the Welsh children's commissioner, few observers can understand why English ministers already appear so resistant to the idea. \"Child abuse does not stop at the border between England and Wales,\" says Mary Marsh, the NSPCC chief executive. \"Similar posts must be created in the rest of the UK, with wide-ranging powers to investigate, report and act, so that children have the protection they deserve.\" </p> <p>Failing that, the NSPCC wants the Welsh commissioner to be allowed to comment on British government policies which affect children in Wales, such as the children's tax credit, youth justice and the national minimum wage for young people, and to have powers to investigate where a Welsh child is placed in England. </p> <p>Hugh Gardner, who chairs the Association of Directors of Social Services in Wales, argues that one of the positive aspects of devolution is closer relations between the centre and the grassroots. \"There really is a culture of partnership all the time,\" he says. \"The assembly has set out to try to encourage a variety of interests. They have users and carers coming to the social services committee, and the minister is there as well.\" </p> <p>Another emerging difference between Wales and England is that while checks on English childminders and nurseries will from September be carried out by the schools inspectorate, Ofsted, Welsh regulation will be by the care standards commission. \"It is seeing the children's interests in a wider context - not just education,\" says Gardner. </p> <p>With more coalition governments likely in Wales and Scotland, policies will have to adapt to encompass disparate opinions. They will also need to be more attuned to the ordinary elector, whose views - and votes - can hold far more sway than in national elections. \"How the next [general] election, the first since devolution, is going to pan out is going to be very interesting,\" says Mitchell. \"It will throw up a lot of anomalies. The devolved countries are becoming quite a force, putting pressure on Westminster to move forward.\" </p> <p>Lobbying groups will sometimes be able to use policies adopted in one country to put pressure on another. Scottish voluntary organisations scored a recent victory on charging for checks on people working with children, the Scottish executive agreeing to foot the fee of at least \u00a310 a head for every check carried out. Voluntary groups in England and Wales, however, will still have to pay. </p> <p>\"The Scottish decision is obviously very important,\" says Campbell Robb, head of campaigns at the London-based National Council for Voluntary Organisations. \"Hopefully, it will give us leverage in our ability to press the Home Office to have free checks.\" </p> <p>Martin Sim, chief executive of the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations, is delighted with the deal. \"At one level, across the UK, the government is trying to promote volunteers, yet another arm of government is saying it is going to cost you \u00a310 or \u00a315 to get checked,\" he says. \"That doesn't make a lot of sense.

Just a few days after the Scottish long-term care debacle, chancellor Gordon Brown told an audience in Manchester: \"We are moving away from the old Britain of subjects, where people had to look upwards to a Whitehall bureaucracy for their solutions, to a Britain of citizens where region to region, locality to locality, we are ourselves in charge.\" </p> <p>David Hinchliffe's home rule for Yorkshire may not, then, be just a distant dream. </p> <p><strong>Pioneers, not guinea pigs</strong></p> <p>It is not just social policy but health, too, which will differ under devolution.

      "bodyText": "Scotland's revolt over free personal care for all elderly people, regardless of their means, has thrown into sharp focus what devolution is going to mean in Britain. There had already been well publicised differences over student tuition fees, not to mention the recent 21% pay award for Scottish teachers, but the parting of the ways on long-term care has shown that very different patterns of social policy can now be expected. The differences, however, will not just be between England and Scotland. Important differences are emerging also in Wales, where the idea of a children's commissioner - doggedly opposed by English ministers - has been readily accepted and acted upon. Westminster has sought to appear relaxed about all this. John Hutton, health and social care minister, says: \"Devolution means that it is for the Scottish parliament to make decisions on its response to the royal commission on long-term care. Both the government and the Scottish executive are committed to improving health and social care services for older people, but we are doing this in different ways.\" Yet it is clear that when SMPs first proposed to accept the royal commission's recommendation that per sonal care should be free, which England and Wales had rejected, frantic efforts were made from London to head off the go-it-alone plan. Only the imminent collapse of the Labour/LibDem coalition in Scotland forced the Scottish executive to commit to free personal care for all \"as soon as practicable\". Historically, Scotland has always had different legal and education systems. Devolution alone is not the reason for diversity. Scottish children's hearings panels, which keep young offenders out of the court system, have long been held up as examples which the rest of Britain might follow. Scotland also had the misfortune to be the testing ground for the poll tax, introduced there in 1989 a year before England and Wales. Despite its appalling reception, the Tory government ploughed ahead with its introduction across Britain - with disastrous results. The establishment of a separate Scottish parliament in 1999, however, has underlined just how distinctive Scottish policy can become. The Welsh assembly, albeit with fewer powers than its Scottish equivalent, has similarly opened the door for policy contrasts. The assembly lost no time in agreeing to appoint a children's commissioner - Peter Clarke, now settled in the post - in response to the recommendation of the Water house inquiry into abuse in north Wales children's homes. Northern Ireland has also announced it is to have a commissioner and it looks as if Scotland will follow suit. But England, apparently, will not. So is this developing diversity a good thing?

      "body": "<p> Thank you for your invitation to address today's annual conference of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and for the opportunity to record my appreciation for the work that you do across Britain. </p> <p>Today I want to talk about the principled partnership that the next Conservative government will build with you. A principled partnership that will give the voluntary sector a voice at the top of government. A principled partnership that will revolutionise the process of applying for grants. A principled partnership that will give charities new opportunities to run schools, regenerate disadvantaged communities and take development projects to every corner of the globe.</p> <p>Twenty years ago the first Conservative revolution began. Battered by regulations, taxes and inflation the enterprise of British people - which had once produced the world's most prosperous country - was exhausted. </p> <p>That first Conservative revolution proved that there were no shortcuts to prosperity. I want to extend the same Conservative principles to the creation of a more compassionate society. It is not enough to define the economic limits of government.</p> <p>We must be realistic about the state's ability to address social needs too. Just as wealth creation depends upon the energies of a free people, a good society depends upon the active compassion of free and independent families, neighbours and charities.</p> <p>Fifty years ago Beveridge recognised this when he said: \"A good society depends not on the state, but on the citizens, acting on motives of various kinds, some selfish, others unselfish, some narrow and material, others inspired by love of man and love of God. The happiness or unhappiness of the society in which we live depends upon ourselves as citizens, not on the instrument of political power which we call the state.\"</p> <p>The next Conservative government will improve our public services and protect social security but we will not stop there. The Common Sense Revolution will actively recognise civil society's role in building one nation of opportunity and security for all.</p> <p>The pensioner who is lonely, the child who has never seen his father or the teenager turning to drugs don't always need another government initiative or taskforce of the great and good. They are crying out for the care and attention of another human being.</p> <p>And every day millions of people do show compassion to a child, neighbour or stranger. Within families and communities people find friendship, identity, and belonging. Many of life's greatest obstacles - bereavement, sickness or unemployment - are overcome because of the personal support of a parent, spouse or friend.</p> <p>But many active citizens are frustrated by the environment created by government. Volunteers are faced with expensive background checks. Applying for government grants involves navigating a jungle of bureaucracy. Political correctness forces charities and faith communities to dilute their essential character. </p> <p>These barriers that separate good neighbours from people in need must come down. That is why I favour \"denationalising compassion\". And that is why the next Conservative government will get off the back of charities, volunteers and families.</p> <p>Often government fails the voluntary sector by failing to even consider its perspective. By establishing an Office of Civil Society reporting to a cabinet minister, the next Conservative government will change this. This office will be staffed by charities, faith communities and family groups. The \"good neighbours\" who give our country its strength and decency. It is the boldest initiative of its kind for a generation.</p> <p>I am announcing the office's first four tasks today.</p> <p>First, we must end the huge diversion of your time into form-filling and paperwork. We must end the master-and-servant relationship between government and grant applicants. The complexity and number of application forms represents an intolerable burden and disenfranchises the smallest and often most innovative charities and community groups. There is a growing danger that groups that get money are the best at hacking the system rather than those who are best at the work in hand.</p> <p>The whole process can demoralise the charity workers closest to a project's ethos. Complex form-filling betrays the instincts of government to micromanage - managing inputs and process - rather than delivering results. We will still hold charities accountable for results, but the introduction of one simple form across government departments - made up of a la carte sections covering only essential funding considerations - will demonstrate our trust in charities.</p> <p>Second, the office will help us to end the lottery of identifying sources of funding. Information about grant opportunities is not the property of the government - but the property of every interested citizen. Modern technology gives us an opportunity to establish a one-stop website which will record basic information about all public sector grant opportunities. </p> <p>I would prefer that groups like the NCVO, the Charities Aid Foundation and the National Centre for Volunteering should be funded to manage this service. They are in the best position to know how this website would best serve their members. This one-stop portal follows our proposal to establish a similar system - Aid Direct - for international development.</p> <p>Third, the office will coordinate efforts to encourage greater independent sector involvement in public services. It is unreasonable, for example, to expect voluntary groups - often starved of funding for core functions - to be immediately ready to embark on the process of applying to run schools, housing or employment projects. </p> <p>The office will coordinate investment in the capacity of voluntary groups and faith communities - where they are interested - to seize the new opportunities. By involving the voluntary sector in schooling, housing and urban regeneration, we will create more diverse provision - better suited to the variety of needs in today's Britain. </p> <p>In education, for example, we will empower the pioneering work of black-majority churches to deliver the highest quality supplementary education to their communities. The office will also help government departments to improve their understanding of voluntary groups by giving civil servants access to training on these same possibilities of greater cooperation with voluntary groups. This training will include specific efforts to encourage more engagement with faith communities. </p> <p>Fourth, the office will produce a regular review of its work. This review will cover progress made on the Compact between the government and the voluntary sector. It will record trends in volunteering, charitable giving and how policy changes have affected marriage, parents and the extended family. It will examine the extent to which faith communities have been fairly receiving grants. In short it will bring consideration of civil society into the heart of government.</p> <p>The vital responsibility of international development will epitomise the Conservative approach to helping our neighbour. Through television and cheap and fast international travel we are right to think of the people affected by the Indian earthquake as our neighbours and that we can do something to help them. In the last year the British people have reached out their hand to their neighbours in Mozambique, El Salvador and Gujarat. Some of Britain's development charities have been the fastest and most effective agents of emergency aid as well as the most committed to long-term development projects. </p> <p>I can announce today that the next Conservative government will restructure the budget of the Department for International Development and so double the percentage of our development expenditure that goes through non-governmental organisations. By making it much simpler for small charities to apply for DFID grants we will ensure that these innovative charities take a big share of this doubled support for charitable groups.</p> <p>In partnership with the NGO community we will establish a sophisticated website and call centre to match needs in the developing world with willing helpers in Britain. We will invest in technology to twin individuals, charities and faith communities with partners in the developing world. We will also send an extra 5,000 young people to serve abroad every year.</p> <p>We all have a part to play in helping our neighbour overseas. As we move towards the UN target of giving 0.7% of GNP to international development the next Conservative government will play its full part. That will involve working in a fuller and more principled partnership with international development charities. But however much we improve the voluntary sector's relationship with government we need to do much more to improve the sector's relationship with the rest of civil society. </p> <p>This is essential if we are to encourage a genuinely \"independent sector\". When a charity depends upon the state for its income it can lose touch with the community - in the same way that a subsidised business loses touch with its customers. This can lead to charities imitating the management style and ethos of government. The voluntary sector becomes the compelled sector. Compelled to change its character according to its paymasters' demands. Compelled to jump through bureaucratic hoops in response to changing compliance criteria.</p> <p>A charity that receives a large share of its income from private citizens will be more diverse and innovative. And it won't just receive money. Ideas, time, encouragement and prayers will follow. The love that characterises the hospice movement is perhaps the outstanding example of this fact.</p> <p>This government may be sincere when it says that the era of centralisation is over but he who pays the piper still calls the tune. And this government has kept very tight control of funding. There are too many contradictions in saying that Whitehall does not know best and still keeping hold of every purse string. </p> <p>The Office of Civil Society will work with the voluntary sector to pilot more imaginative ways of denationalising the distribution of public funds.</p> <p>75% of all voluntary organisations have no paid staff. Applying for grants is particularly burdensome for these small platoons although a few hundred pounds might transform their work. By devolving funding packages to mediating groups we can limit the way that government money shackles the voluntary sector. Local churches seeking small grants, for example, are much more likely to work comfortably with the Salvation Army or Shaftesbury Society. Both are professional Christian charities with high accountability standards and yet are also able to stand up to the demands of government funders. </p> <p>Other possible reforms might involve allowing more money to follow the users of services - whether those services are daycare for the elderly or drug rehabilitation. Users - who know where the shoe pinches - could then discover more innovative and diverse services. Government officials are always going to be more comfortable with groups that approximate to their own way of doing things. They will understandably hesitate before funding new and, perhaps, unusual projects.</p> <p>Public funders are making progress in consulting communities about service provision. But patterns of consultation are patchy and sometimes rely on unrepresentative voices. The Office of Civil Society will research ways of routeing public money through communities so that consultation is replaced by real power. </p> <p>The NCVO's idea, for example, of setting up community endowments to fund projects identified by local people merits active consideration. It would certainly be consistent with the Conservative party's existing commitment to endow universities and museums. The OCS could research the use of charity vouchers and the use of tax credits to ensure money reaches charitable groups that most enjoy the confidence of people and communities.</p> <p>Charitable giving represents the best way of increasing independence. Levels of giving - particularly by companies - are much lower in Britain than, for example, the United States. Although the chancellor has made some welcome changes to encourage giving he has given with one hand, only to take with the other. We are currently considering proposals put to us by the voluntary sector and will make our tax announcements in coming weeks.</p> <p>We also want to help the whole culture of volunteering in Britain.</p> <p>The Scouts, the Football Association, the Duke of Edinburgh's award programme, Sunday schools and other countless community groups are all vital parts of our society and depend upon volunteers. Background checks on volunteers are an absolutely necessary protection for children and other vulnerable users of voluntary services. But requiring voluntary groups to pay for these checks is one stealth tax too far and Conservatives would not have imposed it. </p> <p>Until today this government was threatening to charge voluntary organisations \u00a310 for each occasion on which they have to check the credentials of people employed to work with children. They then heard last night that I was going to announce here that the next Conservative government would not levy any charge. By a strange coincidence, ministers suddenly announced that, despite everything they said before, they will not impose this charge. Don't ever think that the opposition can't do something for you.</p> <p>We don't crow. We welcome the u-turn. For Conservatives regard this as an unwarranted imposition on the voluntary sector - a sector which does so much to provide quality services at least as efficiently as the public sector could do. Of course, it is important that we now examine the small print of what the government is proposing. Too often these announcements unravel on close examination. </p> <p>We at least are clear. We will abolish these charges without hidden conditions or costs to the voluntary sector. The net cost - an average of \u00a33m for each of the government departments involved - will be borne from within the budgets of those departments.</p> <p>The Office of Civil Society will regularly consult volunteers and representative groups. Our Listening to Britain consultations have identified concern at the decline in volunteering amongst young people. Good citizenship is not something that you learn in a citizenship lesson or from a textbook. By spending time volunteering and helping local charities children are encouraged to understand their responsibilities to their neighbours and play a role in building stronger communities. We believe that children should be assisted by schools to take up volunteering opportunities in their local communities.</p> <p>At the heart of the teachings of the world's great religions and philosophies is the encouragement to love and care for a neighbour. The next Conservative government will be a friend of the good neighbour.</p> <p>In renewing civil society we will not preach - we will empower. We will not squash the aspirations of good neighbours. We will help to fulfil them.</p> <p>People want to give, but the tax system is too complex and volunteers are threatened with expensive background checks. Conservatives will create a tax system and a culture of volunteering that encourages generosity.</p> <p>Churches, synagogues and mosques want to do more in their communities, but their religious beliefs are the subject of scorn. Conservatives will end discrimination against faith and will welcome all religious people who wish to reclaim social responsibilities. </p> <p>Too many married couples face a tax system that ignores the commitments they have made. We will reform the tax system and introduce new support services for marriage.</p> <p>The interests and aspirations of families, faith communities, the voluntary sector and all good neighbours will be at the heart of the Conservatives' Common Sense Revolution.</p> <p>Conservatives will build a kinder, more united Britain by encouraging greater personal responsibility and responsibility for others as the foundation of civil society. Such a Britain must be underpinned by a dynamic economy. Government - through investment in schools, hospitals and social security - will still need to underwrite opportunity. But the rebuilding of communities and the healing of broken lives will most depend upon the vitality of our families, charities, places of worship and local schools.</p> <p>There is not a social problem that is not being tackled by one small platoon somewhere in Britain. Every minute of everyday one life is changed forever by the care of a parent, friend or good neighbour. That care represents the greatness of our country and Conservatives will be its friend and champion. </p>",

Today I want to talk about the principled partnership that the next Conservative government will build with you. A principled partnership that will give the voluntary sector a voice at the top of government. A principled partnership that will revolutionise the process of applying for grants. A principled partnership that will give charities new opportunities to run schools, regenerate disadvantaged communities and take development projects to every corner of the globe. Twenty years ago the first Conservative revolution began. Battered by regulations, taxes and inflation the enterprise of British people - which had once produced the world's most prosperous country - was exhausted. That first Conservative revolution proved that there were no shortcuts to prosperity. I want to extend the same Conservative principles to the creation of a more compassionate society. It is not enough to define the economic limits of government. We must be realistic about the state's ability to address social needs too. Just as wealth creation depends upon the energies of a free people, a good society depends upon the active compassion of free and independent families, neighbours and charities. Fifty years ago Beveridge recognised this when he said: \"A good society depends not on the state, but on the citizens, acting on motives of various kinds, some selfish, others unselfish, some narrow and material, others inspired by love of man and love of God. The happiness or unhappiness of the society in which we live depends upon ourselves as citizens, not on the instrument of political power which we call the state.\" The next Conservative government will improve our public services and protect social security but we will not stop there. The Common Sense Revolution will actively recognise civil society's role in building one nation of opportunity and security for all. The pensioner who is lonely, the child who has never seen his father or the teenager turning to drugs don't always need another government initiative or taskforce of the great and good. They are crying out for the care and attention of another human being. And every day millions of people do show compassion to a child, neighbour or stranger. Within families and communities people find friendship, identity, and belonging. Many of life's greatest obstacles - bereavement, sickness or unemployment - are overcome because of the personal support of a parent, spouse or friend. But many active citizens are frustrated by the environment created by government. Volunteers are faced with expensive background checks. Applying for government grants involves navigating a jungle of bureaucracy. Political correctness forces charities and faith communities to dilute their essential character. These barriers that separate good neighbours from people in need must come down. That is why I favour \"denationalising compassion\". And that is why the next Conservative government will get off the back of charities, volunteers and families. Often government fails the voluntary sector by failing to even consider its perspective. By establishing an Office of Civil Society reporting to a cabinet minister, the next Conservative government will change this. This office will be staffed by charities, faith communities and family groups. The \"good neighbours\" who give our country its strength and decency. It is the boldest initiative of its kind for a generation. I am announcing the office's first four tasks today. First, we must end the huge diversion of your time into form-filling and paperwork. We must end the master-and-servant relationship between government and grant applicants. The complexity and number of application forms represents an intolerable burden and disenfranchises the smallest and often most innovative charities and community groups. There is a growing danger that groups that get money are the best at hacking the system rather than those who are best at the work in hand. The whole process can demoralise the charity workers closest to a project's ethos. Complex form-filling betrays the instincts of government to micromanage - managing inputs and process - rather than delivering results. We will still hold charities accountable for results, but the introduction of one simple form across government departments - made up of a la carte sections covering only essential funding considerations - will demonstrate our trust in charities. Second, the office will help us to end the lottery of identifying sources of funding. Information about grant opportunities is not the property of the government - but the property of every interested citizen. Modern technology gives us an opportunity to establish a one-stop website which will record basic information about all public sector grant opportunities. I would prefer that groups like the NCVO, the Charities Aid Foundation and the National Centre for Volunteering should be funded to manage this service. They are in the best position to know how this website would best serve their members. This one-stop portal follows our proposal to establish a similar system - Aid Direct - for international development. Third, the office will coordinate efforts to encourage greater independent sector involvement in public services. It is unreasonable, for example, to expect voluntary groups - often starved of funding for core functions - to be immediately ready to embark on the process of applying to run schools, housing or employment projects. The office will coordinate investment in the capacity of voluntary groups and faith communities - where they are interested - to seize the new opportunities. By involving the voluntary sector in schooling, housing and urban regeneration, we will create more diverse provision - better suited to the variety of needs in today's Britain. In education, for example, we will empower the pioneering work of black-majority churches to deliver the highest quality supplementary education to their communities. The office will also help government departments to improve their understanding of voluntary groups by giving civil servants access to training on these same possibilities of greater cooperation with voluntary groups. This training will include specific efforts to encourage more engagement with faith communities. Fourth, the office will produce a regular review of its work. This review will cover progress made on the Compact between the government and the voluntary sector. It will record trends in volunteering, charitable giving and how policy changes have affected marriage, parents and the extended family. It will examine the extent to which faith communities have been fairly receiving grants. In short it will bring consideration of civil society into the heart of government. The vital responsibility of international development will epitomise the Conservative approach to helping our neighbour. Through television and cheap and fast international travel we are right to think of the people affected by the Indian earthquake as our neighbours and that we can do something to help them. In the last year the British people have reached out their hand to their neighbours in Mozambique, El Salvador and Gujarat. Some of Britain's development charities have been the fastest and most effective agents of emergency aid as well as the most committed to long-term development projects. I can announce today that the next Conservative government will restructure the budget of the Department for International Development and so double the percentage of our development expenditure that goes through non-governmental organisations. By making it much simpler for small charities to apply for DFID grants we will ensure that these innovative charities take a big share of this doubled support for charitable groups. In partnership with the NGO community we will establish a sophisticated website and call centre to match needs in the developing world with willing helpers in Britain. We will invest in technology to twin individuals, charities and faith communities with partners in the developing world. We will also send an extra 5,000 young people to serve abroad every year. We all have a part to play in helping our neighbour overseas. As we move towards the UN target of giving 0.7% of GNP to international development the next Conservative government will play its full part. That will involve working in a fuller and more principled partnership with international development charities. But however much we improve the voluntary sector's relationship with government we need to do much more to improve the sector's relationship with the rest of civil society. This is essential if we are to encourage a genuinely \"independent sector\". When a charity depends upon the state for its income it can lose touch with the community - in the same way that a subsidised business loses touch with its customers. This can lead to charities imitating the management style and ethos of government. The voluntary sector becomes the compelled sector. Compelled to change its character according to its paymasters' demands. Compelled to jump through bureaucratic hoops in response to changing compliance criteria. A charity that receives a large share of its income from private citizens will be more diverse and innovative. And it won't just receive money. Ideas, time, encouragement and prayers will follow. The love that characterises the hospice movement is perhaps the outstanding example of this fact. This government may be sincere when it says that the era of centralisation is over but he who pays the piper still calls the tune. And this government has kept very tight control of funding. There are too many contradictions in saying that Whitehall does not know best and still keeping hold of every purse string. The Office of Civil Society will work with the voluntary sector to pilot more imaginative ways of denationalising the distribution of public funds. 75% of all voluntary organisations have no paid staff. Applying for grants is particularly burdensome for these small platoons although a few hundred pounds might transform their work. By devolving funding packages to mediating groups we can limit the way that government money shackles the voluntary sector. Local churches seeking small grants, for example, are much more likely to work comfortably with the Salvation Army or Shaftesbury Society. Both are professional Christian charities with high accountability standards and yet are also able to stand up to the demands of government funders. Other possible reforms might involve allowing more money to follow the users of services - whether those services are daycare for the elderly or drug rehabilitation. Users - who know where the shoe pinches - could then discover more innovative and diverse services. Government officials are always going to be more comfortable with groups that approximate to their own way of doing things. They will understandably hesitate before funding new and, perhaps, unusual projects. Public funders are making progress in consulting communities about service provision. But patterns of consultation are patchy and sometimes rely on unrepresentative voices. The Office of Civil Society will research ways of routeing public money through communities so that consultation is replaced by real power. The NCVO's idea, for example, of setting up community endowments to fund projects identified by local people merits active consideration. It would certainly be consistent with the Conservative party's existing commitment to endow universities and museums. The OCS could research the use of charity vouchers and the use of tax credits to ensure money reaches charitable groups that most enjoy the confidence of people and communities. Charitable giving represents the best way of increasing independence. Levels of giving - particularly by companies - are much lower in Britain than, for example, the United States. Although the chancellor has made some welcome changes to encourage giving he has given with one hand, only to take with the other. We are currently considering proposals put to us by the voluntary sector and will make our tax announcements in coming weeks. We also want to help the whole culture of volunteering in Britain. The Scouts, the Football Association, the Duke of Edinburgh's award programme, Sunday schools and other countless community groups are all vital parts of our society and depend upon volunteers. Background checks on volunteers are an absolutely necessary protection for children and other vulnerable users of voluntary services. But requiring voluntary groups to pay for these checks is one stealth tax too far and Conservatives would not have imposed it. Until today this government was threatening to charge voluntary organisations \u00a310 for each occasion on which they have to check the credentials of people employed to work with children. They then heard last night that I was going to announce here that the next Conservative government would not levy any charge. By a strange coincidence, ministers suddenly announced that, despite everything they said before, they will not impose this charge. Don't ever think that the opposition can't do something for you. We don't crow. We welcome the u-turn. For Conservatives regard this as an unwarranted imposition on the voluntary sector - a sector which does so much to provide quality services at least as efficiently as the public sector could do. Of course, it is important that we now examine the small print of what the government is proposing. Too often these announcements unravel on close examination. We at least are clear. We will abolish these charges without hidden conditions or costs to the voluntary sector. The net cost - an average of \u00a33m for each of the government departments involved - will be borne from within the budgets of those departments. The Office of Civil Society will regularly consult volunteers and representative groups. Our Listening to Britain consultations have identified concern at the decline in volunteering amongst young people. Good citizenship is not something that you learn in a citizenship lesson or from a textbook. By spending time volunteering and helping local charities children are encouraged to understand their responsibilities to their neighbours and play a role in building stronger communities. We believe that children should be assisted by schools to take up volunteering opportunities in their local communities. At the heart of the teachings of the world's great religions and philosophies is the encouragement to love and care for a neighbour. The next Conservative government will be a friend of the good neighbour. In renewing civil society we will not preach - we will empower. We will not squash the aspirations of good neighbours. We will help to fulfil them. People want to give, but the tax system is too complex and volunteers are threatened with expensive background checks. Conservatives will create a tax system and a culture of volunteering that encourages generosity. Churches, synagogues and mosques want to do more in their communities, but their religious beliefs are the subject of scorn. Conservatives will end discrimination against faith and will welcome all religious people who wish to reclaim social responsibilities. Too many married couples face a tax system that ignores the commitments they have made. We will reform the tax system and introduce new support services for marriage. The interests and aspirations of families, faith communities, the voluntary sector and all good neighbours will be at the heart of the Conservatives' Common Sense Revolution. Conservatives will build a kinder, more united Britain by encouraging greater personal responsibility and responsibility for others as the foundation of civil society. Such a Britain must be underpinned by a dynamic economy. Government - through investment in schools, hospitals and social security - will still need to underwrite opportunity. But the rebuilding of communities and the healing of broken lives will most depend upon the vitality of our families, charities, places of worship and local schools. There is not a social problem that is not being tackled by one small platoon somewhere in Britain. Every minute of everyday one life is changed forever by the care of a parent, friend or good neighbour. That care represents the greatness of our country and Conservatives will be its friend and champion.",

      "body": "<p>We've been here before. In the early summer of 1996, the old schemer Shimon Perez was swept aside by the brash right winger Binyamin Netanyahu and the world held its breath.</p> <p>The peace process is doomed, said the commentators. The region risks a drift into war. Yasser Arafat will never be able to cut a deal with this new hard nut.</p> <p>That last bit was right, at any rate. But Netanyahu didn't destroy the peace process so much as sabotage it. His distaste for concessions had more to do with his obsessive clutch on political power, than with any visceral notions about the future relationship between Israel and the Palestinians.</p> <p>The same is broadly true of Ehud Barak, who swept into the prime minister's office in 1999. Just as Netanyahu instinctively distrusted the vision of a separate Palestinian state, set out in the Oslo accords of 1993, so Barak supported it with almost fanatical zeal.</p> <p>With all the impatience of a military man, the former army chief of staff launched an all-out negotiating assault, believing that if he could deliver the main prize of a final peace treaty, all Israel would fall at his feet.</p> <p>From an Israeli point of view, he went much too far, much too fast. From a Palestinian point of view, he offered much too little, much too late. Nerves on both sides were scraped raw as Bill Clinton urged them ever onward toward the holy grail of a final settlement.</p> <p>Last summer at Camp David, Clinton and Barak came tantalisingly close to getting Arafat's signature on a deal which would have given him his cherished state. Later, in what became known as \"Camp David plus\", Barak impulsively offered him even more - including, to the outrage of the Israeli right, control of much of East Jerusalem.</p> <p>It was that offer, more than anything else, which cost Barak the election. At the time it was made, the Palestinian territories were in flames.</p> <p>The eruption of the al-Aqsa intifada - sparked, ironically enough, by Sharon's swaggering insistence on visiting the al-Aqsa mosque - was to most Israelis a final proof that Arafat was using violence as a way of squeezing more and more concessions out of a prime minister mesmerised by the final settlement.</p> <p>And so, as in 1996, the electors have turned a negotiator, a compromiser, out of office and turned instead to a man who promises security without concessions, who loathes the Oslo accords, and who believes that the Palestinians must be dealt with from a position of strength.</p> <p>As the Guardian correspondent in Jerusalem in 1996, I witnessed at close quarters the sudden, dangerous loss of momentum in the peace process after Netanyahu took over.</p> <p>In the autumn of that year, frustration erupted in a brief but bloody shooting war which the Palestinians inevitably lost but which stamped, for the first time, serious doubts in Israeli minds about their own invincibility.</p> <p>Ariel Sharon shares those doubts. That, I believe, is what makes him so much more dangerous than Netanyahu. Sharon's perception of Israel is not one of regional superpower; a nuclear tipped military colossus.</p> <p>He believes his country to be a tiny embattled oasis of democracy, set in an ocean of Arab hostility. His speeches and writings are suffused with the notion that Israel must be ever prepared to defend itself against internal and external attack.</p> <p>The internal enemies, of course, are the Palestinians: the two million who live in the territories conquered in 1967 and the one million who live within Israel proper, alongside five million Jews.</p> <p>Sharon is aware of the national aspirations of both Palestinian groups. In his blunt military man's way, he has come up with a stark solution: Jordan is Palestine and Palestine is Jordan.</p> <p>The argument runs like this: the kingdom of Jordan was artificially carved out of the old Palestine by British colonial authorities, who gave it to the Hashemite dynasty of Saudi Arabia as a reward for services rendered in the first world war.</p> <p>Now a majority of its population are Palestinians from the west side of the River Jordan (expelled by Israel, though Sharon does not say so).</p> <p>So now the Palestinians have a state of their own, in a part of Palestine which rightfully should be part of the Jewish homeland as promised by the British.</p> <p>In their magnanimity, the Jews have accepted the smaller part of Palestine west of the Jordan (so the argument goes on). They have to reach an accommodation with the awkwardly large minority of Arabs who insist on staying on the same side of the river.</p> <p>So let the minority rule itself locally, but without any trappings of state and certainly without any military apparatus.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in their own defence, the Jews should be able to colonise those same Palestinian territories with a series of fortified settlements, to prevent the Palestinians from ever threatening the main Israeli population centres on the crowded coastal strip.</p> <p>Similarly, the teeming squalor of the Gaza Strip should be strategically sprinkled with Jewish settlements as a forward line of defence. Ditto the Jordan Valley. And the Golan Heights, seized from Syria in 1967, should be held in perpetuity to discourage Damascus from any future military adventures.</p> <p>On the issue which scuppered Barak, the future of Jerusalem, the Sharon line is perfectly simple: the city is ours. Always has been, always will be. All of it. Forever.</p> <p>Sharon's views, thus encapsulated, might seem brutal or even bizarre to outsiders. In Israel they are very widely shared and not just on the political right.</p> <p>Sharon's passionate attachment to the Eretz Israel - the Land given by God to the Jews - is deeply embedded in Israeli culture.</p> <p>The notion that Palestinians might also be passionately attached to the land, the land that was taken from them, tends to provoke puzzlement among ardent Israelis. \"They are Arabs, there are 21 Arab countries for them to choose from, but only one for us,\" they say.</p> <p>There is still, among eternal optimists, a feeling that only \"strong\" right wing leadership can deliver a viable peace settlement.</p> <p>Having defeated the centre-left liberals, the theory runs, Sharon will be able to hammer out an honourable deal with the Palestinians and sell that deal to the nationalist right.</p> <p>That, in my opinion based on nearly four years in Jerusalem, is balderdash.</p> <p>Sharon's vision of the future is simply incompatible with the central idea of the Oslo accords: a new partition of the Holy Land, based on mutual recognition and equal status.</p> <p>To the new prime minister, an independent Palestine west of the Jordan is anathema; an abominable threat to the Jewish state and therefore to Jews everywhere.</p> <p>Seven years and four months ago, Arafat, Peres and the late Yitzhak Rabin astonished the world by shaking hands on the White House lawn. I remember well the mingled moods of outrage and wonder which swept Jerusalem on that day.</p> <p>I know that today a similar elation will be gripping those elements in the city which never believed in compromise and which are now enthusiastically preparing for renewed confrontation.</p> <p><b>Graphic</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/graphic/0,5812,434653,00.html\">Election results</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b> <br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434600,00.html\">07.02.2001: End of road for humiliated Barak</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434608,00.html \">07.02.2001: Israel gives up on peace with Sharon victory</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434602,00.html \">07.02.2001: Comment: Israel's dark hour</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434655,00.html \">07.02.2001: Despair as usual for Palestinians</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434618,00.html \">07.02.2001: Sharon in his own words</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434659,00.html\">Read the full text of Sharon's victory speech</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,381501,00.html \">Timeline</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b> <br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7edef/0\">Talk to Guardian policy editor Jonathan Freedland, 3.30pm today</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/wto/flash/0,6189,380127,00.html\"> An interactive history of Israel</a></p> <p><b>Video </b><br> <a href=\" http://play.rbn.com/?url=ap/nynyt/g2demand/0206israel_sharon.rm&amp;proto=dual\"> Ariel Sharon's victory speech, from the New York Times</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0112goldenberg2.ra\">Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem: Israelis divided ahead of crucial election (2mins 35)</a></p> <p><b>Key players</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,433318,00.html\"> Ariel Sharon: from butcher to 'Lion' to Prime Minister of Israel</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,378609,00.html\">Ehud Barak: the main loser</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,381921,00.html\">Supreme test for 'Mr Palestine'</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"http://guardiancentury.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,6051,105109,00.html\"> 15.05.1948: Jewish state is born</a> <br> <a href=\"http://guardiancentury.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,6051,105125,00.html\"> 19.11.1948: Arthur Koestler: Israel, the native generation</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.info.gov.il/eng/min-pmo.htm\">Office of the Israeli Prime Minister</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.israel-mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH00pq0\">Peace process:reference documents in full</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.knesset.gov.il/knesset\">Israeli Knesset</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.4321.co.il/no\">Email Barak, Sharon and Arafat</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/\">Jerusalem Post</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.ptimes.com/\">Palestine Times</a><br></p> <p><b>Email</b><br><a href=\"MAILTO:DBROWN445@AOL.COM\">dbrown445@aol.com</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "We've been here before. In the early summer of 1996, the old schemer Shimon Perez was swept aside by the brash right winger Binyamin Netanyahu and the world held its breath. The peace process is doomed, said the commentators. The region risks a drift into war. Yasser Arafat will never be able to cut a deal with this new hard nut. That last bit was right, at any rate. But Netanyahu didn't destroy the peace process so much as sabotage it. His distaste for concessions had more to do with his obsessive clutch on political power, than with any visceral notions about the future relationship between Israel and the Palestinians. The same is broadly true of Ehud Barak, who swept into the prime minister's office in 1999. Just as Netanyahu instinctively distrusted the vision of a separate Palestinian state, set out in the Oslo accords of 1993, so Barak supported it with almost fanatical zeal. With all the impatience of a military man, the former army chief of staff launched an all-out negotiating assault, believing that if he could deliver the main prize of a final peace treaty, all Israel would fall at his feet. From an Israeli point of view, he went much too far, much too fast. From a Palestinian point of view, he offered much too little, much too late. Nerves on both sides were scraped raw as Bill Clinton urged them ever onward toward the holy grail of a final settlement. Last summer at Camp David, Clinton and Barak came tantalisingly close to getting Arafat's signature on a deal which would have given him his cherished state. Later, in what became known as \"Camp David plus\", Barak impulsively offered him even more - including, to the outrage of the Israeli right, control of much of East Jerusalem. It was that offer, more than anything else, which cost Barak the election. At the time it was made, the Palestinian territories were in flames. The eruption of the al-Aqsa intifada - sparked, ironically enough, by Sharon's swaggering insistence on visiting the al-Aqsa mosque - was to most Israelis a final proof that Arafat was using violence as a way of squeezing more and more concessions out of a prime minister mesmerised by the final settlement. And so, as in 1996, the electors have turned a negotiator, a compromiser, out of office and turned instead to a man who promises security without concessions, who loathes the Oslo accords, and who believes that the Palestinians must be dealt with from a position of strength. As the Guardian correspondent in Jerusalem in 1996, I witnessed at close quarters the sudden, dangerous loss of momentum in the peace process after Netanyahu took over. In the autumn of that year, frustration erupted in a brief but bloody shooting war which the Palestinians inevitably lost but which stamped, for the first time, serious doubts in Israeli minds about their own invincibility. Ariel Sharon shares those doubts. That, I believe, is what makes him so much more dangerous than Netanyahu. Sharon's perception of Israel is not one of regional superpower; a nuclear tipped military colossus. He believes his country to be a tiny embattled oasis of democracy, set in an ocean of Arab hostility. His speeches and writings are suffused with the notion that Israel must be ever prepared to defend itself against internal and external attack. The internal enemies, of course, are the Palestinians: the two million who live in the territories conquered in 1967 and the one million who live within Israel proper, alongside five million Jews. Sharon is aware of the national aspirations of both Palestinian groups. In his blunt military man's way, he has come up with a stark solution: Jordan is Palestine and Palestine is Jordan. The argument runs like this: the kingdom of Jordan was artificially carved out of the old Palestine by British colonial authorities, who gave it to the Hashemite dynasty of Saudi Arabia as a reward for services rendered in the first world war. Now a majority of its population are Palestinians from the west side of the River Jordan (expelled by Israel, though Sharon does not say so). So now the Palestinians have a state of their own, in a part of Palestine which rightfully should be part of the Jewish homeland as promised by the British. In their magnanimity, the Jews have accepted the smaller part of Palestine west of the Jordan (so the argument goes on). They have to reach an accommodation with the awkwardly large minority of Arabs who insist on staying on the same side of the river. So let the minority rule itself locally, but without any trappings of state and certainly without any military apparatus. Meanwhile, in their own defence, the Jews should be able to colonise those same Palestinian territories with a series of fortified settlements, to prevent the Palestinians from ever threatening the main Israeli population centres on the crowded coastal strip. Similarly, the teeming squalor of the Gaza Strip should be strategically sprinkled with Jewish settlements as a forward line of defence. Ditto the Jordan Valley. And the Golan Heights, seized from Syria in 1967, should be held in perpetuity to discourage Damascus from any future military adventures. On the issue which scuppered Barak, the future of Jerusalem, the Sharon line is perfectly simple: the city is ours. Always has been, always will be. All of it. Forever. Sharon's views, thus encapsulated, might seem brutal or even bizarre to outsiders. In Israel they are very widely shared and not just on the political right. Sharon's passionate attachment to the Eretz Israel - the Land given by God to the Jews - is deeply embedded in Israeli culture. The notion that Palestinians might also be passionately attached to the land, the land that was taken from them, tends to provoke puzzlement among ardent Israelis. \"They are Arabs, there are 21 Arab countries for them to choose from, but only one for us,\" they say. There is still, among eternal optimists, a feeling that only \"strong\" right wing leadership can deliver a viable peace settlement. Having defeated the centre-left liberals, the theory runs, Sharon will be able to hammer out an honourable deal with the Palestinians and sell that deal to the nationalist right. That, in my opinion based on nearly four years in Jerusalem, is balderdash. Sharon's vision of the future is simply incompatible with the central idea of the Oslo accords: a new partition of the Holy Land, based on mutual recognition and equal status. To the new prime minister, an independent Palestine west of the Jordan is anathema; an abominable threat to the Jewish state and therefore to Jews everywhere. Seven years and four months ago, Arafat, Peres and the late Yitzhak Rabin astonished the world by shaking hands on the White House lawn. I remember well the mingled moods of outrage and wonder which swept Jerusalem on that day. I know that today a similar elation will be gripping those elements in the city which never believed in compromise and which are now enthusiastically preparing for renewed confrontation.

Courtroom trauma Recent research by the NSPCC studied the experience of abused children from the point at which they disclosed abuse through to trial and beyond. The research, commissioned by the area criminal justice liaison committee for Portsmouth, Southampton, the Isle of Wight, Hampshire and Dorset, involved interviews with children, their carers and professionals involved. It found that abuse commonly triggered severe behavioural and emotional symptoms, many families having been torn apart and/or ostracised by their communities. Only just over half the children who needed therapy or counselling actually received it. Where children failed to get help, it was because there was no system to identify them, resources were in adequate or there was professional reluctance to use counselling for fear it would contaminate evidence. Many children had very negative recollections of their experience of the criminal justice system, with cross-examination the worst aspect because of distress felt as a result of accusations of lying. Distress was also caused by delays and inability to predict when and how evidence would be given, lack of accurate information and \"not guilty\" verdicts inadequately explained. For many children, the experience seemed to have delayed or even hindered recovery. As a result of the study, crown courts are establishing specialist child witness services with a remit extended to pre and post-trial support for child victims and families.",

      "body": "<p>Following a decade of peace talks with the Palestinians, Israel has elected Ariel Sharon, reviled for his role as a war-maker with Arabs, as its new prime minister. After just 21 months in government, Ehud Barak's attempts to find lasting peace with the Palestinians and Israel's Arab neighbours were rejected at the polls yesterday. With 99% of the vote counted, he received just 37.8% share while Mr Sharon gained 62.5%.</p> <p><b>Did Mr Sharon win or Mr Barak lose?</b><br> A bit of both. Thought to be unelectable until a few months ago, Mr Sharon was aided by Mr Barak's delicate position as the leader of a minority coalition government in the Knesset. Mr Barak pursued his manifesto by withdrawing troops from Lebanon and holding talks with Syria. But the right hammered him when he offered Palestinians shared sovereignty of Jerusalem and control of 95% of the West Bank - at the same time as the intifada was claiming Jewish lives. He then lost support from Arab Israelis, whose boycott of the election in protest at Mr Barak's decision to use troops to quell the intifada is reflected in the turnout of just 62% from an electorate of 4.5m - the lowest in history. For Mr Sharon, his core support came from the 1m Russian immigrants who live in Israel. A Russian was the first Israeli citizen killed by the intifada, and this group, credited with bringing Mr Barak to power in 1999, was unwilling to forgive him for failing to deliver peace.</p> <p><b>Why don't the Palestinians like Mr Sharon? </b><br>Due to his past exploits in the army and as defence secretary. In 1953, as a general in the army he led a massacre on Qibya, a Palestinian village, which left 69 villagers dead. In 1982, without explicitly telling prime minister Menachem Begin, Mr Sharon sent the Israeli army into Lebanon, leading to the massacre of more than 1,000 Palestinian refugees living in Beirut by pro-Israeli Lebanese militia. An Israeli report in 1983 found Mr Sharon indirectly responsible for the massacre and recommended that he never be allowed to hold the position of defence secretary again.</p> <p><b>What are Sharon's beliefs?</b><br> Towards the end of the election campaign, Mr Sharon's language softened from its previous hardline but he is still tough on Israeli security. Noting Jewish Israelis' lack of support for shared sovereignty of Jerusalem, Mr Sharon will not divide the holy city as he sees it as a betrayal of Israel's past. He recognises that a Palestinian state is inevitable, but he will not negotiate with Palestinians until the intifada has ended. While Mr Barak offered a greater share of the West Bank and Gaza to the Palestinians, Mr Sharon is adamant that he will not give them more land than they already control.</p> <p><b>What were the main points of his acceptance speech?</b><br> \"The government, under my leadership, will act to restore security to the citizens of Israel, and to achieve a genuine peace and stability in the area. Peace requires painful compromises by both sides. I call upon our Palestinian neighbours to cast off the path of violence and to return to the path of dialogue and solving the conflicts between us by peaceful means. A government, under my leadership, will act to achieve genuine political settlements that will preserve the existential and historic needs of Israel, which will be based on mutual respect and mutual security.\"</p> <p><b>How was the election result treated across the world?</b><br> With trepidation. The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, was noncommittal. He said: \"We respect the decision of the Israeli people and hope the peace process will continue.\" Left-wing Israelis also voiced concern. Yossi Beilin, the justice minister and senior negotiator, called the result Israel's biggest gamble. He said: \"I hope and pray that this gamble will not be a disaster and the peace process will continue,\" The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said: \"The Israeli people have made their choice and we will of course work with the person that they have chosen as prime minister. Mr Sharon may have won a very substantial victory. There is no doubting the fact that the majority of the people of Israel would like to see that peace settlement.\" In the US, president George Bush congratulated Sharon in a brief phone call and said Washington would work with him on peace. He also declared the US-Israeli relationship \"rock solid\".</p> <p><b>Will the peace process continue? </b><br> Possibly, but probably not in the short term. Mr Sharon has told the world he will suppress the intifada, so his actions during the infancy of his presidency will be crucial. Also, he does not accept the peace terms as set out in the 1993 Oslo accord, and would want a complete renegotiation. Nonetheless, any future peace deal secured with the backing of Mr Sharon has a far greater chance of success than any that Mr Barak might have brokered.</p> <p><b>What now for Mr Barak and the Israeli left? </b><br> When conceding defeat, Mr Barak also stepped down as the leader of the Labour party - although he told his supporters they had \"lost the battle but would win the war\". The Labour party now awaits a leadership contest to restore the party's support. Shimon Peres, Nobel peace prize winner, is the favourite to take over, although Avraham Burg, the former Knesset speaker, is another contender. In the meantime, the left will probably concentrate their efforts in the Knesset where Mr Sharon has 45 days to form another coalition government. If he fails to do this, parliamentary elections will be held.</p> <p><b>Graphic</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/graphic/0,5812,434653,00.html\">Election results</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434600,00.html\">07.02.2001: End of road for humiliated Barak</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434608,00.html\">07.02.2001: Israel gives up on peace with Sharon victory</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434602,00.html\">07.02.2001: Comment: Israel's dark hour</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434655,00.html\">07.02.2001: Despair as usual for Palestinians</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434618,00.html\">07.02.2001: Sharon in his own words</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434659,00.html\">Read the full text of Sharon's victory speech</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,381501,00.html\">Timeline</a><br></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7edef/0\">Talk to Guardian policy editor Jonathan Freedland, 3.30pm today</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/wto/flash/0,6189,380127,00.html\">An interactive history of Israel</a></p> <p><b>Video</b><br> <a href=\"http://play.rbn.com/?url=ap/nynyt/g2demand/0206israel_sharon.rm&amp;proto=dual\" target=\"_new\">Ariel Sharon's victory speech, from the New York Times</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0207goldenberg.ra\">Suzanne Goldenberg in Ramallah: reaction to the election (2mins 17) </a></p> <p><b>Key players</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,433318,00.html\">Ariel Sharon: from butcher to 'Lion' to Prime Minister of Israel</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,378609,00.html\">Ehud Barak: the main loser</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,381921,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Supreme test for 'Mr Palestine'</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"http://guardiancentury.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,6051,105109,00.html\" target=\"_new\">15.05.1948: Jewish state is born</a><br> <a href=\"http://guardiancentury.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,6051,105125,00.html\" target=\"_new\">19.11.1948, Arthur Koestler: Israel's the new generation</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.info.gov.il/eng/min-pmo.htm\" target=\"_new\">Office of the Israeli Prime Minister</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.israel-mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH00pq0\" target=\"_new\">Peace process: reference documents in full</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.knesset.gov.il/knesset\" target=\"_new\">Israeli Knesset</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.4321.co.il/no\" target=\"_new\">Email Barak, Sharon and Arafat</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.ptimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Palestine Times</a></p>",

Eight million viewers - 32% of the audience - stayed tuned to watch the drama on the wards of Holby City at 8.05pm. Meanwhile, 7.3 million viewers were hoping the Bill's DS McAllister would get caught out for sleeping with her informer on ITV at 8pm. Almost 8m tuned in at 9pm for Peak Practice. This was pitched against the concluding episode of BBC1's two-part psychological thriller Second Sight, which was watched by 5.1 million - a 21% share. BBC2 scored a hit at 9pm with the second of its three-part series Congo. The show pulled in 4.5 million viewers. BBC News at 10pm had 4.7 million viewers, compared with ITV News At Ten's 6.2 million. Most of the ITV viewers - 5.7 million - stayed tuned for ITV's morbidly engrossing Prime Suspect: Real Life at 10.20pm, about wife-killer Mitchell Quy. Boston Law, BBC1's 10.35pm real-life law series, pulled in just 2.4 million viewers. Channel 4's new three-programme series on gender-swapping, Boy Meets Girl, attracted 2 million viewers at 9pm. Channel 5 got its highest viewing figures of the evening at 9pm, when 1.9 million watched the Harrison Ford thriller Presumed Innocent. The movie was part of the channel's Murder Week.",

      "body": "<p>I don't blame Planet 3 Publishing for producing a magazine called Mad About Boys that is aimed at nine- to 12-year-old girls and which features boy pin-ups, love hints, fashion tips and agony aunt advice. But I do wish they hadn't bothered. It's another one of those things that the world could easily do without; that will probably be of short-term appeal to a narrowly targeted audience, perhaps make someone a bit of money, and basically add more junk to the world. Sort of like the Popstars kids (who, for a variety of reasons, should be called Made Up). The magazine is a commercially astute, morally messy publication, slickly targeted at those girls in the bumpy limbo land between toddlerdom and teenagehood. </p> <p>There has been the inevitable orchestrated outcry that Mad About Boys attempts to sexualise pre-teen girls prematurely. But in reality the kind of make-up tips and hairstyles it features are closer to kiddy face-painting than anything seedy, unless you have an evil mind that sees sexiness in a little girl anyway. </p> <p>We are in a world where clothing for a nine-year-old girl is size-bracketed as a \"young teenager\", and teen pop music is so biased towards pre-teens that a band like Westlife might as well be the missing link between the Tweenies and Coldplay. Pre-teen girls have left cuteness behind, and are heading as fast as they can towards the teenage funkiness that is all around them. And here is a magazine that tackily, predictably exploits this. It is difficult to see how Woolworths can ban this publication without also taking out of their shops the belly button-showing tops, little skirts and body accessories they sell for nine-year-olds and under. </p> <p>The magazine is scary for an adult to look at because it is a fluffy, commercialised representation of the fact that 10-year-old girls are naturally becoming aware of their femininity, and increasingly alert to the physical, mental and environmental differences between themselves and boys. It is also scary because all the boy pin-ups are groomed to within a grinning inch of their tidy lives; they seem blissfully unaware that such a magazine ultimately confirms that, in many ways, the future is female. These are weaker-sex pin-ups. </p> <p>Of course, it is not nice to see the word \"sex\" in a magazine for nine-year-olds, but that is because, as an adult, you do not want to believe that your nine-year-old daughter is already thinking about sex, or sexiness, however tentatively. The worst thing about Mad About Boys is that it brazenly hurls the secret new feelings of pre-teen girls, and their need to keep these feelings secret from their parents, right in our faces. It's not called Party! or Girl Fun. It's called Mad About Boys, even if we really think it should be Vaguely Curious About Boys. </p> <p>I am, perhaps naively, relying on the good taste of my nine-year-old daughter Madeleine not to go anywhere near a magazine with such a name. I am as sure as a dad can be about his daughter when I say that I think it will be a couple of years before she finds the boys featured in the magazine anything other than a bit creepy. Her own feelings about boys at the moment seem to be that she would rather be one than dress to impress one. For her, the magazine's suggestions on how to begin several decades of seduction will seem yucky. Planet 3 might consider launching a magazine called Tom Boy. </p> <p>But as we parents say more and more about our children: they grow up so fast. That is what is so unsettling about this magazine - not that it is making young girls grow up any faster, but that it is joining in with all those forces that are bringing to an overlit surface changes perhaps best left outside the commercial world. Maddy might flip any minute and become girly and flirty, arriving at the edges of a sexiness that previous generations might have suppressed but which was always there. </p> <p>My preference would be another new magazine that is aimed at the female tweenies: Sabrina's Secrets.

      "bodyText": "I don't blame Planet 3 Publishing for producing a magazine called Mad About Boys that is aimed at nine- to 12-year-old girls and which features boy pin-ups, love hints, fashion tips and agony aunt advice. But I do wish they hadn't bothered. It's another one of those things that the world could easily do without; that will probably be of short-term appeal to a narrowly targeted audience, perhaps make someone a bit of money, and basically add more junk to the world. Sort of like the Popstars kids (who, for a variety of reasons, should be called Made Up). The magazine is a commercially astute, morally messy publication, slickly targeted at those girls in the bumpy limbo land between toddlerdom and teenagehood. There has been the inevitable orchestrated outcry that Mad About Boys attempts to sexualise pre-teen girls prematurely. But in reality the kind of make-up tips and hairstyles it features are closer to kiddy face-painting than anything seedy, unless you have an evil mind that sees sexiness in a little girl anyway. We are in a world where clothing for a nine-year-old girl is size-bracketed as a \"young teenager\", and teen pop music is so biased towards pre-teens that a band like Westlife might as well be the missing link between the Tweenies and Coldplay. Pre-teen girls have left cuteness behind, and are heading as fast as they can towards the teenage funkiness that is all around them. And here is a magazine that tackily, predictably exploits this. It is difficult to see how Woolworths can ban this publication without also taking out of their shops the belly button-showing tops, little skirts and body accessories they sell for nine-year-olds and under. The magazine is scary for an adult to look at because it is a fluffy, commercialised representation of the fact that 10-year-old girls are naturally becoming aware of their femininity, and increasingly alert to the physical, mental and environmental differences between themselves and boys. It is also scary because all the boy pin-ups are groomed to within a grinning inch of their tidy lives; they seem blissfully unaware that such a magazine ultimately confirms that, in many ways, the future is female. These are weaker-sex pin-ups. Of course, it is not nice to see the word \"sex\" in a magazine for nine-year-olds, but that is because, as an adult, you do not want to believe that your nine-year-old daughter is already thinking about sex, or sexiness, however tentatively. The worst thing about Mad About Boys is that it brazenly hurls the secret new feelings of pre-teen girls, and their need to keep these feelings secret from their parents, right in our faces. It's not called Party! or Girl Fun. It's called Mad About Boys, even if we really think it should be Vaguely Curious About Boys. I am, perhaps naively, relying on the good taste of my nine-year-old daughter Madeleine not to go anywhere near a magazine with such a name. I am as sure as a dad can be about his daughter when I say that I think it will be a couple of years before she finds the boys featured in the magazine anything other than a bit creepy. Her own feelings about boys at the moment seem to be that she would rather be one than dress to impress one. For her, the magazine's suggestions on how to begin several decades of seduction will seem yucky. Planet 3 might consider launching a magazine called Tom Boy. But as we parents say more and more about our children: they grow up so fast. That is what is so unsettling about this magazine - not that it is making young girls grow up any faster, but that it is joining in with all those forces that are bringing to an overlit surface changes perhaps best left outside the commercial world. Maddy might flip any minute and become girly and flirty, arriving at the edges of a sexiness that previous generations might have suppressed but which was always there. My preference would be another new magazine that is aimed at the female tweenies: Sabrina's Secrets. It's based around the TV series Sabrina the Teenage Witch, and appears to pass teenage make-up and party secrets to nine-and 10-year-olds, but without unnerving sensitive adults by overtly dragging into view the boy thing. The free gift that comes with the first issue is a make-up box. The free gift with the first issue of Mad About Boys is an inflatable photo frame. I might be OK with Maddy having a copy of the magazine as long as the picture she puts in the frame is one of me. Because she is mad about dad, and not yet - not quite yet - mad about boys. I'm pretty sure about that.",

      "body": "<p>Forget those fuzzy ultrasound pictures of your baby as a foetus. Truthfully, you can only see its head - the rest is a two-dimensional blur of black-and-white blobs. When today's teenagers look through the family photo album, they will be ashamed of the poor photographic record of their life in the womb. These days, the fashionable foetus is having a spanking new 3D ultrasound picture that shows the fine detail of a cute face and body. There are reports of not only mothers but obstetricians crying with joy at the perfect pictures. Yes, all foetuses look alike, but with a bit of effort you can start arguing over whose side of the family those hamster cheeks and elfin ears come from. </p> <p>The latest in ultrasound technology is not widely available. Newspapers publicised some of the first pictures last week. The new device is, most importantly, a diagnostic tool to detect a range of foetal abnormalities such as cleft palate and spina bifida. But doctors have also suggested that this new technology can improve the ability of parents to bond with their growing baby. And who wouldn't want to improve bonding - that primitive love for your baby that makes you want to slap anyone who hurts its feelings or doesn't think it the most beautiful, most intelligent baby in the world? </p> <p>Most pregnant women have at least two ultrasound scans: a \"dating scan\" to establish how old the foetus is at around 12 weeks, and then a detailed scan at 20 weeks to detect specific abnormalities. Jane Bates, the superintendent sonographer at St James hospital in Leeds, believes that contrary to popular belief, bonding may not be a side-effect of these procedures. </p> <p>\"There is no evidence in the psychological literature that it does increase bonding,\"she says. \"Bonding happens whether or not you have an ultrasound. It's mother nature that does the bonding all by itself. When mum and dad see the baby on the scan they get excited about it and it's a wonderful experience, but that's not the definition of bonding.\" </p> <p>For Isobel Taylor, a literary editor whose son Joe is seven, the feeling on seeing her foetus on screen was one of incredulity: \"I couldn't believe what I could see. I had felt so ill, but had never associated my illness with the reality of having a baby. I could not believe that I would be able to grow a baby. And in some ways I didn't like it - after seeing him I felt I was never on my own.\" </p> <p>She doesn't think it helped with bonding. \"Even when I could see his elbows and hands, it didn't make me connect with him. It was unnerving. There was an overriding fear that I had this baby in there and I was going to have to get it out. Until you've got it in your arms, you don't engage with it as a baby.\" For men, however, who may find it even harder to connect with their baby-to-be during their partner's pregnancy, a scan (even the old-fashioned, low-res variety) often brings the reality home. \"It makes the little emotional thought that you're having a baby just that bit more tangible,\" says Rob Barlay, a recruitment consultant, whose daughter Katrina is 13 months old. \"I remember getting more excited as we saw scans which showed a recognisable human being.\" </p> <p>But did it help with bonding? \"It generated a greater feeling of reality and, therefore, love,\" he says. \"So maybe it was the start of some bonding process. I felt a stronger affinity to my child after I saw the scan.\" </p> <p>Clearly, though, there is a market for it: several clinics in London already offer \"foetal portraits\". But, according to David Howe, consultant in foeto-maternal medicine at the Princess Ann hospital in Southampton, it is the detail many parents love that makes it potentially useful - except that this usefulness may not be the positive experience that many parents expect. </p> <p>\"Its main benefit may be in parents being able to see and understand when something's wrong,\" he says. \"If their baby has a facial cleft [such as a cleft palate], this enhanced scan may make it slightly easier for us to pick up. And because parents will be able to see it, they be more prepared for what their baby will look like.\" </p> <p>But the scan can only do so much. If the foetus doesn't co-operate, then the picture won't be informative. \"At the moment it can take five to 10 minutes with these scans to get just the image of the face,\" says Howe. \"If the foetus has its nose pressed against the womb, then you can't see its face properly and you could still miss a facial cleft.\" </p> <p>Many parents, of course, don't expect their foetus to be anything other than perfect. Wary of this, some hospitals even call the 20-week scan - the favourite for cooing over the baby - the \"foetal-anomaly scan\" in order to warn parents that this isn't inevitably a jolly family event. </p> <p>\"There is a huge discrepancy between parents' and doctors' perceptions of what scanning is for,\" says Howe. \"We do provide information that tells parents they can decline to have a scan. Some people don't want to know if anything is wrong with their baby. But our uptake is about 98.9%. About 1-2% of these will be abnormal - more, if you count early pregnancies.\" </p> <p>Jane Bates says that it's only when parents have had an abnormal foetal scan that their attitude changes towards the procedure. </p> <p>\"It can be incredibly hard to tell women when something's wrong. We give them written information about the purpose of the scan before they come here, but for some reason it's hard for people to retain it - maybe women just expect their babies to be normal. Mums who have had problems tend to be more informed about what we're looking for on a scan. </p> <p>\"The scan may be a nice experience, but the NHS is not in the business of screening unless there is a clear benefit. The first reason for these scans is medical: to check the baby's heart is beating; that it is in the womb; that it is growing; and that the placenta is in the right place.\" </p> <p>Bates believes there is an argument for parents signing a consent form for the procedure to lend it seriousness. \"Some clinics do provide scans just for fun,\" she says. \"It just perpetuates the myth that this is a Warner Brothers experience.\"</p>",

They call her \"the baby whisperer\", and her knack for understanding the babies of the rich and famous is something to behold. Hand her a wailing infant with a household name, or let that infant wail down the phone, and within seconds she can tell you what he is really saying, and how to calm him down. </p> <p>A word to the wise, though: if you are thinking of hiring her, your first phone call should probably be to the bank. Tracy Hogg, Yorkshire-born nanny to the stars, does not come cheap. Her day rate is \u00a3700. A three-week stay could set you back \u00a310,000. </p> <p>But now we have read things about Hogg's past that make you wonder how she could have had the nerve to set herself up as a child expert. The story comes from her ex-husband, a former miner named Ray Fear, who talked to the tabloids earlier this week, to coincide with - or perhaps sabotage - the publication in Britain of her book, Secrets of the Baby Whisperer. </p> <p>In it, Hogg claims that she learned most of her magic from her grandmother, and the rest from working as a nurse with disabled children. However, Fear claims that she did little whispering with her own daughters. There was, allegedly, no breast-feeding: Hogg put both girls straight on the bottle and went straight back to work. Even when they were very small, she left their care to her mother and grandmother. Then, eight years ago, she and her second husband moved to California, leaving behind her daughters, then seven and 10. The latter, Sarah, now lives in Hollywood with her mother. The younger one, Sophie, will be joining them after her GCSEs. </p> <p>Hogg insists that leaving them was the right decision, and that she maintained a close relationship with the girls via school holidays and the internet. But Fear counters that the girls were distraught when their mother moved away. \"Sophie would say, 'Mummy is in America looking after all these babies and staying with them. Why isn't she doing it with me?'\" It is a question some of her clients may be asking, too. </p> <p>But is it fair to expect childcare experts to have perfect childcare records themselves? Before condemning Hogg, it is worth examining how her predecessors and peers have managed. Dr Spock, for example, was incapable of the sort of warm and permissive fathering he extolled in his books. \"He was very Victorian,\" one of his sons recalls. He was \"never a person who gave a hug. He couldn't kiss me. He never kissed me.\" Spock was, at least, aware of his shortcomings (not just as a parent but as a stepfather). He even admitted them in public. </p> <p>The same cannot be said of the father of all childcare experts, John-Jacques Rousseau. In Emile, the widest read manual of its time, he wrote passionately against swaddling and eloquently in defence of breastfeeding. But he left all five of his illegitimate children to the mercy of foundling hospitals where the infant mortality rate was often as high as 100%. </p> <p>Measure Hogg against such a standard, and she comes off looking like an earth goddess. According to Frank Furedi, a sociologist, it would be wrong to scapegoat her. \"We don't need to have a go at her for not being a perfect mother,\" says Furedi, author of the forthcoming Paranoid Parenting. \"This is an impossible burden on anybody.\" </p> <p>But the world would be a better place, he thinks, if we could give up on the myth of the perfect expert. In his book, Furedi challenges the idea that anyone \"can have an expertise on a very intimate relationship and generalise from that. It misses the fact that each relationship is unique\". You learn the most as a parent, he says, by spending time with children and the other parents at the school gate. This sort of learning is best because it is rooted in \"the specificity of experiences, and the tissue of organic relationships\". If you take your instruction from childcare experts, \"it short-circuits this process\". </p> <p>Sheila Kitzinger, whose name is often twinned with words like expert and guru, couldn't agree more. \"We are sitting ducks. Sometimes it's the baby who is telling us we are doing the wrong thing, crying all day long, telling us we're a bad mother.\" </p> <p>The real problem, she says, is that \"a lot of women who have babies are socially isolated. They were working in an office and now they are home. There isn't anyone they can talk to, and so often because there's so much competition to have the perfect baby, they can't tell anyone. And then the experts step in.\" </p> <p>Like Furedi, she does not believe they can presume to know best. Parents, she says, learn best from each other, by \"sharing what they've learned through experience and observation\". She tries to work within that tradition when she writes her books. \"What I'm trying to do is not talk to a woman,\" says Kitzinger, \"but talk with her. It's part of a discussion a sharing, an equal relationship, there are some things I know, some things she knows, and some things I'll never know. It isn't me dishing out the answers.\" </p> <p>But according to Deborah Jackson, author of the permissive classic Three in a Bed, many readers do prefer experts who play the part. She recalls a speech she gave a few years ago to a group of parents who were, in her view, becoming too cultish about the \"continuum concept\". (This is the theory that you should hold your child continuously for the first few years of life.) She knew it was going to be a hostile audience, so she left her children at home. The group was furious. </p> <p>\"I got hammered for not bringing the children, for not putting them on view,\" she recalls. \"They didn't just want me to parent perfectly, but parent perfectly in public.\" </p> <p>Her new book, Baby Wisdom, looks at the history of of child-rearing across the world. The idea is not to give advice, but to provide a context so that people can make their own informed and imaginative decisions. But Jackson has had to work hard to keep the publishers from using the word \"bible\" on the cover. She understands why it would make sense in marketing terms, and why first-time parents would warm to it. </p> <p>\"It's a terrifying experience,\" she agrees, \"and our culture doesn't prepare us for it. To get through it, you don't need an ordinary book, you need something spiritual. You need a bible.\" </p> <p>But how awful to wake up and find out you have been mistaken for a deity. \"What happens with many experts is that we end up deconstructing ourselves,\" Jackson points out. \"We stake a position and we end up backing down the rest of our lives, because we see people are leaning too severely on what we have said. So I say, 'Down with experts.' Let's admit there are no answers, and we are just having a discussion. The more flawed perspectives there are, the better.\" The trouble is - as Hogg may be learning to her cost - is that flawed perspectives don't sell books.</p>",

He couldn't kiss me. He never kissed me.\" Spock was, at least, aware of his shortcomings (not just as a parent but as a stepfather). He even admitted them in public. The same cannot be said of the father of all childcare experts, John-Jacques Rousseau. In Emile, the widest read manual of its time, he wrote passionately against swaddling and eloquently in defence of breastfeeding. But he left all five of his illegitimate children to the mercy of foundling hospitals where the infant mortality rate was often as high as 100%. Measure Hogg against such a standard, and she comes off looking like an earth goddess. According to Frank Furedi, a sociologist, it would be wrong to scapegoat her. \"We don't need to have a go at her for not being a perfect mother,\" says Furedi, author of the forthcoming Paranoid Parenting. \"This is an impossible burden on anybody.\" But the world would be a better place, he thinks, if we could give up on the myth of the perfect expert. In his book, Furedi challenges the idea that anyone \"can have an expertise on a very intimate relationship and generalise from that. It misses the fact that each relationship is unique\". You learn the most as a parent, he says, by spending time with children and the other parents at the school gate. This sort of learning is best because it is rooted in \"the specificity of experiences, and the tissue of organic relationships\". If you take your instruction from childcare experts, \"it short-circuits this process\". Sheila Kitzinger, whose name is often twinned with words like expert and guru, couldn't agree more. \"We are sitting ducks. Sometimes it's the baby who is telling us we are doing the wrong thing, crying all day long, telling us we're a bad mother.\" The real problem, she says, is that \"a lot of women who have babies are socially isolated. They were working in an office and now they are home. There isn't anyone they can talk to, and so often because there's so much competition to have the perfect baby, they can't tell anyone. And then the experts step in.\" Like Furedi, she does not believe they can presume to know best. Parents, she says, learn best from each other, by \"sharing what they've learned through experience and observation\". She tries to work within that tradition when she writes her books. \"What I'm trying to do is not talk to a woman,\" says Kitzinger, \"but talk with her. It's part of a discussion a sharing, an equal relationship, there are some things I know, some things she knows, and some things I'll never know. It isn't me dishing out the answers.\" But according to Deborah Jackson, author of the permissive classic Three in a Bed, many readers do prefer experts who play the part. She recalls a speech she gave a few years ago to a group of parents who were, in her view, becoming too cultish about the \"continuum concept\". (This is the theory that you should hold your child continuously for the first few years of life.) She knew it was going to be a hostile audience, so she left her children at home. The group was furious. \"I got hammered for not bringing the children, for not putting them on view,\" she recalls. \"They didn't just want me to parent perfectly, but parent perfectly in public.\" Her new book, Baby Wisdom, looks at the history of of child-rearing across the world. The idea is not to give advice, but to provide a context so that people can make their own informed and imaginative decisions. But Jackson has had to work hard to keep the publishers from using the word \"bible\" on the cover. She understands why it would make sense in marketing terms, and why first-time parents would warm to it. \"It's a terrifying experience,\" she agrees, \"and our culture doesn't prepare us for it. To get through it, you don't need an ordinary book, you need something spiritual. You need a bible.\" But how awful to wake up and find out you have been mistaken for a deity. \"What happens with many experts is that we end up deconstructing ourselves,\" Jackson points out. \"We stake a position and we end up backing down the rest of our lives, because we see people are leaning too severely on what we have said. So I say, 'Down with experts.' Let's admit there are no answers, and we are just having a discussion. The more flawed perspectives there are, the better.\" The trouble is - as Hogg may be learning to her cost - is that flawed perspectives don't sell books.",

Millbank election planners had hoped to use the forthcoming general election to test internet advertising in advance of a massive push for the election after next.

A Labour Party strategy insider said \"Labour had been planning a major online campaign for this coming election. \"They don't necessarily think it will be important this time round. \"However, they want to gain experience for the future when they expect online campaigns to be huge.\" But he added: \"This has all been put on hold following the problems experienced in the US.\" The e-voter survey showed online political advertising has some unintended and potentially negative consequences. The survey tracked 40,000 customers of Juno Online Services, a free internet service provider in the US that requires users to allow their surfing habits to be tracked. It covered the period from June to November 2000. Participants registered their sympathies before the study began. Their exposure to advertising was monitored and their voting behaviour was tracked after the election. Negative ads were not included in the survey. \"Pop-up\" ads, so-called because they automatically launch onto a user's screen and have to be clicked away, were mainly used by both parties for rebuttal and appeared to turn off voters. The survey showed 42% of undecided voters with Democratic sympathies, who saw no internet ads, ended up voting for Democratic candidate Al Gore.

News Corp recently announced a massive scaling back of its new media operations, including the termination of two joint ventures with online healthcare group WebMD. The WebMD write-off and the cost of other failed web investments were the main cause of a first-half operating loss of \u00a3200m. This figure compares with a profit of \u00a3576m for the same period in 1999. Analysts are threatening to downgrade shares in News Corp's BSkyB satellite TV station after it reported losses on its new media investments. Today's news will not improve sentiment. Elsewhere in Mr Murdoch's media empire, revenues were unchanged at \u00a34.8bn. This can be put down to falling advertising revenue at Mr Murdoch's Australian newspapers and at the Fox Broadcasting Company in the US. \"With economic growth slowing in several of our key markets, all of our divisions are working more diligently than ever to keep costs down while maximising revenues and profits,\" said Mr Murdoch, chairman of News Corp. A small silver lining was provided by News Corp's UK newspapers, which include The Sun and The Times. Advertising revenues increased by 8% and operating income surged by 19%. News Corp's considerable assets include the Star TV broadcast station in Asia, Twentieth Century Fox Television and Film, and HarperCollins publishing. Although today's results will disappoint the markets, investors will be more interested on news of News Corp's proposed merger with US satellite broadcaster DirecTV.

The members' wishes have driven us throughout this dispute. It is the members' action in the one-day and selective strikes that has pushed the employers to this new position.\"",

      "body": "<p>The government is drawing up plans to nationalise the lottery to avoid a repeat of last summer's fiasco over who should run the multi-billion pound game. </p> <p>In a move that will dismay the New Labour faithful, who regard nationalisation as a symbol of their discredited past, the culture secretary, Chris Smith, said that a formal review of the future of the lottery would consider taking it into public hands. </p> <p>Appearing before the Commons culture select committee, Mr Smith said: \"It has been said to me by quite a number of people that an option could perhaps be to see a lottery that is effectively owned by the nation through the government. </p> <p>\"Individual services for the running of the lottery would be contracted out to suppliers.\" </p> <p>Mr Smith's remarks, which could lead to the first nationalisation by a Labour government in more than two decades, were condemned last night by the Tories. </p> <p>Peter Ainsworth, the shadow culture secretary, said: \"It is difficult to imagine that the lottery would benefit from being owned by the state, which is not generally a good provider of modern services.

      "bodyText": "The government is drawing up plans to nationalise the lottery to avoid a repeat of last summer's fiasco over who should run the multi-billion pound game. In a move that will dismay the New Labour faithful, who regard nationalisation as a symbol of their discredited past, the culture secretary, Chris Smith, said that a formal review of the future of the lottery would consider taking it into public hands. Appearing before the Commons culture select committee, Mr Smith said: \"It has been said to me by quite a number of people that an option could perhaps be to see a lottery that is effectively owned by the nation through the government. \"Individual services for the running of the lottery would be contracted out to suppliers.\" Mr Smith's remarks, which could lead to the first nationalisation by a Labour government in more than two decades, were condemned last night by the Tories. Peter Ainsworth, the shadow culture secretary, said: \"It is difficult to imagine that the lottery would benefit from being owned by the state, which is not generally a good provider of modern services. This is a kneejerk response to the farce of last year and would help Labour's efforts to control the lottery.\" Mr Smith made his remarks as he faced intense questions from MPs over the events of last summer when Sir Richard Branson was initially favoured to take over the lottery. After a lengthy review, involving a court case, Camelot's licence was renewed for another seven years. Gerald Kaufman, the veteran Labour chairman of the select committee, said he saw no problem with government-run lotteries after visiting the United States, where two-thirds of lotteries are run by state authorities. \"Here we have a Labour government that is less socialist than republicans in the US,\" Mr Kaufman said.

This found companies such as Vodafone, BT Cellnet, Orange and One2One were making too much profit from a fully competitive market. \"UK mobile prices overall compare favourably to the rest of Europe and they continue to fall. \"However, there is evidence prices could be lower still,\" said David Edmonds, director general of Oftel. He added prices for international calls and for calls between rival mobile networks were not coming down compared with the cost of other services. \"Oftel will carry out further research into companies' pricing and profitability to assess if any of the operators are setting prices too high. \"We will monitor prices for services such as international roaming and for calls between different mobile networks,\" Mr Edmonds said. Despite finding mobile prices have fallen by 24% since January 1999, Oftel is prepared impose regulations on the market leaders to prevent anti-competitive behaviour. Any action against mobile call charges will be a blow to the UK's leading wireless operators. They shelled out a staggering \u00a322.5bn for next generation UK mobile phone licences last year and will need all the revenues they can get to pay for the franchises. These fears hit Vodafone's share price in early trading. The world's largest mobile phone company fell 2.9%, with BT tumbling 5.3% despite a recent strong run.",

BSkyB announced it had crashed through the all-important 5m subscriber barrier but its decision to subsidise subscribers continued to eat into the bottom line. The UK's largest satellite and digital broadcaster has been burning cash in the chase for customers and the trend was underlined in this morning's first-half results. BSkyB's all-important digital subscriber total climbed from 4m in September last year to 4.66m in December, taking the number of analogue and digital subscribers to just over 5m. The digital figures receive such close attention because digital broadcasting is widely seen as the future of TV. Any company ahead at this stage is seen as well set for the future. BSkyB's nearest rival is Carlton and Granada's ONdigital, with 1m subscribers. \"We are continuing to innovate with the launch of interactive services that will increase our revenues and maintain low churn. \"Sky customers now benefit from the world's most developed interactive television service,\" said Tony Ball, chief executive of BSkyB. However, a \u00a325m write-off against several unnamed BSkyB new media investments - and the cost of subsidising subscribers with lucrative offers - resulted in first-half losses of \u00a3112m. This is significant increase from the \u00a361.5m registered in 1999. Although analysts give lower priority to the pre-tax numbers, they will be concerned at the lack of movement in churn figures. The churn level, or the amount of customers who turn to a different service, stayed at 9.8% between July and December last year. It was hoped the rate would decrease to as much as 6.5%, although ONdigital's churn often clips 20%. The market reaction to BSkyB's figures was muted in early trading, as the shares rose 1.8% to 1120p. However, if BSkyB chairman Rupert Murdoch ties up the acquisition of US satellite broadcaster DirecTV, BSkyB's shares should expect a boost. Once the DirecTV deal is completed, BSkyB will be folded into Mr Murdoch's Sky Global Networks satellite TV company. Sky Global will then float in the biggest media share offering all time.",

Thousands, some with sickles and knives, besieged the local legislature of Mr Wahid's home province of east Java, where he is revered not only as the nation's leader but also as a Muslim cleric.

However, Mr Wahid was granted breathing space by vice-president Megawati Sukarnoputri who opposed such moves. Support from Mrs Megawati - whose party controls the largest slice of votes in parliament - is crucial to Mr Wahid. Although highly critical of Mr Wahid, Golkar is also opposed to attempts to accelerate his impeachment, as are the armed forces, which retain 38 seats in the 500-member parliament. All three groups say action against the president must be carried out strictly in accordance with the constitution.

One can scarcely imagine a more suitable person to drink it.</p> <p>Having won a landslide victory in what, for many voters, was a stay-away election, Mr Sharon now faces all the problems that dogged Mr Barak - and more.</p> <p>He now has to form a government without a majority (his party, the Likud, holds only 19 seats in the 120-seat Knesset) and, as usual in Israel's unmanageable parliamentary system, that will require alliances with odd bedfellows.</p> <p>Any hopes that Mr Sharon held of forming a government of national unity - with Mr Barak as defence minister - were dashed last night by Mr Barak's announcement that he is resigning as leader of the Labour party and as a member of parliament.</p> <p>Mr Sharon's immediate problem will be to win parliamentary approval for the national budget by March 31. If he gets past that hurdle, he may soldier on by avoiding meaningful attempts at legislation until parliament rises for the summer recess early in July, resuming again in October.</p> <p>Alternatively, Mr Sharon could call an early general election (the next one is not due until November 2003), but there is no certainty that it would resolve the chaos in the Knesset. Mr Sharon's sweeping victory in the prime ministerial election was as much a protest against Mr Barak's failure as anything else and does not necessarily reflect the way votes would divide in a contest among Israel's numerous political parties.</p> <p>Internally then, Mr Sharon faces all the same difficulties as Mr Barak, and analysts' views of his life expectancy as prime minister range from a few weeks to a couple of years.</p> <p>But internationally, Mr Sharon, with his links to some of the most unsavoury episodes in Israeli history, will face difficulties that Mr Barak never experienced. There will, inevitably, be calls from some quarters to have him arrested and put on trial - just as the Americans are hoping to do with Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia - though it's unlikely to happen.</p> <p>Mr Barak's image - at least initially - as a smiling peacemaker led to his lionisation in the west. Democrats in the US and centre-left governments in Europe felt an affinity with the Israeli Labour leader that, in the view of many Palestinians, was totally misplaced.</p> <p>This, according to the PLO, had become one of the major bugbears of the peace process over the last couple of years: they were constantly urged to make concessions and help the nice Mr Barak, on that grounds that if they did not, someone a lot nastier would come along and take his place.</p> <p>That, up to a point, is what has now happened. The Palestinians didn't concede (or surrender, as they see it) and now Mr Nasty is in charge. But the reality is a little more complex. Over the last four months, since the start of the intifada, Mr Barak has been trying very hard to look like Mr Sharon, while Mr Sharon, in turn, spent the election campaign trying to look like Mr Barak. It is even possible that Sharon he will grit his teeth and continue the Barak impersonations a little longer.</p> <p>This has led many Arabs (not just Palestinians) to argue - despite their qualms about Mr Sharon's background - that having him as Israel's leader will not necessarily make things worse.</p> <p>Some even suggest it will be beneficial, forcing western governments to be less sympathetic and more demanding towards Israel. Afif Safieh, the Palestinian representative in London, is one of them. \"Sharon in power will damage Israel's relations with the United States and Europe, and embarrass Jewish communities in the diaspora,\" he said yesterday.</p> <p>Regardless of what differentiates Messrs Barak and Sharon as leaders, there is, on the more fundamental issue of the peace process, a real choice that Israelis will one day have to make: is it to be peace through security or security through peace?</p> <p>Both options recognise that peace and Israel's security are inextricably linked, but there the similarities end. Security through peace means making a comprehensive deal with the Palestinians - granting them a viable state, making concessions over Jerusalem, and so on - in order to achieve longterm security of a kind that could be maintained at low cost, without keeping Israel on a war footing.</p> <p>That goal can only be reached by offering terms which the Palestinians can be persuaded to accept as reasonable, not by browbeating them into submission. The difficulty with this is that it requires more concessions (though perhaps not many more) than Israeli leaders have yet been prepared to make.</p> <p>Mr Barak did, at times, lean towards the security-through-peace approach - though he never quite managed to get there. The obstacle, on the Israeli side, is that the last few steps - in some cases on cherished issues of principle - seem too unpalatable for the fragmented political system to bear.</p> <p>Mr Sharon, on the other hand, epitomises the peace-through-security view. What this means in practice is not so much peace as pacification: take it slowly, make interim agreements which give away as little as possible and maximise Israeli control over Palestinian affairs.</p> <p>Over time, so the theory goes, the Palestinians will become exhausted and settle for next to nothing. It might work, but the history of liberation struggles elsewhere suggests it will not. All it is likely to do is build up resentment among future generations of Arabs, making Israel's security more difficult and costly, in lives and equipment, to maintain.</p> <p>Of course, Mr Sharon may not get his way. An optimistic view suggests that the kind of constraints that hampered Mr Barak will also temper the more extreme elements of Sharonism.</p> <p>There is, too, a feeling among some analysts that Ariel Sharon's election victory could prove to be the last gasp of an old warhorse - and everything he represents - before the Israeli public decide that enough is enough and bring their political system to its senses.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:brian.whitaker@theguardian.com\"> brian.whitaker@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/0,2759,377264,00.html\">Israel &amp; the Middle East</a><br></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28brian+whitaker%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=brian+whitaker&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Brian Whitaker</a></p> <p><b>Graphic</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/graphic/0,5812,434653,00.html\">Election results</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434707,00.html\">07.02.2001: World offers Sharon a wary welcome</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434655,00.html\">07.02.2001, comment: Despair as usual for Palestinians</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434709,00.html\">07.02.2001: What the Israeli papers say</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434600,00.html\">07.02.2001: End of road for humiliated Barak</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434608,00.html  \">07.02.2001: Israel gives up on peace with Sharon victory</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434602,00.html  \">07.02.2001: Comment: Israel's dark hour</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434655,00.html  \">07.02.2001: Despair as usual for Palestinians</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434618,00.html  \">07.02.2001: Sharon in his own words</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434659,00.html\">Read the full text of Sharon's victory speech</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,381501,00.html  \">Timeline</a><br></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7edef/0\">Talk to Guardian policy editor Jonathan Freedland, 3.30pm today</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/wto/flash/0,6189,380127,00.html\">An interactive history of Israel</a></p> <p><b>Video</b><br> <a href=\"  http://play.rbn.com/?url=ap/nynyt/g2demand/0206israel_sharon.rm&amp;proto=dual\" target=\"_new\">Ariel Sharon's victory speech, from the New York Times</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0206goldenberg.ra\">Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem: 'Barak promised peace and delivered an uprising' (2mins 53)</a><br><a href=\"  http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0112goldenberg2.ra  \">Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem: Israelis divided ahead of crucial election (2mins 35)</a></p> <p><b>Key players</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,433318,00.html\">Ariel Sharon: from butcher to 'Lion' to Prime Minister of Israel</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,378609,00.html\">Ehud Barak: the main loser</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,381921,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Supreme test for 'Mr Palestine'</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"  http://guardiancentury.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,6051,105109,00.html\" target=\"_new\">15.05.1948: Jewish state is born</a><br> <a href=\"  http://guardiancentury.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,6051,105125,00.html\" target=\"_new\">19.11.1948, Arthur Koestler: Israel's the new generation</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.info.gov.il/eng/min-pmo.htm\" target=\"_new\">Office of the Israeli Prime Minister</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.israel-mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH00pq0\" target=\"_new\">Peace process: reference documents in full</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.knesset.gov.il/knesset\" target=\"_new\">Israeli Knesset</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.4321.co.il/no\" target=\"_new\">Email Barak, Sharon and Arafat</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.jpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a><br> <a href=\"  http://www.ptimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Palestine Times</a></p>",

If he gets past that hurdle, he may soldier on by avoiding meaningful attempts at legislation until parliament rises for the summer recess early in July, resuming again in October. Alternatively, Mr Sharon could call an early general election (the next one is not due until November 2003), but there is no certainty that it would resolve the chaos in the Knesset. Mr Sharon's sweeping victory in the prime ministerial election was as much a protest against Mr Barak's failure as anything else and does not necessarily reflect the way votes would divide in a contest among Israel's numerous political parties. Internally then, Mr Sharon faces all the same difficulties as Mr Barak, and analysts' views of his life expectancy as prime minister range from a few weeks to a couple of years. But internationally, Mr Sharon, with his links to some of the most unsavoury episodes in Israeli history, will face difficulties that Mr Barak never experienced. There will, inevitably, be calls from some quarters to have him arrested and put on trial - just as the Americans are hoping to do with Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia - though it's unlikely to happen. Mr Barak's image - at least initially - as a smiling peacemaker led to his lionisation in the west. Democrats in the US and centre-left governments in Europe felt an affinity with the Israeli Labour leader that, in the view of many Palestinians, was totally misplaced. This, according to the PLO, had become one of the major bugbears of the peace process over the last couple of years: they were constantly urged to make concessions and help the nice Mr Barak, on that grounds that if they did not, someone a lot nastier would come along and take his place. That, up to a point, is what has now happened. The Palestinians didn't concede (or surrender, as they see it) and now Mr Nasty is in charge. But the reality is a little more complex. Over the last four months, since the start of the intifada, Mr Barak has been trying very hard to look like Mr Sharon, while Mr Sharon, in turn, spent the election campaign trying to look like Mr Barak. It is even possible that Sharon he will grit his teeth and continue the Barak impersonations a little longer. This has led many Arabs (not just Palestinians) to argue - despite their qualms about Mr Sharon's background - that having him as Israel's leader will not necessarily make things worse. Some even suggest it will be beneficial, forcing western governments to be less sympathetic and more demanding towards Israel. Afif Safieh, the Palestinian representative in London, is one of them. \"Sharon in power will damage Israel's relations with the United States and Europe, and embarrass Jewish communities in the diaspora,\" he said yesterday. Regardless of what differentiates Messrs Barak and Sharon as leaders, there is, on the more fundamental issue of the peace process, a real choice that Israelis will one day have to make: is it to be peace through security or security through peace? Both options recognise that peace and Israel's security are inextricably linked, but there the similarities end. Security through peace means making a comprehensive deal with the Palestinians - granting them a viable state, making concessions over Jerusalem, and so on - in order to achieve longterm security of a kind that could be maintained at low cost, without keeping Israel on a war footing. That goal can only be reached by offering terms which the Palestinians can be persuaded to accept as reasonable, not by browbeating them into submission. The difficulty with this is that it requires more concessions (though perhaps not many more) than Israeli leaders have yet been prepared to make. Mr Barak did, at times, lean towards the security-through-peace approach - though he never quite managed to get there. The obstacle, on the Israeli side, is that the last few steps - in some cases on cherished issues of principle - seem too unpalatable for the fragmented political system to bear. Mr Sharon, on the other hand, epitomises the peace-through-security view. What this means in practice is not so much peace as pacification: take it slowly, make interim agreements which give away as little as possible and maximise Israeli control over Palestinian affairs. Over time, so the theory goes, the Palestinians will become exhausted and settle for next to nothing. It might work, but the history of liberation struggles elsewhere suggests it will not. All it is likely to do is build up resentment among future generations of Arabs, making Israel's security more difficult and costly, in lives and equipment, to maintain. Of course, Mr Sharon may not get his way. An optimistic view suggests that the kind of constraints that hampered Mr Barak will also temper the more extreme elements of Sharonism. There is, too, a feeling among some analysts that Ariel Sharon's election victory could prove to be the last gasp of an old warhorse - and everything he represents - before the Israeli public decide that enough is enough and bring their political system to its senses.

      "bodyText": "At least one \"ordinary\" person will be at the star-studded Press Complaints Commission party tonight. Mingling with the stars will be one, slightly less famous person whom William will be particularly keen to meet. \"Accrington Boy\" is the young man who in 1995 inadvertently boosted the teenage prince's chances of privacy during his school days. Christopher Livesey was 15 when his mother made a complaint against her local newspaper in Accrington, Lancashire. Mr Livesey had been questioned by a journalist in breach of the PCC's code of conduct, which says children must be 16 or over to be interviewed. Mr Livesey was linked to Prince William by the PCC's chairman Lord Wakeham. In a speech to newspaper editors, Lord Wakeham said: \"What goes for a child in Accrington goes for a child in Eton.\" William and his younger brother Harry were largely left alone at school by the media. Mr Livesey is now a 21-year-old graphics student at Leeds Metropolitan University. He said today he was \"thrilled\" at being invited to the party, which is to celebrate the success of self-regulation in the industry. He said: \"It was my mum who made the complaint but when Lord Wakeham made that speech it was unreal. \"I was watching TV and I found myself suddenly known as 'Accrington Boy'. \"I am proud my case was used to protect the prince while at Eton. I'm really looking forward to meeting him.\" Many of the celebrities and politicians at the party are ones who have made complaints through the PCC. Many of the other guests are Fleet Street editors against whom their grievances were upheld. The Prime Minister, himself a successful complainant, today sent his \"best wishes\" to the PCC but added that it had \"proved impossible\" for him to attend the party. In a letter to Lord Wakeham, he said: \"It must be right that you have found time to celebrate this milestone. \"I know how hard the PCC, under your chairmanship and that of your predecessor, have worked at trying to strike the right balance between the sometimes competing but important demands of the freedom of the press and the need to treat fairly those who find themselves in the news.\" Mr Blair added: \"I believe it is a measure of the PCC's growing success over the last decade that there is increasing confidence and support for your efforts from both the press and the public.\" Lord Wakeham said today he hoped Prince William's privacy would be respected during his university years. \"When he went to Eton I asked that he should be left alone and, by and large, the press respected that. \"I anticipate they will do the same when he is at university,\" he said. \"I jolly well hope so, because it simply is not reasonable for a young man to go to university and not have a chance to pursue his university career. \"He will make himself available from time to time and I think the press appreciate that. \"But the deal is they must leave him alone the rest of the time,\" he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \"If the editors refuse to deal and publish photographs taken by the paparazzi, the paparazzi will find exactly the same as they found at Eton - there was no market for it, and therefore they disappeared. \"As long as the editors stick to the code, then we will be all right. \"I think the editors have every intention of sticking to the code.\" On another issue - the naming and shaming of paedophiles - Lord Wakeham said the PCC was talking to editors and probation officers to see whether guidelines should be issued. \"This consultation is ongoing and it is getting towards the end. \"I hope we will be able to say something in the fairly near future.\"",

      "body": "<p>World leaders today reacted with a mixture of caution and outrage to the election of hawkish Israeli rightwinger Ariel Sharon as prime minister.</p> <p>The warmest welcome came from the US president, <b> George Bush </b>, who immediately offered congratulations and a commitment to keeping US-Israeli relations \"rock solid\".</p> <p>\"The president told prime minister-elect Sharon he looked forward to working with him, especially with regard to advancing peace and stability in the region,\" said the statement, released by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.</p> <p>Speaking at a victory rally in Jerusalem yesterday, Mr Sharon said Mr Bush had \"told me about the close cooperation they wanted to have with the government I will be heading\".</p> <p>\"We shall act to deepen our special relations with our great friend and ally, the United States,\" Mr Sharon said. \"And we shall strengthen the ties between Israel and the nations of the world.\"</p> <p>Addressing his tearful supporters, the ousted prime minister, <b>Ehud Barak</b> said that he may have been \"ahead of his time\" in pushing Israelis and Palestinians toward a final peace accord before they were ready. \"Perhaps the public is not ready to accept the painful truth we have revealed to it,\" he said. \"On the other side, the Palestinian side is not yet sufficiently mature to take decisions and confront their painful reality. Violence has become the refuge for desperate people.\"</p> <p>The Palestinian leader , <b>Yasser Arafat </b>, was non-committal in his response to Mr Sharon's victory. \"We respect the Israeli people's choice and we hope the peace process will continue,\" Nabil Abourdeneh, a top aide to Mr Arafat, quoted him as saying.</p> <p>However, Palestinian negotiator <b>Saeb Erekat</b> warned that Sharon's hardline views were a \"recipe for war\", and the Palestinian information minister, <b>Yasser Abed Rabbo</b>, called Sharon's election \"the most foolish event in Israel's history\".</p> <p>Syrian media echoed the feelings of many in the Arab world by immediately condemning both the Israeli electorate and Mr Sharon.</p> <p>\"The victory of the bloody terrorist and war criminal Sharon as head of the Israeli government is a clear message by the Zionist entity to Arabs amounting to an official declaration of war,\" al-Baath, organ of the ruling Baath Party, said. \"By choosing Sharon the Israelis chose escalation, terrorism and aggression.

      "bodyText": "World leaders today reacted with a mixture of caution and outrage to the election of hawkish Israeli rightwinger Ariel Sharon as prime minister. The warmest welcome came from the US president, George Bush , who immediately offered congratulations and a commitment to keeping US-Israeli relations \"rock solid\". \"The president told prime minister-elect Sharon he looked forward to working with him, especially with regard to advancing peace and stability in the region,\" said the statement, released by White House spokesman Ari Fleischer. Speaking at a victory rally in Jerusalem yesterday, Mr Sharon said Mr Bush had \"told me about the close cooperation they wanted to have with the government I will be heading\". \"We shall act to deepen our special relations with our great friend and ally, the United States,\" Mr Sharon said. \"And we shall strengthen the ties between Israel and the nations of the world.\" Addressing his tearful supporters, the ousted prime minister, Ehud Barak said that he may have been \"ahead of his time\" in pushing Israelis and Palestinians toward a final peace accord before they were ready. \"Perhaps the public is not ready to accept the painful truth we have revealed to it,\" he said. \"On the other side, the Palestinian side is not yet sufficiently mature to take decisions and confront their painful reality. Violence has become the refuge for desperate people.\" The Palestinian leader , Yasser Arafat , was non-committal in his response to Mr Sharon's victory. \"We respect the Israeli people's choice and we hope the peace process will continue,\" Nabil Abourdeneh, a top aide to Mr Arafat, quoted him as saying. However, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat warned that Sharon's hardline views were a \"recipe for war\", and the Palestinian information minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, called Sharon's election \"the most foolish event in Israel's history\". Syrian media echoed the feelings of many in the Arab world by immediately condemning both the Israeli electorate and Mr Sharon. \"The victory of the bloody terrorist and war criminal Sharon as head of the Israeli government is a clear message by the Zionist entity to Arabs amounting to an official declaration of war,\" al-Baath, organ of the ruling Baath Party, said. \"By choosing Sharon the Israelis chose escalation, terrorism and aggression. They cut their final links with the peace process and drove the region into a new cycle of violence.\" The Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, said of the election: \"We will wait and see what Sharon will do. Will it be a policy of peace or one of suppression?\" European leaders worded their statements carefully, not wanting to upset the Israelis, the Palestinians or the Arab world at large on a day when tensions are high over the election result. The British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said continued pursuit of a peace agreement was in the best interests of the Israeli people and the international community. \"The Israeli people have made their choice and we will of course work with the person they have chosen as prime minister. And I hope that he will be willing to work with us and the international community to take forward the peace process,\" he said. Within Israel, Labour party faithful assessed the damage done to the party by Mr Barak's defeat. \"There's no doubt we suffered a terrible knockout yesterday,\" said Labour's parliamentary speaker Avraham Burg, who was the first to announce his candidacy to succeed Mr Barak as party leader. \"Without doubt, from the moment Ehud Barak resigned from the leadership of the Labour Party, the contest began and I will be one of the candidates,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "At the front of Only the Wicked, the latest LA-noir novel from writer Gary Phillips, there is a bleak, quoted paragraph: \"Mainstream America is counting on you to 'draw your sword' and fight for them. \"These people have precious little time and resources to battle misguided Cinderella attitudes: the fringe propaganda of the homosexual coalition; the feminists who preach that it is a divine duty for women to hate men; blacks who raise a militant fist with one hand while they seek preference with the other; New Age apologists for juvenile crime who see roving gangs as a means to only the merchandising of violence as a form of entertainment for impressionable minds; and the gun bans as a means to only the Lord-knows-what. \"We have reached that point when our social policy originates on Oprah. It's time to pull the plug.\" So who was the speaker Phillips was quoting in a speech made to an organisation called the Free Congress Foundation? Well, he was once an active union leader and supporter of the liberal Democrat Adlai Stevenson and took part in attempts to desegregate lunch counters during the civil rights movement. He was also, more famously, Moses and is now being given credit as someone who may have played a key part in the election of George Bush. And while Bill Clinton was unable to get the rules changed so that he could run for president for a third time, the speaker has just been the beneficiary of a rule change that allows him to run as the head of his organisation for an unprecedented third term. It is, of course, Charlton Heston. What has emerged since the election is that the 77-year-old actor and president of the National Rifle Association is now the most powerful show business figure in the Republican camp. While the Democrats always had a superfluity of support from actors and directors, writers and musicians, the Republicans have had to scrabble a bit to produce the kind of big names that add numbers to doors at rallies. But with Heston they have found someone who was able to draw in the faithful as never before. In a profile in the latest Los Angeles magazine, Ed Leibowitz uncovers some of the statements that Heston made while on the stump for Bush. In Grand Rapids, Michigan two weeks before the election, he told his audience that Gore, who had backed very mild gun reforms, had reneged on his commitments and said: \"In any other time or place, you'd be looking for a lynching mob.\" Some of the crowd shouted back: \"Let's do it. I've got a rope.\" Yet 40 years ago, Heston even favoured forms of gun control and campaigned on issues with such long-standing Hollywood liberals as Paul Newman. So what happened? He told Leibowitz that in 1964 he was being driven to the set of the War Lord when he noticed a billboard supporting Barry Goldwater, that year's right-wing Republican candidate against Lyndon Johnson, who later won. The words beside the picture of Goldwater read: \"In your heart you know he's right.\" Said Heston: \"That was my St Paul on the road to Damascus.\" During the campaign last year the NRA boasted that if Bush won they would have their own office inside the White House. This week, the latest beneficiaries of the NRA's policy of keeping access to guns as easy as possible were the four people killed by Willie Dan Baker at a factory in Melrose Park, Illinois. Baker, who was sacked by the firm five years earlier, killed himself after the attack. The event will have been forgotten by the day after tomorrow by all but those few people personally affected by it. Time to pull the plug, perhaps.

      "body": "<p>The word most people settled for in trying to describe Enoch Powell , who has died aged 85, was - leaving out the ruder ones - enigmatic. Scholar, soldier, statesman, arch-rebel, philosopher, poet, all crowded so glitteringly into so few early years. Here surely was something to wonder at, this neo-Renaissance figure with a Black Country accent. At the end of the story, the enigma had still not been solved. For we also had a monument of self-contradiction - a man of the hard right who could be a sensitive social reformer, a deeply committed Tory who could urge his colleagues to conspire with the enemy, a master of words who could use them with what many saw as gross irresponsibility, a devout loyalist who could lecture his queen, an atheist and a High Anglican. </p> <p> At one time and another he was all these. Powell had little time for anything in between, the reasonable man's halfway house where most tolerable life is carried on. Listening to a Powell speech could be a fascinating, benumbing experience he would use headlines to dazzle, plain words to bemuse. The language, perhaps the human mind itself, was never made to bear such logic.</p> <p> He carried lucidity to the point of obfuscation, even beyond it to somewhere near dementia. His written prose, including many sensible reviews were more normal but his verse, which shows some influence of A E Housman who taught him at Cambridge, clearly indicates the romantic urge driving him. </p> <p> Powell and Michael Foot, for years the two best speakers in the Commons, were poles apart politically but alike in their power to exert a mesmeric effect over even a hard-boiled Commons audience. They had a mutual regard, and often joined forces in tactical skirmishing against what they both saw as the common enemy, the Common Market. </p> <p> He was indeed a hard man to understand, and harder still to fit into current political categories. The contradiction clamoured: the imperialist who wanted to withdraw from the far east, the apparently cold man who once burst into passionate tears in the Commons, the confirmed anti-planner who took on the essentially planning job of minister of health in 1960. Nevertheless he regarded himself - and persuaded some admirers to regard him - as a model of logical consistency. </p> <p> Rational and romantic were at war in him, and it was not always the romantic that won. Nor was there anything obviously romantic, though there might have been to the eye of a Balzac or an Arnold Bennett, about the appearance and manner of this tense, unsmiling man. He looked more like a member of some obscure town council than one of the most controversial politicians of his day.</p> <p> Provincialism was of his essence and English Midland provincialism at that, than which there is none more introverted. But a Welsh ancestry fired his omplex nature. His parents were teachers, and he seemed born to exert diligence and acquire merit. He shone at King Edward's School in his native Birmingham and was a highly successful prize-winning student at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he became a fellow in the mid-1930s. </p> <p> By the time he was 25, he was Professor of Greek at Sydney University, and a second world war brigadier not so long after. Characteristically he had rushed home from Australia to enlist as a private in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, and promotion came quickly - as it did in all he put his hand and mind to, except his chosen career of politics. </p> <p> He could have been distinguished in academic life his work on Herodotus suggests that he could have made his mark as a classical scholar but his excursions into English verse, collected, in 1990, from several slim volumes, hardly suggest that we lost a poet when we gained a politician. The echoes of Housman - another classicist, controversialist and poet - were too audible. </p> <p> Powell worked for the Conservative Research Department, collaborating with Angus Maude on the pamphlet One Nation, and entered parliament on the big Tory wave of 1950. Powell's Birmingham voice and Wolverhampton constituency soon provided a new English centre of gravity there. A third dominant characteristic, probably linked with his provincialism and his romanticism, made itself felt. This was the urge to make a gesture, to stand conspicuously apart, to pit himself against established orthodoxies in his own party. He started in a small way, brushing with his local Conservative Association. It was as though he was rehearsing for major rebellions. </p> <p> The first came in 1958, when as financial secretary to the Treasury, he resigned with Peter (later Lord) Thorneycroft, the chancellor of the exchequer, and Nigel Birch, the economic secretary, in protest against the government's refusal to hold back public expenditure to a level acceptable to them - the episode which Harold Macmillan christened 'a little local difficulty'. The second was when he stood out against the king-making convulsions in the Conservative party which led to Sir Alec Douglas Home's succession. </p> <p> The third, and by far the most sensational, gesture compelled Heath to sack him from the shadow cabinet in April 1968, because of the 'rivers of blood' speech he made in Birmingham about immigration. It was made without consulting any of his colleagues, who criticised it more for the intemperance of its language than for its basic message. Those who had been patiently working for better race relations bitterly criticised that too. </p> <p> Whether Powell was truly a racialist is a matter of semantics. (Ironically, his bravest and most passionate speech at Westminster had demanded the exposure of British maltreatment of Mau Mau suspects in Kenya, a decade earlier.) Whether or not he calculated the result of the Birmingham speech in advance - there were few who believed he did not - they were easily calculable and the outcome was ugly. He raised fears and hatreds to a state of tension overnight. A pro-Powell campaign reached a pitch of near-hysteria and there were some unpleasant incidents. </p> <p> On the best interpretation Powell, a man of strong imperialist sympathies, was ungenerous in treating the post-imperial human legacy with such cynical or at least selfish disregard. Many held that he was also cashing in on genuinely-felt social fears. Nor was logic on his side. In his temperamental war with emotion, reason lost. This episode also brought out his most alarming and sometimes absurd characteristic, the Cassandra complex coupled with a penchant for Delphic utterance. References to 'the Tiber foaming with much blood' needed a sense of classical distancing easily missed in Wolverhampton's back streets . </p> <p> Powell was not the first or the last politician to be caught between the concept and the act, the purity of the idea and the twist and turns of real life, but in his case the gift for abstraction was so advanced that the gap yawned wider than for most. This created in him a sense of danger, a tension that communicated which was more than his argument always did. As a speaker in the Commons he often seemed to deploy a fiercely private logic, yet his carefully articulated, pedantic performances could make irrelevance sound prophetic. Few could always remember what he said, but they were always impressed by the intensity with which he said it. </p> <p> One of his early posts on achieving junior office was at Housing (1955-57). Then came the Treasury post from which he resigned over government spending. Yet it was as head of a major spending department, Health, that he reached the cabinet. </p> <p> The next phase of his career was marked by some searing attacks on political hypocrisy. Though ostensibly over his bitter opposition to the European Community and our part in it, the abandonment, in 1974, of his Wolverhampton seat and the Conservative party (over Europe) looked like self-punishment, almost a kind of self-mutilation for a man with his advanced sense of loyalty. </p> <p> He was afraid that the credibility gap between parliament and people was growing all the time, as was the need 'to match the person to the institution.' His personal attempt to do this, as he explained with a flash of the charm he could deploy when he chose, was to change 'the ugly accent compounded of Birmingham, Staffordshire and Australia' for the 'beautiful lilting language of Ulster.' But it was a deeper change he really sought it was the best, indeed the only, chance in sight of taking another stand against the demon of ambiguity and double talk. </p> <p> As Ulster Unionist member for South Down (1983-87) he lived in the world of absolutes, of jet blacks and shining whites. In that sense if in no other, he was at home. Asked in an unguarded moment during an interview how often he went to Ireland he replied coldly that he never went to Ireland but frequently went to Ulster. The continuing atrocities, in particular the Harrods bombing, he blamed on 'double talk and double-dealing on the part of Britain which has kept the IRA and their fellow murderers in business these last dozen years.' It was as MP for South Down that his private member's bill to ban research on human embryos failed to reach the statute books, but not before it had received considerable support. </p> <p> In December 1985 he resigned his seat in protest against the Anglo-Irish Agreement, and was re-elected at the ensuing by-election - but at the next general election, in 1987, he was out of parliament and it would have taken a brave prime minister to send him to the Lords as a parting present. It never happened. </p> <p> His last book, The Evolution of the Gospel (1994), was typically challenging, raising questions about how Christ might have died. Powell never grew old gracefully. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Pamela, whom he married in 1952, and two daughters. </p> <p><strong>Norman Shrapnel </strong></p> <p><strong>Mike Phillips writes: </strong>The first time I met Enoch Powell left me feeling embarrassed, guilty and a little sorry for him. These weren't emotions I would have predicted, given who he was, and the impact he had had on my life, but, this was late in the 1970s, and by then his audience had dwindled and his charisma had begun to fade. </p> <p> Even so, his name still had enough potency for the prospect of debating with him to carry a substantial emotional charge. The occasion was a BBC programme called The Editors. I am not sure what I was expecting but when we met, before the event, he was punctiliously courteous. He made small talk without being prompted, asking questions like how long it had taken me to get to Wood Lane, and whether the traffic had been bad. </p> <p> His voice was a surprise, too. I had expected to find it disturbing but, face to face, it was reedy, almost musical. He still sounded stiff, awkward with the cadences of informal chat, but I had no doubt about his sincerity, and resentful as I was, I began to think there was something immensely likeable about him. </p> <p> On the other hand, he wasn't all charm. As we walked to the make-up cubicle he remarked that since none of the participants appeared to be editors, perhaps the programme should be renamed. I hastened to point out that I was editor of an ethnic paper, but it was too late. He'd taken the high ground. </p> <p> At the time I was impressed. Over the years I had begun to think of him as a demagogue who'd struck it lucky, but in that moment, the silky fluency of his tone, combined with the sharpness of the glance he gave me was like a snake striking: and suddenly, like a new insight, it hit me that here was a dangerous old man. </p> <p> Not that I had ever thought of him as anything else. Up until Powell began making his speeches about race the views he was expressing had widespread currency in private but in public they were disreputable, stuck out there in a margin to the right of the Conservatives. Immigrants were accustomed to hearing white people complain, but in general, we had a sense that the Notting Hill riots in 1958 had been a watershed, after which a liberal consensus had emerged among the politicians which would, somehow, protect us if the worst came to the worst. </p> <p> Powell destroyed our complacency in one night. His speech about seeing the Tiber 'foaming with much blood' was like a key to Pandora's box. I'm not sure how strongly most other immigrants reacted, but we all felt the dramatic change. It was hard to say quite how it had happened, but Powell had become a rallying point for most of the hostility and rage we encountered, a shorthand for hatred and contempt. \"I'm with Enoch,\" they said, or \"they should let Enoch sort you lot out,\" and that was enough. </p> <p> What was hardest to bear, and most alarming, was the pervasive sense that the politicians, the people who were meant to be in charge, seemed to be afraid of him and what he could do. In those days he cropped up in all sorts of places. Johnny Speight's bigoted Alf Garnett, on TV every week, offered him up in a domesticated package and gave him a renewed currency. He became a myth, a bogyman, in whose name blacks and Asians were to be harassed and assaulted for the next couple of decades. </p> <p> In hindsight, I think it would be flattering Powell to say that he was entirely responsible for the effect of his speeches, but it's true that by marrying his version of nationalism to racist rage he gave British racism and racist violence in British streets its own peculiar shape for a time, and it bore his name, Powellism. He offered British politicians a model for racialist rhetoric which was to last for a long time - when, a decade later, Mrs Thatcher spoke of British civilisation being \"swamped\" the Powellite echoes were unmistakable, and successful. </p> <p> His memory will probably have me looking over my shoulder in the streets of my own city, London, for the rest of my life, and although the thought would probably make him furious, I shall always think of him as part of my history and as part of my identity as a Briton. </p> <p> John Enoch Powell, politician, born June 16 1912 died February 8 1998</p>",

His ironic point is that, overall, British business is doing nowhere near enough to help good causes, its annual contribution - some \u00a3315m in total - accounting for only 5% of the voluntary sector's donated income. </p> <p>Companies are about to find themselves under pressure to do much more. Armed with a new opinion poll showing that almost two-thirds of respondents feel that business chiefs don't do enough for charity, and that only one-third were aware of companies doing anything for their local communities, Etherington will launch a 10-point plan at the NCVO's annual conference in London today. The aim is to secure an extra \u00a31.25bn a year from corporate coffers. </p> <p>To help achieve this, the NCVO - the umbrella body for 1,700 charities in England - is asking the govern ment to incorporate aspects of the plan in its policies. And, in a pre-general election manifesto addressed to all political parties, the organisation is calling for the appointment of a cabinet minister for the voluntary sector. </p> <p>Both Labour and the Conservatives have stressed the importance of a strengthened partnership with the voluntary sector. Chancellor Gordon Brown wants to marshall thousands of new volunteers in a new civic spirit; while William Hague, acknowledging the initiatives of the churches, says that faith communities are a resource which a Tory administration would harness to repair Britain's damaged social fabric. </p> <p>The NCVO says charities have become the third sector in many respects: one employee in 50 works for a charity; overall, charities employ the equivalent of more than 350,000 full-time staff; and the sector contributes almost \u00a35bn to the GDP. From this position of strength, the NCVO reckons it is time for some straight talking to big business, which both Brown and Tony Blair have been exhorting to do more for the community. </p> <p>There are certainly good guys in boardrooms, says Etherington, and some household names are well known for their community work. But of that \u00a3315m given to charities, almost all of it (97%) comes from 400 top companies; and almost half (46%) from the top 25. </p> <p>Just a year ago, Brown called for a new chapter in corporate giving, comparing Britain's poor record - an average 0.2% of company pre-tax profits - with 1% in the US, totalling some $11bn (\u00a37.5bn). There has been little evidence of improvement in the past 12 months, in spite of measures to make corporate giving simpler. \"Politically, there must at some point be a discussion about whether exhortation is enough,\" says Etherington. \"A lot of firms have said this [corporate giving] is a good thing. We're saying: 'You've got to do this'; we're trying to push it further.\" </p> <p>Peter Davies, deputy chief execu tive of Business in the Community, whose members include 75% of the FTSE 100, argues that the voluntary sector undermines its own position of strength by taking the begging bowl approach to charitable giving. \"They should be pushing for sustained corporate community investment in partnership with companies and asking for handshakes rather than hand outs,\" he says. </p> <p>While the NCVO is keeping its detailed plans under wraps until Etherington's conference address, it is not too hard to guess some of the ideas it may have. It is very likely to press government to set a donations target of 1% of pre-tax profits, with all companies over a certain size having to comply within, say, five years. </p> <p>More than 100 companies presently belong to the Per Cent Club, set up to meet such a target. Some members exceed the target: Marks &amp; Spencer says that if its contribution to the multi-charity Children's Promise campaign is taken into account, it will be giving more than 1% this year. </p> <p>One idea that the NCVO is likely to borrow from the US is the recruitment of business leaders with good records of public giving to act as \"champions\" for their industry. Essentially, this means exerting peer pressure at chief executive officer level; spreading the message that strong support for community programmes is good for business. Another novel way to induce loosening of company purse-strings is for the public sector supply system to start a charter mark scheme, allowing only suppliers with a good record or level of charity work to tender for contracts. </p> <p>A municipal version of this is currently operating in Brighton. Adopted on a national level, it would allow government agencies and departments to use their massive spending power as coercion on the commercial sector. As such, it seems a relatively painless, no-cost way of moving towards that NCVO goal of an extra \u00a31.25bn a year. </p> <p>A further idea is simple and totally painless: companies would be required to set out clearly and in full what they do each year on the charitable front, in a section of their annual reports. </p> <p>It seems clear that the voluntary sector has Brown on-side; and while estimates of his budget surplus vary widely, it would be surprising if the NCVO will not be suggesting a few sweeteners, by way of tax incentives, that he could offer companies if they donated more of their pre-tax profits. </p> <p>But, overall, how willing are company directors to cough up? What Etherington calls \"the really advanced group\" already accepts the premise that markets generally function better in an environment of high trust. \"Where society is strong, voluntary organisations are strong, self-help is strong and trust relationships are strong, markets flourish,\" he says. </p> <p>Unless companies improve their record in line with government expectations, the NCVO's call for regulation could soon find an echo at Westminster. </p> <p><strong>With a little bit of care</strong></p> <p>Whitbread is a company that contributes 1.7% of pre-tax profits to the community - a total of \u00a34.3m last year. The hotel, food and leisure group which includes Pizza Hut and Marriott hotels, calculates the value of its support by adding its \u00a31.1m cash contributions - donations and matching the amount some of its 85,000 employees fundraise - with the \u00a3738,000 value it attributes to employee-volunteering, the \u00a31.2m worth of equipment recycled to community groups and the \u00a31.3 to manage its community programme. </p> <p>Its care (community action by recycling equipment) scheme has shifted more than 83,000 items to some 250 voluntary organisations.

      "body": "<p>When I was growing up, I didn't realise that my mum was the coolest, wittiest, most interesting woman I'd ever meet in all my gorgeous life. From the age of 12, I tried to avoid her as much as possible, feeling in some way that identifying with her too closely would rob me of all my sad little ambitions - to live in London, take drugs with pop stars and make it into Who's Who. </p> <p>Only once a week, regular as clockwork, did I find my mother's company desirable. That was at 11 sharp on a Saturday morning when, the paid working week done and the housework completed, she would go out into the backyard, whatever the weather, and wait by the left-hand fence for her neighbour, Lily. In a low, hypnotic murmur, the two of them would commence a complete run-down on the week's sexual and emotional shenanigans in our street, soon to be joined by Millie, who would vault spryly over the wall into Lily's garden, and Jo, who would jump over into ours. The four of them stood there for a solid hour, and during this time I would use any excuse to wander out into the garden and ingratiate myself with my mother. But she wouldn't have any of it. The minute I strolled out, the murmuring stopped and four irate faces glared at me. Only tempting tell-tale titbits lingered in the air; \"living in sin\", \"a black man!\" and once, memorably, \"living in sin with a black man!\". </p> <p>My father disapproved of these sessions, and as he never voiced disapproval of anything my mother did I knew that this was powerful stuff. Since that time I've been addicted to gossip, and seen it as not just a source of deep joy and spiteful fun but also as a weapon against all the po-faced politicos who love to lecture us about \"the issues mattering, not the personalities\". </p> <p>The only bad thing about moving up the social scale is that your house isn't joined to anyone else's anymore, and you don't know your neighbours anyway. </p> <p>This is where the internet comes in, of course. No matter how hard Mr Tony may try to convince us that it's a white-hot tool of information technology guaranteed to move us all into the knowledge-hungry middle class, its main function has been to reduce/elevate all of us to the status of ceaselessly gossiping old biddies slinging innuendo, half-truths and downright malicious lies across the worldwide electronic fence - and all on the boss's time, too! </p> <p>When the Great Crash of 2002 finally happens, it will be less to do with the collapse of confidence in the economy than the simple fact that, thanks to the internet, most people now spend most of their working hours gossiping. </p> <p>It's lovely, terrible logic when you think about it; the eternal feminine value of human-interest story telling corrupting, weakening and finally destroying the male conceit of dry, cold capitalism. </p> <p>I dread to think how little work was being done on both sides of the pond yesterday as the news of the end of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's 11-year marriage broke. All across the world fans were reaching out to dry each others' tears and give testimony to The God That Failed: \"I'm incredibly shocked and upset\"; \"Can't stop crying since I heard about it\"; \"They were the happiest couple in Hollywood!\"; \"Don't think I can face work today - but don't have net at home, so won't be able to chat! So must go in\". </p> <p>Over on the PopBitch website, meanwhile, where sour film and muse-biz has-beens and wannabes gather to mock and malign their hated idols, the tone was much less devastated. Stories, obviously untrue, came thick and fast: the time when one particularly strained dinner ended with Kidman flouncing to the desk and shouting: \"I'll have the check, and he'll have that guy at the table by the toilets\"; the one about how Kidman had signed a 10-year contract guaranteeing her an A-list career if she acted as \"beard\" to the sexually flexible Cruise, and a few others that could not be repeated in this newspaper. </p> <p>Why are we so shocked, and so fascinated by the end of just another showbiz marriage? Let's face it, when it comes to sex, actors are a breed apart; the phrase DCOL (Doesn't count on location) doesn't exist in any other profession. It's not even that actors are inherently slacker than the rest of us; it's just that their lives are essentially one long Temptation Island, during which they will be paid huge amounts of money to simulate sex and - even more lethal for a breed who can so easily mistake pretend life for real - love, with a non-stop parade of the most attractive people in the world. How many of us can honestly say that we could keep our hearts in cold storage with a naked Famke Janssen or Josh Hartnett crawling all over us? The wonder is not that film stars get divorced so much, but that any of them bother getting married at all. Why keep a steak at home when you've got a smorgasbord on location? </p> <p>Nevertheless, because we're spoony old things at heart, we like to believe that some showbiz marriages are different. These become our touchstone romances; proof that if a golden couple can resist all the temptations that the high life can throw at them, then surely we - who, let's face it, aren't very likely to be called upon to French kiss Angelina Jolie in the course of a day's work - can make ourselves stay on the straight and narrow. And we do, despite our sophistication, think we can differentiate between \"good\" couples and \"bad\" couples. No one expects Liam and Nicole to grow old together - or even to exchange presents at Christmas. But we expected it, for some reason, of Meg and Noel. And of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid, Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin. </p> <p>If we were wrong about them, what else were we wrong about? If a man can go off Kim Basinger, who's safe? Part of us panics petulantly, as though a favourite toy has been snatched away. And Tom and Nicole did seem . . . different. Why? Well, they lived over here for a few months, basically. The way that we forgave the Cruise-Kidmans anything - their weird rightwing \"religion\", their nasty habit of making staff liable for huge fines if a word about their private lives got out, their frankly sick-making films - just because they lodged in dear old Blighty for a few weeks is one of the sadder aspects of the whole affair; as with the recent genuflecting towards pub-Madonna by people old enough to know better, it just goes to demonstrate how low our national self-esteem has fallen if the fact that a famous yank takes a few dumps into our sewer system has us wetting ourselves with sheer molten joy. That they've deigned to leave America the Beautiful for five minutes. They take their kids to the park! He went to Blockbuster to get a video out! - our pathetic joy in being used briefly by famous Americans is truly tragic to behold. </p> <p>But the other part of us - the nasty, honest part - is secretly glad they've gone the way of all flesh, just as we were glad about Cindy and Richard, Ken and Em, Dawn and Lenny. Smug bastards! - filthy rich, gorgeous, successful AND happily married. Stars are meant to be lonely at the top, like Marilyn, Judy and James Dean; it's yer Faustian pact, innit? Come on - wasn't there always something a bit fishy about the Cruises? Especially when they tried to sex up their ailing union by making us all witness their alleged chemistry in Eyes Wide Shut, which backfired somewhat when Kidman, during her big love scenes with her husband, displayed all the transfixed lust of a woman trying to remember if this is the day the dry cleaning can be picked up. And offscreen they were just as non-incendiary; like Diana and Charles, there always seemed to be three people in the marriage - Tom, Nic and the camera. </p> <p>Look at them turning up at premieres - she kisses him while he smiles for the camera, then vice versa. They never seemed connected, private even in public, as obviously authentic lovers such as Zoe Ball and Norman Cook frequently do. </p> <p>The professional gossips are now weighing in with their wild, well-paid guesses; he's got another bird, she doesn't want to bring up their adopted children as Scientologists, she's jealous of his career. Whatever, their publicity machine has already trotted out the three great lies of modern divorce; it was pressure of work, it's an amicable break and there's no one else involved. In other words, they found that they both preferred being at work to being at home, the lawyers aren't involved yet and in six months time she'll be pregnant by some new kid on the block while he'll be all hooked up with some fresh-faced young beauty who really, really wants it. </p> <p>That's showbiz.</p>",

No matter how hard Mr Tony may try to convince us that it's a white-hot tool of information technology guaranteed to move us all into the knowledge-hungry middle class, its main function has been to reduce/elevate all of us to the status of ceaselessly gossiping old biddies slinging innuendo, half-truths and downright malicious lies across the worldwide electronic fence - and all on the boss's time, too! When the Great Crash of 2002 finally happens, it will be less to do with the collapse of confidence in the economy than the simple fact that, thanks to the internet, most people now spend most of their working hours gossiping. It's lovely, terrible logic when you think about it; the eternal feminine value of human-interest story telling corrupting, weakening and finally destroying the male conceit of dry, cold capitalism. I dread to think how little work was being done on both sides of the pond yesterday as the news of the end of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's 11-year marriage broke. All across the world fans were reaching out to dry each others' tears and give testimony to The God That Failed: \"I'm incredibly shocked and upset\"; \"Can't stop crying since I heard about it\"; \"They were the happiest couple in Hollywood!\"; \"Don't think I can face work today - but don't have net at home, so won't be able to chat! So must go in\". Over on the PopBitch website, meanwhile, where sour film and muse-biz has-beens and wannabes gather to mock and malign their hated idols, the tone was much less devastated. Stories, obviously untrue, came thick and fast: the time when one particularly strained dinner ended with Kidman flouncing to the desk and shouting: \"I'll have the check, and he'll have that guy at the table by the toilets\"; the one about how Kidman had signed a 10-year contract guaranteeing her an A-list career if she acted as \"beard\" to the sexually flexible Cruise, and a few others that could not be repeated in this newspaper. Why are we so shocked, and so fascinated by the end of just another showbiz marriage? Let's face it, when it comes to sex, actors are a breed apart; the phrase DCOL (Doesn't count on location) doesn't exist in any other profession. It's not even that actors are inherently slacker than the rest of us; it's just that their lives are essentially one long Temptation Island, during which they will be paid huge amounts of money to simulate sex and - even more lethal for a breed who can so easily mistake pretend life for real - love, with a non-stop parade of the most attractive people in the world. How many of us can honestly say that we could keep our hearts in cold storage with a naked Famke Janssen or Josh Hartnett crawling all over us? The wonder is not that film stars get divorced so much, but that any of them bother getting married at all. Why keep a steak at home when you've got a smorgasbord on location? Nevertheless, because we're spoony old things at heart, we like to believe that some showbiz marriages are different. These become our touchstone romances; proof that if a golden couple can resist all the temptations that the high life can throw at them, then surely we - who, let's face it, aren't very likely to be called upon to French kiss Angelina Jolie in the course of a day's work - can make ourselves stay on the straight and narrow. And we do, despite our sophistication, think we can differentiate between \"good\" couples and \"bad\" couples. No one expects Liam and Nicole to grow old together - or even to exchange presents at Christmas. But we expected it, for some reason, of Meg and Noel. And of Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid, Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin. If we were wrong about them, what else were we wrong about? If a man can go off Kim Basinger, who's safe? Part of us panics petulantly, as though a favourite toy has been snatched away. And Tom and Nicole did seem . . . different. Why? Well, they lived over here for a few months, basically. The way that we forgave the Cruise-Kidmans anything - their weird rightwing \"religion\", their nasty habit of making staff liable for huge fines if a word about their private lives got out, their frankly sick-making films - just because they lodged in dear old Blighty for a few weeks is one of the sadder aspects of the whole affair; as with the recent genuflecting towards pub-Madonna by people old enough to know better, it just goes to demonstrate how low our national self-esteem has fallen if the fact that a famous yank takes a few dumps into our sewer system has us wetting ourselves with sheer molten joy. That they've deigned to leave America the Beautiful for five minutes. They take their kids to the park! He went to Blockbuster to get a video out! - our pathetic joy in being used briefly by famous Americans is truly tragic to behold. But the other part of us - the nasty, honest part - is secretly glad they've gone the way of all flesh, just as we were glad about Cindy and Richard, Ken and Em, Dawn and Lenny. Smug bastards! - filthy rich, gorgeous, successful AND happily married. Stars are meant to be lonely at the top, like Marilyn, Judy and James Dean; it's yer Faustian pact, innit? Come on - wasn't there always something a bit fishy about the Cruises? Especially when they tried to sex up their ailing union by making us all witness their alleged chemistry in Eyes Wide Shut, which backfired somewhat when Kidman, during her big love scenes with her husband, displayed all the transfixed lust of a woman trying to remember if this is the day the dry cleaning can be picked up. And offscreen they were just as non-incendiary; like Diana and Charles, there always seemed to be three people in the marriage - Tom, Nic and the camera. Look at them turning up at premieres - she kisses him while he smiles for the camera, then vice versa. They never seemed connected, private even in public, as obviously authentic lovers such as Zoe Ball and Norman Cook frequently do. The professional gossips are now weighing in with their wild, well-paid guesses; he's got another bird, she doesn't want to bring up their adopted children as Scientologists, she's jealous of his career. Whatever, their publicity machine has already trotted out the three great lies of modern divorce; it was pressure of work, it's an amicable break and there's no one else involved. In other words, they found that they both preferred being at work to being at home, the lawyers aren't involved yet and in six months time she'll be pregnant by some new kid on the block while he'll be all hooked up with some fresh-faced young beauty who really, really wants it. That's showbiz.",

An angry crowd of about 200 people shouted abuse and hurled missiles at Roy Whiting as he left Chichester magistrates court. Mr Whiting, 42, spoke only to confirm his name and age during the 38-minute hearing at Chichester, West Sussex. He was wearing a red sweatshirt and flanked by three security guards when he stepped into the dock of the small 1970s courtroom. Presiding magistrate Michael Sugden, sitting with two others, refused an application for bail made on behalf of Mr Whiting, of Littlehampton, West Sussex. Mr Sugden indicated that Mr Whiting would appear for a preliminary hearing at Lewes crown court on February 19. Following the hearing, an angry crowd of more than 200 people chased the vehicle carrying Mr Whiting away from the court building. Members of the public shouted abuse as the van, escorted by police, sped away. The van stopped 100 yards down the road at a level crossing.

Lastminute.com is to notify consumers about offers by text message for the first time in a deal with mobile phone service company 12snap. The news comes a week after 12snap announced text messaging deals with McDonald's and American Express. Customers become a \"lastminute.com snapper\" by registering for the interactive service on a co-branded site www.12snap-lastminute.com. Registered users will receive a text message at lunchtime detailing that day's offers, which are exclusive to the service users and will not appear on the website. The customer is told what time the offers will become available - later that afternoon or evening - at which point they can call to buy. Some offers will be fixed price and some will allow customers to bid for the deal on offer. If a bid is unsuccessful, the customer will be notified by a text message and will be invited to submit a new bid. The service launches tomorrow and for an initial period there will be two one-hour snapper sessions a week. This means users will get a prompt text message with the deals twice a week - each time having an hour later in the day to respond. A spokeswoman for 12snap said the service would expand if successful and could become a daily service. \"We could do this every day, it is likely that this will become a more regular service,\" she said. A series of competitions will help launch the service - a Valentine's Day promotion gives customers the chance to win a pink Benilli scooter. Other prizes will include first-class tickets on Eurostar and a luxury weekend break in top UK hotels. The jointly branded service - messages will have both company's names attached to them - is also set to roll out in Germany and Italy, the other territories where the company has offices.",

      "body": "<p>As the electoral dust settles, Israeli political commentators are coming to terms with the extraordinary comeback of Ariel Sharon.</p> <p>Even the rightwing <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post </a> is guarded about the election of a rightwing prime minister. Its leader writer makes an extravagant comparison of Sharon with Winston Churchill, who \"was also considered a quirky and militant extremist before being ushered into power in a time of crisis.\"</p> <p>The paper rejects the notion that the Israeli electorate has turned its back on peace. Rather they have turned to Sharon as the leader most likely to achieve it. The Post has no doubt that his first and most urgent task is to form a broadbased government of national unity.</p> <p>On its main news pages, the Post points out that Barak's resignation as One Nation (aka Labour) party leader, will greatly complicate prime minister Sharon's task of forming a viable coalition in the perpetually fractious Knesset: \"Sharon is left with no one to parley with, when he doesn't have much time to squander. He cannot wait for Labour to choose a new leader and go through the primary process. Until then, though, the major players in Labour will be afraid of risking partnership with him. Barak's departure is bad news for Sharon.\"</p> <p>The liberal Tel Aviv daily, <a href=\"http://www.haaretzdaily.com\" target=\"_new\">Ha'aretz</a>, strongly backed Barak's campaign, now wishes the new prime minister well, and offers some cogent advice: \"Like others holding the post of prime minister before him, Sharon will also discover that the diplomatic and security reality seen from the prime minister's office is not identical to that on the outside. Sharon will have to make adjustments, both in himself and in his plans. The sooner he realizes this the better.\"</p> <p>The leader goes on: \"The foundation of the agreements reached by Israel and the Palestinians seven and a half years ago rested on Israel's understanding that the time had come to be rid of the occupation, on the one hand, and on the Palestinians' willingness to come to terms with the existence of Israel on part of the Land of Israel, on the other.</p> <p>\"These fundamentals are still valid today, despite the two sides' failure to translate their 1993 agreement of principles into a detailed peace treaty: the occupation of the territories cannot continue...</p> <p>\"Therefore, Sharon's first mission... is to continue moving on the path of reconciliation with the Palestinians, set in train by his predecessors. The need to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has become pressing as a result of the conflagration which erupted four months ago.</p> <p>\"Sharon has a choice: to take up the negotiations from the point at which they halted at Taba and continue in an effort to reach a peace agreement; or to turn in a completely different direction and fulfil the darkest predictions of his rivals, who forecast that his rise to power would mean the destruction of the peace process and the deterioration of Israeli-Palestinian relations into a broadbased armed confrontation. Choosing the second option would be disastrous.\"</p> <p>Perhaps the most chilling news story in Ha'aretz points out that Sharon has only until March 30 to complete the fiendishly complex business of coalition-building.

      "bodyText": "As the electoral dust settles, Israeli political commentators are coming to terms with the extraordinary comeback of Ariel Sharon. Even the rightwing Jerusalem Post is guarded about the election of a rightwing prime minister. Its leader writer makes an extravagant comparison of Sharon with Winston Churchill, who \"was also considered a quirky and militant extremist before being ushered into power in a time of crisis.\" The paper rejects the notion that the Israeli electorate has turned its back on peace. Rather they have turned to Sharon as the leader most likely to achieve it. The Post has no doubt that his first and most urgent task is to form a broadbased government of national unity. On its main news pages, the Post points out that Barak's resignation as One Nation (aka Labour) party leader, will greatly complicate prime minister Sharon's task of forming a viable coalition in the perpetually fractious Knesset: \"Sharon is left with no one to parley with, when he doesn't have much time to squander. He cannot wait for Labour to choose a new leader and go through the primary process. Until then, though, the major players in Labour will be afraid of risking partnership with him. Barak's departure is bad news for Sharon.\" The liberal Tel Aviv daily, Ha'aretz, strongly backed Barak's campaign, now wishes the new prime minister well, and offers some cogent advice: \"Like others holding the post of prime minister before him, Sharon will also discover that the diplomatic and security reality seen from the prime minister's office is not identical to that on the outside. Sharon will have to make adjustments, both in himself and in his plans. The sooner he realizes this the better.\" The leader goes on: \"The foundation of the agreements reached by Israel and the Palestinians seven and a half years ago rested on Israel's understanding that the time had come to be rid of the occupation, on the one hand, and on the Palestinians' willingness to come to terms with the existence of Israel on part of the Land of Israel, on the other. \"These fundamentals are still valid today, despite the two sides' failure to translate their 1993 agreement of principles into a detailed peace treaty: the occupation of the territories cannot continue... \"Therefore, Sharon's first mission... is to continue moving on the path of reconciliation with the Palestinians, set in train by his predecessors. The need to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has become pressing as a result of the conflagration which erupted four months ago. \"Sharon has a choice: to take up the negotiations from the point at which they halted at Taba and continue in an effort to reach a peace agreement; or to turn in a completely different direction and fulfil the darkest predictions of his rivals, who forecast that his rise to power would mean the destruction of the peace process and the deterioration of Israeli-Palestinian relations into a broadbased armed confrontation. Choosing the second option would be disastrous.\" Perhaps the most chilling news story in Ha'aretz points out that Sharon has only until March 30 to complete the fiendishly complex business of coalition-building. If he can't do it, the nation will be condemned to another prime ministerial election on April 15. Moreover, he has to persuade the Knesset to pass a national budget by March 31. Failure to win a budget majority, also carries the dire penalty of new parliamentary and prime ministerial elections within 90 days. On paper, Sharon is supported by eight factions in the Knesset, giving him a wafer-thin majority of 62 in the 120-seat chamber. But that cumbersome majority includes at least three orthodox religious parties, notorious for their budgetary scheming.

      "bodyText": "The Libyan jailed for the Lockerbie bombing today lodged an appeal against his conviction. A spokeswoman for the Scottish courts service said an \"intimation of notice of intent to appeal\" was lodged at the Justiciary Office in Edinburgh today. Libyan secret agent Abdel Baset al-Megrahi was found guilty of murdering 270 people when the long-running Lockerbie trial ended at a special Scottish law court at Camp Zeist, near Utrecht, Netherlands, last week. Once the office has the full documentation regarding the appeal it will be submitted to a single judge in chambers, who will grant or refuse leave to appeal. Legal experts consider it unlikely that an appeal would be refused. If it is, Megrahi's legal team could appeal against that refusal to a panel of three judges. Megrahi's solicitor, Alistair Duff, today refused to comment on the appeal move. Families of those who died in the 1988 disaster said they had expected an appeal to be lodged. Dr Jim Swire, spokesman for the UK Families of Pan Am 103 support group, said: \"We anticipated that this would happen and the matter is now back in the hands of the Scottish court.\" Clare Connelly, lecturer in criminal law and a member of the Lockerbie trial briefing unit at Glasgow University, said there was no automatic right of appeal under Scottish law and Megrahi had to seek permission to appeal. She said: \"He has merely lodged notice of appeal. In Scotland there are only two grounds for appeal - where there's been a miscarriage of justice or where new evidence has come to light. \"When the grounds [of any appeal] are lodged they will not be made public.

The deputy editor of the New Statesman, Christina Odone, will chair the panel, which will also include Sunday Times columnist Melanie Phillips and the chief executive of the NCVO, Stuart Etherington. </p> <p>The council has issued an agenda for the next general election on behalf of the voluntary sector, in which it asks political parties to sign up to the following set of principles:</p> <p>\u0095 Voluntary and community activity is fundamental to the development of a democratic, socially inclusive society and fulfils a role that is distinct from the state and the private sector</p> <p>\u0095 Government must recognise and support the independence of the sector, including its right within the law to campaign, to comment on government policy, and to challenge that policy, irrespective of any funding relationship that might exist, and to determine and manage its own affairs</p> <p>\u0095 Government has a responsibility to create and promote a favourable tax and fiscal environment in which the voluntary sector can flourish</p> <p>\u0095 Central, regional and local government must recognise that where they work, or want to work, in partnership with the sector, those partnerships must benefit all those involved and that government has a responsibility to invest time, skills and capacity to make them work. Government should ensure that the cost of engagement in partnerships for voluntary organisations is met, particularly at a local and community level</p> <p>\u0095 It is essential that government provides the voluntary sector with a long-term commitment of support. Short-term funding is short-sighted and seriously reduces the potential of the voluntary sector</p> <p>\u0095 Government should strive to ensure that it is consistent in all its dealings with the voluntary sector. A coordinated approach by all parts of the government to all its relationships with the sector would benefit all partners</p> <p>In addition it proposes that:</p> <p>\u0095 The Compact should become mainstream practice across all government departments</p> <p>\u0095 There should be a cabinet minister with responsibility for the voluntary sector</p> <p>\u0095 There should be a training programme for civil servants so they understand how the voluntary sector works</p> <p>\u0095 The government should consult the sector before the introduction of new legislation affecting charities</p> <p>\u0095 Tax incentives to encourage people to give to charities should be maintained and enhanced</p> <p>\u0095 The government should take responsibility for promoting long-term funding for charities</p> <p>\u0095 The principle of additionality should be observed in the distribution of lottery money - lottery money should not be used to fund government priorities</p> <p>\u0095 There should be a VAT rebate for the voluntary sector. The government needs to persuade the EC to change the rate of VAT applicable to charities</p> <p>\u0095 Charity law should be reformed. NCVO is currently reviewing the 400-year-old law applying to charities. The government should act on recommendations from the review and work to ensure that the sector is not overburdened with red tape</p> <p>\u0095 Free criminal record checks for volunteers and voluntary organisations</p> <p>\u0095 Young people should receive citizenship education with students offered placements and career advice on the voluntary sector</p> <p>\u0095 The government should commit resources to support the sector's own efforts to provide training and development to employers and employees</p> <p>One in 50 employees now works for the voluntary sector, and charities contribute nearly \u00a35bn to the UK's GDP. The agenda states: \"The sector plays a major role in developing an inclusive integrated society and government must allow the sector the freedom to do this.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Politicians from the three main parties with responsibility for the voluntary sector will participate in a Question Time-style debate today at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations conference. MPs Paul Boateng (Labour), David Lidington (Conservative) and Simon Hughes (Liberal Democrat) will take questions from the audience of voluntary sector representatives at 2pm GMT. The deputy editor of the New Statesman, Christina Odone, will chair the panel, which will also include Sunday Times columnist Melanie Phillips and the chief executive of the NCVO, Stuart Etherington. The council has issued an agenda for the next general election on behalf of the voluntary sector, in which it asks political parties to sign up to the following set of principles: \u0095 Voluntary and community activity is fundamental to the development of a democratic, socially inclusive society and fulfils a role that is distinct from the state and the private sector \u0095 Government must recognise and support the independence of the sector, including its right within the law to campaign, to comment on government policy, and to challenge that policy, irrespective of any funding relationship that might exist, and to determine and manage its own affairs \u0095 Government has a responsibility to create and promote a favourable tax and fiscal environment in which the voluntary sector can flourish \u0095 Central, regional and local government must recognise that where they work, or want to work, in partnership with the sector, those partnerships must benefit all those involved and that government has a responsibility to invest time, skills and capacity to make them work. Government should ensure that the cost of engagement in partnerships for voluntary organisations is met, particularly at a local and community level \u0095 It is essential that government provides the voluntary sector with a long-term commitment of support. Short-term funding is short-sighted and seriously reduces the potential of the voluntary sector \u0095 Government should strive to ensure that it is consistent in all its dealings with the voluntary sector. A coordinated approach by all parts of the government to all its relationships with the sector would benefit all partners In addition it proposes that: \u0095 The Compact should become mainstream practice across all government departments \u0095 There should be a cabinet minister with responsibility for the voluntary sector \u0095 There should be a training programme for civil servants so they understand how the voluntary sector works \u0095 The government should consult the sector before the introduction of new legislation affecting charities \u0095 Tax incentives to encourage people to give to charities should be maintained and enhanced \u0095 The government should take responsibility for promoting long-term funding for charities \u0095 The principle of additionality should be observed in the distribution of lottery money - lottery money should not be used to fund government priorities \u0095 There should be a VAT rebate for the voluntary sector. The government needs to persuade the EC to change the rate of VAT applicable to charities \u0095 Charity law should be reformed. NCVO is currently reviewing the 400-year-old law applying to charities. The government should act on recommendations from the review and work to ensure that the sector is not overburdened with red tape \u0095 Free criminal record checks for volunteers and voluntary organisations \u0095 Young people should receive citizenship education with students offered placements and career advice on the voluntary sector \u0095 The government should commit resources to support the sector's own efforts to provide training and development to employers and employees One in 50 employees now works for the voluntary sector, and charities contribute nearly \u00a35bn to the UK's GDP. The agenda states: \"The sector plays a major role in developing an inclusive integrated society and government must allow the sector the freedom to do this.\"",

Downing, 44, was being released from Littlehey prison in Cambridgeshire to await the hearing of an appeal against his conviction and life jail sentence for the killing of married typist Wendy Sewell. A spokesperson for Downing's parents, Ray, 66, and Juanita, 67, made a brief statement on their behalf outside their home in Bakewell: \"The Downings are absolutely over the moon and delighted with the news. \"It has not sunk in yet and they are both rather emotional. They don't know what their plans are and don't know if he is coming straight back.\" Mrs Sewell's badly beaten body was found in a cemetery where Downing worked in his home town of Bakewell, Derbyshire. Bail was not opposed by the crown, which conceded that the appeal was \"highly likely\" to succeed in the light of serious questions raised over the admissibility of Downing's confession statements, which formed a main plank of the prosecution case. Downing was 17 at the time of the killing but had the mental age of an 11-year-old. He has consistently denied murder and so has been ineligible for parole, which could have given him freedom 10 years ago. The criminal cases review commission referred his case to the court of appeal after years of campaigning by his parents, Ray and Juanita, and by Don Hale, editor of local newspaper, the Matlock Mercury. Mr Hale said the outcome was \"justification for old-fashioned investigative journalism\". He continued: \"I am absolutely delighted by the whole thing. It's fantastic news for me and obviously for Stephen and the whole family.\" Stephen Downing's parents refused to beyond their initial statement. It is understood they have secured an exclusive deal with a Sunday newspaper.

The principal repository of such \"literary remains\" in this country is the manuscripts department of the British Library.

Those of you in possession of this luxury are exempt from surface water drainage fees included in your water bill, although few of you were aware of this and water companies preferred it that way. Now you want to know why, if the companies have been taking money they weren't entitled to over the years, rebates may only be backdated to last April. \"Surely there's something disreputable about the way this fraudulent extra charging has been kept secret for so many years,\" says Jeffrey Ecclestone of London. </p> <p><strong>Not so, says the industry regulator Ofwat. In fact there's something very moral in the fact that the companies have now come clean. \"The cost of surface water drainage is shared equally among households because customers have to support vulnerable, less well-off householders,\" says a spokesman piously. \"Some areas have a lot of ground sumps and others none, so if rebates were backdated beyond last April, other customers' bills would have to go up to pay for it.\" The April watershed is due to Ofwat's efforts to break down water bills so householders can see where their money is going. \"In April we said we wanted to see surface water drainage itemised separately so that people could apply for a rebate if they didn't use that part of the service,\" says our spokesman.

The Daily Mail reports that Internazionale have made an attempt to reclaim their on-loan striker Robbie Keane from Leeds, a move swiftly rebuffed by David O'Leary's side. The paper quotes an Inter official as saying: \"Robbie Keane did not fail at Inter. He is a very talented player who simply did not get enough time on the pitch for a number of reasons.\" But Leeds have not been impressed by the flattery and will stick to the loan agreement which will keep Keane at the club until the end of the season. O'Leary said: \"At this rate, Robbie could end up firing us into Europe this season.\" Ipswich are in the process of bidding for a mystery player. \"There can be no certainty there will be a new arrival but I am hopeful,\" chairman David Sheepshanks said. \"There is no further progress at the moment because we are dealing with a very reluctant seller.\" Burnley are set to offer Coventry \u00a31m for striker John Aloisi.",

The advantage for Europe is that anyone arriving by any other route could be turned round at port and sent right back to these camps.

Few genuinely think there could (even should) be a totally open immigration policy into Europe, but understandably squirm at every alternative: the process of keeping the third world out will always be unpleasant and essentially racist. This is the sharp edge of the world's injustice where the faces of the poor appear on our own doorsteps. Eyeball to eyeball we push them back to a poverty only seen on television. Western human rights ideals look shabby when making nice distinctions between those in danger of persecution and those only risking starvation.

The backlog of old cases stands at 66,000. The government tosses figures around cavalierly - Straw was at it again in yesterday's speech - but they rarely are what they seem. For example, he said 80% of asylum seekers are refused. (The rest are the \"abusive\" poor). </p> <p>First of all, \"refused\" is a term of art. The system requires applicants dumped on God-forsaken sink estates to fill out a 20-page form in English, without a lawyer, within 14 days. If they fail to do it correctly they are deemed \"non-compliant\" and automatically refused asylum. There are seven days to appeal on another form, in English; most fail - or not. The Home Office triumphantly declares to the press that most are refused. But that's all a technicality, they are not actually sent back. That is not the end of the story. This arbitrary cruelty is all for show. Last year only some 8,000 people were actually deported. </p> <p>The fact is that almost all people who make it to these shores end up staying. It is practically impossible to send most of them back because there is no \"back\". Large numbers of Chinese, Filipinos and others have no documents and their embassies will not accept their nationality. (Some countries rely on the foreign money earned and sent home.) Other applicants wait so long to have their cases resolved it becomes impossible to remove them - long married with many children, settled with good jobs and employers who want to keep them. Many slip away and vanish. </p> <p> Most of the world's refugees are already camped on the borders of their own countries - the poorest nations forced to cope with the great exoduses caused by war-driven famine. According to Professor Guy Gordon-Gill, Oxford professor of international refugee law, only 0.3% of global refugees ever get anywhere near the EU: only the relatively rich or remarkably resourceful make it, so we need not fear a vast expansion of numbers. Keeping more of them in camps will do nothing to stop the criminal gangs bringing in illegals from China or eastern Europe. Nor will it become any easier to return them. Many will come, many will stay. There is no final solution. </p> <p>A recent UN population study predicts that in the next generation Italy will lose 28% of its population, Estonia 33% and Germany 25%. Already Europe is heavily dependent on unknown battalions of illegals who cook, clean and heave rubbish in the cities, pick and dig East Anglian fields. Illegals who disappear into the fabric of countries are no problem. The worst problems are caused by trying to contain them: for six months on vouchers they are kept in expensive, festering hell-holes, prevented from working though willing to do the worst jobs for the least pay. After that, they will make their own way and assimilate. So why bother? </p> <p>The Tory plan to lock up all 75,000 migrants and asylum seekers in detention centres indefinitely defies belief. What will happen to those who are not refugees but without papers can never be sent back? Will they stay there for ever? To imprison 60,000 a year would cost \u00a32bn to set up and \u00a31bn in running costs. (Figures not yet in Portillo's tax-spend plan.) Even if the government processed cases faster and the Home Office's catastrophic failure of administration were put right, most migrants could probably still not be deported. </p> <p>Both Jack Straw and Anne Widdecombe talk through their hat when they each propose new systems that will prevent/deter/end migration. Most asylum seekers come from the poorest most war-torn places - Somalia, Iraq, Iran and Sri Lanka. In the long run, the gradual spread of democracy and peace, solving problems at source - as in Sierra Leone - will be the only solution. How Britain can be rejecting Iraqis as genuine refugees while still bombing their dictator is unclear. But that is just another bizarre example of an impossible policy that can never be right.</p>",

Or Gaza either! (Judea and Samaria) belong to us. They have been ours for thousands of years, eternally.<br> <b>August 1982</b></p> <p>I do not leave here beaten, absolutely not.<br> <b>Speaking to defence ministry staff after being forced to resign, February 14 1983</b></p> <p>Yes, I am for the expulsion of anyone who throws a stone in the occupied territories.<br> <b> March 16 1988</b></p> <p>But while the civilian deaths were a tragedy, the Kibbiya (sic) raid was also a turning point. After so many defeats and demoralising failures it was now clear that Israeli forces were again capable of finding and hitting targets far behind enemy lines.<br> <b>On the commando raid he led in 1954, in which 69 civilians were killed in the Jordanian village of Qibiya, from his autobiography Warrior, published by Simon and Shuster, New York, 1989</b></p> <p>Standing with the cabinet ministers on a high hill, I pointed out exactly what I thought was needed. If in the future we wanted in any way to control this area, I told them, we would need to establish a Jewish presence now. Otherwise we would have no motivation to be there during difficult times later on.<br><b>On his plan to move Jewish settlers into the Gaza Strip in the early 1970s, from Warrior</b></p> <p>Like everyone who has ever experienced house-to-house fighting, I knew that in such actions there is no way to avoid civilian casualties, no matter what precautions are taken.<br> <b> On the massacre of up to 2,000 Palestinians in the Beirut refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila by Phalangist paramilitaries as Israeli soldiers looked on, from Warrior </b></p> <p>Although I was expecting a conclusion of this sort, I was outraged by the imputation of 'indirect responsibility'.<br> <b>On the subsequent criticism of the Kahan commission of inquiry, from Warrior </b></p> <p>Is the land ours? Are we completely sure we are not taking something from somebody else. Are we grabbing and stealing and laying claims to something to which we have no right? And as the doubts have thickened, the resolution and purpose have eroded.<br><b>On Israeli self doubt, from Warrior </b></p> <p>(Jordan) is a country where most of the population is Palestinian, most members of parliament are Palestinian, most of the cabinet is Palestinian, and most of the prime ministers have been Palestinian. Jordan is in fact if not in name a Palestinian state...<br><b>On the establishment of a Palestinian state, from Warrior</b></p> <p>Seize the hilltops.<br> <b> To Jewish settlers, November 17 1998</b></p> <p>I never accepted the Oslo agreement as it was.<br> <b> January 5 2000</b></p> <p>Jewish towns, villages and communities in Judea, Samaria [the occupied West Bank] and Gaza, as well as access roads leading to them, including sufficient security margins along them, will remain under full Israeli control.<br> <b>Jerusalem Post, July 21 2000</b></p> <p>It must be clearly understood that it wan't my visit to the Temple Mount - the holiest site for Jews and under full Israeli sovereignty - that ignited the current outbreak of violence.<br> <b> On his visit in September to the holiest Muslim site in Jerusalem, the Haram al-Sharif, revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, widely seen as a spark for the intifada</b></p> <p>I had a bad experience participating in all the wars and the major battles of the state of Israel in the last 50 years. I commanded maybe the best units and formations of the Israeli army, and always in the hardest parts of the battles. And I saw the horrors and the fears of war. I saw my friend being killed. I was badly injured twice in battle, and I felt those terrible pains in hospitals. I had to take decisions of life and death, of others and of myself. And therefore I believe that I understand the importance of peace better than many of the politicians who speak about peace but never had that experience.<br> <b>Maccabean online, November 14 2000</b></p> <p>Yasser Arafat is a murderer and a liar... He's an enemy. He's a bitter enemy.</p> <p>You know the Koran doesn't mention Jerusalem once ... When the Jews pray, all over the world they face the Temple Mount. When an Arab prays, he prays to Mecca. Even when an Arab is on the Mount, his back is to it. Also some of his lower parts.<br><b> On the campaign trail</b></p> <p>We must eliminate all those who lift their hand against Jewish children, who prevent the Israeli population from living normally. I prefer not to go into details; the main point is we must eliminate terrorism and those who go after Israelis.<br><b>In an interview conducted in November and published in the New Yorker on January 29</b></p> <p>I have opened contacts with Arab officials towards a multi-phased peace plan.<br><b>Army radio, January 22</b></p> <p>When I talk about painful concessions, I mean that we will not reoccupy Nablus and Jericho and other places. For me, this is a very painful concession. Because all these places are the cradle of birth of the Jewish people.</p> <p>We have to start with the assumption that peace is as important to the Palestinians as it is to us. Instead of our starting position being that Arafat is doing us a favour and we have to pay for peace, we have to begin with the assumption that the Palestinians need peace now less than us, and therefore, we must ask Arafat what he is prepared to give or pay in exchange for peace.<br><b> Quotes above published in an ultra-orthodox Jewish weekly, Kfar Habad in January</b></p> <p>I've always been a moderate. There is no difference from the old Sharon.

      "bodyText": "Here is a selection of the thoughts of the man who, within hours, is likely to become the most powerful man in Israel and indeed the Middle East: No one will touch Judea and Samaria [the occupied West Bank]! Or Gaza either! (Judea and Samaria) belong to us. They have been ours for thousands of years, eternally. August 1982 I do not leave here beaten, absolutely not. Speaking to defence ministry staff after being forced to resign, February 14 1983 Yes, I am for the expulsion of anyone who throws a stone in the occupied territories. March 16 1988 But while the civilian deaths were a tragedy, the Kibbiya (sic) raid was also a turning point. After so many defeats and demoralising failures it was now clear that Israeli forces were again capable of finding and hitting targets far behind enemy lines. On the commando raid he led in 1954, in which 69 civilians were killed in the Jordanian village of Qibiya, from his autobiography Warrior, published by Simon and Shuster, New York, 1989 Standing with the cabinet ministers on a high hill, I pointed out exactly what I thought was needed. If in the future we wanted in any way to control this area, I told them, we would need to establish a Jewish presence now. Otherwise we would have no motivation to be there during difficult times later on. On his plan to move Jewish settlers into the Gaza Strip in the early 1970s, from Warrior Like everyone who has ever experienced house-to-house fighting, I knew that in such actions there is no way to avoid civilian casualties, no matter what precautions are taken. On the massacre of up to 2,000 Palestinians in the Beirut refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila by Phalangist paramilitaries as Israeli soldiers looked on, from Warrior Although I was expecting a conclusion of this sort, I was outraged by the imputation of 'indirect responsibility'. On the subsequent criticism of the Kahan commission of inquiry, from Warrior Is the land ours? Are we completely sure we are not taking something from somebody else. Are we grabbing and stealing and laying claims to something to which we have no right? And as the doubts have thickened, the resolution and purpose have eroded. On Israeli self doubt, from Warrior (Jordan) is a country where most of the population is Palestinian, most members of parliament are Palestinian, most of the cabinet is Palestinian, and most of the prime ministers have been Palestinian. Jordan is in fact if not in name a Palestinian state... On the establishment of a Palestinian state, from Warrior Seize the hilltops. To Jewish settlers, November 17 1998 I never accepted the Oslo agreement as it was. January 5 2000 Jewish towns, villages and communities in Judea, Samaria [the occupied West Bank] and Gaza, as well as access roads leading to them, including sufficient security margins along them, will remain under full Israeli control. Jerusalem Post, July 21 2000 It must be clearly understood that it wan't my visit to the Temple Mount - the holiest site for Jews and under full Israeli sovereignty - that ignited the current outbreak of violence. On his visit in September to the holiest Muslim site in Jerusalem, the Haram al-Sharif, revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, widely seen as a spark for the intifada I had a bad experience participating in all the wars and the major battles of the state of Israel in the last 50 years. I commanded maybe the best units and formations of the Israeli army, and always in the hardest parts of the battles. And I saw the horrors and the fears of war. I saw my friend being killed. I was badly injured twice in battle, and I felt those terrible pains in hospitals. I had to take decisions of life and death, of others and of myself. And therefore I believe that I understand the importance of peace better than many of the politicians who speak about peace but never had that experience. Maccabean online, November 14 2000 Yasser Arafat is a murderer and a liar... He's an enemy. He's a bitter enemy. You know the Koran doesn't mention Jerusalem once ... When the Jews pray, all over the world they face the Temple Mount. When an Arab prays, he prays to Mecca. Even when an Arab is on the Mount, his back is to it. Also some of his lower parts. On the campaign trail We must eliminate all those who lift their hand against Jewish children, who prevent the Israeli population from living normally. I prefer not to go into details; the main point is we must eliminate terrorism and those who go after Israelis. In an interview conducted in November and published in the New Yorker on January 29 I have opened contacts with Arab officials towards a multi-phased peace plan. Army radio, January 22 When I talk about painful concessions, I mean that we will not reoccupy Nablus and Jericho and other places. For me, this is a very painful concession. Because all these places are the cradle of birth of the Jewish people. We have to start with the assumption that peace is as important to the Palestinians as it is to us. Instead of our starting position being that Arafat is doing us a favour and we have to pay for peace, we have to begin with the assumption that the Palestinians need peace now less than us, and therefore, we must ask Arafat what he is prepared to give or pay in exchange for peace. Quotes above published in an ultra-orthodox Jewish weekly, Kfar Habad in January I've always been a moderate. There is no difference from the old Sharon. After being demonised for so many years, you had the wrong impression. Campaigning at Tuvlan Post, West Bank, in January I want to say something about my demonisation. After all, I am known as someone who eats Arabs for breakfast. This is baseless. People are killed in wars. But I never allowed the mistreatment of a prisoner, and I never humiliated anyone.

      "bodyText": "The newly-elected Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, will today begin the difficult task of forming a coalition government in a deeply divided political landscape. Israel yielded to the dark fears unleashed by a Palestinian uprising yesterday, voting by a staggering margin to entrust their future to Mr Sharon, a man famous for making war. Amid the clatter of gunfire on a Palestinian \"day of rage\" in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israelis delivered a crushing defeat to Ehud Barak, and chose a new leader in a battle-scarred warrior with a past so tainted he would only a few months ago have been deemed unelectable. The result marked an overwhelming rejection by the Israeli people of the eight-year-old Oslo peace process. With 99.9% of votes counted, Sharon took a historic 62.5% of the popular vote, while Mr Barak - with just 37.4% - resigned from the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, and stood down as leader of the Labour party. Mr Sharon now has 45 days to form a coalition government to stand alongside his victorious Likud party, a task that will be made more difficult by a Labour leadership crisis. At Labour's election headquarters, Mr Barak responded to his humiliation with his trademark cocksure style. \"My friends, we have lost the battle, but we will win the war,\" he said. \"The path we have chosen is the only right path, the path that will ultimately lead the state of Israel to peace and security.\" But as yesterday's vote so amply demonstrated, Israelis have not only lost their faith in the man, but in his mission. Disappointed by a leader who swept to power 20 months ago on a promise of peace only to deliver a bloody Palestinian uprising, they decisively turned their back on negotiations - at least for now.

He also opposes any territorial concessions - a hardline stand that could squash remaining hopes for peace in the Middle East. But in his victory speech last night, he clung to the new, softer image adopted for this campaign. \"Today, the state of Israel embarks on a new path, a path of peace and unity, striving for a new peace, peace with security,\" Mr Sharon told an ecstatic crowd of supporters. At the end of the speech he displayed a flash of his more combative side, vowing \"my government will act to restore security to the citizens of Israel and to achieve a real peace and stability in the area.\" For Israelis that is shorthand for rejecting further compromises on territory until the uprising ends. George Bush, the US president, delivered congratulations to the new Israeli leader last night, saying the US-Israeli relationship was \"rock solid\". Earlier, the US secretary of state Colin Powell had called for calm in Israel and said America would not be \"standoffish\" in its stance on the Middle East.

He spent four hours there. \"A photograph doesn't show the flies nor the thick white smell of death,\" he wrote. \"It does not show how you must jump over bodies as you walk along from one corpse to the next.\" Estimates vary as to how many were murdered at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps because there are two mass graves in Beirut which have never been exhumed. The usual reckoning is up to 2,000, overwhelmingly old men, women and children. But there is no confusion about who was responsible for the massacres. Israel's very own internal inquiry, the Kahan commission, stated that Ariel Sharon, then defence minister, bore \"personal responsibility\" for the atrocities inside the camps. The Christian fascist Phalange militia had carried out the murders while Sharon and his men guarded the entrances and provided flares to give enough light to kill by. That a state so often cited as an oasis of democracy in the Middle East should elect a war criminal as prime minister is shocking enough. That up to a million Israelis protested at Sharon's behaviour at the time - he was described as \"an enemy of the people\" and \"worse than evil\" in the Knesset and the action against him was the largest protest demonstration in Israel's history - shows the depths to which the 34-year-old occupation has taken Israeli society. There is little doubt that Sharon's election will mean more aggressive treatment of the Palestinians; the settlers' favourite, the man who once urged fellow right wing fanatics to \"run, grab hills\", is unlikely to grant a Palestinian state or allow freedom or equality or other such radical notions. So why do so many Palestinians see Sharon's election as more of the same? Why are they not so alarmed as Western observers expect them to be? The answer is encapsulated in one word: despair. While their leaders were shaking hands on White House lawns, promising compromise and solution and common ground, the real situation for Palestinians was getting worse. The liberal West might have jumped for joy at the landslide election of Labour's Ehud Barak, but what was happening on the ground?

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Joe Penhall is one of the greatest writers working today. So when I was asked to direct a reading of his play Blue/Orange in Ireland recently, I felt both privileged and scared. Joe came over and sat in on the rehearsals and the reading. Afterwards he said to me that it was the first time he had actually heard the play in ages. We used Irish and British actors but the sense of our production seemed very different from the London one. </p> <p>Naturally I was glad that I had delivered the goods, but I was also intrigued by the cultural differences that made the production so different in Ireland. Joe seemed impressed by the actors' ability to mine the emotional depths in the play, which revolves around a young black man detained in a British psychiatric hospital. Their performances were personal and owned by them. They trusted what they were doing and their confidence allowed them a freedom to express what many people feel fundamentally - loneliness, a need to be loved and a need to feel safe. </p> <p>These were the things I felt were important in the play. I'm not British, I'm from Dublin, so the collapse of the NHS isn't as important to me as it is for sick people in the UK. And I began to think about what it is that makes Irish plays so different from English ones. </p> <p>In a densely populated placed like London space is precious. People squeezed together on the tube breast to breast pretend they're not really there. But if you were to walk down a deserted shoreline and saw a figure in the distance, as they came closer to you you'd probably acknowledge them. A nod or a hello. </p> <p>Ireland is less populated. It's easy to avoid other people. Irish plays tend to explore the inner workings of the human being, how it feels to be alive and the difficulty we have communicating our feelings. British plays veer more towards journalism: \"Look at the state of the NHS/British socialism/ what Thatcher did/drugs among our youth/Aids/power struggles in the home/the police/my flat/London, etc.\" </p> <p>And I began to think about why a small country such as Ireland has produced more great playwrights than so many more populated countries. It's extraordinary. There are fewer than 4m people in the Republic of Ireland. But in the past century we've produced Synge, O'Casey, Shaw, Wilde, Joyce, Beckett, Friel, Tom Murphy, Billy Roche,Sebastian Barry, to name a few. Their plays have shaped the way people think and are performed all over the world. Why the disproportion? </p> <p>Although some of the above were Protestants, I think it has something to do with growing up in a predominantly Catholic culture. </p> <p>When I started school at the age of four, I was educated to believe that I was a bad person. I was told I'd be lucky if God forgave me. Every week I was made to confess to a priest. Until I was nine, corporal punishment was legal. I grew up in a working-class area and the same teachers who taught us religion also physically attacked us. </p> <p>As a kid I became used to being hit by an adult every day. Some used their hands, some sticks of wood. I remember the exhaustion in a teacher's face after he'd lined up the whole class and beaten each one because we were talking to each other while he left the room. I was eight at the time. </p> <p>If this constant reinforcement of your badness and guilt happens to you at such a vulnerable age, it seems to me inevitable that you are going to start thinking about the quality of your character.

      "bodyText": "Joe Penhall is one of the greatest writers working today. So when I was asked to direct a reading of his play Blue/Orange in Ireland recently, I felt both privileged and scared. Joe came over and sat in on the rehearsals and the reading. Afterwards he said to me that it was the first time he had actually heard the play in ages. We used Irish and British actors but the sense of our production seemed very different from the London one. Naturally I was glad that I had delivered the goods, but I was also intrigued by the cultural differences that made the production so different in Ireland. Joe seemed impressed by the actors' ability to mine the emotional depths in the play, which revolves around a young black man detained in a British psychiatric hospital. Their performances were personal and owned by them. They trusted what they were doing and their confidence allowed them a freedom to express what many people feel fundamentally - loneliness, a need to be loved and a need to feel safe. These were the things I felt were important in the play. I'm not British, I'm from Dublin, so the collapse of the NHS isn't as important to me as it is for sick people in the UK. And I began to think about what it is that makes Irish plays so different from English ones. In a densely populated placed like London space is precious. People squeezed together on the tube breast to breast pretend they're not really there. But if you were to walk down a deserted shoreline and saw a figure in the distance, as they came closer to you you'd probably acknowledge them. A nod or a hello. Ireland is less populated. It's easy to avoid other people. Irish plays tend to explore the inner workings of the human being, how it feels to be alive and the difficulty we have communicating our feelings. British plays veer more towards journalism: \"Look at the state of the NHS/British socialism/ what Thatcher did/drugs among our youth/Aids/power struggles in the home/the police/my flat/London, etc.\" And I began to think about why a small country such as Ireland has produced more great playwrights than so many more populated countries. It's extraordinary. There are fewer than 4m people in the Republic of Ireland. But in the past century we've produced Synge, O'Casey, Shaw, Wilde, Joyce, Beckett, Friel, Tom Murphy, Billy Roche,Sebastian Barry, to name a few. Their plays have shaped the way people think and are performed all over the world. Why the disproportion? Although some of the above were Protestants, I think it has something to do with growing up in a predominantly Catholic culture. When I started school at the age of four, I was educated to believe that I was a bad person. I was told I'd be lucky if God forgave me. Every week I was made to confess to a priest. Until I was nine, corporal punishment was legal. I grew up in a working-class area and the same teachers who taught us religion also physically attacked us. As a kid I became used to being hit by an adult every day. Some used their hands, some sticks of wood. I remember the exhaustion in a teacher's face after he'd lined up the whole class and beaten each one because we were talking to each other while he left the room. I was eight at the time. If this constant reinforcement of your badness and guilt happens to you at such a vulnerable age, it seems to me inevitable that you are going to start thinking about the quality of your character. Am I a good person? And that starts you thinking about character in general. About characters. The storytelling tradition in Ireland is still very strong. Stories allow the listener to go through experiences virtually, without having to face the consequences. You identify with the character: \"What if I did that? How would I feel? How would I cope?\" And I suppose in a way it's therapeutic. It's helpful. And I suppose that's the difference between English and Irish plays. Protestants are told they're free to protest. So you have so many playwrights who argue that their work has a political validity - Pinter, Hare, Brenton, Edgar, Wesker, etc - whereas Irish writers are mostly a bit scared. If there's a message, it's a simple one: \"I know you're afraid of dying alone in a ditch. I am too. Let's be together.\" And maybe that's why Irish plays have a universal popularity.

But last year, Ms Schoening stepped in to help turn around sales for the under-performing Gap chain. She took the unusal step of going outside the company's in-house advertising teams. She hired Boston-based ad agency Modernista on a project basis to create the Christmas and spring campaigns. In her new role, Ms Schoening will report directly to Gap Inc president and CEO Millard Drexler. Her promotion leaves Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy without individual marketing chiefs. However, the company is believed to be recruiting to fill the vacancies. The new marketing directors will continue to report to the presidents of the separate brands. However, a \"dotted line\" will be established to Ms Schoening. The retailer's in-house advertising units will not be consolidated or disbanded.

My friends, Silvan Shalom, chairman of my headquarters, and Reuven Rivlin, chairman of the Parliamentary Party -- the faction, all members of Knesset, from this large camp who are sitting here, people from the Likud and all the other parties: MK Eli Yishai, and MK Natan Sharansky, MK Avigdor Liberman, MK Itzak Levy, Rabbi Menachem Porush and Rabbi Meir Porush, two generations. Michael Kleiner, my friend for many years, David Levy, and mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert. Together with you we have reached this wonderful point, and made this marvellous achievement.</p> <p>I want to say that a few moments before I came into the hall, when I was already in the building, the president of the United States, President Bush, called me, and asked me to present his best wishes to you. He told me that they want to cooperate very closely with the government under my leadership.</p> <p>And he reminded me of the trip I took with him through Samaria and the Jordan Valley. And at that time, he said to me, \"No one believed then,\" he said, \"that I would be president and you would be prime minister. But as things turned out, despite the fact that no one believed us,\" he said, \"I have been elected president, and you have been elected prime minister.\"</p> <p>Citizens of Israel, my colleagues from various parties, today the state of Israel has embarked on a new path, a path of domestic unity and harmony, of striving for security and a real genuine peace.</p> <p>I would like to thank every single one of you for your support, for your involvement, for your devotion, for your hard work. It's as a result of your work and this great confidence that you have shown in me and the thousands and thousands of individual activists throughout Israel that we have achieved this great victory. We have achieved this moment, and we thank you from the bottom of our heart.</p> <p>This night is a very moving night. It's one of great significance for me.</p> <p>From the very earliest days, I have entirely devoted myself to the country to consolidating its security and building it up. In all of my possessions, in all moments, whether hard or happy, I was accompanied by my dear wife, Lily, who supported me wholeheartedly. At this moment, when the Israeli people have expressed their confidence in me to lead the country in the next few years, Lily is not with me anymore, and I miss her. She's not with me here.</p> <p>I want, this evening, to thank every single one of Israel's citizens who have expressed their confidence in me. I shall do everything in order to succeed in this mission that you have consigned to me.</p> <p>This is the state of all of us, and all of us have a joint future and a single destiny. In the course of the years, divisions, incisions in our people and society have proliferated. Baseless hatred and fury have multiplied. The time now has come to seek for as wide-based unity and agreement as possible. There is a deep-felt desire among the people to stand firmly together in dealing with the challenges of the future. I call now for the establishment of as wide a government of national unity as possible.</p> <p>And I here turn to the Labour Party and call upon it to join us in a partnership in pursuing the difficult path towards security and peace.</p> <p>Citizens of Israel, today you have called upon me to lead you as prime minister of Israel, and to succeed in the mission you have conferred upon me. I shall, to do this, need the confidence of the Knesset, and the maximum support of its members. We live in a parliamentary system in which the government functions on the basis of a parliamentary majority.</p> <p>As prime minister, I will act responsibly and with respect to the parliament, to the Knesset, and with regard to all members of the house. The government, under my leadership, will act to implement the rule of law, and to maintain the independence of the judicial system, which is one of the pillars of maintaining a democratic system.</p> <p>Citizens of Israel, the government, under my leadership, will act to restore security to the citizens of Israel, and to achieve a genuine peace and stability in the area.</p> <p>I'm aware of the fact that peace requires painful compromises by both sides. Any and every political arrangement will be based on security for all peoples of the region. I call upon our Palestinian neighbours to cast off the path of violence and to return to the path of dialogue and solving the conflicts between us by peaceful means.</p> <p>The government, under my leadership, will act to achieve genuine political settlements that will preserve the existential and historic needs of Israel, which will be based on mutual respect and mutual security.</p> <p>We shall act to achieve more profound reciprocal relationships with our great friend and our ally the United States. And we shall strive to achieve closer ties between the state of Israel and the countries of the world.</p> <p>In Israeli society, there are many areas of distress with which I am familiar. We will do everything we can to wipe these out. A people cannot exist if there is no social solidarity. We shall act to reduce the social gaps and to achieve equality of opportunity to everybody.</p> <p>We will turn over a new leaf in our relationships with our Israeli Arab citizens in order to achieve a genuine partnership and a feeling of equality between all citizens of the country.</p> <p>The government, under my leadership, will fly the social flag side-by-side with the flag of security and peace, and we will be greatly supporting the value of education.</p> <p>And above both flags, there will be the flag of Zionism, the flag of national honour, immigration and settlement. The government, which I shall set up will strive to strengthen and consolidate united Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, and the eternal capital of the Jewish people; to which we always turn, saying, \"If I forget thee, oh Jerusalem, may my right hand forget it's coming. May my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not make Jerusalem the chief of my joys.\"</p> <p>The government, under my leadership, will act to achieve constant economic growth, and in this way, we will create new employment possibilities and reduce unemployment. We will maintain price stability and prevent inflation.</p> <p>We will ensure that we act responsibly in the economic area, without increasing any deficit. And at the same time, we will invest in infrastructure and education. We will reduce the tax burdens on Israeli citizens. We will maintain the principles of a modern, open economy, based on competition and integration in the world economy.</p> <p>To achieve these goals, it is my intention to establish an economic cabinet, which I shall head.</p> <p>Citizens of Israel, we have a small country which is blessed with taieved greatly. Let us join forces as one single body, with one single heart, setting out on a new path. Together, we will be ready to face all the challenges confronting us. Together, we will be able to realise all of our hopes and our dreams. Thank you.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434600,00.html\">07.02.2001: End of road for humiliated Barak</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434608,00.html\">07.02.2001: Israel gives up on peace with Sharon victory</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434602,00.html\">07.02.2001: Israel's dark hour</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,434618,00.html\">07.02.2001: Sharon in his own words</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,381501,00.html\">Timeline</a><br></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7edcc\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/wto/flash/0,6189,380127,00.html\">An interactive history of Israel</a></p> <p><b>Video</b><br> <a href=\"http://play.rbn.com/?url=ap/nynyt/g2demand/0206israel_sharon.rm&amp;proto=dual\" target=\"_news\">Ariel Sharon's victory speech, from the New York Times</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0112goldenberg2.ra\">Suzanne Goldenberg in Jerusalem: Israelis divided ahead of crucial election (2mins 35)</a></p> <p><b>Key players</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,433318,00.html\">Ariel Sharon: from butcher to 'Lion' to Prime Minister of Israel</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,378609,00.html\">Ehud Barak: the main loser</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,381921,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Supreme test for 'Mr Palestine'</a></p> <p><b>From the Guardian archive</b><br> <a href=\"http://guardiancentury.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,6051,105109,00.html\" target=\"_new\">15.05.1948: Jewish state is born</a><br> <a href=\"http://guardiancentury.co.uk/1940-1949/Story/0,6051,105125,00.html\" target=\"_new\">19.11.1948, Arthur Koestler: Israel's the new generation</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.info.gov.il/eng/min-pmo.htm\" target=\"_new\">Office of the Israeli Prime Minister</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.israel-mfa.gov.il/mfa/go.asp?MFAH00pq0\" target=\"_new\">Peace process: reference documents in full</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.knesset.gov.il/knesset\" target=\"_new\">Israeli Knesset</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.4321.co.il/no\" target=\"_new\">Email Barak, Sharon and Arafat</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/\" target=\"_new\">Jerusalem Post</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.ptimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Palestine Times</a></p>",

We will do everything we can to wipe these out. A people cannot exist if there is no social solidarity. We shall act to reduce the social gaps and to achieve equality of opportunity to everybody. We will turn over a new leaf in our relationships with our Israeli Arab citizens in order to achieve a genuine partnership and a feeling of equality between all citizens of the country. The government, under my leadership, will fly the social flag side-by-side with the flag of security and peace, and we will be greatly supporting the value of education. And above both flags, there will be the flag of Zionism, the flag of national honour, immigration and settlement. The government, which I shall set up will strive to strengthen and consolidate united Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, and the eternal capital of the Jewish people; to which we always turn, saying, \"If I forget thee, oh Jerusalem, may my right hand forget it's coming. May my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not make Jerusalem the chief of my joys.\" The government, under my leadership, will act to achieve constant economic growth, and in this way, we will create new employment possibilities and reduce unemployment. We will maintain price stability and prevent inflation. We will ensure that we act responsibly in the economic area, without increasing any deficit. And at the same time, we will invest in infrastructure and education. We will reduce the tax burdens on Israeli citizens. We will maintain the principles of a modern, open economy, based on competition and integration in the world economy. To achieve these goals, it is my intention to establish an economic cabinet, which I shall head. Citizens of Israel, we have a small country which is blessed with taieved greatly. Let us join forces as one single body, with one single heart, setting out on a new path. Together, we will be ready to face all the challenges confronting us. Together, we will be able to realise all of our hopes and our dreams. Thank you.

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch is set to pull off the \u00a340bn acquisition of DirecTV, paving the way for the long-awaited flotation of Sky Global Networks. Investors are eagerly anticipating an announcement at 2pm London time, when News Corporation posts its second quarter results. Speculation of a deal mounted following overnight reports that the mammoth merger had been agreed in principle. In what would be the biggest deal of his career, the chairman of News Corporation is expected to confirm the acquisition of the US satellite TV company DirecTV. It is expected that Sky Global Networks will merge with DirecTV's parent company Hughes Electrics, and Mr Murdoch will share ownership of the enlarged group with Hughes owner General Motors. Sky Global, which is formed by News Corporation's satellite TV interests and includes BSkyB and Asian broadcaster Star TV, will initially form 35% of the new company, with Hughes shareholders controlling the rest. However, Hughes shareholders will then exit over time, leaving News Corporation as the largest single shareholder and controller of the world's largest satellite TV company. Mr Murdoch has long considered DirecTV as the potential jewel in the crown of Sky Global, with its 10m subscribers offering a strong US presence to the company. A bullish News Corporation said it would float the company with or without DirecTV, but the financial markets would have balked at investing in a global media player which did not have a US footprint. As late as last week, it was feared that GM would scupper the complex deal, with the automotive giant saying it was talking to several interested parties. News Corporation insiders dismissed GM's claims as an attempt to push up the price of the deal.",

He was generous to his predecessor, but identified the failure of Mr Birt to retain the support of his staff during the changes he made. \"John Birt's achievements should not be underestimated. But he did not get staff on his side. It was a really interesting challenge (for me) to see if you could turn the BBC around and get the staff on the side of the management.\" Mr Dyke also said that the BBC should avoid the fall experienced by some of Britain's most successful businesses. \"The great fear at the BBC is 'don't be like Marks &amp; Spencer'.\" Mr Dyke was speaking at an event organised by the Media Trust to mark his first year as director general. He said that administration savings would continue to be made, and more money would be invested in programmes. He defended the ratings battle with ITV, and promised continued investment in the current affairs series Panorama. \"We may end up the only people doing that sort of thing,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p>Those familiar with the \"12-step\" programme know it as a treatment for drug addiction or alcoholism. But at a centre in north Wales, it is being used to tackle depression and a range of problems loosely described as emotional illness. </p> <p>The centre is called Tukes, after William Tukes, the 19th century health pioneer, and it was founded by Hilary Wheat, a mental health nurse. \"Through voluntary work, I came into contact with several recovering alcoholics, their family and friends, who had used the programme successfully,\" she says. \"At the same time, I was seeing people on acute psychiatric wards who were self-harming, and others who had depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and eating disorders - and it struck me that the 12-step approach could help them.\" </p> <p>Alcoholics Anonymous was the first 12-step programme. In the late 1930s, it was adapted to a clinical setting and subsequently became known as the Minnesota model, or the 12-step abstinence approach. It gives people a regime, helping them to put to one side their dependent behaviour and to learn to handle their feelings in a healthier way. </p> <p>\"People use self-harming, over- or under-eating or even compulsive shopping to manage their uncomfortable feelings and give them some sense of pleasure or relief, just as an alcoholic uses drinking, and in the same way, they become dependent on it,\" says 38-year-old Wheat. \"It's just different behaviour, but they are seeking the same temporary respite from their fears.\" </p> <p>In the early 1990s, Wheat, thoroughly disillusioned with the NHS, began to think seriously about establishing an independent treatment centre. \"The idea of leaving the NHS was daunting, but I couldn't carry on working in a situation where I felt we were often just maintaining people, when I believed effective change for them was possible. </p> <p>\"The psychiatric system is structured to deal with crises, but not structured to offer effective intervention to help someone manage their problems in the long term. It's down to a lack of training, lack of vision and, of course, lack of resources.\" </p> <p>She registered Tukes as a charity in 1994, but it took another four years of fundraising before the centre opened its doors in Aberystwyth, offering places to up to 12 clients. Today, it has three staff and is about to take on more. </p> <p>\"Some of the charities I approached wanted track records, but some thought it was a terrific idea,\" says Wheat. \"Like me, they were disillusioned with the services available on the NHS and saw we were offering something innovative.\" Her funders now also include the national lottery charities board and the health and social services department of the Welsh National Assembly, although the ultimate aim is to be self-funding through treatment fees. </p> <p>The majority of clients are paid for by the NHS or social services and referrals come from GPs, the voluntary sector and self-help groups, or direct from individuals themselves. As well as one-to-one counselling and group therapy, clients get the support of a peer group of other residents and their families are also offered assistance and support through the 16-week treatment period. </p> <p>Overall, Tukes's own monitoring indicates a high success rate with some 80% of clients remaining well after they leave. Those who have benefited include people who compulsively hoard food, are obsessive about cleaning or have irrational fears about contamination. Wheat is especially keen to stress the benefits - and cost-effectiveness - in treating depression, which costs the nation an estimated \u00a3370m a year in medication. </p> <p>Success is also claimed in treatment of people who self-harm. \"A woman who came to us for treatment for self-harming was asked by her psychologist to draw marks on her arm in red pen as a substitute for actual cutting and to help her cut less,\" recalls Wheat. \"The intention was to reduce the harm she was doing to herself, and it sounds like a good idea, but it doesn't help the person manage the feelings which lead to self-harming and it can also reinforce the belief that they can't stop. </p> <p>\"We tell people it's possible to stop, though they will feel uncomfortable. We encourage them to talk about the urge to cut, but not to act on it and they will get a lot of support from their peer group in the centre in managing this.\" </p> <p>Tukes is drug-free, although most of the people who are referred there have been prescribed anti-depressant or anxiolytic medication by their GPs or psychiatrists. \"Prozac and other anti-depressants alter people's moods to an extent,\" says Wheat, \"so we ask people to stop taking them so they can feel their feelings and learn to manage them, rather than having them reduced. It's also the case that some people will be taking more of the prescribed drug than they should and are using it in a dependent way.\" </p> <p>Fulfilment of her vision has, for Wheat, vindicated her decision to jump the NHS ship. \"Seeing the programme working, with people getting and staying well is great, and it's something I'd love to see taken up elsewhere,\" she says. \"It can offer long-term, cost-effective recovery to people whose behaviour is blighting their lives.\" </p> <p>Tukes is on 01970-625851</p>",

      "bodyText": "The BBC is to make way for more drama and entertainment on BBC1 by shifting its flagship arts series to BBC2, raising fears about the corporation's commitment to serious programming on the main channel. The transfer of Omnibus, after 34 years at its present home, signals the end of a regular arts strand on BBC1 as the channel battles to survive in the multi-channel world. Only a year ago, the BBC promised a regular slot for the series on BBC1. Omnibus's move is part of a wider shake-up of the BBC's arts programmes. The Review, BBC2's weekly arts show, returns to a late-night slot as part of Newsnight and will be retitled Newsnight Review. The corporation said yesterday it was the biggest investment in arts programmes for five years. Roly Keating, the controller of arts commissioning, denied the Omnibus move signalled the end of arts programmes on BBC1. Popular shows, including some editions of Omnibus, would continue to be screened on the main channel. \"We are absolutely committed to arts on BBC1,\" he said. But he added that more people watched BBC2 on Saturdays at 7pm, the new peak-time slot for Omnibus, than its floating late-night slot on BBC1. A BBC spokeswoman said: \"Because of the extra investment in BBC1, there is going to be an increase in entertainment and drama programming, although BBC1 will retain a commitment to arts programmes.\"",

Editor of Granada's Tonight show David Mannion, who worked with Mr Stewart-Smith at ITN, said he was always chasing the big guns. \"He was always a guy for the big story,\" he said. \"I remember literally bumping into him as we were running from opposite directions along the corridor. \"He was a hot-footer. If there was a big story, you wanted him around. He has a sharp sense of what matters.\" Although Mr Stewart-Smith was not a politics specialist at ITN, he had \"nous\" and an understanding for the subject. \"He has an astute sense of how the political world revolves,\" said Mr Mannion. Our media industry insider said: \"Charles is a consummate professional. He will represent clients from the strategic PR point of view, not a moralistic one.\" \"I would not categorise him as a straight PR man. He is very well-connected in politics, media, marketing, music and, as his involvement with Rock the Vote shows, he is someone who is engaged with issues. Issues drive him.\" Channel 4 head of press and publicity Matt Baker said: \"He is not just a PR man - he is well plugged in to the worlds of media and politics and that gives him a fine understanding to inform his PR work.\" He is also managing director of Pendragon Productions, the company's TV production business, and a founding trustee of both the European Children's Trust and Medical Emergency Relief International (Merlin).

      "bodyText": "The industry secretary, Stephen Byers, yesterday joined forces with the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, to assert Labour will make a decision whether to join a single currency early in the next parliament. Mr Byers, speaking at the Mansion House in London, insisted Labour's policy on the single currency \"has not been changed and will not change\". There have been reports recently that the chancellor, Gordon Brown, was seeking to add a sixth test to the five already set out by the government - that any referendum on joining the euro would have to be won by a large majority. The story was denied by the Treasury, but it appeared to alarm some businessmen and cabinet members concerned that the resignation from the cabinet of Peter Mandelson, a fervent pro-European, would weaken the government's resolve about joining the euro. Mr Byers' remarks yesterday were designed to reassure British business that the pro-European alliance inside the cabinet will not allow the policy to be altered. One minister said that the pro-Europeans were probably becoming more confident following the recent rise in the euro and clear statements from senior executives at Ford, Nissan and implicitly at Corus that they will take investment out of Britain if the government rules out joining the single currency. In his speech Mr Byers said: \"It is a policy which is understood by business. Had we ruled out joining then investment decisions which have recently been made would not have been taken in favour of the UK.\" The chancellor has refused to provide what he describes as a running commentary on whether the British economy is closer to meeting the tests, including sustainable convergence between Britain's economy and the economies of the single currency. However, Tony Blair told a meeting of Labour activists in Kettering last week that the most important test was whether \"our economy is marching in step with the other mainland economies\". As Mr Byers rallied to the pro-single currency cause - and a poll reported that 76% of London's senior executives favour early UK entry into the eurozone - John Redwood launched a new Conservative drive in the opposite direction. Britain should copy its European partners in their eternal demands for renegotiation of the EU treaties in search of \"ever closer union,\" he said, except that Mr Blair should demand just the opposite, a deal which recognises that the UK will never go as far as Europe wants \"no matter who is prime minister\". \"They have constant renegotiation, so why can't Britain? They want more, we want less,\" the former Tory cabinet minister said at the launch of a book, Stars and Strife, the Coming Conflict, which advocates UK membership of the US-led Nafta trade bloc as well as of the EU. Mr Redwood, who is to the right of William Hague on Europe, wants to repatriate policy over fishing, farming and overseas aid, and blames Europe, not the US, for disputes on the environment, the nuclear shield, and GM crops. \"The US used to think more European integration was a good thing. Now the US has discovered it just means making a never-ending series of disagreeable phone calls and a growing detachment of the EU from Anglo-Saxon democratic values,\" he complained.",

      "bodyText": "Alphameric, the retail and leisure IT provider, yesterday admitted there had been teething problems with its electronic gambling technology during trials in a number of betting shops, but said that it would get its equipment to bookies on time. Chief executive Alan Morcombe said the roll-out of Alphameric's Alphabet bet capturing technology, which allows bookmakers to register bets and calculate risk exposures across the country in real time, had been delayed by six months but was now proceeding without problem. Bookmakers taking up the technology include Coral, Stanley Leisure and the Tote, with William Hill also showing an interest. Alphabet is seen as central to Alphameric's growth as bookmaking becomes increasingly computerised. Mr Morcombe said: \"There were delays [in the roll-out] for a number of reasons - the trials threw up some software bugs that had to be ironed out, and training betting shop staff to use the system took longer than expected in some cases.\" About 45% of Alphameric's business is with bookmakers. Mr Morcombe said it would be considering acquisitions in the US and Europe. His comments accompanied Alphameric's results for the year to December 2000, which showed operating profits before exceptionals in line with expectations - up 162% to \u00a38m on turnover up 115% to \u00a354.4m.

      "body": "<p>Sometimes there is no right answer, there is only better and worse. Nothing currently said or done about asylum seekers is good, though it could be worse (some European countries are far tougher on refugees). Very little honesty is spoken about it: Labour's pollsters warn them it is a wicked issue with voters, Tory politicians use it wickedly. \"Bogus\" and \"abusive\" is what politicians call migrants, but bogus and abusive better describes the way most politicians talk.</p> <p>Jack Straw's plan for protecting Europe from the hordes of the world's poor is starting to take shape. In Stockholm on Friday he will be among the European interior ministers debating how best to form a common EU policy. It plainly makes no sense for the French to allow a camp at Calais of would-be stowaways to Dover, refusing to take them back if Britain tries to return them, claiming they should go instead to wherever they first entered the EU - which can never be proved. Each country has its own immigration angst.</p> <p>The Straw plan envisages camps set up in neighbouring third countries. Afghans fleeing the Taliban, for example, would stay in Pakistan. Pakistan would be paid by the EU or UN to run camps that would process them: those accepted as genuine refugees would then be assigned to western nations according to quota, as happened in Kosovo. The advantage for Europe is that anyone arriving by any other route could be turned round at port and sent right back to these camps. Few would risk their savings on a terrifying illegal journey only to be sent straight back to the region on arrival. At last, says Straw somewhat disingenuously, this would be a system that makes sense, since not even genuine asylum seekers can currently arrive here legally.</p> <p>It sounds neat, but this is a looking-glass world where nothing is what it seems, no figures are what they pretend and the law is an ass. What we will see in Stockholm is fortress Europe tugging on the drawbridge to stop waves of migration that can only increase every year. One way or another it has to be done: if it is not done by social democratic governments with at least some semblance of decency it will be done by the Haiders and the Berlusconis far more savagely, sweeping to power on the back of this very issue.</p> <p>It puts all liberals into a deep quandary. Few genuinely think there could (even should) be a totally open immigration policy into Europe, but understandably squirm at every alternative: the process of keeping the third world out will always be unpleasant and essentially racist. This is the sharp edge of the world's injustice where the faces of the poor appear on our own doorsteps. Eyeball to eyeball we push them back to a poverty only seen on television. Western human rights ideals look shabby when making nice distinctions between those in danger of persecution and those only risking starvation. But until the west converts to global egalitarianism, that is the way it is. Nasty.</p> <p>Seventy-five thousand people claimed asylum last year - up from 35,000 in 1997. The backlog of old cases stands at 66,000. The government tosses figures around cavalierly - Straw was at it again in yesterday's speech - but they rarely are what they seem. For example, he said 80% of asylum seekers are refused. (The rest are the \"abusive\" poor).</p> <p>First of all, \"refused\" is a term of art. The system requires applicants dumped on God-forsaken sink estates to fill out a 20-page form in English, without a lawyer, within 14 days. If they fail to do it correctly they are deemed \"non-compliant\" and automatically refused asylum. There are seven days to appeal on another form, in English; most fail - or not. The Home Office triumphantly declares to the press that most are refused. But that's all a technicality, they are not actually sent back. That is not the end of the story. This arbitrary cruelty is all for show. Last year only some 8,000 people were actually deported.</p> <p>The fact is that almost all people who make it to these shores end up staying. It is practically impossible to send most of them back because there is no \"back\". Large numbers of Chinese, Filipinos and others have no documents and their embassies will not accept their nationality. (Some countries rely on the foreign money earned and sent home.) Other applicants wait so long to have their cases resolved it becomes impossible to remove them - long married with many children, settled with good jobs and employers who want to keep them. Many slip away and vanish.</p> <p>Most of the world's refugees are already camped on the borders of their own countries - the poorest nations forced to cope with the great exoduses caused by war-driven famine. According to Professor Guy Gordon-Gill, Oxford professor of international refugee law, only 0.3% of global refugees ever get anywhere near the EU: only the relatively rich or remarkably resourceful make it, so we need not fear a vast expansion of numbers. Keeping more of them in camps will do nothing to stop the criminal gangs bringing in illegals from China or eastern Europe. Nor will it become any easier to return them. Many will come, many will stay. There is no final solution.</p> <p>A recent UN population study predicts that in the next generation Italy will lose 28% of its population, Estonia 33% and Germany 25%. Already Europe is heavily dependent on unknown battalions of illegals who cook, clean and heave rubbish in the cities, pick and dig East Anglian fields. Illegals who disappear into the fabric of countries are no problem. The worst problems are caused by trying to contain them: for six months on vouchers they are kept in expensive, festering hell-holes, prevented from working though willing to do the worst jobs for the least pay. After that, they will make their own way and assimilate. So why bother?</p> <p>The Tory plan to lock up all 75,000 migrants and asylum seekers in detention centres indefinitely defies belief. What will happen to those who are not refugees but without papers can never be sent back? Will they stay there for ever? To imprison 60,000 a year would cost \u00a32bn to set up and \u00a31bn in running costs. (Figures not yet in Portillo's tax-spend plan.) Even if the government processed cases faster and the Home Office's catastrophic failure of administration were put right, most migrants could probably still not be deported.</p> <p>Both Jack Straw and Anne Widdecombe talk through their hat when they each propose new systems that will prevent/deter/end migration. Most asylum seekers come from the poorest most war-torn places - Somalia, Iraq, Iran and Sri Lanka. In the long run, the gradual spread of democracy and peace, solving problems at source - as in Sierra Leone - will be the only solution.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes there is no right answer, there is only better and worse. Nothing currently said or done about asylum seekers is good, though it could be worse (some European countries are far tougher on refugees). Very little honesty is spoken about it: Labour's pollsters warn them it is a wicked issue with voters, Tory politicians use it wickedly. \"Bogus\" and \"abusive\" is what politicians call migrants, but bogus and abusive better describes the way most politicians talk. Jack Straw's plan for protecting Europe from the hordes of the world's poor is starting to take shape. In Stockholm on Friday he will be among the European interior ministers debating how best to form a common EU policy. It plainly makes no sense for the French to allow a camp at Calais of would-be stowaways to Dover, refusing to take them back if Britain tries to return them, claiming they should go instead to wherever they first entered the EU - which can never be proved. Each country has its own immigration angst. The Straw plan envisages camps set up in neighbouring third countries. Afghans fleeing the Taliban, for example, would stay in Pakistan. Pakistan would be paid by the EU or UN to run camps that would process them: those accepted as genuine refugees would then be assigned to western nations according to quota, as happened in Kosovo. The advantage for Europe is that anyone arriving by any other route could be turned round at port and sent right back to these camps. Few would risk their savings on a terrifying illegal journey only to be sent straight back to the region on arrival. At last, says Straw somewhat disingenuously, this would be a system that makes sense, since not even genuine asylum seekers can currently arrive here legally. It sounds neat, but this is a looking-glass world where nothing is what it seems, no figures are what they pretend and the law is an ass. What we will see in Stockholm is fortress Europe tugging on the drawbridge to stop waves of migration that can only increase every year. One way or another it has to be done: if it is not done by social democratic governments with at least some semblance of decency it will be done by the Haiders and the Berlusconis far more savagely, sweeping to power on the back of this very issue. It puts all liberals into a deep quandary. Few genuinely think there could (even should) be a totally open immigration policy into Europe, but understandably squirm at every alternative: the process of keeping the third world out will always be unpleasant and essentially racist. This is the sharp edge of the world's injustice where the faces of the poor appear on our own doorsteps. Eyeball to eyeball we push them back to a poverty only seen on television. Western human rights ideals look shabby when making nice distinctions between those in danger of persecution and those only risking starvation. But until the west converts to global egalitarianism, that is the way it is. Nasty. Seventy-five thousand people claimed asylum last year - up from 35,000 in 1997. The backlog of old cases stands at 66,000. The government tosses figures around cavalierly - Straw was at it again in yesterday's speech - but they rarely are what they seem. For example, he said 80% of asylum seekers are refused. (The rest are the \"abusive\" poor). First of all, \"refused\" is a term of art. The system requires applicants dumped on God-forsaken sink estates to fill out a 20-page form in English, without a lawyer, within 14 days. If they fail to do it correctly they are deemed \"non-compliant\" and automatically refused asylum. There are seven days to appeal on another form, in English; most fail - or not. The Home Office triumphantly declares to the press that most are refused. But that's all a technicality, they are not actually sent back. That is not the end of the story. This arbitrary cruelty is all for show. Last year only some 8,000 people were actually deported. The fact is that almost all people who make it to these shores end up staying. It is practically impossible to send most of them back because there is no \"back\". Large numbers of Chinese, Filipinos and others have no documents and their embassies will not accept their nationality. (Some countries rely on the foreign money earned and sent home.) Other applicants wait so long to have their cases resolved it becomes impossible to remove them - long married with many children, settled with good jobs and employers who want to keep them. Many slip away and vanish. Most of the world's refugees are already camped on the borders of their own countries - the poorest nations forced to cope with the great exoduses caused by war-driven famine. According to Professor Guy Gordon-Gill, Oxford professor of international refugee law, only 0.3% of global refugees ever get anywhere near the EU: only the relatively rich or remarkably resourceful make it, so we need not fear a vast expansion of numbers. Keeping more of them in camps will do nothing to stop the criminal gangs bringing in illegals from China or eastern Europe. Nor will it become any easier to return them. Many will come, many will stay. There is no final solution. A recent UN population study predicts that in the next generation Italy will lose 28% of its population, Estonia 33% and Germany 25%. Already Europe is heavily dependent on unknown battalions of illegals who cook, clean and heave rubbish in the cities, pick and dig East Anglian fields. Illegals who disappear into the fabric of countries are no problem. The worst problems are caused by trying to contain them: for six months on vouchers they are kept in expensive, festering hell-holes, prevented from working though willing to do the worst jobs for the least pay. After that, they will make their own way and assimilate. So why bother? The Tory plan to lock up all 75,000 migrants and asylum seekers in detention centres indefinitely defies belief. What will happen to those who are not refugees but without papers can never be sent back? Will they stay there for ever? To imprison 60,000 a year would cost \u00a32bn to set up and \u00a31bn in running costs. (Figures not yet in Portillo's tax-spend plan.) Even if the government processed cases faster and the Home Office's catastrophic failure of administration were put right, most migrants could probably still not be deported. Both Jack Straw and Anne Widdecombe talk through their hat when they each propose new systems that will prevent/deter/end migration. Most asylum seekers come from the poorest most war-torn places - Somalia, Iraq, Iran and Sri Lanka. In the long run, the gradual spread of democracy and peace, solving problems at source - as in Sierra Leone - will be the only solution. How Britain can be rejecting Iraqis as genuine refugees while still bombing their dictator is unclear. But that is just another bizarre example of an impossible policy that can never be right. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com Related articles How to claim asylum An A-Z of asylum seekers The main parties' positions on asylum seekers 06.02.2001: Straw wants to toughen asylum rules 04.02.2001: Tony Blair and Italian counterpart Guiliano Amato write for the Observer 06.02.2001: Asylum seekers to be 'sent back' 05.02.2001: Grim war on human traffickers 28.01.2001: Bosnia's corrupt elite grow fat on human cargo smuggled to West 28.01.2001: People trade makes Bosnia rich Interactive guide Seeking asylum: who, where and why?

This will not happen - cannot happen - if the foundation of all nuclear arms control agreements, the 1972 ABM treaty, is abrogated by the US. All constructive efforts to reduce weapons will end.

Such an upgrade would make the UK a willing abettor in America's abrogation of the ABM treaty, as well as create a major nuclear target on British soil. There is also the near certainty that in domestic political terms Fylingdales will become the new Greenham Common.

      "bodyText": "The Australian government was accused yesterday of pandering to global pharmaceutical companies after a former industry lobbyist was appointed to what is supposed to be an independent prescription drug watchdog. Eleven health professionals quit the 13-person Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) when a government shakeup of the panel led to the appointment of Pat Clear, a former head of the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association, and a Glaxo-Wellcome executive. Mr Clear was given the position despite a government review of the PBAC last year which concluded that any appointment of drug industry representatives would be \"untenable\". \"They've cut our balls off,\" said Don Birkett, who resigned as PBAC chairman. \"To put someone like that on the committee is handing over our national decision-making capacity to the pharmaceutical industry. It's a clear and obvious conflict of interest.\" The PBAC decides which prescription drugs qualify for a portion of the A$3.2bn (\u00a31.2bn) annual public subsidy under Australia's pharmaceutical benefits system (PBS), which regulates prices for consumers. The federal health minister, Michael Wooldridge, denied there was a conflict of interest, stressing that Mr Clear had retired from the drug manufacturers' association last year. \"It is entirely appropriate for a person with previous industry experience to be a member of this committee,\" he said. The PBAC is a model for regulatory systems worldwide - Britain's National Institute for Clinical Excellence is one of its counterparts, and was the first watchdog to demand cost-effectiveness from pharmaceutical companies, forcing them to justify their prices for prescription drugs on wider grounds than just their cost of manufacture. The International Union of Pharmacology, which advises the UN and the World Health Organisation, has written to Canberra in protest at the appointment of Mr Clear. The union's delegate to the WHO told the Australian government: \"Please consider that Australia is a model for drug use in developing countries which, until now, have had a chaotic drug market.\" David Henry, who was forced off the committee during the recent shakeup, said: \"There is now the possibility that the spiralling cost of the pharmaceutical benefits system will get passed on to the public, who will have to pay more for their drugs. \"As soon as you do that, it's inequitable,\" he said. \"The people who need the drugs most will be the least able to afford it.\" Several former panel members alleged that drug companies have been trying to undermine the committee for some time because of the power it has to shape the prescription drug market in the country and to keep prices down. Last year the panel was taken to the Australian federal court by a US pharmaceutical giant, Pfizer, after refusing to approve a subsidy for its product, Viagra. The male potency drug costs A$70 (\u00a326) for four tablets but with a state subsidy, it could have cost people as little as A$3.30, netting Pfizer millions in increased sales. The company lost the initial hearing. Professor Henry said: \"Now we'll have the situation where the next company which takes the committee to court will have somebody on the committee who can tell them exactly what the committee is thinking about the forthcoming court case.\" Only two of the new committee members appointed by the health minister in the shakeup have previous experience on the panel. This, Professor Birkett says, \"has caused all the experience and expertise and corporate memory to disappear\".",

After a lengthy review, involving a court case, Camelot's licence was renewed for another seven years. Gerald Kaufman, the veteran Labour chairman of the select committee, said he saw no problem with government-run lotteries after visiting the United States, where two-thirds of lotteries are run by state authorities. \"Here we have a Labour government that is less socialist than republicans in the US,\" Mr Kaufman said. Conscious of the sensitivity of talking about nationalisation, Mr Smith insisted that he was \"agnostic\" about whether the government should take over the lottery. He added that the government's painful experience of the Millennium Dome would make ministers cautious.",

Useless, then, to repeat like a parrot, that war is not inevitable: war is now quite inevitable unless we make an almost superhuman effort, of a new and more positive kind, to prevent it.</p> <p>I suggest a two-point programme. First, the proposed conference with Russia, which has been hanging about as if we had eternity at our disposal and now looks like being held up (if it comes off at all) for heaven knows how many further exchanges, should be pressed on with as if our lives depended on its immediate convening ...</p> <p>Manoeuvring for position, warfare by \"Notes\", all should be thrown overboard: we just have not time for them ...</p> <p>The great thing is to get together on anybody's ground and then make a desperate effort to widen things out and achieve agreement. But now comes the crux: however certain our statesmen may be - and I share their certainty - that the Kremlin is primarily responsible for our present disasters, we must yet negotiate, as Mr Nehru has urged, not in the mood of war, but in the mood of peace.</p> <p>Nothing could be harder, but if we can make so vast an effort to rearm materially, cannot we make a comparable effort to disarm spiritually, to subdue our passions? And I suggest that apart from this particular conference with Russia, we should always and everywhere substitute human negotiations face to face for long-range paper warfare.</p> <p>Secondly, we should take the initiative in proposing for immediate discussion some variant of the plan already proposed by Walther Reuther [a US labour leader active in world affairs], namely that a great international fund should be established, as an urgent matter of life or death, for improving the conditions of those fellow human beings who, to the number of hundreds of millions, are starving, destitute and in despair.</p> <p>I should like to see our own country, by the size of its proposed contribution, challenging the world to a new kind of rivalry, a rivalry in the works of peace.</p> <p>So might international dis cussion, leading to international administration, find itself with a fruitful topic instead of a sterile one.</p> <p>So might the trend to war, issuing from a concentration on national as opposed to international interests, be reversed. So at last might swords be turned into ploughshares.</p> <p>May I ask through you, Sir, that all who are in agreement with this letter should send a postcard with just the word \"Yes\" and their name and address to me at 14 Henrietta Street, London WC2.</p> <p>I do not guarantee any action of any kind, but if the response is large enough something might possibly come of it.</p> <p>Yours, Victor Gollancz</p> <p>14 Henrietta Street</p> <p>London WC2</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.waronwant.org  \" target=\"_NEW\">www.waronwant.org </a></p>",

Every day now our minds are being more completely conditioned: the \"hell bomb\" is the latest attraction in the Sunday press, and Amiel, whom not one Englishman in ten thousand has ever heard of, is brought on from the grave to warn us that long before \"The Hun\" invaded Belguim, \"the Russians\" were barbarians. It is impossible to exaggerate the deterioration even during the last two months. Useless, then, to repeat like a parrot, that war is not inevitable: war is now quite inevitable unless we make an almost superhuman effort, of a new and more positive kind, to prevent it. I suggest a two-point programme. First, the proposed conference with Russia, which has been hanging about as if we had eternity at our disposal and now looks like being held up (if it comes off at all) for heaven knows how many further exchanges, should be pressed on with as if our lives depended on its immediate convening ... Manoeuvring for position, warfare by \"Notes\", all should be thrown overboard: we just have not time for them ... The great thing is to get together on anybody's ground and then make a desperate effort to widen things out and achieve agreement. But now comes the crux: however certain our statesmen may be - and I share their certainty - that the Kremlin is primarily responsible for our present disasters, we must yet negotiate, as Mr Nehru has urged, not in the mood of war, but in the mood of peace. Nothing could be harder, but if we can make so vast an effort to rearm materially, cannot we make a comparable effort to disarm spiritually, to subdue our passions? And I suggest that apart from this particular conference with Russia, we should always and everywhere substitute human negotiations face to face for long-range paper warfare. Secondly, we should take the initiative in proposing for immediate discussion some variant of the plan already proposed by Walther Reuther [a US labour leader active in world affairs], namely that a great international fund should be established, as an urgent matter of life or death, for improving the conditions of those fellow human beings who, to the number of hundreds of millions, are starving, destitute and in despair. I should like to see our own country, by the size of its proposed contribution, challenging the world to a new kind of rivalry, a rivalry in the works of peace. So might international dis cussion, leading to international administration, find itself with a fruitful topic instead of a sterile one. So might the trend to war, issuing from a concentration on national as opposed to international interests, be reversed. So at last might swords be turned into ploughshares. May I ask through you, Sir, that all who are in agreement with this letter should send a postcard with just the word \"Yes\" and their name and address to me at 14 Henrietta Street, London WC2. I do not guarantee any action of any kind, but if the response is large enough something might possibly come of it. Yours, Victor Gollancz 14 Henrietta Street London WC2 www.waronwant.org",

War on Want emerged from the ensuing debate. From the start the organisation focused on changing public policy to make combating global poverty a priority. One of its first acts was to mobilise the British people to press the government to allocate 1% of GDP to development overseas - a level of funding yet to be reached. As early as 1961 the charity pointed out that most British aid consisted of loans that would end up as unpayable debts. \"If the proportion of loans in our aid is not reduced,\" it said, \"we are heading for trouble\". War on Want also pressed for greater priority to be given to aid programmes, and in 1964 the Labour prime minister, Harold Wilson - a founding member - created the Ministry of Overseas Development. The first minister was Barbara Castle, an early patron of the charity. War on Want's first overseas task was helping refugees from the war against the French colonialists in Algeria. It also gave financial support to the Bhoodan movement in India, which was trying in the 1960s to realise Gandhi's dream of a village-based development. In the 1970s it helped to expose the scandal of manufacturers such as Nestle aggressively promoting the sale of milk powder for babies at the expense of breastfeeding. It also campaigned for tea workers' rights in Asia. In the Thatcher years, when many young people turned to international liberation movements as an outlet for their radical impulses, it was in the vanguard of the international solidarity movement, led by its general secretary, George Galloway, now a Glasgow MP. It became a target of the right. Complaints were made to the Charity Commission, which censured it for its headline-grabbing advertisements against apartheid and the US involvement in Nicaragua. John Denham, now a Labour health minister, spearheaded with others a campaign called Profits out of Poverty, which has been credited with bringing the debt crisis in underdeveloped countries to public attention. In the same period a Women for a Change campaign led others to recognise the critical role of women in fighting world poverty. In the late 1980s War on Want nearly went bankrupt when inadequate financial management resulting in funds for overseas projects being mixed with general funds. It later won a substantial out-of-court settlement from its auditors, Somers Baker, for the damage caused to its reputation and income. The experience led to a revision of accounting procedures for all charities. War on Want is leaner now, with 20 staff and volunteers and an annual turnover of around \u00a31.4m. Its drive to get pension funds to invest ethically has brought positive results: the Labour government now requires firms to say whether they take account of social and ethical issues. The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, and the resulting increase in poverty, led War on Want to take up the banner against currency speculators and it is now a leading advocate of the Tobin Tax - a proposal to calm markets and raise money for development by levying a tiny tax on currency markets. On its first leaflet War on Want wrote that closing the gap between the rich and the poor of the earth was \"the supreme challenge of the next 50 years\". So it remains, but the additional challenges set by globalisation has moved the same campaigns against world poverty on to a new battleground. www.waronwant.org Mark Luetchford is a trustee of War on Want and is writing its history",

      "body": "<p>The Home Office faces a compensation bill which could reach millions of pounds for wrongly jailing asylum seekers for travelling on false passports.</p> <p>Thousands were imprisoned between 1994 and 1999, when the high court ruled that jailing asylum seekers for travelling on false documents breached the 1951 Geneva convention on the the status of refugees.</p> <p>The Home Office would only confirm that it had received a number of applications, but it will have to compensate those who apply under its ex-gratia scheme which pays out in cases of serious default, or where an accused person is completely exonerated.</p> <p>Solicitors expect payment of at least \u00a310,000 for the typical case in which the courts imposed a six-month sentence. Some were sentenced to nine months, and a few to a year.</p> <p>Between 500 and 1,000 are thought to have been prosecuted each year between 1994, when prosecutions were stepped up, and the high court judgment in 1999. Most were attempting to pass through the UK on forged passports en route to the US or Canada.</p> <p>The judgment came in a test case brought by three asylum seekers, two of whom had served six months. The third was being threatened with prosecution for using false papers, even though the home secretary had since granted him indefinite leave to stay.</p> <p>The two judges delivered a strong rebuke to the home secretary, Jack Straw, and the crown prosecution service for ignoring Britain's obligations under the convention.</p> <p>Lord Justice Simon Brown said no one in the criminal justice system, including the CPS and defence solicitors, had given \"the least thought\" to article 31 of the convention, which states that asylum seekers should not be penalised for entering a country illegally.</p> <p>He said the combination of visa requirements and carrier's liability, which imposes heavy penalties for conveying passengers without documentation, \"has made it well nigh impossible for refugees to travel to countries of refuge without false documents\".</p> <p>Most of those who were convicted had been arrested on arrival and brought before magistrates the next day. Typically, they had pleaded guilty after duty solicitors told them they had no defence and would get a shorter sentence for a guilty plea.</p> <p>Patrick Allen, senior partner of north London solicitors Hodge Jones &amp; Allen, represents a couple from Kosovo who have had their compensation claims accepted by the Home Office. He said: \"Many asylum seekers and refugees have been wrongly prosecuted and imprisoned for travelling with false documents.

      "bodyText": "The Home Office faces a compensation bill which could reach millions of pounds for wrongly jailing asylum seekers for travelling on false passports. Thousands were imprisoned between 1994 and 1999, when the high court ruled that jailing asylum seekers for travelling on false documents breached the 1951 Geneva convention on the the status of refugees. The Home Office would only confirm that it had received a number of applications, but it will have to compensate those who apply under its ex-gratia scheme which pays out in cases of serious default, or where an accused person is completely exonerated. Solicitors expect payment of at least \u00a310,000 for the typical case in which the courts imposed a six-month sentence. Some were sentenced to nine months, and a few to a year. Between 500 and 1,000 are thought to have been prosecuted each year between 1994, when prosecutions were stepped up, and the high court judgment in 1999. Most were attempting to pass through the UK on forged passports en route to the US or Canada. The judgment came in a test case brought by three asylum seekers, two of whom had served six months. The third was being threatened with prosecution for using false papers, even though the home secretary had since granted him indefinite leave to stay. The two judges delivered a strong rebuke to the home secretary, Jack Straw, and the crown prosecution service for ignoring Britain's obligations under the convention. Lord Justice Simon Brown said no one in the criminal justice system, including the CPS and defence solicitors, had given \"the least thought\" to article 31 of the convention, which states that asylum seekers should not be penalised for entering a country illegally. He said the combination of visa requirements and carrier's liability, which imposes heavy penalties for conveying passengers without documentation, \"has made it well nigh impossible for refugees to travel to countries of refuge without false documents\". Most of those who were convicted had been arrested on arrival and brought before magistrates the next day. Typically, they had pleaded guilty after duty solicitors told them they had no defence and would get a shorter sentence for a guilty plea. Patrick Allen, senior partner of north London solicitors Hodge Jones &amp; Allen, represents a couple from Kosovo who have had their compensation claims accepted by the Home Office. He said: \"Many asylum seekers and refugees have been wrongly prosecuted and imprisoned for travelling with false documents. They will be entitled to compensation and the bill for the Home Office could be enormous.\" The Kosovan couple arrived at Heathrow en route for Canada in February 1999 using false Greek passports. They were both convicted the following day and sentenced to six months in prison. The pair are now applying for asylum in Britain.

      "bodyText": "A farming family lost their claim to 57 acres of potential development land yesterday. Caroline Graham and her father Charles Denton had won a ruling in the high court last year that the land, which could be worth millions of pounds, was theirs because a property development company had not evicted them for 12 years while they farmed it. But yesterday the court of appeal overturned the ruling because the farmers had never shown an intention to dispossess the property company and claim squatters' rights. Lord Justice Mummery said there was \"credible and uncontradicted evidence from the squatters' themselves\" that they did not intend to possess but hoped to reach an agreement to use the land. The company, JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd, had taken no steps to evict the family from the land next to their farm, Henwick Manor, Thatcham, near Newbury, Berkshire, from 1984 while they negotiated with planners to build houses there. In the high court Mr Justice Neuberger granted permission for the company to take the case to the court of appeal. JA Pye bought the manor and land in 1975 but sold most of it two years later, keeping the disputed acres because of the development potential. In 1982, John Graham bought the farm at auction for his son, Michael, who married Caroline in 1987, and farmed it until the son died in 1998. The company had granted grazing rights to the family but correspondence ceased in 1985 and the Grahams continued to use it without permission. Kim Lewison QC, representing the farmers, was refused permission to take the case to the Lords. JA Pye is not claiming legal costs for the appeal but the farmers face high court costs estimated at \u00a3200,000. Press Association",

He then reverses the charges on calls to his father 10 times a day and tells him where to invest. While a prisoner cannot profit from his crimes by writing about them, there is nothing to stop him making money legally while inside. Mathie has bought a house for his family in Long Island and purchased four cars, including a $97,000 Dodge Viper, although the pleasures of owning a high-performance vehicle while in a high-security jail are limited. He has also made a handsome donation to a charity for young offenders and gives free investment advice throughout the prison. \"It runs the whole gamut, from lawyers to inmates to everybody,\" he told the New York Times. Among Mathie's coups has been the $150,000 he made in less than three hours by investing in China Prosperity International Holdings as the World Trade Organisation discussed admitting China. Although The Investor of Elmira Correctional Facility does not have quite the same ring to it as The Birdman of Alcatraz, a film deal surely cannot be far behind.",

      "body": "<p>Designers Lucienne and Robin Day are taking a turn round the Barbican's retrospective of their work. There are chairs designed by Robin everywhere, so many that we can't decide on a place to sit. Pressed-steel benches from the London Underground, a seat from the auditorium of the Royal Festival Hall, the chairs used in hospital waiting rooms: they all compete for the designers' attention. </p> <p>The Days choose to sit in one of Robin's classic 1960s polypropylene chairs and a leather-upholstered Forum sofa, like the ones they had in their Chelsea house for decades, before they moved to Sussex last year. Robin is 85 years old, Lucienne is 84; they have been married since 1942. They still look much as they did in the early 1950s, when Robin was building a career as a furniture designer and Lucienne was in the process of changing the taste of a nation with her witty, abstract, printed fabrics. </p> <p>Over 60 years in design, they have seldom worked together, but their careers have run in parallel. As soon as they met at London's Royal College of Art, says Robin, they knew they were kindred spirits. \"We were both keen to make careers out of designing for industry - most of our contemporaries went in to teaching. As our careers progressed we were each able to get an honest opinion from the other about our work - without being polite. We could say what we thought, that it was bloody awful or whatever.\" </p> <p>The Days were also drawn to each other by a shared sense of purpose and principle. Their commitment to designing low-cost, mass-produced, good-quality furniture and fabric was politically motivated, prompted by the needs of postwar society. \"If you have any social conscience at all you can't remain an elitist and work just for the few,\" says Robin. \"Good design should - and I still believe this - enhance people's quality of life. I suppose that's a fairly vain thing to say. But that's what we thought.\" </p> <p>\"It came from our political beliefs,\" adds Lucienne. \"We believed in democracy. And, well, the Labour party.\" </p> <p>A key moment in both their careers was the Festival of Britain in 1951. Robin had already made a mark - he had won, with his friend Clive Latimer, a competition to design low-cost furniture run by New York's Museum of Modern Art. For the Festival of Britain, he was invited to contribute two room sets to the Homes and Gardens pavilion, the theme of which was space-saving. Meanwhile Lucienne had prepared a furnishing fabric called Calyx for the pavilion. It was an exceptionally large and bold repeat pattern of abstracted flowers, the petals simplified to Miro-esque cup shapes. Defiantly modern and modishly dynamic, it was nothing like the chintzy florals or drab utility fabrics that had been dominant in Britain till then. </p> <p>Along with Robin's sleek, simple furniture, Calyx launched an era in British design that translated European modernism into a contemporary style imbued with postwar optimism, colour and playfulness. At the time, says Lucienne, she had no idea what effect the fabric would have. \"There were good modern fabrics around, but they were mostly woven fabrics, terribly expensive, not prints. Robin wanted something that the ordinary man or woman in the street could buy. I took the fabric to Heal's to be made, where I had a contact. They said, 'We shan't sell any of this.' But they did - it was instantly a great success.\" </p> <p>In 1958, Heal's mounted a solo show of her work, which encompassed not only fabric but wallpaper and ceramics designs. She had gone some way to achieving one of her aims: that designers should be recognised by name for their work. During that decade, Lucienne couldn't put a foot wrong - her work had an originality and energy that still looks startlingly fresh. Designs such as the witty Spectators, in which abstracted, spindly Giacometti-like figures turn out to be cheekily sporting spectacles, are virtuosic in their handling of colour and pattern. The Days became something of a celebrity couple. Their Chelsea house was photographed by stylish interiors magazines. They even posed for a Smirnoff ad in the mid-1950s. They were Britain's answer to the US's famed husband-and-wife design team, Charles and Ray Eames. </p> <p>You can almost see the sense of principle in Robin's furniture. His pieces are always economical, in use of materials as well as production costs. There is no trickery or artifice, let alone any frippery or flippancy. \"I like to see structure clearly expressed and materials expressing their own character,\" says Robin. \"I don't like to see a massive piece of furniture with upholstery concealing some kind of timber framing, and with tiny little feet emerging from it in some mysterious way.\" </p> <p>In the 1950s furniture design had certain clear challenges to meet; what does he think the challenges are today? \"I think that we are part of a pretty affluent society,\" he says, \"and that the important things are to conserve material and energy and make things that will endure and can be recycled. It's all very well talking about good design. But it can also be dangerous. There are things that are needed; but also a lot of rubbish that is foisted upon the public in the guise of fashion.\" </p> <p>The early work of the Days is supremely fashionable now - a reissue of Robin's polypropylene armchair is currently walking out of Habitat stores, while fabric influenced by Lucienne's 1950s work is everywhere. \"It gives me a great deal of pleasure,\" says Robin, \"that the idioms that one had all those years ago are still valid and still thought to be OK - that they perhaps have some intrinsic merit.\" </p> <p>But there's no time for resting on laurels, for Robin at least. While Lucienne has recently stopped making the fine handworked silk mosaics that have been her main output for the past 20 years, Robin is not slowing down. \"If you've been designing for 60 years you - at least I - can't suddenly just stop. One is always looking at things, finding solutions to things. And yes, when I sit on a chair I do find myself analysing it. It's a sort of habit. An obsession.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Robin and Lucienne Day: Pioneers of Contemporary Design is at the Barbican Gallery, London EC2 (020-7638 8891), from tomorrow until April 16.

      "body": "<p>If Michael Grandage were a car, he'd be a sporty number, the kind that goes from 0-60mph in seconds. Grandage's career as a director has gone from standstill to fast lane in what seems like the blink of an eye. </p> <p>Five years ago Grandage was a frustrated actor in his early 30s who didn't feel he was making the transition from good-looking lead to the meatier roles that sustain older actors. He was also becoming less interested in his characters and more absorbed in the process of putting on plays. So he changed careers. </p> <p>Now he is a regular director at the Almeida, associate director at the Donmar, where his brilliant Merrily We Roll Along is pulling in the crowds, and associate director at Sheffield Theatres. It is this mixture of metropolitan glamour and provincial clout that has made Grandage a serious contender to run the National Theatre if and when Trevor Nunn vacates the seat. That, and the fact that Grandage is a great director of the classics with a sharp eye for new writing. </p> <p>And he can do it on a grand scale. There is a world of difference between the intimate 250-seater Donmar and the 900-seater Sheffield Crucible, whose vast thrust stage is as daunting as a football pitch to directors weaned on studio spaces. But Grandage loves the grand scale and his irresistible As You Like It, with Victoria Hamilton as Rosalind, has already won this year's South Bank Show theatre award. Then, in Simon Bent's Accomplices, a story of violence on a northern housing estate, Grandage not only snaffled the best new play of the year but also dared to put it on in the biggest space available. </p> <p>Though the Crucible stage proved unforgiving for the largely interior drama of the Restoration comedy The Country Wife, Grandage is determined to stretch the boundaries of the classical repertoire and make modern writers aware that this big space is available for their work. </p> <p>He can also pull in the stars. Next month Joseph Fiennes returns to the stage, not at the trendy Donmar, but at the Sheffield Crucible, where he plays the title role in Grandage's production of Marlowe's Edward II. \"I'd like to think that one day maybe I'll be able to programme Edward II without Joe Fiennes in the lead and still get an audience,\" says Grandage. \"But it takes time to build an audience and they don't give you many chances to fail. And why should they? It costs money to go to the theatre. I've only ever done plays that I've been passionate about, but what I've realised here is that it's no good saying, 'I'm passionate about Lorca,' then playing to only 10% capacity.\" </p> <p>Grandage admits that he has had good timing. His predecessor at Sheffield, Deborah Paige, not only gave him some of his first breaks as a director but laid the foundations for the theatre's renaissance with ground-breaking work. Grandage's arrival in Sheffield coincided with the Boyden report into the state of British theatre, the promise of new money for regional theatre and a psychological shift that sees theatrical energy moving away from London and beyond the M25. </p> <p>Not so long ago, regional theatre was seen as the equivalent of being put out to grass, but all that is changing. Grandage now has his own proteges, including Paul Miller, who directed Accomplices, and David Hunt, whose production of Arthur Miller's play The Man Who Had All the Luck is now at the Crucible. \"The time has come to be bold in the regions,\" says Grandage. \"We've got to seize the opportunity and the money that are coming our way and put them to good use. For too long people have tried to second-guess what audiences want, and nobody has ever done it successfully. The only way you'll get an audience and keep it is by delivering a constant level of high-quality work. I could put on a John Godber play and get an audience, but I'd prefer to take the risk and put on Accomplices and build an audience from that. </p> <p>\"I always keep in mind what happened at the Citizens in Glasgow when the theatre was on the brink of financial disaster. The team were discussing how they could stay open and somebody said, 'Look, we've given the audience what we think they want and they don't want it. Why not do a season of work in which we give the audience what we want to direct?' It worked and they never looked back. I believe in doing what you want. If I'm not passionate about a play, why should anyone else be?\" </p> <p>&amp;#149: The Man Who Had All the Luck is at the Sheffield Crucible until February 24. Box office: 0114-249 6000.</p>",

Grandage now has his own proteges, including Paul Miller, who directed Accomplices, and David Hunt, whose production of Arthur Miller's play The Man Who Had All the Luck is now at the Crucible. \"The time has come to be bold in the regions,\" says Grandage. \"We've got to seize the opportunity and the money that are coming our way and put them to good use. For too long people have tried to second-guess what audiences want, and nobody has ever done it successfully. The only way you'll get an audience and keep it is by delivering a constant level of high-quality work. I could put on a John Godber play and get an audience, but I'd prefer to take the risk and put on Accomplices and build an audience from that. \"I always keep in mind what happened at the Citizens in Glasgow when the theatre was on the brink of financial disaster. The team were discussing how they could stay open and somebody said, 'Look, we've given the audience what we think they want and they don't want it. Why not do a season of work in which we give the audience what we want to direct?' It worked and they never looked back. I believe in doing what you want. If I'm not passionate about a play, why should anyone else be?\" \u2022: The Man Who Had All the Luck is at the Sheffield Crucible until February 24. Box office: 0114-249 6000.",

      "body": "<p>Last week we, at the Today programme, were in Brussels for a programme of specious, relentlessly biased, pro-European Union drivel, if you are to believe Christopher Booker in one of the weekend's newspapers.</p> <p>Enraging Mr Booker is gratifying, of course, but that wasn't the only objective. The intention was to tackle some of the questions raised by a hefty section of our listeners which, on the issue of the EU, feels disenfranchised by Parliament and badly served by broadcasters.</p> <p>So, the first question we asked was: should Britain withdraw from the EU and what would happen to us if we did? It's a question we're not encouraged to ask; the vast majority of our politicians, when you ask them, tell you not to be so stupid and quickly change the subject. And yet the only substantial study into the consequences of withdrawal suggests the economic effects would be, at worst, ambivalent.</p> <p>Given the fervour of our dissenting listeners, the logical second question was: can the BBC be trusted to cover the EU debate fairly? My guess is that there's a substantial proportion of the population - more than the third who believe we should withdraw, less than the two thirds or so who oppose joining a single currency - whose opposition to greater integration is visceral and based on principle, rather than solely pragmatic. Perhaps we sometimes underplayed these arguments in the past, not least because such views are rarely articulated in Parliament. The defence of the BBC - and a commitment to more such programmes - was provided by my boss, Mark Damazer. (Well, one of my bosses. I have more bosses than you could shake a stick at. Or shake a kukri at, that curved Nepalese sword used in the ceremonial dismembering of goats.)</p> <p>On the mainland, of course, there's bewilderment at our insularity. But the train journey to Brussels provides one clue to the different attitudes here and abroad. As France dissolves into Belgium with no change in language, geography, architecture, and climate, you see why the notion of an inviolable nation state is a less relevant concept over there.

      "bodyText": "Last week we, at the Today programme, were in Brussels for a programme of specious, relentlessly biased, pro-European Union drivel, if you are to believe Christopher Booker in one of the weekend's newspapers. Enraging Mr Booker is gratifying, of course, but that wasn't the only objective. The intention was to tackle some of the questions raised by a hefty section of our listeners which, on the issue of the EU, feels disenfranchised by Parliament and badly served by broadcasters. So, the first question we asked was: should Britain withdraw from the EU and what would happen to us if we did? It's a question we're not encouraged to ask; the vast majority of our politicians, when you ask them, tell you not to be so stupid and quickly change the subject. And yet the only substantial study into the consequences of withdrawal suggests the economic effects would be, at worst, ambivalent. Given the fervour of our dissenting listeners, the logical second question was: can the BBC be trusted to cover the EU debate fairly? My guess is that there's a substantial proportion of the population - more than the third who believe we should withdraw, less than the two thirds or so who oppose joining a single currency - whose opposition to greater integration is visceral and based on principle, rather than solely pragmatic. Perhaps we sometimes underplayed these arguments in the past, not least because such views are rarely articulated in Parliament. The defence of the BBC - and a commitment to more such programmes - was provided by my boss, Mark Damazer. (Well, one of my bosses. I have more bosses than you could shake a stick at. Or shake a kukri at, that curved Nepalese sword used in the ceremonial dismembering of goats.) On the mainland, of course, there's bewilderment at our insularity. But the train journey to Brussels provides one clue to the different attitudes here and abroad. As France dissolves into Belgium with no change in language, geography, architecture, and climate, you see why the notion of an inviolable nation state is a less relevant concept over there. The boundaries have shifted too many times. And, you could argue, the Europeans most convinced by the idea of a sovereign nation state are those - like the Flemish Belgians, the Basques, the Catalans - who have never really had one. Meanwhile, a new language is forming in Brussels; visible in virtually every advertisement, heard in every caf\u00e9, bar and restaurant. It's a sort of ad hoc Esperanto, the difficult stuff in English but with a smattering of French, German and Italian. One advert used four languages in the space of eight words and was intelligible to all. Very democratic, although I doubt the French and Christopher Booker will agree. \u0095 Rod Liddle is editor of BBC Radio 4's Today programme. His column appears every Wednesday",

Ariel Sharon, who once seemed destined only for exile into disgrace, is now the prime minister of Israel. For anyone who wishes peace for that nation and its neighbours, today is among the darkest of days.</p> <p>Sharon's been around so long - a fighter in the pre-state, Jewish resistance against the British in the 40s, a key player in every one of Israel's five wars - that there is barely a need to recite the roll call of shame that constitutes his CV. Israelis know of the brutal reprisal raids he led against Palestinian infiltrators in the 50s, just as they recall his blood-soaked invasion of Lebanon three decades later. They know an internal Israeli inquiry held him \"indirectly responsible\" for massacres at Sabra and Chatila of more than 2,000 Palestinian refugees, slaughtered by Israeli-backed Lebanese Christian militiamen. They know, too, that that same inquiry declared Sharon unfit to serve as defence minister (let alone the job he holds this morning). And they know that he has opposed every move Israel has ever made toward peace - from the 70s Camp David accords with Egypt, right through to the Oslo agreement with the Palestinians of the 90s.</p> <p>They have seen the company he keeps. Men like Avigdor Lieberman, whose game plan for the Middle East includes setting Beirut on fire, launching missiles at Tehran, destroying the Aswan dam and recapturing villages already handed back to the Palestinians. They know that Lieberman is likely to be part of Sharon's coalition, a government which threatens to be the most rightwing in Israel's history.</p> <p>They know the likely consequences of a Sharon administration. Ostracism beckons, as the world community turns a cold shoulder toward a nation led by a thug whose own law courts (in a libel case against the Ha'aretz newspaper) have branded him a liar. Foreign investment, which depends on stability, will evaporate further; Israel's economy will struggle. The country's link with the Jewish diaspora will weaken, too: Jews in the United States, Britain and elsewhere may want less and less to do with an Israel that could choose Sharon as its leader.</p> <p>Above all, they know the most immediate result of their actions yesterday. For the election of a leader who does not be lieve in peace takes Israel one step closer to the alternative: war. Israelis understand that. Asked which candidate was more likely to plunge Israel into an all-out confrontation with its neighbours, a wide majority plumped for Sharon.</p> <p>And yet, despite all that, there he stands this morning: Ariel, King of Israel. Why have Israelis done it? Why have they taken a step towards what seems, from the outside, national suicide?</p> <p>There are the conventional, political explanations of course. A new generation of voters (those under 35) and a million new immigrants, chiefly from the old Soviet Union, have no memory of Sharon's past antics: to them the invasion of Lebanon lives only in the history books.</p> <p>And of course there was Sharon's biggest asset: his opponent. Ehud Barak may have been a masterful soldier, but he was an appalling politician. He came across as arrogant and unfeeling, wholly unskilled in the necessary emolliences of vote-getting. Meanwhile, Sharon was pulling off one of the great political con-tricks of modern times - running TV ads depicting him as a cuddly old man, walking Israel's streets holding the hand of a small child.</p> <p>Still it was not the image-makers who decided this election. Barak's fate was sealed by forces far more fundamental - starting with fear. Israelis deserted the Labour leader because they no longer believed he could protect them, neither from the random bombs that rip apart a bus or street market in an instant, nor from the Palestinian snipers' bullets that have been raining down on Jerusalem's outermost suburbs for nearly four months. Israelis have complained of a constant, gnawing sense of anxiety - and Barak forgot that his task, as prime minister, was to make them feel safe.</p> <p>That, after all, is why he was elected in the first place. Like his mentor and predecessor, the slain Yitzhak Rabin, Barak was meant to be \"Mr Security\" - a former chief of staff who would keep Israelis' enemies at bay. In his determination to forge a peace deal with the Palestinians, Barak forgot that task: on his watch, Palestinian stone-throwing escalated into a conflict just short of a shooting war. It was a critical lapse of judgment, ignoring the lesson of Rabin at Oslo, and even Menachem Begin at Camp David: that in order to be a dove, by making peace, an Israeli leader must first be a hawk, by providing security.</p> <p>It was this failure, rather than the concessions Barak was prepared to offer, that cost him so dear. It's true that most Israelis found the outgoing PM's willingness to hand back 95% of the West Bank and to divide Jerusalem hard to stomach - but precedent suggests they would have swallowed it eventually, on two conditions. First, if the Palestinians had accepted Israel's offer and signed a genuine peace deal and, second, if everyday life had become more tranquil. Neither of those conditions were met, and so voters moved to punish Barak.</p> <p>Add to Israelis' fear, their confusion. The left especially still cannot quite figure out why Barak's approach - offering compromises no predecessor had ever dared - so enraged Palestinians that they rebelled more spiritedly against him than they ever did against the iron fist of Begin, Shamir or Netanyahu.</p> <p>The Israeli left had always argued that compromise would bring peace - only for the events of the past few months to prove them spectacularly wrong. Offer compromise and what you get is an uprising, one bloodier than any protest that came when you offered nothing. Suddenly the right seemed right: the Israeli floating voter looked at Sharon's decades-old contention - that the Arabs regard every concession as a sign of weakness and reward it with violence - and reckoned he'd been right all along.</p> <p>The result is a rejection of the entire Oslo-Rabin-Barak approach. \"We've tried the good cop,\" Israelis said yesterday, \"and that didn't work.

All were members of, or shareholders in, a series of illicit drinking dens in Riyadh - Celtic Corner, Woodlands, Raffles and the Empire Club.</p> <p>Mr Mitchell, a former soldier, worked as chief anaesthetics technician at the Security Forces Hospital in Riyadh but also had a stake in three drinking dens for expatriates and supplied satellite dishes - officially banned in the kingdom - as a sideline.</p> <p>He later sold his stake in one of the drinking dens to Christopher Rodway, the 47-year-old Briton who died in an explosion on November 17.</p> <p>Letters regarding the transaction were written by Mr Mitchell on a hospital computer which has been seized by the Saudi authorities, the sources said.</p> <p>Oddly, Mr Mitchell also developed a serious interest in religion, friends said yesterday. He read many books on Islam and, on the night of his arrest last December, had been due to attend a party at the hospital where he and several colleagues were to announce their conversion to the faith.</p> <p>In the televised confessions, Mr Mitchell and his co-accused said they had been ordered to carry out the bomb attacks.</p> <p>Yesterday the Saudi-owned newspaper, Asharq al-Awsat, quoted the interior minister, Prince Nayef, as saying that \"foreign countries were behind the orders\" and had \"provided them with high-tech explosive materials\". He said the countries were \"linked to the nationalities of those arrested\".</p> <p>A military plastic explosive called C4 was used in the attacks, he said.</p> <p>C4 was developed for the US military during the Vietnam war. It has been sold by the US to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran (under the shah), and several Nato countries possess it. The US also used it in the 1991 Gulf war.</p> <p>The formula for C4 is not secret and quantities have occasionally been stolen. About 20 years ago a former CIA agent was convicted of shipping 21 tons of C4 to Libya, allegedly for terrorist training.</p> <p>More recently it was used by terrorists in the bomb attack on the USS Cole in Yemen last October which killed 17 people and injured 39.</p> <p>Shortly after the killing of Mr Rodway the Saudi authorities began hinting that the attack was not terrorist-related. Their investigation centred on his acquaintances and in particular on any grudges they may have held against him.</p> <p>The Saudi authorities have now agreed to let British con sular staff visit Mr Mitchell, the Foreign Office said yesterday. The agreement came during an hour-long meeting between the British ambassador and the Saudi interior minister.</p> <p>\"The ambassador requested repeated consular access to Mr Mitchell and the interior minister undertook to grant that request,\" a spokesman said.</p> <p>Under Saudi law, Mr Mitchell will only be allowed to see a lawyer once the investigation into his case has been completed.</p> <p>Lawyer Stephen Jakobi, of Fair Trials Abroad, said the confessions were \"show trials\" and added: \"I would say this is the worst case affecting a European citizen I have seen anywhere in the world.\"</p> <p>Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said the Foreign Office should be firm in its demands that the Britons were properly treated.</p> <p>But he added: \"If there's been a breach of the law in Saudi Arabia then the Saudi Arabian authorities are entitled to prosecute.\"</p> <p>Mr Rodway's father, Jerry, 69, a retired sales representative from Salisbury, Wiltshire, said that if Mr Mitchell was found guilty of killing his son he should be executed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Alexander Mitchell, the Briton facing execution in Saudi Arabia after he admitted planting a car bomb, had a business relationship with the man he is accused of killing, sources in Riyadh's expatriate community said yesterday. Mr Mitchell, 44, was shown on Saudi television confessing - along with a Belgian and a Canadian - to having bombed two cars in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, last November, killing one Briton and injuring five other people. A total of nine people - none of them Saudis - are being held by the authorities in connection with the investigation. All were members of, or shareholders in, a series of illicit drinking dens in Riyadh - Celtic Corner, Woodlands, Raffles and the Empire Club. Mr Mitchell, a former soldier, worked as chief anaesthetics technician at the Security Forces Hospital in Riyadh but also had a stake in three drinking dens for expatriates and supplied satellite dishes - officially banned in the kingdom - as a sideline. He later sold his stake in one of the drinking dens to Christopher Rodway, the 47-year-old Briton who died in an explosion on November 17. Letters regarding the transaction were written by Mr Mitchell on a hospital computer which has been seized by the Saudi authorities, the sources said. Oddly, Mr Mitchell also developed a serious interest in religion, friends said yesterday. He read many books on Islam and, on the night of his arrest last December, had been due to attend a party at the hospital where he and several colleagues were to announce their conversion to the faith. In the televised confessions, Mr Mitchell and his co-accused said they had been ordered to carry out the bomb attacks. Yesterday the Saudi-owned newspaper, Asharq al-Awsat, quoted the interior minister, Prince Nayef, as saying that \"foreign countries were behind the orders\" and had \"provided them with high-tech explosive materials\". He said the countries were \"linked to the nationalities of those arrested\". A military plastic explosive called C4 was used in the attacks, he said. C4 was developed for the US military during the Vietnam war. It has been sold by the US to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Iran (under the shah), and several Nato countries possess it. The US also used it in the 1991 Gulf war. The formula for C4 is not secret and quantities have occasionally been stolen. About 20 years ago a former CIA agent was convicted of shipping 21 tons of C4 to Libya, allegedly for terrorist training. More recently it was used by terrorists in the bomb attack on the USS Cole in Yemen last October which killed 17 people and injured 39. Shortly after the killing of Mr Rodway the Saudi authorities began hinting that the attack was not terrorist-related. Their investigation centred on his acquaintances and in particular on any grudges they may have held against him. The Saudi authorities have now agreed to let British con sular staff visit Mr Mitchell, the Foreign Office said yesterday. The agreement came during an hour-long meeting between the British ambassador and the Saudi interior minister. \"The ambassador requested repeated consular access to Mr Mitchell and the interior minister undertook to grant that request,\" a spokesman said. Under Saudi law, Mr Mitchell will only be allowed to see a lawyer once the investigation into his case has been completed. Lawyer Stephen Jakobi, of Fair Trials Abroad, said the confessions were \"show trials\" and added: \"I would say this is the worst case affecting a European citizen I have seen anywhere in the world.\" Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, said the Foreign Office should be firm in its demands that the Britons were properly treated. But he added: \"If there's been a breach of the law in Saudi Arabia then the Saudi Arabian authorities are entitled to prosecute.\" Mr Rodway's father, Jerry, 69, a retired sales representative from Salisbury, Wiltshire, said that if Mr Mitchell was found guilty of killing his son he should be executed.",

In the West Bank and Gaza, frustration with Israel's 33-year occupation was boiling over.</p> <p>Mr Sharon - nicknamed the Bulldozer - ploughed on. He climbed up to the disputed holy site in a phalanx of Israeli riot police. When the police staggered back down 45 minutes later, ducking chairs and rubbish bins hurled by Palestinian protesters, the intifada had begun.</p> <p>Four months and 380 deaths later, Israelis yesterday were set to entrust the old warhorse with guiding them out of the bloody mess he unleashed.</p> <p>In so doing, they are saying they no longer believe in peace with the Palestinians. If war is inevitable, they feel safer with a man who spent 50 years crushing Israel's enemies than with Ehud Barak, the prime minister who promised peace, but delivered a terrifying Palestinian uprising.</p> <p>In soft-focus campaign ads, which cast Mr Sharon, 72, as a kindly grandfather cuddling baby goats on his 1,000-acre farm, the rotund general insisted he wanted peace as badly as Mr Barak, who pursued negotiations to the last days of his prime ministership.</p> <p><b> Rosy rhetoric</b><br></p> <p>\"There have been attempts to divide Israel into those who want peace, and those who are opposed to peace. I want to say: we all want peace,\" he told his final campaign rally in the coastal city of Holon.</p> <p>\"In the army, I made life and death decisions, not just for me but for many men, and so I say I understand peace much better than many politicians.\"</p> <p>But Mr Sharon has never explained his vision of peace, or how he can manage to reach a deal when Mr Barak, who was willing to offer much more to the Palestinians, failed so spectacularly.</p> <p>The execution of Mr Sharon's vague peace policies are also hostage to the kind of coalition he can muster in Israel's fractured parliament, or Knesset. By Israeli law, Mr Sharon must form a government by the end of March - 45 days after the publication of official poll results - or else the country faces new elections.</p> <p>Mr Sharon says he wants a national unity government with Mr Barak's Labour party. Israeli politicians who know Mr Sharon well, including the Nobel prize laureate, Shimon Peres, believe such a coalition could temper Israel's warrior.</p> <p>But if Mr Sharon forsakes a unity government for a narrow coalition with extreme rightwing parties, he could ditch his rosy campaign rhetoric and revert to earlier form. Mr Sharon's putative coalition partners from the far-right claim the bulky general would not hesitate to bomb Beirut and Cairo in case of attack.</p> <p>Such drastic action is in keeping with Mr Sharon's temperament. \"A single motif recurs throughout Sharon's military and political life: \"Always escalate\" writes Avishai Margalit, a philosophy professor at the Hebrew University in an essay on Mr Sharon. \"He believes that in the muddle resulting from an increase in violence he will always come out the winner.</p> <p>He will know how to create a situation in which people turn to him because he is self-confident and he knows what he wants.\"</p> <p>Mr Sharon is Israel's original commando, the founder of the army's Unit 101, infamous for blowing up 69 people, half of them women and children, in a 1953 raid on the West Bank village of Qibya.</p> <p>In the 1970s, he relentlessly expanded Jewish settlements. As defence minister in 1982, he marched Israel's army all the way to Beirut, after assuring the cabinet that troops would only advance to within 40kms of the Lebanese border. He then allowed Christian militias to enter the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, in Beirut's southern suburbs, where they slaughtered 800 Palestinians. The atrocity forced Mr Sharon to resign, and a government commission said he was unfit to be defence minister.</p> <p>But voters demonstrated yesterday that they are willing to overlook Mr Sharon's bloody past at a time when the Palestinian uprising is killing their fellow Israelis on an almost daily basis.</p> <p>\"I voted for Ariel Sharon, and that is a vote for going to war,\" said artist Ariel-Regev Harari, a Barak voter who changed sides when he cast his vote in Jerusalem's genteel German Colony neighbourhood yesterday. \"But we are forced into going to war because of the situation. Here in Israel we are like sitting ducks.\"</p> <p>Mr Sharon believes a final peace agreement with the Palestinians is impossible now. His recipe is simple: no negotiations with the Palestinians until the uprising ends. \"I will not hold negotiations under fire and terrorism and violence. That was Barak's mistake,\" he told the Ma'ariv newspaper.</p> <p><b> 'Painful concessions'</b><br></p> <p>Mr Sharon also wants the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to arrest all the \"terrorists\" who have led attacks on Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza. He wants a ban on \"incitement\" on the official Palestinian television and radio, and a total overhaul of Palestinian education, with textbooks preaching co-existence with Israel.</p> <p>Then, when Mr Sharon is eventually willing to talk peace, Mr Arafat will be stuck with the 42% of the West Bank he currently controls. Every Jewish trailer perched on lonely hilltops in the West Bank, or moored in sand dunes in the Gaza Strip, will stay put. There will be no concessions on Arab East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since the 1967 war.</p> <p>\"When I talk about painful concessions, I mean we will not reoccupy Nablus and Jericho and other places,\" he told an ultra-orthodox weekly newspaper.</p> <p>He also refuses to accept responsibility for the 3.7m registered Palestinian refugees who lost their homes when the Jewish state was created in 1948.</p> <p>In the unlikely event that the Palestinians are willing to accept those conditions then Mr Sharon is prepared to think about a Palestinian state.</p> <p>\"Over the years, we have to see how it develops,\" he said. \"Gradually, step by step, we might reach a peace agreement.\"</p> <p>However, Mr Sharon does not have years - or even months. Palestinian officials have described Mr Sharon's policies as \"a declaration of war\", and in the West Bank and Gaza, the leaders of Mr Arafat's tanzim militia have called for an escalation of the uprising. \"The best way to deal with Sharon, the only way to deal with Sharon is the intifada and resistance,\" said Marwan Barghouti, a senior Fatah leader in the West Bank.</p> <p>With the Palestinians determined to test Mr Sharon from day one, Israel's old warrior will soon reveal his methods for ending an uprising that Mr Barak failed to contain with tanks, helicopter gunships and the assassination of Fatah commanders.</p> <p>Members of Mr Sharon's coterie say he is unlikely to indulge in the bombardments of Palestinian cities with which Mr Barak tried - and failed - to end the intifada. But he will tighten the ring of steel around Palestinian cities, and intensify restrictions on Palestinian travel in the West Bank.</p> <p>The key to fighting the intifada, Mr Sharon said during the campaign, is to put the Palestinian militias on the defensive \"from a situation in which they are engaged in planning how to take the lives of Jews and Israelis to the point where they will be forced to be totally preoccupied with how to save themselves.\"</p> <p>On the ground, he can be expected to give army commanders a free hand against Palestinian gunmen, and to authorise assassinations of leading Palestinian figures - including members of Mr Arafat's administration - by Israeli hit squads. \"Sharon prefers non-conventional methods in which the unknown element will take the Palestinians by surprise,\" one of his confidants told Ma'ariv yesterday.</p> <p>Israelis are confident Mr Sharon can fight this uprising. But is he the man to end one? The best that he can offer is that he is a man who will not be pushed around. \"I know the Arabs, and the Arabs know me,\" Mr Sharon said repeatedly on the campaign trail. \"They know my word is my word, my yes is my yes and my no is my no. They know I mean what I say and I say what I think.\"</p> <p>The next steps</p> <p><b> February 13</b> Knesset reconvenes. Mr Barak stays on as caretaker prime minister, while Mr Sharon tries to form a coalition from a fractured Knesset</p> <p><b> February 14</b> Publication of official election results. Mr Sharon has 45 days from this day to form a government</p> <p><b> February 28 </b> Deadline for the appeal of the outcome</p> <p><b> March 31 </b> Mr Sharon faces twin deadlines: he must present his government, with at least eight cabinet ministers, or the country faces new elections for prime minister and Knesset.

He will know how to create a situation in which people turn to him because he is self-confident and he knows what he wants.\" Mr Sharon is Israel's original commando, the founder of the army's Unit 101, infamous for blowing up 69 people, half of them women and children, in a 1953 raid on the West Bank village of Qibya. In the 1970s, he relentlessly expanded Jewish settlements. As defence minister in 1982, he marched Israel's army all the way to Beirut, after assuring the cabinet that troops would only advance to within 40kms of the Lebanese border. He then allowed Christian militias to enter the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, in Beirut's southern suburbs, where they slaughtered 800 Palestinians. The atrocity forced Mr Sharon to resign, and a government commission said he was unfit to be defence minister. But voters demonstrated yesterday that they are willing to overlook Mr Sharon's bloody past at a time when the Palestinian uprising is killing their fellow Israelis on an almost daily basis. \"I voted for Ariel Sharon, and that is a vote for going to war,\" said artist Ariel-Regev Harari, a Barak voter who changed sides when he cast his vote in Jerusalem's genteel German Colony neighbourhood yesterday. \"But we are forced into going to war because of the situation. Here in Israel we are like sitting ducks.\" Mr Sharon believes a final peace agreement with the Palestinians is impossible now. His recipe is simple: no negotiations with the Palestinians until the uprising ends. \"I will not hold negotiations under fire and terrorism and violence. That was Barak's mistake,\" he told the Ma'ariv newspaper. 'Painful concessions' Mr Sharon also wants the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to arrest all the \"terrorists\" who have led attacks on Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza. He wants a ban on \"incitement\" on the official Palestinian television and radio, and a total overhaul of Palestinian education, with textbooks preaching co-existence with Israel. Then, when Mr Sharon is eventually willing to talk peace, Mr Arafat will be stuck with the 42% of the West Bank he currently controls. Every Jewish trailer perched on lonely hilltops in the West Bank, or moored in sand dunes in the Gaza Strip, will stay put. There will be no concessions on Arab East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since the 1967 war. \"When I talk about painful concessions, I mean we will not reoccupy Nablus and Jericho and other places,\" he told an ultra-orthodox weekly newspaper. He also refuses to accept responsibility for the 3.7m registered Palestinian refugees who lost their homes when the Jewish state was created in 1948. In the unlikely event that the Palestinians are willing to accept those conditions then Mr Sharon is prepared to think about a Palestinian state. \"Over the years, we have to see how it develops,\" he said. \"Gradually, step by step, we might reach a peace agreement.\" However, Mr Sharon does not have years - or even months. Palestinian officials have described Mr Sharon's policies as \"a declaration of war\", and in the West Bank and Gaza, the leaders of Mr Arafat's tanzim militia have called for an escalation of the uprising. \"The best way to deal with Sharon, the only way to deal with Sharon is the intifada and resistance,\" said Marwan Barghouti, a senior Fatah leader in the West Bank. With the Palestinians determined to test Mr Sharon from day one, Israel's old warrior will soon reveal his methods for ending an uprising that Mr Barak failed to contain with tanks, helicopter gunships and the assassination of Fatah commanders. Members of Mr Sharon's coterie say he is unlikely to indulge in the bombardments of Palestinian cities with which Mr Barak tried - and failed - to end the intifada. But he will tighten the ring of steel around Palestinian cities, and intensify restrictions on Palestinian travel in the West Bank. The key to fighting the intifada, Mr Sharon said during the campaign, is to put the Palestinian militias on the defensive \"from a situation in which they are engaged in planning how to take the lives of Jews and Israelis to the point where they will be forced to be totally preoccupied with how to save themselves.\" On the ground, he can be expected to give army commanders a free hand against Palestinian gunmen, and to authorise assassinations of leading Palestinian figures - including members of Mr Arafat's administration - by Israeli hit squads. \"Sharon prefers non-conventional methods in which the unknown element will take the Palestinians by surprise,\" one of his confidants told Ma'ariv yesterday. Israelis are confident Mr Sharon can fight this uprising. But is he the man to end one? The best that he can offer is that he is a man who will not be pushed around. \"I know the Arabs, and the Arabs know me,\" Mr Sharon said repeatedly on the campaign trail. \"They know my word is my word, my yes is my yes and my no is my no. They know I mean what I say and I say what I think.\" The next steps February 13 Knesset reconvenes. Mr Barak stays on as caretaker prime minister, while Mr Sharon tries to form a coalition from a fractured Knesset February 14 Publication of official election results. Mr Sharon has 45 days from this day to form a government February 28 Deadline for the appeal of the outcome March 31 Mr Sharon faces twin deadlines: he must present his government, with at least eight cabinet ministers, or the country faces new elections for prime minister and Knesset. New elections must be held in 60 days. This is also the last day for him to pass the budget; if he does not, the country faces a new general election in 60 days",

Zut! Alors! - the fugitive businessman Alfred Sirven is arrested in the Philippines, and immediately claims that he could provide evidence of corruption against \"100 names\" - that is, most of the political \u00e9lite of the Mitterrand era.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Peru, the seizure of more than 2,000 secretly obtained videotapes reveals the extent of the power of the fallen President Fujimori's secret state over just about everyone in that country's ruling class. Journalists, politicians, generals were all being blackmailed for years.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in India, the Bofors scandal bubbles to the surface again. The rumours of corruption surrounding this 1980s arms deal have already besmirched the reputations of the late Rajiv Gandhi - did he or did he not accept illegal kickbacks? - and the late Olof Palme - was he assassinated by a disgruntled middleman? Now, as the Indian courts turn their attention to the activities of the billionaire Hinduja brothers, the old scandal threatens to hurl new dirt across the oceans, at the British government, which became so improbably friendly with the Hindujas.</p> <p>(A four-year-old child could have warned the Blairites against this association. Unfortunately, no four-year-old child was available, and as a result the British public presently believes New Labour to be almost as sleazy as the grubby Tories they replaced. Almost as sleazy as Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken!

      "bodyText": "One day after France's former foreign minister, the almost impossibly grand Roland Dumas, who is on trial for corruption, denounces the proceedings against him - that a personage as distinguished as he should be subjected to such an ordeal! Zut! Alors! - the fugitive businessman Alfred Sirven is arrested in the Philippines, and immediately claims that he could provide evidence of corruption against \"100 names\" - that is, most of the political \u00e9lite of the Mitterrand era. Meanwhile, in Peru, the seizure of more than 2,000 secretly obtained videotapes reveals the extent of the power of the fallen President Fujimori's secret state over just about everyone in that country's ruling class. Journalists, politicians, generals were all being blackmailed for years. Meanwhile, in India, the Bofors scandal bubbles to the surface again. The rumours of corruption surrounding this 1980s arms deal have already besmirched the reputations of the late Rajiv Gandhi - did he or did he not accept illegal kickbacks? - and the late Olof Palme - was he assassinated by a disgruntled middleman? Now, as the Indian courts turn their attention to the activities of the billionaire Hinduja brothers, the old scandal threatens to hurl new dirt across the oceans, at the British government, which became so improbably friendly with the Hindujas. (A four-year-old child could have warned the Blairites against this association. Unfortunately, no four-year-old child was available, and as a result the British public presently believes New Labour to be almost as sleazy as the grubby Tories they replaced. Almost as sleazy as Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken! Well . . . gosh.) Meanwhile, in the United States, ex-President Clinton is under fire for having pardoned the fugitive financier Marc Rich, while his successor, \"President\" Bush, mouths platitudes about bilateralism while pursuing an agenda of the extreme right; and this in spite of the growing evidence that he lost the election he \"won\" thanks to the notorious supreme court coup; and lost it, in Florida, by a margin of around 25,000 votes. Yes, sleaze has resurfaced, grinning its slobbering grin, to remind us that it never really went away - that it remains the great occult force that bends and shapes the age, its existence perennially denied, its empire expanding daily. You can almost admire its inexhaustible inventiveness. Things you never imagined were sleazy - things that actually were never tarnished before - come daily under sleaze's slimy suzerainty, and are hopelessly compromised, or, like innocence or paradise, lost.

      "bodyText": "Leading doctors admitted for the first time yesterday that health rationing is inevitable and that the guiding principle of the NHS as a comprehensive service \"may have outlived its usefulness\". Ian Bogle, chairman of the British Medical Association, asked for a public debate in the run-up to the general election about which treatments should no longer be freely available so that resources could be preserved for essential public services. He embarrassed the government by casting doubt on the sufficiency of promises in the NHS plan last year to increase the health budget by a third in real terms by 2004. The extra resources were a welcome respite from problems of underfunding, but the money could never be sufficient to meet expanding demand and the government's treatment of this long-term problem was simplistic, he said. \"We have to accept the prospect of treatments being excluded from the NHS if we want to maintain a universal service, one which is available to everyone and essentially free at the point of use,\" he said. The BMA's intervention came after a year-long review of healthcare funding by representatives of doctors, nurses, patients, pharmaceutical companies and private health providers. Their report said it would become increasingly commonplace for treatments to be excluded from the NHS if they were not deemed cost-effective or an appropriate use of public funds. The private sector might fill part of this gap by treating people who were prepared to pay. \"However, the private sector cannot be a universal panacea for the perceived failings of the NHS. Unless the government and public are prepared to face up to the inevitability of rationing, the debate addressed in this review will recur perpetually and ... the most vulnerable will continue to suffer,\" the report said. Dr Bogle refused to give examples of treatments that were likely to become unavailable on the NHS. But the report mentioned fertility treatment, tattoo removal, cosmetic surgery and gender reassignment as low-budget services that were not provided in every NHS area. Other possible exclusions might include counselling and drugs for baldness, obesity and impotence. It was understood the BMA was pressing the government to take the debate forward by extending the remit of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence to look at the appropriateness of NHS funding for a range of existing treatments. The review team rejected a series of possible NHS reforms that might have filled the funding gap. Charging for treatment was not appropriate because those most in need of healthcare were generally least able to pay for it. Tax relief for private health insurance would subsidise those who could already afford it. Lottery funding was likely to remain minimal. The report came as the Department of Health announced that waiting lists for inpatient treatment at NHS hospitals in England increased by 13,200 in December. Ministers said the rise was less than usual at that time of year and drew satisfaction from a fall in the waiting list for outpatient treatment. Those waiting more than 13 weeks for an outpatient's ap pointment fell from 435,768 to 399,137 in the three months to December. The department welcomed the BMA's conclusion that the UK's health needs were best served by a tax-funded system. \"We are giving the NHS its biggest funding boost for a generation, a real terms increase of one third in its budget between 1999 and 2004. \"We would not be doing that if we thought there was an alternative which was acceptable to the public and which actually worked in practice,\" a spokesman said.

      "bodyText": "The Austrian authorities demanded yesterday that two British newspapers retract their claim that the deputy leader of the government in Vienna is a \"Nazi\" and a \"fascist\". The Daily Star and the Sun used the terms in their reports of an encounter between the Austrian vice-chancellor, Susanne Riess-Passer, and Prince Edward and his wife Sophie Rhys-Jones. The three were filmed together at a reception in the ski resort of St Anton at the end of January. Ms Riess-Passer took over from J\u00f6rg Haider as leader of the far-right Freedom party in May. The party's inclusion in the coalition government earlier that year cost Austria seven months of isolation from the rest of the EU. Even though the EU lifted its sanctions against Vienna in September, the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, pointedly avoided meeting Freedom party representatives when he visited the city a month later. Asked if the Royal couple had been briefed by British diplomats on the sensitive political situation in Austria, an official said: \"No official briefing was sought, because they had no formal or informal meetings.\" In a letter to the editor of the Daily Star, the Austrian ambassador to London, Alexander Christiani, described his paper's coverage as a \"devastating defamation\" of the deputy chancellor. He added: \"Choose your words more carefully.\" Mr Christiani said: \"You are outrageously comparing the current Austrian government and one of its members to the inhumane, criminal and genocidal regime of Hitler Germany.\" He demanded a correction, which the Daily Star last night refused to give. Its editor, Peter Hill, said: \"We are sorry that the Austrian government are upset, but our evidence shows that Susanne Riess-Passer leads a party that has unacceptable right-wing views\". A spokeswoman for the Austrian embassy said an EU inquiry had concluded that the Freedom party could fairly be described as \"right-populist with extremist tendencies\", but not as Nazi or fascist. Ms Riess-Passer was one of about 1,000 guests at the reception given after the royal couple inaugurated the 2001 world alpine ski championships. A photograph apparently taken from television coverage of the event was published on Monday in the Austrian news magazine Profil. Prince Edward's spokesman said yesterday: \"It was one photograph among many that were taken and there was no meeting in the programme with [the Freedom] party or any other party. The picture was reproduced in the Daily Star under the headline \"Outrage as Edward hobnobs with Nazi.\" The Sun headlined its story: \"Edward and fascist.\" Alongside was another photograph of another Edward, his great-uncle, meeting Hitler in 1937, 10 months after his abdication. Prince Edward's spokesman said: \"Like other members of the royal family, [the prince and his wife] meet thousands of people in the course of their official engagements. They couldn't reasonably be expected to know who everyone was.\" It is the second time the royal family has been caught in a row over the Austrian far right. In February 1997, before Freedom won a share of power, the Duchess of York was photographed being kissed on the hand by Mr Haider. A spokesman for Austria's then governing Social Democrat party said: \"She should have been much more careful. She was very naive.\" The photograph of the royal couple appeared as part of a report on the Freedom party's publicity techniques. In an editorial, Profil wrote: \"The Freedom party is desperate to become socially acceptable and is delighted by an opportunity like this\"",

Elizabeth Filkin has agreed to look into William Hague's acceptance of the \u00a35m from the IG Index chairman, Stuart Wheeler, after receiving a formal complaint by Labour MP Alan Simpson. Mr Simpson, whose gambling is limited to \u00a31 on the Grand National, met the parliamentary commissioner for standards yesterday to accuse Mr Hague of bringing the House of Commons into disrepute. The Nottingham South MP said the Tory leader had improved his prospects by taking money from a spread betting magnate who hoped to make money on the number of seats the Conservatives win. \"Mr Wheeler stands to make a considerable amount of money out of the election in which the bookie has ended up in bed with the horse,\" said Mr Simpson. \"What we are talking about is the biggest single donation in British political history, and it happens to have been placed by someone who is also running a book on the result.\" Mr Simpson, who also asked the Financial Services Authority to investigate, said there were clear parallels with the case of Motherwell and Wishaw MP Frank Roy, who was censured before Christmas after betting \u00a320 - and winning \u00a33,400 - on the election of the Commons Speaker.

It is Fotherington-Thomas, who famously skipped around proclaiming \"Hallo sky, hallo birds\". Some of us had long suspected the presence of a Fotherington-Thomas tendency biding its time among the roses. GM Greenwood Brighton The Labour party has received my subscription and I have had a letter and glossy literature from my leader, Tony, welcoming me to the party. I also received a welcoming letter from my MP, Robert Sheldon; both have offered me their help as a new boy. This would have been very ego-massaging except for the fact that I have been a Labour voter and member for 50 years and have done my share of letterbox stuffing. I have replied to my \"new\" colleagues offering my services in the next election and requesting a snap of Tony in which he is not grinning. Mike Mitchell Manchester mickiam@lineone.net John Killah (Frome) and Leslie Dalton (Eastbourne) are understandibly ripping up their Labour party membership cards, disappointed with its right-ward drift (Letters, February 6). I note from their addresses, that both men live in Lib Dem/Tory marginal constituencies, as I do (Westmorland &amp; Lonsdale). This is indeed good fortune, because they can now vote for a radical party with principles (the Lib Dems in case you were wondering) and ensure the defeat of a Tory at the same time.

Rather than face a challenge by the Russians in the US courts, the US transport department has given Aeroflot a waiver on the White House ban. The ban, issued in June, prohibits smoking on all international airlines operating to and from the US. Aeroflot's current policy is to allow smoking on international flights lasting longer than three hours. The waiver ends a six-month tussle between the Americans and the Russians. Moscow warned that they would take court action against the White House, complained to international air regulators, and threatened to make US airlines flying to Russia carry Russian-speaking staff. Aeroflot, which proclaimed smoking a sovereign and fundamental right under a UN charter, believes the decision provides it with a tobacco-friendly market niche. Boris Yeliseyev, its senior lawyer, denounced the White House ban as interference in the affairs of other nations and a breach of article two of the UN charter on the sovereignty of UN member states. The Americans, Aeroflot complained, were seeking to extend the writ of their laws to foreign legal subjects beyond US territory. Aeroflot threatened to go to court in the US and also took its complaint to the International Air Transport Association, which gave its backing in October. Aeroflot also warned that it would lobby to have Moscow oblige foreign airlines plying Russian routes to have Russian-speaking staff on board. \"It was legal ping-pong,\" Mr Yeliseyev told the business newspaper Vedomosti.",

      "bodyText": "In one the army's biggest ever actions against drugs, 18 soldiers from the 1st Battalion the King's Regiment face dismissal from the service after testing positive for cocaine and cannabis, it emerged yesterday. The men, based at Weeton, Lancashire, were found to have traces of the drugs in their urine after the army tested 300 servicemen in the barracks in December. The latest embarrassment to the army, following the dismissal of 15 members of the Light Dragoons for ecstasy and cannabis use last month, highlights the rise in the number of soldiers caught taking drugs. Since random testing was introduced by the army in 1995, more than 2,300 soldiers have been dismissed from the service. The latest figures available, for the first 10 months of last year, show drug taking to be on the rise, with 580 soldiers failing tests, compared with 485 for the whole of 1999. The soldiers at Weeton who tested positive are mainly kingsmen - the regiment's equivalent to a private - plus a small number of lance-corporals. Last year a total of 12 soldiers were thrown out of the battalion, which has served in Northern Ireland and boasts the Queen Mother as its colonel in chief, for drug taking. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: \"There were 18 members of the battalion found to have provided positive samples in an army drugs test. Drug misuse is unacceptable and the normal course of action is that anyone found taking drugs will be removed from the army.\" Although the army is seriously undermanned, with a shortage of just under 7,000 soldiers, it maintains a zero tolerance policy towards drug taking. \"These people are flying planes, driving tanks and handling live ammunition and we just cannot afford to have them in the army,\" the spokesman said. However, he said that compared with society as a whole the army's record on drugs was good. \"When you consider we have carried out more than 390,000 drug tests - enough to test every soldier in the army four times over - only 0.58% have tested positive. \"In other workplaces the figure is likely to be nearer 7%.\"",

      "body": "<p>No prison director in living memory has been as blunt. In language even harsher than penal reformers use, Martin Narey condemned his own service for \"a litany of failure and moral neglect\" in a remarkably bold address to its annual conference this week. He described some of the 136 prisons under his command as \"hell holes\", where inmates were denied dignity and treated as \"a sub species\". He went on: \"I am not prepared to continue to apologise for failing prison after failing prison. I've had enough of trying to explain the very immorality of our treatment of some prisoners and the degradation of some establishments.\"</p> <p>If there was any doubt within the institutions that their director was committed to change, there could be no doubt by the end. He openly declared that unless he won the support of managers and staff, he would seek \"an easier way of earning a living\". He explained: \"The only reason, the only justification for my doing this job, the only thing that can make it remotely worthwhile, is a passionate belief that the apologies and the abject explanations will no longer be necessary.\"</p> <p>Some progress - even in hell holes - has been made. The director rightly pointed out that lack of cash and excessive overcrowding have been used in the past to excuse the inexcusable. There is no excuse for filthy unclean prisons or refusing to treat inmates with respect. Neither costs much money. As last week's G2 prison series documented, private prisons helped shame the public into introducing more respect for inmates.</p> <p>Yesterday, the director's indictment received the endorsement of Jack Straw, opening a rare opportunity for radical reform. The home secretary was unequivocal: \"I entirely agree with him.\" Mr Straw went on to spell out what was needed to make such closed institutions more accountable: substantial external pressure to raise standards; tough inspection; and a good director general.</p> <p>So the ball is now in the home secretary's court. There is one way he could reassure penal reformers that \"substantial external pressure\" and \"tough inspection\" will continue: the reappointment, as the chief inspector for prisons, of Sir David Ramsbotham.

      "bodyText": "No prison director in living memory has been as blunt. In language even harsher than penal reformers use, Martin Narey condemned his own service for \"a litany of failure and moral neglect\" in a remarkably bold address to its annual conference this week. He described some of the 136 prisons under his command as \"hell holes\", where inmates were denied dignity and treated as \"a sub species\". He went on: \"I am not prepared to continue to apologise for failing prison after failing prison. I've had enough of trying to explain the very immorality of our treatment of some prisoners and the degradation of some establishments.\" If there was any doubt within the institutions that their director was committed to change, there could be no doubt by the end. He openly declared that unless he won the support of managers and staff, he would seek \"an easier way of earning a living\". He explained: \"The only reason, the only justification for my doing this job, the only thing that can make it remotely worthwhile, is a passionate belief that the apologies and the abject explanations will no longer be necessary.\" Some progress - even in hell holes - has been made. The director rightly pointed out that lack of cash and excessive overcrowding have been used in the past to excuse the inexcusable. There is no excuse for filthy unclean prisons or refusing to treat inmates with respect. Neither costs much money. As last week's G2 prison series documented, private prisons helped shame the public into introducing more respect for inmates. Yesterday, the director's indictment received the endorsement of Jack Straw, opening a rare opportunity for radical reform. The home secretary was unequivocal: \"I entirely agree with him.\" Mr Straw went on to spell out what was needed to make such closed institutions more accountable: substantial external pressure to raise standards; tough inspection; and a good director general. So the ball is now in the home secretary's court. There is one way he could reassure penal reformers that \"substantial external pressure\" and \"tough inspection\" will continue: the reappointment, as the chief inspector for prisons, of Sir David Ramsbotham. Mr Straw rightly paid tribute to the \"excellent work\" of Sir David yesterday. He has been unremitting in his pressure for reform and deservedly earned a reputation as an inspiring leader of the team of prison inspectors. He has also established a good working relationship with the director general, so what more effective duo could there be pressing for change? Yet, true to an unworthy Whitehall tradition, Sir David has been denied a second term. Senior mandarins - and seemingly ministers - still regard the robust independence, which the chief inspector has demonstrated, as a threat, rather than a trait that should be encouraged.

He said that during the trial all had \"accepted the frailties of the crown case\" and added: \"The first ground of appeal is and always has been that Thompson has become completely discredited as a witness as he has now conceded and therefore the jury must have been quite inadvertently misled at trial into relying upon his evidence to provide support for that given by Daley.\" Mr Clegg did not give the other grounds for appeal because Lord Justice Kennedy, Mr Justice Maurice Kay and Mrs Justice Heather Hallet decided to cut short proceedings because they concluded that the appeal \"must succeed\" on the first ground alone. Nigel Sweeney QC, for the crown, had submitted a three-point admission on Thompson and his evidence, which said the the crown could not \"argue against the proposition that the jury's decision as regards Daley's evidence may have been influenced by their assessment of Thompson's\". Last night, a lawyer for Shaun Russell and his daugh ter Josie - who have rebuilt their lives in north Wales - said the family felt it \"would be highly inappropriate to make any comment\". The court will reconvene tomorrow morning when Mr Clegg will argue that Stone should be freed and not made to face a retrial. He will claim that because of the enormous media interest in the case, his client will never receive a fair trial. The crown will demand a retrial.",

      "body": "<p>Last June, Sir John Stevens, commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, received a letter from three children in Peckham, south London. In neat, joined-up writing, the 10-year-olds expressed what later proved to be tragically prescient concerns. \"We are scared that families are going to be split by crime,\" they wrote. \"We would like to have more patrolling and protection from you.\" </p> <p>The pupils of Bellenden primary school did not get a reply until after they sent a second letter in December, a month after the local killing of Damilola Taylor, who was also 10. Stevens was, perhaps, unaware that the three were expressing what had emerged as the main collective fear of Bellenden's year five - murder. </p> <p>As part of a project, funded by Lambeth, Southwark and Lewisham health action zone, the 28 children were asked what concerned them about the community in which they lived. Among the predictable anxieties about dog mess, litter, smoking, drugs, burglary and bills, murder had appeared with unexpected and alarming frequency. </p> <p>When asked to rank the most mentioned subjects on a scale of one to five, according to how serious and common they were and how much could be done about them, murder was chosen as the single most pressing issue. </p> <p>It was, however, not the first time that children in the area had come up with such an arresting view. Two months earlier, at a Camberwell after-school project, 20 children aged 9-11 also identified murder as the biggest blight on their community. </p> <p>\"It's shocking to think children of this age are thinking these things,\" says Sara Gibbs, project worker for the action zone. \"It may not be surprising in this area, where you regularly see appeals for witnesses for violent attacks and racial attacks on big yellow boards. But when it happened again, in the same area at the same time, and when you consider that they came up with almost 80 different issues, then I was surprised.\" </p> <p>In further work with Gibbs, the Bellenden children discussed what they knew about violent crime and decided to interview the local mayor, shopkeepers and Southwark council's community safety officer to find out more. </p> <p>A 17-year-old boy, Andr\u00e9 Drummond, had been murdered in a knife attack outside McDonald's in Camberwell. Gibbs says: \"He was young. He was black. That really shocked them. In the school, the kids knew his family. They also mentioned Stephen Lawrence. There have been other murders around here. They're very media savvy - they know what's in the papers and they listen to the news. </p> <p>\"It's not just murder. They were aware of violence. They see a lot of information on police appeal boards about violent stabbings, racial attacks and rapes.\" </p> <p>When a similar consultation project - using the same \"child-to-child\" methodology - was undertaken in Manchester, the youngsters chose dog fouling as their main concern. However, in the US city of Chicago, where sister projects operate, murder is often identified as the most pressing issue. \"It's indicative of the area,\" saysd Gibbs. \"It is to do with this inner-city part of London.\" </p> <p>Further work showed that some of the south London children believed the incidence of murder to be higher than it actually was. They talked to the police and wrote to Stevens, as well as to a local newspaper; they produced cartoons, poems and raps, which they performed to the public; and they designed posters which were displayed in a local supermarket. The Bellenden children also went to a local secondary school to talk to older pupils about violence. </p> <p>By the end of the projects, attitudes had changed. Anxiety about violence had eased and the children felt they could address it more easily. \"Not all the adults they spoke to were helpful,\" Gibbs admits. \"There was an attitude from some that thinking about murder wasn't a child's place, that this was a serious adult subject. But the children felt proud that they chose something serious. \" </p> <p>So when Gibbs decided to talk again to the children, after Damilola's murder, she was concerned that the positive work might have been undone. Instead, she found the children resilient. Yes, they were frightened and worried about going out - but they did not want Peckham's reputation sullied. \"I don't like what people have said about this because people are going to think that London isn't a good place to live,\" said one child. </p> <p>Touchingly, the youngsters described strategies they used to feel safer on the street. One said that if you felt you were being followed, you should look around for someone who \"could be your mother\" and bend down next to her, pretending to tie your shoelace. </p> <p>Before working on the south London projects, Gibbs, a medical anthropologist, was researching the impact of armed conflict on children in Mozambique and Cambodia. </p> <p>\"It was heavy stuff and I really didn't expect that, on coming back to London, children here would chose murder as their biggest concern,\" she says. </p> <p>The child-to-child approach, adopted so far in 70 countries, was developed in 1979 by the Institute of Child Health in London. It was designed to be used in Africa, Asia and Latin America as a means of involving children in disease preven tion. In the west, it is intended to promote self-esteem and utilise children's abilities to communicate health messages to their peers. </p> <p>The technique used in south London should be used throughout Britain, according to the Forum on Children and Violence, which campaigns for a less violent society for children and young people. The forum was founded in 1997 following a report by the Gulbenkian Foundation which was prompted by the 1993 murder of James Bulger. </p> <p>Will McMahon, the forum's national coordinator, says there is an urgent need to collect evidence about children's experience of violence - particularly as the British Crime Survey only asks people over 16 whether they have experienced violence or intimidation. The forum is holding workshops with children to collate their views about violence and record their strategies for reducing it. \"Children are very perceptive about what's going on around them and it's important they participate in solutions to feel safe,\" McMahon says. \"Adults have to listen harder.\" </p> <p><strong>Capital offences</strong></p> <p> Children are much less likely to be murdered than adults, according to Home Office figures. There were 95 homicide victims aged 15 and under in 1998-99, compared to 232 victims aged 30-50. A total of 681 people were indicted for murder during that 12-month period. This was down from a 30-year high of 742 in 1995. The majority of victims are acquainted with their attackers, the most common relationship being spouse or partner. </p> <p>There were 159 homicides in London in 1998-99, according to the Metropolitan police.Southwark, of which Peckham and Camberwell are part, had the most murders of any borough, with 14 homicides during that time. Southwark had the second highest rate of violent crime in the capital, with 7,479 offences in the 1999 calendar year.</p>",

      "byline": "Alison Benjamin",

      "body": "<p>Is it possible to quantify the benefits of good building design? A new official report makes a first stab at doing just that, assessing the economic, social and environmental value of recent development schemes in three big cities. </p> <p>The report, released yesterday, is part of a government drive to improve the quality of urban design. It heaps praise on what it concludes is good and spares few feelings in damning what it sees as bad. </p> <p>Office block developments accessible only by car, making no attempt to fit in with the surrounding environment or adding anything to the local community, are singled out as examples of poor design. Standard Court, in Nottingham, is branded \"a disconnected place that does not welcome people in and offers them little once they are there\". </p> <p>By contrast, developments that are inviting, make an effort to blend with surroundings and offer a range of uses score highly on the report's system. Barbirolli Square, in Manchester, is described as \"a gently animated public space with its own distinct character and sense of place and with a good quality of enclosure\". </p> <p>The report, The Value of Urban Design, was drawn up by researchers on behalf of the commission for architecture and the built environment (Cabe), the new government agency set up to boost building design, and the Department of the Environment. The study was launched at a conference, in London, held to build on Cabe's Better Public Buildings report, launched last October by Tony Blair. </p> <p>The conference highlighted the role of central and local government in delivering good urban design beyond the regulatory planning process. Andrew Smith, chief secretary to the Treasury, told delegates that quality design did not necessarily cost more to deliver, but offered strong competitive advantages. </p> <p>The new report suggests that good rental returns and enhanced capital values go hand-in-hand with well-designed schemes. It calls on investors and developers to take on board the commercial evidence and on tenants to recognise the increased prestige that high quality, integrated architecture commands with clients - not to say the favourable impact it has on staff loyalty and health. Public authorities also benefit, it says, when run-down areas and amenities are returned to public use and urban centres are revitalised. </p> <p>Researchers, from the Bartlett school of planning at University College London, compared pairs of predominantly commercial developments built at roughly the same time and chosen for their similarity in all respects except urban design. These were: Standard Court and Castle Wharf in Nottingham; Barbirolli Square and Exchange Quay in Greater Manchester; Brindleyplace in Birmingham and the Waterfront business park in nearby Dudley. Each development was gauged against a range of quantitative and qualitative measures such as rental returns, energy consumption, traffic generation and assessed vibrancy. </p> <p>Exchange Quay, a Dallas-style development on the banks of the Manchester Ship Canal in Salford, is described as \"a bland, faceless development with bland, faceless buildings and spaces\" which makes little attempt to connect itself to its hinterland. \"Very heavy security guard presence confirms this is predominately a private, rather than public, place,\" says the report. </p> <p>Whereas Exchange Quay turns it back on its waterfront, Nottingham's Castle Wharf and Birmingham's Brindleyplace both scored highly for openly embracing their canal settings, locating pubs and restaurants to maximum effect. </p> <p>However, according to Esterre Property Management, which manages Exchange Quay, the very features on which it is marked down are its selling points. Darren Tyson, estates supervisor, says: \"There is only one fence. It is 7ft [2.1m] high, but there aren't any spikes. There is an estate right next door. I'm not saying everyone on it is rough, but you only have to speak to the police to know we have a need for security and our tenants [mainly insurance companies] demand it. They are paying for security, maintenance and landscaping.\" </p> <p> The Manchester branch of Masons law firm moved out of Exchange Quay just over three years ago - to Barbirolli Square. Comprising two office blocks on one side of the square, with the Bridgewater concert hall on the other, the development is praised by the report. \"The clever use of levels allows the central space to step down to a re-established canal basin on to which a new cafe opens up,\" it says. </p> <p>Edward Davies, a partner at Masons, cites expansion as the reason for the move to Barbirolli and says most clients would have preferred the firm to stay put. \"Exchange Quay was conveniently located just off the motorway, had surface parking and good security, and the Copthorne hotel was across the road for lunch. They thought it was wonderful.\" </p> <p>While Exchange Quay offers investors returns of just 1% to 3%, Barbirolli commands the highest rents in Manchester and the office project is now valued at \u00a360m, compared to its \u00a327.5m cost. Such financial facts back up Cabe's argument that better design adds economic value. \"Good urban design definitely pays back,\" says Jon Rouse, Cabe's chief executive. </p> <p>Many have yet to be convinced. John Gilder, property director of the Mill Group, which developed part of Nottingham's Standard Court, insists he is content with his scheme's performance, despite the report's critical appraisal. Particularly scathing comment is passed by the researchers on the development's hardly used public arena. Gilder admits that the only people making use of the arena are skateboarders - and they are doing so illegally - and he concedes that Standard Court lacks the warmth, closeness and pleasant environment that make nearby Castle Wharf a \"destination location\". </p> <p>Such shortcomings are said to illustrate the crucial role that local authority planning departments have to play in urban design and delivery of economic, social and environmental benefits. Departments can and should be proactive, says the report, and should positively set the design agenda through clear development plan policies, making funding conditional on good design and using the leverage offered by ownership of brownfield sites. </p> <p>Significantly, two of the report's three lower-scoring developments had minimal local authority input, having come under the remit of either development corporations or enterprise zones. Cabe intends to work to ensure that the private/public urban regeneration companies proposed in the urban white paper learn from such mistakes. </p> <p>The Value of Design is available at \u00a325 from Thomas Telford on 020-7665 2464.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Is it possible to quantify the benefits of good building design? A new official report makes a first stab at doing just that, assessing the economic, social and environmental value of recent development schemes in three big cities. The report, released yesterday, is part of a government drive to improve the quality of urban design. It heaps praise on what it concludes is good and spares few feelings in damning what it sees as bad. Office block developments accessible only by car, making no attempt to fit in with the surrounding environment or adding anything to the local community, are singled out as examples of poor design. Standard Court, in Nottingham, is branded \"a disconnected place that does not welcome people in and offers them little once they are there\". By contrast, developments that are inviting, make an effort to blend with surroundings and offer a range of uses score highly on the report's system. Barbirolli Square, in Manchester, is described as \"a gently animated public space with its own distinct character and sense of place and with a good quality of enclosure\". The report, The Value of Urban Design, was drawn up by researchers on behalf of the commission for architecture and the built environment (Cabe), the new government agency set up to boost building design, and the Department of the Environment. The study was launched at a conference, in London, held to build on Cabe's Better Public Buildings report, launched last October by Tony Blair. The conference highlighted the role of central and local government in delivering good urban design beyond the regulatory planning process. Andrew Smith, chief secretary to the Treasury, told delegates that quality design did not necessarily cost more to deliver, but offered strong competitive advantages. The new report suggests that good rental returns and enhanced capital values go hand-in-hand with well-designed schemes. It calls on investors and developers to take on board the commercial evidence and on tenants to recognise the increased prestige that high quality, integrated architecture commands with clients - not to say the favourable impact it has on staff loyalty and health. Public authorities also benefit, it says, when run-down areas and amenities are returned to public use and urban centres are revitalised. Researchers, from the Bartlett school of planning at University College London, compared pairs of predominantly commercial developments built at roughly the same time and chosen for their similarity in all respects except urban design. These were: Standard Court and Castle Wharf in Nottingham; Barbirolli Square and Exchange Quay in Greater Manchester; Brindleyplace in Birmingham and the Waterfront business park in nearby Dudley. Each development was gauged against a range of quantitative and qualitative measures such as rental returns, energy consumption, traffic generation and assessed vibrancy. Exchange Quay, a Dallas-style development on the banks of the Manchester Ship Canal in Salford, is described as \"a bland, faceless development with bland, faceless buildings and spaces\" which makes little attempt to connect itself to its hinterland. \"Very heavy security guard presence confirms this is predominately a private, rather than public, place,\" says the report. Whereas Exchange Quay turns it back on its waterfront, Nottingham's Castle Wharf and Birmingham's Brindleyplace both scored highly for openly embracing their canal settings, locating pubs and restaurants to maximum effect. However, according to Esterre Property Management, which manages Exchange Quay, the very features on which it is marked down are its selling points. Darren Tyson, estates supervisor, says: \"There is only one fence. It is 7ft [2.1m] high, but there aren't any spikes. There is an estate right next door. I'm not saying everyone on it is rough, but you only have to speak to the police to know we have a need for security and our tenants [mainly insurance companies] demand it. They are paying for security, maintenance and landscaping.\" The Manchester branch of Masons law firm moved out of Exchange Quay just over three years ago - to Barbirolli Square. Comprising two office blocks on one side of the square, with the Bridgewater concert hall on the other, the development is praised by the report. \"The clever use of levels allows the central space to step down to a re-established canal basin on to which a new cafe opens up,\" it says. Edward Davies, a partner at Masons, cites expansion as the reason for the move to Barbirolli and says most clients would have preferred the firm to stay put. \"Exchange Quay was conveniently located just off the motorway, had surface parking and good security, and the Copthorne hotel was across the road for lunch. They thought it was wonderful.\" While Exchange Quay offers investors returns of just 1% to 3%, Barbirolli commands the highest rents in Manchester and the office project is now valued at \u00a360m, compared to its \u00a327.5m cost. Such financial facts back up Cabe's argument that better design adds economic value. \"Good urban design definitely pays back,\" says Jon Rouse, Cabe's chief executive. Many have yet to be convinced. John Gilder, property director of the Mill Group, which developed part of Nottingham's Standard Court, insists he is content with his scheme's performance, despite the report's critical appraisal. Particularly scathing comment is passed by the researchers on the development's hardly used public arena. Gilder admits that the only people making use of the arena are skateboarders - and they are doing so illegally - and he concedes that Standard Court lacks the warmth, closeness and pleasant environment that make nearby Castle Wharf a \"destination location\". Such shortcomings are said to illustrate the crucial role that local authority planning departments have to play in urban design and delivery of economic, social and environmental benefits. Departments can and should be proactive, says the report, and should positively set the design agenda through clear development plan policies, making funding conditional on good design and using the leverage offered by ownership of brownfield sites. Significantly, two of the report's three lower-scoring developments had minimal local authority input, having come under the remit of either development corporations or enterprise zones. Cabe intends to work to ensure that the private/public urban regeneration companies proposed in the urban white paper learn from such mistakes. The Value of Design is available at \u00a325 from Thomas Telford on 020-7665 2464.",

There will always be a tension between national standards and local flexibility, Crisp acknowledges. But he says: \"If we were having this conversation in a year's time, people would be saying they have more discretion and I would be saying national standards are better established and we are more prepared to let go.\"",

      "body": "<p> Like most couples, Kevin Mason and Joanne Proctor value their privacy. They live in the same house, so you might think that finding intimate time together would be relatively easy. For two fully grown adults, it should be. </p> <p>But the house which Mason and Proctor (not their real names) live in is a group home for people with learning disabilities; and when Mason asks if he can have private time with his girlfriend in his bedroom, the staff refuse. Not surprisingly, 32-year-old Mason is far from happy. \"We just want to be together, but we're not allowed. We have to kiss outside.\" </p> <p>It may not seem like a violation of human rights to most people, but according to Andrew Lee, director of People First, a self-advocacy group for people with learning disabilities, that's exactly what it is. </p> <p>\"It's about power and control,\" says Lee. \"People with learning disabilities are often in very vulnerable positions and their rights are easily abused.\" Often such \"abuse\" is not malicious: it just arises out of broad assumptions among social services, carers, even parents, about the ability of people like Mason and Proctor to make decisions for themselves. </p> <p>John Harris, director of the British Institute of Learning Disabilities (Bild), believes such rights violations are \"endemic\". He says: \"Anywhere you care to point your finger there's a rights issue - in education, employment, housing, transport, relationships and, especially, healthcare.\" </p> <p>Lee cites a national survey by charity Mencap which found that 98% of people with learning disabilities were discriminated against on a daily basis by one or more people. He says he's heard a string of stories similar to Mason's and Proctor's. </p> <p>Take the couple who have been partners for 20 years, but are told by support staff that they cannot stay together for longer than a weekend at a time. Then there's the People First member, a man in his 50s, who was told he could not go to a fundraising meeting because he had to make his bed. And there is the man left waiting outside the care home where he lives because he isn't allowed a key. </p> <p>Harris believes the Human Rights Act, which came into force in October last year, could give people with learning disabilities a basis to act against such treatment. Tomorrow, at a conference in London, Bild is launching an \"easy guide\" to the legislation, written for people with learning disabilities, as well as carers, support workers and service deliverers. </p> <p>\"The key motive is to raise awareness of the act among people with learning disabilities,\" says the guide's co-author, Phil Coombs. \"That means explaining the act in a simple and accessible way. So much information you see is poorly presented.\" </p> <p>Coombs is manager of a community business called Working with Words, set up in 1997 by learning disability groups in Greenwich, south London, to produce information in a form and language appropriate to them. Although it is part-funded by Greenwich social services, the project takes orders from outside organisations and charges for its work. The business also turns out accessible versions of local authority documents and college handbooks, using graphics and websites designed by those who have learning disabilities. </p> <p>Working with Words devised and produced the human rights guide, and an accompanying poster, in response to a request from people with learning disabilities who had met to talk about the act and, not surprisingly, found it difficult to understand. </p> <p>\"The Human Rights Act is an important piece of legislation,\" says Coombs. \"It's very applicable to people with learning disabilities, but it won't help them unless they know what it means.\" </p> <p>The poster uses simple ideas of \"rights\" and \"wrongs\" to spell out the freedoms protected by the act, while the guide includes personal experiences of abuse as described by people with learning disabilities. Coombs thinks such experiences will be recognised by other groups, such as elderly people and those with mental health problems. </p> <p>Harris has no doubt that it is a much-needed document. \"The Human Rights Act is important in that it flags up a whole range of issues,\" he says. \"This gives us an opportunity to illustrate how people with learning disabilities are simply not treated as citizens with similar rights to other people.\" </p> <p>\"We've been a society that's based on dealing with learning disabilities by excluding people. Now we're starting to see that has to change. Human rights are a great basis to do it.\" </p> <p>Harris points out that, for decades, people with learning disabilities have been judged and controlled as a group, whereas human rights thinking demands that the dignity of each individual is respected. For Lee, this is what makes an accessible version of the act so important. \"If people know about it, imagine the impact it could have,\" he says. \"We can use it to take action.\" </p> <p>The guide has been welcomed in the wider human rights field, too. Francesca Klug, director of the Human Rights Act research unit at King's College, London, which is staging tomorrow's conference, says: \"This is exactly the sort of thing that should be happening. The act is only going to create the kind of human rights culture that will change attitudes and practices if people take initiatives themselves in their own groups and settings, and explore what potential it has.\" </p> <p>Exactly what protection the act will give through the courts is less clear, however. Caroline Gooding, special adviser on the act to the disability rights commission (DRC), points out that while articles such as the right to privacy and family life, and the right to marry and have a family, seem directly relevant to people with learning disabilities, the legal scope and power of such a complex piece of legislation will only be worked out over time. </p> <p>\"My fear is that judges won't address human rights in a progressive way as far as people with learning disabilities are concerned,\" Gooding says. \"At the moment, there is no enforcement agency, such as a human rights commission, nor is the DRC able to take Human Rights Act cases. What's more, the article on freedom from discrimination does not explicitly mention disability and, anyway, it is only applicable in relation to how the other rights are protected.\" </p> <p>According to Michael Gunn, professor of law at Nottingham Trent University, the real importance of the act, and Bild's guide to it, is that it will make people think about and talk about human rights. \"The fact that the Human Rights Act is there will encourage debate in itself,\" Gunn says. \"Public authorities have a duty to comply with the act so they will have to think: 'Have we got the balance right between supporting people with learning disabilities and protecting them from abusive control?' It raises the profile of human rights issues.\" </p> <p>And in everyday cases, like Mason's and Proctor's, it could be that which counts most. </p> <p>\u0095 The Easy Guide to the Human Rights Act is available at \u00a38 plus 40p p&amp;p from Plymbridge Distributors on 01752-202301.</p>",

      "body": "<p>For two days in January the Bedford hospital trust \"bodies in the chapel\" scandal gripped the nation after several newspapers published pictures of seven corpses stored in a hospital \"chapel\".</p> <p>There was public shock, ministerial outrage and retribution in the form of a sacked manager. An inquiry was launched and pledges were made that such an outrage should never happen again. </p> <p>But now the media storm has blown over, what really happened? What did the inquiry, which reported last week, discover? And what happened next?</p> <p><strong>How did the scandal emerge?</strong></p> <p>Bedfordshire on Sunday and the Sunday Telegraph (followed by several other newspapers) published photographs on January 14 that showed seven bodies wrapped in sheets lying on the floor of the \"chapel\" of rest. The story was generally presented as evidence of an NHS in crisis, and an affront to human dignity. </p> <p><strong>Why were the bodies in the chapel?</strong></p> <p>The door of a temporary mortuary storage facility was inaccessible due to a defective door. The storage capacity of the main mortuary had become \"increasingly inadequate\" over the past decade, partly because of closure of old facilities and because of under investment in new facilities. Last winter, despite leasing an additional refrigerated body store facility, at one time more than 20 bodies were placed at on the floor of the chapel.</p> <p><strong>Who knew that the chapel was being used in this way?</strong></p> <p>Trust chief executive Ken Williams told the inquiry he was aware that the practice of temporarily placing bodies in the chapel had been taking place \"for at least five years\".

      "bodyText": "For two days in January the Bedford hospital trust \"bodies in the chapel\" scandal gripped the nation after several newspapers published pictures of seven corpses stored in a hospital \"chapel\". There was public shock, ministerial outrage and retribution in the form of a sacked manager. An inquiry was launched and pledges were made that such an outrage should never happen again. But now the media storm has blown over, what really happened? What did the inquiry, which reported last week, discover? And what happened next? How did the scandal emerge? Bedfordshire on Sunday and the Sunday Telegraph (followed by several other newspapers) published photographs on January 14 that showed seven bodies wrapped in sheets lying on the floor of the \"chapel\" of rest. The story was generally presented as evidence of an NHS in crisis, and an affront to human dignity. Why were the bodies in the chapel? The door of a temporary mortuary storage facility was inaccessible due to a defective door. The storage capacity of the main mortuary had become \"increasingly inadequate\" over the past decade, partly because of closure of old facilities and because of under investment in new facilities. Last winter, despite leasing an additional refrigerated body store facility, at one time more than 20 bodies were placed at on the floor of the chapel. Who knew that the chapel was being used in this way? Trust chief executive Ken Williams told the inquiry he was aware that the practice of temporarily placing bodies in the chapel had been taking place \"for at least five years\". Porters and mortuary workers knew, as did local Unison official Willy White, to whom union members had reported the problem. The trust board was unaware of the practice. Isn't treating bodies in this way obviously bad practice? The coroner was not overtly shocked. He told the inquiry that \"use of the chapel area (in this way) was not in itself wrong at times of particular pressure, provided that it was used appropriately and with due regard for the dignity of the diseased\". Similarly, pathology consultants at the trust on the whole \"did not see (this practice) as untoward\". Why didn't the chaplain complain about the use of his chapel? The chapel of rest is not a place of religious worship but an unrefrigerated, carpeted annexe of the main mortuary used to allow relatives to view a deceased relative (but not when bodies were stored there). It is a secure area, and not normally accessible to the public. Why didn't Unison contact the trust board about the bodies in the chapel, rather than contacting the local newspaper? Mr White said there was \"a culture in the hospital which had prevented people feeling able to raise their concerns internally\". The inquiry report says that, while this may have been true for \"blue collar\" staff, the majority of professional staff felt the culture of the trust was \"friendly and open\". The trust had a whistleblowing policy in place but it had never been used. Was this just Unison settling old scores? Managers and medical staff told the inquiry the incident could be traced to a bitter management-Unison feud over the dismissal of a staff member last year, and that the taking of the photographs was \"a deliberate act\" in a campaign to discredit the chief executive \"by any means\". Mr White said he was simply raising a serious issue of malpractice at the trust. If the mortuary is \"secure\", how did a photographer gain access? There were two sets of mortuary keys, one in the porter's lodge and one in the casualty department. No trust employee interviewed would admit to allowing the journalists access to the mortuary. The inquiry concludes that it \"was unable to establish who had breached security and more importantly patient confidentiality by using their access to these keys\". If bodies are wrapped in sheets before being placed in the chapel, how was one of the bodies identified from pictures in the newspapers? Part of the face and legs of one of the bodies was exposed on one of the bodies, which could have been an accident or could have been posed. The inquiry says that most staff \"refused to believe that the photographs could have been obtained except by tampering with the bodies and their coverings beforehand\".

Chief among concerns are the costs of becoming a beacon and the fact that beacon status currently offers little in terms of extra funding or extra spending freedoms. </p> <p>The scheme was devised as a means to spread good practice by identifying the best councils and then inviting other authorities to learn from them. Almost all councils in England and Wales have attended a beacon event and ministers believe the approach is proving a success. </p> <p>But the number of applications fell last year. In the initial flurry of enthusiasm for the scheme's first round, the government received almost 270 bids. In the second round, that fell to 173. The government believes that an element of self-selection has entered the process as councils realise how tough are the standards. </p> <p>But Tory local government spokesman Nigel Waterson offers a different explanation. The beacon scheme is \"expensive and time consuming,\" he says. \"Local residents know better than ministers whether their local council is performing well and delivering the services they need.\" </p> <p>Money is certainly an issue for councils. The beacon application process eats up precious time and funds, as do the roadshows and open days that successful authorities have to organise to share their good practice. Although the government does provide financial support for successful beacons, local government minister Hilary Armstrong has admitted that the scheme does leave some councils out of pocket. As Mitchell says: \"The reward is tiny. It's something like \u00a320,000 at the end of the day.\" </p> <p>To combat the perceived lack of reward in becoming a beacon, ministers have promised a \"beacons phase two\", in which successful councils could win new freedoms and flexibilities - including the power to raise extra local business rates, or toincrease council tax levels without fear of capping. The government has yet to set a timetable for this, despite pressure from county councils. Their umbrella group, the County Councils Network, has met local government minister Beverley Hughes to push her on the issue - but has failed to get an answer. </p> <p>Armstrong argues that councils which apply for the scheme are already reaping rewards. \"The key thing is that, if authorities learn from what's going on elsewhere, they'll learn ways of saving money through greater efficiency,\" she says. \"Those that are beacons in one service area should be learning from other areas.\" </p> <p>Changes seem inevitable in the beacon scheme, largely because the original proposals for phase two are already becoming obsolete. Plans for reforming local government finance include handing councils more control of the business rate, and local public service agreements (PSAs) promise authorities a wide range of new freedoms and flexibilities. Both of these policy moves will allow all councils to benefit, not just the best. </p> <p>There is nothing to suggest, however, that this will mean scrapping the beacon scheme. Armstrong says: \"We actually believe that there is good practice, but that local authorities don't learn from each other, so they're reinventing the wheel.

Another nail in the coffin of the UK's target of a 20% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions which relied on continued nuclear production.",

And, worryingly, companies are building and selling bigger, more lethal weaponry which can have the same effect as anti-personnel mines. </p> <p>\"At the time the treaty was signed, it was recognised that all landmines which could be set off by a person should be banned\", says Richard Lloyd, of the campaigning charity Landmine Action. \"But since then we have found some companies and countries have made unbanned anti-tank mines which are more lethal for people.\" </p> <p>From BAe Systems/Royal Ordnance comes the Mk 7 anti-tank blast mine that includes an \"anti-disturbance\" double impulse fuse which detonates when rotated on its axis.

The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), containing the AT2, is made by a consortium of European companies, including British company Hunting Engineering. The MLRS propels rockets containing a number of AT2 anti-tank-mines, which have an integral anti-handling device. The Ministry of defence stocks about 100,000 of these lethal weapons. But what of the ban, and didn't the MoD very publicly destroy all its stocks. </p> <p>A spokesman for Hunting acknowledged that anti-tank mines with sensitive fuses could kill personnel, but said: \"We have supplied this equipment to the German company Diehl, who have supplied MLR2 to the German and British armies.

While the treaty bans anti-personnel landmines, the devil is in the definition. </p> <p>\"The major weakness of the definition is that it is set by design, not effect,\" says Rae McGrath, nobel laureate and former director of the Mines Advisory Group. \"A maker could escape liability by arguing that the weapon was designed to be a washing machine but just happened to have the effect of a landmine. If any weapon has the effect of an anti-personnel mine, it should be banned.\" </p> <p>It is this loophole which is allowing companies to build bigger and more lethal anti-personnel weapons than ever before. It has also enabled the MoD to make a public show of destroying redundant anti-personnel landmines while actually stocking up with the new lethal anti-tank variety. </p> <p>\"I don't care about the technology or who makes the AT2 mine,\" says McGrath. \"At the moment, what worries me is that British companies and the MoD are involved in producing and putting into service the MLRS, which will result in a mine which will act as an anti-personnel mine. This is at a time when taxpayers' money is being spent on clearing up landmines in other countries. </p> <p>Another area where the Ottawa treaty has been tested and found wanting is that of enforcement. Some 16 months ago, a Romanian company was exposed offering banned anti-personnel landmines for sale at the government-sponsored arms show. The government set up an inquiry after Romtehnica was discovered offering the banned weapons for sale at the Defence Systems and Equipment international exhibition in Surrey in September 1999. </p> <p>The MoD police took statements from the various people involved in exposing the company and a case file was passed to the crown prosecution service, which says that the file is still open.

Some 138 countries have now signed the Ottawa treaty, with 110 ratifying it. There have been 22m stockpiled anti-personnel landmines destroyed over the past three years by more than 50 nations. Over the past year, seven of the largest demining programmes cleared a combined total of 168m square metres of land. The number of producer nations has also dropped from 54 to 16. </p> <p>But there is still much to do, with more than 250m anti-personnel landmines remaining in the arsenals of 105 nations.

      "body": "<p>Wendy Ewald makes child's play of photography. Since 1969, the American photographer has travelled to often troubled parts of the world - South Africa, India, Saudi Arabia, Morocco - and to communities under pressure, whether from poverty, racial tension or religious stricture. Wherever she lived for an extended period, she collaborated with local children. </p> <p>While she takes documentary photographs from an outsider's perspective, the children take their own snapshots. Ewald then mixes these up and presents them on the same artistic level, challenging the hierarchies between artist and subject, outsider and community, adult and child. This might not now sound the stuff of wild radicalism, but it was three decades ago, when her project on an Indian reservation in Canada revealed the levels of squalor, dysfunction and alcoholism through the children's photographs, not her own. </p> <p>At first glance, Secret Games, Ewald's intense, packed exhibition of images and words (the children's stories sometimes desperately moving, other times trite and foolish) might look like any other in which the adult photographer captures children on film.

      "bodyText": "Wendy Ewald makes child's play of photography. Since 1969, the American photographer has travelled to often troubled parts of the world - South Africa, India, Saudi Arabia, Morocco - and to communities under pressure, whether from poverty, racial tension or religious stricture. Wherever she lived for an extended period, she collaborated with local children. While she takes documentary photographs from an outsider's perspective, the children take their own snapshots. Ewald then mixes these up and presents them on the same artistic level, challenging the hierarchies between artist and subject, outsider and community, adult and child. This might not now sound the stuff of wild radicalism, but it was three decades ago, when her project on an Indian reservation in Canada revealed the levels of squalor, dysfunction and alcoholism through the children's photographs, not her own. At first glance, Secret Games, Ewald's intense, packed exhibition of images and words (the children's stories sometimes desperately moving, other times trite and foolish) might look like any other in which the adult photographer captures children on film. During the private view, a man ranted to me about photographers objectifying children, making them dress up. He blushed when I pointed out that the images he was especially bothered by were children's self-portraits. As well as being novel in form, Ewald's journeys into very different social and political contexts provide a sense of the status of the image across the globe.

Played with passion, as it was in David Leveaux's 1983 revival at the Riverside Studios, it can be devastating. But although conscientiously competent, Matthew Lloyd's new production lacks O'Neill's peculiar cornered desperation. </p> <p>In outline, the play sounds like rustic melodrama. We are down on the farm in backwoods Connecticut in 1923. Phil Hogan, an Irish-American tenant farmer, is terrified that his scratchy bit of land will be sold. To forestall that, he tries to get his hulking daughter, Josie, into bed with his womanising landlord, James Tyrone Jr. </p> <p>But O'Neill remorselessly strips away the layers of pretence. Phil, we learn, is driven not by avarice but by paternal love. Josie, widely seen as a scandalous whore, is really a lovelorn innocent. And Tyrone, under his fake Broadway sophistication, is a guilt-ridden wreck craving posthumous absolution. </p> <p>It is a play of gradual disclosure, one that arouses expectations of blarneying comedy and mortgage melodrama only to subvert them. Lloyd's production starts with the advantage of a fine set by Di Seymour that captures the sense of rural decay: cracked windows suspended from the flies, a dead bird impaled on a pole, ploughshares rusting in the yard. But the first half needs to be played with an ebullient, Boucicault-like staginess if the later revelations are to surprise us. By denying O'Neill's exaggerated theatricality, Lloyd robs the climax of its power. </p> <p>The play is also hell to cast. Josie, nearly six feet tall and weighing 180lb, describes herself as \"an ugly overgrown lump of a woman\". Helen Schlesinger, however, has fine-boned features and a palpable physical attractiveness. She does all that acting can do by burying hatchets in wood stumps and squaring up with her fists to a richly effete neighbour. Her moonlit assignation with Tyrone has a deep maternal tenderness, but it is hard to believe this is her last, despairing emotional chance. Even more crucially, Finbar Lynch, though a suitably dapper dandy, never makes you feel that Tyrone's final confession of whoring while accompanying his mother's train-borne coffin is wrung from the depths of an anguished soul. </p> <p>The best performance comes from Gerard Murphy as Josie's father. He has the right barrel-shaped bulk and implies the deviousness of a man who would use his own daughter as a blackmailing decoy. The truth, of course, is otherwise but Murphy gives us the bold theatrical outline in order to undermine it. He alone seems fully to grasp the point: that it is precisely because the play starts as comic Irish melodrama that its poetic revelation of human desperation is finally overwhelming. </p> <p>\u0095 Until February 24.

Its little rubber circles, which are inserted into a woman's vagina to release hormone replacement therapy, should be approved by the FDA within weeks. If successful, these intra-vaginal rings have a huge number of applications, from providing contraception to preventing the spread of HIV or acting as a \"female Viagra\". They release medicine very slowly into the body, can stay in for three months and are apparently undetectable once inside. Critics doubt whether women will really be keen to have such an item inside them. It is a tough one for the City's (mostly male) analysts to work out. But if women do take to it, Galen could be on to a genuine breakthrough in health care. Galen's two founders are already worth a combined \u00a3500m. If the rubber ring takes off, it won't be long before news of their wealth reaches Seattle. Mr Gates could soon be crashing his software with excitement.",

The MPC's mandate is specific: it is to keep inflation at 2.5%, no higher and no lower.

One of the main factors cited by Gordon Brown when he granted the Bank operational independence was that it would take the politics out of monetary policy. There would, the chancellor said, be no more messing around with interest rates in the run-up to elections. However, turning monetary policy into a purely technocratic affair may prove more difficult in practice than it would appear in theory. The next meeting of the MPC takes place just after the Budget, and cutting rates then would look like an endorsement of Mr Brown's fiscal policy. By the time the April meeting rolls around, the parties will probably be on the hustings and the highly charged political environment will make it even harder for the MPC to contemplate a change in rates. </p> <p>As a result, unless rates are moved tomorrow, they may be stuck at 6% for the next three months. Given that monetary policy only works with a time lag, it might be argued that a short delay would not matter that much. But the US experience has indicated that in a modern economy there can be sudden and dramatic mood swings. Putting in place a confidence-boosting measure now will have its attractions to some MPC members. </p> <p>Although that might give the impression that a rate cut is an odds-on certainty, tomorrow's decision is not quite as clear cut as that. Those who counselled caution at last month's meeting may not have seen much in the economic data in the meantime to persuade them to change their minds. The economy grew by only 0.3% in the fourth quarter, well below its potential, but there were a couple of special factors causing a slowdown in output from the energy sector and from transport in the chaos that followed the Hatfield rail crash. </p> <p>Recent news from manufacturing has been mixed. Yesterday's industrial production figures for December showed manufacturing output up 0.3% for the second successive month, with the slow but unspectacular improvement reflecting the differing fortunes of Britain's various industrial sectors. The metal industries - as reflected in the big job losses announced by Corus - are suffering, but the hi-tech end of manufacturing is still doing well. Recent surveys from the Confederation of British Industry, the British Chambers of Commerce and the Engineering Employers Federation have all been slightly more upbeat, perhaps as a result of the slight fall in the value of the pound. </p> <p>Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte &amp; Touche says that tomorrow's decision will not be clear cut, but that the second reduction in the US last week, prompted by the precipitous collapse in confidence, removes the risk that the MPC will be seen as the Fed's poodle. \"A rate cut now would be an insurance policy against similar falls in confidence over here, which may be more difficult to reverse than forestall.\"</p>",

This man roamed mountains and forests, got rat-arsed in hill inns, tupped wenches, and wrote poems about it. Raucous, irreverent, and dead, dead funny. And lovely in parts too, in his poems of birds and water, in his evocation of the cabin he built in the woods for himself and his favourite missus. Sadness for a world lost, but isn't that what we're made of? Random quote: \"I am a leaper bold.\"<br><strong><br>2. My People Blimey by Caradoc Evans</strong><br>Think of Royston Vasey, and then think of something darker, funnier, more absurd, more unsettling. Not easy I know, but here it is, in the tiny rural Welsh community of this collection of short stories. The transliteration of Welsh directly into English in economical, almost painfully spare language creates a deeply peculiar linguistic world, dreamlike and eerie. This man was willing to be reviled as the price of exposing the corruption and hypocrisy of non-conformism. Black-clad, thickly bearded big men booming in chapels; painful births on storm-torn mountains; old ladies eaten by rats. Mad, worrying, horrifying. Random quote: \"fled from the house of sacrifice\".</p> <p><strong>3. One Moonlit Night by Caradog Pritchard</strong><br>See above. And see the black lake; the tiny houses in the night; the bodies floating bloated in the water. Unremittingly dark, determinedly cheerless. Or at least that's the prevailing memory; go back to it (which I do, again and again) and you'll find a perfect evocation of childhood and a twisted, quirky humour. Brave, bizarre, brilliant. Random quote: \"He was going to be hanged in Caernarfon.\"</p> <p><strong>4. In Parenthesis by David Jones</strong><br>One of the best epic poems of the last century. No, one of the best epic poems ever. A speculum into the collective psyche. How myths of our making go to shape us for such things as the unimaginable carnage of the first world war. How everything we label 'civilisation' is founded on very thin ice, and how horrible are the things that lurk beneath. Phantasmagoric and, at the same time, true. Which is perfect for our age. Random quote: \"Plug and splinter/Shin and fibula.\"</p> <p><strong>5. Collected Poems and Collected Stories by Dylan Thomas</strong><br>He had to be in here, didn't he? Forget what you know of Dylan the pisshead, the letch, the boyo, and focus on Dylan the writer. He's the man for the joy in language, the rapture and terror in the world. He created forms of expression utterly, uniquely his. The mystery and innocence of all that we do. A bottle of Irish, a view of the mountains, and the words of this man = joy. Random quote: \"a turtle in a hearse\".</p> <p><strong>6. Collected Poems by RS Thoma</strong>s<br>Grumpy old clergyman, sour old sod. Extolled the virtues of forcing everyone west of the border to speak Cymraeg yet wrote in Saesneg so loads of people would read him. Would ignore people who asked him directions, or send them the wrong way. Truly, a cantankerous get. But lookit: few words, and the universalisation in them of human yearning. Amazing. Read a good definition of 'apophantism', read this book, and you'll be lost for months, years, ever. Essential. Random quote: You've just had one.</p> <p><strong>7. So Long, Hector Bebb by Ron Berry</strong><br>The book which, at the age of about nine, alerted me to the possibilities of speaking for and within one's own community. A vernacular mimetic truth, strong, lyrical, infinitely sad. A voice, a dialect, a commensurately firm identity and the rage resultant when that is lost or robbed. Talking of which, some immoral bugger half-inched my copy ages ago, and it's been long out of print. No luck in second-hand shops either. Somebody, please, reprint it - or failing that, somebody please send me a copy. I'd be eternally grateful, and a tad happier than I am now. Plus I'd pay. Honest. Random quote: can't remember. I was nine years old, for God's sake.</p> <p><strong>8. The Welsh Extremist by Ned Thomas</strong><br>Non-fiction, and frightening; not because of its promotion of militancy, heck no, but because of its revelations and analysis concerning the insidious and evil hegemonic takeover of whole countries, entire ways of life. On behalf of all oppressed nations, and for the individual creative effort threatened by the barren swamp of enforced uniformity. As vital now as it was in the 70s, and as important as Franz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth. Endorsed by Raymond Williams, and he knew a thing or two. Random quote: \"Cracach.\"</p> <p><strong>9. Red Landscapes: New and Selected Poems by Mike Jenkins</strong><br>A Welsh Lallans. Hopelessness in the sink estates, as brilliantly caught as in John Welch's Estates documentary. As far removed from the fudge box view of Wales as the reality is. The Welsh revival starts here: profound political commitment allied with a bone-deep sympathy for blighted lives. Surprising flashes of surreal humour, too. Random quote: \"a tourist's luxury\".</p> <p><strong>10. Edge Territory by Lloyd Robson</strong><br>Or indeed anything else by him, or even one of his intense, confrontational, energetic, inyerface machine gun-stutter readings. Some of the best dialect writing in these islands, ever. The way he plays with voice and typology is wondrous, life-affirming. Drugs, dialect, sex, violence, fun, anger, happiness; it's all here, in Kairdiff as well as Scotland. Read it. Random quote: \"Dylan is dead or ain't you noticed? Read the living poets.\"</p> <p>Which undermines my list somewhat, apart from the last two items, and Ned Thomas at number seven, but he's not a poet. So, yet again: Hmmmmm...</p>",

This man was willing to be reviled as the price of exposing the corruption and hypocrisy of non-conformism. Black-clad, thickly bearded big men booming in chapels; painful births on storm-torn mountains; old ladies eaten by rats. Mad, worrying, horrifying. Random quote: \"fled from the house of sacrifice\". 3. One Moonlit Night by Caradog Pritchard See above. And see the black lake; the tiny houses in the night; the bodies floating bloated in the water. Unremittingly dark, determinedly cheerless. Or at least that's the prevailing memory; go back to it (which I do, again and again) and you'll find a perfect evocation of childhood and a twisted, quirky humour. Brave, bizarre, brilliant. Random quote: \"He was going to be hanged in Caernarfon.\" 4. In Parenthesis by David Jones One of the best epic poems of the last century. No, one of the best epic poems ever. A speculum into the collective psyche. How myths of our making go to shape us for such things as the unimaginable carnage of the first world war. How everything we label 'civilisation' is founded on very thin ice, and how horrible are the things that lurk beneath. Phantasmagoric and, at the same time, true. Which is perfect for our age. Random quote: \"Plug and splinter/Shin and fibula.\" 5. Collected Poems and Collected Stories by Dylan Thomas He had to be in here, didn't he? Forget what you know of Dylan the pisshead, the letch, the boyo, and focus on Dylan the writer. He's the man for the joy in language, the rapture and terror in the world. He created forms of expression utterly, uniquely his. The mystery and innocence of all that we do. A bottle of Irish, a view of the mountains, and the words of this man = joy. Random quote: \"a turtle in a hearse\". 6. Collected Poems by RS Thomas Grumpy old clergyman, sour old sod. Extolled the virtues of forcing everyone west of the border to speak Cymraeg yet wrote in Saesneg so loads of people would read him. Would ignore people who asked him directions, or send them the wrong way. Truly, a cantankerous get. But lookit: few words, and the universalisation in them of human yearning. Amazing. Read a good definition of 'apophantism', read this book, and you'll be lost for months, years, ever. Essential. Random quote: You've just had one. 7. So Long, Hector Bebb by Ron Berry The book which, at the age of about nine, alerted me to the possibilities of speaking for and within one's own community. A vernacular mimetic truth, strong, lyrical, infinitely sad. A voice, a dialect, a commensurately firm identity and the rage resultant when that is lost or robbed. Talking of which, some immoral bugger half-inched my copy ages ago, and it's been long out of print. No luck in second-hand shops either. Somebody, please, reprint it - or failing that, somebody please send me a copy. I'd be eternally grateful, and a tad happier than I am now. Plus I'd pay. Honest. Random quote: can't remember. I was nine years old, for God's sake. 8. The Welsh Extremist by Ned Thomas Non-fiction, and frightening; not because of its promotion of militancy, heck no, but because of its revelations and analysis concerning the insidious and evil hegemonic takeover of whole countries, entire ways of life. On behalf of all oppressed nations, and for the individual creative effort threatened by the barren swamp of enforced uniformity. As vital now as it was in the 70s, and as important as Franz Fanon's The Wretched of the Earth. Endorsed by Raymond Williams, and he knew a thing or two. Random quote: \"Cracach.\" 9. Red Landscapes: New and Selected Poems by Mike Jenkins A Welsh Lallans. Hopelessness in the sink estates, as brilliantly caught as in John Welch's Estates documentary. As far removed from the fudge box view of Wales as the reality is. The Welsh revival starts here: profound political commitment allied with a bone-deep sympathy for blighted lives. Surprising flashes of surreal humour, too. Random quote: \"a tourist's luxury\". 10. Edge Territory by Lloyd Robson Or indeed anything else by him, or even one of his intense, confrontational, energetic, inyerface machine gun-stutter readings. Some of the best dialect writing in these islands, ever. The way he plays with voice and typology is wondrous, life-affirming. Drugs, dialect, sex, violence, fun, anger, happiness; it's all here, in Kairdiff as well as Scotland. Read it. Random quote: \"Dylan is dead or ain't you noticed? Read the living poets.\" Which undermines my list somewhat, apart from the last two items, and Ned Thomas at number seven, but he's not a poet. So, yet again: Hmmmmm...",
