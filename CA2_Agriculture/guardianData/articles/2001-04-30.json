Desperate to escape his Father, O'Hanlon bounds on stage at City Varieties in a decidedly un-Catholic, outsize tartan suit. It doesn't work. You can almost hear the audience thinking: \"Why is Father Dougal wearing a horrible big suit?\" </p> <p>To his credit, O'Hanlon could have any audience in raptures just with a five-minute stint as the daft priest, but he refuses to compromise. Stand-up is where he started, and stand-up may be where he'll one day finish, since there'll always be a demand for a certain type of self-mocking Irish joke. There are jokes about Irish boy bands, jokes about Irish morbidity, and a very funny one about discovering a lost tribe of Irishmen in the Amazon jungle. O'Hanlon is certainly entitled to his indulgence, but perhaps he reaches a bit too quickly for the safety net of jokes about his homeland. </p> <p>Although O'Hanlon is brilliantly analytical on marriage and casual sex, he tends to coast. He has the classic, mildly agitated conversational delivery of many a great Irish comic, but it's wasted on mundane subjects such as hotels. More promisingly, he tackles genetic modification and the pace of modern life, but unlike watching, for instance, Ed Byrne, you don't feel you've learned anything or had your preconceptions challenged. Ardal has more in his locker - lest we forget, he campaigned for Danny McNamee, wrongly imprisoned for the Hyde Park bombing. But having achieved mainstream success, he seems reluctant to test the boundaries of a mainstream audience. </p> <p>Perhaps this is getting him down. Occasionally he seems thoroughly lost for words - \"I don't know what to say . . . you can probably tell\" - and his act triggers laughter rather than uproar.

      "body": "<p>Another year, another set of awards from the chocolate-box setting of Montreux in Switzerland. While Lenny Henry can bask in the glory of his Golden Rose this morning, lesser delegates at the festival can content themselves with Monkey's own set of gongs. </p> <p>For those unfamiliar with the Rose D'Or festival, it is an annual pilgrimage for lig-starved hacks and PRs to an eighth-floor suite of the Intercontinental, the swish hotel overlooking Lake Geneva, where the flow of beer is only matched by the flow of showbiz flannel.</p> <p>The Michael Barrymore award for self-restraint goes to Times media correspondent <strong>Paul \"mine's a pint\" McCann</strong>. After a lunchtime booze-up with top media contacts (well, all right, the Channel 5 press office) McCann stumbled into ITV's Popstars press briefing a little too refreshed. McCann filled a gap in the questioning with this gem lobbed at the bemused band members: \"Is there a dark side,\" he inquired, mysteriously. It later turned out that McCann had meant to ask about the \"down side\" of fame, which disappoints Monkey, who had been looking forward to that Times photo spread: \"Popstars - the parallel universe.\"</p> <p>Staying with a musical theme, the Geri Halliwell award for self-importance goes to <strong>Myleene</strong> from Popstars, whose enthusiasm for fame knows no rivals. Describing the highlights of her celebrated status, she told of the fans who had camped outside the Hear'Say home in north London. \"It's like a mini-Graceland,\" she said. You see, this is what one No1 record does to your sense of proportion.</p> <p>The Robbie Coltrane award for worst piece of hotel-room misbehaviour goes to the TV team who frightened the fish in Lake Geneva with carefully-aimed beer bottles projected from the balcony eight floors up in the Royal Plaza. Apparently in memory of the year Coltrane threw his television set out of his window, one group of badly-behaved PRs launched a competition to see how far into the lake they could aim their empty receptacles. No-one owned up the next day, but Channel 5 chief spokesman <strong>Paul Leather</strong>issued this statement to staff: \"The hotel management team complained about bottles being thrown into the lake from the 8th floor suite. Not only is it dangerous, but it is illegal. I assured them that it didn't happen but if it did, I was the best.\"</p> <p>The Victor Meldrew award for miserable behaviour goes to <strong>Angus Deayton</strong>. After accepting an invitation by the BBC to travel to a delightful mountainside restaurant for dinner with executives, other telly stars and assorted hacks, Mr Deayton declared his disapproval of the seating arrangements and refused to be placed with The Sun's Emily Smith. He then sat by the wall, flanked by two BBC executives and failed to be witty, warm or engaging to anyone who dared to come anywhere near him.</p> <p>Lifelong achievement award for services to smoothies - stand up <strong>Nigel \"the charmer\" Havers</strong>. Not only did he remember everyone's first name, the newspaper they worked for and their shoe size, but he left the dinner organised by the BBC by indulging several female journalists' fantasies with a lingering smacker. \"We were all wafting in a cloud of hormones,\" said one delirious hackette. Angus Deayton, watch and learn. </p> <p>The Anne Robinson award for talking about your salary goes to the Daily Mail showbusiness editor <strong>Alison Boshoff</strong> who surprised everyone at a press conference when she accepted Johnny Vaughan's challenge to reveal her own salary. \"I am on seventy-two and a half thousand and worth every penny of it,\" she beamed to the baffled star. Vaughan still refused to talk numbers while other hacks gasped in awe. But one did break ranks. \"Alison,\" he gushed admiringly, \"you are worth far more than that.\" Is Alan Yentob planning a dawn raid? Monkey should be told.</p> <p>The Uriah Heep award for sycophancy is awarded collectively to the BBC. As Johnny Vaughan arrived in the eighth floor suite for his press conference he was followed by 12, yes 12, corporation executives. The most star-struck was drama and entertainment supremo <strong>Alan Yentob</strong>, who could barely contain his enthusiasm for the newly signed big-money presenter, patting his shoulder repeatedly. Just remember, this is the man who only a few years ago branded Frank Skinner greedy for demanding, er, lots of money.</p> <p>The Alan Yentob award for forgetfulness goes to ....<strong>Alan Yentob</strong>. When he presented his passport at the airport upon departure for Geneva, he was met with a bemused look. \"I see you've changed sex since the last time you were here,\" the official said. Surprise, surprise Yentob had, of course, taken his wife's passport to the airport. </p> <p>A special Pride of Britain award for LWT's countess of spin <strong>Zoe McIntyre</strong>, who (literally) jumped off the side of a mountain in a para-glider, as part of a PR stunt to promote Claire Sweeney's new ITV show. Surely this was taking the job a little too seriously, especially when like McIntyre you are afraid of heights and afraid of flying.</p> <p>The 'we're just good friends' award goes to Graham Norton who brought Castaway star <strong>Ben Fogle</strong> to the Brit awards earlier this year prompting speculation of a courtship.

      "bodyText": "Another year, another set of awards from the chocolate-box setting of Montreux in Switzerland. While Lenny Henry can bask in the glory of his Golden Rose this morning, lesser delegates at the festival can content themselves with Monkey's own set of gongs. For those unfamiliar with the Rose D'Or festival, it is an annual pilgrimage for lig-starved hacks and PRs to an eighth-floor suite of the Intercontinental, the swish hotel overlooking Lake Geneva, where the flow of beer is only matched by the flow of showbiz flannel. The Michael Barrymore award for self-restraint goes to Times media correspondent Paul \"mine's a pint\" McCann. After a lunchtime booze-up with top media contacts (well, all right, the Channel 5 press office) McCann stumbled into ITV's Popstars press briefing a little too refreshed. McCann filled a gap in the questioning with this gem lobbed at the bemused band members: \"Is there a dark side,\" he inquired, mysteriously. It later turned out that McCann had meant to ask about the \"down side\" of fame, which disappoints Monkey, who had been looking forward to that Times photo spread: \"Popstars - the parallel universe.\" Staying with a musical theme, the Geri Halliwell award for self-importance goes to Myleene from Popstars, whose enthusiasm for fame knows no rivals. Describing the highlights of her celebrated status, she told of the fans who had camped outside the Hear'Say home in north London. \"It's like a mini-Graceland,\" she said. You see, this is what one No1 record does to your sense of proportion. The Robbie Coltrane award for worst piece of hotel-room misbehaviour goes to the TV team who frightened the fish in Lake Geneva with carefully-aimed beer bottles projected from the balcony eight floors up in the Royal Plaza. Apparently in memory of the year Coltrane threw his television set out of his window, one group of badly-behaved PRs launched a competition to see how far into the lake they could aim their empty receptacles. No-one owned up the next day, but Channel 5 chief spokesman Paul Leatherissued this statement to staff: \"The hotel management team complained about bottles being thrown into the lake from the 8th floor suite. Not only is it dangerous, but it is illegal. I assured them that it didn't happen but if it did, I was the best.\" The Victor Meldrew award for miserable behaviour goes to Angus Deayton. After accepting an invitation by the BBC to travel to a delightful mountainside restaurant for dinner with executives, other telly stars and assorted hacks, Mr Deayton declared his disapproval of the seating arrangements and refused to be placed with The Sun's Emily Smith. He then sat by the wall, flanked by two BBC executives and failed to be witty, warm or engaging to anyone who dared to come anywhere near him. Lifelong achievement award for services to smoothies - stand up Nigel \"the charmer\" Havers. Not only did he remember everyone's first name, the newspaper they worked for and their shoe size, but he left the dinner organised by the BBC by indulging several female journalists' fantasies with a lingering smacker. \"We were all wafting in a cloud of hormones,\" said one delirious hackette. Angus Deayton, watch and learn. The Anne Robinson award for talking about your salary goes to the Daily Mail showbusiness editor Alison Boshoff who surprised everyone at a press conference when she accepted Johnny Vaughan's challenge to reveal her own salary. \"I am on seventy-two and a half thousand and worth every penny of it,\" she beamed to the baffled star. Vaughan still refused to talk numbers while other hacks gasped in awe. But one did break ranks. \"Alison,\" he gushed admiringly, \"you are worth far more than that.\" Is Alan Yentob planning a dawn raid? Monkey should be told. The Uriah Heep award for sycophancy is awarded collectively to the BBC. As Johnny Vaughan arrived in the eighth floor suite for his press conference he was followed by 12, yes 12, corporation executives. The most star-struck was drama and entertainment supremo Alan Yentob, who could barely contain his enthusiasm for the newly signed big-money presenter, patting his shoulder repeatedly. Just remember, this is the man who only a few years ago branded Frank Skinner greedy for demanding, er, lots of money. The Alan Yentob award for forgetfulness goes to ....Alan Yentob. When he presented his passport at the airport upon departure for Geneva, he was met with a bemused look. \"I see you've changed sex since the last time you were here,\" the official said. Surprise, surprise Yentob had, of course, taken his wife's passport to the airport. A special Pride of Britain award for LWT's countess of spin Zoe McIntyre, who (literally) jumped off the side of a mountain in a para-glider, as part of a PR stunt to promote Claire Sweeney's new ITV show. Surely this was taking the job a little too seriously, especially when like McIntyre you are afraid of heights and afraid of flying. The 'we're just good friends' award goes to Graham Norton who brought Castaway star Ben Fogle to the Brit awards earlier this year prompting speculation of a courtship. The Channel 4 star explained how they were simply worlds apart. \"When we were spotted I turrned to him and said 'you too are on stage'. And he turned round and said, 'U2, golly, they are just the cat's pyjamas'.\" It must have been that year on Taransay. Either that or a nasty knock on the head, Ben. And the award for brass neck goes to the customs lady at City Airport who apprehended three hackettes - two from the Sun and one from Monkeyland on their return from Montreux. \"Are you aware of the kinds of things you are not allowed bring from one country to another?\" she enquired. \"Yes,\" replied one, naturally thinking of the repeated warnings about foot and mouth, \"Food\".

It's music that brings out the best in him; where his approach to some parts of the repertory can be dour, he finds a sense of adventure in Schumann, and fresh corners of his output to explore. </p> <p>Hardly anyone plays the Allegro in concert nowadays. It is all that was completed of a projected B minor Sonata, and shows the young composer trying to reconcile three different tendencies in his music - freewheeling invention, flashy display and the rigour of a classical sonata form. It's not entirely successful, but Pollini provided all the clarity it needs, unerringly identifying those moments when Schumann's own voice emerges from the whirl of figuration and strenuous thematic working, and turning them into uncomplicated poetry. </p> <p>Kreisleriana balances form and lyrical content well-nigh perfectly, and this reading did not try to tip the scales either way: the bone structure of each of the eight pieces was effortlessly clear, the pacing nearly always faultless. The extrovert numbers had all the necessary athleticism and some magical transitions; the introspective ones were just occasionally pushed too hard, but in the fourth piece they also found themselves in dark territory, and in the sixth in an almost trance-like self-contemplation. Perhaps an element of fantasy was missing, though: Schumann's imagination was not allowed to fly quite as freely as it can. </p> <p>The score of Kreisleriana was dedicated in 1838 to Chopin, who returned the compliment the following year with the second of his Ballades. Pollini played all four of them, with the Op 45 Prelude in C sharp minor as a palate-cleansing hors d'oeuvre. Each contained things to admire. In the First there was the sleight-of-hand to sneak in the second subject and the cumulative power of its dramatic climax; the furious eruption of the second theme in the Second made the contrast with its innocent opening complete. In the Third, the symbiosis of the two main themes was made to seem the most natural thing in the world, while all the constituent parts of the Fourth were welded into a seamless unity, every detail under immaculate technical control. </p> <p>A version of this review appeared in later editions of yesterday's paper.</p>",

Spring is traditionally the peak home-buying season but BBA director general Tim Sweeney said the new figures suggested levels of demand well in excess of the usual seasonal upturn. \"With falling interest rates and lower variable rate mortgages from banks, customers are now being presented with more attractive financing options and this must be driving activity in the mortgage market,\" he added. The strong upswing in the mortgage market is expected to last for several months, particularly as the latest figures do not take into account April's base rate reduction, which will have further improved affordability. Nationwide said the picture was upbeat, reporting that house prices rose in April for the third time in four months.

      "body": "<p><strong> 1 Breakfast</strong> </p> <p>Greg Dyke began his war on costs by banning free croissants at Television Centre, the keystone of a cost-cutting, bureaucracy-shedding programme which he claims will save the BBC \u00a320m a year. \"The purge on consultants and expenses showed we were deadly serious about shifting resources into programmes,\" he says. \"Spurred on by the sight of piles of uneaten croissants at the end of morning meetings, I moved against the second breakfast.\" This seems to have been a moral as much as a practical war on waste. He doesn't seem as upset by the free croissants as he is by the fact that no one was eating them. Perhaps they should have bought nicer ones. </p> <p><strong>2 Travel</strong></p> <p>The height of corporate excess has always been the corporate jet, a dubious necessity. A new light jet costs between \u00a33m and \u00a34m, and then you have to hire hangar space and a bloke to stand around polishing it all day. Greg Hutchings, former chief of the Tompkins group, was forced to resign last year when it was revealed that the company had no less than four corporate jets on standby to take him to his holiday home in Portugal. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Plants and flowers</strong> </p> <p>\"If people want fresh flowers on their desks then they can pay for them,\" says Dyke, a man who we can only hope never retires to set up a south coast B&amp;B. Dyke's allergic reaction notwithstanding, many corporations routinely spend thousands on brightening up the soulless towers in which their employees toil. </p> <p>Perhaps the most famous gratuitous leafy extravagance was last year's decision to decorate the ground floor of the new parliamentary office block, Portcullis House with 12 full-grown fig trees from Florida, at a cost of \u00a330,000 per year. It's true - the trees are rented. It sounds like an awful lot of money to pay for the mere proximity of a dozen trees, especially when you realise that the same result could have been achieved with a packet of seeds, some dirt and a little patience. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Heat and light</strong> </p> <p>How much does it cost to leave the lights on all night in your gigantic multistorey HQ? What about leaving them on in selected offices so that from a distance they form the shape of a Christmas tree, or your logo? Is this a good idea? Does it boost morale at companies where employees frequently receive memos telling them that if they want flowers on their desk they can pay for them? </p> <p> <strong> 5 Art</strong></p> <p> The art that hangs in foyers and on boardroom walls has to come from somewhere, and it doesn't come cheap. British Fine Art offers quality 19th-century portraits and landscapes to corporate clients \"in order to motivate staff\" as well as \"conveying the required corporate image\". Figures on a Bridge in the Mountain Valley, by Edmund John Niemann, is on offer for \u00a312,000, so kitting out the boardroom, the corporate dining room and the employee smoking lounge with motivational art could put a serious dent in the company finances. Of course, you can always lease your paintings as if they were trees, making it possible to convey the right corporate image right up until the money runs out. </p> <p> <strong> 6 Magicians </strong> </p> <p>There are no figures on how much the taxpayer shells out every year for conjuring-related expenses, but just last week Scotland Yard announced its decision to hire a magician to teach senior officers leadership skills. There may seem to be a difficult logical leap in such a concept, until you remember that good leadership is all about being able to do the cut-and-restored-rope trick without looking at your hands. This ingenious training course, entitled the Magic of Networking, would save the police \u00a36,000 if it could be made to disappear suddenly. </p> <p> <strong> 7 Paper clips</strong> </p> <p>Millions are spent on paper clips in corporate Britain, yet when you give them up for Lent you hardly notice the difference. According to recent figures from Visa, British businesses spend almost \u00a330bn a year on low-value workplace supplies (such as paper clips, Sellotape and staples). There are tremendous savings to be made across the whole spectrum of office supplies, from staples to computers, and not just by forcing employees to do without. A new business known as e-procurement, whereby corporate purchasing is automated, centralised, rationalised and transacted entirely online looks set to save corporations trillions over the next few years. The national audit office has claimed that the civil service alone could save up to a billion pounds annually if it were to \"fully embrace\" electronic purchasing. </p> <p> <strong> 8 Team-building exercises</strong> </p> <p>A growing phenomenon which uncomfortably straddles the line between training programme and Christmas piss-up, the corporate team-building weekend is generally budgeted as training rather than hospitality, based on the odd belief that two days of running around an assault course is somehow analogous to selling pension funds. </p> <p>Motivation offers such exotic team building exercises as a week spent on patrol with the NYPD and an \"Escape From Colditz\" re-enactment. Clients include Gillette UK, Prudential and SmithKline Beecham, but more often than not one ends up trying to build a raft in a downpour with the help of dysfunctional colleagues from human resources. A sign that team-building weekends might not be all fun and games is the fact that higher-ups rarely feel obliged to attend. \"You don't usually get upper management attending these things,\" says Scott Thomson of CTB-UK, which offers three-day team-building courses in Scotland at a cost of \u00a3450 per head. </p> <p> <strong> 9 Rebranding</strong> </p> <p>As well as spending huge sums sending employees to \"project review\" meetings, which include heli-skiing, companies such as Andersen Consulting fork out millions to change their names to made up words like Accenture, so that everyone can criticise them for it. Obviously it is money well spent, although it is not obvious why. The Post Office has changed its name to Consignia, British Airways changed its tailfins and then changed them back again, and even the penny-pinching Dyke has just called for the BBC to lose its \"Auntie Beeb\" image. It is not clear how he will do it but you can bet it won't be free. </p> <p> <strong> 10 Chairmen/women</strong> </p> <p>They are expensive to procure and even more expensive to get rid of. In addition to a \u00a32.2m signing fee and \u00a310.4m in share options, Marks &amp; Spencer's chairman, Luc Vandevelde, is now to receive a further \u00a3650,000 for his first year's work, just as a thank you for presiding over the company's steady decline. At this point it is probably cheaper to keep him, but when he does go, M &amp; S will almost certainly go right out and get itself another chairman. From where most of us are standing, these multi-million pound rent-a-suit figureheads are more or less interchangeable. Who needs them?</p>",

A pitch invasion, a stand rushed and 27 minutes' worth of stoppages - not to mention the small matter of a run-in with Stoke fans at Crewe on the way home - ensured that the worst elements of the Millwall fan base put their side's achievement in the shade.

The striker is still mulling over an extension to his contract with Kenyon denying he might swap United for Fulham. </p> <p>Boro must wish they could plan that far ahead. Despite Saturday's latest home slump, safety is close - two points from their last two matches would keep Boro up - but Terry Venables must remain on tenterhooks for one more week at least. \"We thought we could have finished the job,\" Paul Ince conceded, \"but other results mean nothing much has changed.\" </p> <p>Plenty has since El Tel became Teesside Tel in December. Boro have gleaned 27 points in that period with only the top six claiming more. Yet, with the survival mission yet to be accomplished, supporters and players are already fretting over what happens next: will he stay or will he go? </p> <p>Half-measures clearly will not do. \"People have been talking about Terry doing two days a week, but that would be no good,\" said Ince. \"He would have to be here every day. You can't run a big club part-time. </p> <p>\"We need to know that he's committed. We don't want a coaching consultant and, for that matter, we don't want him back here for just another 12 months. He has to sign a four- or five-year contract because we have to address the long-term future of the club. We all hope he'll stay.\" </p> <p>In the meantime, the quest for safety stutters on away from the Riverside. Boro have won only three times at home all season and against United they lapsed into over-caution, selecting five natural central halves. The champions' second string hardly broke into a trot, strolling around the Riverside oozing invincibility. Had United not won so easily, Boro's relegation rivals might have had cause to complain. </p> <p>Phil Neville set them on their way after four minutes. The younger Neville's lame goalscoring record rivals only his brother's in United's ranks, but even Beckham would have been proud of the thunderous shot that flew past Mark Schwarzer into the net. </p> <p>It took Ince's ongoing midfield tussles with Nicky Butt -\"Put them in the middle of the park and the least you'll get is an argument,\" said Alex Ferguson - to spark the home side into life. </p> <p>Yet the best chance came and went in the midst of their best attacking spell. Jason Gavin's 67th-minute volley was tipped on to the bar and Hamilton Ricard nodded goalwards. The ball would have crept over the line but the over-eager Ugo Ehiogu intervened; instead of goal celebrations, his touch merely prompted the offside flag. </p> <p>United responded to their uncharacteristic sloppiness by introducing Ryan Giggs and Andy Cole from their mouth-watering bench. The Welshman duly sent Boro defenders scurrying and cut back for Beckham to shoot inside Schwarzer's near post. </p> <p> The former Bradford City forward deserved better with two well-struck shots and was Boro's most potent attacker. \"He's cool on the ball and a threat on goal,\" said Venables of his \u00a3650,000 signing. </p> <p><strong> Best moment:</strong> Having gathered the ball on the edge of the area, he nutmegged Michael Stewart before fizzing a shot inches wide. </p> <p><strong>Man of the match:</strong> Dean Windass</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Boro have won only three times at home all season and against United they lapsed into over-caution, selecting five natural central halves. The champions' second string hardly broke into a trot, strolling around the Riverside oozing invincibility. Had United not won so easily, Boro's relegation rivals might have had cause to complain. Phil Neville set them on their way after four minutes. The younger Neville's lame goalscoring record rivals only his brother's in United's ranks, but even Beckham would have been proud of the thunderous shot that flew past Mark Schwarzer into the net. It took Ince's ongoing midfield tussles with Nicky Butt -\"Put them in the middle of the park and the least you'll get is an argument,\" said Alex Ferguson - to spark the home side into life. Yet the best chance came and went in the midst of their best attacking spell. Jason Gavin's 67th-minute volley was tipped on to the bar and Hamilton Ricard nodded goalwards. The ball would have crept over the line but the over-eager Ugo Ehiogu intervened; instead of goal celebrations, his touch merely prompted the offside flag. United responded to their uncharacteristic sloppiness by introducing Ryan Giggs and Andy Cole from their mouth-watering bench. The Welshman duly sent Boro defenders scurrying and cut back for Beckham to shoot inside Schwarzer's near post. The former Bradford City forward deserved better with two well-struck shots and was Boro's most potent attacker. \"He's cool on the ball and a threat on goal,\" said Venables of his \u00a3650,000 signing. Best moment: Having gathered the ball on the edge of the area, he nutmegged Michael Stewart before fizzing a shot inches wide.

Johan Mjallby got behind his marker, Tore Andre Flo, to redirect a free-kick across the face of the Rangers goal, but with no takers. Significantly, Lubomir Moravcik's first goal in the 61st minute came from a free-kick rolled into the inside-left channel and held up long enough by Henrik Larsson for the Rangers defence to part as Moravcik burst through. His second required taking a long ball under control, turning Fernando Ricksen and keeping his cool to slot the ball home from an angle. Larsson needed to overcome an even tighter angle to squeeze the ball past Stefan Klos, whom he had rounded first. By now, Celtic had not only drawn the sting from the game but could afford to let slip a couple of further opportunities, not least a three-on-one attack that found the young substitute Sean Maloney quickly realising the significance of the occasion as he shot straight at the goalkeeper. Man of the Match : Lubomir Moravcik (Celtic). # \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say. Send your comments, as sharp or as stupid as you like, to football.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk",

While we may applaud Manchester United's achievement in wrapping up, earlier than ever, their seventh title in nine seasons, isn't it much more fun to delight in the exploits of the unfancied? </p> <p>When the fixture lists were published last summer, who would have thought that the semi-final of Europe's premier club competition would be all about the United of Leeds rather than Manchester. If that wasn't unlikely enough, what about the thought that tonight's game between Charlton and Ipswich will have an important bearing on Champions League qualification? </p> <p>Yet both Leeds and Ipswich have confounded their critics. While the clubs differ in many ways - not least in terms of history and financial clout - their surprise achievements have been accomplished with a simple philosophy, based on a collective work ethic and refusal to be intimidated by reputations of more experienced contemporaries. </p> <p>At Ipswich, the key has been to collect a team devoid of stars. Of those who would expect to be selected for the first team, only two have come from other Premiership clubs. And those two, Chris Makin (Sunderland) and Alun Armstrong (Middlesbrough) found themselves out of favour where they were. </p> <p>The rest have come from abroad, from the Nationwide league or through the ranks. In all cases, Ipswich have given them their big chance. And boy, are they grateful. Even Marcus Stewart, who is challenging for this season's golden boot, was doubted by many when he arrived. </p> <p>That gratitude translates into all that they do. Few Premiership clubs are more obliging or more helpful when it comes to granting interviews, which the players to a man undertake willingly and happily, as they do the enormous amounts of community work they undertake. </p> <p>This attitude to hospitality, which was fostered by the free-flowing days of the Cobbold era, has been continued by the present administration, headed by David Sheepshanks. When the new England manager visited Portman Road earlier this season, Sheepshanks went out of his way to learn the Swedish for \"tractor boys\" so Sven could feel at home. </p> <p>It all makes a difference, on and off the pitch. And when I suggested to George Burley earlier this month after their win at Southampton, that the Champions League was a possibility, the swift \"behave yourself\" that he shot me was belied by the twinkle in his eye. </p> <p>Europe is an immediate reality for Leeds and although the clubs might be quite different - paying \u00a318m for a defender is not in Sheepshanks' immediate plans - they have much in common. </p> <p>Although big name players have arrived for big money, Leeds represents a huge opportunity for them in the way Ipswich does to Burley's men. The core of the side have grown up together and they have been joined by young, talented players with a point to prove. </p> <p>First and foremost, they want to play for each other, anywhere they are wanted - just think of how many positions Dominic Matteo has filled this year. </p> <p>This season has been extraordinary in many ways for the club, with injuries and a high-profile court case. But such is their ambition on the field that they have just played harder for each other. They also don't seem to want to do so anywhere other than Leeds. </p> <p>When I spoke to Ian Harte last week about whether he might be off to Newcastle or even abroad, he looked at me as though I was mad. Why, he said, would I want to play anywhere other than Leeds? </p> <p>It is this fearsome devotion to the cause and the braveness of youth which has nothing to fear which has propelled Leeds past Milan, Anderlecht, Lazio and Deportivo. It may yet also get them past Valencia, starting with the first leg of their semi-final this week, while Ipswich will be hoping that the same spirit will get them to the same competition next year. </p> <p>Although that may be open to doubt, the one certainty is that you won't find Ipswich or Leeds players in the papers moaning about how things have to change or how they have to move on. Even Sir Alex Ferguson must be jealous of that. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

This attitude to hospitality, which was fostered by the free-flowing days of the Cobbold era, has been continued by the present administration, headed by David Sheepshanks. When the new England manager visited Portman Road earlier this season, Sheepshanks went out of his way to learn the Swedish for \"tractor boys\" so Sven could feel at home. It all makes a difference, on and off the pitch. And when I suggested to George Burley earlier this month after their win at Southampton, that the Champions League was a possibility, the swift \"behave yourself\" that he shot me was belied by the twinkle in his eye. Europe is an immediate reality for Leeds and although the clubs might be quite different - paying \u00a318m for a defender is not in Sheepshanks' immediate plans - they have much in common. Although big name players have arrived for big money, Leeds represents a huge opportunity for them in the way Ipswich does to Burley's men. The core of the side have grown up together and they have been joined by young, talented players with a point to prove. First and foremost, they want to play for each other, anywhere they are wanted - just think of how many positions Dominic Matteo has filled this year. This season has been extraordinary in many ways for the club, with injuries and a high-profile court case. But such is their ambition on the field that they have just played harder for each other. They also don't seem to want to do so anywhere other than Leeds. When I spoke to Ian Harte last week about whether he might be off to Newcastle or even abroad, he looked at me as though I was mad. Why, he said, would I want to play anywhere other than Leeds? It is this fearsome devotion to the cause and the braveness of youth which has nothing to fear which has propelled Leeds past Milan, Anderlecht, Lazio and Deportivo. It may yet also get them past Valencia, starting with the first leg of their semi-final this week, while Ipswich will be hoping that the same spirit will get them to the same competition next year. Although that may be open to doubt, the one certainty is that you won't find Ipswich or Leeds players in the papers moaning about how things have to change or how they have to move on. Even Sir Alex Ferguson must be jealous of that. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say. Send your comments, as sharp or as stupid as you like, to football.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk",

Lucy and John put me up again on Saturday evening and took me to Cheltenham beach and on to Devenport for fish and chips. Thanks again to them. </p> <p> By Sunday afternoon I was on the plane to Buenos Aires and due to arrive there at Sunday lunchtime. What a strange thing time is - I can't get my head around it at all. My body was also struggling with two Sundays and an 11-hour flight: I couldn't sleep on the plane and arrived at my chosen hotel via shuttle bus and taxi feeling very frazzled. The hotel was a ghastly dump, smelling of bottled gas and miles from the centre of the city. Beware website descriptions - for 'laundry' read large sink; for 'kitchen' read gas ring with no kettle, pans or crockery; for 'social area' read ancient settee in foyer; and for 'English spoken' read lie. I didn't have the energy to move hotels at that point, so I lugged all my bags up the umpteen flights of stairs, gathered what reserves I had and set out on the subte (underground) for the city centre. </p> <p> As it was Sunday and Argentina is a good Catholic country, virtually everywhere was shut. However, I did manage to check out a couple of alternative accommodation possibilities and order a pizza: long live international food. I went back to the dump before it got too dark and collapsed into bed. 11 hours later I woke refreshed enough to claim my free McDonalds breakfast, and check out and move into a slightly less grotty hotel right in the centre. </p> <p> The next couple of days were spent exploring Buenos Aires. I discovered that for some reason the whole city smells of bottled gas. I found a travel agent, Amichi, which had English-speaking reps, and booked a four-day trip to the Iguazu Falls - a must, according to Cheryl. The Plaza de Mayo was interesting: it's the equivalent of Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, with lots of political banners and photos of what I presume are 'the missing', as well as lots of police. I also managed to buy a new spare pair of reading glasses - having already broken one pair, I was terrified of damaging the others and ending up stuck somewhere unable to read a thing. </p> <p> I like Buenos Aires - it's a vibrant city, despite the narrow roads choked with traffic. The city is scruffy, the people smart. The Argentines seem to have an obsession with shiny shoes. Every street corner has a shoe-shine man, always with a customer, which thankfully means they don't feel the need to tout (unlike in Asia, where they try to shine your shoes even if you're wearing flip-flops). I'm a lover of caf\u00e9s where I can sit with a coffee and people-watch, and there are enough in Buenos Aires to satisfy even me. They always provide a little biscuit or pastry too, which is nice. </p> <p> My Spanish isn't really improving. I'm OK if I have time to prepare what I want to say, but unexpected encounters seem to drive the words out of my head. I've managed to get please, thankyou, sorry and toilet? off pat. </p> <p> The trip to Iguazu was a bit hairy. The small local airport was packed, and nobody spoke English. By dint of a great deal of guesswork I did manage to get onto the plane and then the transfer bus, where lots of instructions and details of trips were given out - all in Spanish. I did eventually find a couple from York, travelling with Argentine friends, who promised to pass on anything important. The hotel was actually in Brazil and, topically, everyone had to get out at the border and walk through some antiseptic as a precaution against foot and mouth. A lady in thin sandals met with short shrift when she tried to walk round the edge. Although the trip was expensive (we were staying in a four-star hotel), I nevertheless decided to fork out a bit more to go to see The Spectacular, a show of music and dancing from Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay (the borders of all three countries meet here). It was a bit glitzy, but Bruce had a whale of a time when one of the Brazilian dancers took a shine to him (see photo). </p> <p> The next morning we headed off to the Iguazu Falls. We visited the Argentinian side first, where 30 rivers meet and, over the space of 2,400m, plunge down 275 falls. It was an amazing sight - water crashing down into the rainforest for as far as the eye could see, falling so far and so fast that it sent up a huge spray. Every corner we turned during our walk revealing yet more impressive falls. I had four floppy discs for my camera with me, and soon filled the lot.</p> <p> In the afternoon I paid out yet more money to go on the Great Adventure - a truck ride through the forest to the river and then a dinghy-ride to the falls. The first adventure came when the truck broke down and we had to walk through the last section of the forest to the river. Those who wanted them were issued with plastic bags to put over their shoes while they were walking through the red mud - quite a sight. Then we were packed into the dinghy for the mile-long ride through the rapids. This time the adrenalin really did flow as we sped past angry whirlpools and vicious rocks until we found ourselves in the middle of the seething cauldron at the base of one of the falls. From there we plunged on round a bend and virtually straight under another fall - this we did twice as we all demanded to go again. The thunderous roar of the falls, the drenching spray and the tossing boat made us all shout with exhilaration - it was fantastic. </p> <p> The evening was spent drying out and agonising over which photos to delete to leave some space for the Brazilian side the next day. </p> <p> I hadn't thought anything would be able to live up to the sights of the previous day - but I was wrong. At one point there was a walkway in front of a huge collection of falls. It was worth a second drenching to stand there and look at it in awe. I took a five-second video to try to give a better idea of the magnitude of the place, but even that didn't show the 180 degrees of solid falls behind me, where the spray was too intense to take pictures. The sun came out at this moment to produce a rainbow - magic (watch Sue's video). </p> <p> By lunchtime all the other English speakers had left. Luckily Pedro, a young Argentine (who unfortunately didn't speak English either) appointed himself as my guide and minder. At the falls he was sent out to find me as the bus wanted to leave - how was I to know? We went on to see the 8km Itiapu dam which is the largest power station in the world, supplying most of Paraguay and Brazil's electricity. Impressive, but no match for nature's work down the road. Thanks for the tip Cheryl, it was a truly wondrous place. </p> <p> I lazed about by the pool in the morning before flying back to Buenos Aires this afternoon. I'm writing my report now, a day late, as I refused to pay the hotel's exorbitant internet charge. I fly off to Santiago tomorrow, sad that I have barely glimpsed Argentina. As yet I have no idea how I'm going to spend these last five weeks travelling through Chile, Bolivia and Peru, but I'm sure I'll work it out somehow. I do know that my lack of Spanish is a definite drawback, although I was pleased with myself for managing to telephone to book a room in Santiago for Sunday night. I had an email from a Santiago resident but have somehow lost the address, which is a pity. So, I have survived and enjoyed my first week in South America - I wonder what the next one will bring.</p>",

I had an email from a Santiago resident but have somehow lost the address, which is a pity. So, I have survived and enjoyed my first week in South America - I wonder what the next one will bring.",

Shadow environment secretary Archie Norman also pledged to make it easier for councils to give more land green belt protection. The Conservatives have campaigned against rural development through out this parliament, but this is first time it has pledged to scrap targets within weeks of the election.

Labour is likely to react by pointing to the Conservatives own poor record on protecting the countryside, not least from out-of-town supermarkets of the kind built by Mr Norman's previous employer, Asda.

Audiences so far have been modest, because the script is somewhat confusing, but it's worth persevering with: it's a classic farce rich in irony and paradox and by the end of the it you'll be rolling in the aisles. </p> <p>The central character is complex: a charming, very successful businessman, with a ruthless record as corporate raider and a rags-to-riches background. The plot may seem a little obscure since it involves a small corner of government. But add in millions of unexpected extra dosh released by the Treasury, along with the corporate decision to take the public service ethos by the scruff of its neck, and Gerry's Smash and Grab is a tale for our times. </p> <p>It opened in mid-March when Gerry Robinson (chairman of the Arts Council) launched a dawn raid on the England's 10 regional arts boards (RABs). He was freshly glowing from having wowed Gordon Brown (who plays a cameo role) with his Granada-Compass history of efficiency and cost-cutting contract catering to wrestle the biggest budget out of the Treasury in memory. A fat \u00a3100m was swilling about for the arts, and with the plaudits still ringing in his ears, Robinson pounced. </p> <p>The action is pacy and full of surprises. Plans were drawn up in secret and sprung on astonished RABs, which were given six weeks to hand over all their staff contracts and assets to Gerry. The six weeks are up today and no one has handed over anything. Now there's a twist in the plot Gerry wasn't expecting: a debate in the Commons on Wednesday amid general uproar. </p> <p>The script has been a virtually incomprehensible document, the Prospectus for Change, which is liberally sprinkled with keywords such as \"modern\" and \"new\". This is supposed to explain to the RABs' several hundred staff and thousands of artists whom they help what the purpose of the upheaval is all about. The idea is one national arts organisation with regional offices. A sweetener was added for the RABs: we may be abolishing you, but you'll get bigger budgets. </p> <p>Confused by now as to what Gerry's up to? Well, you're in good company. Eight out of the 10 RABs are in a state of outraged rebellion. Instead of arts administrators getting on with their jobs, they're all in meetings trying to puzzle out what the prospectus means and what they should do about it. </p> <p>Arts Council staff are zipping about the country try ing to explain the inexplicable prospectus to angry meetings of the arts community and the public. Gerry's apparatchiks are trying to pour oil on very troubled waters and, six weeks too late, they are lavishing soothing words about consultation and devolution on the ruffled regional sensitivities. </p> <p>In the midst of this muddle there are three things on which the prospectus is clear. First, while it primly insists that this is not primarily a cost-cutting exercise, it admits that saving money will be one of the results. Second, it is honest about jobs: yes, there will be some job losses; yes, some could be compulsory redundancies; and yes, all redundancy agreements will have to be renegotiated. </p> <p>Third and most importantly, whatever else this prospectus hopes to achieve, one thing is clear: it talks of a national \"single voice\" for the arts. It's the idea of Robinson with a loud-hailer that has really freaked out the RABs, who pride themselves on having built up distinctive and accountable regionalism. Local authorities are incensed at the high-handedness with which Robinson's plans sweep them aside. </p> <p>This is the most contentious issue. Even Chris Smith at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport has made his nervousness clear in a conveniently leaked letter. The suspicion is that the Labour luvvies have nobbled Robinson, complaining of bureaucracy, and, as one northerner admitted, the Antony Gormleys and Anish Kapoors of this world would much prefer to deal straight with the bigwigs in London. Where the RABs play a crucial role is in building up and developing the work of local artists and communities who are unlikely to get to bend Robinson's ear. </p> <p>It's the same hook New Labour gets caught on every time. All its rhetoric is to devolve, but its instincts are to centralise. After the Livingston/Morgan debacles in London and Wales, the talk is of having learnt lessons, but the Arts Council is flying in the face of this, defending its plans for this \"single voice\" on the grounds that artists should be able to expect consistency in arts policy across the country. </p> <p>But is consistency such a prize that it's worth sacrificing local accountability and regional devolvement for it? The bitter irony is that New Labour is finishing off the work begun by the Tories in their mid-80s centralising spree when the power to appoint the RABs' chairs was shifted from the regions to the secretary of state. </p> <p>Dawn raids may be good drama but they don't work in the public sector. The first sentence of the prospectus says that all the restructuring would be carried out swiftly while \"consultation and implementation\" would come in the second stage. Nothing now is going to happen swiftly, the sides are digging in for a long trench war. Meanwhile the trust between London and the regions (never high) has been spectacularly spent. This could end up a tragedy. </p> <p>madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com</p>",

Third and most importantly, whatever else this prospectus hopes to achieve, one thing is clear: it talks of a national \"single voice\" for the arts. It's the idea of Robinson with a loud-hailer that has really freaked out the RABs, who pride themselves on having built up distinctive and accountable regionalism. Local authorities are incensed at the high-handedness with which Robinson's plans sweep them aside. This is the most contentious issue. Even Chris Smith at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport has made his nervousness clear in a conveniently leaked letter. The suspicion is that the Labour luvvies have nobbled Robinson, complaining of bureaucracy, and, as one northerner admitted, the Antony Gormleys and Anish Kapoors of this world would much prefer to deal straight with the bigwigs in London. Where the RABs play a crucial role is in building up and developing the work of local artists and communities who are unlikely to get to bend Robinson's ear. It's the same hook New Labour gets caught on every time. All its rhetoric is to devolve, but its instincts are to centralise. After the Livingston/Morgan debacles in London and Wales, the talk is of having learnt lessons, but the Arts Council is flying in the face of this, defending its plans for this \"single voice\" on the grounds that artists should be able to expect consistency in arts policy across the country. But is consistency such a prize that it's worth sacrificing local accountability and regional devolvement for it? The bitter irony is that New Labour is finishing off the work begun by the Tories in their mid-80s centralising spree when the power to appoint the RABs' chairs was shifted from the regions to the secretary of state. Dawn raids may be good drama but they don't work in the public sector. The first sentence of the prospectus says that all the restructuring would be carried out swiftly while \"consultation and implementation\" would come in the second stage. Nothing now is going to happen swiftly, the sides are digging in for a long trench war. Meanwhile the trust between London and the regions (never high) has been spectacularly spent. This could end up a tragedy. madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com",

According to Professor Rhodes, the ESRC is \u00d0 perhaps inadvertently \u00d0 pressuring professors to move away from qualitative long-term research and towards working in the short term to find policy implications. \"There is a recent trend around the notion of relevance. The ESRC looks over its shoulder too much at its paymasters, the government, and wants to inform its policy. It's skewing the system,\" Professor Rhodes. Professor Rhodes felt the problem most acutely when studying the civil service. Government employees all agreed that his research did not need to be directly targeted towards government policy, but the ESRC continued to contact him asking about 'relevance'. The ESRC does not agree that it is skewing the research agenda. A spokesperson said that, although much of their funding was organised through programmes and centres, a significant proportion is awarded through open competition for grants. But other political scientists agree that the funding structure may have affected research, even if they would not go as far as Professor Rhodes does. Professor Vernon Bogdanor from Oxford University said that, although the quality of research had not necessarily been affected, he believes that, over the last 10 years, researchers have been pushed into working in groups rather than following their individual interests. Professor Rhodes believes that the ESRC attitude has to change. \"It seems to me a recipe for disaster. It may sound old fashioned, but I believe the best way political scientists can change government policy is to do quality research.\"",

      "bodyText": "The neglected elder sibling of pedagogical research \u00d0 the study of higher education teaching \u00d0 is finally getting serious. Professor Noel Entwistle from Edinburgh University is taking 30 years of study about the primary factors that make a good teacher into 25 departments at Edinburgh, Coventry and Durham to look at what kind of improvements such an understanding can make to the way students learn. A four-year grant just awarded by the Economic and Social Research Council is making the work by a team of nine researchers possible. The group will first study lecturers\u00d5 technique, suggest and discuss potential changes, and then study what impact those alterations make. Professor Entwistle\u00d5s main message is very simple: how lecturers teach makes an enormous difference to the performance of their students. At the most extreme, the method of evaluation used with students directly affects how they learn. For example, multiple-choice exams can, if they are the only form of assessment, lead students to prioritise shallower fact-based learning over deeper reasoning. Similarly, different approaches to everything from lecturing or marking through to behaviour make a huge difference to student progress. \"Many lecturers feel the research into student learning is generic and that it doesn\u00d5t apply to them. In some ways, that\u00d5s true. \"By working with individual departments, we\u00d5re hoping we develop ways in which the teaching and learning environment could be improved in ways that we haven\u00d5t thought of yet,\" Professor Entwistle said. The task that the Edinburgh team has undertaken is daunting, they are looking at 25 departments from various disciplines over nearly half a decade. Very few studies of higher education teaching have been undertaken on that scale in this country. But, it might require exactly that kind of magnitude to improve our understanding and to make academics around the country take notice of advances in pedagogical research. And Professor Entwistle\u00d5s work is getting other researchers very excited. Professor Charles Desforges, director of the ESRC\u00d5s teaching and learning research programme said, \"his research is recognised as world class and he has built up a systematic picture of the drivers of quality teaching and learning.\"",

The second is a notice emblazoned on the wall reading: \"Our dream is a world free of poverty.\" </p> <p>To which the snap response is: dream on. As the Bank is honest enough to admit, there is a very long way to go before global poverty is eradicated. The litany of horrific statistics is well known: 20% of the world's 6bn people live on less than a dollar a day, almost half on less than $2 a day; 10m children under five die each year from preventable diseases; half a million mothers die in childbirth from complications that could have been prevented with access to proper care; 113m children never go to school. </p> <p>That is the magnitude of the problem. Nicholas Stern, the Bank's chief economist, calls them sobering figures and he is absolutely right. Stern also believes there is reason for hope, and he is right about that as well. \"If developing countries, donor countries, and international organisations can work together with urgency, hundreds of millions of people will then have the opportunities to escape severe deprivation.\" </p> <p>Inevitably, this will be a slow process, and the frustrations will be many. The reality is that the sort of changes demanded by campaign groups requirepolicy shifts by the rich and powerful countries that together make the big decisions affecting the global economy. This does not happen overnight but takes time and patience. </p> <p><strong> New sensitivity</strong><br> </p> <p>The encouraging news is that progress is being made. The international organisations, the politicians and the campaigners in non-governmental organisations now all agree about what they should be aiming to achieve: hitting the development goals set by the United Nations in the mid-90s. Both the Bank and the International Monetary Fund have changed over the past 10 years, in part because their previous strategies did not work, but also because the governments of the countries that control the institutions have responded to public pressure for change. </p> <p>The communiqu\u00e9 released by the leading industrial nations on Saturday committed the G7 to work on a health initiative to tackle tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/Aids, and to ensure that the debts of the poor countries are sustainable. There is a sensitivity to global issues in the developed world that was not evident at international meetings even four or five years ago, with this mood reflected in the commitment to the UN development goals. </p> <p>Achieving these targets would involve halving the number of people living in poverty, cutting infant mortality by two-thirds and putting every child in school. Enshrining the development goals as central to the work of the Bank and the Fund is a big step forward, and its significance should not be underestimated. </p> <p>While there is plenty of unanimity about ends, there is less of a consensus when it comes to means. In theory, it looks so simple. Those countries that have made the most rapid progress towards eliminating poverty in recent decades have also been those that have enjoyed the most rapid growth.</p> <p>The number of people living on less than a dollar a day in China has fallen from 92m in 1990 to 54m in 1998, and is expected to fall to 9m by 2015. Why? Because per capita incomes are rising at 6-7% a year. In sub-Saharan Africa, where real incomes fell in 1997-98 and 1998-99, according to the Bank's data, the trend is in the opposite direction. Faster growth creates extra resources that can be spent on social and transport infrastructure, which in turn helps attract foreign capital, making the growth process self-reinforcing. </p> <p>The advantage that China has is its size. With a population of 1.3bn, it is a potential market no global business can ignore, and is comfortably the biggest recipient of foreign direct investment among developing countries. Sub-Saharan Africa has none of China's advantages. Many of its countries are too poor to create the pool of savings necessary to finance investment, and foreign direct investment is hard to attract. </p> <p>Debt relief is one way of providing poor countries with extra resources to kick-start growth. Money saved can be recycled into spending on health and education, which are now seen as the building blocks of development. </p> <p>The Bank and the Fund believe that they have almost reached the end of the road with debt relief, and that the next step is for poor countries to improve the quality of their governance and liberalise their markets. Trade openness is seen as crucial if real incomes are to grow fast enough to reduce poverty levels. Poor countries should reduce their tariffs, rich countries should dismantle their protectionist regimes. The G7 is concerned that a new round of trade liberalisation talks is launched in Qatar later this year, something that is looking increasingly unlikely given divisions among the rich countries and opposition from developing countries. </p> <p>The argument in favour of a round is that without one there will be a further retreat from multi-lateralism into regionalism and protectionism. This is certainly a risk, and there are those - such as international development secretary Clare Short - who believe that the way forward should be for the developing countries to agree to talks being started while retaining the right not to sign up to an inadequate deal. </p> <p><strong> Supply-side rigidities</strong><br> </p> <p>Organisations such as the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) believe, however, that poor countries should not sign up to fresh talks until some outstanding issues from the last round - market access, the new regimes on intellectual property rights and investment measures - have been cleared up. </p> <p>Unctad's annual report last week noted that because of supply-side rigidities \"African LDCs [less developed countries] that rely on exports of only one or two primary commodities cannot take full advantage of global expansion by increasing their export volumes, while they often bear the full brunt of commodity price declines\". </p> <p>James Wolfensohn, World Bank president, said last week debt relief was not a silver bullet that would solve all the problems of poor countries. The same applies to trade. Historically, it is completely untrue that liberalising trade provided the engine for economic development. It was not true of the United States, which industrialised behind massive tariff barriers erected in the 19th century to keep out competition from more efficient British firms. Nor was it true of Japan or the Asian tigers in the decades after the second world war. Nor is it true of China today. </p> <p>The economist Dani Rodrik says: \"Countries that have achieved long-term economic growth have usually combined the opportunities offered by world markets with a growth strategy that mobilises the capabilities of domestic institutions.\" In other words, it may be that strong economies lead to trade, rather than the other way round. </p> <p>Those campaigning for a better deal for developing countries see trade as one of the big issues for the coming years. There are three others. </p> <p>The first is the need to keep up the fight on debt, where recent efforts meant discussion by the Bank and Fund yesterday about topping up - in exceptional circumstances - the financial help for those poor countries that find the repayments unsustainable even after debt relief. Debt relief has become a war of attrition, but there is more that can be achieved if the pressure is maintained. </p> <p>The second area is aid, where the fine words of rich countries have not been matched by the delivery of extra development assistance. Britain, which has moved up from fifth to fourth in the league table of donors, is an honourable exception, progressing towards the UN's target of 0.7% of GNP, in contrast to retreats elsewhere. </p> <p>Finally, there is the still fragile state of the global economy.

Babies, prisoners and elderly women were slaughtered in superstitious rituals which, until now, have been blamed on Celtic druids.</p> <p>Human remains thought to be from the iron age have been redated to the second century AD, suggesting the image of rational Romans is a myth.</p> <p>\"We are getting some surprises. Killing people for religious reasons was supposed to have been banned by Emperor Augustus,\" said Alison Taylor, of the Institute of Field Archaeologists.</p> <p>Historians have long accepted the official Roman version that the empire banished barbaric customs with a severe but enlightened rule of law.</p> <p>But British bogs have yielded at least 10 bodies from the Roman period which were bludgeoned, garrotted, slashed across the throat and beheaded.

      "bodyText": "Imperial Romans practised human sacrifices and head-hunting in ancient Britain while hiding behind the facade of civilising the natives, according to new research. Dismembered bodies found in British sites show that the colonisers secretly flouted their own laws by killing humans to appease the gods. Babies, prisoners and elderly women were slaughtered in superstitious rituals which, until now, have been blamed on Celtic druids. Human remains thought to be from the iron age have been redated to the second century AD, suggesting the image of rational Romans is a myth. \"We are getting some surprises. Killing people for religious reasons was supposed to have been banned by Emperor Augustus,\" said Alison Taylor, of the Institute of Field Archaeologists. Historians have long accepted the official Roman version that the empire banished barbaric customs with a severe but enlightened rule of law. But British bogs have yielded at least 10 bodies from the Roman period which were bludgeoned, garrotted, slashed across the throat and beheaded. The victims were mostly well nourished and some showed signs of struggle. Heads were placed at the feet, between the legs or upside down above the neck. \"It is a fairly consistent pattern. The practice went on for a long time and in a systematic way,\" Mrs Taylor said. A lead tablet from a Roman temple at Brandon, Suffolk, was inscribed: \"He is sacrificed to the lord Neptune with hazel.\" Skulls excavated from the Walbrook, a dried-up stream near the Thames, show that at least six victims were decapitated and their heads left as votive offerings. Bones have been discovered in ditches near temples and at the bottom of ritual wells. A shrine in Cambridge also contained the remains of babies and dogs. Parents who could not afford to raise a child could legally kill a newborn, usually by exposure, but the temple discoveries suggest that some were killed as sacrifices. Unlike the Celts, who practised a form of nature worship, the Romans had a pantheon of gods. At times of stress, such as war or disease, it was common to placate them with animal sacrifices. The human victims, who were likely to be considered dispensable, would have included criminals, prisoners of war, elderly women and infants. Romans believed the future could be divined in death throes. \"The more painful, graphic and lingering the death the easier it would be to see the future,\" Mrs Taylor said. The British School at Rome is planning to publish her research, along with other papers presented at a conference last month called Roman Bodies. It has also emerged that the Roman army under Emperor Trajan developed a fetish for head-hunting: a custom supposedly restricted to barbarians. Nic Fields, a historian at the University of Edinburgh, said Romans were titillated and horrified by stories about the Gauls' atrocities, but absorbed their habits. \"The idea was to take the enemy's strength, please your warrior gods and flaunt battlefield prowess,\" he said. A relief in Trajan's column, erected in Rome in the second century AD to commemorate the emperor's campaigns in Romania, shows a head swinging from the teeth of a soldier hacking at his next victim. Another relief on the Arch of Constantine shows Trajan accepting a head offered by one of his bodyguards. Revered by many historians as perhaps the best emperor, he is also shown on a coin standing on the head of a defeated opponent. \"Rome was supposed to have stamped out this sort of thing, but here we have a barbarian custom celebrated in officially commissioned monuments and coins,\" Dr Fields said. The soldiers depicted in the reliefs appear to be dismounted cavalrymen and therefore probably mercenaries, but there is evidence that legionaries too were head-hunters.",

      "bodyText": "Leaders of the richest nations yesterday agreed to bankroll a multibillion dollar fund for new drugs and vaccines against HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria in some of the poorest countries. The fund, worth an estimated $3bn-$4bn (\u00a32bn-\u00a32.7bn), will pay for drugs and treatments that already exist as well as for research into new vaccines. Debt campaigners have argued that the richest countries, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have failed to help poor countries increasingly crippled by the spread of such diseases. Yesterday's agreement was designed to show that the developed world is taking the health crisis seriously. There was a heavy police presence outside as politicians and diplomats met in Washington, amid anti-globalisation demonstrations. Against the furore over high prices charged by pharmaceutical companies for drugs to treat HIV/Aids and other deadly viruses, the fund will offer an incentive to the companies to carry out research and development work for poor consumers. The US is understood to have earmarked $1bn for the fund, although officials still have to convince some members of the Bush administration that the infrastructure needed to spend the money is in place. Campaign groups welcomed the fund yesterday but warned that more should be done to provide debt relief for poor countries struggling to pay for healthcare. Two leading IMF committees agreed to consider additional debt relief for countries in exceptional circumstances. This could be a step towards allowing the cost of dealing with epidemics to be set against debt repayments. Sub-Saharan Africa pays $13.5bn in debt repayments each year. Adrian Lovett, of the campaign group Drop the Debt, said: \"Creditors have today admitted they will have to take further action on debt because of emergencies like Aids. The cat is now out of the bag.\" Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, has said that between $7bn and $10bn is needed to pay for treatment in developing countries. The World Bank, which met alongside the IMF at the weekend, expects to take charge of distributing the money to drugs companies and poor nations. James Wolfensohn, the bank's president, has said the need to tackle health problems in developing countries is a priority for his organisation. Nicholas Stern, its chief economist, said rich countries had to lower trade barriers and increase aid if the goal of reducing by half the number of people living in extreme poverty was to be met by 2015.

Rupert Everett, Judi Dench and Reese Witherspoon are also among the stars of the $15m [\u00a310m] movie, which has already begun shooting. In the 40s and 50s, Ealing became a byword for a typically English style of comedy, with the likes of Passport to Pimlico and Kind Hearts and Coronets.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 The classic Ealing comedy name is to be revived, with Colin Firth starring in the first film made there for 40 years. A new production of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Ernest will be the first film to be released under the west London studio's banner since 1957. Rupert Everett, Judi Dench and Reese Witherspoon are also among the stars of the $15m [\u00a310m] movie, which has already begun shooting. In the 40s and 50s, Ealing became a byword for a typically English style of comedy, with the likes of Passport to Pimlico and Kind Hearts and Coronets. The new movie is due be released next year. \u0095 Anthony Hopkins has upset locals in Prague by filming a high speed chase around the city's largest cemetery for his new movie, Black Sheep. Hopkins also upset locals by parking his trailer in the crematorium. Local resident Jan Stolzar told Ananova: \"It may be a comedy but none of us are laughing. We want to be able to visit the cemetery in peace and quiet, not have it turned into Disneyland.\" Hopkins plays a CIA agent in the film, which also stars comedian Chris Rock. \u0095 Courtney Love is to play a serial killer in the screen adaptation of the novel 24 Hours, to be directed by Luis Mandoki.

      "body": "<p>Paternalistic work environments should be consigned to history, according to disability rights campaigners.</p> <p>In tune with the times, the government has been responding with new measures aimed at putting disabled workers alongside other able-bodied workers in the community. But there are fears that these may mean that some disabled people employed by local authorities will be in danger of losing their jobs. Under new regulations, councils are no longer required to help fund sheltered workplaces. </p> <p>From this month on, individual authorities are no longer required to pay 25% towards the cost of sheltered workplaces. At a time when many local authority social services departments are under pressure to make savings to deal with overspends, there are growing concerns that one casualty may be the jobs that are currently offered to disabled workers.</p> <p>At Gloucestershire county council, the social services department needs to make savings of \u00a36.5m out of a budget of \u00a388.5m. One option is to make around 50 disabled people, who are employed at the council's industrial units, redundant. The units, Gloucester Industrial Services (GIS), employ more than 200 people working on reconditioning wheelchairs and making double-glazed windows. </p> <p>\"The government is not placing the same conditions on us to joint-fund sheltered workshops as it did in the past,\" says Mark Branton, assistant director of social services.</p> <p>\"It is placing targets on us that are about moving disabled people into real employment in the private sector, as opposed to real employment within the units.

      "bodyText": "Paternalistic work environments should be consigned to history, according to disability rights campaigners. In tune with the times, the government has been responding with new measures aimed at putting disabled workers alongside other able-bodied workers in the community. But there are fears that these may mean that some disabled people employed by local authorities will be in danger of losing their jobs. Under new regulations, councils are no longer required to help fund sheltered workplaces. From this month on, individual authorities are no longer required to pay 25% towards the cost of sheltered workplaces. At a time when many local authority social services departments are under pressure to make savings to deal with overspends, there are growing concerns that one casualty may be the jobs that are currently offered to disabled workers. At Gloucestershire county council, the social services department needs to make savings of \u00a36.5m out of a budget of \u00a388.5m. One option is to make around 50 disabled people, who are employed at the council's industrial units, redundant. The units, Gloucester Industrial Services (GIS), employ more than 200 people working on reconditioning wheelchairs and making double-glazed windows. \"The government is not placing the same conditions on us to joint-fund sheltered workshops as it did in the past,\" says Mark Branton, assistant director of social services. \"It is placing targets on us that are about moving disabled people into real employment in the private sector, as opposed to real employment within the units. The impact of that is that there isn't the same requirement for us to be providing subsidised employment.\" And, he points out: \"That means that we have to consider whether we should keep a sheltered industrial unit, when most of the government's strategy, in terms of the welfare to work programme, is finding work for disabled people in the community. It is not about running sheltered workshops ourselves, and many local authorities no longer run them at all. It is about using that resource occasionally as a way of providing rehabilitation to people.\" Although major providers of employment for disabled people - including Remploy, which currently has over 10,000 disabled employees - agree that the aim should be to see as many disabled people as possible working in the community, they stress that what is needed is more options. \"Although the long-term aim should be to get as many disabled people into the community as possible, there is a need for a range of employment, because we have to recognise that the needs of disabled people are different. At present, not all employers are geared to providing the level of support that some disabled workers need,\" says Ray Fletcher, director of personnel at Remploy. The charities Scope and Mencap also emphasise that, while supporting disabled people's right to acceptance in the workplace is vital, flexibility in what is offered is just as important. Mike Stubley has first hand knowledge of working in a sheltered workplace. He works at GIS as a production superintendent and is disabled himself. He agrees that the broad intention behind the government's strategy for the disabled is correct but argues that the reality for many disabled people is that the kind of sheltered workplace offered at GIS is likely to prove most successful for some disabled people. \"Unfortunately, not everyone is capable of working in open employment.

Many thought he would regret it and be replaced by the mesmerising prophet of racial disharmony and unreconstructed British identity.</p> <p>They were wrong: against odds as grim as Mr Hague faces on June 7 Heath beat Labour\u0092s Harold Wilson in 1970. Powell had to wait until 1974 when he played the Europe card with greater success before he could gleefully hum a Te Deum as the Tories lost. But he lost too and never held office again.</p> <p>Mr Townend is a Powellite, but not a Powell. He never rose higher than chairman of the rightwing backbench pressure group, the 92 group. But for the timing of his remarks and - until he was told to shut up on Sunday - his persistence - his views might have retired quietly with him.</p> <p>So why did Mr Hague not swat him aside immediately ? After all, he took the Tory whip away from another MP poised to leave the Commons, Charles Wardle, on the (disputed) grounds that the MP had threatened to back an independent Tory candidate in Bexhill and Battle.</p> <p>The contrast was a painful one and doomed Mr Hague\u0092s defence of his inaction in the weeks since Mr Townend\u0092s. What was good enough for Mr Wardle (actually it was an injustice) was surely good enough for Mr Townend!</p> <p>No one at Westminster seriously regards the Tory leader as a racist. He is the wrong age, class and educational profile. From the start he made clear that he did not agree with Mr Townend\u0092s tone or content.</p> <p>It is possible, but only just, to claim that his hesitation was prompted by decent instincts, by a broad church tolerance, a desire not to make a mountain out of an ancient East Yorkshire molehill.</p> <p>But it is also possible to argue that party HQ hoped to exploit the ambiguity inherent in Mr Hague\u0092s very public dither. The moderates would be assuaged by his evident distaste for the Bridlington wine merchant\u0092s language, the not-so-covert racists pleased by loud tabloid defence of the MP.</p> <p>Thanks to the awkward Wardle precedent it was never likely to work and rendered Mr Hague\u0092s hopes of peeling minority votes off Labour pretty minimal. The moment Lord Taylor started to cause trouble the prospect collapsed to less than zero. He dare not lose a black barrister , pin-striped suits and all, to Labour. By comparison Shaun Woodward\u0092s defection would have looked a plus with hindsight.</p> <p>In the event the Tories gained nothing in the polls, contrary to what some party officials had hoped. Nor has the asylum controversy done them much good. It will be harder to play it in a loose way now. Attacks on New Labour must be focused on the competence - or lack - of its vetting and admission policies.</p> <p>Whether or not Lord Taylor signs up to the letter of support from minority candidates which Hague aides are organising (he surely will?) the incident has damaged Mr Hague by making him look weak as a leader - something he has fought fiercely to avoid with his tough guy talk.</p> <p>Did Labour orchestrate Lord Taylor\u0092s public dither? The peer was vague about it yesterday. Many MPs said Yes. It had the hallmark of a Millbank or Downing St job. The timing - and the choice of language - point that way too.</p> <p>A bit of a phoney controversy to have dominated the media for five days, even by the phoney war standards of the postponed pre-campaign. There will be plenty more of this sort of stuff over the next six weeks.</p> <p><b>Ask Aristotle</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/person/0,,-5222.html\">John Townend MP</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/conservatives/\">Conservative party</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/racism/\">Race issues in the Uk</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/comment/\">More comment</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/conservatives/story/0,9061,480805,00.html\">30.04.2001: Race row Tory apologises</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/conservatives/story/0,9061,480805,00.html\">30.04.2001: Norris speaks out</a><br> <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/conservatives/story/0,9061,480583,00.html\">30.04.2001: Ultimatum for Hague in race row</a></p>",

Heath thought otherwise and sacked Powell even as the Powellite surge swept through suburb and factory alike. Many thought he would regret it and be replaced by the mesmerising prophet of racial disharmony and unreconstructed British identity. They were wrong: against odds as grim as Mr Hague faces on June 7 Heath beat Labour\u0092s Harold Wilson in 1970. Powell had to wait until 1974 when he played the Europe card with greater success before he could gleefully hum a Te Deum as the Tories lost. But he lost too and never held office again. Mr Townend is a Powellite, but not a Powell. He never rose higher than chairman of the rightwing backbench pressure group, the 92 group. But for the timing of his remarks and - until he was told to shut up on Sunday - his persistence - his views might have retired quietly with him. So why did Mr Hague not swat him aside immediately ? After all, he took the Tory whip away from another MP poised to leave the Commons, Charles Wardle, on the (disputed) grounds that the MP had threatened to back an independent Tory candidate in Bexhill and Battle. The contrast was a painful one and doomed Mr Hague\u0092s defence of his inaction in the weeks since Mr Townend\u0092s. What was good enough for Mr Wardle (actually it was an injustice) was surely good enough for Mr Townend! No one at Westminster seriously regards the Tory leader as a racist. He is the wrong age, class and educational profile. From the start he made clear that he did not agree with Mr Townend\u0092s tone or content. It is possible, but only just, to claim that his hesitation was prompted by decent instincts, by a broad church tolerance, a desire not to make a mountain out of an ancient East Yorkshire molehill. But it is also possible to argue that party HQ hoped to exploit the ambiguity inherent in Mr Hague\u0092s very public dither. The moderates would be assuaged by his evident distaste for the Bridlington wine merchant\u0092s language, the not-so-covert racists pleased by loud tabloid defence of the MP. Thanks to the awkward Wardle precedent it was never likely to work and rendered Mr Hague\u0092s hopes of peeling minority votes off Labour pretty minimal. The moment Lord Taylor started to cause trouble the prospect collapsed to less than zero. He dare not lose a black barrister , pin-striped suits and all, to Labour. By comparison Shaun Woodward\u0092s defection would have looked a plus with hindsight. In the event the Tories gained nothing in the polls, contrary to what some party officials had hoped. Nor has the asylum controversy done them much good. It will be harder to play it in a loose way now. Attacks on New Labour must be focused on the competence - or lack - of its vetting and admission policies. Whether or not Lord Taylor signs up to the letter of support from minority candidates which Hague aides are organising (he surely will?) the incident has damaged Mr Hague by making him look weak as a leader - something he has fought fiercely to avoid with his tough guy talk. Did Labour orchestrate Lord Taylor\u0092s public dither? The peer was vague about it yesterday. Many MPs said Yes. It had the hallmark of a Millbank or Downing St job. The timing - and the choice of language - point that way too. A bit of a phoney controversy to have dominated the media for five days, even by the phoney war standards of the postponed pre-campaign. There will be plenty more of this sort of stuff over the next six weeks.

Accordingly, I withdraw the recent words which I have issued on the subject of race, apologise for the embarrassment which they have caused the Conservative Party, regret any offence which I have caused to others and undertake not to repeat them under any circumstances. Statement in full from William Hague: In politics, issues blow up unexpectedly, but they do give you a chance to say who you are as a party. I want to say two things today: We mean business about being an inclusive party that has no truck with racism, and we mean business about being a disciplined party determined to win the election. Britain is made up of many ethnic communities. Conservatives believe that we are richer and stronger for it. I want people from all communities to feel at home in the Conservative Party, which means that racism can never be at home in the Conservative Party. I will not be driven by Labour's politically correct agenda that does not want to address their chaotic asylum policies, but nor will I allow John Townend's offensive remarks to be mistaken for those of the Conservative Party. Today I spoke to John Townend and told him that unless he was prepared to apologise for his ill-chosen words, withdraw them, undertake not to repeat them and accept that racism has no place in the Conservative party, then he could not remain a member of the Conservative party. He has today signed a statement to that effect. So we mean business about being an inclusive party that has no truck with racism. But we also mean business about being a disciplined party determined to win the election. And I cannot allow people in receipt of the Conservative whip in the House of Lords to agonise publicly about whether they support the party. A number of highly talented prospective parliamentary candidates and Members of the European Parliament from ethnic minority communities are today writing an open letter calling on people of all communities to support the Conservative party in the forthcoming election. Lord Taylor is being asked to add his name to this letter and I hope that he will be able to do so.",

The clampdown came only 24 hours after it seemed that Lord Taylor, rather than Mr Townend, would be disciplined. Following a coruscating attack on Friday on Mr Hague's \"misguided advisers\", and the racism within the party, Lord Taylor received an email ordering him to report to Lord Henley, the Conservative chief whip in the Lords, today. The email told him to stop attacking Mr Hague and suggested that \"he should instead urge all black people to vote Tory\". Lord Taylor was later assured at the weekend that he would not be disciplined. However, the meeting will go ahead today. Mr Hague has been resisting pressure to withdraw the whip from Mr Townend, an influential Eurosceptic figure in the party, saying it would amount to \"gesture\" politics since Mr Townend will be standing down as an MP at the election. But this position was badly undermined by the sudden withdrawal of the whip three weeks ago from Charles Wardle, the Tory MP for Bexhill who is also retiring at the election. Mr Wardle insists that he was misquoted when it was reported that he might support an independent candidate in his constituency. A final warning before expulsion, rather than withdrawing the whip from Mr Townend, was a much more draconian measure, Central Office claimed. The MP will not be asked to withdraw or apologise for his remarks. Conservative officials admitted that Mr Hague had been infuriated that his goodwill multicultural visit to Yorkshire last Thursday had been over-shadowed by Mr Townend's press release complaining that Britain was turning into a mongrel race. The MP also claimed to have massive support inside the party, adding that his views on asylum were similar to Mr Hague's.

      "body": "<p><strong><a name=\"A\">Discrimination</a></strong><br> One major consequence of the almost complete reliance on fixed-term contracts for research is the scope for discrimination, either direct or indirect. In principle, direct discrimination during an appointment should not be possible, although procedures may not be so rigorous. For example, there is often scope for job specifications to be written to match the required individual.</p> <p>Sadly, prejudices still remain within higher education. Women researchers working in a shared office have been assumed by visitors to be secretarial staff for their male colleagues, especially when answering the phone.</p> <p>While fixed-term contracts are in such widespread use, there is very little that can be done about stopping this \"passive\" discrimination.</p> <p>Of course, you should check the obvious: ensure that you are on the appropriate pay scale and point, that you get considered for promotion, and that you have appropriate parity with all colleagues (with issues such as authorship).</p> <p>Many women also prefer to put off starting a family until they are in a more secure position. However, you should bear in mind that some people continue to work on successive contracts as CRS for 10-20 years or longer.</p> <p>CRS should have parity in maternity benefits with established staff. So ensure that you can take maternity leave. Unscrupulous managers may use the vulnerability of your fixed-term position to persuade you against taking the length of maternity leave you wish to. Ignorant managers may simply get it wrong. If you are denied access, or feel pressurised into comprising, then contact your union.</p> <p>To ensure that you are considered for future appointments, you should also state clearly, and early on, that you intend to return to work if that is what you want, as it may be assumed that this will not be the case. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"B\"> The Concordat: CRS career management </a></strong><br> The Concordat is an agreement made in 1997 concerning improvements to the working conditions, career structure and management for CRS. It is the result of discussions between the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals (CVCP), the Standing Conference of Principals (SCOP), the Committee of Scottish Higher Education Principals (COSHEP), the research councils, and the British Academy. Unions were not part of the agreement.</p> <p>The Research Careers Initiative (RCI) is the national committee set up to monitor the implementation of the Concordat. Its first report in 1998 contained about 30 recommendations that need to be followed through at a local level.</p> <p>The aims of the Concordat are rather restricted, starting from the principle that contract researchers will be on fixed-term contracts for a limited time, and that an established career in academia or, exclusively, academic research, is realistic only for a minority. Essentially it merely encourages institutions to manage CRS better.</p> <p>However, does it represent a small step in the right direction, since it recognises some of the problems of CRS. For example, it requires that institutions make provision for the full salary costs of named researchers, including scope for promotion.</p> <p>So you should find out what the Concordat is all about. Has your institution actively been implementing the Concordat and RCI recommendations? Has it appointed an RCI coordinator and who are they? National agreements are one thing - local implementation is another matter.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"C\">Help</a></strong><br> Do not assume that your personal development and role are only your problem, or just yours and your manager's. If you need to know how to go about something, keep asking for guidance. They are paying you, so they should use you effectively. Apply for internal funds for attending conferences and training activities. The worst thing that can happen is if they say no, but they will know you are keen.</p> <p>Ask for regular appraisals. These are important to fall back on to demonstrate that your performance was satisfactory throughout your contract in case it is ever questioned at a later date. You can also use them to discuss issues such as promotion with your manager.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"D\">Your future</a></strong><br> As a CRS member, the chances of getting a career in research are largely out of your control. Initially, you are reliant on grant holders and other more senior people to keep you employed. Then you become more dependent on your own skills for obtaining funding, but at no point do you really become any more secure. The longer you are employed in an institution, the more likely you are to be able to be successful in negotiating your own terms, including getting your name on papers, working part-time or other arrangements. There are several steps you can take to improve your prospects.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"E\">Understand your prospects</a></strong><br> Contract research itself does not really amount to a career - the closest you get will be a string of contracts, possibly in different institutions or groups, covering a number of years. In fact, the policies of some research councils are designed to actively discourage researchers from being employed in such a way, with the aim of making sure they leave academia unless they get a lecturing post. Meanwhile, universities will wish to keep you, so long as the funding is there. </p> <p>Make sure that the work you are going to do will be likely to result in the kinds of things that might provide you with future prospects of work: publications, conference appearances and relevant skills. If you want to move to a lecturing job, get some teaching experience.</p> <p>Unfortunately, doing contract research often does not necessarily increase your attractiveness as far as future employees outside academia are concerned.</p> <p>Raise the question of what is likely to happen to you at the end of your contract during your interview and at regular intervals throughout your contract. This way, you can keep track of any changes (for example to funding) that might affect your situation at the end of your contract.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"F\">Publish</a></strong><br> You cannot have a successful academic research career without publications, so you should aim to write lots of papers and get them published in high-quality journals or conferences. Ensure that you are at least co-author on the papers concerning your research. Try to find some way of doing a single-author paper, perhaps on some \"extra\" research. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"G\">Bring in research funding</a></strong><br> Regrettably, the opportunities for applying for research funds are not the same for contract staff as for tenured staff. CRS are often forbidden from submitting applications in their own right due to the rules of either the funding body or the institution. For example, the EPSRC forbids grant holders from paying their own salary out of grants, yet the ESRC allows it - make sure you know the rules of your funders.</p> <p>Most of the research councils operate fellowship schemes, although usually for only a very limited number of researchers, so start applying for these as soon as you can.</p> <p>Make absolutely certain that any research proposal you write - or collaborate in the writing of - will, at the very least, guarantee you employment on the project should the application be successful (it has been known for researchers to successfully raise funds only to find themselves unemployed). So ensure that you are a named researcher on the grant, and check that the requested salary will be sufficient to pay you.</p> <p>Even if you cannot submit your own proposals, you can at least try to do some of the spade work, digging out grant opportunities and learning how the systems work. Help your manager to write proposals to keep the cash flow coming and keep yourself in a job. It is never too early to start investigating this.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"H\">Keeping records</a></strong><br> It is worth keeping your own work diary, recording meetings, hours worked on particular activities, training, along with notes of your contribution to your research work. You never know when this might come in useful.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"I\">Networking</a></strong><br> The chances are that you will find your next contract by virtue of your own efforts. A key factor is your network of contacts. Use every opportunity you get (such as conferences, workshops, contacts with industry) to extend that network. Know your rights and responsibilities.</p> <p>Make yourself an indispensable insider if you can - look for ways to collaborate with others and ask about the big picture of where you fit in and what the likely future is. It is not always easy, especially for women, but make them feel bad about the prospect of losing you.</p> <p>Contact established names in your discipline, and (hopefully) impress them. It seems that academia depends more often on who you know than anything else. </p> <p>Don't forget the internet as a means of networking. Valuable international contacts can be gained from joining and contributing to email discussion lists in your research domain. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"J\">Training</a></strong><br> Be aware that contract research is probably not going to be your gateway to a long-term career in academia. Get the most out of it while you can, but try to make sure you are training yourself for a future job outside.</p> <p>Take every opportunity to get more training - not only training suitable for your current position, but also general skills that can help your career progression. You will be under a lot of pressure to concentrate on project work, but remember that your salary stops when the project finishes. If anyone tries to block you getting training, then contact your union.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"K\">Updating your CV</a></strong><br> Be constantly on the look-out for ways to enhance it, both for academic and outside credibility. Responsibilities, local involvement, teaching, computing skills, a strong contact network and work abroad can all help. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"L\">Promotion</a></strong><br> Like any other member of staff, CRS are eligible for promotion. In some cases, this is not taken into account early enough by project managers, and appropriately experienced CRS are taken on to projects where no allowance has been made to pay the extra cost of promotion. In the worst cases, CRS may even have to take pay cuts, work without receiving increments or have the project shortened because they were engaged to work on under-funded projects. This is particularly a danger when contracts are extended via follow-on projects.</p> <p>The Concordat even advises institutions and funders to build in costs of promotion where there is a possibility of requiring them during the lifetime of a grant. The promotion would then be made in accordance with the policies and procedures of the employing institution.</p> <p>So, if you consider that you will be eligible for promotion within a project then, before it starts, check that this will in principle be possible and has been budgeted for. When you determine that your responsibilities warrant promotion, you should get support from your project manager and apply to your institution in the usual way.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"M\">When to leave</a></strong><br> By keeping yourself informed about the prospects of continued funding on your project, you will hopefully be able to judge whether there is likely to be future employment for you. You should therefore look at alternatives months ahead of the end of your present contract. Keep your CV up to date and regularly send it to prospective employers (you may even discover a job you prefer).</p> <p>If you get an offer that you wish to accept, there is little point in staying to the bitter end of a contract that may not be renewed, especially if you are not entitled to redundancy pay. Dole gaps in your CV will do you no favours.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"N\">At the end of a contract</a></strong><br> The period around the end of each contract can be messy and very stressful. Redundancy itself can cause many practical, financial and psychological problems to you. However, you may also be kept in a state of uncertainty about your future, depending on the success of a research project announcement.</p> <p>If your contract is not going to be renewed, then your employer is required to follow a redundancy procedure in order to dismiss you fairly.</p> <p>\u0095 Is it really a redundancy? Can the redundancy be avoided by re-deployment elsewhere in the university? The redundancy should be far more pro-active than pointing you to the list of vacancies, and may involve retraining or utilising a bridging fund to cover short funding gaps.</p> <p>\u0095 Mitigation: Your prospects may be improved via training or by receiving career guidance. At the very least, the university should offer you continued use of facilities such as the library, internet and email. One concrete way of mitigating the effects of any redundancy is to offer redundancy pay.</p> <p>If the university does not invoke a suitable redundancy procedure (which would clearly need to start several months before the end of your contract) then, apart from adversely affecting your prospects, your dismissal could be unfair.</p> <p>And do not forget to provide your department with a forwarding address for post.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"O\">Contract extension</a></strong><br> In many cases, your contract may be extended or renewed when you start work on a new research project. Sometimes funding is only secured right at the last minute, perhaps even with a gap between projects.</p> <p>You should make sure that you have backup plans in place so that you have alternatives in case last-minute funding applications fail. However, you should know when to leave. You may be better off taking other employment opportunities, even if this means leaving the project before the end, rather than facing the uncertainty of funding applications.</p> <p>If there are gaps between projects, the university should provide bridging funding, so that disruption to your work is kept to a minimum instead of obliging you to consider unpaid work.</p> <p>When considering an extension, ensure that you will continue under the same terms and conditions as before. In particular, check that you will be placed on the same or higher point on the pay scale. If a project proposal has been made with you in mind, then appropriate allowance in salary should have been made to support you, in accordance with recommendations in the Concordat.</p> <p>As far as the university is concerned, you employment ends on the end date of your contract. Notwithstanding what any individual member of staff might say, any promised extension is pie in the sky until you get a new contract in your hand. Treat verbal promises made by individuals with great caution - they may mean little to the personnel department. As with your initial contract, you should have a written contract extension before this further period of work begins.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"P\">Web resources</a></strong><br> Two national email discussion groups are relevant to CRS.

      "bodyText": "The World Health Organisation has long been committed to a total ban on tobacco advertising. But by the end of this week its dream of a tobacco ad-free world may be in tatters. The anti-tobacco lobby has accused WHO of selling out to the tobacco industry and compromising its aims. In Geneva this week the first worldwide anti-tobacco treaty is being thrashed out by government representatives At preliminary meetings last October, 25 countries agreed to an outright ban on tobacco advertising. But the draft treaty, written by Brazilian diplomat Celso Amorim, takes a much softer line on advertising than was expected. It would commit governments to ban \"all forms of direct and indirect tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship targeted at persons under the age of 18\". This means advertising targeted at over-18s will still be acceptable. The advertising provisions were criticised as \"useless, unenforceable and misguided\" by the anti-tobacco pressure group, Action on Smoking and Health. ASH director Clive Bates said: \"We expect the US to oppose any serious advertising restrictions, we expect the EU to be weak on smuggling and we expect Japan to try and block consumer protection measures like a ban on misleading 'light' branding. \"By the time they've watered down the text to their liking there may not be much left.\" The treaty is scheduled to come in to force in 2003. According to the Institute of Development Studies, 4m people a year die from smoking, a figure that will rise to 10m a year by 2020. The report says efforts to control the resulting spread of smoking are undermined by the deluge of marketing, advertising and sponsorship. But the WHO treaty is the last in a long line of laws that have failed to implement a total tobacco advertising ban. Last year the European Union received a setback in its efforts to ban tobacco promotion by a European Court decision and has since adopted a more liberal approach. The UK's Tobacco Advertising &amp; Promotion Bill, a Labour manifesto pledge, is currently being debated in the Lords. It proposes a ban on tobacco advertising except at point of sale, but could still be diluted as tobacco companies push hard for exemptions for direct marketing. The tobacco industry is determined to continue retain the right to send smokers direct mail, an exercise it spends \u00a350m a year on in the UK. Useful link ASH website",

      "body": "<p>There is no conduct quite so unbecoming as the betrayal of a friend. Israel professes to be a friend of Europe and yet, in its dealings with Europe, Israel has cheated and lied and abused the trust that was placed in its officials. It has done this cynically and systematically - and has been found out. The question now is what Europe is going to do about it.</p> <p>In 1995 Israel and Europe signed an agreement \"to establish lasting relations, based on reciprocity and partnership\". On the first page, both sides declared a commitment to \"the common values that they share\" and \"the observance of human rights and democracy\".</p> <p>Among other things, Europe promised Israel cooperation in a wide range of fields, including culture and science - an important morale-booster for any country which has been ostracised by its neighbours.</p> <p>But the biggest prize for Israel was trade: it would be allowed to export its own goods to Europe either duty-free or at reduced rates. Today, that trade accounts for one third of Israel's worldwide exports.</p> <p>This was not merely a goodwill gesture by Europe. The agreement (and another one signed later with the Palestinians) was meant to reward Israel for its participation in the Oslo peace process, and to encourage further progress in the negotiations. Indeed, several European countries waited for signs of further progress before ratifying the agreement.</p> <p>The agreement was based (misguidedly, as it turned out) on mutual trust. This meant that Israeli customs officials were expected to certify - truthfully - that the goods exported to Europe had in fact been produced in Israel.</p> <p>But no sooner had the ink dried on Shimon Peres's signature than Israel began to cheat. To imagine that this was due to a few bent officials in the customs department would be a mistake: cheating was built into the system and it was carried out with the blessing of the Israeli government.</p> <p>The cheating took three forms, which I outlined in an article last week (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,477171,00.html\">Europe colludes in Israeli trade scams</a>). One was to re-label produce from other countries as Israeli.</p> <p>Another was to pretend that products from illegal Israeli settlements had originated within Israel's internationally-recognised boundaries. The third was to frustrate the Palestinians' efforts to trade directly with Europe and instead force them to send their produce via Israel under an Israeli label. Because of this, money which by rights should have gone to Palestinians went to Israelis and, in the case of imports, the Palestinian Authority was deprived of much-needed tax revenue.</p> <p>In 1997, as a result of complaints, the European commission sent a delegation to Israel to find out why Brazilian orange juice arriving in Europe had been certified as Israeli in order to qualify for preferential rates.</p> <p>The problem, the delegation concluded, went way beyond orange juice: Israeli customs officials simply could not be trusted. The problem was so serious, their report said, that \"the validity of ALL preferential certificates issued by Israel, for ALL products\", was in doubt.</p> <p>The commission then issued a warning to European companies which trade with Israel, pointing out that they could be liable to backdated import duties if the certificates proved to be invalid.</p> <p>In the meantime, the commission announced it would take steps to verify the \"ample evidence\" of Israeli violations of the agreement, and added that \"should these violations ... be confirmed they should be brought to an end.\" Instead, they continued. Last year, after months of hesitation, the process of returning suspect certificates to Israel for verification finally got under way.</p> <p>Britain has so far returned certificates for Ahava cosmetics, dates, carpets from Barkan (a West Bank settlement), wines, brandy and liqueurs, pencils, plastic household items, key blanks and locks, electrical items, and bath and skincare products. The commission has also alerted British customs to watch out for biscuits and Soda Stream drinks makers. Other countries have taken similar action, but the products have continued to enter Europe at preferential rates.</p> <p>The procedure laid down in the agreement for challenging the validity of certificates is to seek verification, though nobody is in any real doubt that the products have come from illegal settlements and that their documentation has been falsified. They are listed as settlement products on rival Israeli websites which urge people either to boycott them or to make a point of buying them.</p> <p>Under the rules, once Europe asks for verification, Israel is allowed 10 months to provide evidence of the real origin of a product. The deadline on some products has already expired; on others it will expire between now and the end of September. So far as is known, Israel has not replied.</p> <p>In the absence of confirmatory evidence from Israel within the 10-month deadline, customs authorities throughout Europe can refuse preferential treatment for the product concerned, and claim backdated duties at the full rate.</p> <p>Israel, in turn, is obliged under the agreement to take punitive action against anyone who has been involved in falsifying documents. In the coming weeks, European leaders will decide whether to continue with this leisurely, piecemeal approach or whether to take tougher action.</p> <p>Ending preferential treatment for settlement products would certainly be progress, but it barely scratches the surface. It does not address the European commission's most serious complaint: that all certificates issued by Israel, for all products, are suspect.</p> <p>To re-establish trust, Israel will have carry out a thorough overhaul of the way it does business with Europe. On past form, that is unlikely to happen unless Europe threatens to terminate the agreement.</p> <p>Given that Israel has shown such persistent bad faith - in contrast to the spirit of \"reciprocity and partnership\" on which the agreement is based - there are reasonable grounds for termination.</p> <p>The unfair practices employed against Palestinian trade with Europe are further evidence of Israel's lack of commitment to a genuine partnership.</p> <p>Finally, one might ask whether the agreement has served its aim of promoting peace. By helping to keep the settlements in business it may well have prolonged the conflict. And while the peace process is on hold, might it not make sense to put the Euro-Israeli agreement on hold too?</p> <p>France has already said it wants tough action. But any decision would have to be unanimous - and Britain and Germany are resisting.

      "bodyText": "There is no conduct quite so unbecoming as the betrayal of a friend. Israel professes to be a friend of Europe and yet, in its dealings with Europe, Israel has cheated and lied and abused the trust that was placed in its officials. It has done this cynically and systematically - and has been found out. The question now is what Europe is going to do about it. In 1995 Israel and Europe signed an agreement \"to establish lasting relations, based on reciprocity and partnership\". On the first page, both sides declared a commitment to \"the common values that they share\" and \"the observance of human rights and democracy\". Among other things, Europe promised Israel cooperation in a wide range of fields, including culture and science - an important morale-booster for any country which has been ostracised by its neighbours. But the biggest prize for Israel was trade: it would be allowed to export its own goods to Europe either duty-free or at reduced rates. Today, that trade accounts for one third of Israel's worldwide exports. This was not merely a goodwill gesture by Europe. The agreement (and another one signed later with the Palestinians) was meant to reward Israel for its participation in the Oslo peace process, and to encourage further progress in the negotiations. Indeed, several European countries waited for signs of further progress before ratifying the agreement. The agreement was based (misguidedly, as it turned out) on mutual trust. This meant that Israeli customs officials were expected to certify - truthfully - that the goods exported to Europe had in fact been produced in Israel. But no sooner had the ink dried on Shimon Peres's signature than Israel began to cheat. To imagine that this was due to a few bent officials in the customs department would be a mistake: cheating was built into the system and it was carried out with the blessing of the Israeli government. The cheating took three forms, which I outlined in an article last week (Europe colludes in Israeli trade scams). One was to re-label produce from other countries as Israeli. Another was to pretend that products from illegal Israeli settlements had originated within Israel's internationally-recognised boundaries. The third was to frustrate the Palestinians' efforts to trade directly with Europe and instead force them to send their produce via Israel under an Israeli label. Because of this, money which by rights should have gone to Palestinians went to Israelis and, in the case of imports, the Palestinian Authority was deprived of much-needed tax revenue. In 1997, as a result of complaints, the European commission sent a delegation to Israel to find out why Brazilian orange juice arriving in Europe had been certified as Israeli in order to qualify for preferential rates. The problem, the delegation concluded, went way beyond orange juice: Israeli customs officials simply could not be trusted. The problem was so serious, their report said, that \"the validity of ALL preferential certificates issued by Israel, for ALL products\", was in doubt. The commission then issued a warning to European companies which trade with Israel, pointing out that they could be liable to backdated import duties if the certificates proved to be invalid. In the meantime, the commission announced it would take steps to verify the \"ample evidence\" of Israeli violations of the agreement, and added that \"should these violations ... be confirmed they should be brought to an end.\" Instead, they continued. Last year, after months of hesitation, the process of returning suspect certificates to Israel for verification finally got under way. Britain has so far returned certificates for Ahava cosmetics, dates, carpets from Barkan (a West Bank settlement), wines, brandy and liqueurs, pencils, plastic household items, key blanks and locks, electrical items, and bath and skincare products. The commission has also alerted British customs to watch out for biscuits and Soda Stream drinks makers. Other countries have taken similar action, but the products have continued to enter Europe at preferential rates. The procedure laid down in the agreement for challenging the validity of certificates is to seek verification, though nobody is in any real doubt that the products have come from illegal settlements and that their documentation has been falsified. They are listed as settlement products on rival Israeli websites which urge people either to boycott them or to make a point of buying them. Under the rules, once Europe asks for verification, Israel is allowed 10 months to provide evidence of the real origin of a product. The deadline on some products has already expired; on others it will expire between now and the end of September. So far as is known, Israel has not replied. In the absence of confirmatory evidence from Israel within the 10-month deadline, customs authorities throughout Europe can refuse preferential treatment for the product concerned, and claim backdated duties at the full rate. Israel, in turn, is obliged under the agreement to take punitive action against anyone who has been involved in falsifying documents. In the coming weeks, European leaders will decide whether to continue with this leisurely, piecemeal approach or whether to take tougher action. Ending preferential treatment for settlement products would certainly be progress, but it barely scratches the surface. It does not address the European commission's most serious complaint: that all certificates issued by Israel, for all products, are suspect. To re-establish trust, Israel will have carry out a thorough overhaul of the way it does business with Europe. On past form, that is unlikely to happen unless Europe threatens to terminate the agreement. Given that Israel has shown such persistent bad faith - in contrast to the spirit of \"reciprocity and partnership\" on which the agreement is based - there are reasonable grounds for termination. The unfair practices employed against Palestinian trade with Europe are further evidence of Israel's lack of commitment to a genuine partnership. Finally, one might ask whether the agreement has served its aim of promoting peace. By helping to keep the settlements in business it may well have prolonged the conflict. And while the peace process is on hold, might it not make sense to put the Euro-Israeli agreement on hold too? France has already said it wants tough action. But any decision would have to be unanimous - and Britain and Germany are resisting. Last January, Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, was asked in a letter if he would consider suspending the agreement on the grounds that Israel had infringed a clause dealing with human rights. In response, Mr Cook pointed out another clause that says: \"Nothing in this agreement shall prevent a party from taking any measures...which it considers essential to its own security\". Mr Cook, who used to pride himself on Britain's \"ethical\" foreign policy, commented: \"Any EU moves towards suspension of the agreement on human rights grounds would involve lengthy and difficult negotiations with Israel on the relative weight to be attached to these two articles. These negotiations would leave little room for anything else in the EU-Israel relationship.\" So perhaps Ariel Sharon need not worry after all.

The UK anti-tobacco pressure group, Action on Smoking and Health, said the convention was in the pocket of the tobacco industry and had sold out to vested interests. US President Bush's administration has strong links with the industry and the Japanese government owns Japan Tobacco International.

      "byline": "Alan Williams",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong><a name=\"A\">Introduction</a></strong><br> Most research in universities is carried out by contract research staff (CRS), who are on fixed-term contracts and often funded by external research contracts, where each contract is directly linked to a particular piece of funding for a specific research project.</p> <p>This guide is aimed at those who are considering contract research and those who have just started as CRS. It gives tips from other contract researchers indicating what you should think about before deciding to do contract research, how to get the most out of it, and how to avoid some of the problems caused by the nature of contract research. </p> <p>You will find that, in some items below, there is a lot of detail. You may not necessarily wish to take all of it into account in the excitement of looking for and getting a new job. However, this will be a good resource once you are there. </p> <p>Of course, no guide will ever be a substitute for getting detailed personal advice on your particular situation from your union - the CRS experience varies enormously, even within the same department, and it is therefore impossible to cover all circumstances.</p> <p>However, it is important to emphasise that, despite all of these problems, academic research is often extremely rewarding. It is a great opportunity to pursue something which you are passionately interested in, offering a lot of flexibility, working with supportive colleagues in a stimulating environment, with the chance to make world-shattering discoveries \u00dc at the cutting edge of knowledge.</p> <p>On the other hand, the very use of fixed-term contracts is often the cause of many of the difficulties highlighted below. Higher education unions argue that they are also extremely inefficient and do not enable institutions and researchers to pursue their work in the most productive way.</p> <p>For example, the Association of University Teachers (AUT) is campaigning against the casualisation of academic staff and for the vast majority to be employed on a long-term basis.</p> <p>You may agree with this (and wish to participate in union campaigns against casualisation), but here we will only look at getting the most out of the current situation, one where almost all researchers in universities are employed on fixed-term contracts. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"B\">Doing your own research</a></strong><br> There are a lot of advantages to being a member of CRS. Hours are generally more flexible than in many jobs (but you need to check) and, in the right research group, you can enjoy your work. You may also be somewhat more protected in terms of the teaching and administration that you can be required to undertake (but you will need to find out what your position would actually be).</p> <p>Find out what being CRS really involves and understand what you would be getting into \u00dc make use of national CRS networks or look at research into CRS issues (for example Colin Bryson's research) Do you actually want to do it? Does it fit in with your career plans? One reason CRS run into trouble is because they are not clear what they may be expected to do. </p> <p>\u0095 The research group: If you decide CRS is for you, then go and meet the people that you would be working with, or who are in the same unit/department. Is it friendly and does it provide a good working atmosphere, or is it likely that you will be working in a small room isolated from everyone else? Will you have your own office or laboratory space? Will appropriate equipment be available and supported (or will you end up as the lab technician?).</p> <p>\u0095 The institution: This is a bit wider than the immediate research group but just as important \u00dc after all, the institution is your employer. Not all institutions treat CRS in the same way. Find out if it has a code of practice for employing CRS, to implement the Concordat. This should cover project management, maternity leave/pay (check carefully any qualification conditions), and provision for support at the end of a project, including bridging and redundancy.</p> <p>Will you get redundancy pay and does the institution operate a meaningful redeployment scheme? Do CRS have parity with established lecturing staff with respect to their terms and conditions? Will you be treated as a member of staff (as you should be), or essentially as a student? Do you have equal access to the library (you should do)? Are relocation expenses paid (they should be)?</p> <p>Will the institution charge you fees if you wish to take a further degree? Then check if the code is actually implemented. The two important principles are that it is the university that is your employer (not the research funder or your project manager) and that you are a full member of staff (rather than a glorified student).</p> <p>\u0095 The research funder: Contract research is paid for from a variety of sources, including the government-funded research councils, various charities, the European Union and commercial enterprises.</p> <p>All have their own interests and requirements. You should check what the particular rules attached to your funding would be - will they restrict you? For example, will you be able to spend a proportion of your time on work not directly related to the project (training, teaching, your own research)?</p> <p>Are there any restrictions on publication or ownership of the work? Is the funder committed for the full duration of the project or is there a possibility they will stop the funding, perhaps because they are not satisfied with interim results? Does the funder allow CRS to apply for research grants in their own name?</p> <p>As part of their mission, the main research councils are required to provide trained researchers. As well as funding postgraduate students, some interpret this as requiring a continuous flow of CRS, and so their policies are designed to discourage CRS from staying in universities for more than a couple of contracts.</p> <p>By arming yourself with this information before you begin, you will go a long way to saving yourself from some nasty surprises or disappointments later on. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"C\">Joining a union</a></strong><br> Fixed-term contracts themselves are the cause of many of the problems described here. Contract researchers are more vulnerable than any other staff group to being unfairly treated/dismissed, and missing out on legal entitlements.</p> <p>You may find it difficult to stand up for yourself unless you know that your situation is wrong and that there are people to support you. Reliable information and advice may not be available. You will not have a very loud voice on your own. </p> <p>It is therefore essential that you join a union. You may not want to get actively involved, but think of it as insurance. Only a union can help effectively if anything bad happens to you, but like any insurance it can only help if you have been a member for some time prior to a crisis.</p> <p>You may see your current job as a short-term thing that will end soon anyway, so why bother joining? But there may be problems within your first contract.

      "bodyText": "Introduction Most research in universities is carried out by contract research staff (CRS), who are on fixed-term contracts and often funded by external research contracts, where each contract is directly linked to a particular piece of funding for a specific research project. This guide is aimed at those who are considering contract research and those who have just started as CRS. It gives tips from other contract researchers indicating what you should think about before deciding to do contract research, how to get the most out of it, and how to avoid some of the problems caused by the nature of contract research. You will find that, in some items below, there is a lot of detail. You may not necessarily wish to take all of it into account in the excitement of looking for and getting a new job. However, this will be a good resource once you are there. Of course, no guide will ever be a substitute for getting detailed personal advice on your particular situation from your union - the CRS experience varies enormously, even within the same department, and it is therefore impossible to cover all circumstances. However, it is important to emphasise that, despite all of these problems, academic research is often extremely rewarding. It is a great opportunity to pursue something which you are passionately interested in, offering a lot of flexibility, working with supportive colleagues in a stimulating environment, with the chance to make world-shattering discoveries \u00dc at the cutting edge of knowledge. On the other hand, the very use of fixed-term contracts is often the cause of many of the difficulties highlighted below. Higher education unions argue that they are also extremely inefficient and do not enable institutions and researchers to pursue their work in the most productive way. For example, the Association of University Teachers (AUT) is campaigning against the casualisation of academic staff and for the vast majority to be employed on a long-term basis. You may agree with this (and wish to participate in union campaigns against casualisation), but here we will only look at getting the most out of the current situation, one where almost all researchers in universities are employed on fixed-term contracts. Doing your own research There are a lot of advantages to being a member of CRS. Hours are generally more flexible than in many jobs (but you need to check) and, in the right research group, you can enjoy your work. You may also be somewhat more protected in terms of the teaching and administration that you can be required to undertake (but you will need to find out what your position would actually be). Find out what being CRS really involves and understand what you would be getting into \u00dc make use of national CRS networks or look at research into CRS issues (for example Colin Bryson's research) Do you actually want to do it? Does it fit in with your career plans? One reason CRS run into trouble is because they are not clear what they may be expected to do. \u0095 The research group: If you decide CRS is for you, then go and meet the people that you would be working with, or who are in the same unit/department. Is it friendly and does it provide a good working atmosphere, or is it likely that you will be working in a small room isolated from everyone else? Will you have your own office or laboratory space? Will appropriate equipment be available and supported (or will you end up as the lab technician?). \u0095 The institution: This is a bit wider than the immediate research group but just as important \u00dc after all, the institution is your employer. Not all institutions treat CRS in the same way. Find out if it has a code of practice for employing CRS, to implement the Concordat. This should cover project management, maternity leave/pay (check carefully any qualification conditions), and provision for support at the end of a project, including bridging and redundancy. Will you get redundancy pay and does the institution operate a meaningful redeployment scheme? Do CRS have parity with established lecturing staff with respect to their terms and conditions? Will you be treated as a member of staff (as you should be), or essentially as a student? Do you have equal access to the library (you should do)? Are relocation expenses paid (they should be)? Will the institution charge you fees if you wish to take a further degree? Then check if the code is actually implemented. The two important principles are that it is the university that is your employer (not the research funder or your project manager) and that you are a full member of staff (rather than a glorified student). \u0095 The research funder: Contract research is paid for from a variety of sources, including the government-funded research councils, various charities, the European Union and commercial enterprises. All have their own interests and requirements. You should check what the particular rules attached to your funding would be - will they restrict you? For example, will you be able to spend a proportion of your time on work not directly related to the project (training, teaching, your own research)? Are there any restrictions on publication or ownership of the work? Is the funder committed for the full duration of the project or is there a possibility they will stop the funding, perhaps because they are not satisfied with interim results? Does the funder allow CRS to apply for research grants in their own name? As part of their mission, the main research councils are required to provide trained researchers. As well as funding postgraduate students, some interpret this as requiring a continuous flow of CRS, and so their policies are designed to discourage CRS from staying in universities for more than a couple of contracts. By arming yourself with this information before you begin, you will go a long way to saving yourself from some nasty surprises or disappointments later on. Joining a union Fixed-term contracts themselves are the cause of many of the problems described here. Contract researchers are more vulnerable than any other staff group to being unfairly treated/dismissed, and missing out on legal entitlements. You may find it difficult to stand up for yourself unless you know that your situation is wrong and that there are people to support you. Reliable information and advice may not be available. You will not have a very loud voice on your own. It is therefore essential that you join a union. You may not want to get actively involved, but think of it as insurance. Only a union can help effectively if anything bad happens to you, but like any insurance it can only help if you have been a member for some time prior to a crisis. You may see your current job as a short-term thing that will end soon anyway, so why bother joining? But there may be problems within your first contract. This may well be extended, sometimes several times, so unless you join at the start there is a danger you will be without insurance for a long time. Also, only the unions can have any hope of influencing your pay and conditions, and then only if they're seen to represent enough of you. You may also wish to become active in the union in order to fight against casualisation and the second-class academic citizenship of CRS. The Association of University Teachers (AUT) has a CRS committee which initiates and co-ordinates campaigns, responds to national developments and liaises between CRS members and national AUT. The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) represents academic staff (more in post-1992 universities) and is also committed to reducing casualisation. The Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union (MSF) opposes short-term contracts amongst scientific workers and promotes greater participation by women in science, engineering and technology. Understanding your position Before accepting a job you should find out specifically what will be expected of you. Will you be required to undertake any teaching, supervision or administration? Again, if you know about this beforehand, you can take appropriate action if you are not happy. Do not let managers offload inappropriate tasks onto you, such as arbitrary teaching or administrative duties - any teaching should have been agreed with you at the start and, in general, would be related to your research. You are there to do research - and a little teaching if that's what you want - so do not get distracted. This is particularly true if your post is being funded by a research council or a commercial enterprise that has asked for a particular piece of work. Questions will be asked if the work is not completed (and you may get the blame, even if it's not your fault). However, check that you will have the opportunity for personal development via training, or even having some proportion of your time so that you can pursue your own non-project research. If you are sharing your time between more than one project, or if you are to be employed part time, check that it is clear how much time you will be expected to allocate to a particular project. There is always the danger that the sum of the parts will be greater than the whole. It is useful to see the proposal for the project that you are working on. This will probably lay down quite clearly what is expected of you. Hours One of the perceived benefits of academic research is that you have very flexible hours and are free to work when you wish (as long as you get the job done). Many contracts do not specify hours, saying you will be expected to work \"reasonable hours\". However, you should check if there are times when you will be expected or required to work \u00ca for example, will you be required to work weekends? If there are, you may be happy to accept them (if they are reasonable), but at least it will be far easier to walk away or to negotiate if you are not happy. It is one thing voluntarily working certain hours, but may well be a problem for you if you have to do it. Also check that your department's position on working from home fits in with your own wishes, working style and circumstances. Some departments forbid working from home, whereas other departments are happy for employees to work from home on a regular basis. Authorship When you accept, but before the project starts, get a written agreement from your project team members about authorship of papers: \u0095 Under what circumstances will someone appear as an author? \u0095 How will the order of authors be determined? That way, the principles are laid down and you know where you stand. Although different disciplines have their own conventions, in general, if you contribute directly (by writing) or indirectly (for example, by producing results) to a paper, then you should be included as an author. A related and particular thorny topic concerns the inclusion in the author list of one's manager/project supervisor, even if they have made little or any contribution. Understanding your contract rights You should be issued with a written contract before you begin work. Read it carefully before you accept and make sure that you understand what it is saying (seek advice from your union if you are not certain). If it refers to other documents, get hold of them and make sure you know what they say. \u0095 Duration: The contract should normally last as long as the project - check that there are no probationary periods or other reviews that you did not expect. \u0095 Conditions: Check that these match what you had been informed - it is not reasonable for the contract to introduce conditions you were not already aware of. Again, ask advice from your union if you are unsure before you sign. Equally, you should question anything that you think is missing - it is dangerous to rely on verbal agreements. \u0095 Watch your pay: Get hold of the local pay scales and descriptions of the grading levels.

Also, try to find out what your colleagues are earning, especially if you are a woman or a member of an ethnic minority. You could be a victim of unjustified, systematic, thoughtless discrimination. Employment rights Find out what your employment rights are so that you will be in a position to determine whether they are being honoured. They cover important things such as maternity, pension, sick leave, pay scales, redundancy/dismissal, holiday, hours, or disability. If you will be working part-time, ensure that you have the same (pro-rata) conditions as your full-time colleagues. The area is far too big to list in detail, but clearly, your union will be able to assist you. Your CRS colleagues will also be able to help, both within your institution and outside.

      "bodyText": "The US media giant, AOL Time Warner, has chosen cable operator NTL as a partner in its bid to boost European revenues. The world's largest media company is seeking a broadband distribution deal across the Atlantic and has made NTL its main target. NTL, which dominates the cable market in the UK and Ireland with 8m subscribers, today stressed the talks were in their early stages. \"We are talking to a broad range of companies about a range of agreements,\" said an NTL spokesperson. \"While it is true that we are in the early stages of talks with AOL, apart from an outline terms sheet nothing has been agreed.\" While AOL Time Warner has an extensive cable network in the US, it lacks a similar operation in Europe, and needs a broadband deal to get the most from its TV, music, film and internet services. The surprise move follows a dramatic week for NTL, in which it raised an extra \u00a3388m in financing but was tipped to run out of money by the end of June by the HSBC investment bank. Despite its pre-eminent position in the UK market, the company's \u00a310bn debt burden remain a source of concern for investors, who want to see a more tangible return from its \"triple play\" offer, in which telecoms, internet and TV services are bundled into one package. NTL insiders have privately scorned the HSBC report, saying its capital expenditure will fall from \u00a31.9bn to \u00a31bn by next year. But AOL Timer Warner is expected to team up with other European cable services, as NTL only has 500,000 subscribers outside the UK and Ireland. Steve Case, the chairman of the \u00a372bn media group, last month said the company will raise its international revenues from 17% to 50% of the total over the next 10 years.",

It confirmed at the weekend that the Army's Whitburn training camp near Sunderland supplied waste food to the Northumberland pig farm at the centre of the foot and mouth outbreak. But it said all food provided by caterers at the camp conformed to British and European rules that ban imports from areas hit by the disease. What's going on?

As if the reign of William and Mary was just William, or the jokes of Morecambe and Wise were entirely Wise? </p> <p>Isn't this exactly the spin which suggests that only a hospital consultant can make you get better, or that a single, partisan MP really is a loving mother or father to all 50,000 voters in their constituency? Isn't it one of the tightest brakes on a real, participative democracy which taps the resources to be found in everyone?</p> <p>Rather grand conclusions to draw from the exclusion from gongs of a few, well-paid media folk, maybe. But from such small injustices, much bigger flaws really do arise. </p> <p>One of the problems of the BBC in recent years has been the sidelining and second-guessing of producers, whose views have been dismissed by either the budget brigade or the wodge of new commissioning editors beamed in from Planet Birt.</p> <p>And it works the other way. Although modesty is becoming, it is famously dangerous when influential people develop a liking for working behind the scenes or in the dark. How do we react to names like Machiavelli and Metternich (or more prosaically, Ingham and Campbell)? That's right: boo hiss.</p> <p>Which is why the Sony speech broadcaster judging panel this year has decided to do something about it. Chaired by Caroline Millington, former BBC controller of radio, a plea has been entered for a speech broadcast producer award in 2002. </p> <p>The letter containing the request to the Radio Academy underlines the enormous input of producers, and the way that so many outstanding programmes have rested on their hidden shoulders. And goodness, isn't that producer-shaped, ghostly space even more embarrassing when there are already awards for interactive programmes, short-form radio and the digital terrestrial station of the year?</p> <p>With 29 categories already, they may need to lay on an extra course and even more drinks at the Grosvenor House ceremony in 2002, to give the producers their due. But they would also be striking a small blow for the unacknowledged everywhere, who could do with a golden bauble to bang on the negotiating table.</p> <p><strong>Email</strong><br><a href=\"MAILTO:martin.wainwright@theguardian.com\">martin.wainwright@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.radioacademy.org/\">Radio Academy</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/\">BBC Radio</a><br><a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.co.uk/\">Radio Times</a></p>",

Isn't this exactly the spin which suggests that only a hospital consultant can make you get better, or that a single, partisan MP really is a loving mother or father to all 50,000 voters in their constituency? Isn't it one of the tightest brakes on a real, participative democracy which taps the resources to be found in everyone? Rather grand conclusions to draw from the exclusion from gongs of a few, well-paid media folk, maybe. But from such small injustices, much bigger flaws really do arise. One of the problems of the BBC in recent years has been the sidelining and second-guessing of producers, whose views have been dismissed by either the budget brigade or the wodge of new commissioning editors beamed in from Planet Birt. And it works the other way. Although modesty is becoming, it is famously dangerous when influential people develop a liking for working behind the scenes or in the dark. How do we react to names like Machiavelli and Metternich (or more prosaically, Ingham and Campbell)? That's right: boo hiss. Which is why the Sony speech broadcaster judging panel this year has decided to do something about it. Chaired by Caroline Millington, former BBC controller of radio, a plea has been entered for a speech broadcast producer award in 2002. The letter containing the request to the Radio Academy underlines the enormous input of producers, and the way that so many outstanding programmes have rested on their hidden shoulders. And goodness, isn't that producer-shaped, ghostly space even more embarrassing when there are already awards for interactive programmes, short-form radio and the digital terrestrial station of the year? With 29 categories already, they may need to lay on an extra course and even more drinks at the Grosvenor House ceremony in 2002, to give the producers their due. But they would also be striking a small blow for the unacknowledged everywhere, who could do with a golden bauble to bang on the negotiating table.

Research published today by the Broadcasting Standards Commission shows the public believes celebrities should accept that all aspects of their lives may be made public.

Politicians were a little more controversial, with older \"traditional\" people feeling their lives should be subject to the same degree of scrutiny as celebrities, but younger \"modern\" groups believing their private lives should be kept private. But respondents said private citizens should have an absolute right to privacy unless they chose to waive their rights. The report, Reflecting Community Values: Public Attitudes to Broadcasting Regulation, was based on a series of focus groups. It included questions about the rights of people volunteering to be in fly-on-the-wall documentaries, which showed most respondents believing they also had forfeited their rights to privacy. All focus group respondents felt, however, that \"private citizens\" had an absolute right to privacy. But nearly 30% of respondents felt that by choosing to appear on television, members of the public had forfeit that right. The report revealed that older respondents were more inclined to feel that the private lives of individuals should be kept private, even when there was a public interest justification. More than half of the over-55s questioned felt there was never a public interest justification for intrusion into private lives.

      "bodyText": "Jerry Springer, the king of trash television, is to be the face of Channel 5's election coverage. Executives at the station say they will approach the prime minister, Tony Blair, and the leaders of the two other main parties asking for face-to-face interviews with controversial chat show host. Mr Springer, who has made millions out of the outrageous confessions of his guests, has been lined up to present a series of shows for Channel 5. He will fly over to London this weekend and for the Bank Holiday weekend at the end of May to film a British version of his US chat show and a documentary about the election \"from an outsider's point of view\". But Channel 5 bosses are determined to get him in the studio with the party leaders and are optimistic the prime minister will be sympathetic to their request. Four years ago Tony Blair agreed to a similar appearance with the station's former news star, Kirsty Young. \"This will be really big box office for us,\" said a Channel 5 spokesman. \"Jerry Springer in combat with Tony Blair and William Hague would be a much bigger crowd puller than the Dimblebys or even Jeremy Paxman.\" Springer's special relationship with the broadcaster has surprised many, particularly since the station's budget cannot accommodate the huge fees US stars command. However, the Chicago-based presenter is the perfect match for Channel 5 because it will allow him to indulge in what he knows best - controversy. \"He felt he was on a leash at ITV and he wants to be more outrageous,\" said Alan Nixon, the head of entertainment at Channel 5. Mr Springer, who was born in Hampstead in London, had decided he would spend six months of the year in the UK even though it will mean a punishing schedule involving three days a week in Chicago and four days a week in London. Among the shows lined up for him include Greed, a \u00a31m prize gameshow. One fanciful idea dreamed up by TV executives is a celebrity version of his chat show featuring live confrontations between warring couples such as Patsy Kensit and Liam Gallagher.

Until the law changed, the commission, and other lottery boards, was unable to solicit bids. It was also unable to give any lottery money to organisa tions to help them draw up the time-consuming and detailed proposals required to satisfy the funding criteria. Details of the prime minister's initiative came to light in a confidential memorandum sent to Mr Blair by Chris Smith, the culture secretary, last April. The memo sought Mr Blair's approval for special measures because,it said: \"It has proved more difficult to support capital projects addressing ethnic minorities. \"Despite many government initiatives, the Afro-Caribbean community still faces significant deprivation and social exclusion which the lottery could, and should, do something to address. Particularly important would be some landmark projects to which these and other communities could look as a beacon of black aspiration and achievements.\" Mr Smith went on to say that both he, as chairman of the millennium commission, and Mo Mowlam, the Cabinet Office minister who sits on the body, believed the commission was \"uniquely well placed\" to use the positive discrimination powers to help black groups. Mike O'Connor, the commission's director, confirmed that, following Mr Smith's plea to the prime minister, the go-ahead had been given for the initiative, which has now attracted applications totalling almost double the amount of money available. He said: \"Because we have put our head above the parapet in funding ethnic minority groups, I expect we will face criticism since we won't able to grant all the applications.\" Related story Cash in the community",

      "body": "<p>Two years ago, having just given birth to my first child at 5am, an unexpected acceleration in labour meant that I missed out on the epidural I wanted, and I was feeling pretty sore about it in more ways than one. But uppermost in my mind, with my newborn and husband crashed out asleep together in the armchair, was a craving for a cup of tea and a bacon sandwich. </p> <p>Sadly, at that hour, no one was taking orders for a fry-up. If asked for a personal recommendation on how to modernise maternity services, \"bacon and anaesthetists\" would have been my reply. </p> <p>Bacon aside, the care from staff at Pontefract hospital was excellent. According to an audit commission survey a few years ago, most women say that they are pleased with the care they receive. The trouble is that there are wide variations in maternity services across the country. These limit rather than extend the choices offered to women and their partners at a critical time in their lives. </p> <p>Perhaps most important of all, those variations often reflect deep-rooted inequalities. The founding principles of the NHS are that healthcare should be free at the point of use, based on need, not ability to pay. That means ensuring that those in greatest need do not have least access to health services. Nowhere is this more important than at the very beginning of a child's life. </p> <p>So as part of a plan to tackle child poverty and give every child the best start, Alan Milburn, the health secretary, will set out this week a major programme of modernisation in our maternity services. That means investment in facilities and recruitment, improvements to screening and the beginnings of a major scheme of national standards in maternity and children's health. We need such new standards to ensure proper safety and high-quality care in every area. </p> <p>Now in the sixth month of my second pregnancy, I know from personal experience that different places can have very different approaches. The consequence of travelling each week between Westminster and my constituency is signing up for maternity care at both ends of the country. After all, it's hard to predict where I will be when labour starts. All mothers know that drawing up birth plans can prove pointless when labour takes a different course. Discussing epidurals with two sets of midwives proved doubly redundant but provided an interesting insight into the variations that exist. </p> <p>Different units offer different tests at different points in pregnancy. In fact if you switch hospitals at the right point, you can probably clock up six different tests for Down's syndrome (scans, double and triple tests galore) and each will give you a slightly different result. </p> <p>One of the first areas in which we are introducing national standards involves the screening and counselling support to be offered for certain tests in pregnancy and newborns so that parents have a proper, informed choice about which tests they want. Work is under way too on clinical standards around the management of labour, particularly when problems arise, including induction, fetal monitoring and Caesareans. </p> <p>Second, as investment in the NHS grows, we need to address the backlog in underinvestment that can have a huge impact on family experience. Staff are often working extremely hard, but having to contend with outdated, rundown facilities. Some units offer home-from-home comforts, perhaps with separate midwife-led facilities. Others have cramped labour wards that look more like Victorian operating theatres. </p> <p>In Pontefract there were TVs in individual rooms on the labour ward, in theory to provide distraction during a long labour. In practice I suspect they found more enthusiasm among partners, bored with helping with breathing. Either way, modern maternity services need modern facilities too. </p> <p>Increasing staffing levels is vital. Recruitment pressures in some areas make it difficult to provide the one-to-one care in established labour that women want. The Pontefract area operates team midwifery, which meant we saw the same familiar faces before, during and after the birth. In other areas hard-working health service staff have developed different innovative models to provide continuity of care and support. In part it means proper staffing, but it can also mean new ways of working. </p> <p>As new investment and improvements take place it is essential that they support choices for parents. The choice whether to have a home birth varies dramatically across the country. Personally I am too risk-averse, and pain-averse, to dream of a home birth myself. The idea of all that trauma in my kitchen or bedroom is enough to put me off ever going into the rooms again. But wherever it is clinically appropriate, these are choices the NHS should, where possible, support. </p> <p>So mothers and mothers-to-be will be asked their views on improving maternity services across the country. And for the first time in any government review of this kind, we will explicitly seek the views of fathers too. Already the royal colleges representing midwives, obstetricians, paediatricians and anaesthetists have joined the government and parent groups in a joint maternity working group. </p> <p>But in the end, the real challenge is to improve the choices and support avail able for those whose voices are least often heard, yet who may need support most. As one midwife told me, the expectant mothers she worried about most were often least likely to make it to appointments. </p> <p>Certainly for those on low incomes facing a long bus ride with toddlers in tow, a trip to an antenatal appointment can be a daunting experience. As my own second bump gets bigger and bulkier, wrestling with an errant pushchair, an excitable toddler and the London-to-Yorkshire train each week is ordeal enough. It is only a matter of time before we sail past our Wakefield stop because a coincidence of tantrums and twinges make it physically impossible to get everything off in time. </p> <p>So improving access to maternity services is not just about what happens in hospital, or the care the NHS provides. Already Sure Start programmes are providing toddler-friendly mini-buses to healthcare appointments, or taking the midwives out into family homes. After the baby is born, extending care and support is just as vital - whether it be help for women who want to breastfeed, identifying post-natal depression or just making sure that there is someone to talk to in those difficult early months. </p> <p>It isn't hard to be passionate about improving maternity services and children's health when your own little one is on the way. But if we are to deliver major improvements in children's health across the board, we need to build on progress in all these areas. Only that way can we ensure that every child gets the very best start in life. </p> <p><strong>The author is public health minister and MP for Pontefract and Castleford. </strong></p>",

Instead, Jo offered me the chance to become financially independent in a few years. I had been spammed. </p> <p>Call it inertia, but I've grown used to arriving home to listen, on my answer-machine, to time-share salesmen offering me a trip to Disney. I also quickly delete those emails offering an \"Aaamazingly huge\" opportunity, or the ones from African businessmen asking for the use of my bank account for a guaranteed fee. </p> <p>Most people learn to live with the junk which fills their email and voicemail boxes every day. Even though I was annoyed at being duped by Jo, I couldn't be bothered enough to take a note of his or her Altavista email account or send a stinging message back. That could change, however, if the egregious Jo found my cell-phone number. </p> <p>Cell-phones in the US - or at least in the connection desert that is New York city - have many drawbacks. One of these is that users are charged when they are called as well as when they do the calling. </p> <p>This actually makes it illegal for someone to send unsolicited commercial email, or spam, to a mobile phone in the US under a provision in the Telephone Consumer Protection Act designed to save consumers money. However, a very murky legal area means that there is no prohibition on sending a short text message to the same device. And almost all of the cell-phones sold in the US are provided with a text-messaging capacity. Consumers only pay when they respond to a message on most services. </p> <p>Armed only with telephone numbers and the name of the local provider - both easy to find out - spammers can send out one message that will beep simultaneously on thousands of mobile devices. Bad news if all the owners are at the same tennis match. </p> <p>Rodney Joffe was at a performance of Riverdance when he received what he took to be an urgent message. The Arizona-based entrepreneur had remembered to turn off his telephone function but not his text messaging service. When it rang during the show, he jumped in embarrassment. After reading his message, however, he thought the caller must have dialled a wrong number. It read: \"To Carla - mortgage rates cut - still interested?\" </p> <p>But when the same company called his cell-phone a month or so later, using a different message, Joffe realised that he had been spammed. Unlike most of us, Joffe, the former chief technology officer of an internet access company, did something about it. </p> <p>After turning to the web, he found more than 170,000 people who, he claims, have all been targeted by the same company, a local mortgage provider. Joffe has now launched what is believed to be the first lawsuit against a company for wireless spam in the US. </p> <p>Privacy advocates in the US, who have long battled against some of the weakest legislation in the world, believe that consumer outrage against wireless spam could prove to be the last straw. They also hope that an early response could stop a fledgling industry in its tracks. \"It's really important to make a stand early on,\" says Joffe. \"By the time we realised what was going on with email spam it was too late.\" </p> <p>He faces an uphill struggle, largely because advertisers have only just started to wake up to the potential for short-text messaging in the US. In an interview with National Public Radio, Gerald Youhanaie, the president of the mortgage company that targeted Joffe, was completely unabashed by the protest. He called text-messaging \"a unique medium to inform people that mortgage rates were on the decline\". Then he added: \"We felt it was very cost-effective.\" </p> <p>A wireless advertising company called SkyGo says the potential market for commercial email over wireless phones is so huge that few companies will ignore it. The company paid 1,000 people to take part in a four-month trial of spammed phones and, perhaps unsurprisingly, reported back that they were happy to receive the messages. The study did find that consumers preferred to choose when to see the ads, however. </p> <p>Jason Catlett, the president of Junkbusters.com, a privacy campaign group, hopes that the growing furore over relatively rare wireless spam could help prompt tighter legislation against wired and telephone spam. He appeared before the US Congress last week and argued that a proposed bill that would allow consumers to opt out of receiving spam needs to be made far tougher. </p> <p>Until there is more political support for his position, however, I'm keeping my cell-phone number to myself.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Someone called Jo Eardmore sent me an email labelled \"interesting\" the other day. I don't know Jo, but he or she could have been a contact or someone who was, indeed, interesting. Instead, Jo offered me the chance to become financially independent in a few years. I had been spammed. Call it inertia, but I've grown used to arriving home to listen, on my answer-machine, to time-share salesmen offering me a trip to Disney. I also quickly delete those emails offering an \"Aaamazingly huge\" opportunity, or the ones from African businessmen asking for the use of my bank account for a guaranteed fee. Most people learn to live with the junk which fills their email and voicemail boxes every day. Even though I was annoyed at being duped by Jo, I couldn't be bothered enough to take a note of his or her Altavista email account or send a stinging message back. That could change, however, if the egregious Jo found my cell-phone number. Cell-phones in the US - or at least in the connection desert that is New York city - have many drawbacks. One of these is that users are charged when they are called as well as when they do the calling. This actually makes it illegal for someone to send unsolicited commercial email, or spam, to a mobile phone in the US under a provision in the Telephone Consumer Protection Act designed to save consumers money. However, a very murky legal area means that there is no prohibition on sending a short text message to the same device. And almost all of the cell-phones sold in the US are provided with a text-messaging capacity. Consumers only pay when they respond to a message on most services. Armed only with telephone numbers and the name of the local provider - both easy to find out - spammers can send out one message that will beep simultaneously on thousands of mobile devices. Bad news if all the owners are at the same tennis match. Rodney Joffe was at a performance of Riverdance when he received what he took to be an urgent message. The Arizona-based entrepreneur had remembered to turn off his telephone function but not his text messaging service. When it rang during the show, he jumped in embarrassment. After reading his message, however, he thought the caller must have dialled a wrong number. It read: \"To Carla - mortgage rates cut - still interested?\" But when the same company called his cell-phone a month or so later, using a different message, Joffe realised that he had been spammed. Unlike most of us, Joffe, the former chief technology officer of an internet access company, did something about it. After turning to the web, he found more than 170,000 people who, he claims, have all been targeted by the same company, a local mortgage provider. Joffe has now launched what is believed to be the first lawsuit against a company for wireless spam in the US. Privacy advocates in the US, who have long battled against some of the weakest legislation in the world, believe that consumer outrage against wireless spam could prove to be the last straw. They also hope that an early response could stop a fledgling industry in its tracks. \"It's really important to make a stand early on,\" says Joffe. \"By the time we realised what was going on with email spam it was too late.\" He faces an uphill struggle, largely because advertisers have only just started to wake up to the potential for short-text messaging in the US. In an interview with National Public Radio, Gerald Youhanaie, the president of the mortgage company that targeted Joffe, was completely unabashed by the protest. He called text-messaging \"a unique medium to inform people that mortgage rates were on the decline\". Then he added: \"We felt it was very cost-effective.\" A wireless advertising company called SkyGo says the potential market for commercial email over wireless phones is so huge that few companies will ignore it. The company paid 1,000 people to take part in a four-month trial of spammed phones and, perhaps unsurprisingly, reported back that they were happy to receive the messages. The study did find that consumers preferred to choose when to see the ads, however. Jason Catlett, the president of Junkbusters.com, a privacy campaign group, hopes that the growing furore over relatively rare wireless spam could help prompt tighter legislation against wired and telephone spam. He appeared before the US Congress last week and argued that a proposed bill that would allow consumers to opt out of receiving spam needs to be made far tougher. Until there is more political support for his position, however, I'm keeping my cell-phone number to myself.",

      "body": "<p>It's been a long time coming and it's still not quite all there, but so far it's got a tentative thumbs up from an industry not ordinarily noted for eulogies. itv.com looks like finally happening this year as part of ITV's effort to get its house in order. A rumoured investment of \u00a315m in a website for the ITV network makes perfect sense, and puts to shame other media companies that are getting twitchy about the internet. Top 10 status shouldn't be that difficult to achieve, and, with ITV's sales clout, it might actually make some of that elusive internet cash. </p> <p>At this stage, plans are still very sketchy. Everyone is waiting for new ITV boss Stuart Prebble to sit down and thrash out the company's internet strategy with ITV henchmen and the heads of interactive departments at Carlton and Granada, the dominant ITV shareholders. While it may not be Prebble's top priority, itv.com is still important. </p> <p>Senior executives at Granada Broadband and Carlton Interactive are expecting a summons from ITV network centre in Grays Inn Road this week to determine itv.com's structure, and define how the centralised operation should be run. </p> <p>So far it seems that itv.com will make very little difference to their operations, despite a leaked memo from Gerry Murphy, the chief executive of Carlton, suggesting that downsizing may occur. But, says Justin Judd, controller of online at Granada Broadband, it's not a matter of merging internet operations, it's more about pooling resources. \"We'll still look after all our own resources, such as Wellbeing, SwapitShop and the Liverpool and Arsenal websites, but our content will now be pulled into a much bigger portal.\" </p> <p>Likewise, Carlton will hold onto its internet assets, which include Jamba, Popcorn, Taste and Carlton.com, and feed them into itv.com. Production and development will still be handled by Carlton and Granada's individual teams, while a new \"leaner and meaner commissioning body\" will sit in network centre, pulling it all together. </p> <p>Some preparations are going on behind the scenes: no surprise as the idea for itv.com has been touted since before Carlton chairman Michael Green first revealed it in June last year. One snag, however, was always ownership of the domain name itv.com. It was owned by one Nick Rosen of the Online Research Agency, who registered it in 1994 thinking it would make a good name for an interactive TV (iTV) website. After lengthy negotiations, Rosen caved in and sold it for a reported \u00a3100,000 at the beginning of April - just in time for ITV to start singing and dancing about ITV Digital. </p> <p>What is important about the proposals for itv.com is that finally the two former adversaries have seemingly buried the hatchet and have laid to rest the ridiculous notion of trying to plug their own corporate brands as entertainment portals. What Carlton was trying to achieve with Carlton.com has baffled many internet pundits - Carlton is a brand that means absolutely nothing to that part of the population not served by its TV franchise. </p> <p>That said, Carlton did at least make an effort early in the web game. It developed three strong specialist websites which gave the impression it had a good web strategy, until it seemed to stall 18 months ago. Success wasn't just born out of luck, though. Carlton brought in Carol Dukes, one of the internet's cleverest operators, who quickly pulled together some of the best talent in the industry. She is now founding CEO of Thinknatural.com. </p> <p>Granada, on the other hand, took a long time getting to where it is now. Its big internet adventure so far has been G-Wizz, an expensive drain on resources (around \u00a39m was spent) which taught execs that internet branding was not about having a snazzy name. With G-Wizz finally exterminated, Granada has been able to get back to focusing on what it's good at: content. Having brought in two former Granada TV producers (Judd and Simon Shaps) last year, it has had to work out just what it can do with its programmes on the web. </p> <p>Since joining Granada Broadband, Judd has been working on a number of programme sites and initiatives, namely the Popstars website, chat and SMS strands, and redefining flagship brands such as Coronation Street, This Morning and Emmerdale. In addition, Granada Broadband has invested in the cross-media Wellbeing venture with Boots and kids exchange site Swapitshop. They will all now be rolled into itv.com along with Carlton's web properties. </p> <p>To move forward, itv.com needs a managing director and the sooner the better, according to John Hardie, ITV's marketing and commercial director, who wants to see the project accelerate ahead. \"The MD could be found internally or externally - there's no shortage of people around with the right experience. Once we get the right group of people together and find the right person to run it, it's full steam ahead.\" </p> <p>It's going to be quite a challenge. While unquestionably it will be a big, well-paid and high-profile job, that person will have to be skilled in the art of tricky negotiations. Even if everything at ITV now looks rosy, there is a certain amount of baggage that might make it frustrating at times. </p> <p>The history of Carlton and Granada fighting their own corners at the network is well-documented, which is why the companies' internet strategies have never been comfortable bedfellows. In a perverse way, their inertia has worked in their favour in that they haven't (aside from G-Wizz) rushed in and wasted tons of cash on foolish ideas. </p> <p>Conrad Roeber, a partner at Spectrum Strategy Consultants, thinks itv.com should be trying to punch at an even higher weight, not just settle for top 10 status. \"They wouldn't accept that position for their TV channel,\" he says. Roeber suggests itv.com should look even further afield than just entertainment, and start thinking about their respective 20% stakes in ITN. </p> <p>\"They haven't yet been able to incorporate ITN.co.uk within the proposed portal, which is a pity, given the importance of online news to the BBC,\" says Roeber. \"Clearly, this is due to the independence of ITN from the ITV shareholders, but it would make perfect sense for these two to form a strategic alliance in the online environment, and it is a pity that this has not been identified as one of ITV's ambitions.\" </p> <p>The network's ambitions for itv.com have also so far failed to include two smaller cogs in the ITV machine - Scottish Media Group and Ulster, who between them own the remaining 8% of the network. Including these assets in itv.com would bring Virginradio.co.uk, a ready-made network of classified sites, and an Irish internet service provider from Ulster TV, to the table. The sum of the parts has enormous potential, and should start to make competitors such as Sky.com, BBC.co.uk and Channel4.com reassess their tactics. </p> <p>Andy Anson, head of strategic planning at Channel 4, is concerned that if itv.com works then it could be \"quite scary\" for other players such as himself. \"Even if they are late to market, they have a fantastic opportunity in having a powerful brand like ITV on the web, and have some fantastic assets. With the right shows and the right format, it will work - it just has to be marketed effectively.\" </p> <p>In terms of content, itv.com will be very strong. Having recently started to beef up itv.co.uk, ITV already has a foretaste of what it can achieve. Take Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? for example; from barely more than a URL in the end credits of the show, the online quiz has attracted 45m page impressions and 310,000 registered users since its launch three weeks ago. </p> <p>ITV also has a few other websites to add to the pile, namely itv-f1.com, itv-football.com and itv-rugby.com, and it is now readying its site for a British version of the US hit Survivor. Other inclusions in the site could be AskJeeves.co.uk, a venture owned by Carlton and Granada; and possibly repurposed content from ONNet, marked for rebranding as ITVNet. </p> <p>Hardie wants itv.com to be \"a focused entertainment website\" reflecting ITV's mantra: the best place for entertainment in the UK. It will have TV clips, perhaps even an internet soap, games, sport, celebrity chats, audio, text messaging services, chat rooms, and the ubiquitous TV listings information. </p> <p>Why have they hung back so long? \"We've hung back so long that we've been able to look at other people's mistakes and crystallise our own vision,\" says Hardie. \"We don't want an electronic magazine support website, we want to give people the most fun they can have online.\" </p> <p>If all goes to plan, the first version of the site should be up and running within five months. And then what happens? Global expansion of the ITV brand? Internet pay-per-view? Who's to say? It's one step at a time, cautions Hardie.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair has sanctioned the preferential allocation of millions of pounds to ethnic minority projects bidding for lottery funds. The money will go towards a programme to end the social exclusion and deprivation of black communities. </p> <p>The groups likely to benefit from the switch in policy include an arts and music centre named after the late campaigning Labour MP Bernie Grant; a training centre for black architects named after the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence; and a family project in one of the most deprived inner city areas in Leicester, in the constituency of Keith Vaz, the Foreign Office minister. The successful bids will be announced in the next two months. </p> <p>The prime minister approved switching \u00a320m of lottery money from the Lottery's New Opportunities Fund to the millennium commission, in order to fund big projects led by black and Asian groups.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has sanctioned the preferential allocation of millions of pounds to ethnic minority projects bidding for lottery funds. The money will go towards a programme to end the social exclusion and deprivation of black communities. The groups likely to benefit from the switch in policy include an arts and music centre named after the late campaigning Labour MP Bernie Grant; a training centre for black architects named after the murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence; and a family project in one of the most deprived inner city areas in Leicester, in the constituency of Keith Vaz, the Foreign Office minister. The successful bids will be announced in the next two months. The prime minister approved switching \u00a320m of lottery money from the Lottery's New Opportunities Fund to the millennium commission, in order to fund big projects led by black and Asian groups. The move followed a Whitehall analysis which showed that only 2.3% of lottery money went to ethnic minority groups, although these groups make up 6% of the population. Ministers have also invoked, for the first time, \"positive discrimination\" clauses in the 1998 Lottery Act, allowing the millennium commission to solicit applications from black projects, and to give them \u00a3623,000 of lottery funds with which to draw up their bids. Until the law changed, the commission, and other lottery boards, was unable to solicit bids. It was also unable to give any lottery money to organisa tions to help them draw up the time-consuming and detailed proposals required to satisfy the funding criteria. Details of the prime minister's initiative came to light in a confidential memorandum sent to Mr Blair by Chris Smith, the culture secretary, last April. The memo sought Mr Blair's approval for special measures because,it said: \"It has proved more difficult to support capital projects addressing ethnic minorities. \"Despite many government initiatives, the Afro-Caribbean community still faces significant deprivation and social exclusion which the lottery could, and should, do something to address. Particularly important would be some landmark projects to which these and other communities could look as a beacon of black aspiration and achievements.\" Mr Smith went on to say that both he, as chairman of the millennium commission, and Mo Mowlam, the Cabinet Office minister who sits on the body, believed the commission was \"uniquely well placed\" to use the positive discrimination powers to help black groups. Mike O'Connor, the commission's director, confirmed that, following Mr Smith's plea to the prime minister, the go-ahead had been given for the initiative, which has now attracted applications totalling almost double the amount of money available. He said: \"Because we have put our head above the parapet in funding ethnic minority groups, I expect we will face criticism since we won't able to grant all the applications.\"",

Last year alone, more than 50 were killed across the globe and Colvin could so easily have added to the grim statistics recorded by the World Association of Newspapers (WAN). </p> <p>She was, as she is the first to admit, lucky. Lucky to have survived so many conflicts. Lucky not to have died at the hands of Sri Lankan troops two weeks ago. Lucky to be able to fly away from so many countries which deny indigenous journalists the freedom to report. </p> <p>Many of the people on WAN's list were murdered by enemies within their own countries, with Colombia and Russia having by far the worst body count. Colvin's case is somewhat different. She runs toward the sound of gunfire, putting her life on the line time after time in order, as she says with such sincerity it sounds nothing like a sanctimonious boast, \"to bear witness.\" </p> <p>Her trip to the Tamil enclave in the north of Sri Lanka in defiance of a government ban on visits by journalists was a classic example of her work. She aimed to speak to the Tamil Tigers' leadership to assess their political stance in the light of Norwegian-sponsored peace negotiations. But she also wanted to report on the humanitarian crisis in an area where 500,000 people - \"civilians, all of them\", she stresses - are living in cities turned to rubble, where aid agencies are barred from offering help, food and fuel are scarce and medicine is non-existent. It is a tribute to the Sunday Times, and a measure of its confidence in Colvin, that its editor John Witherow and foreign editor Sean Ryan backed her desire to go. </p> <p>The conflict between the Singhalese and Tamils, in which 63,000 people have died since 1983, is one of the most under-reported of wars. No foreign reporter has managed to enter Tamil-held territory since the blockade began in 1995. </p> <p>That Colvin got in was a testament to her determination and fitness: she walked 30 miles through jungle with her Tamil guides to slip past government lines. Ten days later, while trying to do the reverse journey, she ran into a government unit and, in the melee, got separated from the Tamil escort as she crawled into undergrowth. </p> <p>\"I was terrified,\" she admits, \"more frightened than I've ever been before. This was a take-no-prisoners army. When I realised I was hit I didn't have any profound thoughts. I just kept thinking it was taking me an awfully long time to die.\" She then stood up and shouted \"journalist, journalist\", quickly realising that the troops she was facing were also \"scared, hysterical and hyped-up\". </p> <p>Bleeding from injuries caused by grenade shrapnel to her left eye and chest, she was roughed up during her interrogation before receiving medical help, eventually reaching hospital in Colombo. From there, she was flown to New York via London, where her former husband, Daily Telegraph foreign correspondent Patrick Bishop, jumped aboard. </p> <p>He was at her bedside when doctors confirmed what she had learned in Colombo: since the shrapnel entered the centre of her left eye, she will almost certainly be left, at best, with only peripheral vision. \"I won't be blind-sided. It's not so bad,\" she says almost casually from the comfort of her mother's house in Long Island. </p> <p>Colvin was born and raised in New York, and studied marine biology at Yale before switching to major in English literature while working on the university's paper and becoming hooked on journalism. </p> <p>After a year on a trade paper, she was hired by the international news agency UPI, working in New York and Washington before heading up the Paris bureau - \"a grand name for a one-woman band\", she recalls - which included covering the Middle East. While there, she acted as a stringer for the Sunday Times and in 1986, when the paper lost its renowned middle east correspondent David Blundy to the Sunday Telegraph, Colvin took his job. She acknowledges the black irony that a couple of years later Blundy was killed by crossfire in San Salvador. </p> <p>Colvin made a success of that post, reporting well from Libya - where she got to know Colonel Gadafy, though not as well as he would have liked - and from the Lebanon. It was her reporting from Beirut which led her inevitably down the path of becoming a war correspondent. </p> <p>Since then she has covered conflicts in the Balkans, Chechnya and, memorably, East Timor, where she famously helped to save the lives of 1,500 women and children besieged in a compound by Indonesian troops. She refused to leave them, waving goodbye to 22 journalist colleagues to stay on with an unarmed UN force and help highlight their plight by reporting to the world, in her paper and on global TV. The publicity was rewarded when they were evacuated to safety after four tense days. </p> <p>This is the essence of Colvin's approach to reporting. She isn't interested in the politics, the strategy, the weaponry, only the effects on the people she regards as innocents. \"These are people who have no voice,\" she says. \"I feel I have a moral responsibility towards them, that it would be cowardly to ignore them. If journalists have a chance to save their lives, they should do so.\" </p> <p>People, clearly, have not forgotten Colvin's courage. At the end of her Sunday Times report about her Sri Lankan experience, she wrote: \"What I want most, as soon as I get out of hospital, is a vodka martini and a cigarette.\" Later that week, having moved briefly to New York's St Regis hotel, she was woken by a room service waiter bearing a tray with a huge bottle of vodka and all the necessary ingredients for her drink of choice. She says: \"It had been fixed, God knows how, by the East Timor crowd, the people in the compound.\" </p> <p>It is the only moment I detect any emotion in Colvin's voice. After a moment she tells me that although she has stared death in the face it won't stop her returning to the front line if the occasion demands. </p> <p>That's why Thursday, World Press Freedom Day, is so important. It reminds us that journalism, proper journalism, Colvin's journalism, is still worth fighting for, even in a country where celebrity trivia dominates too many news pages. </p>",

Sally Leaney voices her concerns about the government's plan to shift the emphasis for farmers away from the role of \"food producer\" and towards \"keeper of the countryside\". She claims the strategy is unrealistic.</p> <p><strong> The Wall Street Journal Europe </strong><br> The paper investigates the related issue of mad cow disease. A front page story reports on a patents row that has broken out following the discovery of a \"breakthrough\" in identifying the disease.</p> <p><strong> The Sun </strong><br> The paper counters the Mirror's Phoenix the calf PR victory. The Sun supplies cake and champagne to the owners of Porky, the 18-stone Vietnamese pot-bellied pig that was saved from the slaughterhouse the 11th hour.

This, combined with the Tory race row, Nelson Mandela's appearance in Trafalgar Square and the expected confession from Martin McGuiness of his role in Bloody Sunday, pushed foot and mouth off the front pages of all the national papers. The Independent The paper continues its investigations into the source of the virus. It carries the first interview with a Maff vet, who voices his belief the disease was present in sheep before it broke out officially at a pig farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall in Northumberland. The Daily Telegraph The Telegraph continues to claim to be the voice of the countryside, focusing on the impact of the crisis on country people by publishing the diary of a farmer's wife. Sally Leaney voices her concerns about the government's plan to shift the emphasis for farmers away from the role of \"food producer\" and towards \"keeper of the countryside\". She claims the strategy is unrealistic. The Wall Street Journal Europe The paper investigates the related issue of mad cow disease. A front page story reports on a patents row that has broken out following the discovery of a \"breakthrough\" in identifying the disease. The Sun The paper counters the Mirror's Phoenix the calf PR victory. The Sun supplies cake and champagne to the owners of Porky, the 18-stone Vietnamese pot-bellied pig that was saved from the slaughterhouse the 11th hour. Surprisingly, all the tabloids missed a golden opportunity to use a picture of the former \"sex bomb\", Brigitte Bardot, whose actions were instrumental in saving Porky.

      "body": "<p>Just before Christmas 1999, Andrew and Janette Findlay and their two children, Stacey, 13, and Daryl, 11, were killed when their new bungalow in Larkhall, Lanarkshire, was blown to pieces by a huge gas explosion.</p> <p>The metal gas main near their house had corroded, causing a leak. A spark from a light being switched on or the boiler starting probably caused the blast.</p> <p>When engineers dug up the pipe they reportedly found 19 holes in it. The old system of \"trigger surveys\", to check on mains after snaps of cold weather, had been abandoned by Transco, the privatised monopoly responsible for the gas pipe network. New safety procedures, approved by the health and safety executive (HSE), had been introduced instead.</p> <p>A Transco employee has also said that the company did not have proper records. Engineers called to the area thought new plastic mains had been laid when in fact the old ductile iron mains which suffer from corrosion and can fail suddenly were still in place.</p> <p>In October last year there were more angry relatives and neighbours demanding answers. An elderly couple, William and Mary Bailey, died from burns after a gas explosion ripped through their home in Dundee. Transco had been called to the area four times in the previous 18 months to investigate suspected leaks.</p> <p>In September the HSE passed a report on its Larkhall investigation to the Crown Office, which is expected to decide shortly whether charges should be brought against Transco for culpable homicide or criminal negligence. If it decides not to prosecute there will be a fatal accident inquiry.</p> <p>In Scotland, Larkhall and Dundee are known as the gas industry's Hatfield. South of the border the full implications have yet to sink in. But with other parallels with Railtrack emerging, alarm bells are ringing. Transco says it has fulfilledits safety obligations. It has been considered a well run company, but the question that won't go away is: how do you ensure the safety of an essential service when the owner of the assets is a privatised monopoly with a duty to maximise profits?</p> <p>The much-hyped privatisation of the British Gas Corporation took place in 1986, and was an early Thatcher triumph, with thousands of people rushing to buy shares. In 1996 Britain became the first country in the world to deregulate its energy market when it began to open up the supply of gas to competition.</p> <p>Offshore producers take gas, mostly from the North sea, and land it around the coast. More than 50 shippers and suppliers now compete to sell it to domestic and commercial customers.</p> <p>In 1997 British Gas was split up. A new company, Centrica, now handles accounts and billing, although it still trades under the name British Gas. BG plc was left with offshore exploration and Transco, the privatised monopoly which operates and maintains the pipe network transporting gas from the coast to the meter, and runs the 24 hour gas emergency service.</p> <p>Last year Transco was hived off into the Lattice group. The Lattice group has been under pressure, with share prices falling, and has built up huge debts trying to move into telecoms. Transco's debt book is the largest of any British utility after BT.</p> <p>Transco is restructuring again, splitting its assets (the pipes) from its operations (maintenance and emergency work). These will be further divided into up to 20 units and could be sold off. Industry insiders fear this will \"create another Railtrack\".</p> <p>Deregulation was meant to cut gas bills and, at first sight, five years on it has. Although only 6m out of 20m customers have changed their suppliers, British Gas estimates domestic users have seen their total bills reduced by around \u00a31bn a year.</p> <p>The figures suggest a business success too. British Gas profits in 1985 immediately before privatisation were \u00a3712m, and soared to \u00a31.06bn in 1987. Transco, whose transportation costs account for 40% of domestic gas bills, reported an operating profit pre-deregulation in 1995 of \u00a3780m, and a post-deregulation peak in 1998 of \u00a31.22bn.</p> <p>The picture this year is more troubling. As a privatised monopoly Transco is regulated by Ofgem (the office of gas and electricity markets), which sets price controls. But Ofgem cannot make Transco invest, and Transco underspent on capital expenditure by 23% in 1997 and by 19% in 1998. Now Transco has said it will need to increase spending on mains replacement work by more than 50% over the next three years. To do so it wants to set higher prices.</p> <p>Ofgem has seen its role as a driver of competition. In theory greater competition forces down prices while giving incentives to maintain standards. But utility experts fear there is an inherent conflict. The danger is that if prices are set a company could increase shareholder value only by outwitting the regulator on its costs or spending less later. Only now, five years after deregulation, is Ofgem proposing to introduce medium and long term performance reports to check trends on leakage, pipework replacement and forecasts on future capacity.</p> <p>As with other utilities, the constant hiving off of companies enables the group to realise shareholder value. Bits of the company that are most profitable can be sold off. Foreign utility giants would be keen to get their hands on the assets. They can get a guaranteed return, and if they chose not to invest but just to fix problems then sell on in time, who is to catch up with them?</p> <p>The constant restructuring presents particular difficulties to the safety regulator, the HSE. A spokesman said: \"Every time I blink, something seems to have changed its logo, but whatever happens somebody somewhere will end up with the responsibilities that used to be Transco's.\"</p> <p>Transco has pleaded for a different approach. \"Economic regulation has been dominant,\" it says in submissions to Ofgem. \"Structural changes to promote competition have been encouraged, so far with little consideration of the potential trade-offs against operational integrity and safety. In future a different view may be appropriate, which broadens the focus to a wider definition of customer value - a balance of economic efficiency, reliability, safety and environmental benefits.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, wholesale gas prices have doubled this year. Much of this has been blamed on rising oil prices but other factors are at work. Shippers say a new auction system set up by Ofgem and operated by Transco is inflating prices.</p> <p>Mergers of major producers have created a concentration of power offshore and the European commission is investigating allegations that producers have manipulated prices. A new pipe between Norfolk and Zeebrugge in Belgium connects Britain to the European gas network. Companies using the pipe vote on the day which way gas should flow.

      "bodyText": "Just before Christmas 1999, Andrew and Janette Findlay and their two children, Stacey, 13, and Daryl, 11, were killed when their new bungalow in Larkhall, Lanarkshire, was blown to pieces by a huge gas explosion. The metal gas main near their house had corroded, causing a leak. A spark from a light being switched on or the boiler starting probably caused the blast. When engineers dug up the pipe they reportedly found 19 holes in it. The old system of \"trigger surveys\", to check on mains after snaps of cold weather, had been abandoned by Transco, the privatised monopoly responsible for the gas pipe network. New safety procedures, approved by the health and safety executive (HSE), had been introduced instead. A Transco employee has also said that the company did not have proper records. Engineers called to the area thought new plastic mains had been laid when in fact the old ductile iron mains which suffer from corrosion and can fail suddenly were still in place. In October last year there were more angry relatives and neighbours demanding answers. An elderly couple, William and Mary Bailey, died from burns after a gas explosion ripped through their home in Dundee. Transco had been called to the area four times in the previous 18 months to investigate suspected leaks. In September the HSE passed a report on its Larkhall investigation to the Crown Office, which is expected to decide shortly whether charges should be brought against Transco for culpable homicide or criminal negligence. If it decides not to prosecute there will be a fatal accident inquiry. In Scotland, Larkhall and Dundee are known as the gas industry's Hatfield. South of the border the full implications have yet to sink in. But with other parallels with Railtrack emerging, alarm bells are ringing. Transco says it has fulfilledits safety obligations. It has been considered a well run company, but the question that won't go away is: how do you ensure the safety of an essential service when the owner of the assets is a privatised monopoly with a duty to maximise profits? The much-hyped privatisation of the British Gas Corporation took place in 1986, and was an early Thatcher triumph, with thousands of people rushing to buy shares. In 1996 Britain became the first country in the world to deregulate its energy market when it began to open up the supply of gas to competition. Offshore producers take gas, mostly from the North sea, and land it around the coast. More than 50 shippers and suppliers now compete to sell it to domestic and commercial customers. In 1997 British Gas was split up. A new company, Centrica, now handles accounts and billing, although it still trades under the name British Gas. BG plc was left with offshore exploration and Transco, the privatised monopoly which operates and maintains the pipe network transporting gas from the coast to the meter, and runs the 24 hour gas emergency service. Last year Transco was hived off into the Lattice group. The Lattice group has been under pressure, with share prices falling, and has built up huge debts trying to move into telecoms. Transco's debt book is the largest of any British utility after BT. Transco is restructuring again, splitting its assets (the pipes) from its operations (maintenance and emergency work). These will be further divided into up to 20 units and could be sold off. Industry insiders fear this will \"create another Railtrack\". Deregulation was meant to cut gas bills and, at first sight, five years on it has. Although only 6m out of 20m customers have changed their suppliers, British Gas estimates domestic users have seen their total bills reduced by around \u00a31bn a year. The figures suggest a business success too. British Gas profits in 1985 immediately before privatisation were \u00a3712m, and soared to \u00a31.06bn in 1987. Transco, whose transportation costs account for 40% of domestic gas bills, reported an operating profit pre-deregulation in 1995 of \u00a3780m, and a post-deregulation peak in 1998 of \u00a31.22bn. The picture this year is more troubling. As a privatised monopoly Transco is regulated by Ofgem (the office of gas and electricity markets), which sets price controls. But Ofgem cannot make Transco invest, and Transco underspent on capital expenditure by 23% in 1997 and by 19% in 1998. Now Transco has said it will need to increase spending on mains replacement work by more than 50% over the next three years. To do so it wants to set higher prices. Ofgem has seen its role as a driver of competition. In theory greater competition forces down prices while giving incentives to maintain standards. But utility experts fear there is an inherent conflict. The danger is that if prices are set a company could increase shareholder value only by outwitting the regulator on its costs or spending less later. Only now, five years after deregulation, is Ofgem proposing to introduce medium and long term performance reports to check trends on leakage, pipework replacement and forecasts on future capacity. As with other utilities, the constant hiving off of companies enables the group to realise shareholder value. Bits of the company that are most profitable can be sold off. Foreign utility giants would be keen to get their hands on the assets. They can get a guaranteed return, and if they chose not to invest but just to fix problems then sell on in time, who is to catch up with them? The constant restructuring presents particular difficulties to the safety regulator, the HSE. A spokesman said: \"Every time I blink, something seems to have changed its logo, but whatever happens somebody somewhere will end up with the responsibilities that used to be Transco's.\" Transco has pleaded for a different approach. \"Economic regulation has been dominant,\" it says in submissions to Ofgem. \"Structural changes to promote competition have been encouraged, so far with little consideration of the potential trade-offs against operational integrity and safety. In future a different view may be appropriate, which broadens the focus to a wider definition of customer value - a balance of economic efficiency, reliability, safety and environmental benefits.\" Meanwhile, wholesale gas prices have doubled this year. Much of this has been blamed on rising oil prices but other factors are at work. Shippers say a new auction system set up by Ofgem and operated by Transco is inflating prices. Mergers of major producers have created a concentration of power offshore and the European commission is investigating allegations that producers have manipulated prices. A new pipe between Norfolk and Zeebrugge in Belgium connects Britain to the European gas network. Companies using the pipe vote on the day which way gas should flow. In January, when demand in the UK was high, they voted to export to Europe. UK prices rose by 42%. The Energy Intensive Users Group estimates the recent price rise has cost schools, local authorities, the NHS and commercial users \u00a31bn. And this month suppliers increased domestic gas prices between 5% and 7%. Related stories 'It takes a bang for people to sit up and listen' Gas safety crisis highlighted by insiders",

      "bodyText": "The US media giant, AOL Time Warner, has chosen cable operator NTL as a partner in its bid to boost European revenues. The world's largest media company is seeking a broadband distribution deal across the Atlantic and has made NTL its main target. NTL, which dominates the cable market in the UK and Ireland with 8m subscribers, today stressed the talks were in their early stages. \"We are talking to a broad range of companies about a range of agreements,\" said an NTL spokesperson. \"While it is true that we are in the early stages of talks with AOL, apart from an outline terms sheet nothing has been agreed.\" While AOL Time Warner has an extensive cable network in the US, it lacks a similar operation in Europe, and needs a broadband deal to get the most from its TV, music, film and internet services. The surprise move follows a dramatic week for NTL, in which it raised an extra \u00a3388m in financing but was tipped to run out of money by the end of June by the HSBC investment bank. Despite its pre-eminent position in the UK market, the company's \u00a310bn debt burden remain a source of concern for investors, who want to see a more tangible return from its \"triple play\" offer, in which telecoms, internet and TV services are bundled into one package. NTL insiders have privately scorned the HSBC report, saying its capital expenditure will fall from \u00a31.9bn to \u00a31bn by next year. But AOL Timer Warner is expected to team up with other European cable services, as NTL only has 500,000 subscribers outside the UK and Ireland. Steve Case, the chairman of the \u00a372bn media group, last month said the company will raise its international revenues from 17% to 50% of the total over the next 10 years.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The first thing Kate Hoey would like to point out, as she comes to meet me herself in the reception of the department of culture, media and sport rather than sending a minion, is that she is the Minister for Sport, not the Minister for Football. As she leads the way past the modernist art works that pepper the walls of the department - given its split brief, you half expect to see a rugby boot dissected by Damien Hurst sitting in a tank of formaldehyde on a window ledge - she says it exasperates her that every time she makes a speech detailing government funding policy for the grass roots of sport, or conducts an interview about the new strategy for physical education in primary schools, she happens to make some throwaway, 10-second observation about football and that is what makes the headlines. </p> <p>\"Honestly,\" she says, which is always an awkward word for a politician, \"I think the obsession our media has with football is dangerous, I really do. And I love the game, I'm an Arsenal fan.\" </p> <p>Thus the first impression you get of Hoey is that she can get an awful lot said in a short walk from reception. Still, it would be a shame to disabuse her about the average journalist, so here, in short order are the passing thoughts of the sports minister on our national game, all of them buried deep within a wide-ranging interview. First of all she thinks it's unnecessary for footballers to spit all the time. After all, rugby players don't and they don't choke on accumulated gob. She believes footballers, even if they don't wish to be, are role models to young children and really ought to bear that in mind before they start arguing with referees or fighting on the pitch. She also reckons there is merit in the idea of safe terracing at football grounds, even if her immediate boss, Chris Smith, will have none of it. Oh, and though the Chelsea chairman has consistently implied she did, she denies she ever briefed the press against Ken Bates over the Wembley debacle. \"No I didn't,\" she says. \"One thing about the press, I'm always amazed how much they know without me having to go to the bother of briefing them.\" Which, as a politician's answer, is hard to fault. </p> <p>Indeed as a passionate enthusiast for both politics and sport, Hoey could be said to have arrived at her spiritual home. A graduate in PE with a radical political outlook (not many Ulster unionists got involved in the International Marxist Group in the sixties) even when she was manning the barricades as a revolting student, sport meant everything to her. Later, after she switched from IMG to Labour, she worked for Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs as an education officer. One of her pupils was David Rocastle, which was why she is that rarity among her peers, someone who was genuinely moved when she was obliged recently to give the standard New Labour sound bite about the death of a prominent figure. When she fought a by-election in Vauxhall, she enlisted the help of local lad Michael Thomas, the then championship-winning Arsenal player, in her successful campaign. And her first big parliamentary speech was one which exposed corruption in football, the start of a crusade in which she did not flinch from naming names. As the misogynistic vitriol came back from certain quarters in response, you couldn't help thinking that if those were the people she had upset, her heart must be in the right place. </p> <p>In July 1999 she took over from Tony Banks the government office she always wanted. She had arrived. And, judging by the over-flowing bookshelves in that office, she has been frantically busy ever since, putting herself about the sporting world. There are presentational golf balls and rugby balls and judo kits. There are shields and trophies and certificates. There are photographs with her shaking the hands of the great, the good and Harry Kewell. She has so much stuff, she can pass some of it on. Since politicians are obliged to list gifts they receive from the members of the public lest they be accused of taking secret bribes, I should reveal that the gift this member of the public received from a politician was the cuddly toy emblem of the English Netball Association she had been presented with at a recent international. </p> <p>That she was there to receive it at all, is typical. The minister believes it is important symbolically for her to be seen at events like this, at netball, badminton and judo. It is vital, she says, that the huge spread of sport we enjoy in this country is maintained to give the young as wide a choice as possible in which to express themselves, to steer them away from a life of sloth, crime and expanding waistlines. In short, this is not an office in which the essential moral, physical and spiritual value of sport is remotely in doubt. That is the purpose of her ministry, she says: to ensure access to sport for all. It is as important that children in Hackney learn to swim as it is that England (and Scotland) qualify for Japan and Korea in 2002. Which places the present incumbent of the office a philosophical mile from her predecessor. For Banks there seemed a different point to the job entirely. </p> <p>\"Yes, Tony got completely involved in the World Cup bid and saw it as his major role as sports minister to deliver it,\" she says. </p> <p>And deliver it he did. Unfortunately it was for Germany. But then the obsession with 2006 appeared such a transparently party political one, few outside No 10 can have been too dismayed to see it falter. The idea was that the feelgood factor of hosting the world football championships would translate itself into the votes which would secure a third term for the Blair government. They might think they are, but New Labour are by no means the first to believe there is a link between national sporting and political success. Harold Wilson spotted it, John Major pumped money into Manchester hoping the Olympics would go there in 2000, the first face French people saw on television after their team had won the World Cup was Jacques Chirac's, keen that glory should be reflected in his vote. So, now that the World Cup has gone west, is Tony Blair on the phone demanding his sports minister come up with something else to win him the election? </p> <p>\"I think it's probably a bit late for this election, isn't it?\" she says. \"Look, the Prime Minister understands the genuine importance of sport to the country, but he realises it is about long-term investment. He took great interest in the sports strategy, and I think his support has helped us deliver real extra money including - and this is something the press never seems interested in because it's boringly good news - giving community sports groups charitable status which is going to make an enormous difference.\" </p> <p>Then again, even if he wanted it, the chances of us landing a big sporting event at the moment are about as high as Halifax Town's of winning the Premiership. Although the words piss up and brewery weren't actually used, the recent commons select committee on sport could not have been more direct about the shambles of Wembley, 2006 and the national athletics stadium at Pickett's Lock. So what is going on in sport? It can't be funding, not with the bloated resources of the lottery to hand. Presumably the minister must be dismayed that while her colleagues down the corridor in the arts seem able to boast wonderful lottery projects - the Tate Modern, the Walsall art gallery, the new Sadlers Wells - sport is so abject? \"Well of course the lottery is producing brilliant sporting projects which are making a huge difference to daily lives at a grass roots level but generate zero publicity,\" she says. </p> <p>Maybe, but surely she must look at the sad hulk of Wembley and shiver with embarrassment. \"Wembley is a private sector project,\" she says. \"The lottery money was used to buy the stadium, after that it's been led by football. We as government want to see a successful Wembley, but it's up to football. Ken Bates was leading the stadium team, we weren't represented. He took the decision when to go to the City. All the discussion about athletics being in it made no difference to the planning permission being delayed. When you talk to people about it now, it seems Mr Bates simply didn't keep the rest of the board informed. Most of them didn't know what was going on, so when he said everything's fine, it'll happen, they believed him. It wasn't until Adam Crozier got involved that he discovered things were not as they seemed. I had no personal involvement at all. Let me make this quite clear, Wembley is not a government project. It was and is a football project.\" </p> <p>And she says this with such a tone of regret in her voice, you wonder if the Minister for Sport wouldn't mind, after all, being the Minister for Football. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>The skinny-arsed security man is padding up and down, up and down, the reception of Sinn Fein headquarters. He stares out of the window on to the Falls Road, fag pinched between thumb and forefinger, smoking arm behind back.</p> <p>He looks like a man who has seen a lot. The air is thick with the smell of bacon. We're waiting for the president of Sinn Fein. Sinead on reception watches the people passing on the streets on the CCTV.</p> <p>There is no sign of Adams. The security man keeps padding up and down the reception.</p> <p>The windows are reinforced. You would break your fingers before you could put a fist through one of them.</p> <p>Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA - as it used to be called - is such a complex organisation. With the IRA no longer active, Sinn Fein now has to accommodate both the politicians and the hard men under one umbrella. Often, they are one and the same.</p> <p>I go to the toilet.</p> <p>In the loo, there is a sign: \"Important notice: If you sprinkle, while you tinkle, be a sweetie, wipe the seatie.\"</p> <p>Finally, we are ushered up to see the man himself. These are tricky times for Adams.</p> <p>On the one hand, he seems to have more \"establishment\" support than ever before. On the other, some of his own supporters are wondering what it is they have laid their weapons down for exactly. The Good Friday agreement looks more precarious than ever.</p> <p>The Real IRA is back in bloody business and David Trimble, Adams's partner in peace, looks increasingly vulnerable to those who believe he has also given too much for too little.</p> <p>Gerry Adams, MP for West Belfast, looks like a bear trapped in a politician's suit. Big body, big hair, coffee liqueur of a voice. Scary-cuddly, like a bear. He shakes my hand, and crushes it.</p> <p>He says he is optimistic that Sinn Fein will gain an extra seat in the general election. But isn't he worried about anti-agreement unionists gaining ground too?</p> <p>\"I'm refusing to be pessimistic about this. I think the majority of unionists will respond positively, given positive leadership. But there has been an absence of consistent support for the agreement.</p> <p>\"I think it's a mistake for people to continue to look at it in terms of unionism and nationalism. I think the agreement carved out a new majority, not unionist or nationalist. Without reneging on republicanism, we have to find accommodation with our opponents. If the agreement collapses, it will be proof that unionism isn't up to the challenge of finding accommodation with its neighbours. But I refuse to give you a line saying the agreement could collapse. Of course it could. Many republicans argue it isn't delivering now. But if it collapses on Monday, on Tuesday we have to put it together again. We have to have a long-term strategic view of this. We need to look at this 10 years up the road.\"</p> <p>Sinn Fein has predicted that in 10 years there could be a Catholic majority in Northern Ireland. The census is expected to show that already 46% of Northern Ireland is Catholic. I suggest that perhaps republicans could just wait till there's a natural majority and then hold a referendum. Adams laughs at the idea.</p> <p>\"Outbreeding unionists may be an enjoyable pastime for those who have the energy, but it hardly amounts to a political strategy.

Again, in 1972, he was the youngest of a group of men flown secretly to Britain to negotiate with the then home secretary Willie Whitelaw. Until seven years ago the British were not even allowed to hear Adams's voice on television or radio - his words had to be mouthed by an actor.</p> <p>Both Adams and McGuinness are still believed to be on the army council, the governing body of the IRA.</p> <p>'Ach, that's rubbish,\" he says.</p> <p>Adams has never talked about his IRA involvement for pragmatic reasons - IRA membership remains a criminal offence. But his involvement in the IRA is the one thing most of us want to know about. Not just enemies, but also friends and sympathisers. Not simply to call him to account, but out of sheer curiosity. We talk about the truth and reconciliation process in South Africa.</p> <p>Adams has visited the country many times, and sees it as a model for Northern Ireland. He calls Nelson Mandela one of his heroes.</p> <p>I ask him when he will be able to do what so many former terrorists have done in South Africa - come clean about his past. Will he ever admit that he carried bombs or killed in the name of his cause? \"Well, you'd be asking to make something up if you're asking me to give you that story.\"</p> <p>But wouldn't he like to be able to say he did this or he did that for the IRA, and this is why? Sometimes, you feel, you're better off talking in euphemisms to Adams.</p> <p>\"Well, I haven't even contemplated any of that. My position has been very, very clear in all of these matters. It is obviously part of the reclamation, or the reownership, or the reconquest of our people to tell their story. When I wrote Before The Dawn I made it quite clear that there are lots of people involved in my life who I can't talk about simply because I'd put them at risk. At some point it may be possible to lift the lid on different aspects of this, but it isn't something I'm concerned or worried about.\"</p> <p>Adams is 52. He doesn't talk about his family in interviews.</p> <p>He has been married to Colette McArdle for 30 years, and they have one son, a teacher and gaelic footballer. Adams has spent most of his married life away from his family, moving from safehouse to safehouse.</p> <p>He has a 16-month-old granddaughter, and it has been suggested that he has softened since becoming a grandfather.</p> <p>Would he be happy for her to grow up involved in the struggle? \"It's hard to think of a 16-month child being anything other than a delight to be around. I've not thought about it,\" he says, unconvincingly.</p> <p>He still seems to be thinking about lifting the lid.</p> <p>\"There is a need for processes of truth, there is no doubt of that. I think the worst kind of grief is unacknowledged grief. There is a very long wound in the nationalist community because of the number of people who have been killed by British soldiers.\"</p> <p>But he says Northern Ireland is a long way away from a formal truth and reconciliation process.</p> <p>\"If the truth and reconciliation process had happened in South Africa before the settlement, there might not have been a settlement because it's so traumatic. It happened after the settlement, and was part of developing a process of closure, and a new beginning.\"</p> <p>There is still too much unfinished business in the north, Adams says.</p> <p>Anyway, he adds, forgiveness cannot simply be a political construct, it has to be on a personal basis.</p> <p>\"If I didn't forgive the people who took me into the barracks and beat me unconscious over a period of days during the period when the British state was indicted for inhuman and degrading treatment in 1971-72, or even the guys who shot me, if you don't forgive them, you end up with unnecessary baggage. I have no wish to carry that baggage. These people did what they thought was right. Or maybe they didn't think about it at all. Maybe they did it instinctively, as happens sometimes when people lose control, when there's a particular regime in place.\"</p> <p>He was shot five times. I ask him where the wounds are. He points to his upper chest, neck and shoulders. Can I see them?</p> <p>\"No,\" he says, with his coffee-liqueur laugh.</p> <p>\"You'll want to stick your fingers in them.\"</p> <p>It is a typical Adams response: allusive, biblical, multi-layered. He should have gone to university, but chose to work in a bar instead - more politically grounded, he thought.</p> <p>Adams has written poems, short stories and his autobiography. He says, casually, that he would rather write than be a politician. He would really like to give up politics?</p> <p>\"Yes.\" When? \"Now. But I realise I can't do it.\" Really, truly? \"I would. I genuinely would. I'd prefer that I wasn't involved in political struggle. I can think of numerous things that I could do with my life, and I enjoy life hugely. Even a year off would be something, but somebody has to do it. If I wasn't doing it, somebody else would be.\"</p> <p>He stresses and re-stresses there is nothing unusual about him.</p> <p>Whenever anyone enters the office, as they often do, he tells me how much longer than him they spent in jail.</p> <p>In one of his earliest interviews, Adams said that he reckoned he had a 90% chance of being killed.</p> <p>Did he expect to be alive now? \"At this moment?\" He smiles.</p> <p>\"After the coffee?\" He laughs. Shakes like a bear.</p> <p>\"To tell you the truth, I'm not fixated by this question of death, or its proximity.</p> <p>There are obviously dangers in what you do, but somebody has to do it,\" he says yet again.</p> <p>He's seen so much death, he's been responsible for so much death: why should his life be sacrosanct? Surely he must have felt isolated, seeing so many people die around him?</p> <p>\"I've never felt isolated. I've felt alone, I've felt depressed, I've felt cheesed off, the same as anybody would, but I've never felt isolated. Never. Never .\"</p> <p>A few minutes later he, typically, returns to an earlier point. There is something so dogged, so obdurate, about Adams.</p> <p>\"Now going right back to your question about depression\u0085 you are victim to the ordinary depressions, insecurities and doubts you get as a human being. When was I depressed? When my mother died. I was depressed when many good friends were killed. I was depressed in prison.\"</p> <p>He talks about some of the deaths that have affected him most - his mum, his two nephews killed in a car crash, his friend Cleeky Clarke, who recently died of cancer.</p> <p>He seems to find these deaths more unbearable than those of comrades killed by the British Army - at least they died for a cause. Cleeky Clarke was his minder in latter years, and much more. They were mates in Long Kesh, Cleeky always getting him into trouble with \"his harebrained ideas to escape or some other completely imbecilic notion\".</p> <p>Why was escaping a harebrained notion?</p> <p>\"Because I was the world's worst would-be escaper. I actually ended up in prison for trying to escape. I was interned without trial, tried to escape twice, and was caught twice.\"</p> <p>The talk turns to Tony Blair.</p> <p>Does he consider the prime minister a moral man? \"Depends whose advice he's taking.\" He stops himself.</p> <p>\"That's probably an impertinent thing to say, an imprudent thing to say in terms of this peace process.</p> <p>Yes, I think this British government is different from previous British governments but, and I've told Tony Blair this, the question of a British policy in Ireland will be the most difficult issue he faces as prime minister. The foot and mouth thing is a big issue, the euro is a big issue, but the question of Ireland will continue to dog the relationship between these two islands unless Mr Blair is prepared to rise to the challenge.\"</p> <p>I ask him whether there is a unionist he admires.</p> <p>\"Well, I do think David Trimble is very good at what he does.</p> <p>I mean, David Trimble, from a unionist perspective, has been able to get a British government to pander to his every whim by working on the inside of the agreement to actually prevent the implementation of that agreement.</p> <p>Maybe I give him too much credit, but I do think he's a skilled politician.\"</p> <p>So Sinn Fein would be happy to see the embattled Trimble fall? No, he says, the party's position is clear - it needs a unionist party to work with in order to implement the Good Friday agreement, and it has given Trimble as much support as possible.</p> <p>Adams has talked so much about his capacity for forgiveness. Does he feel he has anything to be forgiven for?</p> <p>\"I don't think we would be at the point we are now if we had not come through the conflict, and if there had not been an armed struggle as part of all of that. Now I wish that it was different. I actually wonder at different times why it was not possible to get to this point before we got to it.\"</p> <p>Does he still go to confession? \"Yes,\" he says.</p> <p>Has he confessed to the really nasty things he has done in the past? He doesn't answer, but I suppose it is a vague question.</p> <p>Have you ever put a gun to anyone's head? \"No.\"</p> <p>He always thought that was something for others to do? \"No, it never entered into the possibilities.\"</p> <p>I remind him of a short story he once wrote in which a young gunman, sweating and palpitating before the moment of action, wonders whether it is more noble to be shot than to do the shooting. I say it sounded like a personal dilemma.</p> <p>Adams seems annoyed.</p> <p>\"Well, I think it's interesting that, seven years into an IRA cessation, and we're talking about all of that. But there you are\u0085 If you start to explore the use of violence, I think there's a tremendous amount of hypocrisy in it.</p> <p>I mean, Martin Luther King described violence as the language of the unheard.\"</p> <p>He embarks on one of those elaborate sentences he excels in.</p> <p>\"So if you find people in a partitioned Ireland - who are not treated as badly as people in South Africa, not as badly as the Jewish people were, not as badly as the Palestinian people - resort to armed action, whether that is right or wrong is something else, then you find the establishment which has built itself out of violence, depicts these people as terrorists.\"</p> <p>He says all wars are dirty wars, and make no mistake: this has been a war.</p> <p>\"You know there's the age-old argument about Washington - terrorist or patriot? And Mandela. There's a slogan that says the victor writes the history.\"</p> <p>And, of course, he eventually returns to the original question.</p> <p>\"Let me come back to the confession thing. You tell sins in confession.\"</p> <p>Silence.</p> <p>Pardon, I say.</p> <p>\"You tell sins or what you think are sins in confession.\"</p> <p>And another silence. I look him in the eye. He looks me in the eye. I want to look away or blink, but feel that I cannot. We are eyeballing each other.</p> <p>I want to ask him what he means, but I know it is the most eloquent and honest answer he could give.</p> <p>It is a stand off. Eventually, he laughs.</p> <p>\"We're going to look at each other a long time,\" he says.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The skinny-arsed security man is padding up and down, up and down, the reception of Sinn Fein headquarters. He stares out of the window on to the Falls Road, fag pinched between thumb and forefinger, smoking arm behind back. He looks like a man who has seen a lot. The air is thick with the smell of bacon. We're waiting for the president of Sinn Fein. Sinead on reception watches the people passing on the streets on the CCTV. There is no sign of Adams. The security man keeps padding up and down the reception. The windows are reinforced. You would break your fingers before you could put a fist through one of them. Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA - as it used to be called - is such a complex organisation. With the IRA no longer active, Sinn Fein now has to accommodate both the politicians and the hard men under one umbrella. Often, they are one and the same. I go to the toilet. In the loo, there is a sign: \"Important notice: If you sprinkle, while you tinkle, be a sweetie, wipe the seatie.\" Finally, we are ushered up to see the man himself. These are tricky times for Adams. On the one hand, he seems to have more \"establishment\" support than ever before. On the other, some of his own supporters are wondering what it is they have laid their weapons down for exactly. The Good Friday agreement looks more precarious than ever. The Real IRA is back in bloody business and David Trimble, Adams's partner in peace, looks increasingly vulnerable to those who believe he has also given too much for too little. Gerry Adams, MP for West Belfast, looks like a bear trapped in a politician's suit. Big body, big hair, coffee liqueur of a voice. Scary-cuddly, like a bear. He shakes my hand, and crushes it. He says he is optimistic that Sinn Fein will gain an extra seat in the general election. But isn't he worried about anti-agreement unionists gaining ground too? \"I'm refusing to be pessimistic about this. I think the majority of unionists will respond positively, given positive leadership. But there has been an absence of consistent support for the agreement. \"I think it's a mistake for people to continue to look at it in terms of unionism and nationalism. I think the agreement carved out a new majority, not unionist or nationalist. Without reneging on republicanism, we have to find accommodation with our opponents. If the agreement collapses, it will be proof that unionism isn't up to the challenge of finding accommodation with its neighbours. But I refuse to give you a line saying the agreement could collapse. Of course it could. Many republicans argue it isn't delivering now. But if it collapses on Monday, on Tuesday we have to put it together again. We have to have a long-term strategic view of this. We need to look at this 10 years up the road.\" Sinn Fein has predicted that in 10 years there could be a Catholic majority in Northern Ireland. The census is expected to show that already 46% of Northern Ireland is Catholic. I suggest that perhaps republicans could just wait till there's a natural majority and then hold a referendum. Adams laughs at the idea. \"Outbreeding unionists may be an enjoyable pastime for those who have the energy, but it hardly amounts to a political strategy. We can't give up on the task of winning unionists over.\" What about the Real IRA? Does it pose a real threat to peace? \"Yes.Yes and no. Yes in so far as they appear to have some capacity to carry out operations. No in that they have no possibility of having popular support. Or no possibility of succeeding because they don't have a strategy.\" The door opens and a head pops round. \"All right?\"says the disembodied head. \"All right, minister,\" Adams says with a smile. The visitor is Martin McGuinness. \"I should have said, 'Yes, minister',\" grins Adams. Both McGuinness and Adams still take boyish pleasure at his new status as education minister in the Stormont Assembly. While McGuinness is generally acknowledged as having been the commander of the IRA's Derry Brigade during the bloody events of 1972, Adams's paramilitary background remains more opaque. According to British Army intelligence reports, at 23 he was the commanding officer of the IRA Second Battalion in Belfast. Adams was interned in Long Kesh twice for suspected terrorist activity. He has always denied his alleged links to the Bloody Friday bombing campaign of July 1972. Again, in 1972, he was the youngest of a group of men flown secretly to Britain to negotiate with the then home secretary Willie Whitelaw. Until seven years ago the British were not even allowed to hear Adams's voice on television or radio - his words had to be mouthed by an actor.

      "body": "<p>Two years ago, having just given birth to my first child at 5am, an unexpected acceleration in labour meant that I missed out on the epidural I wanted, and I was feeling pretty sore about it in more ways than one. But uppermost in my mind, with my newborn and husband crashed out asleep together in the armchair, was a craving for a cup of tea and a bacon sandwich.</p> <p>Sadly, at that hour, no one was taking orders for a fry-up. If asked for a personal recommendation on how to modernise maternity services, \"bacon and anaesthetists\" would have been my reply.</p> <p>Bacon aside, the care from staff at Pontefract hospital was excellent. According to an audit commission survey a few years ago, most women say that they are pleased with the care they receive. The trouble is that there are wide variations in maternity services across the country. These limit rather than extend the choices offered to women and their partners at a critical time in their lives.</p> <p>Perhaps most important of all, those variations often reflect deep-rooted inequalities. The founding principles of the NHS are that healthcare should be free at the point of use, based on need, not ability to pay. That means ensuring that those in greatest need do not have least access to health services. Nowhere is this more important than at the very beginning of a child's life.</p> <p>So as part of a plan to tackle child poverty and give every child the best start, Alan Milburn, the health secretary, will set out this week a major programme of modernisation in our maternity services. That means investment in facilities and recruitment, improvements to screening and the beginnings of a major scheme of national standards in maternity and children's health. We need such new standards to ensure proper safety and high-quality care in every area.</p> <p>Now in the sixth month of my second pregnancy, I know from personal experience that different places can have very different approaches. The consequence of travelling each week between Westminster and my constituency is signing up for maternity care at both ends of the country. After all, it's hard to predict where I will be when labour starts. All mothers know that drawing up birth plans can prove pointless when labour takes a different course.

      "bodyText": "Two years ago, having just given birth to my first child at 5am, an unexpected acceleration in labour meant that I missed out on the epidural I wanted, and I was feeling pretty sore about it in more ways than one. But uppermost in my mind, with my newborn and husband crashed out asleep together in the armchair, was a craving for a cup of tea and a bacon sandwich. Sadly, at that hour, no one was taking orders for a fry-up. If asked for a personal recommendation on how to modernise maternity services, \"bacon and anaesthetists\" would have been my reply. Bacon aside, the care from staff at Pontefract hospital was excellent. According to an audit commission survey a few years ago, most women say that they are pleased with the care they receive. The trouble is that there are wide variations in maternity services across the country. These limit rather than extend the choices offered to women and their partners at a critical time in their lives. Perhaps most important of all, those variations often reflect deep-rooted inequalities. The founding principles of the NHS are that healthcare should be free at the point of use, based on need, not ability to pay. That means ensuring that those in greatest need do not have least access to health services. Nowhere is this more important than at the very beginning of a child's life. So as part of a plan to tackle child poverty and give every child the best start, Alan Milburn, the health secretary, will set out this week a major programme of modernisation in our maternity services. That means investment in facilities and recruitment, improvements to screening and the beginnings of a major scheme of national standards in maternity and children's health. We need such new standards to ensure proper safety and high-quality care in every area. Now in the sixth month of my second pregnancy, I know from personal experience that different places can have very different approaches. The consequence of travelling each week between Westminster and my constituency is signing up for maternity care at both ends of the country. After all, it's hard to predict where I will be when labour starts. All mothers know that drawing up birth plans can prove pointless when labour takes a different course. Discussing epidurals with two sets of midwives proved doubly redundant but provided an interesting insight into the variations that exist. Different units offer different tests at different points in pregnancy. In fact if you switch hospitals at the right point, you can probably clock up six different tests for Down's syndrome (scans, double and triple tests galore) and each will give you a slightly different result. One of the first areas in which we are introducing national standards involves the screening and counselling support to be offered for certain tests in pregnancy and newborns so that parents have a proper, informed choice about which tests they want. Work is under way too on clinical standards around the management of labour, particularly when problems arise, including induction, fetal monitoring and Caesareans. Second, as investment in the NHS grows, we need to address the backlog in underinvestment that can have a huge impact on family experience. Staff are often working extremely hard, but having to contend with outdated, rundown facilities. Some units offer home-from-home comforts, perhaps with separate midwife-led facilities. Others have cramped labour wards that look more like Victorian operating theatres. In Pontefract there were TVs in individual rooms on the labour ward, in theory to provide distraction during a long labour.

But his exclusive contract, thought to be worth about \u00a3500,000 a year, will cover radio only. The BBC's decision means that Wogan could be signed up by other television broadcasters. His old BBC1 chatshow, Wogan, has been criticised for being anodyne but was popular with viewers.",

      "trailText": "<p>From trucking to television - Gerry Murphy's move to head up Carlton was greeted with bemusement eight months ago. Can he deliver the goods in media? asks  David Teather.</p>",
      "byline": "David Teather",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Gerry Murphy, the chief executive of Carlton Communications, is doing his best to insist he is a big fan of Crossroads, the company's flagship soap. </p> <p>When does he get time to watch it? \"It's on in the staff cafe at lunchtimes,\" he says. So who is his favourite character? A pause. \"The young chap who showed up on a motorbike in the very first episode. There's this wonderful scene where a young guy on a motorbike put-put-puts into the car park - the bright young thing in the cast.\" The answer reminds me of English lit students asked to pick a passage from a novel in a seminar. You could always tell who hadn't read the book because they would plump for something from the opening chapter. </p> <p>When Murphy took the chief executive's job at Carlton last summer, the common, sniffy, question was \"Gerry who?\" The genial Irishman had little, well no, experience in media and his immediate background had been running the logistics (that's trucking) group National Freight Consortium (NFC). </p> <p>Eight months later he openly admits he is in no position to make editorial judgments but he has, in a relatively short period, built up a body of corporate work with which to answer the critics, culminating in last week's announcement that Carlton and Granada would work together in digital and online under a single ITV brand. </p> <p>In February last year, while at NFC, Murphy had played a part in a merger with rival logistics business Ocean, a deal well liked by the City. He cleared the path for his opposite number at Ocean to take the top job and found himself praised for his self-effacement by former NFC chairman and outgoing BBC chief, Sir Christopher Bland. \"Ego trips can get in the way of these kind of mergers. It's a tribute to Gerry that this didn't happen,\" he said at the time. </p> <p>His departure from NFC, \u00a31.5m the richer, led to a phone call from Carlton chairman Michael Green asking if he would be prepared to join the company if the merger with United fell apart. His predecessor, Steven Cain, had already gone in anticipation of losing his job in the deal. </p> <p>Murphy joined Carlton in the wake of the aborted merger with Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media. The merger would have helped the company leapfrog Granada to become the prime force in ITV, but it was blocked, Granada stepped in and Carlton's hopes were dashed. Murphy, 44, had to pick up the pieces. Virtually on his first day he had to play a part in deciding whether Carlton should pursue HTV, which Granada had to sell for regulatory reasons. Then came his first set of negotiations with Steve Morrison, his opposite number at Granada. \"A very deep-end experience,\" Murphy recalls. \"The conclusion we came to was that the strategy of three into two was right for ITV and we would be one of those two. We started to negotiate with HTV almost on the first day of my job.\" </p> <p>Murphy has gone on to play a significant role in the reshaping of the business. Technicolor was sold for \u00a31.4bn, a far better price than many had believed Carlton would get in the current economic climate. </p> <p>Many have regarded Murphy's depth of experience in running companies as an important foil to what can euphemistically be described as Green's big personality. Murphy played a significant role in turning around the fortunes of NFC and Green has pretty much left him alone at Carlton, according to insiders. Tellingly, on the day of last week's announcement of the restructuring of ITV, Green left Murphy to face the press as he flew to New York for a meeting. </p> <p>Murphy describes his relationship with Green as \"good\". Has he lost his temper with him yet? \"We have our moments,\" he replies. \"We're very different and come from very different places every which way, but I think that's what makes it work. You don't work with challenging, demanding, stimulating people without the occasional moment but it's healthy, lively, robust and it's fun. </p> <p>\"There are many misconceptions about Michael. One is that he is a bully and domineering. Well ,he hasn't been. Two, that he is very involved in the day-to-day business. He's not. Three is that he interferes. Actually he doesn't.\" </p> <p>Green returns the compliments. \"A good relationship between a chairman and a chief executive is vital,\" he says. \"I like working with Gerry because he gets to the point quickly and he makes it fun.\" Insiders say that with Murphy's arrival they have seen Green relax about the day-to-day business for the first time. According to one ITV source Murphy is \"very pragmatic, someone who listens and is without ego, which is probably because he doesn't come from this industry.\" </p> <p>The restructuring of ITV will see Carlton and Granada's joint pay television business renamed ITV Digital to exploit the stronger brand.

ONdigital boss Stuart Prebble was named as ITV chief executive, a post which had lain vacant for the past 15 months. The plan is the closest they are likely to get to a single ITV company for many years to come. </p> <p>Murphy suggests it was helpful in developing a better relationship between Carlton and Granada that both companies had relatively new chief executives - Steve Morrison took over at Granada when it demerged from the hospitality group last year. </p> <p>\"We're actually pretty complementary,\" he says. \"I'm new to TV, but have been a chief executive for 10 years. Steve has spent his life in TV but is a new chief executive. There are things we can learn from each other.

But he and I get on well together.\" </p> <p>Morrison says both he and Murphy \"came to it with the same attitudes of clearing out the baggage\" of old rivalries. \"Gerry is very straightforward and very good to deal with,\" he says. </p> <p>Few observers doubt the logic of the two companies working more closely together, or of exploiting the ITV brand. But the shares of both fell on the day, principally because of concerns about the future of ONdigital. As long as the markets were going in the right direction investors were happy enough, but in the present climate the amount of cash being soaked up by the business has caused increasing concern. ONdigital has now retrenched and is aiming for a more modest 1.7m customers by 2003/4 against 2m by the end of 2002. From the \u00a3300m it said would be invested at launch, the sum spiralled to \u00a31.2bn which it last week cut back to \u00a31.1bn in a nod to shareholders. </p> <p>Murphy thinks much of the criticism has been unjustified. \"I can appreciate the miracle of achieving a subscriber base of 1m in two years from a standing start. Logistically that is nothing short of extraordinary. I don't see ONdigital as a failure. The reason the cash consumption has been higher than originally expected was that the business model changed with Sky's launch of free set-top boxes which changed the rules. The rapid growth of the digital TV market has been significantly fuelled by equipment giveaways. But there are two sides to this. One, we have the highest digital penetration in Europe. Two, it's cost us a lot of money to get there, and it's cost Sky more.\" Prebble's promotion he says is an endorsement of their belief in the platform. \"He has done a phenomenal job in the face of the most aggressive competitor on the planet. </p> <p>The bigger story here may take some time to be properly understood. We have combined the most powerful information and marketing medium in the UK, ITV, with new digital channels, with a new internet proposition and with a pay platform. And that is unique. Given the power of that brand and the sheer visibility of ITV - 90% of all people in the UK watch ITV every week - that is an extraordinary presence.

      "bodyText": "Gerry Murphy, the chief executive of Carlton Communications, is doing his best to insist he is a big fan of Crossroads, the company's flagship soap. When does he get time to watch it? \"It's on in the staff cafe at lunchtimes,\" he says. So who is his favourite character? A pause. \"The young chap who showed up on a motorbike in the very first episode. There's this wonderful scene where a young guy on a motorbike put-put-puts into the car park - the bright young thing in the cast.\" The answer reminds me of English lit students asked to pick a passage from a novel in a seminar. You could always tell who hadn't read the book because they would plump for something from the opening chapter. When Murphy took the chief executive's job at Carlton last summer, the common, sniffy, question was \"Gerry who?\" The genial Irishman had little, well no, experience in media and his immediate background had been running the logistics (that's trucking) group National Freight Consortium (NFC). Eight months later he openly admits he is in no position to make editorial judgments but he has, in a relatively short period, built up a body of corporate work with which to answer the critics, culminating in last week's announcement that Carlton and Granada would work together in digital and online under a single ITV brand. In February last year, while at NFC, Murphy had played a part in a merger with rival logistics business Ocean, a deal well liked by the City. He cleared the path for his opposite number at Ocean to take the top job and found himself praised for his self-effacement by former NFC chairman and outgoing BBC chief, Sir Christopher Bland. \"Ego trips can get in the way of these kind of mergers. It's a tribute to Gerry that this didn't happen,\" he said at the time. His departure from NFC, \u00a31.5m the richer, led to a phone call from Carlton chairman Michael Green asking if he would be prepared to join the company if the merger with United fell apart. His predecessor, Steven Cain, had already gone in anticipation of losing his job in the deal. Murphy joined Carlton in the wake of the aborted merger with Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media. The merger would have helped the company leapfrog Granada to become the prime force in ITV, but it was blocked, Granada stepped in and Carlton's hopes were dashed. Murphy, 44, had to pick up the pieces. Virtually on his first day he had to play a part in deciding whether Carlton should pursue HTV, which Granada had to sell for regulatory reasons. Then came his first set of negotiations with Steve Morrison, his opposite number at Granada. \"A very deep-end experience,\" Murphy recalls. \"The conclusion we came to was that the strategy of three into two was right for ITV and we would be one of those two. We started to negotiate with HTV almost on the first day of my job.\" Murphy has gone on to play a significant role in the reshaping of the business. Technicolor was sold for \u00a31.4bn, a far better price than many had believed Carlton would get in the current economic climate. Many have regarded Murphy's depth of experience in running companies as an important foil to what can euphemistically be described as Green's big personality. Murphy played a significant role in turning around the fortunes of NFC and Green has pretty much left him alone at Carlton, according to insiders. Tellingly, on the day of last week's announcement of the restructuring of ITV, Green left Murphy to face the press as he flew to New York for a meeting. Murphy describes his relationship with Green as \"good\". Has he lost his temper with him yet? \"We have our moments,\" he replies. \"We're very different and come from very different places every which way, but I think that's what makes it work. You don't work with challenging, demanding, stimulating people without the occasional moment but it's healthy, lively, robust and it's fun. \"There are many misconceptions about Michael. One is that he is a bully and domineering. Well ,he hasn't been. Two, that he is very involved in the day-to-day business. He's not. Three is that he interferes. Actually he doesn't.\" Green returns the compliments. \"A good relationship between a chairman and a chief executive is vital,\" he says. \"I like working with Gerry because he gets to the point quickly and he makes it fun.\" Insiders say that with Murphy's arrival they have seen Green relax about the day-to-day business for the first time. According to one ITV source Murphy is \"very pragmatic, someone who listens and is without ego, which is probably because he doesn't come from this industry.\" The restructuring of ITV will see Carlton and Granada's joint pay television business renamed ITV Digital to exploit the stronger brand. The two companies also announced the launch of website itv.com and ITV Sport, a premium sports channel, the first of many digital channels in the pipelines. ONdigital boss Stuart Prebble was named as ITV chief executive, a post which had lain vacant for the past 15 months. The plan is the closest they are likely to get to a single ITV company for many years to come.

      "body": "<p>Maybe it's the fact that his beloved Arsenal's Champions League bid fizzled out like a Junior Disprin the night before, but Jonathan Glazer is in a contemplative mood when we meet. His main concern isn't the football, though. It's his new commercial for Guinness - Dream Club - and whether or not the advert is leaving audiences a little bewildered. Could this just be that sense of deflation you get when you finish a job? </p> <p>\"It's a particularly flat feeling because I don't think I nailed it,\" says Glazer. \"I don't think it doesn't work, but I think there's a certain thing I wanted out of it that I don't think I achieved.\" </p> <p>With directors there's a clear distinction between those for whom directing is a very personal experience and those able to take on commercial work, distance themselves from it, and produce what the client wants, earning a healthy fee in the process. Glazer is clearly of the former school and is brutally honest in his opinion of his work: it rarely hits exactly what he's looking for. But it's not the final result so much as the medium he's working in - Glazer doesn't feel advertising requires the kind of depths he wants to take it to. He's not an adman. </p> <p>The irony is, of course, that in his quest for perfection he's come up with some of the best adverts in recent years, although this not a fact he seems particularly proud of. </p> <p>\"I'm angry that I've landed for the early part of my career in that field - yes, of course it's given me incredible benefits: a house, holidays when I want holidays. For fuck's sake, I have nothing to complain about other than the fact that I'm in an area which demands something of me which I'm uncomfortable with, which is like: 'We don't want it to be that emotional, we don't want it to be that honest, we don't want it to be a truthful piece of work, we just want to sell our jeans thank you very much.' They're willing to cut off at that point and I'm not. So I'm kind of in the wrong business. </p> <p>\"Advertising has never been something that I've aspired to and has never been something that I've driven myself towards,\" he says. The pleasure he derived from having his surfer commercial voted as best ever by the readers of the Sunday Times and Channel 4 viewers is because it's a public vote of confidence, not a dry industry panel choosing to anoint one director over another. He also points out that polls are often about timing. </p> <p>But the mere fact that we're sitting talking about a commercial that is now nearly two years old is testament to the fact that in some way it has managed to transcend that notion of timing. </p> <p>Glazer's showreel views like a dream CV for most directors - the Guinness Swimmer advert; the Stella Artois Jean de Florette pastiches; music videos for Radiohead's Street Spirit and Karma Police and, of course, Guinness Surfer. But he's not a man to rest on his laurels or re-tread a safe path. Its black-and-white film stock and voice-over artist apart, Dream Club is about as far removed from the atavistic simplicity of Surfer as a director can get. </p> <p>\"Surfer was immediately accessi ble - it was one for the boys. It's a dream scenario for somebody who's paying a million quid to have their pint advertised, and the pressures are to repeat that,\" he says. </p> <p>While he claims not to have felt any external pressure to come up with something that would trump Surfer, he gives the impression that he was impatient with the whole idea of doing something again and probably afraid that he wouldn't enjoy himself in the process. The last thing he wanted to do, he says, was create a rod for his back by trying to remake the advert. </p> <p>Glazer's career began in the cutting room, creating TV trailers for films. A skill which has probably shaped his ability to tell a story in a short time. \"You're telling stories in cuts, you're being succinct. And there's an energy and pace that comes from that you could say is a bad habit,\" he explains. </p> <p>A bad habit, perhaps, but an essential skill when it comes to creating a commercial. When I press for his slant on his success, he's quick to cite the team behind him. He says that only painters and writers have the ability to produce great work without collaborating. He says he can't do it. </p> <p>\"The things I've made in commercials I've only been able to do because of those collaborations,\" he says, going on to point out that on his cur rent commercial he had another sack of Guinness's money to spend relatively freely. When three scenes he'd shot were dropped from the final cut Guinness were informed, not asked - a job left to the commercial's writer, Walter Campbell from Abbott Mead Vickers, who smooths these decisions over with the client. </p> <p>\"I can only read the colour of his face every time I see him to realise what battles he goes through. I couldn't have made it without him,\" claims Glazer. </p> <p>He predicts that Dream Club is his last Guinness commercial and admits that if the film projects were there and rolled into production in the same way that his commercials and promos work has, he'd give up adverts all together. </p> <p>Last year he directed his first feature - Sexy Beast, a gangster film which garnered critical acclaim and managed to stand out from the crop of Brit gangster flicks around at the time. Glazer was, of course, unhappy with the film. </p> <p>\"I remember reading this Gore Vidal thing the other day and he said he was watching a film and it was like 40 commercials looking for a product. I thought: 'God forbid that I should be that.' The films I admire aren't that, and the films I want to make aren't that. But Sexy Beast, to an extent, was that.\" </p> <p>Glazer's fear is that he's not going to be able to make the transition into what he really wants to be and claims he'd rather drive a cab than do anything in a mediocre way. </p> <p>Is he just another commercials director with a craving for film credibility? \"To be honest with you, it's not a new thing at all,\" he says, citing directors like Ridley and Tony Scott, conceding that the work that ex-advert directors are producing is probably better and more influential than it used to be. </p> <p>One of the curses of being a perfectionist is never being able to see the wood for the trees - audiences, peers and judging panels enjoy something in Glazer's work which he remains unhappy about. Industry gongs such as his unprecedented two D&amp;AD gold arrows for That Advert go some way to ameliorating a feeling of anger at being left stranded in the commercials market, but the ability to get out and make work without any limitations is what really matters to Glazer, a freedom he's only really experienced in his music video work. </p> <p>\"If you're working with an artist who has the confidence to know what they're about, then it's you and them and that's it, the business takes care of itself because it's a better product ultimately, so they sell more albums and everyone's happy. As long as they do that it affords you choice and freedom.\" </p> <p>He believes he'll get this freedom with his next film. It's unclear which of the three projects he's currently working will make it, but the most interesting would be a collaboration with veteran French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re (The Tin Drum, Belle de Jour). Glazer doesn't want to talk in detail about it, but at its simplest it's a personal project about a 10-year-old boy falling in love with a 35-year-old woman. It will, of course, be made with Glazer's near obsessional attention to detail. Something he feels he'll never get with commercials, a situation he's obviously wrestling with.</p>",

For fuck's sake, I have nothing to complain about other than the fact that I'm in an area which demands something of me which I'm uncomfortable with, which is like: 'We don't want it to be that emotional, we don't want it to be that honest, we don't want it to be a truthful piece of work, we just want to sell our jeans thank you very much.' They're willing to cut off at that point and I'm not. So I'm kind of in the wrong business. \"Advertising has never been something that I've aspired to and has never been something that I've driven myself towards,\" he says. The pleasure he derived from having his surfer commercial voted as best ever by the readers of the Sunday Times and Channel 4 viewers is because it's a public vote of confidence, not a dry industry panel choosing to anoint one director over another. He also points out that polls are often about timing. But the mere fact that we're sitting talking about a commercial that is now nearly two years old is testament to the fact that in some way it has managed to transcend that notion of timing. Glazer's showreel views like a dream CV for most directors - the Guinness Swimmer advert; the Stella Artois Jean de Florette pastiches; music videos for Radiohead's Street Spirit and Karma Police and, of course, Guinness Surfer. But he's not a man to rest on his laurels or re-tread a safe path. Its black-and-white film stock and voice-over artist apart, Dream Club is about as far removed from the atavistic simplicity of Surfer as a director can get. \"Surfer was immediately accessi ble - it was one for the boys. It's a dream scenario for somebody who's paying a million quid to have their pint advertised, and the pressures are to repeat that,\" he says. While he claims not to have felt any external pressure to come up with something that would trump Surfer, he gives the impression that he was impatient with the whole idea of doing something again and probably afraid that he wouldn't enjoy himself in the process. The last thing he wanted to do, he says, was create a rod for his back by trying to remake the advert. Glazer's career began in the cutting room, creating TV trailers for films. A skill which has probably shaped his ability to tell a story in a short time. \"You're telling stories in cuts, you're being succinct. And there's an energy and pace that comes from that you could say is a bad habit,\" he explains. A bad habit, perhaps, but an essential skill when it comes to creating a commercial. When I press for his slant on his success, he's quick to cite the team behind him. He says that only painters and writers have the ability to produce great work without collaborating. He says he can't do it. \"The things I've made in commercials I've only been able to do because of those collaborations,\" he says, going on to point out that on his cur rent commercial he had another sack of Guinness's money to spend relatively freely. When three scenes he'd shot were dropped from the final cut Guinness were informed, not asked - a job left to the commercial's writer, Walter Campbell from Abbott Mead Vickers, who smooths these decisions over with the client. \"I can only read the colour of his face every time I see him to realise what battles he goes through. I couldn't have made it without him,\" claims Glazer. He predicts that Dream Club is his last Guinness commercial and admits that if the film projects were there and rolled into production in the same way that his commercials and promos work has, he'd give up adverts all together. Last year he directed his first feature - Sexy Beast, a gangster film which garnered critical acclaim and managed to stand out from the crop of Brit gangster flicks around at the time. Glazer was, of course, unhappy with the film. \"I remember reading this Gore Vidal thing the other day and he said he was watching a film and it was like 40 commercials looking for a product. I thought: 'God forbid that I should be that.' The films I admire aren't that, and the films I want to make aren't that. But Sexy Beast, to an extent, was that.\" Glazer's fear is that he's not going to be able to make the transition into what he really wants to be and claims he'd rather drive a cab than do anything in a mediocre way. Is he just another commercials director with a craving for film credibility? \"To be honest with you, it's not a new thing at all,\" he says, citing directors like Ridley and Tony Scott, conceding that the work that ex-advert directors are producing is probably better and more influential than it used to be. One of the curses of being a perfectionist is never being able to see the wood for the trees - audiences, peers and judging panels enjoy something in Glazer's work which he remains unhappy about. Industry gongs such as his unprecedented two D&amp;AD gold arrows for That Advert go some way to ameliorating a feeling of anger at being left stranded in the commercials market, but the ability to get out and make work without any limitations is what really matters to Glazer, a freedom he's only really experienced in his music video work. \"If you're working with an artist who has the confidence to know what they're about, then it's you and them and that's it, the business takes care of itself because it's a better product ultimately, so they sell more albums and everyone's happy. As long as they do that it affords you choice and freedom.\" He believes he'll get this freedom with his next film. It's unclear which of the three projects he's currently working will make it, but the most interesting would be a collaboration with veteran French screenwriter Jean-Claude Carri\u00e8re (The Tin Drum, Belle de Jour). Glazer doesn't want to talk in detail about it, but at its simplest it's a personal project about a 10-year-old boy falling in love with a 35-year-old woman. It will, of course, be made with Glazer's near obsessional attention to detail. Something he feels he'll never get with commercials, a situation he's obviously wrestling with.",

Cinema is even less important - 20% of geeks haven't been to watch a movie in the past three months and 40% claim that they \"never go to the cinema these days\". Are geeks still big technology buffs? Geeks are not that ahead of the game when it comes to new gadgets. Just over a third claim to \"keep up with advances in technology\" and only slightly more have internet access at home. It seems their love of gadgets is hampered by income. \"I like to play around with gadgets, but don't really get the time these days. Money, I suppose, means that I can't buy new stuff when it comes out but by the time I can afford it something is else is out and I'll think 'yeah, I'll wait and buy that',\" is a typical observation.

      "body": "<p>There's a South African ad for an insurance company and it goes like this: a hospital cleaner shuffles into the intensive care unit. She's black. She looks round for somewhere to plug in her vacuum cleaner, and guess what happens next? It'll kill you. She unplugs the patient. </p> <p>As lights flash and sirens wail, white nurses rush in to resuscitate the patient and the cleaner sails blissfully off down the corridor. \"Expect the unexpected\" is the pay-off line. In Britain, the ad would be banned, but in South Africa it won an award. </p> <p>Channel 4 is showing some of these award-winning ads each night this week as part of the South Africa Celebrates festival. Ironically for a country trying to put its racist past behind it, the first thing that strikes you is how racist many of the ads are. </p> <p>Apartheid may have fallen apart in 1994, promising a new start for the country and an economic boom fuelled by the creation of a black middle class, but is this black middle class being served by advertising? The president may be black, but in adverts white businessmen still run the country, serviced by cleaners who live in happy-clappy townships. </p> <p>The plot for the typical township ad goes like this: poor black kids play cricket with cans, parents laughing in slow-mo on the porch. It all looks very expensive and tasteful, and is shot, naturally, in black and white. In fantasy township, there is no poverty.

      "bodyText": "There's a South African ad for an insurance company and it goes like this: a hospital cleaner shuffles into the intensive care unit. She's black. She looks round for somewhere to plug in her vacuum cleaner, and guess what happens next? It'll kill you. She unplugs the patient. As lights flash and sirens wail, white nurses rush in to resuscitate the patient and the cleaner sails blissfully off down the corridor. \"Expect the unexpected\" is the pay-off line. In Britain, the ad would be banned, but in South Africa it won an award. Channel 4 is showing some of these award-winning ads each night this week as part of the South Africa Celebrates festival. Ironically for a country trying to put its racist past behind it, the first thing that strikes you is how racist many of the ads are. Apartheid may have fallen apart in 1994, promising a new start for the country and an economic boom fuelled by the creation of a black middle class, but is this black middle class being served by advertising? The president may be black, but in adverts white businessmen still run the country, serviced by cleaners who live in happy-clappy townships. The plot for the typical township ad goes like this: poor black kids play cricket with cans, parents laughing in slow-mo on the porch. It all looks very expensive and tasteful, and is shot, naturally, in black and white. In fantasy township, there is no poverty. Instead, the experience of growing up without electricity or running water is sentimentalised into a Soweto version of the Hovis ad. It's no accident that the kids play cricket. Sport provides one of the few black/white crossovers in the new South Africa: an area relatively free from racial tension and thus perfect for advertisers.

      "bodyText": "MTV is hoping to cash in on text messaging mania by becoming the first broadcaster to introduce text messaging services across all of its channels. Since February viewers have been able to request tracks on many MTV channels by text message. The service has been so popular the broadcaster wants to extend it to all MTV channels. \"It wasn't expected to be as successful as it was, so now they're looking at integrating SMS into other shows,\" said a spokesman. Unlike the internet, text messaging does not drag viewers away from the TV. According to MTV figures, the service appears to be boosting ratings, with the number of viewers increasing from 295,000 to 500,000 per show. The 25,000 text messages received each show on average has prompted MTV to change its afternoon schedule to give it three interactive shows. These include the daily chart show and MTV Select, hosted by George Clooney's girlfriend, Lisa Snowdon, both of which allow for voting, requests and song dedications. MTV claims to be the only TV company using SMS for live shows, although other broadcasters have tested it. The BBC has said it is looking at developing SMS elements for its shows while Channel 5 ran a campaign for viewers to enter an SMS competition around the weekly \"blockbuster movie\", which dwarfed the internet side of the campaign sixfold. Last year Channel 4 did a basic news service for Big Brother by SMS, while BSkyB is also said to be looking at developing SMS strategies for programmes.",

By a coincidence that elicited groans from Labour MPs, the German chancellor's proposals are to be discussed by his party colleagues in Berlin next month on the day Mr Blair is due to visit the city for a meeting of the Party of European Socialists. Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \"We strongly disagree with Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, but at least he has the courage of his convictions. \"Tony Blair doesn't want to talk about his vision of the EU because he knows how out of touch Labour is on Europe with the mainstream majority of the British people.\" A report in today's edition of the news magazine, Der Spiegel, says that the draft envisages turning the unelected European commission into a government with wide-ranging powers.

      "bodyText": "China is to let the US inspect its spy plane on Hainan island, having completed its own \"investigation and collection of evidence\" in the month since the EP-3 was forced to land after a mid-air collision with a Chinese fighter jet. The concession will allow negotiations on the clash to move forward, but it comes as as US-China relations deteriorate in the wake of the US decision to sell more weapons to Taiwan. The US will be allowed to inspect the plane at Lingshui airport on Hainan\", the Chinese news agency continued, with out suggesting that the plane would be returned as the US has demanded. It said the US had agreed \"to consider making payments to China\", presumably for the loss of the Chinese fighter, whose dead pilot is being hailed as a national hero. \"The two sides will conduct another round of negotiations on the specific amount of the US payment and the items to be covered,\" it said. The US vice-president, Dick Cheney, said it was an \"encouraging sign, but denied that Washington had agreed to reimburse China for any costs other than those concerning the \"recovery of the aircraft\". \"We certainly have not offered any compensation other than the costs [of recovery]\", he said.\"They obviously got a good look at the aircraft - but I see it as an encouraging sign that they are willing to proceed.\" The Chinese parliament is discussing a law on \"national defence education\" in primary and secondary schools and colleges which will stress the humiliations suffered by China in the past and the continued existence of \"US hegemonism\". One MP has proposed creating a special day for national study on September 7, the 100th anniversary of the treaty which China was forced to sign after the failure of the Boxer Rebellion against the foreign settlements in China. Although the arms sales to Taiwan announced last week excluded the most sensitive items, such as the Aegis radar combat system, any moderating effect that might have had was offset by President Bush's tough remarks about defending the island in the event of an attack from the mainland. Senior Chinese officials who are committed to a long-term relationship with the US find the shift away from Washington's previous \"constructive ambiguity\" on Taiwan increasingly hard to explain. Another area of confrontation has emerged with China's demand that Washington should refuse to allow the Taiwanese president, Chen Shui-bian, to visit the US next month. It was revealed at the weekend that Taiwan's foreign minister, Tien Hung-mao, has left for the US to arrange Mr Chen's visit. While insisting on the right to use armed force in the last re sort if Taiwan finally rejects reunification, Beijing has made a new offer of talks with the offshore island. Wang Daohan, the Chinese official who arranged the 1992 understanding with Taiwan, says the mainland is willing to resume talks based upon that understanding, \"without [making] any new demands.\"",

      "bodyText": "Talks aimed at ending the conflict in Macedonia were in doubt yesterday after eight members of the security forces were killed in an ambush near the Kosovan border, and a further six injured. The attack on Saturday on a joint patrol of 16 soldiers and police officers was the most serious single incident since fighting erupted in February, and ended a month-long lull. It put a serious question against negotiations between the government and opposition parties for a new coalition which, it was thought, could pave the way for many of the reforms sought by the ethnic Albanian minority. Reports that the ambush victims' had been mutilated further reduced that prospect. The incident was discussed at an emergency cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon and the national security council, which encompasses the army, police, intelligence services and the presidents office, was due to decide last night what action to take. Officials said the patrol was ambushed near Vejce village, 12 miles north of Tetovo. \"They were hit by everything,\" said Nikola Dimitrov, security adviser to President Boris Trajkovski. \"They used hand grenades, rocket launchers and machine guns.\" He said the guerrilla's had gone out of their way to disfigure the corpses. \"It's unbelievable, and it's going to damage the political process. Now it will be so difficult to proceed.\" The Macedonian media blamed the National Liberation Army (NLA), whose commanders denied breaking the unofficial ceasefire that has been in place since March. The NLA's spokesman, Ali Ahmeti, told Reuters that his troops had not attacked, although they might have acted in self defence. Mr Trajkovski cancelled a planned visit to Romania to attend the cabinet meeting. He is due to fly to Washington today for talks with President Bush. Arben Xhafari, leader of the Democratic Albanian party, and a member of the government, condemned the ambush. \"I think it will endanger the progress of negotiations and will deepen the polarisation between Macedonians and Albanians,\" he said. Talks about a new government were due to conclude by the end of the week. Many Albanian politicians have expressed frustration at what they see as a lack of progress. Albanian parties want constitutional change, and more language and employment rights. The NLA says it has the same goals, but Saturday's ambush reinforced the view held by many majority politicians that the guerrillas merely want territory and are not interested in dialogue. \"The roots of this crisis are not in the system of the state - they want a state for themselves,\" Mr Dimitrov said.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'Anyone who says they're 'just a secretary' is making an excuse,\" says Robert Laird firmly. \"A few years ago secretaries passed on problems to managers - now PAs are key managers, and we deal with things ourselves.\" </p> <p>As Britain's top PA, Laird puts his finger on something that is quite revolutionary in office admin matters - that modern training and qualifications have begun to recognise the direct progression from secretary to a senior-management role. Laird is PA to Rae Angus, principal of Aberdeen College - which, with 35,000 students, 500 staff, and a budget of \u00a313m, is equivalent to a small town. </p> <p>Last week, Laird took the UK Top Secretary Award, comprehensively beating 1,500 others in the London chamber of commerce and industry (LCCIEB) examinations board executive secretary's diploma, and topping another 1,000 who entered the exams from 86 countries, barely stopping to collect five distinctions and two medals along the way. </p> <p>He was one of only five students, identified by superb \"raw\" marks across the five compulsory subjects, which had taken a year's study at an average 12 hours a week, who were called in to be grilled by the examinations board about their under standing of their roles as a secretary manager, and for their qualities of management, tact and diplomacy. </p> <p>In doing so, the board demonstrated admirable tact itself, backing up its tag of \"the world's most prestigious title\" - there are dozens of PA qualifications, certifications and awards, and dotted around the world are several that are suspect. </p> <p>\"Some 'secretary-of-the-year' awards tend to select winners on a subjective basis,\" was the careful observation from Dawn Postans at the LCCIEB. \"The Top Secretary Award is based on both objective aggregate performance and personal interview - it is the range of skills and experience which makes it the most demanding secretarial qualification.\" </p> <p>What exactly are today's key secretarial skills? Beside the obvious English for business, business administration, principles and practice of management, and transcription at 110/120 wpm, the examinations board introduced a fascinating practical test - each candidate watched a 25-minute video of a meeting, then had an hour and a half to produce an accurate record of it. </p> <p>\"This,\" observed the board quietly, \"is an exam which all managers could use!\" Such training, says the LCCI, now recognises that the PA is in a changing role. \"The secretary is still an 'organiser', but most now play a part in company decision-making, act as a sounding board for managers' ideas, and are expected to offer feedback. They analyse information, and advise on the most effective way to complete projects.\" </p> <p>And, as Candy Daniels, president of the American Secretaries, has notably observed: \"We are the first worker-group to test and master new office technology - so our status is information managers of the information age, the 'information central' of the digital office.\" </p> <p> Notably, the British award still uses the word \"secretary\", when the America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and some of the far eastern countries have gone over to \"administrative professionals\", or \"management assistants\", or, in America, just \"admins\". Together with the most advanced secretarial nation on the earth, the Brazilians, the examination board still uses the traditional title. </p> <p>\"To me, 'personal assistant' sums it up best,\" says Robert Laird, the first male PA to win the board's UK gold medal in 45 years. \"We must remember that we are a supporting role - but I can be fulfilled in it because I am recognised as part of the management team. And with this title, I get exemption from some sections of the Institute of Administrative Management diploma - this shows the direct route from secretarial work to management.\" </p> <p>But . . . a man? Gender equality is about breaking down stereotypes, such as the concept of the PA route to senior management, observes Laird, adding calmly: \"I'd have a problem working with any organisation that couldn't see this.\" </p> <p>There are several things employers don't see, said runner-up Clare Salt, who has just got a new job as PA to a director at Barclays Bank. \"I wanted to be a top PA, and this has given me the confidence of knowing that I really can do it - and we can do a lot more than our bosses know, particularly in IT. The PA is now the office helpdesk!\" </p> <p>With this progress, the gap between good PA and bad is getting wider, says Ann O'Riordan of Blackpool, Wyre and Fylde community trust, who took third place. \"My last qualification was more years ago than I'll tell anybody, but I thought I'd cracked it, and that I was a good secretary . . . well, this course made me rethink things I'd been doing for years. </p> <p>\"There's a bigger difference today between a great secretary, a good one, and an indifferent one - so heaven help the boss who has a poor one!\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "'Anyone who says they're 'just a secretary' is making an excuse,\" says Robert Laird firmly. \"A few years ago secretaries passed on problems to managers - now PAs are key managers, and we deal with things ourselves.\" As Britain's top PA, Laird puts his finger on something that is quite revolutionary in office admin matters - that modern training and qualifications have begun to recognise the direct progression from secretary to a senior-management role. Laird is PA to Rae Angus, principal of Aberdeen College - which, with 35,000 students, 500 staff, and a budget of \u00a313m, is equivalent to a small town. Last week, Laird took the UK Top Secretary Award, comprehensively beating 1,500 others in the London chamber of commerce and industry (LCCIEB) examinations board executive secretary's diploma, and topping another 1,000 who entered the exams from 86 countries, barely stopping to collect five distinctions and two medals along the way. He was one of only five students, identified by superb \"raw\" marks across the five compulsory subjects, which had taken a year's study at an average 12 hours a week, who were called in to be grilled by the examinations board about their under standing of their roles as a secretary manager, and for their qualities of management, tact and diplomacy. In doing so, the board demonstrated admirable tact itself, backing up its tag of \"the world's most prestigious title\" - there are dozens of PA qualifications, certifications and awards, and dotted around the world are several that are suspect. \"Some 'secretary-of-the-year' awards tend to select winners on a subjective basis,\" was the careful observation from Dawn Postans at the LCCIEB. \"The Top Secretary Award is based on both objective aggregate performance and personal interview - it is the range of skills and experience which makes it the most demanding secretarial qualification.\" What exactly are today's key secretarial skills? Beside the obvious English for business, business administration, principles and practice of management, and transcription at 110/120 wpm, the examinations board introduced a fascinating practical test - each candidate watched a 25-minute video of a meeting, then had an hour and a half to produce an accurate record of it. \"This,\" observed the board quietly, \"is an exam which all managers could use!\" Such training, says the LCCI, now recognises that the PA is in a changing role. \"The secretary is still an 'organiser', but most now play a part in company decision-making, act as a sounding board for managers' ideas, and are expected to offer feedback. They analyse information, and advise on the most effective way to complete projects.\" And, as Candy Daniels, president of the American Secretaries, has notably observed: \"We are the first worker-group to test and master new office technology - so our status is information managers of the information age, the 'information central' of the digital office.\" Notably, the British award still uses the word \"secretary\", when the America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and some of the far eastern countries have gone over to \"administrative professionals\", or \"management assistants\", or, in America, just \"admins\". Together with the most advanced secretarial nation on the earth, the Brazilians, the examination board still uses the traditional title. \"To me, 'personal assistant' sums it up best,\" says Robert Laird, the first male PA to win the board's UK gold medal in 45 years. \"We must remember that we are a supporting role - but I can be fulfilled in it because I am recognised as part of the management team. And with this title, I get exemption from some sections of the Institute of Administrative Management diploma - this shows the direct route from secretarial work to management.\" But . . . a man? Gender equality is about breaking down stereotypes, such as the concept of the PA route to senior management, observes Laird, adding calmly: \"I'd have a problem working with any organisation that couldn't see this.\" There are several things employers don't see, said runner-up Clare Salt, who has just got a new job as PA to a director at Barclays Bank. \"I wanted to be a top PA, and this has given me the confidence of knowing that I really can do it - and we can do a lot more than our bosses know, particularly in IT. The PA is now the office helpdesk!\" With this progress, the gap between good PA and bad is getting wider, says Ann O'Riordan of Blackpool, Wyre and Fylde community trust, who took third place. \"My last qualification was more years ago than I'll tell anybody, but I thought I'd cracked it, and that I was a good secretary . . . well, this course made me rethink things I'd been doing for years. \"There's a bigger difference today between a great secretary, a good one, and an indifferent one - so heaven help the boss who has a poor one!\"",

This time last year the figure was 60%. </p> <p>It is difficult to account for the falling off. Maine-Tucker's spokespeople have no pat answers, although they suggest that when secretaries use the internet to search for jobs they prefer the \"clicks and mortar\" sites - that is websites attached to well-established companies. Maine-Tucker reports that use of its own website is on the increase. </p> <p>Although many recruitment companies distance themselves from their online activities by giving their websites distinct names, a well-known name is reassuring. The wild frontier image of the web does not help the spread of internet commerce.

      "bodyText": "It is not just investors who have lost faith in dot.com industries. It seems that internet users are beginning to go cold on the medium as well. The annual salary survey from secretarial consultancy Maine-Tucker reports that 26% of its candidates regularly use the internet to search for jobs. This time last year the figure was 60%. It is difficult to account for the falling off. Maine-Tucker's spokespeople have no pat answers, although they suggest that when secretaries use the internet to search for jobs they prefer the \"clicks and mortar\" sites - that is websites attached to well-established companies. Maine-Tucker reports that use of its own website is on the increase. Although many recruitment companies distance themselves from their online activities by giving their websites distinct names, a well-known name is reassuring. The wild frontier image of the web does not help the spread of internet commerce. There have been rumours of wildcat agencies pirating other agencies' jobs, or even pooling candidates' CVs so that while you are quietly planning to move on, your employer could download your CV from a site you may not even be aware of.

Mr Regan's lawyer, Ian Burton, defending his client on charges of stealing \u00a32.4m, has already written to the likes of Michael Foot, the head of banking regulation at the financial services authority, and UBS corporate financier Brian Keelan, requesting information. Carl Cushnie, founder of trade finance house Versailles which collapsed last year, is suing his former finance director, Frederick Clough, for \u00a312m allegedly missing from Mr Cushnie's private investment company. Scottish Power is contemplating a \u00a32bn takeover of Oregon utility Portland General in a move that would bolster its US west coast operations. Sunday Business British Telecom plans to raise up to \u00a310bn through its expected rights issue - twice the level expected. The company is said to be encouraged by growing investor confidence that it is serious about undertaking painful organisational change. The government is unable to guarantee that next year's football World Cup will be shown live on terrestrial TV, despite the tournament being listed as a \"crown jewel\" event which must be made available to free-to-air broadcasters. Kirch, the German media group which owns the rights to the tournament, has said it will sell the British rights to the highest bidder. Railtrack is under pressure to scrap its end-of-year dividend payment to shareholders when final figures are released in a month's time. Sunday Times Angus Monro, ousted as chief executive of discount stores group Matalan, has told friends that he was ambushed at a board meeting and \"astonished\" at his sudden dismissal. Research from the investment banking wing of HSBC suggests NTL, the country's biggest cable company, would have run out of money within two months but for a \u00a3270m cash injection from America's GE Capital on Friday. PPL Therapeutics, the biotech firm behind Dolly the Sheep, is planning a fresh attempt to raise money in the City after abandoning a \u00a345m share offer earlier this month. Sunday Telegraph Arena Leisure, the racecourse group, is expected to make an \u00a380m rights issue this week to help fund its participation in the Go Racing consortium, which has won the television rights to British horse racing in a \u00a3400m deal. Engineering group BBA has put its materials technology division, which counts nappy liners among its products, up for sale with a \u00a31bn price tag. The company plans to focus on aviation services.

The requests were revealed yesterday by Pekka Haavisto, head of the Balkans depleted uranium assessment team, who has been asked to take on the job His team has just completed an investigation for the UN Environment Programme of the nine tonnes of depleted uranium used in the Nato assault on Serbian forces in Kosovo. The mineral is used to reinforce the tips of armour-piercing munitions. In the Gulf war, 350 tonnes were used in attacks on Iraqi armour, but no independent study of its dangers has ever been made, partly because of Nato resistance. Both Iraq and Kuwait have a potentially deadly problem of uncleared DU ammunition. Iraq asked the UN secretary general Kofi Annan to help, and Kuwait approached the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. US and British veterans of the war to expel Iraq from Kuwait suspect that depleted uranium is the cause of Gulf war syndrome, the unexplained illnesses suffered by many of those who served in the conflict. Iraq has blamed it for a rash of childhood cancers. The team's findings in Kosovo have gone a long way to dispel fears that the mildly radioactive ammunition will have a long-term effect on the health of local people. But in the Gulf it may be a different story. The hot, dry climate and the volume of ammunition used may mean there is a far greater and continuing hazard.

      "bodyText": "The South African government's investigation of three leading politicians alleged to be plotting against President Thabo Mbeki is based on statements made to the police by a disgraced ANC youth leader who is facing prosecution on dozens of fraud charges. The ANC plans to meet all three - the party's former secretary general Cyril Ramaphosa and two former provincial premiers, Mathews Phosa and Tokyo Sexwale - this week. It has failed to persuade them to endorse the investigation in the hope of defusing the crisis. The man responsible for the allegations is James Nkambule, 29, a formerly influential ANC activist who was suspended from the party as a \"factionalist\". He has been charged with 77 offences of theft and fraud by allegedly siphoning millions of rand from state coffers using front companies. He admits taking the money but says it was done to pay for ANC election campaigns. Mr Nkambule has signed two affidavits which attempt to implicate the three men under investigation and a number of other senior ANC politicians, including the deputy president, Jacob Zuma, and the former defence minister Joe Modise, in a bizarre string of alleged crimes. The documents outline a convoluted \"plot\" which begins with a covert arms shipment on behalf of some ANC leaders to Mozambique nine years ago. According to Mr Nkambule's signed statement to the police a week ago, the former Communist party leader Chris Hani discovered that other ANC officials were profiting from the weapons deal and threatened to expose them. He was then murdered by white rightwingers who were allegedly \"influenced\" by Mr Mbeki because he supposedly wanted to make sure Hani did not challenge him for the leadership of the ANC. Mr Nkambule claims that the three men under investigation saw an affidavit from Janus Walus, a Polish anti-communist exile convicted of murdering Hani, which said Mr Mbeki had a role in the killing. Mr Nkambule says they planned to use the information to topple the president by \"briefing\" ambassadors of other African states and the foreign press. The source of the allegations will be a further embarrassment to the government, which has so far failed to shake off the accusation that the investigation is a witch-hunt against Mr Mbeki's potential rivals for leadership of the ANC. Nelson Mandela gave his backing to Mr Mbeki during a visit to London yesterday.",

      "body": "<p>Yasser Arafat often describes his struggle as a \"long march\" to the \"spires and minarets\" of Jerusalem, capital of his Palestinian state-to-be. \"And I hope that the next time you see me,\" he said, \"will be in my mother's house.\" It was next to the Wailing Wall, he explained; and it had only been partly destroyed when the Israelis demolished the ancient Mograbi quarter, immediately after their conquest of East Jerusalem in 1967.</p> <p>Here in Ramallah he is as physically close to his goal as he can get, a mere 10 minutes by car. But whether, politically, this really is his last way-station on the road to Jerusalem depends on the outcome of the intifada.</p> <p>At the moment, like all the town's inhabitants, he is under siege. He received me in the Muqata'a, or district headquarters, from which the British, Jordanians and then Israelis had formerly administered the town.</p> <p>The night before, it had come under fire, another of those now almost banal intrusions of warfare into lives which have many outward aspects of normality. Ramallah is beset by Israeli settlements. The exchanges between them and the Palestinian Shabiba, or \"youth\", have taken on a routine pattern. Sometimes the Shabiba start them, with their ineffectual Kalashnikovs, sometimes the settlers or Israeli army, with much heavier weapons, including tanks. On this occasion, locals said, it was the latter. From the settlement of Psagot, quite out of the blue, they shot and wounded a 12-year-old boy in the Hashimiyah school playground, 300 yards or so away. The Muqata'a, said an Arafat aide, was hit several times by machine gun fire.</p> <p>Intensifying the sense of siege, for Mr Arafat, is the difficulty of movement. His private helicopter has been grounded since the former prime minister Ehud Barak \"pushed his forces into our towns and cities on September 28\". Now he has to rely on a Jordanian helicopter. And simply to get to Gaza, the other segment of his domain now almost entirely cut off from the West Bank, he has to go first to Amman, take a flight to al-Arish, and then go by road through dangerous, settler territory to his local headquarters.</p> <p>I first met the president, as he now styles himself, in Jordan's Ghor valley in 1968, shortly after his guerrilla movement had emerged, in an aura of heroism and great expectations, from the clandestinity that Israel and hostile Arab governments had imposed on it. At the time, as the mere \"spokesman\" of the collectively led Fatah organisation, his rhetoric was fiery and his objectives uncompromising: the complete liberation of Palestine, and by armed struggle alone.</p> <p>It was apparently owing to this long association that he agreed to be interviewed. Nonetheless it came as a surprise to me, all the more so in that, as a result of my last visit to the occupied territories - Gaza 1997 - when I had written about the corruptions of the Palestinian Authority, he had instructed his representative in London to sue me in the British courts. But Mr Arafat was ever a man of reconciliations. He is about to consummate a far more spectacular one, to go to Damascus to see Bashar Assad, son of the ruler he used to describe, in some of his darkest hours, as the co-conspirator, against the Palestinian cause, of Israel itself.</p> <p>He began this interview with the paradoxical assertion that \"I am not giving interviews.\" So what was this, then? \"Just a chat.\" Furthermore, I observed, he hardly ever addresses his people.\"Yes\", he conceded , \"I speak little,\" and turning to his chef de cabinet, Ahmad Abdul Rahman, he said: \"I leave it to my mass media experts, they are better at it than me.\"</p> <p>He is in relaxed and buoyant mood, confident, some of his entourage say, that he is at least holding his own in the great trial of strength and stamina now under way. He must also know that, though still heavily criticised for the manifold flaws of his administration, he has regained much popularity, here and in the Arab world at large, simply for standing firm as the leader of a patriotic struggle.</p> <p>He is also, he says, in good health. Even as long ago as his last two great sieges - the Israeli one of Beirut 1982 , the Syrian one of Tripoli 1983 - he was known to his followers as the Khityar, the \"old man\". Now, at 72, the Khityar shows his age. But there is no sign of mental decay, and even the celebrated trembling lips - not the symptom, apparently, of any serious condition - tremble less than they used to.</p> <p><b> Taciturn</b><br></p> <p>This taciturnity is widely interpreted as the deliberate strategy it clearly is. He just does not want to elaborate on the nature of the intifada. Is it violent - violence being banned under the Oslo accords - or non-violent? Armed struggle or peaceable mass action? Spontaneous, or subject to his control? Confined to the occupied territories or deliberately exported to Israel proper? Clearly, it contains all these elements. But you would be hard pressed to get him to explain his part in them. It is not his business, he insists, but Israel's.</p> <p>For Mr Sharon it was who started it all. He had been so alarmed, he said, at the rightwing leader's plan, last September, to visit the Aqsa compound that he and several aides had visited Mr Barak at his home the night before to warn him of the likely consequences. \"Unfortunately, he did not follow my advice. You know what happened the next day: they opened fire on those who were praying. That is what made the intifada and the resistance of our people.\"</p> <p>So would the intifada go on? \"Before asking me, you must ask the Israelis whether they will go on with their military escalation.\" But they accuse you of going back to armed struggle? \"It seems,\" he said with heavy irony, \"that it is I who sends helicopters, tanks, and armoured cars to seal all Israeli cities... Is it I who uses uranium, and gas bombs? I who closes the passages to Jordan and Gaza? We have funerals every day. Who can control a people who have funerals every day?\" But until now, he insisted, \"I have not given any order to open fire. And they know that. Our policemen and soldiers have not been involved till now.\" So it was individual, spontaneous acts? \"Mainly. And self-defence against the settlers.\"</p> <p>It reminded him, despite the much lesser scale, of the 1982 siege of Beirut, except that in Beirut \"we didn't have these settlers, who commit their crimes under the control and protection of the Israeli army - attacking our towns and villages and uprooting trees, including even olive trees that go back to Roman times.\" So if they stopped causing funerals every day, you could tell your people to stop? \"Definitely. But they also have to follow up the agreement.\" That is to say, to return to the peace process where it had been left off, not at last July's Camp David summit, but at the Taba talks held on the eve of the Israeli elections.</p> <p>At those, he said, the two sides had come closer than ever to an agreement. He repudiated the Israelis' contention that it was he who had caused the peace process to collapse, by rejecting the \"most generous offer\" Israel ever made, an offer measured - in its territorial dimension - as 96%, or thereabouts, of the occupied territories. If there was a generous offer, he said, it was the Palestinians', with their renunciation of 78% of their original homeland.</p> <p>None the less, at Taba, the Israelis had yielded far more than ever before - far more than at Camp David. \"For the first time they agreed to give up 80% of the settlements. For those, along the frontier, that would not be removed, there would be a land swap.\" But could he now make any headway with a man like Mr Sharon, whose officially stated idea of territorial compromise is that the Palestinians should be content with 42% of their 22%, who refuses to shake hands with a \"liar and a murderer\", and who - said Mr Arafat himself - had tried to assassinate him 13 times during the siege of Beirut alone? His aides think not.</p> <p>But Mr Arafat is discretion itself: \"I respect anyone the Israelis elect, Rabin, Peres, Netanyahu, Barak and now Sharon.\" Besides, \"I don\"t think he will try to kill me; he is now the first man in Israel - and I have a hotline to him.\" A hotline? \"Yes, Omri is my hotline\" - Sharon's son, now becoming a regular visitor to the Muqata'a.</p> <p>It would seem from such methods of communication that you are \"Arabising\" the Israelis? \"But they are Arabs,\" he shot back, calculating that 70% of them are of Middle East origin.</p> <p>And the fact was that Mr Sharon was beginning to falter. That is the interpretation he and his aides put on a recent, inglorious operation in Gaza. The Israeli army had been obliged to retreat from its punitive foray into Area A, that portion of the occupied territories, still very small, over which the Palestinian Authority has exclusive control. The important thing here, he said, was that President George Bush and the Europeans had told Mr Sharon to stop.</p> <p>So you believe that international intervention is indispensable? \"This is what happened all over the world, in Bosnia, in Kosovo.\" Some Israelis believe that you will do anything, even engineer another massacre, another Sabra and Shatila, to bring that about? \"It has been done already - 25,000 people wounded. And what about all that destruction to houses, installations, schools, mosques and churches; even the synagogue of the Samaritans in Nablus has been bombed.\"</p> <p>Was it not possible, if things got worse, that, instead of completing his \"long march\" to Jerusalem, he would be captured and put on a plane to Tunis, his former headquarters in exile, as some Israelis were urging? \"I will return. I have my ways, you know. I always used to come here secretly. This is my land. Here I shall die.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Israelis and Palestinians agreed in principle yesterday to a ceasefire aimed at ending seven months of bloodshed. But no date has been set and disagreement remains on the specific details, such as how long it will last. The Israelis want the trial ceasefire, which they see as a test of whether the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, can be trusted, to last up to eight weeks. The Palestinians have proposed four weeks. More significantly, major differences remain over what should happen after a ceasefire is in place. The diplomatic flurry, the most intensive since Ariel Sharon, a rightwinger, became Israeli prime minister two months ago, was undermined by a weekend of violence that left two Palestinians and an Israeli soldier dead. The ceasefire arrangement was contained in a joint Jordanian-Egyptian peace plan put forward a month ago and supported by the Palestinians. The Israeli foreign minister, Shimon Peres, initially rejected it but yesterday edged towards an agreement. He flew to Cairo to meet the Egyptian foreign minister, Hosni Mubarak, and then to Jordan to meet King Abdullah. Mr Mubarak said afterwards that Israel and the Palestinian Authority had reached an understanding on a ceasefire. An Israeli official travelling with Mr Peres confirmed this: \"It is not a breakthrough but there are reasons not to be pessimistic. It has been a good day.\" Under the Jordanian-Egyptian plan, in return for Palestinians ending attacks, Israel would lift its blockade that has brought economic life in the West Bank and Gaza Strip almost to a standstill. In an apparent goodwill gesture, Mr Peres yesterday lifted a ban on Palestinians working within Israel proper. The negotiations are taking place in spite of Mr Sharon having made an election pledge not to talk to Palestinians until violence ended. Mr Peres's response to the plan was relayed by Cairo and Amman to the Palestinians, who will give a response to Mr Peres on his return to Israel on Thursday from talks in Washington. The initial Palestinian response was not positive. Under the Jordanian-Egyptian plan, the ceasefire would be followed by a resumption of negotiations based on US proposals put on the table at Taba early this year aimed at resolving Israeli-Palestinian differences over borders, the status of Jerusalem and the future of Palestinian refugees. Mr Peres said yesterday: \"There are still issues that we have to clarify and I don't want to claim that everything is OK.\" Mr Peres rejected the plan to resume with the Taba proposals. He favours a more limited peace settlement. A Palestinian shot dead in Bethlehem on Saturday was buried yesterday. In a separate incident, an Israeli soldier was killed the same day.

The arrival of the bones of St Therese, the Little Flower, for a 75-day trip to towns and cities across Ireland has provoked remarkable religious fervour in a predominantly Catholic, but increasingly secular, country. The Catholic church in Ireland has been battered by scandals over the past decade. Church attendance is dropping, fewer young men are taking up the priesthood and recent surveys have shown fewer than a quarter of Catholics agree with the strict teachings of the church on moral matters. Yet if the first few weeks are indicative of the whole trip, more than 2m people will see the relics, as many as turned out to see Pope John Paul II on his 1979 visit. A 75,000-strong crowd came to see Bishop Brendan Comiskey bless the 400lb gold and silver casket containing the relics after it was carried ashore at Rosslare, Co Wexford, by a special ceremonial unit of the Irish army on Easter Sunday. The casket is travelling to a different church every day in a six-tonne Mercedes Sprinter, which the clergy have dubbed the Theresemobile, donated by a retired regimental sergeant major, Pat Sweeny. \"She is a crowd-puller, no doubt,\" said Father Linus Ryan, the Carmelite priest co-ordinating the visit. \"The casket arrives at a location, rests in a church for the afternoon and we have huge queues, of half to three-quarters of a mile long, to pay their respects. \"The atmosphere is one of quiet reverence.

She almost died from a kidney infection when she was 10 but claimed she was cured by a vision of the Virgin Mary. At 15, she entered a Carmelite convent where she lived in simplicity until her death from tuberculosis at 24 in 1897. Her autobiography, Story of a Soul, was published a year later. Translated into 50 languages, it is one of the best-read Christian books. Therese was canonised in 1925, and in 1997 the present Pope declared her a Doctor of the Church, only the third woman to be given this title. Several people who visited her grave in Lisieux were allegedly healed of ailments and it is said when her body was exhumed to look for the evidence necessary to canonise her, the area was filled with the scent of roses for months. Father Ryan said: \"The healings are well documented in the church archives.

      "bodyText": "A couple were abducted in their car at knifepoint yesterday by a robber who threatened to inject them with a syringe filled with HIV-infected blood, before forcing them to drive 40 miles to a cashpoint. The ordeal began near Taunton, Somerset, when a man climbed into the back of their Mercedes after they stopped at traffic lights on a slip road from the M5, as they headed home to Dorchester, Dorset, at about 1am, police said. The pair were threatened with the syringe, which the robber claimed held HIV positive blood, and ordered to drive south. They drove to a Tesco superstore just off the M5 and were told to withdraw \u00a31,000 from a cash dispenser. As the male driver got out to do so, his wife escaped from the car. The robber then drove the vehicle away. It was later found burned out, near Teignmouth, Devon. The couple, who were found \"in a state of fright having been subjected to abduction and robbery\", were treated in hospital for bruising and minor cuts, the police said. A 38-year-old man and a woman aged 37 were arrested in Newton Abbot, Devon, in connection with the incident. They were being questioned in Exeter last night. It is believed the attack may be linked to others in the west country over the past two weeks. Last Tuesday, a taxi driver in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, was twice locked in the boot of his car as a knife-wielding man first robbed him then directed him to his bank and used his cash card to withdraw \u00a3250. On April 19, a female taxi driver from Warminster, Wiltshire, suffered a two-hour ordeal as a passenger held a syringe to her throat, told her to drive to Poole, Dorset, then took her car along with her handbag and wages. Her car was found in Kinson, Dorset.",

The report recommended that prison should be a last resort for mothers of young children, and should be used only for those women convicted of the most serious offences who represent a danger to the community. They should be housed in small secure and semi-secure units with social services support, and access to the outside world under supervision.

      "body": "<p>William Hague tossed away a few votes recently with his hapless \"more Blair equals a foreign Britain\" speech. Did the Tories learn a lesson? Of course not; they're not the \"stupid party\" for nothing.</p> <p>Last week the retiring, if not shy, Tory MP John Townend took Hague's dim argument and sunk it into the gutter. Another Blair government, says pure, blue-blooded Townend in his five-minutes-of-fame speech, and we'll all be mongrels. Beg pardon? Mongrels, sir.</p> <p>Like many of us who are British-born, I am a mongrel and happy to be one. English and Irish, with a touch of Scottish and a jot of Basque. At school - RC and so doubtless pretty rum as well as decidedly left-footish to the right-marching Townend - many of the other boys were mongrels, too. Anglo-Irish, Anglo-Scots and Anglo-whaddayagot: Indians, Poles, Italians and others. The last seemed the luckiest mongrels of all because their mothers cooked so exceptionally well.</p> <p>As for mongrel dogs, those of us who have spent our lives in the company of thoroughbreds and mongrels know that, on most counts, mutts are the best. They are healthier, brighter, easier to train, loving and great fun to be with. Of course, all dogs were cross-bred at one time or other. No cross-breeding, no mongrels, no King Charles spaniels. The same holds for plants and flowers. The finely scented roses so loved by the British, especially I should imagine by retired Tory MPs, are floral mongrels bred into a new form of earthly delight.</p> <p>Britain's successes - cultural, technical and architectural - have often been a result of cross-breeding. Whichever way you turn. What is, say, the most British car of all? You might say Bristol, but Tony Crook's gloriously blimpish, hand-crafted chariots are powered by Chrysler V8 engines. American. So too is the wonderfully cranky Morgan with its timber chassis and Buick-based engine. Another Anglo-American hybrid. The most stylish Aston-Martins, the DB4 and James Bond DB5 were a fusion of British engineering and Italian styling (coachwork by Touring of Milan). Sir William Lyons based the shape of his show-stealing 1948 Jaguar XK120 on pre-war experimental BMWs and Alfa-Romeos. He wasn't stupid.</p> <p>Well, what about our great railway locomotives, eh? Johnny Foreigner couldn't hold a candle to Mallard, could he? Mallard? Fastest steam locomotive in the world - 126mph in 1938. Yes, but Mallard was only so fast because her designer, Sir Nigel Gresley, chief mechanical engineer of the London and North Eastern Railway, had incorporated the latest research of Andr\u00e9 Chapelon, genius of French steam and the greatest locomotive engineer of all. Gresley's other famous locomotive, Flying Scotsman, was modelled in part on the hugely successful K4 Pacific of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The best of our legendary locomotives were, in the best possible way, mongrels. All the best designers, because the brightest, have always garnered and edited ideas from around the world.</p> <p>As with cars and locomotives, so with architecture, fashion and music. Our medieval cathedrals, at their best, are inspired fusions, artistic junction boxes through which flow the ideas of Normans and locals. Later on, we stirred decorative designs - half-baked it's true - drawn from the architectural recipe books of Renaissance Italy into our Tudor palaces and country houses. The Palladian movement, led by Lord Burlington, was a cross-breeding of the peerless Tuscan farmhouse and Venetian church architecture of Andrea Palladio with English, Scottish and Anglo-Irish sensibilities.</p> <p>As for St Paul's Cathedral, even Hague and Townend must know that it's a resourceful cross-breed between Gothic planning and Baroque design, a brilliant compromise. They must surely hear and taste as well as see the success of cross-breeding through the centuries in Britain. Listen to how Handel, a German, influenced British music when he came to live and compose in London.

      "bodyText": "William Hague tossed away a few votes recently with his hapless \"more Blair equals a foreign Britain\" speech. Did the Tories learn a lesson? Of course not; they're not the \"stupid party\" for nothing. Last week the retiring, if not shy, Tory MP John Townend took Hague's dim argument and sunk it into the gutter. Another Blair government, says pure, blue-blooded Townend in his five-minutes-of-fame speech, and we'll all be mongrels. Beg pardon? Mongrels, sir. Like many of us who are British-born, I am a mongrel and happy to be one. English and Irish, with a touch of Scottish and a jot of Basque. At school - RC and so doubtless pretty rum as well as decidedly left-footish to the right-marching Townend - many of the other boys were mongrels, too. Anglo-Irish, Anglo-Scots and Anglo-whaddayagot: Indians, Poles, Italians and others. The last seemed the luckiest mongrels of all because their mothers cooked so exceptionally well. As for mongrel dogs, those of us who have spent our lives in the company of thoroughbreds and mongrels know that, on most counts, mutts are the best. They are healthier, brighter, easier to train, loving and great fun to be with. Of course, all dogs were cross-bred at one time or other. No cross-breeding, no mongrels, no King Charles spaniels. The same holds for plants and flowers. The finely scented roses so loved by the British, especially I should imagine by retired Tory MPs, are floral mongrels bred into a new form of earthly delight. Britain's successes - cultural, technical and architectural - have often been a result of cross-breeding. Whichever way you turn. What is, say, the most British car of all? You might say Bristol, but Tony Crook's gloriously blimpish, hand-crafted chariots are powered by Chrysler V8 engines. American. So too is the wonderfully cranky Morgan with its timber chassis and Buick-based engine. Another Anglo-American hybrid. The most stylish Aston-Martins, the DB4 and James Bond DB5 were a fusion of British engineering and Italian styling (coachwork by Touring of Milan). Sir William Lyons based the shape of his show-stealing 1948 Jaguar XK120 on pre-war experimental BMWs and Alfa-Romeos. He wasn't stupid. Well, what about our great railway locomotives, eh? Johnny Foreigner couldn't hold a candle to Mallard, could he? Mallard? Fastest steam locomotive in the world - 126mph in 1938. Yes, but Mallard was only so fast because her designer, Sir Nigel Gresley, chief mechanical engineer of the London and North Eastern Railway, had incorporated the latest research of Andr\u00e9 Chapelon, genius of French steam and the greatest locomotive engineer of all. Gresley's other famous locomotive, Flying Scotsman, was modelled in part on the hugely successful K4 Pacific of the Pennsylvania Railroad. The best of our legendary locomotives were, in the best possible way, mongrels. All the best designers, because the brightest, have always garnered and edited ideas from around the world. As with cars and locomotives, so with architecture, fashion and music. Our medieval cathedrals, at their best, are inspired fusions, artistic junction boxes through which flow the ideas of Normans and locals. Later on, we stirred decorative designs - half-baked it's true - drawn from the architectural recipe books of Renaissance Italy into our Tudor palaces and country houses. The Palladian movement, led by Lord Burlington, was a cross-breeding of the peerless Tuscan farmhouse and Venetian church architecture of Andrea Palladio with English, Scottish and Anglo-Irish sensibilities. As for St Paul's Cathedral, even Hague and Townend must know that it's a resourceful cross-breed between Gothic planning and Baroque design, a brilliant compromise. They must surely hear and taste as well as see the success of cross-breeding through the centuries in Britain. Listen to how Handel, a German, influenced British music when he came to live and compose in London. See how successful Jimi Hendrix became when, through the agency of Chas Chandler, his Geordie manager, he fused American blues with British pop. Eat chicken tikka masala, spaghetti bolognese (as we know it), King Edward potatoes, Jersey tomatoes or Cadbury's chocolate (all American in origin) tucked up in your pyjamas safe inside your bungalow (Anglo-Indian slumberwear and home), and you're snuggled quite happily in a mongrel culture. Townend and his type might best be put into the care of Battersea Dogs' Home for the next few months in exchange for cross-breeds that need good homes.

      "body": "<p>One of the social exclusion unit's big ideas for regeneration is now becoming a reality. Neighbourhood managers are emerging from the job pages on to the streets. But how will they survive once this not-so-new idea loses its gloss?</p> <p>In principle, people have very little problem with the notion of neighbourhood management, and its fundamental premise is a simple one: there's a lot of money already going into deprived neighbourhoods, it needs to be used better. Much of the government's neighbourhood renewal agenda has been all about this anyway. </p> <p>The government is already trying out - or intends to try out - this idea through the 39 New Deal for Communities (NDC) pathfinders that are at various stages of approval or execution. The neighbourhood management brief here will be to sustain the benefits of 10 years' investment that the NDC schemes will bring. </p> <p>But another pathfinder programme for neighbourhood management proper ended its first stage bidding round last week. Eighty-three local authority districts were eligible to submit one bid each for this programme, but only 15 will be approved at the finishing line in December 2001. </p> <p>This means we can at least be reasonably sure that the bids currently being considered by the DETR (Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions) will result in 15 job adverts for neighbourhood managers by January 2002. A meagre number though this is, we are promised at least another 15 neighbourhood management schemes at some point in the future. </p> <p>Each of these partnerships will be eligible to a maximum of \u00a34.3m over seven years from the government. This, of course, is a lot less than the \u00a350m or more that is (or will be) available to the 39 NDC partnerships - 22 of which were announced today.</p> <p>An interesting research exercise for the future will be comparing the two pathfinder programmes. Which approach gets better outcomes - the one with a lot of money thrown at it, or the one with very little? Because this goes to the centre of the government's neighbourhood renewal, and even their sustainable development agenda. How do you make better use of what you've got, and get more for less? Getting this - and much more - from the neighbourhood agenda will depend heavily on the new animal called the neighbourhood manager. </p> <p>But who are these people, and which discipline are they coming from? What are they going to be doing? And how are they going to be equipped to work from and for the neighbourhood with the health authorities, local authorities and police who the new managers will want money and power from? Whichever way it is looked at, there needs to be a shift of power from other places - local authorities in particular, but not exclusively - to get neighbourhood managers the pound for pound weight they're going to need. </p> <p>Naturally the housing sector is staking their claim to the new neighbourhood management mantle. Various job adverts have emerged from the housing association and local authority sectors with neighbourhood prefixed to the job title, which is a start of sorts. </p> <p>Other disciplines such as town centre management, and more tenuously, the education and health professions might be able to offer people. But that is part of the problem: there are not many people out there who can obviously do the job, particularly when the skills and knowledge needed for this new model profession are currently less than clear. </p> <p>Handily, the recent DETR neighbourhood management guidance gives some clues with a matrix of the skills and knowledge required. And the recent action plan highlights the need for a learning and development strategy that the government is committed to delivering, via the new DETR-based Neighbourhood Renewal Unit. </p> <p>But if these neighbourhood managers are to be anything, they will be brokers or intermediaries (depending on your preference), and will need to be patient with it. Because they will be spending much time persuading local service providers to deliver services that suit the needs of local people rather than the demands of the \"clients\" who commission services, but who may be a little removed from the reality of the service delivery process itself. They'll also be spending a fair bit of time managing local people's expectations of the new agenda that is very bottom-up and community-focused, or at least the rhetoric is. </p> <p>Much as we would like neighbourhood managers to be \"in charge\" of local resources, in the short term, we're looking at evolutionary step-change. Criticism has repeatedly been levelled at local authorities for not being \"joined up\" and strategic enough in their work, but the criticism should be spread a lot further if these rather easy criticisms are to be fair ones. Other players will have to look at their work also, and housing associations are not exempt. And how the education and health money will filter down to the neighbourhood level can only be speculated on.</p> <p>But these two issues are interesting in their own right. The government has recently announced proposals to reduce bureaucracy and administration in the health service and to re-allocate saved money to frontline services provided by primary health groups. The Conservatives, in the meantime, have long been talking about abolishing local education authorities and giving a saved \u00a3500+ per pupil to school heads. And who would bet against New Labour lifting this idea for themselves? </p> <p>Cutting red tape and bureaucracy, and squeezing resources from the ivory towers to the frontline will always strike a chord with politicians and get a headline. What will be difficult for neighbourhood managers will be marshalling these resources to local priorities. The new local strategic partnerships have a clear remit to ensure neighbourhood managers get the support they need, and how they work with local authorities will be crucial on this point. </p> <p>But one of the problems that gets little coverage is the heavy cost of across-the-board local management approaches. Two local authorities in London - Tower Hamlets and Islington - tried out neighbourhood approaches to service delivery. Both approaches have their defenders and detractors, but they would probably both agree that the approach is commonly expensive. Economies of scale, successful and sustainable outcomes will hopefully result from future approaches to neighbourhood management, but the short-term bottom line cash cost will still count in many people's minds. </p> <p>And this is why the neighbourhood management agenda is potentially a threat to many local service providers, in a way that the regional agenda is a threat to local authorities. Duplication of roles is simply not sustainable and will need to be resolved in the fullness of time. And if it means more money, more expertise, more management at the frontline, just who will - or should - be standing in front of the neighbourhood manager, instead of behind them? </p> <p>\u0095 Aaron Cahill is regeneration policy officer at the National Housing Federation</p>",

The government is already trying out - or intends to try out - this idea through the 39 New Deal for Communities (NDC) pathfinders that are at various stages of approval or execution. The neighbourhood management brief here will be to sustain the benefits of 10 years' investment that the NDC schemes will bring. But another pathfinder programme for neighbourhood management proper ended its first stage bidding round last week. Eighty-three local authority districts were eligible to submit one bid each for this programme, but only 15 will be approved at the finishing line in December 2001. This means we can at least be reasonably sure that the bids currently being considered by the DETR (Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions) will result in 15 job adverts for neighbourhood managers by January 2002. A meagre number though this is, we are promised at least another 15 neighbourhood management schemes at some point in the future. Each of these partnerships will be eligible to a maximum of \u00a34.3m over seven years from the government. This, of course, is a lot less than the \u00a350m or more that is (or will be) available to the 39 NDC partnerships - 22 of which were announced today. An interesting research exercise for the future will be comparing the two pathfinder programmes. Which approach gets better outcomes - the one with a lot of money thrown at it, or the one with very little? Because this goes to the centre of the government's neighbourhood renewal, and even their sustainable development agenda. How do you make better use of what you've got, and get more for less? Getting this - and much more - from the neighbourhood agenda will depend heavily on the new animal called the neighbourhood manager. But who are these people, and which discipline are they coming from? What are they going to be doing? And how are they going to be equipped to work from and for the neighbourhood with the health authorities, local authorities and police who the new managers will want money and power from? Whichever way it is looked at, there needs to be a shift of power from other places - local authorities in particular, but not exclusively - to get neighbourhood managers the pound for pound weight they're going to need. Naturally the housing sector is staking their claim to the new neighbourhood management mantle. Various job adverts have emerged from the housing association and local authority sectors with neighbourhood prefixed to the job title, which is a start of sorts. Other disciplines such as town centre management, and more tenuously, the education and health professions might be able to offer people. But that is part of the problem: there are not many people out there who can obviously do the job, particularly when the skills and knowledge needed for this new model profession are currently less than clear. Handily, the recent DETR neighbourhood management guidance gives some clues with a matrix of the skills and knowledge required. And the recent action plan highlights the need for a learning and development strategy that the government is committed to delivering, via the new DETR-based Neighbourhood Renewal Unit. But if these neighbourhood managers are to be anything, they will be brokers or intermediaries (depending on your preference), and will need to be patient with it. Because they will be spending much time persuading local service providers to deliver services that suit the needs of local people rather than the demands of the \"clients\" who commission services, but who may be a little removed from the reality of the service delivery process itself. They'll also be spending a fair bit of time managing local people's expectations of the new agenda that is very bottom-up and community-focused, or at least the rhetoric is. Much as we would like neighbourhood managers to be \"in charge\" of local resources, in the short term, we're looking at evolutionary step-change. Criticism has repeatedly been levelled at local authorities for not being \"joined up\" and strategic enough in their work, but the criticism should be spread a lot further if these rather easy criticisms are to be fair ones. Other players will have to look at their work also, and housing associations are not exempt. And how the education and health money will filter down to the neighbourhood level can only be speculated on. But these two issues are interesting in their own right. The government has recently announced proposals to reduce bureaucracy and administration in the health service and to re-allocate saved money to frontline services provided by primary health groups. The Conservatives, in the meantime, have long been talking about abolishing local education authorities and giving a saved \u00a3500+ per pupil to school heads. And who would bet against New Labour lifting this idea for themselves? Cutting red tape and bureaucracy, and squeezing resources from the ivory towers to the frontline will always strike a chord with politicians and get a headline. What will be difficult for neighbourhood managers will be marshalling these resources to local priorities. The new local strategic partnerships have a clear remit to ensure neighbourhood managers get the support they need, and how they work with local authorities will be crucial on this point. But one of the problems that gets little coverage is the heavy cost of across-the-board local management approaches. Two local authorities in London - Tower Hamlets and Islington - tried out neighbourhood approaches to service delivery. Both approaches have their defenders and detractors, but they would probably both agree that the approach is commonly expensive. Economies of scale, successful and sustainable outcomes will hopefully result from future approaches to neighbourhood management, but the short-term bottom line cash cost will still count in many people's minds. And this is why the neighbourhood management agenda is potentially a threat to many local service providers, in a way that the regional agenda is a threat to local authorities. Duplication of roles is simply not sustainable and will need to be resolved in the fullness of time. And if it means more money, more expertise, more management at the frontline, just who will - or should - be standing in front of the neighbourhood manager, instead of behind them? \u0095 Aaron Cahill is regeneration policy officer at the National Housing Federation",

The money, available over the next 10 years, was announced today under the second round of the new deal for communities (NDC), set up to narrow the gap between the poorest areas and the rest of the country. Locally, each of the 22 NDC partnerships has developed a detailed 10-year plan to transform their areas through a wide variety of community-based initiatives and programmes, focusing particularly on reducing crime, improving people's health, tackling joblessness, raising educational achievement and improving the physical environment. Local proposals given the green light include: \u0095 Plans to wire up neighbourhoods with internet and new technologies \u0095 Capacity-building schemes, which aim to provide a decent environment for people to live in \u0095 Integrated drug reduction and education schemes \u0095 Neighbourhood management schemes \u0095 Community health centres \u0095 Resident advice centres linking key employment and education advisory services. Twenty-one are new partnerships, which join the 17 \"pathfinder\" partnerships awarded \u00a3774m in the first round. Announcing the details today in north Fulham, one of the funding winners, regeneration minister Hilary Armstrong said: \"This announcement reaffirms our commitment to help people in the most deprived communities in England to bridge the gap between their neighbourhoods and the rest of the country.\" \"This money will allow people through their NDC partnerships to make a real, positive change to the places where they live and work - according to their own priorities.\" But success relied upon the NDC partnerships engaging all the local \"stakeholders\", such as residents, local businesses, voluntary organisations and service providers, she added.
