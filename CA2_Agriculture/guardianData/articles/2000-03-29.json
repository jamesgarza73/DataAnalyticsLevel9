Free from censorship, the journalists went where they chose, reported the truth as they saw it and, according to the military, thus lost the US the war.</p> <p>Robert Elegant, a long-serving Asia expert, wrote later: \"For the first time in modern history the outcome of war was determined not on the battlefield but on the printed page and, above all, on the television screen.\"</p> <p>The military was bitter.

More correspondents than ever were set to cover the conflict - an astonishing 2,700 media people accompanied Nato forces when they entered the province at the end of the bombing campaign.</p> <p>Official arrangements for them were awe-inspiring. There was a daily briefing at Nato's headquarters in Brussels, a series of briefings at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in London, media meetings at the Pentagon, press conferences at the White House and statement after statement from President Clinton, Prime Minister Blair and numerous other Allied ministers.</p> <p>The revolution in communications technology; the satellite phone - the star of the war; instant television links from the front to the studio and between correspondents in the field; electronic transmission of photographs; and the internet; all were available to provide the public with an unprecedented overview of the war. The ordinary, literate citizen would be able to know more about the conflict than any war in history.</p> <p>Instead, we drowned in wave after wave of words and images that added up to nothing. \"Kosovo . . . turned out to be the most secret campaign in living memory,\" wrote the British war historian Alistair Horne. \"We were given lots of material but no information,\" says Sky war correspondent Jake Lynch. British journalist Peter Dunn wrote that it was \"the first international conflict fought by press officers.\"</p> <p>What had changed between Vietnam and Kosovo? Basically, the military has won its 150-year battle with war correspondents: journalists want to tell the public everything; the military's attitude is: \"Tell them nothing till the war's over, then tell them who won.\" Defeated by the military, governments and spin doctors, war correspondents now face an agonising choice. If they can no longer be heroes, do they want to continue as propagandists, subservient to those who wage the wars?</p> <p>The turning point in the battle was the Falklands. The nature of the campaign - a seaborne task force sailing to invade a group of islands 13,000km from Britain and 650km from the nearest land mass - meant that correspondents could not get to the war unless the MoD took them. In return for access to the action the correspondents had to accept the MoD rules. These were crippling. British correspondents only; no impartial neutrals. The British applicants were vetted - no room, for example, for veteran photographer Don McCullin, because his photographs tended to be too realistic.</p> <p>The 17 correspondents eventually accredited had to sign forms agreeing to accept censorship at source by six MoD \"public relations officers\". The result was that the war was reported exactly how the military wanted it to be.</p> <p>From this success, a theory developed. If you confronted the media and told them that, unlike Vietnam, this was a war that they would not be allowed to cover, they would become so desperate that you could do a deal - they would be allowed coverage but only on the military's terms.</p> <p>This theory was tested in the American invasions of Grenada and Panama, and worked well in the Gulf war. There the US and Britain operated a \"pool system\". Only a limited number of journalists would be allowed near the battlefield; they would be escorted by officers who would decide what they would see; and the journalists would have to make their reports available.</p> <p>Media groups complained that this amounted to censorship more dangerous than \"blue-pencil editing\", but accepted the conditions because they had no choice. By the time Kosovo came around, the lies, manipulation, propaganda, spin, distortion, omission, slant and gullibility involved in trying to report the conflict brought war correspondents to their current crisis point. Their role has never been more insecure.</p> <p>The most shameful event for the media during the Kosovo war was a US Congressional fact-finding mission to Yugoslavia between April 18 and 21. Congressmen felt they could trust neither the administration nor the media to tell them what was really happening - what an indictment of war correspondents. How did they allow this sorry state of affairs to come about?</p> <p>One difficulty is that the media have little or no memory. War correspondents have short working lives and there is no tradition or means for passing on their knowledge and experience. The military, on the other hand, is an institution and goes on for ever. The military learned a lot from Vietnam and these days plans its media strategy with as much attention as its military strategy.</p> <p>The Pentagon and the MoD have manuals, updated after every war, which serve to guide the way they will manage the media. These manuals follow basic principles - appear transparent and eager to help; never go in for summary repression or direct control; nullify rather than conceal undesirable news; control emphasis rather than facts; balance bad news with good; and lie directly only when certain the lie will not be found out during the course of the war.</p> <p>We are learning only now what lies were told and what secrets kept from us during the Kosovo war. We were not told that the CIA helped train the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) before the bombing began. We were not told that the KLA realised its attacks on Serbian policemen would bring retaliation on ethnic Albanian civilians but it went ahead anyway because it hoped that Serbian atrocities would bring in the West - as they did.</p> <p>We did not realise at the time that Nato was lying when it said it did not deliberately attack civilian targets. It was not until June that Nato's commander, General Wesley Clark, admitted that Nato planes were targeting \"phase 3\" [civilian] targets.</p> <p>We believed Nato when it said that after the war it would disarm and disband the KLA. But Jonathan Dimbleby wrote in January that the KLA remained in control of the streets, Nato had delivered Kosovo from one catastrophe into another, and Western leaders had remained silent about outrages taking place there.</p> <p>We believed Nato when it said it was systematically destroying the Serbian army in Kosovo, only to learn after the war that this was simply not so. We believed the figures the State Department and Pentagon released for the number of ethnic Albanians murdered by Serbs, only to see them come tumbling down - 500,000, then 100,000, then 10,000 - when Nato entered Kosovo and sufficient mass graves failed to materialise.</p> <p>True, the nature of the war played into the military's hands in keeping the true face of battle from the public. It was fought entirely from the air by means of a high-altitude bombing campaign, so no one - except the victims - really knew what was happening on the ground.</p> <p>Since they could not go to the fighting, correspondents either gathered at Nato headquarters or clustered along the borders of those countries surrounding Kosovo and tried to peer over. There they were interviewed on television by fellow journalists in studios in Europe and the US - who often had to brief them on the latest news before the interview started because the reporter on the spot usually knew nothing.</p> <p>According to veteran correspondent Robert Fisk, one of the few heroes left, this lack of access to the war produced two types of journalists - the \"frothers\" who had \"convinced themselves of the justice of the war and the wickedness of the other side\" - and the \"sheep\" who blindly followed Nato's word.</p> <p>The Russians watched and learned. When Moscow began its campaign against Chechnya, it used a system of news management based on Nato's. An information centre in Moscow offered Nato-style briefings that had to be accepted at face value, while at the front everything possible was done to hinder journalists and exclude them from battle zones.</p> <p>The sad truth is that today government propaganda prepares its citizens for war so skilfully that it is quite likely they do not want the truthful, objective and balanced reporting war correspondents once did their best to provide.</p> <p>Studies carried out after the Gulf war by Dr David Morrison, of the University of Leeds, showed that if there were a British mistake that caused a war to go badly, most people in the study felt that this mistake should never be reported, or only after the war was over.</p> <p>Further, where reporting in the Gulf was dominated by television as in no other war, most viewers were quite content with the reporting and considered it to be accurate and fair.

The effect of their stoppage so far is a city largely without water and with an increasing number of unburied dead.</p> <p>Their immediate cause is a demand for a pay increase of at least 70% to keep pace with hyper-inflation. But behind their protest is discontent that is starting to fan out across the country. It is a crisis that is being imperfectly masked by a stand-off between white farmers and the war veterans who have been invading their land.</p> <p>Harare is the least African of African cities, with its Woolworths, post-colonial hang-ups and a climate that produces little except perfect British summer days (before global warming mucked things up, even the rain was said to be considerate, and fell only at night).</p> <p>And the mood here would be familiar to anyone who was in Britain in the spring of 1997. There is a feeling, of rare unanimity, that the government is in meltdown. After 20 years of power, Robert Mugabe, one of the world's most durable leaders, is on the brink. The question is not whether he will lose power but when and how.</p> <p>Parliamentary elections are expected in May or June: they cannot be postponed much after that. For the first time the ruling Zanu-PF party is facing a plausible and reasonably united opposition in the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), led by the labour leader Morgan Tsvangarai.

      "bodyText": "More than 1,000 striking workers gathered amid the municipal rose bushes outside Harare's town hall yesterday for a third straight day. The effect of their stoppage so far is a city largely without water and with an increasing number of unburied dead. Their immediate cause is a demand for a pay increase of at least 70% to keep pace with hyper-inflation. But behind their protest is discontent that is starting to fan out across the country. It is a crisis that is being imperfectly masked by a stand-off between white farmers and the war veterans who have been invading their land. Harare is the least African of African cities, with its Woolworths, post-colonial hang-ups and a climate that produces little except perfect British summer days (before global warming mucked things up, even the rain was said to be considerate, and fell only at night). And the mood here would be familiar to anyone who was in Britain in the spring of 1997. There is a feeling, of rare unanimity, that the government is in meltdown. After 20 years of power, Robert Mugabe, one of the world's most durable leaders, is on the brink. The question is not whether he will lose power but when and how. Parliamentary elections are expected in May or June: they cannot be postponed much after that. For the first time the ruling Zanu-PF party is facing a plausible and reasonably united opposition in the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), led by the labour leader Morgan Tsvangarai. Since a referendum last month in which Mr Mugabe failed to win backing for a new constitution, even cool-headed analysts believe he can be beaten. Mr Mugabe's presidential term ends in two years, when he will be 78. Even supporters concede that another is unthinkable. The nature of the coming transition will be a defining moment not just for Zimbabwe but for Africa as a whole. Crucial message Theoretically, the country could face a period of cohabitation with Mr Mugabe as president and opponents holding the balance of power in parliament. If Mr Mugabe retires quietly, perhaps rescuing his own reputation as father of his country, it will send a crucial message to Africa's other uncertain democracies and quasi-democracies such as Kenya, Mozambique and Nigeria. Last week, President Abdou Diouf of Senegal lost an election after 19 years and stepped down at once, and gracefully. A military coup is possible if not probable. But the Zimbabwean army is distracted by its intervention in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, an adventure which is a prime cause of Zimbabwe's economic crisis. The more general assumption is that the opposition will score a moral victory in the coming elections but be done down either by rural vote-rigging or the constitutional clause that allows the president to top up the 120 elected members of parliament with 30 of his own choices. That may well prove unacceptable to his increasingly confident, vocal and numerous opponents. In a situation full of historic twists and ironies, the most bittersweet of all may be that President Mugabe's own greatest achievement could be his downfall. When he came to power in 1980 after the collapse of Ian Smith's rebel white regime, he instituted one of the best education systems in Africa (now in disarray). The under-35s who benefited are the ones suffering in the current crisis. Many of them were outside the town hall yesterday. Mabasa Mashiri, a father of four who works in the treasurer's department, takes home 8,000 Zimbabwe dollars a year. The dollar, once on parity with the pound, is now artificially high at just under 2p. \"Everything has gone up except my wages. It has changed our way of living. I can't give the children pocket money any more. We used to have cereals and bacon and eggs for breakfast, but we can't afford that any more.\" Everyone agreed what had to be done about it. \"The biggest tomato is rotten,\" said Cosmo from the housing department. \"It rots the whole barrel.

When Phil's party begins this evening with a spin aboard the millennium wheel, New Labour High Command will all be there, led by none other than Mr Tony himself. Indeed, it's a mark of how close he is to that least charlatan of focus groupies that, unable to attend his Sedgefield Labour party's AGM on Saturday, Mr T asked Philip to stand in for him! Philip found the perfect way to \"entertain\" his audience, with readings from his magnificent book, The Unfinished Revolution. As members drifted off, Philip tried to liven things up with the tale of a focus group that showed an unnamed MP - Mo, we imagine - as far more popular than expected. When he reported the grim results, Mr Tony replied: \"Then refocus your focus group.\" Delightful. Judging his audience to perfection, Phil then joshed about how the Blairs' constituency house had all the old furniture from their Islington house, and was \"such a throwback to the 80s\". That went down brilliantly. Well, it would, in a County Durham crowd of ex- miners, wouldn't it? Many happy returns, Phil!</p> <p>\u0095 Bad news on the Jonathan Aitken prayer front. With his friend Melvyn, you will recall, Jonathan has been praying for some Guardian colleagues but not for me. So I am planning to pray for him, that he will find it in his heart to pray for me. Unfortunately, it's been a busy day and I haven't had a moment to address God about this. Let's pray for better luck tomorrow.</p> <p>\u0095 News arrives from Derbyshire of a major gig yesterday at the Palace Hotel in Buxton, at the prison governors' association conference.

I hope it's to your Satisfaction. (Pause.)\" Pause? What, to allow the laughter to die down, you mean? Cancel the right to silence, if you must, Jack, and scrap trial by jury by all means. But please, no more jokes.</p> <p>\u0095 Distressing to report, new VW press officer Kate Thomson is even harder than Wayne Bruce, and reclaimed my lime-green Beetle on Monday, despite the fact that I was too ill last week to drive it far. Even so, being strictly objective as always, I agree with my colleague Richard Adams (who drove it over the weekend), that it is an eye-catching and impressive car. With its two-litre engine and leather seats, at \u00a315,000 it seems excellent value to us. (Is this enough for another week, or do we have to run the publicity shot as well?)</p> <p>\u0095 After yesterday's hilarious joke about the German child who does not speak until his fourth birthday, I must clear up a confusion. Unless expressly stated, gags that appear under the Frank's Chuckle title are not Frank's own. They are far too funny for that (to give a flavour of Dobbo's efforts, we gather that when comparing himself to Shagger Norris at a recent party, he replied: \"Oooh, I suppose you could say that I'm Whittington and he's Dick!\").

They do know that the 7,000 each year they compulsorily deport are only a fraction of those who leave.</p> <p>Meanwhile local government as a whole, which housed and welcomed 4,000 refugees from Kosovo last summer, has been struggling to find up to 40,000 bed spaces around the country so that the dispersal programme can be carried out. The Local Government Association itself, which has been locked in argument with Whitehall over who will foot the bill for supporting asylum seekers while their claims are processed, has not been above a little grandstanding of its own.</p> <p>But many of the fears and emotions stirred by this political debate are based on a myth. It is now the conventional wisdom at Westminster that nearly all asylum seekers are regarded by Middle England swing voters as \"bogus\" or rather \"abusive\" as Jack Straw rightly prefers to call them.</p> <p><b> Recognition rate</b><br></p> <p>In actual fact the Home Office last year gave refugee status or exceptional leave to remain in Britain in 54% of the asylum cases they managed to consider in detail. That is to say most asylum seekers in 1999 were genuine. It is not a statistic that you will hear quoted very often by MPs of any political hue. The refugee welfare organisations argue that the official Home Office figures obscure the actual \"recognition rate\" and it is worth working through the breakdown.</p> <p>In 1999, the year in which the wheels officially came off the asylum system in Britain, there were initial decisions given in 16,920 cases which were looked at in detail. Some 7,075 or 42% were given full refugee status and a further 2,110 or 12% were given exceptional leave to remain on compassionate grounds. The remaining 7,735 cases which were examined on their merits were refused.</p> <p>This gives a \"recognition rate\" of 54% which implies that most asylum seekers are genuine and not abusive. The Home Office however quotes a \"recognition rate\" of 47% for 1999.</p> <p>The Refugee Council argues this is because the Home Office includes the number of cases which are turned down either on \"safe third country grounds\" - that the asylum seeker passed through another country on the way to Britain - or on \"non-compliance\" grounds, such as not turning up to an asylum interview. Some 1,830 cases fell into the first category and a further 1,120 into the second.</p> <p>Refugee welfare groups say in neither category does the Home Office decide the case by looking at whether the applicant faces a threat of persecution in their home country and that failing to turn up to interviews is not necessarily an indication that the application is illegal.</p> <p>These calculations also fail to take account of asylum seekers whose cases are recognised on appeal. Between 10% and 20% of cases have succeeded on appeal. The appeal figures for 1999 are not yet available but they are likely to push the Home Office's \"recognition rate\" above 50%. Both arguments underline the fact that the official figures understate the proportion of asylum seekers whose individual plight is officially recognised.</p> <p>Critics point out that the Kosovo crisis made 1999 an exceptional year which saw a record level of 71,160 new asylum applications. \"The figures are higher than last year but so are the instances of human rights abuse, political persecution, internal conflict and turmoil raging around the world,\" said Nick Hardwick of the Refugee Council. \"This period also contains a European war described as 'the greatest humanitarian disaster since the end of the second world war,' by Nato spokesman, Jamie Shea.</p> <p>\"The UK is not the only country to be receiving a higher number of asylum seekers and, according to the most recent figures available, 10 other European countries received more asylum seekers per head of population than the UK. In fact, the poorest countries in the world take the highest number of refugees, far exceeding the numbers received in Europe.\"</p> <p>But these \"exceptional years\" are not as rare as might be imagined. The last time the \"recognition rate\" stood at over 50% was in 1993 when Bosnia blew up and the figure rose to 71% of asylum applications approved. The recognition rate in an average year is about 40%.</p> <p>Mr Straw argues that life on vouchers worth \u00a335 a week is bearable if the wait is no longer than six months. He justifies the compulsory dispersal and withdrawal of welfare benefits on the grounds that the genuine refugee will put up with the privations involved while the abusive will be deterred.</p> <p>The asylum system is at last beginning to recover from Ann Widdecombe's bungled computerisation. For the first time last month more decisions were taken - 8,000 - than the number of new applications that were received - 6,100 - but at this rate it is going to be a lot longer than six months before the asylum caseworkers at Home Office offices in Croydon get through the backlog of 103,000 cases.</p> <p>In the meantime, local government is arguing with Whitehall over who should put them up and look after them and who should pay the bills. When the Local Government Association tried last summer to put together a voluntary scheme to relieve the pressure on Dover, which saw some of the worst racial attacks, and London, the response was disappointing.</p> <p>A voluntary scheme which has been operating in advance of next week's dispersal programme initially produced offers of only 4,000 of the 40,000 bed spaces that were needed.</p> <p><b> Out of pocket</b><br></p> <p>As the LGA put it earlier this month: \"Local authorities have already taken on board almost 80,000 asylum seekers, including 1,500 via the LGA's voluntary dispersal scheme, which is fantastic.</p> <p>\"However, councils may not now be so willing to offer help as they continue to fear being out of pocket by millions. This can mean only one thing - either cutting back on frontline services like education and social services or hiking up council taxes which no council wants to do.\"</p> <p>It is no idle threat. There is now a list of 27 local authorities doing the rounds in Whitehall who have told the Home Office's new national asylum support service that they should be exempted from taking any further asylum seekers.</p> <p>Most are the London boroughs and the Kent councils who have loudly and repeatedly complained about being overburdened. But there are others on the list such as the Isle of Wight, Blackpool, and Northampton which are some distance from the overcrowded corner of south-east England.</p> <p>Isle of Wight council says straightforwardly that it already has problems of homelessness and a shortage of accommodation. It decided to tell the government it could not take any asylum seekers \"because we have our own problems\".</p> <p>Blackpool council leaders, angry at the way London boroughs and private firms have been placing asylum seekers in the Lancashire resort without telling them, protested last week to Jack Straw that they were using unfit properties as well as guest houses in Blackpool's main holiday area in breach of planning rules.</p> <p>Northampton borough council simply says that it has already taken 2,000 asylum seekers - well above the threshold laid down in the formula for deciding how many asylum seekers each area should take under the dispersal programme.</p> <p>What is common to many of the places outside London on this list is that they include some of the more marginal Labour and Liberal Democrat parliamentary seats and so could be counted as realistic prospects by the Tories in this May's local elections and, more importantly, in next year's general election.</p> <p>Jack Straw is hopeful that his new asylum law will both massively reduce the flow of asylum seekers to Britain and tackle the backlog. He also hopes that it will remove this issue, with its potential to hurt Labour's election prospects, from the agenda. The word inside the Home Office is that it might work as long as there is not another asylum emergency on the scale of a Bosnia or a Kosovo.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Mr Straw, all the signs are that one thing can be guaranteed about life in the 21st century - somewhere on the planet a war or an ecological disaster will leave millions homeless or facing persecution. Britain's asylum system is still in no state to cope.</p>",

The remaining 7,735 cases which were examined on their merits were refused. This gives a \"recognition rate\" of 54% which implies that most asylum seekers are genuine and not abusive. The Home Office however quotes a \"recognition rate\" of 47% for 1999. The Refugee Council argues this is because the Home Office includes the number of cases which are turned down either on \"safe third country grounds\" - that the asylum seeker passed through another country on the way to Britain - or on \"non-compliance\" grounds, such as not turning up to an asylum interview. Some 1,830 cases fell into the first category and a further 1,120 into the second. Refugee welfare groups say in neither category does the Home Office decide the case by looking at whether the applicant faces a threat of persecution in their home country and that failing to turn up to interviews is not necessarily an indication that the application is illegal. These calculations also fail to take account of asylum seekers whose cases are recognised on appeal. Between 10% and 20% of cases have succeeded on appeal. The appeal figures for 1999 are not yet available but they are likely to push the Home Office's \"recognition rate\" above 50%. Both arguments underline the fact that the official figures understate the proportion of asylum seekers whose individual plight is officially recognised. Critics point out that the Kosovo crisis made 1999 an exceptional year which saw a record level of 71,160 new asylum applications. \"The figures are higher than last year but so are the instances of human rights abuse, political persecution, internal conflict and turmoil raging around the world,\" said Nick Hardwick of the Refugee Council. \"This period also contains a European war described as 'the greatest humanitarian disaster since the end of the second world war,' by Nato spokesman, Jamie Shea. \"The UK is not the only country to be receiving a higher number of asylum seekers and, according to the most recent figures available, 10 other European countries received more asylum seekers per head of population than the UK. In fact, the poorest countries in the world take the highest number of refugees, far exceeding the numbers received in Europe.\" But these \"exceptional years\" are not as rare as might be imagined. The last time the \"recognition rate\" stood at over 50% was in 1993 when Bosnia blew up and the figure rose to 71% of asylum applications approved. The recognition rate in an average year is about 40%. Mr Straw argues that life on vouchers worth \u00a335 a week is bearable if the wait is no longer than six months. He justifies the compulsory dispersal and withdrawal of welfare benefits on the grounds that the genuine refugee will put up with the privations involved while the abusive will be deterred. The asylum system is at last beginning to recover from Ann Widdecombe's bungled computerisation. For the first time last month more decisions were taken - 8,000 - than the number of new applications that were received - 6,100 - but at this rate it is going to be a lot longer than six months before the asylum caseworkers at Home Office offices in Croydon get through the backlog of 103,000 cases. In the meantime, local government is arguing with Whitehall over who should put them up and look after them and who should pay the bills. When the Local Government Association tried last summer to put together a voluntary scheme to relieve the pressure on Dover, which saw some of the worst racial attacks, and London, the response was disappointing. A voluntary scheme which has been operating in advance of next week's dispersal programme initially produced offers of only 4,000 of the 40,000 bed spaces that were needed. Out of pocket As the LGA put it earlier this month: \"Local authorities have already taken on board almost 80,000 asylum seekers, including 1,500 via the LGA's voluntary dispersal scheme, which is fantastic. \"However, councils may not now be so willing to offer help as they continue to fear being out of pocket by millions. This can mean only one thing - either cutting back on frontline services like education and social services or hiking up council taxes which no council wants to do.\" It is no idle threat. There is now a list of 27 local authorities doing the rounds in Whitehall who have told the Home Office's new national asylum support service that they should be exempted from taking any further asylum seekers. Most are the London boroughs and the Kent councils who have loudly and repeatedly complained about being overburdened. But there are others on the list such as the Isle of Wight, Blackpool, and Northampton which are some distance from the overcrowded corner of south-east England. Isle of Wight council says straightforwardly that it already has problems of homelessness and a shortage of accommodation. It decided to tell the government it could not take any asylum seekers \"because we have our own problems\". Blackpool council leaders, angry at the way London boroughs and private firms have been placing asylum seekers in the Lancashire resort without telling them, protested last week to Jack Straw that they were using unfit properties as well as guest houses in Blackpool's main holiday area in breach of planning rules. Northampton borough council simply says that it has already taken 2,000 asylum seekers - well above the threshold laid down in the formula for deciding how many asylum seekers each area should take under the dispersal programme. What is common to many of the places outside London on this list is that they include some of the more marginal Labour and Liberal Democrat parliamentary seats and so could be counted as realistic prospects by the Tories in this May's local elections and, more importantly, in next year's general election. Jack Straw is hopeful that his new asylum law will both massively reduce the flow of asylum seekers to Britain and tackle the backlog. He also hopes that it will remove this issue, with its potential to hurt Labour's election prospects, from the agenda. The word inside the Home Office is that it might work as long as there is not another asylum emergency on the scale of a Bosnia or a Kosovo. Unfortunately for Mr Straw, all the signs are that one thing can be guaranteed about life in the 21st century - somewhere on the planet a war or an ecological disaster will leave millions homeless or facing persecution. Britain's asylum system is still in no state to cope.",

In return for aid and investment under the stability pact, Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia and Romania have all committed themselves to democratic and economic reform and creating a stable environment that will attract private investment. Representatives of Montenegro - considered likely to be Mr Milosevic's next target if it tries to break out of its federation with Serbia - and of the Serbian opposition, are also at the two-day conference. \"The real question for us [as donors] is how we actually spend the money,\" said James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank. More than 400 projects were proposed by the countries of the region to tackle the infrastructure with road- and bridge-building and to help reform economies, banking systems and tax systems. The projects were studied and whittled down to a manageable number. Thirty-five quick-start projects are expected to cost about \u00a3670m. A further \u00a3430m will go to projects to help democracy, security and reform. According to the World Bank, progress is most urgently needed in trade integration, anti-corruption measures and investment in regional infrastructure, to tie the region to the rest of Europe. \"This is just straight, simple, logical fact,\" Mr Wolfensohn said. \"If you don't do it, there is nothing we can do to help.\"",

If nothing else, Swank's Oscar is an acknowledgement from a male-dominated, largely sexist industry that there is not now, nor has there ever been, such a thing as gender certainty. Expect Billy Crystal to host the next Oscar ceremony in a Versace ballgown and, possibly, a tiara\" Neil Norman on the significance of Hilary Swank's Oscar for the cross-dressing film Boys Don't Cry, Evening Standard. \"Germaine Greer sneers and purports to pity women who wear high heels, pluck their eyebrows, try to look younger or even consider face-lifts. She, of course, is muscly, greying and scrawny with a skin like leather. I suspect this is because she's fundamentally unhappy and doesn't like herself very much\" Lynda Lee-Potter urges women to make an effort with their appearance, Daily Mail. \"Raising sons, I've become aware of the tragedy of what happens to men. You see these little boys who start off so feeling and empathetic, and by the time they're 10 they're told they have to 'fight' their way through disappointment. It doesn't seem to be socially acceptable for men to whine to their men friends\" Susan Sarandon, Aura. \"Sadie gets more jealous than I do. She says the only kiss she was happy seeing me do was with Stephen Fry, when I played his lover, Bosie, in Wilde\" Jude Law on how he and Sadie Frost, his wife feel about each others' love scenes, Cosmopolitan. \"When you're single and pregnant the first question is always 'So who's the father?' Women whisper it, looking concerned, while men leer it, nudging and winking\" Newsreader Kirsty Lang on being an SMC, Single Mother by Choice, Times. \"We Chest Can't Wait, tomorrow's going to be the bust day of the year. It's the countdown we have all been waiting for - only this one ends at TWO\" Headline writers get far too excited about National Cleavage Day, Sun.",

      "bodyText": "A pre-Raphaelite picture given to a young woman by the artist LS Lowry - and said to provide a poignant insight into the disappointments of his life - is expected to make \u00a3500,000 when it is auctioned at Christie's. Lowry - celebrated for his \"matchstick men\" paintings - gave Pandora (pictured left), a pastel by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, to Carol Ann Lowry, a young art student whom he befriended in the 1960s. Pandora is a portrait of Jane Morris, the beautiful wife of Rossetti's friend William Morris, with whom Rossetti fell hopelessly in love after the death of his wife Lizzie Siddal. Lowry formed a pre-Raphaelite society in 1966, with a handful of art lovers, to celebrate the work of the group of Victorian painters. A condition of membership was the ownership of a pre-Raphaelite work. The painter, a bachelor, obtained the portrait in exchange for one of his own pictures in 1968 and gave it to Carol, who was no relation, so that she could join the society. Carol later became Lowry's heir and hung the picture in her bedroom for many years. The society has not met since Lowry died in 1976. A museum dedicated to his work opened last year in his native Salford.",

Sylvia Paterson, 54, was consumed by jealousy of her stepson's wealth, Manchester crown court was told. She and her business partner John Holmes, 43 - also jailed for nine years - plotted to murder Paul Paterson and his wife Sarah on their wedding anniversary in April last year. They hired petty criminal Paul Thorlsog, who also worked as a circus clown called Banjo, to carry out the contract killing, but he contacted police. Sentencing them after a seven week trial, the judge, Sir Rhys Davies, said Sylvia Paterson was the driving force behind the plot . \"It is clear from what has transpired in this court that of the two of you, Sylvia Paterson, you are the stronger character and probably the driving force,\" he said. \"You John Holmes, wealthy as you are, possessed of a certain charm you may be, but you lack judgment.\" Undercover police officers taped Banjo's incriminating conversations with John Holmes. He was offered a total of \u00a340,000 to kill the couple. The court heard that Sylvia Paterson was \"not the sort of person to go around wanting to kill people\". A partner in her own property firm, she drove a Mercedes with the registration plate CLA 55Y - she had planned to pay for the murders by selling the plate. The defence claimed she had merely asked Thorlsog to carry out surveillance on her husband Kenneth, 77, whom she suspected was having an affair. She had paid Banjo a total of \u00a31,150 for his work. But she bitterly resented the wealth of her stepson and his wife - whom she dubbed greedy. She was angry that her husband had transferred his controlling interest in the family metal business to his son without telling her. The relationship between stepson and stepmother became frosty. She blamed Mr Paterson for the deterioration in her marriage. She believed that if the murder plot had been successful, the controlling share in the family metal business would transfer back to her husband and she would ultimately benefit. Holmes was a social climber educated at Gordonstoun and owned a dry cleaning business. He boasted that he was worth up to \u00a33m. He claimed Banjo had entrapped him in to the murder plot and said he began behaving like James Bond. Holmes claimed Banjo began hanging around his business dressed in a cowboy outfit or a clown's red nose. He said he had been taken in by Banjo, who had been kind to him while they were in jail in Merseyside in 1998, after he was convicted of indecently assaulting a 16-year-old waitress at a New Year's Eve party. Banjo had boasted of serving with the SAS and appearing as a stunt man in a James Bond film. In reality he had been thrown out of the army and occasionally joined a travelling circus as Banjo the clown in between prison terms for petty crimes. Paul and Sarah Paterson said in a joint statement: \"We are very relieved that this is now finally over - the last year has been very difficult for us and our family.

      "bodyText": "The Royal Society, Britain's most prestigious scientific body, was accused yesterday of bowing to pressure from opponents of a controversial theory of the origin of the HIV virus after it said it was postponing a conference called to debate the issue. One of the leading advocates of the theory, which holds that HIV was spread accidentally from chimps to man by western doctors testing an experimental polio vaccine in the Belgian Congo in the 1950s, said yesterday that the society was trying to give the idea's opponents more time to organise a counter-attack. Ed Hooper, whose book, The River, ignited a ferocious dispute among the HIV and Aids research community worldwide, said: \"I see this as an attempt by certain members of the scientific community to load the dice in their favour with regard to the origins debate, and one has to ask why they feel the need to do that.\" One biologist who reviewed the book called it \"the theory to beat\". In the US, researchers who have devoted their careers to meticulous research into more conventional theories of the origins of Aids have scorned The River and refused to attend the conference. One US scientist compared the Royal Society event to a discussion among astrophysicists of whether the moon was made of green cheese. One of the organisers of the conference, Robin Weiss, professor of virology at London's University College, denied that the delay in holding the conference - originally to be held in May, now rescheduled for autumn - had anything to do with pressure from opponents of the theory. \"I think that's risible. It's nothing to do with marshalling a defence.\" The postponement comes just three weeks after the sudden death from a malaria-induced haemorrhage of the leading scientific supporter of the polio vaccine theory, Bill Hamilton, one of the world's leading evolutionary biologists. Professor Hamilton had contracted malaria a few days earlier as he left the Congo, where he had been gathering evidence in support of the polio thesis. The May conference was his idea. His family is understood to have written to the Royal Society, asking that it go ahead as plannned. HIV, the virus which causes Aids, is now accepted to have spread to humans from apes, perhaps chimpanzees Most researchers support a version of the \"cut hunter\" theory, which supposes that a hunter in Africa - where apes are sometimes eaten - was infected by ape blood while slaughtering an animal. The polio vaccine theory, backed up in The River by nine years of research, 600 interviews and the study of thousands of articles, suggests that HIV was spread to humans by well-meaning western doctors in a tragic accident when the kidneys of infected chimps were used to manufacture an orally-administered polio vaccine. The Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, the research centre which made the vaccine - CHAT - more than 40 years ago, has always denied that chimps were used to make it. Hooper's evidence to the contrary is so far circumstantial. An independent inquiry set up in 1992 to investigate earlier, less thoroughly researched claims of a polio vaccine-HIV link recommended that residual samples of the vaccine stored at the institute be tested, but this was never done. Only now, in the wake of the furore triggered by the Hooper book, are three unidentified labs in the US and Europe about to carry out tests. Professor Weiss said the need to wait for the results of these tests was one of the reasons for delaying the conference. Although he admitted that the polio vaccine theory, as aired in The River, was the trigger for the conference, he downplayed its importance. \"It was Professor Hamilton's idea that the Royal Society was an appropriate forum to debate this scientific controversy. The Royal Society pondered it, brought in two HIV experts, and our advice was that it should not be exclusively about the book. \"Only one session is devoted to the polio vaccine theory. That's one of the many theories about how it came about. \"We thought we might get a better debate, and better science, if we delayed it a few months.\"",

Mr Satterfield and Mr Davis, along with two other members of their band, the Phoenix Horns, were paid a flat rate of $5,000 per week for the duration of the eight-month tour.

      "bodyText": "Phil Collins, whose personal wealth is estimated at \u00a3300m, yesterday sued two former backing musicians to recover royalty payments of $20,000 (\u00a313,000) he claims were made by accident. In the high court action Mr Collins, 49, yesterday claimed that excessive payments were made to Louis Satterfield and Rahmlee Davis, former members of Earth Wind and Fire, over a seven-year period. Mr Satterfield, a trombonist and Mr Davis, a trumpeter, deny that they have been overpaid and will claim that withdrawal of royalties would leave them destitute. The action, brought by Phil Collins Ltd, centres around a contract signed by the horn players prior to Mr Collins' 1990 world tour. Mr Satterfield and Mr Davis, along with two other members of their band, the Phoenix Horns, were paid a flat rate of $5,000 per week for the duration of the eight-month tour. The contract also contained a clause indicating they would receive a royalty of 0.5% on the resulting album. Robert Howe, representing Phil Collins Ltd, told Mr Justice Jonathan Parker that because of an accounting error, Mr Satterfield, 62, and Mr Davis, 51, were paid the half-point royalty on all 15 tracks of the album rather than the five tracks to which they contributed. These payments continued for six-and-a-half years before the accounting error was spotted. Mr Collins claims $780,000 (\u00a3500,000) has been paid to the pair since 1990, but he is not seeking to recover the full amount. Instead, said Mr Howe, what was at stake was the remaining sums Mr Collins's company claims the pair owe. Referring to the relatively small amounts of money involved, Mr Justice Parker said: \"It is not much is it ... For more than six years these royalties were paid and after six years a letter arrives to say in effect, 'Oh, it's a mistake'. It's not a very attractive position, is it?\" The hearing continues today.",

      "bodyText": "It was named by the Queen and heralded as the world's premier racing yacht. Team Philips, designed by the country's leading boat and aircraft designers, set off two weeks ago amid promises that Britannia would once again rule the waves. Last night, the \u00a34m state-of-the art catamaran that took four years to construct was staying afloat with the support of air bags after being partially broken up in waves that would not trouble an amateur sailor. Team Philips was preparing for a round-the-world race when a 25 foot section of its port hull snapped off while a 15 foot crack appeared on its other hull, leading to severe embarrassment amongst its ambitious crew, led by Pete Goss, 39, a veteran racing sailor and former Royal Marine. The yacht was on the third day of sea trials around 30 miles north west of the Isles of Scilly, in preparation for the attempt on the round-the-world, non-stop sailing record, when the crew heard a loud bang and saw one section of the hull slip away into the water. The crew immediately called the coast guard and the yacht was towed back to the port of St Mary's on the Isles of Scilly, where the damage is being assessed by navy divers. According to reports, the conditions Team Philips encountered in the Atlantic yesterday were mild compared to what it would have faced in any round-the-world race, leading to fears that there are problems with the yacht's design. Some of the best brains in yachting design were drafted into the project and the expertise of aircraft designers was used to make it the most aerodynamic sea vessel ever. During yesterday's sea trials, the wind was blowing at around 25 knots and there was a 10 foot sea swell, considered mild in sailing terms. Winds in the Southern ocean can reach up to 60 knots with sea swells of around 40 feet. Team Philips is today due to be towed back to the yard in Totnes, south Devon, where it was constructed from carbon fibre and epoxy resin, the same material used to build stealth fighter bombers. Its revolutionary design was set to make it the fastest yacht in the history of sailing, capable of reaching speeds of up to 40 knots per hour. Once the sea trials were complete the vessel was to compete in the 71-day Jules Verne round-the-world race and later this year in the Race, a round-the-world competition considered the most gruelling in yachting circles. As his boat bobbed on air bags in the water of St Mary's port and his dreams of shattering world records lay in tatters, Goss said: \"Obviously there is a huge sense of disappointment. \"There were times when I saw water wash over the hull names [of sponsors] on the port side and it made me feel like crying. This is a major set back, and I feel most for the team who have put their heart, body and soul into this. \"It is a sad, sad day, but we are going to regroup and come back stronger - it is not over yet.\" The entire \u00a34m for the yacht's construction was raised by sponsors and financial backers. Experts believe that serious miscalculations were made in the design of the 120 foot long yacht and that it was not heavy enough to sustain relatively mild waves and wind. The boat was constructed using a mould technique and the hulls are hollow. It weighs four tons but many racing yachts are heavier so that they can withstand rough seas and high winds. Goss had stated from the outset that his aim was to build the fastest yacht ever and he had assembled the country's leading constructors at the Totnes yard specially set up for Team Philips. Goss became a hero in the sailing world after he turned back in a Southern ocean hurricane to rescue his fellow competitor Raphael Dinelli in the 1996-97 Vendee Globe round-the-world single-handed race. Goss was later awarded France's highest honour, the Legion d'honneur by President Jacques Chirac and also an MBE.",

      "body": "<p>We'll meet you on some corner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.\" <strong> The Great Gatsby </strong> (BBC1) faithfully reproduces Fitzgerald's coolest lines, so why does it feel like a romp through the plot for GCSE revision? Maybe they shouldn't mess with the sacred books of adolescence. No fool has made a mini-series out of Catcher In The Rye (I see Jason Priestley, I see Tori Spelling). </p> <p>Paul Rudd should have been good as Nick, the young narrator who gets drawn into Gatsby's orbit in order to lead him back to Daisy, the love of his youth, because he has a soft white boy's face which is asking to be charmed. \"I had lost my capacity for wonder\", Nick says at the end. But all of the wonder has been missed out of this production and Rudd mostly just wanders around looking vaguely annoyed. </p> <p>Because no one is charming. Not Toby Stephens as Gatsby, whose performance shows you only that Gatsby is a fake and a crook and whose smile is not Gatsby's smile of \"eternal reassurance\" but Joey-from-Friends' cheesy girl-pulling grin. </p> <p>And not Mira Sorvino as Daisy, whose voice is supposed to be full of money, but is just moany. Why would Gatsby love her? She looks like a drowned goose and her hats like they've been made out of old pants. </p> <p>And the glittering Gatsby parties are as uninspired as the bunchy school-play frocks and the shampoo-advert flashbacks. So when Gatsby and his world are broken up by careless old moany Daisy and her husband Tom, who cares? There has been nothing for Nick to be enchanted by so there is no reason for disenchantment either, and when Gatsby gets shot in his swimming pool, you just wonder why the bullet didn't go through the lilo he's lying on. </p> <p>Don't men get lonely? If they do, popular culture's been keeping it a big secret. In <strong> Sex And The City</strong> (C4) Carrie and her three friends went to a fashion designer's funeral and pondered mortality.

      "bodyText": "We'll meet you on some corner. I'll be the man smoking two cigarettes.\" The Great Gatsby (BBC1) faithfully reproduces Fitzgerald's coolest lines, so why does it feel like a romp through the plot for GCSE revision? Maybe they shouldn't mess with the sacred books of adolescence. No fool has made a mini-series out of Catcher In The Rye (I see Jason Priestley, I see Tori Spelling). Paul Rudd should have been good as Nick, the young narrator who gets drawn into Gatsby's orbit in order to lead him back to Daisy, the love of his youth, because he has a soft white boy's face which is asking to be charmed. \"I had lost my capacity for wonder\", Nick says at the end. But all of the wonder has been missed out of this production and Rudd mostly just wanders around looking vaguely annoyed. Because no one is charming. Not Toby Stephens as Gatsby, whose performance shows you only that Gatsby is a fake and a crook and whose smile is not Gatsby's smile of \"eternal reassurance\" but Joey-from-Friends' cheesy girl-pulling grin. And not Mira Sorvino as Daisy, whose voice is supposed to be full of money, but is just moany. Why would Gatsby love her? She looks like a drowned goose and her hats like they've been made out of old pants. And the glittering Gatsby parties are as uninspired as the bunchy school-play frocks and the shampoo-advert flashbacks. So when Gatsby and his world are broken up by careless old moany Daisy and her husband Tom, who cares? There has been nothing for Nick to be enchanted by so there is no reason for disenchantment either, and when Gatsby gets shot in his swimming pool, you just wonder why the bullet didn't go through the lilo he's lying on. Don't men get lonely? If they do, popular culture's been keeping it a big secret. In Sex And The City (C4) Carrie and her three friends went to a fashion designer's funeral and pondered mortality.

      "body": "<p>Anthony Powell, who has died aged 94, is inevitably regarded as the English Proust, on the strength of the massive novel sequence A Dance to the Music of Time - 12 volumes and a million words - that became his central life's work. The Proust impact was more dominant and more obvious than that of other great European novelists and assorted influences from Petronius to modern Americans. Yet he will stand as essentially a comic writer in the English tradition - comic in the least uproarious way imaginable, reflective and often melancholic, the strong social spine to his work being the one distinctively uncommon feature in a branch of writing remarkable more for eccentricity than togetherness. </p> <p>In fact, Powell has a measure of both. He goes in for no deep psychological dredging, yet his novels rest on a firmer base of instinct and belief than is usual among the English comedians. He is fascinated by the play of time and chance on character, and it is by no means time and chance that always win. His narrating hero and anchorman, Nicholas Jenkins, is constantly being mildly surprised by the way things and people turn out. </p> <p>The unpredictability of life, as Powell himself described, is built into his structure as an essential part of it. Coincidences, so irritating to some readers, often happen in life, so why should they be forbidden to fiction? They are not excluded from Powell's novels, nor are all manner of trivia other writers might scorn or mishandle. It was his belief that with the right cook in charge anything could go into the cauldron. A novelist never lacks material - only the capacity and energy to handle it. </p> <p>Silver spoons, in the Powell kitchen, were never in short supply. The world he deals with, upper middle-class life from the 1920s onward, is his own world. The son and grandson of distinguished soldiers, he spent part of his childhood with his mother in rented accommodation in the home counties following his father, a lieutenant-colonel in the Welch regiment. He was at Eton, where he was a contemporary of Orwell and a founding member of the Eton Society of Arts, and then at Balliol College. After Oxford, he got a job with Duckworth, a small London publishing house, but left after nine years to write scripts for Warner Brothers, even paying a six-month visit to Hollywood. </p> <p>His first novel, Afternoon Men, appeared in 1931 and there were several others by way of prelude, followed by a long silence through the war - he joined his father's regiment before being transferred to the Intelligence Corps - and for some years after it. Then, in 1951, came the start of The Music of Time sequence, the title deriving from Nicolas Poussin's allegorical painting. The books emerged at roughly two-yearly intervals. </p> <p>The sequence, stretching across a quarter of a century from A Question of Upbringing (1951) to Hearing Secret Harmonies (1975), is more than a successful fictional marathon. It achieves a coherence, a central vitality which runs sluggishly at times but is never extinguished. His vast army of characters, clubmen all, pursue their power games through peace and war, marriage or divorce, in sickness and in health. War - as memorably described in the ninth volume, The Military Philosophers - is for Powell-people an extension of ordinary life; the flow is diverted but not stemmed, and rank is merely a crude token of what always existed in this elegantly competitive world. Some characters may only be glimpsed before disappearing from view, perhaps springing up like blades of grass in another volume years later. But nothing is lost or without its effect on the total pattern, while the allegorical master of the dance - as in the Poussin picture - smiles a shade malignly. </p> <p>Other characters are as perennial as the unreliable Dicky Umfraville, often in hot - or at least very warm - water, first noted leaving school under a cloud (not actually expelled, it was insisted) and last seen masquerading as an octogenar ian drug-addict. Or the ever-indulgent Lady Molly, whose house in South Kensington, more than the Ritz, is really open to all. </p> <p>With Powell's known writing method and this roving cast of hundreds there was naturally much speculation about who were the originals, in whole or more usually in part, of the characters appearing in the Dance. Sometimes the guess-who game was easy, as with the well-known Fitzrovian writer and reviewer Julian Maclaren-Ross who became the character X Trapnel. He appears as a novelist who holds forth at length about the art of the novel to the narrator Jenkins, also a novelist. He insists, and Jenkins doesn't contradict, that naturalism is only natural in the right hands and that reading novels takes almost as much talent as writing them. It can hardly be carrying presumption too far to assume that some of these ideas, as from novelist to novelist, are shared by the club's founding member, Powell himself. </p> <p>Others are more mysterious. Above all - literally so, if he had his way - there is the preposterous, the ever-haunting Widmerpool. Writhing with self-contradiction - a shade pathetic, a little absurd, more than a little sinister - he pervades the book, occupying a full half-century even of Powell's ocean of time. Where can this strange creature have sprung from? </p> <p>\"I am perpetually badgered about Widmerpool,\" Powell said when he was being interviewed for his 80th birthday. All sorts of originals have been suggested, from a recent lord chancellor down. Actually, so far as the character was drawn from life, \"he was drawn from somebody I served under during the war\". Powell tells us, in Journals for 1982-1986 (1995), that he first came across Widmerpool as a Cromwell- ian Captain of Horse in Hutchinson's Memoirs of the Civil War. Further volumes of the Journals were to appear, covering the years 1987-89 and 1990-92. </p> <p>If any character was going to beat time you felt it would have to be the apparently indestructible Widmerpool, but he goes in the end - suitably weirdly, collapsing (it seems) on a ritual jog at dawn. </p> <p>The inextricable mingling, in such a world as Powell's, of life and literature is made doubly apparent in the memoirs, To Keep the Ball Rolling, which Powell brought out in four volumes between 1976 and 1982. So happily do fact and fiction marry that it is easy to forget at times that you are reading about a real character in an actual place, and imagine you have slipped back into one of the novels. </p> <p>This reaction is particularly strong in the account - laconic and uninhibited like the fiction - of the early days in London when Jenkins is finding his feet in the literary world. The real-life memories develop, as the novels do, a sense of the significance of trivial and seemingly casual events, while large ones may pass invisibly by. Real people surge on to the scene like figures from a fantasy world: Augustus John, JC Squire, Rosa Lewis of the Cavendish, Maclean and Burgess (\"a notorious scallywag\"), the seedy diabolist Aleister Crowley at Simpsons, Tallulah Bankhead in a nightclub. </p> <p>We watch him becoming a Territorial recruit in the Royal Artillery (\"I felt that if the gunners were good enough for Tolstoy they were good enough for me\") and, rather more dangerously, pursuing a friendship with Evelyn Waugh. There are drinks with the Sitwells. The air of clubbishness, a cool, bookish intimacy, persists. Most of the way, that is. Just once in a while togetherness fails: \"In the flat below mine lived EM Forster (a writer whose books have never greatly appealed to me), but we never met.\" </p> <p>The trivia of the memoirs can be as funny as anything in the novels, and that means very funny indeed. Powell was of the opinion that most important writers, unlike most critics, have been well equipped with resources of humour; he even seems to have regarded it as a touchstone in evaluating them. </p> <p>Powell began as a writer for addicts - clubmen too, members of the Powell Club - but they increased rapidly. Or was it more like an open prison, in which Powell was governor and his readers were condemned to life sentences? They never wanted to be anywhere else for long, and they always came back at call. </p> <p>For a single writer to have put such a stamp on his day, and against the prevailing mood and style of the time, is a huge achievement. Powell didn't stand quite alone. Kingsley Amis was with him, dealing bold strokes in defence of the comic spirit; but the Amis comedy, though by no means all belly-laughs, was of a rougher order and failed to carry the approval of the bookish establishment. While Amis sold books, Powell won praise. It was ungrudging and well-earned. </p> <p>Largely it was a triumph of tone. A fastidious satirist, he never shouts and seldom mocks - or (except in the physical sense) moves very far. Powell's ideal hunting-ground seems a mile square and an inch deep, and there are bound to be some - particularly when so little, for such long spells, manages to happen - who get to find the inflexibly well-bred narrative voice a shade wearing. This is surely part of the fun. Powell's descriptive powers are clinically accurate and searching, and he is constantly putting himself in the way of good material. </p> <p>He is a conscientious mixer in the interests of his profession. It goes beyond clubland and the haunts of off-duty politicians, bureaucrats and important artists, though even lower life has its standards and good manners survive in unlikely places. Powell's world is well supplied with pubs without being beery, and there are times when the streets are thronged with well-born paupers conscientiously dodging their creditors. In taxis, of course. </p> <p>Violence, public and domestic, in peace and war, is muted by the modulated tones of civilised life. This relentless gentility would risk serious tedium without that sharpness of eye and wit. The head, you could say, remains as cool as the heart. He lacks what Amis and most of the later English humorists have possessed - sentimentality. That would have destroyed the work. </p> <p>He has a strong indulgence towards fantasy and eccentric behaviour, always with the assumption that it is observed and not invented. He can be ruthless, not always in expected settings. There are funerals, not necessarily particularly mournful occasions; death seems no more serious than life, which is indeed serious enough in so inflexible an English comedy world. There is an inclination for ritual, with serious sacrificial moments such as the drowning of a key manuscript in the Regent's Park canal (Books Do Furnish A Room), or the death - could it be possible after all? - of Widmerpool in the final volume of the sequence. </p> <p>The fiction adds up to a marvel of skill, originality, patience and sheer longwindedness.

      "bodyText": "Anthony Powell, who has died aged 94, is inevitably regarded as the English Proust, on the strength of the massive novel sequence A Dance to the Music of Time - 12 volumes and a million words - that became his central life's work. The Proust impact was more dominant and more obvious than that of other great European novelists and assorted influences from Petronius to modern Americans. Yet he will stand as essentially a comic writer in the English tradition - comic in the least uproarious way imaginable, reflective and often melancholic, the strong social spine to his work being the one distinctively uncommon feature in a branch of writing remarkable more for eccentricity than togetherness. In fact, Powell has a measure of both. He goes in for no deep psychological dredging, yet his novels rest on a firmer base of instinct and belief than is usual among the English comedians. He is fascinated by the play of time and chance on character, and it is by no means time and chance that always win. His narrating hero and anchorman, Nicholas Jenkins, is constantly being mildly surprised by the way things and people turn out. The unpredictability of life, as Powell himself described, is built into his structure as an essential part of it. Coincidences, so irritating to some readers, often happen in life, so why should they be forbidden to fiction? They are not excluded from Powell's novels, nor are all manner of trivia other writers might scorn or mishandle. It was his belief that with the right cook in charge anything could go into the cauldron. A novelist never lacks material - only the capacity and energy to handle it. Silver spoons, in the Powell kitchen, were never in short supply. The world he deals with, upper middle-class life from the 1920s onward, is his own world. The son and grandson of distinguished soldiers, he spent part of his childhood with his mother in rented accommodation in the home counties following his father, a lieutenant-colonel in the Welch regiment. He was at Eton, where he was a contemporary of Orwell and a founding member of the Eton Society of Arts, and then at Balliol College. After Oxford, he got a job with Duckworth, a small London publishing house, but left after nine years to write scripts for Warner Brothers, even paying a six-month visit to Hollywood. His first novel, Afternoon Men, appeared in 1931 and there were several others by way of prelude, followed by a long silence through the war - he joined his father's regiment before being transferred to the Intelligence Corps - and for some years after it. Then, in 1951, came the start of The Music of Time sequence, the title deriving from Nicolas Poussin's allegorical painting. The books emerged at roughly two-yearly intervals. The sequence, stretching across a quarter of a century from A Question of Upbringing (1951) to Hearing Secret Harmonies (1975), is more than a successful fictional marathon. It achieves a coherence, a central vitality which runs sluggishly at times but is never extinguished. His vast army of characters, clubmen all, pursue their power games through peace and war, marriage or divorce, in sickness and in health. War - as memorably described in the ninth volume, The Military Philosophers - is for Powell-people an extension of ordinary life; the flow is diverted but not stemmed, and rank is merely a crude token of what always existed in this elegantly competitive world. Some characters may only be glimpsed before disappearing from view, perhaps springing up like blades of grass in another volume years later. But nothing is lost or without its effect on the total pattern, while the allegorical master of the dance - as in the Poussin picture - smiles a shade malignly. Other characters are as perennial as the unreliable Dicky Umfraville, often in hot - or at least very warm - water, first noted leaving school under a cloud (not actually expelled, it was insisted) and last seen masquerading as an octogenar ian drug-addict. Or the ever-indulgent Lady Molly, whose house in South Kensington, more than the Ritz, is really open to all. With Powell's known writing method and this roving cast of hundreds there was naturally much speculation about who were the originals, in whole or more usually in part, of the characters appearing in the Dance. Sometimes the guess-who game was easy, as with the well-known Fitzrovian writer and reviewer Julian Maclaren-Ross who became the character X Trapnel. He appears as a novelist who holds forth at length about the art of the novel to the narrator Jenkins, also a novelist. He insists, and Jenkins doesn't contradict, that naturalism is only natural in the right hands and that reading novels takes almost as much talent as writing them. It can hardly be carrying presumption too far to assume that some of these ideas, as from novelist to novelist, are shared by the club's founding member, Powell himself. Others are more mysterious. Above all - literally so, if he had his way - there is the preposterous, the ever-haunting Widmerpool. Writhing with self-contradiction - a shade pathetic, a little absurd, more than a little sinister - he pervades the book, occupying a full half-century even of Powell's ocean of time. Where can this strange creature have sprung from? \"I am perpetually badgered about Widmerpool,\" Powell said when he was being interviewed for his 80th birthday. All sorts of originals have been suggested, from a recent lord chancellor down. Actually, so far as the character was drawn from life, \"he was drawn from somebody I served under during the war\". Powell tells us, in Journals for 1982-1986 (1995), that he first came across Widmerpool as a Cromwell- ian Captain of Horse in Hutchinson's Memoirs of the Civil War. Further volumes of the Journals were to appear, covering the years 1987-89 and 1990-92. If any character was going to beat time you felt it would have to be the apparently indestructible Widmerpool, but he goes in the end - suitably weirdly, collapsing (it seems) on a ritual jog at dawn. The inextricable mingling, in such a world as Powell's, of life and literature is made doubly apparent in the memoirs, To Keep the Ball Rolling, which Powell brought out in four volumes between 1976 and 1982. So happily do fact and fiction marry that it is easy to forget at times that you are reading about a real character in an actual place, and imagine you have slipped back into one of the novels. This reaction is particularly strong in the account - laconic and uninhibited like the fiction - of the early days in London when Jenkins is finding his feet in the literary world. The real-life memories develop, as the novels do, a sense of the significance of trivial and seemingly casual events, while large ones may pass invisibly by. Real people surge on to the scene like figures from a fantasy world: Augustus John, JC Squire, Rosa Lewis of the Cavendish, Maclean and Burgess (\"a notorious scallywag\"), the seedy diabolist Aleister Crowley at Simpsons, Tallulah Bankhead in a nightclub. We watch him becoming a Territorial recruit in the Royal Artillery (\"I felt that if the gunners were good enough for Tolstoy they were good enough for me\") and, rather more dangerously, pursuing a friendship with Evelyn Waugh. There are drinks with the Sitwells. The air of clubbishness, a cool, bookish intimacy, persists. Most of the way, that is. Just once in a while togetherness fails: \"In the flat below mine lived EM Forster (a writer whose books have never greatly appealed to me), but we never met.\" The trivia of the memoirs can be as funny as anything in the novels, and that means very funny indeed. Powell was of the opinion that most important writers, unlike most critics, have been well equipped with resources of humour; he even seems to have regarded it as a touchstone in evaluating them. Powell began as a writer for addicts - clubmen too, members of the Powell Club - but they increased rapidly. Or was it more like an open prison, in which Powell was governor and his readers were condemned to life sentences? They never wanted to be anywhere else for long, and they always came back at call. For a single writer to have put such a stamp on his day, and against the prevailing mood and style of the time, is a huge achievement. Powell didn't stand quite alone. Kingsley Amis was with him, dealing bold strokes in defence of the comic spirit; but the Amis comedy, though by no means all belly-laughs, was of a rougher order and failed to carry the approval of the bookish establishment. While Amis sold books, Powell won praise. It was ungrudging and well-earned. Largely it was a triumph of tone. A fastidious satirist, he never shouts and seldom mocks - or (except in the physical sense) moves very far. Powell's ideal hunting-ground seems a mile square and an inch deep, and there are bound to be some - particularly when so little, for such long spells, manages to happen - who get to find the inflexibly well-bred narrative voice a shade wearing. This is surely part of the fun. Powell's descriptive powers are clinically accurate and searching, and he is constantly putting himself in the way of good material. He is a conscientious mixer in the interests of his profession. It goes beyond clubland and the haunts of off-duty politicians, bureaucrats and important artists, though even lower life has its standards and good manners survive in unlikely places. Powell's world is well supplied with pubs without being beery, and there are times when the streets are thronged with well-born paupers conscientiously dodging their creditors. In taxis, of course. Violence, public and domestic, in peace and war, is muted by the modulated tones of civilised life. This relentless gentility would risk serious tedium without that sharpness of eye and wit. The head, you could say, remains as cool as the heart. He lacks what Amis and most of the later English humorists have possessed - sentimentality. That would have destroyed the work. He has a strong indulgence towards fantasy and eccentric behaviour, always with the assumption that it is observed and not invented. He can be ruthless, not always in expected settings. There are funerals, not necessarily particularly mournful occasions; death seems no more serious than life, which is indeed serious enough in so inflexible an English comedy world. There is an inclination for ritual, with serious sacrificial moments such as the drowning of a key manuscript in the Regent's Park canal (Books Do Furnish A Room), or the death - could it be possible after all? - of Widmerpool in the final volume of the sequence. The fiction adds up to a marvel of skill, originality, patience and sheer longwindedness. Technically the challenge, brilliantly met, must have been the handling of that enormous flock of free-range characters and the disposing of the maddening, mysterious, apparently indestructible Widmerpool. No wonder the face in Poussin's ritual dance came to look more malign than ever, for the Powell version must have called for a kind of anti-choreography remote from dancing. These hundreds of performers had to be trained to collide with each other as much as possible for fear that they might otherwise stray off and never be seen again. There must have been many who wished that for Widmerpool. Did Powell ever wish he had never created the man, if man it was? Keeping track of Widmerpool through 12 volumes and a million words, not really knowing whether he was ink or flesh, whether his true existence was inside the book or out, could have been a lifetime's job in itself. He popped up everywhere: something in the City, something in the army, employed in many an advisory capacity. He was a Labour MP under Attlee, an admirer of Mrs Ernest Simpson. Hugh Gaitskell - though nobody seems quite sure about this - was thought to have been instrumental in getting him a peerage. He influenced people's lives though not in the traditional way; more a kind of one-man quango. He would always be in touch. There was no danger of his getting lost. After the Music of Time sequence Powell continued to write - he had also been literary editor of Punch after the war and a long-time book reviewer for the Daily Telegraph - until immobilised by a series of strokes in the late 1980s. There was a short novel in 1983 dementedly entitled O, How the Wheel Becomes It! (Ophelia's mad scene, it fittingly turns out, provides the clue). And in 1986 he published The Fisher King, an elegant modern version of an ancient myth. He was made a Companion of Honour in in 1988. Powell had married Violet Packenham, sister of Lord Longford, in 1934 after a brief acquaintanceship. For many years they lived in a handsome regency house near Frome in Somerset.

In some cases, the DNA turned out to have had more in common with dandruff than dinosaurs. After a few months of boom and bonanza in the early 1990s, the nascent field of ancient DNA research imploded into recriminations, retractions and a good deal of cautionary finger-waggings about wishful thinking, the evils of contamination, and the sheer unlikelihood that a molecule as fragile as naked DNA would last long enough - or be tough enough - to make it to the fossil record.

Much of it has come from the Munich laboratory of Dr Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo, the researcher who first established the fact of ancient DNA by extracting it from museum specimens such as Egyptian mummies.

Their research paper, in the molecular biology journal Cell, set standards in scientific probity against which all other ancient DNA work is now judged. The DNA came from the first ever Neanderthal bones to be discovered, unearthed from the Feldhofer Cave near D\u00fcsseldorf in 1856. More than just a feat of laboratory work, this result went some way towards settling the biggest issue in anthropology - the origins of you and me. </p> <p>Neanderthals are everyone's idea of stone-age humanity. Burly and rugged, they played Rugby Union, ate mammoths for breakfast and laughed in the face of the mile-thick glaciers that covered most of Europe. They appeared sometime before 200,000 years ago and died out 29,000 years ago. Their natural home was Europe and western Asia, from Spain to Uzbekistan. Modern humans, with their sophisticated stone-tool technology and unaccountable liking for Rugby League, appeared in Europe around 40,000 years ago, overlapping with the Neanderthals. </p> <p>An acrid debate of long standing is whether the Neanderthals were directly ancestral to modern Europeans, or were replaced by them. </p> <p> The Feldhofer DNA allowed this question to be addressed directly, for the first time. If Europeans were descended from Neanderthals, then the sequence of the Neanderthal DNA might resemble that of modern Europeans more than that of, say, Africans or Australians. It turned out that the Feldhofer Neanderthal DNA sequence fell well outside the entire range of modern human DNA, irrespective of geographic or ethnic origin. It could still be the case that modern Europeans harbour Neanderthal genes, but the evidence from the Feldhofer Neanderthal DNA provided no positive support for this. </p> <p> Now comes a second Neanderthal DNA sequence, reported in today's Nature by William Goodwin of the university of Glasgow and colleagues. This DNA was extracted from one of the last and most easterly known of its kind. It came from the rib of a Neanderthal child who died 29,000 years ago in the northern Caucasus moun tains of southern Russia. Comparison with the Feldhofer DNA sequence shows a divergence of around 3.5%, comparable with ethnic or geographic differences between the DNA of different groups of modern humans.

Instead, the two Neanderthal DNA sequences form a tight and distinct group, set apart from modern human genetic sequences. It looks less and less likely that Neanderthals contributed to the modern human gene pool. The fact that neither Neanderthal fossil was preserved in especially favourable conditions for DNA survival - the bones were carelessly lying around in dirty caves - gives grounds for hope that more Neanderthal DNA sequences will follow soon.

He failed to persuade the Treasury to back his plans to scrap all charges which have halved visitor numbers at some museums, including the Science Museum in London. Yesterday, at the National Railway Museum in York, he said the government had announced the biggest ever increase in funding for culture and heritage, and promised further announcements on increasing access soon. However, the museum sector believes this will amount to an extension of free hours, days or special events but that universal free admission is dead in the water.

The political row over government attempts to repeal the legislation boiled over as a new legal opinion, released to the Guardian, concluded that section 28 will violate the human rights act, which comes into force in the autumn. Solicitors Belmont Hodgson found the section, which states that local authorities must not \"promote homosexuality\" or promote teaching of homosexuality in schools \"as a pretended family relationship\", breaches the rights to freedom of expression and to privacy and respect for family life. Both are enshrined as articles 10 and eight in the European convention on human rights, which will be incorporated into British law on October 2. The opinion comes a day after it emerged that another legal firm had also advised that schools would violate the right to privacy if they refused to allow pupils over 16 to have gay relationships. As private schools were left in confusion over the legal advice, the home secretary, Jack Straw, urged schools and other organisations not to panic over the implications of the human rights act. However, lawyers suggested that his attempts to play down fears over the new legislation by claiming it was all about balancing \"one right against another\", did not take account of the force of human rights law. Richard Campbell, of Belmont Hodgson, said: \"It is true that the human rights act is fluid because its provisions have not yet been tested in court, but there are certain principles in European and English case law where the courts are willing to apply very rigorous rulings over human rights.\" Legal debate over section 28 developed as the political row over the government's attempts to scrap the legislation spilled over at prime minister's questions in the Commons. William Hague challenged Mr Blair to disclose whether he would abandon attempts to repeal the legislation if it were defeated again. The prime minister said: \"No, we remain committed to the repeal of it and we in particular remain absolutely set against the mischievous propaganda campaign run against this that has suggested that in some way by repealing clause 28 children in our schools are going to have their sex education lessons changed.\" Since 1994, section 28 had not applied to schools in England and Wales, which set sex education policy according to governors, staff and parents, he said. Schools would continue to set policy and parents would still have the right to withdraw children from sex education lessons. Goaded by Mr Hague to drop \"politically correct propaganda\", the prime minister hit back. \"The truth of the matter is that this campaign [against section 28 repeal] is based on people who don't want to come out and say they are prejudiced against gay people and so they hide behind the issue of child protection.\"",

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone, the leftwing candidate for London mayor, yesterday vowed to recognise gay marriages in the capital and said the Greater London authority would boycott homophobic companies. The planned contract ban could hit Stagecoach, the bus company owned by millionaire Brian Souter who has been funding the campaign in Scotland to keep section 28. Stagecoach has multi-million pound contracts with London buses. In a pitch to London's large gay community, Mr Livingstone also claimed he would try to repeal section 28 banning the promotion of homosexuality in schools by local councils. Mr Livinstone's aides said that other candidates for mayor, including Frank Dobson and Steve Norris, had recently backed an important extension of gay rights when they addressed a gay and lesbian election meeting at the National Film School. They conceded that the GLA would have no legal powers to recognise same sex relationships, or provide gay partners with new legal rights. They also said the authority will have no powers over education and would therefore be unable to repeal section 28 unilaterally. They nevertheless claimed a civic register for gay couples would have great symbolic importance and at least give gays a chance to celebrate their marriage with the official support of the GLA. Defending his decision to boycott homophobic companies, Mr Livingstone said: \"I will not tolerate companies that are commercially involved with the GLA if they display homophobia. I think Brian Souter's campaign in Scotland is homophobic. I would not countenance London buses becoming associated with that sort of cause.\" It is not clear whether local councils are entitled to boycott companies because they are acting in a discriminatory way. The Greater London Council in the 1980s ran a policy of contract compliance requiring its sub-contractors to recognise trades unions and give minorities full rights in the workforce. The Conservative government subsequently removed many of the powers and said that contracts should be handed out on strictly commercial basis. The Home Office has formally opposed recognised same sex relationships although the European court of human rights has recently ruled that the partner in a same sex relationship can stay on in a tenancy if the other partner dies. The Home Office has also recently accepted that a foreign partner who has been living with a British national for two years in a relationship \"akin to marriage\" can claim residency. Many countries formally recognise same sex marriages giving partners rights to compensation and pensions. Mr Livingstone's remarks came as Mr Norris, the Conservative mayoral candidate, said he is to marry Emma Courtney, the mother of his child, on Saturday week.",

And, to be fair, there are a lot of White Van Men out there. </p> <p>The show, which has been going for five years, actually pulls in large numbers of the country's consumer electronics dealers. They come not only to compare notes on microwave oven promotions, but also eager to find out what they'll be filling their shelves with later in the year. </p> <p>So what do the people at the sharp end really make of the product the makers insist will change our lives?

Not only can you use it to surf the net (see <a href=\"http://www.coolfridge.com\">www.coolfridge.com</a> ), shoot video messages and play MP3 music files, it also helps out with your shopping. By touching its screen you can find out what food is in the fridge and how long before it starts going mouldy. In theory, every time you run out of milk, it could also email the supermarket, which would oblige by whizzing over a pint of semi-skimmed. </p> <p> <strong> The reaction: </strong> The fridge was the undoubted star of the show. But will anyone buy it? One Leeds based dealer thought he knew of a few footballers who would be well up for it. Others weren't so sure. \"This fridge is not likely to be bought by a family man. The geeks who'll be impressed by this sort of thing don't tend to have girlfriends let alone large families,\" he said with a smirk. </p> <p> <strong> What the dealers really want:</strong> A fridge that instantly chills warm beer. </p> <p> <strong> Vivanco's MP3 player </strong></p> <p><strong> When's it due?</strong> In the next couple of months, priced at \u00a3130. </p> <p> <strong> The hype: </strong> The world's smallest MP3 player.

There are blokes out there who'll think nothing of spending \u00a3130 just to say that they own the world's smallest player.\" </p> <p>Others thought its size might be its downfall. \"People are always losing their personal MD and tape players.

One dealer was so engrossed in a Japanese promo film of a flower show you'd think he was watching an Oscar-laden epic. Simon Hughes, a dealer from Lowestoft, Suffolk confidently predicted that \"in seven years time all TVs will look like this\". </p> <p> <strong> What the dealers really want:</strong> This product priced at \u00a3200 with built in digital TV decoder and surround sound. </p> <p> <strong> Toshiba SD900E DVD-Audio Player </strong></p> <p><strong> When's it due?</strong> Late summer sporting a price tag of around \u00a31,300. </p> <p> <strong> The hype: </strong> It'll soon be time to ditch your CD player. This not only plays standard CDs and DVD movies, but also playback discs mixed for DVD-Audio. This new format has a significantly higher frequency capability and wider dynamic range than standard audio CDs. </p> <p> <strong> The reaction:</strong> Not entirely a crowd-pleaser. \"It might persuade some of these so-called golden-eared hi-fi types to buy a DVD player,\" suggested one dealer. Others thought that the impending format war with Super Audio CD - and the way in which the British public seemed perfectly happy with the sound of CDs - would prevent it from ever going mass-market. </p> <p> <strong> What the dealers really want:</strong> \"If I had a pound for everyone who's asked for a DVD recorder that also plays back American discs, I'd probably own half of South ern England,\" said a London dealer. </p> <p> <strong> Dyson DC06 Robot vacuum cleaner </strong></p> <p><strong> When's it due?</strong> Late summer for around \u00a32,500 </p> <p> <strong> The hype: </strong> The world's first commercially available robot vacuum cleaner. The processing power of several PCs enables it to move methodically through your house, disposing of the dust. If it's given any grief by Fido or Tiddles, it plays dead for 30 seconds before continuing its chores. </p> <p> <strong> The reaction: </strong> \"This is straight out of Absolutely Fabulous,\" proclaimed one south-coast dealer. \"You can just picture some rich London housewife flicking through Harper's &amp; Queens while this robot whizzes under their feet picking up crumbs from last nights dinner party.\" </p> <p> <strong> What the dealers really want:</strong> A robot that also cooks, does the washing-up and looks after the kids.

Others thought that the impending format war with Super Audio CD - and the way in which the British public seemed perfectly happy with the sound of CDs - would prevent it from ever going mass-market. What the dealers really want: \"If I had a pound for everyone who's asked for a DVD recorder that also plays back American discs, I'd probably own half of South ern England,\" said a London dealer. Dyson DC06 Robot vacuum cleaner When's it due? Late summer for around \u00a32,500 The hype: The world's first commercially available robot vacuum cleaner. The processing power of several PCs enables it to move methodically through your house, disposing of the dust. If it's given any grief by Fido or Tiddles, it plays dead for 30 seconds before continuing its chores. The reaction: \"This is straight out of Absolutely Fabulous,\" proclaimed one south-coast dealer. \"You can just picture some rich London housewife flicking through Harper's &amp; Queens while this robot whizzes under their feet picking up crumbs from last nights dinner party.\" What the dealers really want: A robot that also cooks, does the washing-up and looks after the kids. If it's female, blonde, of Scandinavian origin, and taking a year out before university, so much the better.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Not really ready for big league<br> Euro League Football</strong> PC \u00a329.99 Dinamic/Sold Out ** <br> It's a videogame of two halves, the football market. Real fans have to spend big bucks buying Eidos Interactive's Championship Manager for the cerebral part of the sport, and Konami's International Superstar Soccer Pro (latest version: Evolution) for the wrist-pumping arcade-style action. </p> <p>Unwisely, perhaps, Dinamic has decided to buck tradition by combining the two approaches in one game, thus satisfying everyone - or no one. </p> <p>Dinamic is a Spanish software house not well known in the UK, but the management part of Euro League Football bears a strong resemblance to the old Gremlin Graphics title, Premier Manager 99. Gremlin was taken over by Infogrames, a French software house, and it seems that Dinamic took over the game's development with Premier Manager 98/99. </p> <p>The stats are plentiful and reasonably up to date: for example, Hoddle is managing Southampton, though Wilson is still managing Sheffield Wednesday in ELF-land. </p> <p>I didn't recognise the arcade part of the game - Dinamic's PC F\u00fatbol 2000 is a possible source - and wasn't greatly impressed by it. You can get away with disgraceful tackles from behind but perfectly good tackles are penalised, while forwards are wrongly called offside or, if they break free, miss open goals... but it's just a realistic simulation of Premiership football. </p> <p>On the downside, the animations are stilted, the commentary (by Dominik Diamond) is tedious and the \"radar\" (overhead) view doesn't show which player you are controlling: not very useful. </p> <p>But the real problem is that the whole enterprise is flawed. You can be a great manager but still lose games by being inept at the arcade action, or you can win these matches easily while more or less ignoring much of the management stuff. </p> <p>Still, my son, aged 14, described it as \"blatantly an immense game\" (very, very enjoyable). At the time he was trying for a hat trick of goals scored by his keeper dribbling the length of the pitch and walking the ball into the net. (JS)</p> <p><strong>Lara's looks are a revelation</strong><br> <strong>Tomb Raider 4: The Last Revelation</strong> Sega Dreamcast \u00a339.99 Core Design/Eidos ***<br> It has taken four years but Lara has finally come back to a Sega machine. While it's probably best forgotten that Tomb Raider first appeared on the Saturn, this Dreamcast release has no such graphical inferiority. Although this is essentially the same game that recently appeared on the PlayStation, some fancy enhancements push this up to accelerated PC level. </p> <p>In fact, The Last Revelation is probably the best looking version so far. The Dreamcast remains unstretched, but the visuals capture the Egyptian mood perfectly. The plot sees Lara returning to what she does best - raiding tombs in her usual physics-defying manner - but this time she stays in Egypt rather than globetrotting. So, what is the Last Revelation? The chances are only a few will ever find out because this is a very tricky game. Patience of a saint? </p> <p>You may just have a chance. Mere mortals will need to prepare for periods of intense frustration and annoyance, punctuated by some superb sequences, that mostly start you thinking 'If only....' If only Lara would move in the direction you point. If only she jumped when you press \"jump\" rather than run those fatal final steps. If only the puzzles were less obscure. Actually, the last wish is not too far off the mark. Unlike the aimless wandering of yore, Lara will usually find the answers nearby - a much-appreciated improvement.</p> <p> After all, you don't want to spend too long worrying about the puzzles when you've got that antiquated control system to fight.

      "bodyText": "Not really ready for big league Euro League Football PC \u00a329.99 Dinamic/Sold Out ** It's a videogame of two halves, the football market. Real fans have to spend big bucks buying Eidos Interactive's Championship Manager for the cerebral part of the sport, and Konami's International Superstar Soccer Pro (latest version: Evolution) for the wrist-pumping arcade-style action. Unwisely, perhaps, Dinamic has decided to buck tradition by combining the two approaches in one game, thus satisfying everyone - or no one. Dinamic is a Spanish software house not well known in the UK, but the management part of Euro League Football bears a strong resemblance to the old Gremlin Graphics title, Premier Manager 99. Gremlin was taken over by Infogrames, a French software house, and it seems that Dinamic took over the game's development with Premier Manager 98/99. The stats are plentiful and reasonably up to date: for example, Hoddle is managing Southampton, though Wilson is still managing Sheffield Wednesday in ELF-land. I didn't recognise the arcade part of the game - Dinamic's PC F\u00fatbol 2000 is a possible source - and wasn't greatly impressed by it. You can get away with disgraceful tackles from behind but perfectly good tackles are penalised, while forwards are wrongly called offside or, if they break free, miss open goals... but it's just a realistic simulation of Premiership football. On the downside, the animations are stilted, the commentary (by Dominik Diamond) is tedious and the \"radar\" (overhead) view doesn't show which player you are controlling: not very useful. But the real problem is that the whole enterprise is flawed. You can be a great manager but still lose games by being inept at the arcade action, or you can win these matches easily while more or less ignoring much of the management stuff. Still, my son, aged 14, described it as \"blatantly an immense game\" (very, very enjoyable). At the time he was trying for a hat trick of goals scored by his keeper dribbling the length of the pitch and walking the ball into the net. (JS) Lara's looks are a revelation Tomb Raider 4: The Last Revelation Sega Dreamcast \u00a339.99 Core Design/Eidos *** It has taken four years but Lara has finally come back to a Sega machine. While it's probably best forgotten that Tomb Raider first appeared on the Saturn, this Dreamcast release has no such graphical inferiority. Although this is essentially the same game that recently appeared on the PlayStation, some fancy enhancements push this up to accelerated PC level. In fact, The Last Revelation is probably the best looking version so far. The Dreamcast remains unstretched, but the visuals capture the Egyptian mood perfectly. The plot sees Lara returning to what she does best - raiding tombs in her usual physics-defying manner - but this time she stays in Egypt rather than globetrotting. So, what is the Last Revelation? The chances are only a few will ever find out because this is a very tricky game. Patience of a saint? You may just have a chance. Mere mortals will need to prepare for periods of intense frustration and annoyance, punctuated by some superb sequences, that mostly start you thinking 'If only....' If only Lara would move in the direction you point. If only she jumped when you press \"jump\" rather than run those fatal final steps. If only the puzzles were less obscure. Actually, the last wish is not too far off the mark. Unlike the aimless wandering of yore, Lara will usually find the answers nearby - a much-appreciated improvement. After all, you don't want to spend too long worrying about the puzzles when you've got that antiquated control system to fight. So why bother? Well, the characterisation and storyline are of sufficient quality to encourage perseverance. Also, solving a stubborn puzzle or back-flipping over a chasm is undeniably good fun. This is the best version yet and will do for now, but a radical overhaul is needed before Lara returns again.

      "body": "<p>Do your web pages talk? It sounds like a line from a Monty Python sketch. But it could soon become a serious question which top e-commerce directors will increasingly have to answer. </p> <p>A small London-based company called Tangozebra (formerly Insigma Technologies) is fast-emerging as one of the leading architects of so-called web voiceovers. Last November the company picked up a prestigious British Computer Society award for its innovative web software, successfully fending off competition from IT mega-giants such as IBM, ICL and BT. </p> <p>Tangozebra's patented software, N-XEC, is to go public in the next couple of months, and already it's generating a lot of noise in an industry that is desperate to prove it can meet high customer service expectations. </p> <p>Written in Java and designed to deal with limited bandwidth, N-XEC can be programmed to introduce images and sound to web pages at specified times. No plug-ins or streaming are involved because the audio is played directly from the cache on your computer. N-XEC also lets web pages talk to surfers when they are off-line. </p> <p>Tangozebra (the name comes from an old movie) is in discussions with banks, online retailers and a host of major dot.coms who have had private previews. Web voiceovers have the potential, it is said, to eradicate many fears of e-customers. </p> <p>\"When the user comes to an initial shopping form, a voice will start invisibly behind the page,\" explains Tangozebra's co-founder and director, James Booth. \"It might simply say 'please enter your name' or 'it's alright to buy online'. You can make the pages say what you want them to say. </p> <p>\"If you're a mainstream high street store and you know there is a good chance of getting online orders from mainland Europe, you can add a flag icon; if you click on it, you could get a reassuring guiding voice in German or Italian talking over the form. </p> <p>\"If the end user forgets, for example to put their email address in, we can kick off a voice file at the point they click submit. You might even have a celebrity voice in there.\" </p> <p>But Booth thinks the voice option should be optional. The forms Tangozebra is currently working on let people switch a voiceover on or off. </p> <p>It potentially gives web site owners more control over the activities of surfers. If it can be applied to e-commerce sites successfully then voiceovers could prevent people from moving at random around sites. Instead they will be led by carefully-synchronized online voice prompts. </p> <p>Tangozebra has already carried out some work for the NHS, HMV, Waterstones and several pop stars including George Michael. When it goes formally into the marketplace, it plans to offer the new media industry generic talking web forms that e-commerce companies can bolt onto existing services. </p> <p> Dot.coms will be offered a package of promotional services licensed to run using the new technology. For example, a visitor to a site could be told by a voice to stay where they are for the next three minutes to find out how to win a flight to New York. Banner ads using N-XEC technology have been successfully piloted on Excite. They deliver synchronized advertising images and audio content to surfers. Tangozebra is planning to develop them with key online players such as QXL and Freeserve. </p> <p>Fusing sound with web pages for the benefit of e-commerce is potentially an extremely lucrative market. But Tangozebra is not the only company working in this area. UK-based technology company, Vocalis has introduced services using voice-recognition software which lets people hear the content of web pages over the phone. SpeecHTML converts hyperlinks on web pages into verbal options - just as you are presented with options when you phone up your ISP or your local cinema. The Royal National Institute for the Blind and financial businesses are buying into this service to improve accessibility to their own internet-based operations. </p> <p>Vocalis also offers SpeechMail so you can phone up and have your email messages read out to you. If you like, you can then reply over the phone and your message is sent as a WAV audio file to the recipient. The voices do not sound 100% natural at the moment but Vocalis hopes to make improvements soon. Some ISPs are already offering this service to their subscribers for the cost of a standard national rate phone call. </p> <p>Poor customer service is a charge often levelled at dot.coms.

      "bodyText": "Do your web pages talk? It sounds like a line from a Monty Python sketch. But it could soon become a serious question which top e-commerce directors will increasingly have to answer. A small London-based company called Tangozebra (formerly Insigma Technologies) is fast-emerging as one of the leading architects of so-called web voiceovers. Last November the company picked up a prestigious British Computer Society award for its innovative web software, successfully fending off competition from IT mega-giants such as IBM, ICL and BT. Tangozebra's patented software, N-XEC, is to go public in the next couple of months, and already it's generating a lot of noise in an industry that is desperate to prove it can meet high customer service expectations. Written in Java and designed to deal with limited bandwidth, N-XEC can be programmed to introduce images and sound to web pages at specified times. No plug-ins or streaming are involved because the audio is played directly from the cache on your computer. N-XEC also lets web pages talk to surfers when they are off-line. Tangozebra (the name comes from an old movie) is in discussions with banks, online retailers and a host of major dot.coms who have had private previews. Web voiceovers have the potential, it is said, to eradicate many fears of e-customers. \"When the user comes to an initial shopping form, a voice will start invisibly behind the page,\" explains Tangozebra's co-founder and director, James Booth. \"It might simply say 'please enter your name' or 'it's alright to buy online'. You can make the pages say what you want them to say. \"If you're a mainstream high street store and you know there is a good chance of getting online orders from mainland Europe, you can add a flag icon; if you click on it, you could get a reassuring guiding voice in German or Italian talking over the form. \"If the end user forgets, for example to put their email address in, we can kick off a voice file at the point they click submit. You might even have a celebrity voice in there.\" But Booth thinks the voice option should be optional. The forms Tangozebra is currently working on let people switch a voiceover on or off. It potentially gives web site owners more control over the activities of surfers. If it can be applied to e-commerce sites successfully then voiceovers could prevent people from moving at random around sites. Instead they will be led by carefully-synchronized online voice prompts. Tangozebra has already carried out some work for the NHS, HMV, Waterstones and several pop stars including George Michael. When it goes formally into the marketplace, it plans to offer the new media industry generic talking web forms that e-commerce companies can bolt onto existing services. Dot.coms will be offered a package of promotional services licensed to run using the new technology. For example, a visitor to a site could be told by a voice to stay where they are for the next three minutes to find out how to win a flight to New York. Banner ads using N-XEC technology have been successfully piloted on Excite. They deliver synchronized advertising images and audio content to surfers. Tangozebra is planning to develop them with key online players such as QXL and Freeserve. Fusing sound with web pages for the benefit of e-commerce is potentially an extremely lucrative market. But Tangozebra is not the only company working in this area. UK-based technology company, Vocalis has introduced services using voice-recognition software which lets people hear the content of web pages over the phone. SpeecHTML converts hyperlinks on web pages into verbal options - just as you are presented with options when you phone up your ISP or your local cinema. The Royal National Institute for the Blind and financial businesses are buying into this service to improve accessibility to their own internet-based operations. Vocalis also offers SpeechMail so you can phone up and have your email messages read out to you. If you like, you can then reply over the phone and your message is sent as a WAV audio file to the recipient. The voices do not sound 100% natural at the moment but Vocalis hopes to make improvements soon. Some ISPs are already offering this service to their subscribers for the cost of a standard national rate phone call. Poor customer service is a charge often levelled at dot.coms. Many cannot afford expensive call centres so they rely upon email responses instead. While talking web pages might make the lives of technical directors even more complicated, they could help to simplify e-commerce and reassure online shoppers whose first instinct is to pick up the phone rather than boot up a lap top. These new advances underline how the new media industry is working overtime to try to make the net more accessible. Just as silent movies were eventually overtaken by talkies, it looks as if silent web pages could soon become a thing of the past.",

Jeffrey Koplan, the director of US centres for disease control, said: \"This increase in tobacco use among pregnant teens is very disturbing. It puts a troubling spotlight on two of our biggest national concerns - teen pregnancy and tobacco use among young people in this country.\" The sharpest percentage increase in childbirths was among women aged between 34 and 44, reflecting an accumulation of postponed births by women waiting as long as possible before interrupting their careers and an improvement in medical fertility techniques. However, the national birthrate of 2.06 births for an average woman in the course of her lifetime remains below the \"replacement\" level - required for births to compensate for deaths and thus maintain the population. There were demographic shifts within that overall figure; black American women and those of Mexican, and Puerto Rican origins are having babies at above the replacement level. While white women, Asians, Native Americans and Cubans are not replenishing their numbers.",

      "body": "<p>The police spokesman rattled off the details of the latest gangland killing in a monotone - the victim had a bushy moustache and a bullet in the head; he was wrapped in blankets and tied up with electrical cable.</p> <p>It appeared to be just another \"settling of scores\" for the drug-trafficking underworld in the border city of Juarez, said the police official, Juan Manuel Carmona. His tone suggested that this killing was hardly worth noting.</p> <p>Juarez - a dusty, undistinguished city of 1.3m across the Rio Bravo river from El Paso, Texas - is home to one of Mexico's two main drug cartels; the other is based in Tijuana, just over the border from San Diego, California.</p> <p>There has been one killing a week on average in Juarez since the beginning of the year and even more in Tijuana. The execution style of a number of these murders has prompted reports of a turf war between the cartels.</p> <p>\"There is a subculture of violence in these zones. The modus operandi of the traffickers has become the model for all criminal activity,\" says Luis Astorga, a sociologist well known for his work on drug culture in Mexico.</p> <p>But while the police investigation of such murders is often cursory, and media interest goes up and down, evidence of the cartel's influence in Juarez reaches far beyond the corpses it leaves in this border town.</p> <p>Irene Blanco, a former municipal employee, saw it develop in her wealthy barrio (suburb). \"We all knew who owned the new mansions being built when the [drugs] boom started and we enjoyed the new swanky restaurants, but nobody said anything,\" Ms Blanco says. \"We talked about television soap operas instead.\"</p> <p>Marijuana smuggling along the 2,000-mile Mexico-US border dates back to the 1920s and has always relied on the complicity of the authorities and local people, according to Mr Astorga.</p> <p>In the 1980s, the Juarez cartel formed to take advantage of the Colombian cocaine trafficking boom. It took off in the 1990s under Amado Carillo Fuentes, who was the undisputed boss from 1993 until he died during plastic surgery in July 1997. And although the bloody power struggle that followed has since abated, no one appears to have assumed control - a worry for Juarez's residents who know instability is fertile ground for violence.</p> <p>None of this deters Juarez's mayor, Gustavo Elizondo, from his crusade to improve the image of his city and, in particular, to persuade the authorities and the media to find another name for the Juarez cartel.</p> <p>He is particularly angry at the invasion by international media to report December's high-profile search by Mexican authorities and the FBI for the cartel's clandestine burial sites for its victims; the digging yielded nine bodies - far from initial reports that the so-called narco-cemeteries would surrender hundreds of bodies.</p> <p>\"There is a different face to Juarez,\" Mr Elizondo insists, pointing to the explosive growth of export assembly plants in recent years, a phenomenon that has turned the city into one of the few places in Mexico with nearly full employment.</p> <p>But for many it is not so easy to disassociate Juarez from its trafficking underworld. In Ms Blanco's words: \"The narco is like a ghost, intangible but constantly present.\"</p> <p>Cab driver Victor Sandoval says he is the only one in his group of drinking and dancing buddies who stays off the drugs. \"Just a few years ago a paper of cocaine cost about $30 [\u00a319] and it was a big luxury. Now it costs $5,\" he says.</p> <p>Mr Sandoval is more enthusiastic about the plummeting price of sex associated with the growing drug use. \"Before you had to pay about $100 [\u00a363] to sleep with a prostitute, but now you can have three women for that.\"</p> <p>Heroin is also beginning to make an impact in Juarez. Almost unheard of two years ago, the drug is very cheap at a few dollars a dose and easily available at the hundreds of \"little shops\" that have sprung up around the city.</p> <p>\"The authorities let it happen,\" says Alfredo Quijano, the news editor at the local daily paper, El Norte. Mr Quijano does not hesitate to blame corruption for the inaction.</p> <p>The assumption of corruption runs deep. Recent seiz ures of marijuana at the Juarez border were widely interpreted as moves to protect the territory of the local cartel against the Tijuana cartel's attempts to muscle in.</p> <p>Mr Sandoval says lower-level corruption is just as visible, recalling the day he drove a policeman around to a string of \"little shops\" selling illegal drugs. \"He was going to pick up his cut ... a taxi is noticed less than a patrol car,\" the cab driver explains.</p> <p>The mayor denies there is a problem in this regard. \"I have full confidence in all my officials,\" Mr Elizondo says, dismissing as \"totally unfounded\" persistent rumours questioning the honesty of senior police.</p> <p>Mr Elizondo insists he has made every effort to combat corruption linked to drug trafficking and claims to have dismissed 300 lower-ranking policemen in the past year. The mayor shows off a framed letter congratulating his administration from Washington's anti-drugs czar, Barry McCaffrey, and he blames the lapses in law enforcement on state and federal authorities.</p> <p>But Mr McCaffrey says that Mexico is the route for an estimated 55% of the illegal cocaine available in the US and a sizeable chunk of the marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.</p> <p>According to Mr Astorga, drug trafficking in the old days was a much simpler business, involving simple agreements between the traffickers, the government and the police. But the trafficking boom, a parallel increase in US pressure to crack down on the drugs trade and a weaker Mexican political establishment has resulted in periodic outbreaks of drug-related violence.</p> <p>\"The old mechanisms of control no longer work. It isn't that they have disappeared entirely, more that they have weakened and everybody has gone their own way,\" Mr Astorga said. \"Things have been feudalised.\"</p>",

It appeared to be just another \"settling of scores\" for the drug-trafficking underworld in the border city of Juarez, said the police official, Juan Manuel Carmona. His tone suggested that this killing was hardly worth noting. Juarez - a dusty, undistinguished city of 1.3m across the Rio Bravo river from El Paso, Texas - is home to one of Mexico's two main drug cartels; the other is based in Tijuana, just over the border from San Diego, California. There has been one killing a week on average in Juarez since the beginning of the year and even more in Tijuana. The execution style of a number of these murders has prompted reports of a turf war between the cartels. \"There is a subculture of violence in these zones. The modus operandi of the traffickers has become the model for all criminal activity,\" says Luis Astorga, a sociologist well known for his work on drug culture in Mexico. But while the police investigation of such murders is often cursory, and media interest goes up and down, evidence of the cartel's influence in Juarez reaches far beyond the corpses it leaves in this border town. Irene Blanco, a former municipal employee, saw it develop in her wealthy barrio (suburb). \"We all knew who owned the new mansions being built when the [drugs] boom started and we enjoyed the new swanky restaurants, but nobody said anything,\" Ms Blanco says. \"We talked about television soap operas instead.\" Marijuana smuggling along the 2,000-mile Mexico-US border dates back to the 1920s and has always relied on the complicity of the authorities and local people, according to Mr Astorga. In the 1980s, the Juarez cartel formed to take advantage of the Colombian cocaine trafficking boom. It took off in the 1990s under Amado Carillo Fuentes, who was the undisputed boss from 1993 until he died during plastic surgery in July 1997. And although the bloody power struggle that followed has since abated, no one appears to have assumed control - a worry for Juarez's residents who know instability is fertile ground for violence. None of this deters Juarez's mayor, Gustavo Elizondo, from his crusade to improve the image of his city and, in particular, to persuade the authorities and the media to find another name for the Juarez cartel. He is particularly angry at the invasion by international media to report December's high-profile search by Mexican authorities and the FBI for the cartel's clandestine burial sites for its victims; the digging yielded nine bodies - far from initial reports that the so-called narco-cemeteries would surrender hundreds of bodies. \"There is a different face to Juarez,\" Mr Elizondo insists, pointing to the explosive growth of export assembly plants in recent years, a phenomenon that has turned the city into one of the few places in Mexico with nearly full employment. But for many it is not so easy to disassociate Juarez from its trafficking underworld. In Ms Blanco's words: \"The narco is like a ghost, intangible but constantly present.\" Cab driver Victor Sandoval says he is the only one in his group of drinking and dancing buddies who stays off the drugs. \"Just a few years ago a paper of cocaine cost about $30 [\u00a319] and it was a big luxury. Now it costs $5,\" he says. Mr Sandoval is more enthusiastic about the plummeting price of sex associated with the growing drug use. \"Before you had to pay about $100 [\u00a363] to sleep with a prostitute, but now you can have three women for that.\" Heroin is also beginning to make an impact in Juarez. Almost unheard of two years ago, the drug is very cheap at a few dollars a dose and easily available at the hundreds of \"little shops\" that have sprung up around the city. \"The authorities let it happen,\" says Alfredo Quijano, the news editor at the local daily paper, El Norte. Mr Quijano does not hesitate to blame corruption for the inaction. The assumption of corruption runs deep. Recent seiz ures of marijuana at the Juarez border were widely interpreted as moves to protect the territory of the local cartel against the Tijuana cartel's attempts to muscle in. Mr Sandoval says lower-level corruption is just as visible, recalling the day he drove a policeman around to a string of \"little shops\" selling illegal drugs. \"He was going to pick up his cut ... a taxi is noticed less than a patrol car,\" the cab driver explains. The mayor denies there is a problem in this regard. \"I have full confidence in all my officials,\" Mr Elizondo says, dismissing as \"totally unfounded\" persistent rumours questioning the honesty of senior police. Mr Elizondo insists he has made every effort to combat corruption linked to drug trafficking and claims to have dismissed 300 lower-ranking policemen in the past year. The mayor shows off a framed letter congratulating his administration from Washington's anti-drugs czar, Barry McCaffrey, and he blames the lapses in law enforcement on state and federal authorities. But Mr McCaffrey says that Mexico is the route for an estimated 55% of the illegal cocaine available in the US and a sizeable chunk of the marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines. According to Mr Astorga, drug trafficking in the old days was a much simpler business, involving simple agreements between the traffickers, the government and the police. But the trafficking boom, a parallel increase in US pressure to crack down on the drugs trade and a weaker Mexican political establishment has resulted in periodic outbreaks of drug-related violence. \"The old mechanisms of control no longer work. It isn't that they have disappeared entirely, more that they have weakened and everybody has gone their own way,\" Mr Astorga said. \"Things have been feudalised.\"",

Major markets in tiger skin and bones are flourishing openly in Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Burma and Laos, according to the Worldwide Fund for Nature, which funded the report compiled by Traffic, a group which investigates trade in endangered species. The report says 66 Sumatran tigers have been killed in two years. While the worldwide trade in tiger bones for Chinese medicine has lessened, the market for curios and skins has increased. Stuart Chapman, head of WWF's wildlife trade programme, said: \"This new trend threatens to undermine the progress made in curtailing the use of tiger bone in Chinese medicines. \"We had hoped that declines of this magnitude were confined to history books, but the war against poaching and illegal trade rages on,\" he said. Pressure will be put on \"tiger trade\" states at the forthcoming meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species in Nairobi. \"The tiger is running out of time and governments out of excuses. This barbaric trade must end,\" Mr Chapman said.",

      "body": "<p>Life is far from sweet for Tate &amp; Lyle's investors - a profits warning sent the sugar group's shares tumbling to their lowest level for 10 years yesterday morning. </p> <p>They later recovered some ground, closing down 10p at 217p, but there was little comfort in the detail of the trading statement. </p> <p>Tate &amp; Lyle's biggest headache is in the United States, where the company said the sugar market has \"deteriorated significantly\" since November. </p> <p>Prices of beet and cane sugar are at their lowest point since 1979, following an unusually large harvest and an influx of cheap supply from Mexico. </p> <p>A swift recovery is unlikely - the American market has traditionally been heavily regulated, but there is a growing feeling that the system intended to keep prices steady is not working. Any liberalisation of the regime could depress prices further. </p> <p>Tate &amp; Lyle's response has been to begin a \"strategic review\" of the business, holding out the possibility of a withdrawal from US production. The problem is that buyers will be hard to find - the market is unattractive and unlikely to change in the near future. US sugar production is relatively small for Tate &amp; Lyle, comprising about 12% of its assets. </p> <p>However, it has joined a number of other factors in producing a somewhat sluggish performance. </p> <p>Low prices have meant a tough time for Tate's Australian operations and higher net corn costs have hit margins at Staley, the group's cereals and starch business. </p> <p>Tate &amp; Lyle is keen to concentrate on manufacturing operations where it can add value, such as Staley. These are less vulnerable to swings in commodity prices. </p> <p>In an unusually active period the group has made \u00a390m of disposals in the last six months. More are likely, and there is a chance of a return of cash to shareholders. </p> <p>But the climate is tricky - one analyst said: \"Any bad news from food companies is greeted with hostility, while good news is greeted with indifference.\" Broker ABN Amro cut its forecast for full-year profits from \u00a3216m to \u00a3200m, and tough times seem likely to continue.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Life is far from sweet for Tate &amp; Lyle's investors - a profits warning sent the sugar group's shares tumbling to their lowest level for 10 years yesterday morning. They later recovered some ground, closing down 10p at 217p, but there was little comfort in the detail of the trading statement. Tate &amp; Lyle's biggest headache is in the United States, where the company said the sugar market has \"deteriorated significantly\" since November. Prices of beet and cane sugar are at their lowest point since 1979, following an unusually large harvest and an influx of cheap supply from Mexico. A swift recovery is unlikely - the American market has traditionally been heavily regulated, but there is a growing feeling that the system intended to keep prices steady is not working. Any liberalisation of the regime could depress prices further. Tate &amp; Lyle's response has been to begin a \"strategic review\" of the business, holding out the possibility of a withdrawal from US production. The problem is that buyers will be hard to find - the market is unattractive and unlikely to change in the near future. US sugar production is relatively small for Tate &amp; Lyle, comprising about 12% of its assets. However, it has joined a number of other factors in producing a somewhat sluggish performance. Low prices have meant a tough time for Tate's Australian operations and higher net corn costs have hit margins at Staley, the group's cereals and starch business. Tate &amp; Lyle is keen to concentrate on manufacturing operations where it can add value, such as Staley. These are less vulnerable to swings in commodity prices. In an unusually active period the group has made \u00a390m of disposals in the last six months. More are likely, and there is a chance of a return of cash to shareholders. But the climate is tricky - one analyst said: \"Any bad news from food companies is greeted with hostility, while good news is greeted with indifference.\" Broker ABN Amro cut its forecast for full-year profits from \u00a3216m to \u00a3200m, and tough times seem likely to continue.",

Motorists, already unhappy about higher fuel prices, will be even less well disposed towards Gore if the rising cost of energy pushes up inflation in America's already overheating economy and forces the Federal Reserve into pushing up borrowing costs. </p> <p>More than anything else the White House needed to buy Gore time, and that is what yesterday's deal has probably done. But it may not have won him that long a breathing space, with Charles Dumas of Lombard Street Research warning yesterday that output would match \"global needs this spring, but will increasingly fall short of it from this summer, so that existing serious inventory shortages could worsen soon\". </p> <p>It remains to be seen whether oil prices will come back to haunt Gore just as the presidential campaign gets into full swing. Oil experts do not expect a dramatic drop in prices as a result of the deal struck in Vienna early yesterday, but they do not expect them to carry on rising, either. Crude prices have increased from a low of $10 barrel in early 1999 to more than $30 a few weeks ago, and are now expected to settle at around $20 to $25 a barrel - not so different in inflation adjusted terms from the price in aftermath of the first oil shock in 1973 to 1974. </p> <p>The price had already been softening in anticipation of an agreement, and most of the agreed increase in output has already taken place in recent months as Opec nations have exceded the quotas set in spring last year. </p> <p>According to the Centre for Global Energy Studies (CGES), Opec members are already overproducing by at least a million barrels a day, which means that the deal will only lead to extra production of fewer than half a million barrels a day. </p> <p>In reality the increase will be more than this because the one country that refused to sign up to the deal - Iran - is likely to raise output quietly once the dust has settled. Iran's objection to the Opec deal was not so much the impact on prices of raising quotas but of member states being pushed around by Washington. </p> <p>Extra output from Iran will push the increase in Opec production up to 1.7m bar rels a day - on paper, at least. But the CGES believes that on past form, countries will exceed their quotas by a further 300 to 400,000 barrels a day. This would result in an increase of production of around 2.1m barrels a day, or around 1.1m barrels more than is at present being produced. </p> <p>\"An output increase of 1.1m barrels per day from the beginning of April will not have a significant downward impact on oil prices, although it should prevent them from returning to the $30 a barrel level that we have witnessed recently.\" </p> <p>Even if non-Opec countries such as Mexico increase production - as they almost certainly will - the CGES estimates that demand will still slightly exceed supply this year because the global economy is on the mend. Margaret Thatcher, one of the politicians made by the energy crisis in the 1970s once famously said: \"You can't buck the market.\" Opec has proved that you can. But only up to a point.</p>",

But the US has already drawn down heavily on its reserves during the winter, and prices at the pump have started to rise sharply - just at the time demand is picking up for the summer \"driving season\" when Americans take to their gas-guzzling vehicles and head off into the wilds. Motorists, already unhappy about higher fuel prices, will be even less well disposed towards Gore if the rising cost of energy pushes up inflation in America's already overheating economy and forces the Federal Reserve into pushing up borrowing costs. More than anything else the White House needed to buy Gore time, and that is what yesterday's deal has probably done. But it may not have won him that long a breathing space, with Charles Dumas of Lombard Street Research warning yesterday that output would match \"global needs this spring, but will increasingly fall short of it from this summer, so that existing serious inventory shortages could worsen soon\". It remains to be seen whether oil prices will come back to haunt Gore just as the presidential campaign gets into full swing. Oil experts do not expect a dramatic drop in prices as a result of the deal struck in Vienna early yesterday, but they do not expect them to carry on rising, either. Crude prices have increased from a low of $10 barrel in early 1999 to more than $30 a few weeks ago, and are now expected to settle at around $20 to $25 a barrel - not so different in inflation adjusted terms from the price in aftermath of the first oil shock in 1973 to 1974. The price had already been softening in anticipation of an agreement, and most of the agreed increase in output has already taken place in recent months as Opec nations have exceded the quotas set in spring last year. According to the Centre for Global Energy Studies (CGES), Opec members are already overproducing by at least a million barrels a day, which means that the deal will only lead to extra production of fewer than half a million barrels a day. In reality the increase will be more than this because the one country that refused to sign up to the deal - Iran - is likely to raise output quietly once the dust has settled. Iran's objection to the Opec deal was not so much the impact on prices of raising quotas but of member states being pushed around by Washington. Extra output from Iran will push the increase in Opec production up to 1.7m bar rels a day - on paper, at least. But the CGES believes that on past form, countries will exceed their quotas by a further 300 to 400,000 barrels a day. This would result in an increase of production of around 2.1m barrels a day, or around 1.1m barrels more than is at present being produced. \"An output increase of 1.1m barrels per day from the beginning of April will not have a significant downward impact on oil prices, although it should prevent them from returning to the $30 a barrel level that we have witnessed recently.\" Even if non-Opec countries such as Mexico increase production - as they almost certainly will - the CGES estimates that demand will still slightly exceed supply this year because the global economy is on the mend. Margaret Thatcher, one of the politicians made by the energy crisis in the 1970s once famously said: \"You can't buck the market.\" Opec has proved that you can. But only up to a point.",

The former state-owned telecoms monopoly has the enviable position of one of the few telecommunications firms to boast a balance sheet free from debt. However, it is no match for the deep pockets of rivals like Vodafone and British Telecom. </p> <p>In fact, Eircom's \u00a36bn market cap may see it struggle to pay for a licence. It would have to undertake an additional huge spend on network infrastructure to deliver the next generation of mobile technology. </p> <p>Compounding this apparent weakness is the uncertainty over Eircom's share registry where big shareholders Dutch KPN and Sweden's Telia are planning to dispose of their respective 21% and 14% stakes. </p> <p>It means Eircom's shares could be in for a roller coaster ride with the prospect of more than a third of the company coming to the market - which raises even bigger questions of its becoming a takeover target. </p> <p>The company floated last July on the Irish, London and New York stock exchanges at \u20ac3.90 (\u00a32.40) and that price has only improved to \u20ac4.70 recently. </p> <p>Yet Eircom is still hanging in there with 12 other bidders. Bidding in the auction is part of Eircom's wider strategy to become a significant player in the Northern Irish and British telecom markets. Eircom has yet to realise this goal, remaining heavily reliant on the Irish fixed line network, which accounts for almost 90% of its sales. </p> <p>Only 44% of the Irish population has a fixed line phone and this is expected to be overtaken by mobile ownership next year. Now estimated at 43% of the population, it is likely to reach 61% by 2003. </p> <p>Finland is one of the few other European countries where mobiles are the dominant breed. </p> <p>Ireland's tiger economy - where gross domestic product has leaped ahead at 9% per annum - has helped underpin the revenues for Eircom's fixed line business. </p> <p>Yet this growth is at risk, as Eircom acknowledged this week in a statement that said: \"The impact of the company's new business development strategies and increased competition are expected to reduce earnings in the short term.\" </p> <p>BT has just bought Esat, Ireland's second largest telecom's operator, for \u00a31.6bn, and it is expected to make a grab for Eircom's business customers. </p> <p>Margins will no doubt fall and so Eircom is now looking at broadband opportunities, like the internet and interactive television, to exploit more revenues from its fixed line network of residential and business customers. </p> <p>Eircom boasts 200,000 internet surfers using its lines and has plans to spin them off into an internet division. Those internet users account for 27% of Eircom's local calls. </p> <p>Eircom's plans to offer its 1.6m customers high-speed internet access and interactive television via broadband are also under threat from NTL's Irish cable network, which intends to compete with high-speed data and telephony on its own network. </p> <p>These factors have kept Eircom's share price in check, restricting the rise since it listed to 20%. This lacklustre performance suggests the company has more battles to win than just a bidding competition for British mobile phone licences.</p>",

However, it is no match for the deep pockets of rivals like Vodafone and British Telecom. In fact, Eircom's \u00a36bn market cap may see it struggle to pay for a licence. It would have to undertake an additional huge spend on network infrastructure to deliver the next generation of mobile technology. Compounding this apparent weakness is the uncertainty over Eircom's share registry where big shareholders Dutch KPN and Sweden's Telia are planning to dispose of their respective 21% and 14% stakes. It means Eircom's shares could be in for a roller coaster ride with the prospect of more than a third of the company coming to the market - which raises even bigger questions of its becoming a takeover target. The company floated last July on the Irish, London and New York stock exchanges at \u20ac3.90 (\u00a32.40) and that price has only improved to \u20ac4.70 recently. Yet Eircom is still hanging in there with 12 other bidders. Bidding in the auction is part of Eircom's wider strategy to become a significant player in the Northern Irish and British telecom markets. Eircom has yet to realise this goal, remaining heavily reliant on the Irish fixed line network, which accounts for almost 90% of its sales. Only 44% of the Irish population has a fixed line phone and this is expected to be overtaken by mobile ownership next year. Now estimated at 43% of the population, it is likely to reach 61% by 2003. Finland is one of the few other European countries where mobiles are the dominant breed. Ireland's tiger economy - where gross domestic product has leaped ahead at 9% per annum - has helped underpin the revenues for Eircom's fixed line business. Yet this growth is at risk, as Eircom acknowledged this week in a statement that said: \"The impact of the company's new business development strategies and increased competition are expected to reduce earnings in the short term.\" BT has just bought Esat, Ireland's second largest telecom's operator, for \u00a31.6bn, and it is expected to make a grab for Eircom's business customers. Margins will no doubt fall and so Eircom is now looking at broadband opportunities, like the internet and interactive television, to exploit more revenues from its fixed line network of residential and business customers. Eircom boasts 200,000 internet surfers using its lines and has plans to spin them off into an internet division. Those internet users account for 27% of Eircom's local calls. Eircom's plans to offer its 1.6m customers high-speed internet access and interactive television via broadband are also under threat from NTL's Irish cable network, which intends to compete with high-speed data and telephony on its own network. These factors have kept Eircom's share price in check, restricting the rise since it listed to 20%. This lacklustre performance suggests the company has more battles to win than just a bidding competition for British mobile phone licences.",

Contenders have come and gone, but it's Higgs, curator of exhibitions including Then and Now at the Lisson Gallery and a director of London's Cabinet Gallery, who seems to be the man with a plan. And the reason that Higgs is a genuine influence is that he chose the right artists. Long before they attained their current fame, he worked closely with Ofili, Martin Creed, Fiona Banner, Jeremy Deller and Paul Noble. </p> <p>These are not just names to play with but are among the best artists at work in Britain now. Creed and Deller, in particular, could never have developed in the way they have without Higgs - and without them British art would be a bleak prospect. So Higgs is a success in the best possible way for an art critic or curator - he was right. His latest project is the British Art Show, a huge survey of current work organised every five years by the Hayward Gallery, which opens in Edinburgh on April 8. It's being spoken of as \"Matthew Higgs's British Art Show\", although he emphasises he's only one of three selectors, the others being freelance curator Pippa Coles and artist Jacqui Poncelet. But it is hard not to see Higgs's hand shaping the list of selected artists, which includes Creed, Billy Childish, Deller and Lucy MacKenzie. </p> <p>Lists again. A list is a very controlled literary form: the compiler may have a deeply emotional relationship to what is on it, or they may be joking. They are certainly not giving themselves away. Higgs is in his mid-30s, a dry character, hard to pin down. For him, art is \"a conversation\". He uses his curating to stress the value of collaboration and dialogue, in contrast to the single-minded art of the Hirst generation. Last year he staged an exhibition at the Anthony Wilkinson Gallery of his own works, which featured collaborations with friends. The effect was of a group show that he had curated rather than of a signature style by a single artist. He juxtaposed cut-up books made with Ofili and Peter Doig and - the most emotional item - a black-and-white photograph of himself with the legendary Manchester band Joy Division. Why did he include this? \"Because these four young men were about to change history and I was lucky enough to be there at the time.\" In the picture he's a mop-haired figure in the background; it's an uncanny thing to have in your photo collection. </p> <p>Higgs is from Chorley, Lancashire, and when he was 14 he founded a Joy Division fanzine, the beginning of his publishing enterprise. Joy Division led him to research groups like Throbbing Gristle and, through them, to conceptual art. He and his friends met and befriended Joy Division. The band's generosity to an awkward teenager had an openness he still can't get over. \"For whatever reason they took us seriously. That always strikes me as odd because at the time they were a significant presence on the British music scene and you'd have thought the last thing they'd want in their rehearsal studio was teenagers.\" </p> <p>When he started Imprint 93, Higgs says, he was trying to recapture this generous spirit, the sense he got from the group that what transpired in a light way between friends - a band rehearsal on a grey Manchester morning - could have a weight and significance. \"It was about trying to find that level of conversation again.\" </p> <p>Recently an art magazine asked 20 curators what they hope for in the art of this millennium. Another list. The only person who said anything interesting was Higgs. He pointed out that no art exhibition he saw in Britain last year was anywhere near as good as the American independent film Rushmore. This is a surprise coming from someone who makes his living promoting British art. But Higgs represents a completely different, far more sceptical, attitude from the one that prevailed in Britain in the 90s. The huge international success of British art has been simultaneous with the decline of British pop, as if art had swallowed up popular culture. The British artists of the Goldsmiths generation - \"the dying empire of the YBAs\", as Higgs calls them - came on like pop stars, but only to produce a spectacle. The epitome of this was Gavin Turk's statue of himself as Sid Vicious in an Elvis pose. What did this mean? That all icons are the same? To say that is to erase history, to feel nothing about music or what it means to people. </p> <p> Compare this with the pride Higgs takes in the photograph of himself with Joy Division. He likes the picture precisely because it puts him in history. Its meaning is absolutely connected with who Joy Division were and their place in British culture. Higgs has emerged as the spokesman of post-YBA art, a job that had many applicants, because he put his finger on what was wrong with the art of Gavin Turk and co - its obsession with the artist as a one-off voice. By contrast, the artists associated with Imprint 93 revel in multiple voices. Higgs is the leader and curator of a school of artists who have a positively studious relationship with popular culture. They don't see it as raw material to be ransacked, but a real history, a continuing story. I suppose you could accuse Higgs and his collaborators of being a bit adolescent.

      "body": "<p>No other artist epitomises the 80s quite like Phil Collins. In a way, he is the 80s: slick, capitalist, compromised. The 80s began... Phil Collins became Phil Collins. The 80s ended... Phil Collins immediately began to lose significance. In 1990 No Jacket Required, one of the fastest-selling new albums of all time in 1985, started to become the fastest-abandoned old album of all time, as vast chunks of the populace abruptly came to their sense and car-booted it into touch. I don't have the figures to prove this, of course, but my local second-hand record shop claims it was receiving 20 copies a week at one point during 1991, and these days No Jacket Required, alongside Supertramp's Breakfast in America and Rush's Grace under Pressure, doesn't even make it into the three-for-a-quid section. </p> <p>What turned us against Collins? Was it that he left his second wife and nicked off to Switzerland with a girl half his age? Was it the dreaded slaphead/mullet in-yer-face interface of the Live Aid era? Was it that he gradually drained all the artistic vision from Peter Gabriel's original model of Genesis, then walked out? Was it the gobsmackingly insulting video with the homeless that accompanied 1989's Another Day in Armani in the Lear Jet (Where's the Champagne, Slave?)? Or was it simply that you can only treat your audience like moronic, sentimental peasants for so long before they cotton on, even if they are moronic, sentimental peasants? </p> <p>Today Collins doesn't even qualify as an international pop antichrist, like Celine Dion, or a chintzy, ironic icon, like Barry Manilow. It's as if he was cryogenically frozen at the Knebworth Festival in 1990, along with his influence on popular music. It's only in the last couple of weeks, with an Academy Award for his Tarzan theme song, You'll Be In My Heart, and news of a forthcoming album of cover versions from rap and modern R&amp;B artists, and a royalties battle with the two surviving members of Earth, Wind and Fire, that we've been forced to acknowledge his continuing existence. Two groups of people, it seems, still care: the first lot are from Hollywood and not really worth worrying about. The second are a bigger concern. Surely an album of Collins covers should feature Gary Barlow, Bryan Adams, Jon Bon Jovi, Robbie Williams and Celine Dion - not Ol' Dirty Bastard, Montell Jordan, Li'l Kim and Dru Hill? </p> <p>Actually, while bitching, whoring gangsta rappers might not fit in with the suburban grandma's picture of \"that nice man Phil\", modern rap is more in sync with Collins's I-want-it-all-I-want-it-now-and-I-don't-care-what-I-have-to-sell-to-get-it aesthetic than any other musical genre. The Day Today's Chris Morris foresaw all this in 1993 with his homicidal wordsmith Fur-Q, who covered the Collins/Phil Everly duet Easy Lover as Uzi Lover, proving in the process how eminently sampleable Collins was. </p> <p>It's possible to see how an album of Collins covers might work. But this probably won't be it. Taken to a dank, abandoned warehouse, strip-searched, and well and truly worked over, it's possible to see how Turn It On Again, Sussudio or I Missed Again might be revealed as killer tunes dressed in travelling sales rep's clothing. But don't expect a rerun of Run DMC's Aerosmith makeover here. With rap ever more overproduced and sterile, we can only expect No Jacket Required remade as No Reebok Hi-Tops Required, with a bit more jewellery and misogyny. </p> <p>Will it sell? And if so, who to? As the last five years have proved, words like \"compromise\" and \"integrity\" aren't in mainstream rap audiences' lexicons, so don't expect them to be too worried about putting a few more royalties into the pocket of the man who once said he would leave the country if Old Labour got into power.

      "bodyText": "No other artist epitomises the 80s quite like Phil Collins. In a way, he is the 80s: slick, capitalist, compromised. The 80s began... Phil Collins became Phil Collins. The 80s ended... Phil Collins immediately began to lose significance. In 1990 No Jacket Required, one of the fastest-selling new albums of all time in 1985, started to become the fastest-abandoned old album of all time, as vast chunks of the populace abruptly came to their sense and car-booted it into touch. I don't have the figures to prove this, of course, but my local second-hand record shop claims it was receiving 20 copies a week at one point during 1991, and these days No Jacket Required, alongside Supertramp's Breakfast in America and Rush's Grace under Pressure, doesn't even make it into the three-for-a-quid section. What turned us against Collins? Was it that he left his second wife and nicked off to Switzerland with a girl half his age? Was it the dreaded slaphead/mullet in-yer-face interface of the Live Aid era? Was it that he gradually drained all the artistic vision from Peter Gabriel's original model of Genesis, then walked out? Was it the gobsmackingly insulting video with the homeless that accompanied 1989's Another Day in Armani in the Lear Jet (Where's the Champagne, Slave?)? Or was it simply that you can only treat your audience like moronic, sentimental peasants for so long before they cotton on, even if they are moronic, sentimental peasants? Today Collins doesn't even qualify as an international pop antichrist, like Celine Dion, or a chintzy, ironic icon, like Barry Manilow. It's as if he was cryogenically frozen at the Knebworth Festival in 1990, along with his influence on popular music. It's only in the last couple of weeks, with an Academy Award for his Tarzan theme song, You'll Be In My Heart, and news of a forthcoming album of cover versions from rap and modern R&amp;B artists, and a royalties battle with the two surviving members of Earth, Wind and Fire, that we've been forced to acknowledge his continuing existence. Two groups of people, it seems, still care: the first lot are from Hollywood and not really worth worrying about. The second are a bigger concern. Surely an album of Collins covers should feature Gary Barlow, Bryan Adams, Jon Bon Jovi, Robbie Williams and Celine Dion - not Ol' Dirty Bastard, Montell Jordan, Li'l Kim and Dru Hill? Actually, while bitching, whoring gangsta rappers might not fit in with the suburban grandma's picture of \"that nice man Phil\", modern rap is more in sync with Collins's I-want-it-all-I-want-it-now-and-I-don't-care-what-I-have-to-sell-to-get-it aesthetic than any other musical genre. The Day Today's Chris Morris foresaw all this in 1993 with his homicidal wordsmith Fur-Q, who covered the Collins/Phil Everly duet Easy Lover as Uzi Lover, proving in the process how eminently sampleable Collins was. It's possible to see how an album of Collins covers might work. But this probably won't be it. Taken to a dank, abandoned warehouse, strip-searched, and well and truly worked over, it's possible to see how Turn It On Again, Sussudio or I Missed Again might be revealed as killer tunes dressed in travelling sales rep's clothing. But don't expect a rerun of Run DMC's Aerosmith makeover here. With rap ever more overproduced and sterile, we can only expect No Jacket Required remade as No Reebok Hi-Tops Required, with a bit more jewellery and misogyny. Will it sell? And if so, who to? As the last five years have proved, words like \"compromise\" and \"integrity\" aren't in mainstream rap audiences' lexicons, so don't expect them to be too worried about putting a few more royalties into the pocket of the man who once said he would leave the country if Old Labour got into power. But Phil's hordes? That's a tricky one. After the great spiritual cleansing of the early 90s, residual Collins fans seem to come in three guises: reformed, hiding or crackpot. A few hours on the net, and you learn that the average Collins fan is called Mad Norman, works part-time designing bombs, thinks Peter Gabriel is a \"bit weird\" and was drawn to Genesis in the mid-80s by the prominence of their drum sound and their lighting arrangements.

      "body": "<p>So, Joy Brook succumbed to the gender police in the end. But it was not so much a fair cop as proof of society's reluctance to abolish the sexuality caste system. </p> <p>Only a year ago the actor who plays WDC Kerry Holmes in The Bill put a spring in the step of female sexual renegades everywhere by declaring that she was a bisexual in an interview for the Guardian women's page. Last weekend she recanted by announcing that she's not a bisexual at all. No, siree. She is totally, utterly, 100%, not-even-if-Uma-Thurman-was-winched-down-naked-on-top-of-her certain that she is a heterosexual. </p> <p>\"I'll never fall in love with a woman again,\" she pledged to the Mail On Sunday. Miss Brook has become engaged to a man called Russell Boulter who plays DS John Boulton in The Bill. Not only is Mr Boulter not a lesbian but he is also a \"committed Christian\". </p> <p>The most intriguing part of the news came when Brook insisted that, although she shared a house with her female lover for two years, \"I fell in love with her and her personality, not what she was physically.\" Has a touch of the Kenny Everetts about it, doesn't it? \"There I was, lying in bed with another woman - and suddenly all my clothes fell off!\" </p> <p>What does she mean she fell in love with her girlfriend's personality? When she was under the covers pressing against a hot, silky, aroused woman's body was she thinking about her girlfriend's insightful views on Rosa Luxemburg? And what about 10 years down the line when Mr Boulton is more interested in the football scores than he is in coming to bed early? What will she do if an image of a comely nude female in a red sports car suddenly pops into her mind? Is she going to stroke her wedding dress for reassurance? </p> <p>Apart from the fatuous implication that women - still - don't have a sex drive of their own, one of the more shocking assumptions of Joy Brook's new philosophy on life is that despite our modern lives being haunted by training shoe slogans of the \"dare to be different\" variety, we apparently all become reactionary and frightened after the age of 21. </p> <p>Both Brook's before and after revelations are infused with the idea that she was young and therefore foolish when she had her first relationship with a woman. \"It was scary at first,\" she says, \"but when you're 21, you think, why not?\" As if two women sleeping together is on a par with devil worship, glue sniffing or wearing boob tubes. Naturally, many of Brook's words speak of internalised homophobia. And that is not illogical. </p> <p>Brook puts the problem succinctly in her original coming-out interview. \"I know a lot of actresses who, if not 100% gay, are bisexual,\" she says. \"But it's a difficult situation because it's still a business run by men. They want to be able to fancy you and they can only do that if they feel you could fancy them.\" </p> <p>For \"business run by men\" read planet earth. There is no big secret as to why women are less allowed to experiment with their sexuality than men do. The old chestnut that second wave feminism dug up in the 1970s remains the same ugly old chestnut in the 21st century: men feel threatened by women who - sexually and emotionally - are solely interested in women. Today, such a sentiment is as unfashionable as the concept of the \"wage slave\" or the \"all property is theft\" notion. But there, it is said now. </p> <p>And how do men punish women who dare upset the hetero applecart? Why, they extract the woman on woman concept, they water it down, eroticise it, fashionise it and turn it into a lot of old nonsense. They have the money to do it. Have you seen that new Dior handbag ad, for goodness sake? Two posh, sweaty girls getting it on with some sort of satchel flying around in the background. Whatever next? Lucy Clayton introducing pussy-bumping chic into her deportment classes? </p> <p>The last time there was such a rush for straight girls to become fly-by-night lesbians was in the 1970s when the discontent with heterosexuality was all part of a political battle. Today's men have a vested interest in creating fake lesbians because they can make money from them. Of course, such sexuality appropriation doesn't happen to gay men - because they are men. They get queer-bashed instead. Besides, why should gay men even bother saying they are bisexual when they have had the money to turn \"gay\" (meaning male homosexual) into a brand name as established and cool as Gucci, Absolut or Sony? </p> <p>The trouble with the concept I termed \"bi-try\" is that it is now being used to sell the kind of magazines which are, in fact, only interested in propping up the old regime of heterosexuality. (If being straight is so \"natural\", by the way, why are we so constantly coerced into believing in it?) </p> <p>Take this month's Elle cover story on \"Bi-try babes\". One writer claims she was \"uncomfortable with the idea of being a lesbian. It made me think of smelly old women living with 10 cats.\" See? Nobody at a deep level really fell for any of that fashion/\"lesbian chic\" stuff; the propaganda campaign that worked the best of all was the dungarees/fat/cat one. No wonder she never made any more forays into her sexuality. Both Evans' and Joy Brook's sense of what it is to be a woman seems to be so feeble that they can't take any other vision on board apart from some man-made image. And Girl Power was supposed to have sorted all that out, remember? So, what is this basic threat that men feel about women who balk at exclusive heterosexuality? What other chestnuts can we come up with? Could it be primal rage at maternal absence? Anger at mothers turning them on as children? Feelings of invalidation? Fury that not every woman is at their behest? If we knew the answer to that, one friend recently told me, we could bottle it and sell it. Except that the only people who would want to buy it are feminists and they don't have any money.</p>",

Apart from the fatuous implication that women - still - don't have a sex drive of their own, one of the more shocking assumptions of Joy Brook's new philosophy on life is that despite our modern lives being haunted by training shoe slogans of the \"dare to be different\" variety, we apparently all become reactionary and frightened after the age of 21. Both Brook's before and after revelations are infused with the idea that she was young and therefore foolish when she had her first relationship with a woman. \"It was scary at first,\" she says, \"but when you're 21, you think, why not?\" As if two women sleeping together is on a par with devil worship, glue sniffing or wearing boob tubes. Naturally, many of Brook's words speak of internalised homophobia. And that is not illogical. Brook puts the problem succinctly in her original coming-out interview. \"I know a lot of actresses who, if not 100% gay, are bisexual,\" she says. \"But it's a difficult situation because it's still a business run by men. They want to be able to fancy you and they can only do that if they feel you could fancy them.\" For \"business run by men\" read planet earth. There is no big secret as to why women are less allowed to experiment with their sexuality than men do. The old chestnut that second wave feminism dug up in the 1970s remains the same ugly old chestnut in the 21st century: men feel threatened by women who - sexually and emotionally - are solely interested in women. Today, such a sentiment is as unfashionable as the concept of the \"wage slave\" or the \"all property is theft\" notion. But there, it is said now. And how do men punish women who dare upset the hetero applecart? Why, they extract the woman on woman concept, they water it down, eroticise it, fashionise it and turn it into a lot of old nonsense. They have the money to do it. Have you seen that new Dior handbag ad, for goodness sake? Two posh, sweaty girls getting it on with some sort of satchel flying around in the background. Whatever next? Lucy Clayton introducing pussy-bumping chic into her deportment classes? The last time there was such a rush for straight girls to become fly-by-night lesbians was in the 1970s when the discontent with heterosexuality was all part of a political battle. Today's men have a vested interest in creating fake lesbians because they can make money from them. Of course, such sexuality appropriation doesn't happen to gay men - because they are men. They get queer-bashed instead. Besides, why should gay men even bother saying they are bisexual when they have had the money to turn \"gay\" (meaning male homosexual) into a brand name as established and cool as Gucci, Absolut or Sony? The trouble with the concept I termed \"bi-try\" is that it is now being used to sell the kind of magazines which are, in fact, only interested in propping up the old regime of heterosexuality. (If being straight is so \"natural\", by the way, why are we so constantly coerced into believing in it?) Take this month's Elle cover story on \"Bi-try babes\". One writer claims she was \"uncomfortable with the idea of being a lesbian. It made me think of smelly old women living with 10 cats.\" See? Nobody at a deep level really fell for any of that fashion/\"lesbian chic\" stuff; the propaganda campaign that worked the best of all was the dungarees/fat/cat one. No wonder she never made any more forays into her sexuality. Both Evans' and Joy Brook's sense of what it is to be a woman seems to be so feeble that they can't take any other vision on board apart from some man-made image. And Girl Power was supposed to have sorted all that out, remember? So, what is this basic threat that men feel about women who balk at exclusive heterosexuality? What other chestnuts can we come up with? Could it be primal rage at maternal absence? Anger at mothers turning them on as children? Feelings of invalidation? Fury that not every woman is at their behest? If we knew the answer to that, one friend recently told me, we could bottle it and sell it. Except that the only people who would want to buy it are feminists and they don't have any money.",

      "body": "<p>The problem</p> <p>After a major reorganisation, our chief executive is retiring and this has created a lot of uncertainty and dramatically lowered morale. Two people (out of a staff of 20) have already handed in their notices and more are attending interviews. Since the reorganisation, my role has been undermined and I am no longer performing many of the functions which I was employed for.</p> <p>I report directly to the chief executive and I am nervous that my role may change permanently if I do not act to stop it. </p> <p><strong>The solution</strong></p> <p>This is a classic case of an organisation's poor management of change. However, there is not an awful lot you can do to safeguard your position, which is why so many of your colleagues are looking to leave. Although an employer cannot legally change the terms of your contract (which is effectively what they are doing if you are no longer doing the job you were employed to do) without negotiation with you, they could argue that it is reasonable for your job role to change. For instance, the reorganisation may mean that some of your former tasks are no longer necessary and thus you are having to perform different ones.</p> <p>You don't have much choice but to put up with it. Had you been there more than one year, you could, in theory, have left and tried to claim constructive dismissal, but even then this would have been hard to prove. All you can do is to try and negotiate with the new chief exec as and when he or she is appointed.

      "bodyText": "The problem After a major reorganisation, our chief executive is retiring and this has created a lot of uncertainty and dramatically lowered morale. Two people (out of a staff of 20) have already handed in their notices and more are attending interviews. Since the reorganisation, my role has been undermined and I am no longer performing many of the functions which I was employed for. I report directly to the chief executive and I am nervous that my role may change permanently if I do not act to stop it. The solution This is a classic case of an organisation's poor management of change. However, there is not an awful lot you can do to safeguard your position, which is why so many of your colleagues are looking to leave. Although an employer cannot legally change the terms of your contract (which is effectively what they are doing if you are no longer doing the job you were employed to do) without negotiation with you, they could argue that it is reasonable for your job role to change. For instance, the reorganisation may mean that some of your former tasks are no longer necessary and thus you are having to perform different ones. You don't have much choice but to put up with it. Had you been there more than one year, you could, in theory, have left and tried to claim constructive dismissal, but even then this would have been hard to prove. All you can do is to try and negotiate with the new chief exec as and when he or she is appointed. You will need to use all your impression management, communication and negotiating skills to try and convince the new boss that what you were doing before will work just as well now. Whilst I rarely recommend my own books, Psychology Goes to Work could help you with this. If, at the end of the day, it all goes pear-shaped, I advise you to hang on in there for another year and then start looking to leave like your colleagues. But, you never know, your new boss might sing from the same hymn book as you. Dr Sandi Mann is author of Psychology Goes To Work and Hiding What We Feel, Faking What We Don't",

He brought abrasiveness to the surrounding pastoral texture and conjured up a nightmarish vision of the evil resident in every fairy tale. By Lynne Dawson's rapt solo in the fourth movement, Zander had completed an epic emotional journey.

Every disconcerting melodic transformation and jarring shift of orchestral perspective was captured by Zander and an inspired Philharmonia. Leader James Clark's garish, diabolical solo in the second movement, on an instrument tuned a tone too high, was the most emphatic revelation of Mahler's Janus-like personality. He brought abrasiveness to the surrounding pastoral texture and conjured up a nightmarish vision of the evil resident in every fairy tale. By Lynne Dawson's rapt solo in the fourth movement, Zander had completed an epic emotional journey. Motifs from the first movement, which had been tokens of ambivalence and tainted experience, reappeared as objects of sensuous, unfettered joy.",

Two other City players, Neil Lennon and Stuart Campbell, will receive personal hearings on April 11.",

      "body": "<p>There are three photographs. Each show a bloody corpse. One man has gunshot injuries, the other has had his throat cut. Another is a gruesome picture of a dead baby. Abdul Majeed fingers the photographs slowly, explaining what happened to these members of his family at home in Sri Lanka.</p> <p>There is a pile of manila folders on the 36-year-old's lap containing documents that detail the life he escaped from. There are x-rays of his dislocated right arm which he says was as a result of torture. There is his brother's death certificate and Majeed's complaint to the Sri Lankan human rights commission. There is even a police report detailing the grenade attack on his family home last December.</p> <p>Majeed (not his real name) is a Tamil Muslim from Sri Lanka's eastern province. Now, he is sitting in a chilly flat in a 20-storey tower block in the north of Glasgow. He and his wife and two children have lived in the Sighthill housing scheme for two weeks after being dispersed to Scotland from a hotel in Hastings where they shared one room. They were moved to Glasgow when a doctor said the hotel food did not agree with Majeed, who has diabetes and hypertension.</p> <p>The family - wife Fathima, son Husain, four, and daughter Munsifa, 15 months - have a freshly painted, two bedroom flat. There is a check print sofa, armchairs, dining table, lampshades, washing machine, beds with fat duvets, an iron and board: all new.</p> <p><b> Relieve the strain</b><br></p> <p>The Majeeds are part of a first wave of refugees sent to Glasgow as part of an interim arrangement made by the government ahead of next week's planned dispersal of asylum seekers. It is hoped that this and further dispersals will relieve the strain refugees are putting on the London boroughs and Kent.</p> <p>The plan was going smoothly until a group of Romanian women were caught begging in the douce suburb of Bishopbriggs. After discovering that some Romanian families were in breach of restrictions ordering them to report to a police station in London, Glasgow city council bussed them back to Wandsworth and postponed any further dispersals. Last Friday, after negotiation with the London Asylum Seekers Consortium, Glasgow said it would resume the programme and would accept a total of 600 refugees in the city.</p> <p>That number will increase by another 2,500 after the city's ruling Labour group yesterday agreed to increase its intake. The first 50 families will travel to Glasgow today. There are 60 refugee families in Sighthill at the moment. Many of the new arrivals expressed unease when they saw the strict security system at the bottom of each of the tower blocks. All closed circuit cameras and entry codes, they thought they were being committed to some high-rise prison. Now, they lock their doors from the inside.</p> <p>As Majeed looks out of his fifth floor window, he can see why people are scared. The north of Glasgow is its poorest part, it holds areas of multiple deprivation such as Sighthill and has problems with alcoholism, drug addiction, crime, unemployment and boredom: trouble that many residents would love to seek asylum from themselves.</p> <p>The scheme has 10 high rise blocks, each as wide as two traditional multi storeys. Built during 1964-1969 on the soda wastes of the old St Rollox chemical works, Sighthill sits just below the cemetery of the same name. In The Buildings of Scotland: Glasgow, Sighthill, is described as a \"singularly unpropitious site\".</p> <p>It says: \"From a distance the scheme, with its slab blocks ranged in parallel, resembles the utopian illustration that was no doubt in the architect's mind. Close to, the brutalism of the concrete construction is revealed: hammered concrete panels, huge pebble aggregate and slatted screens to the drying areas.\" Like other high rise schemes, Sighthill suffers from poor planning and a lack of amenities. It is a miserable, grey, windlashed place. \"Just you wait till you catch the wind whipping round the corners,\" warns one of the scheme's concierges. \"You'll never feel a wind like it.\"</p> <p>It is to here that the majority of refugees will come. Majeed does not mind. He says he has been warned that some of the children here might be a little rough. He will just have to be careful and quietly go about the business of finding some kind of life here. After all, he paid an agent around \u00a39,000 to get here, or at least anywhere that was not Sri Lanka.</p> <p>\"This is not so bad. The flat is very small but we are happy here,\" he explains. Asked what the family do all day, the former medical student says: \"Nothing, we stay in the flat, we cannot do anything. We have lost our life and I am losing my time.\" Just as it is with Sighthill's original population, boredom is in abundance for the new one. For most asylum seekers, getting a television is a big concern: it can help with the language and is something to do.</p> <p>But it is the sight of TVs being carried into the tower blocks that winds up other Sighthill tenants. \"They walk in and out with new televisions. Where do they get the money for tellies? And how are they going to pay their licence fee?\" asked a man outside the Sighthill post office.</p> <p>The asylum seekers are given cash every week which means they can buy whatever they want. Majeed would rather buy a television with this week's money and scrimp on food. \"My boy asks me for a television all the time. What am I supposed to do?\"</p> <p><b> \u00a3300 a week</b><br></p> <p>Every week asylum seekers traipse over to Sighthill youth centre where they wait in line to pick up their payment. They do not get vouchers because Glasgow refused to become involved in something that was \"so demeaning\". Instead, the council gets \u00a3300 per family per week which will change to \u00a3220 a week for families dispersed under the government's new scheme (they will get vouchers).</p> <p>David Comley, the city's housing director and chairman of the Scottish Asylum Seekers Consortium, says Glasgow has always had a tradition of accommodating refugees. But it is not just a spirit of generosity that has persuaded the council to participate. It could make some money.</p> <p>\"We are able to help because we have more houses than there is demand for. That's obviously a different situation than in the majority of London boroughs,\" says Comley. \"It benefits the council in financial terms. What it gives us is council tax and rent with no collection charges and no arrears and a lot of that is for property we probably wouldn't be able to let. We are not going to make money on this because we obviously have to provide services for asylum seekers.\"</p> <p>But it is the provision of services and furniture that provokes the anger of neighbours. Paula Hinton is 28 and lives in a block in the scheme's Pinkston Drive with her four-year-old son Darren. She is unhappy about the presence of asylum seekers. \"I think it is ridiculous, they are everywhere,\" she says. \"They are getting all the money spent on them and I get \u00a385 a week for me and Darren. They are getting furnished flats and we have to buy everything and that's what people are angry about, the fact that they get everything brand new. Would we get that if we went to their community?\"</p> <p>Her friend, Ann Marie MacDonald, is more calm: \"It's not the fact that they are here. The government is doing an awful lot for other folk but there's a lot of deprivation in our own country. What about all the homeless people we have got?\"</p> <p>Ms Hinton is furious that the refugees' flats are fixed quickly, that she has had to wait four years for a new door to her drying area. And Darren's window is still broken; \"he has got asthma and his room is full of dampness\".</p> <p>Her friend adds: \"Take a look around here and nobody is doing anything for us. I have no objection to them personally, they haven't asked to be brought here. But they should be putting us first before them. They have all been through an awful lot and it's not that that people are getting at. It's the principle. It's the fact that there's people here with needs. Did they put them here because it's a poor, poverty-stricken area?\"</p> <p>That mixture of welcome and resentment is similar to the one experienced by Oscar Mendoza, a Chilean refugee who arrived in Glasgow in 1975 when he fled Pinochet's regime after being tortured.</p> <p>In a recent letter to the Herald newspaper, he said: \"All of us experienced a mixture of warm and friendly welcome from some people, mainly those who knew the background to the end of democracy in Chile and supported our struggle against the regime, and hostility, mostly with racist and xenophobic overtones. Not much has changed, apparently.\"</p> <p>Such obvious anxieties in the local community made Sighthill a target last week for the smart-suited members of the British National party, who leafleted the estate. They were soon chased out by the concierges. There are four concierge stations across the scheme, each with half a dozen television screens which hold lots of smaller images from the CCTV cameras outside. Allan Syme, the senior concierge, says he tries to help the asylum seekers but communication difficulties mean they often end up playing a game of charades.</p> <p>It is often easy to pick out the asylum seekers. You can spot them at Huntingdon Square, the cluster of graffiti ridden, shuttered-up boxes that is the area's main shopping centre. Here, some of the shelves of the U-Save supermarket are bare. Like many poor areas, the selection of fresh fruit and vegetables available is dreadful and many refugees walk to the cut-price LIDL store for a marginally better range. The manager there, Dave Carey, says there has been an increase in the sale of fresh goods, health foods and yoghurts. Carey does not mind the asylum seekers but the boy on the till turns up his nose. \"I hate them,\" he says. \"They shouldnae be here in my opinion.\"</p> <p><b> School problem</b><br></p> <p>This attitude is a worry for parents sending their children out from behind locked doors and into the classrooms in Glasgow. The newest will go to local schools after the Easter holidays. The city's previous batches of refugee children attended a bilingual education unit but as a result of the massive increase in numbers this will not be possible. Extra staff will be employed and children will be integrated. They will not be taught English as a separate subject but will learn it through the general curriculum.</p> <p>Maggie Innes is headteacher at the bilingual support unit for primary children in Glasgow's west end. \"Because of the numbers that will be coming in we are hoping to set up classes within the local schools in the areas where they will be living,\" she explains. \"How they cope depends very much on the child's educational and emotional background and what they have been through. With some children, their learning process has been slowed up. But when they come to school they become more relaxed and happy.\"</p> <p>Some of the same children can be found playing on the landings of Sighthill and the neighbouring Red Road flats. They seem to be happy. A number of Kosovan refugees have been in Glasgow for almost a year now and have settled in well.</p> <p>The Avdyli family arrived last September and live on the 29th floor of Red Road. Their flat is more homely than those of the new refugees; they have a calendar on the wall, a TV, a PC and tiny little cups for coffee. \"When I first came to Glasgow from London I had to accept it, whatever it was,\" said Ramiz Avdyli, 52, who had been a finance director in Kosovo. \"Now I have been here quite a long time I am impressed, especially by the people .\"</p> <p>Like Majeed and most refugees, they want to remain.

But the Home Office said that though they were expected to mount patrols, their main role was protecting the refugees rather than preventing them from getting out.",

The \u00a323.5m signing from Arsenal was suspended by Real Madrid for 45 days when he refused to appear at training for three days; he had taken exception to an order to practise alone after criticising tactics. \"I ask for forgiveness. I'm aware that a sanction from the club is suitable. Given the matches facing the club at the present time I am making myself available if required, and I accept the sanction.\" Anelka, who read from a prepared statement while sitting alongside a club director, was not allowed to field questions but nodded sheepishly when asked if he hoped to play against United. Real will have to do so without their top scorer Fernando Morientes and their key defender Fernando Hierro, both injured.",

Responding to the \"virtual forum\" on parenting policy tomorrow, the first e-consultation between a government and its citizens in Europe, home secretary Jack Straw will acknowledge that parents rejected any government moves to tell them how to bring up their children. Partifcipants on the newly revamped Downing Street website expressed concern that information should not be forced on \"the vast majority of caring, competent parents in this country\". Some suspected that the option of a parenting website, also floated in the consultation, would merely allow the distribution of government \"propaganda\". Others felt that the government should not be giving lessons on parenting at all, warning that there was \"a fine line between genuine concern for the people and setting up a nanny state\". The government asked for answers on if and how parents would like to receive parenting advice, and suggested using the child benefit database to send parents information direct to their home address. However, ministers will still consider the option - welcomed by some of those responding - of using the database merely to let families know what information is available and where. Mr Straw, who chairs the ministerial group on the family, will say: \"Government should provide to parents, and how that information should be delivered.

      "body": "<p> <strong>Anthony Dymoke Powell, CH, author, born December 21, 1905; died March 28 2000</strong></p> <p>Anthony Powell is inevitably regarded as the English Proust, on the strength of the massive novel sequence - A Dance to the Music of Time, 12 volumes, a million words - that became his central life's work. The Proust impact was more dominant and more obvious than that of other great European novelists (such as the Austrian novelist Robert Musil) and assorted influences from Petronius to modern Americans he has himself mentioned.</p> <p>Yet he will stand as essentially a comic writer in the English tradition - comic in the least uproarious way imaginable, reflective and often melancholy, the strong social spine to his work being the one distinctively uncommon feature in a branch of writing remarkable more for eccentricity than togetherness.</p> <p>In fact Powell has a measure of both. He goes in for no deep psychological dredging, yet his novels rest on a firmer base of instinct and belief than is usual among the English comedians. He is fascinated by the play of time and chance on character, and it is by no means time and chance that always win. His narrating hero and anchor-man, Nicholas Jenkins, is constantly being mildly surprised by the way things and people turn out.</p> <p>The unpredictability of life, as Powell has himself described, is built into his structure as an essential part of it. Coincidences, so irritating to some readers, often happen in life so why should they be forbidden to fiction? They are not excluded from Powell's novels, nor are all manner of trivia other writers might scorn or mishandle. It was his belief that with the right cook in charge anything could go into the cauldron. A novelist never lacks material - only the capacity and energy to handle it.</p> <p>Silver spoons, in the Powell kitchen, were never short. The world he deals with, upper middle-class life from the 1920s onward, is his own world. The son and grandson of distinguished soldiers, at Eton he was a contemporary of Orwell. He went on to Balliol, married Lady Violet Pakenham in 1934, served in the Intelligence Corps during the second world war, lived in a handsome regency house near Frome, belonged to good clubs. He worked for a time as a publisher's reader and as literary editor of Punch.</p> <p>His first novel, Afternoon Men, appeared in 1931 and there were several others by way of prelude, followed by a long silence through and for some years after the war. Then, in 1951, came the start of the Music of Time sequence, the title deriving from Nicolas Poussin's allegorical painting. The books emerged at roughly two-yearly intervals.</p> <p>The twelve-volume sequence, stretching across a quarter of a century from A Question of Upbringing (1951) to Hearing Secret Harmonies (1975) is more than a successful fictional marathon. It achieves a coherence, a central vitality which runs sluggishly at times but is never extinguished. His vast army of characters, clubmen all, pursue their power-games through peace and war, marriage or divorce, in sickness and in health. War - as memorably described in the ninth volume, The Military Philosophers - is for Powell-people an extension of ordinary life; the flow is diverted but not stemmed, and rank is merely a crude token of what always existed in this elegantly competitive world. Some characters may only be glimpsed before disappearing from view, perhaps springing up like blades of grass in another volume years later. But nothing is lost or without its effect on the total pattern, while the allegorical master of the dance - as in the Poussin picture - smiles a shade malignly. Other characters are as perennial as the unreliable Dicky Umfraville, often in hot or at least very warm water, first noted leaving school under a cloud (not actually expelled, it was insisted) and last seen masquerading as an octogenarian drug-addict. Or the ever-indulgent Lady Molly, whose house in South Kensington, more than the Ritz, is really open to all.</p> <p>With Powell's known writing method and this roving cast of hundreds there was naturally much speculation about who were the originals, in whole or more usually in part, of the characters appearing in the Dance. Sometimes the guess-who game was easy, as with the well-known Fitzrovian writer and reviewer Julian Maclaren-Ross who became the character X. Trapnel. He appears as a novelist who holds forth at length about the art of the novel to the narrator Jenkins, also a novelist. He insists, and Jenkins doesn't contradict, that naturalism is only natural in the right hands and that reading novels takes almost as much talent as writing them. It can hardly be carrying presumption too far to assume that some of these ideas, as from novelist to novelist, are shared by the club's founding member, Powell himself. Others are more mysterious. Above all - literally so, if he had his way - there is the preposterous, the ever-haunting Widmerpool. Writhing with self-contradiction - a shade pathetic, a little absurd, more than a little sinister - he pervades the book, occupying a full half-century even of Powell's ocean of time. Where can this strange creature have sprung from?</p> <p>\"I am perpetually badgered about Widmerpool,\" Powell said when he was being interviewed for his 80th birthday. All sorts of orginals have been suggested, from a recent Lord Chancellor down. Actually, so far as the character was drawn from life, \"he was drawn from somebody I served under during the war.\"If any character was going to beat time you felt it would have to be the apparently indestructible Widmerpool, but he goes in the end - suitably weirdly, collapsing (as it seems) on a ritual jog at dawn.</p> <p>The inextricable mingling, in such a world as Powell's, of life and literature is made doubly apparent in the memoirs, To Keep the Ball Rolling, which Powell brought out in four volumes between 1976 and 1982. So happily do fact and fiction marry that it is easy to forget at times that you are reading about a real character in an actual place, and imagine you have slipped back into one of the novels.</p> <p>This reaction is particularly strong in the account - laconic and uninhibited like the fiction - of the early days in London when Jenkins is finding his feet in the literary world. The real-life memories develop, as the novels do, a sense of the significance of trivial and seemingly casual events, while large ones may pass invisibly by. Real people surge on to the scene like figures from a fantasy world: Augustus John, J. C. Squire, Rosa Lewis of the Cavendish, Maclean and Burgess (\"a notorious scallywag\"), the seedy diabolist Aleister Crowley at Simpson's, Tallulah Bankhead in a nightclub.</p> <p>We watch him becoming a Territorial recruit in the Royal Artillery (\"I felt that if the gunners were good enough for Tolstoy they were good enough for me\") and, rather more dangerously, pursuing a friendship with Evelyn Waugh. There are drinks with Sitwells. The air of clubbishness, a cool, bookish intimacy, persists. Most of the way, that is. Just once in a while togetherness fails: \"In the flat below mine lived E. M. Forster (a writer whose books have never greatly appealed to me), but we never met.\"</p> <p>The trivia of the memoirs can be as funny as anything in the novels and that means very funny indeed. Powell was of the opinion that most important writers, unlike most critics, have been well equipped with resources of humour; he even seems to have regarded it as a touchstone in evaluating them.</p> <p>Powell began as a writer for addicts - clubmen too, members of the Powell Club - but they increased rapidly. Or was it more like an open prison, in which Powell was governor and his readers were condemned to life sentences? They never wanted to be anywhere else for long, and they always came back at call.</p> <p>For a single writer to have put such a stamp on his day, and against the prevailing mood and style of the time, is a huge achievement. Powell didn't stand quite alone. Kingsley Amis was with him, dealing bold strokes in defence of the comic spirit; but the Amis comedy, though by no means all belly-laughs, was of a rougher order and failed to carry the approval of the bookish establishment. While Amis sold books, Powell won praise. It was ungrudging and well-earned.</p> <p>Largely it was a triumph of tone. A fastidious satirist, he never shouts and seldom mocks - or (except in the physical sense) moves very far. Powell's ideal hunting-ground seems a mile square and an inch deep, and there are bound to be some - particularly when so little, for such long spells, manages to happen - who get to find the inflexibly well-bred narrative voice a shade wearing. This is surely part of the fun. Powell's descriptive powers are clinically accurate and searching, and he is constantly putting himself in the way of good material. He is a conscientious mixer in the interests of his profession. It goes beyond clubland and the haunts of off-duty politicians, bureaucrats and important artists, though even lower life has its standards and good manners survive in unlikely places. Powell's world is well supplied with pubs without being beery, and there are times when the streets are thronged with well-born paupers conscientiously dodging their creditors. In taxis, of course.</p> <p>Violence, public and domestic, in peace and war, is muted by the modulated tones of civilised life. This relentless gentility would risk serious tedium without that sharpness of eye and wit. The head, you could say, remains as cool as the heart. He lacks what Amis and most of the later English humourists have possessed - sentimentality. That would have destroyed the work.</p> <p>He has a strong indulgence towards fantasy and eccentric behaviour, always with the assumption that it is observed and not invented. He can be ruthless, not always in expected settings. There are funerals, not necessarily particularly mournful occasions; death seems no more serious than life, which is indeed serious enough in so inflexible an English comedy world. There is an inclination for ritual, with serious sacrificial moments like the drowning of a key manuscript in the Regent's Park Canal (Books Do Furnish A Room), or the death - could it be possible after all? - of Widmerpool in the final volume of the sequence. The fiction adds up to a marvel of skill, originality, patience and sheer longwindedness. Technically the challenge, brilliantly met, must have been the handling of that enormous flock of free-range characters and the disposing of the maddening, mysterious, apparently indestructible Widmerpool. No wonder the face in Poussin's ritual dance came to look more malign than ever, for the Powell version must have called for a kind of anti-choreography remote from dancing. These hundreds of performers had to be trained to collide with each other as much as possible for fear that they might otherwise stray off and never be seen again.</p> <p>There must have been many who wished that for Widmerpool. Did Anthony Powell ever wish he had never created the man, if man it was? Keeping track of Widmerpool through twelve volumes and a million words, not really knowing whether he was ink or flesh, whether his true existence was inside the book or out, could have been a lifetime's job in itself. He popped up everywhere: something in the City, something in the army, employed in many an advisory capacity. He was a Labour MP under Attlee, an admirer of Mrs Ernest Simpson. Hugh Gaitskell - though nobody seems quite sure about this - was thought to have been instrumental in getting him a peerage. He influenced people's lives though not in the traditional way; more a kind of one-man quango. He would always be in touch. There was no danger of his getting lost. Powell tells us, in his Journals for 1982-1986 published in 1995, that he first came across Widmerpool as a Cromwellian Captain of Horse in Hutchinson's Memoirs of the Civil War. Where, and when, will the man turn up next?</p> <p>After the Music of Time sequence Powell published The Fisher King, an elegant modern version of an ancient myth. There was also a short novel dementedly entitled O, How the Wheel Becomes It! (Ophelia's mad scene, it fittingly turns out, provides the clue).</p>",

A fastidious satirist, he never shouts and seldom mocks - or (except in the physical sense) moves very far. Powell's ideal hunting-ground seems a mile square and an inch deep, and there are bound to be some - particularly when so little, for such long spells, manages to happen - who get to find the inflexibly well-bred narrative voice a shade wearing. This is surely part of the fun. Powell's descriptive powers are clinically accurate and searching, and he is constantly putting himself in the way of good material. He is a conscientious mixer in the interests of his profession. It goes beyond clubland and the haunts of off-duty politicians, bureaucrats and important artists, though even lower life has its standards and good manners survive in unlikely places. Powell's world is well supplied with pubs without being beery, and there are times when the streets are thronged with well-born paupers conscientiously dodging their creditors. In taxis, of course. Violence, public and domestic, in peace and war, is muted by the modulated tones of civilised life. This relentless gentility would risk serious tedium without that sharpness of eye and wit. The head, you could say, remains as cool as the heart. He lacks what Amis and most of the later English humourists have possessed - sentimentality. That would have destroyed the work. He has a strong indulgence towards fantasy and eccentric behaviour, always with the assumption that it is observed and not invented. He can be ruthless, not always in expected settings. There are funerals, not necessarily particularly mournful occasions; death seems no more serious than life, which is indeed serious enough in so inflexible an English comedy world. There is an inclination for ritual, with serious sacrificial moments like the drowning of a key manuscript in the Regent's Park Canal (Books Do Furnish A Room), or the death - could it be possible after all? - of Widmerpool in the final volume of the sequence. The fiction adds up to a marvel of skill, originality, patience and sheer longwindedness. Technically the challenge, brilliantly met, must have been the handling of that enormous flock of free-range characters and the disposing of the maddening, mysterious, apparently indestructible Widmerpool. No wonder the face in Poussin's ritual dance came to look more malign than ever, for the Powell version must have called for a kind of anti-choreography remote from dancing. These hundreds of performers had to be trained to collide with each other as much as possible for fear that they might otherwise stray off and never be seen again. There must have been many who wished that for Widmerpool. Did Anthony Powell ever wish he had never created the man, if man it was? Keeping track of Widmerpool through twelve volumes and a million words, not really knowing whether he was ink or flesh, whether his true existence was inside the book or out, could have been a lifetime's job in itself. He popped up everywhere: something in the City, something in the army, employed in many an advisory capacity. He was a Labour MP under Attlee, an admirer of Mrs Ernest Simpson. Hugh Gaitskell - though nobody seems quite sure about this - was thought to have been instrumental in getting him a peerage. He influenced people's lives though not in the traditional way; more a kind of one-man quango. He would always be in touch. There was no danger of his getting lost. Powell tells us, in his Journals for 1982-1986 published in 1995, that he first came across Widmerpool as a Cromwellian Captain of Horse in Hutchinson's Memoirs of the Civil War. Where, and when, will the man turn up next? After the Music of Time sequence Powell published The Fisher King, an elegant modern version of an ancient myth. There was also a short novel dementedly entitled O, How the Wheel Becomes It! (Ophelia's mad scene, it fittingly turns out, provides the clue).",

There was a time when generation after generation of children read the same books, classics that were handed down from parent to child. Now there is a huge amount of choice. But how do you choose? </p> <p>We hope to help you. Today sees the start of a new monthly column that will select from the best new titles and reissues. These columns can be used in conjunction with the Guardian website (<a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk\">BooksUnlimited</a>) where you will find short reviews of classic, well-loved and crucial books that will make a useful backbone of any children's library. </p> <p>All books can be bought at a discount direct from the website, which will be regularly updated.

Children develop at different rates. The books selected have not been chosen by any criteria other than that we have enjoyed them and think you and your children might too.</p> <p>They have not been selected because they have educational value, tie in with the National Curriculum or may help your child learn to read, although some will do all these things. These books are not about fact-gathering, but about journeys of the imagination that help children find out about the world around them in the widest sense and take them to places they may not otherwise go. </p> <p><strong> Ages 0-4</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Little Pig Figwort</strong> </p> <p>by Henrietta Branford, illustrated by Claudio Munoz (Collins, \u00a310.99; CultureShop price \u00a38.99 plus 99p p&amp;p. See above for details) </p> <p> The final book from ace kid's writer Branford, who died last year, is a high-spirited tale about a little pig who likes to have fun - so much so that he can't get to sleep. But when he goes to the bottom of the sea the mermaids are sleepy and at the north pole the polar bears growl at him to go home. It is only on the moon that he finds his soulmates, the moon pigs, who play all night. </p> <p>The I-can't-get-to-sleep picture book is genre in children's fiction, and frankly some of them are a yawn. But Branford's humorous text and Munoz's expressive pictures ensure that this one won't send you to sleep while you are reading it. </p> <p> <strong> My First Elmer Joke Book</strong> </p> <p>by David McKee (Red Fox, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99 plus 99p UK p&amp;p) </p> <p> What do elephants talk in their sleep? Mumbo jumbo. </p> <p>What do you give an elephant with big feet? Plenty of room. </p> <p>I never used to see the point of the cute patchwork elephant: his only purpose seemed to be cute. Maybe that's why babies seem to love him so much. But this little book is incredibly daft and full of joy. The vivid pictures have real wit, which is more than you can say about the jokes, which are all as old as an elephant. </p> <p>You and your one-year-old will love the colourful pictures, while your four-year-old will wet herself at the sublime silliness of the jokes and wear you out repeating them. </p> <p><strong> Ages 5-7 </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> The Famous Adventures of Jack</strong> </p> <p>by Berlie Doherty (Hodder Children's Books, \u00a310.99 hb, \u00a33.99 pb; CultureShop price \u00a33.99 freepost) </p> <p> A girl walks into a cottage and asks for Jack. \"Which Jack did you want?\" asks the old woman inside. \"They're 10 a penny, Jacks are.\" Ten a penny - but all extraordinary. </p> <p>Clever Jacks, daft Jacks, Jacks who kill giants. . . Familiar and not so familiar Jacks all turn up in this clever weaving together of a series of short stories. Then there are the talking cats, disappearing castles - and don't forget the magic beans. </p> <p>Ingeniously splicing the old and the new, this is a book that plays on children's familiarity with fairy tales and which celebrates our need to hear old stories in a new ways. </p> <p> <strong> Grandma Chickenlegs</strong> </p> <p>by Geraldine McCaughrean, illustrated by Moira Kemp (Doubleday, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99 plus 99p p&amp;p) </p> <p> Parents are often so hung up at this stage on getting their children to decipher text that they forget the importance of pictures. But there is nothing babyish about this re-telling of the Baba Yaga story. The poetry of the text is perfectly in tune with colourful pictures that evoke the inner turmoil of little Tatia: when her mother dies, her father marries a woman \"with eyes as sharp as needles and a soul as thin as thread\". </p> <p>There is something pleasingly theatrical in the way the pictures show Tatia as a tiny figure and her persecutors as huge presences until the final pages, when the newly confident Tatia soars in the air on a swing over her sleeping father. </p> <p><strong> Ages 8-11</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Amber's Secret</strong> </p> <p>by Ann Pilling (Collins, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a36.99 plus 99p p&amp;p) </p> <p> \"Did you know,\" said Amber one day to her friend Sally, \"that if you pick up the phone and ring Appleford 616 you can talk to God?\" It is the 1950s; Sally's dad is abroad and her mum has been taken into hospital. When Sally accidentally shatters her mother's beloved grandfather clock and the mending of the clock becomes mixed up in her mind with the mending of her mother. Desperate, she rings God. </p> <p>This is a beautiful, quiet book about faith, miracles and the kindness of strangers, which evokes the lumpy-mince misery of childhood and the sense of being utterly alone. Not action-packed enough to appeal across the board, but plenty will fall for its reflective charm. </p> <p> <strong> The Dare Game</strong> </p> <p>by Jacqueline Wilson (Doubleday, \u00a310.99; CultureShop price, \u00a38.99 plus 99p UK p&amp;p) </p> <p> This sequel to The Story of Tracey Beaker is not in the same league as Wilson's The Illustrated Mum, which scooped this year's Guardian children's award. But, as always with Wilson, the prose is as feisty as her heroine, the armour-plated Tracey, a girl with a hard attitude and the softest of hearts. </p> <p>Now out of the children's home and living with her foster mum, Cam, Tracey hasn't given up hope of being reunited with her mother. But only as the dares that she sets herself and her friends get wilder, does Tracey finally face up to reality. Wilson tackles subjects that other writers shy away from and this meaty read will win her more fans. </p> <p><strong> Ages 12 + </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Heaven Eyes</strong> </p> <p>by David Almond (Hodder, \u00a310; CultureShop price \u00a38.99 plus 99p UK p&amp;p) </p> <p> Erin, January and Mouse run away from the children's home where they live and set sail on a raft down the river. They are rescued by Heaven Eyes, a girl with webbed hands and feet who believes they are her lost siblings. </p> <p>Set largely in a dilapidated warehouse, Almond's story is a beautiful, eerie tale in which the living and the dead find comfort in each other. What's it about? Who knows? But perhaps about daring to go as far as death and having the bravery to come back again, or about discovering that you don't have to go as far as you think to find yourself. Like Almond's brilliant Skellig, this is a a book about love and faith - particularly faith in yourself and others. </p> <p> <strong> A Long Way From Chicago</strong> </p> <p>by Richard Peck (Hodder Children's Books, \u00a33.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99 freepost) </p> <p> It is 1929 and Joey and his sister travel from the Chicago of Al Capone to the hicksville town of their gran on what is to be the first of a yearly summer visit. Here in her parlour they see their first dead body. </p> <p>A series of interlinked short stories that telescope in time to 1942, Peck's brilliant book has the polecat reek of authentic American fiction, filled with characters such as Shotgun Cheetham, a gran who behaves with the recklessness of a frontier-town outlaw. </p> <p>Seen entirely through the eyes of the child, this is a great book about the way you grow up slower than you want and much faster than you ever realise.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Fiona Smith thought she was a good parent to her three children. The house was filled with books and paintings and friends. It was a happy childhood, a left-wing, middle-class upbringing in a cosmopolitan, multicultural area of London. </p> <p>When the children were still young, their father left, so Fiona brought them up alone. She held down a full-time job and studied for a degree in the evenings. Rightly or wrongly, that's the bit she regrets. If she had her time again, she'd have been at home more for her children. </p> <p>Her two sons and daughter mixed well at school; their best friends were black, Indian, Greek Cypriot. They would play together, go to each other's houses for tea. Then Mark, her eldest, began at the local secondary school and things began to change.</p> <p>He said his dinner money was taken off him at knifepoint by black pupils, who would pick fights and cause trouble. He said the teachers were frightened of dealing with the troublemakers for fear of being called racist. </p> <p>His solution to his growing sense of injustice was radical. At the age of 13 he threw in his lot with the British National Party. His younger brother Philip followed soon after. </p> <p>They put up racist posters in their bedroom, played racist songs on their hi-fis and became increasingly entangled in the scary world of the far right. </p> <p>They produced magazines, took part in demonstrations, performed in skinhead bands and were repeatedly arrested for their activities. </p> <p>Adolescence is a frightening time for most parents. Drugs, sex, teenage pregnancy, bunking off, car crashes, running away - but joining the BNP? </p> <p>It was Fiona Smith's reality; it's also one of the scenarios raised in a document published today promoting children's rights - their rights to be listened to, to help make decisions about things which affect them and to express their own views. </p> <p>The concept of children's rights is not popular in Britain, according to Gerison Lansdown, director of the Children's Rights Office and editor of the new document, All Right at Home? \"They are seen as undermining to us as parents. </p> <p>\"But tackling children's human rights enhances relationships within families. We wanted to provide practical ways to show how important it is that children are respected and listened to.\" </p> <p>Fiona Smith tried to reason with her sons. She listened to them, gave them room to express their views, then put the opposite argument. \"I remember my father used to be quite authoritarian. You had to be what he wanted you to be. You had to wear the clothes he said. You had to go to church on Sunday. There was no argument. </p> <p>\"I used to think, I'm never going to lay down the law with my children - I'm going to listen to their argument and go from there. There was no other way. After all, I had no control over what they did when they were out.\" </p> <p>To start with, she thought they would outgrow it. She would take down the fascist posters, her sons would just put them back up. Then they began to be picked up by the police for distributing leaflets or being involved in demonstrations. </p> <p>\"They couldn't understand why I couldn't support them. They thought I was naive, that I didn't understand how the world worked. One of the main things they began to believe in was that the Holocaust hadn't happened. It was like talking to the Flat Earth Society. You could not get past some issues with them. </p> <p>\"The first time they got picked up by the police, they gave me a present to say sorry. It was quite sad, really. They knew books were important to me, but they wouldn't have known what to get me. They gave me a Wilbur Smith. They wanted to show me that what they were doing was right and that they would create a better world. </p> <p>\"Among our friends (many of them black or Jewish), people used to agonise about which university to send their child to. I was just concerned with which police station I was going to have to pick mine up from next.\" </p> <p>Then her sons began to come home beaten up. They went into hiding, disappearing for weeks on end, living at different addresses. She would see them on television taking part in marches; they'd be featured in newspapers. It began to have a detrimental effect on their younger sister, Eve, who began playing truant from school. </p> <p>Fiona couldn't bear the shame of it any more. She suffered a nervous breakdown. \"I sank into such a depression I couldn't stop crying. Everything was disintegrating around me. My children were growing up and they were growing away from me.\" She told her sons to move in with their father. She simply couldn't cope any more. </p> <p>One day, her sons' activities took an even more serious turn. She received a call telling her that Mark had been arrested in East Germany. He had been performing with his band, a fracas had broken out, someone had been stabbed and Mark was one of those accused. \"I remember thinking, he's done it now; that's the the limit.\" </p> <p>It was eight weeks later that she finally contacted him. \"We went across to see him. He was so horrified at finding himself in prison, it was a turning point for him. For years I had hoped and prayed for a turning point to come and this was it.\" </p> <p>Mark admitted he was there when the stabbing happened but denied being responsible. His colleagues who had carried out the attack let him carry the can, and as a result he lost all respect for them. He stood trial but the case was adjourned because his co-defendants failed to turn up and it has never been resolved. </p> <p>\"It wasn't until a couple of years after that I was convinced it was over. Mark wrote me letters saying he would make me proud of him again. And he has,\" says Fiona. </p> <p>Philip took a little longer to extricate himself. He was still involved in writing lyrics and producing magazines and became a key figure in the far right. Fiona's not sure how he escaped, but she's convinced he has. </p> <p>Her sons are now in their mid-20s, and Fiona sees them every day. They never talk about it - not yet. \"It's enough for me that it's come right.

      "bodyText": "Fiona Smith thought she was a good parent to her three children. The house was filled with books and paintings and friends. It was a happy childhood, a left-wing, middle-class upbringing in a cosmopolitan, multicultural area of London. When the children were still young, their father left, so Fiona brought them up alone. She held down a full-time job and studied for a degree in the evenings. Rightly or wrongly, that's the bit she regrets. If she had her time again, she'd have been at home more for her children. Her two sons and daughter mixed well at school; their best friends were black, Indian, Greek Cypriot. They would play together, go to each other's houses for tea. Then Mark, her eldest, began at the local secondary school and things began to change. He said his dinner money was taken off him at knifepoint by black pupils, who would pick fights and cause trouble. He said the teachers were frightened of dealing with the troublemakers for fear of being called racist. His solution to his growing sense of injustice was radical. At the age of 13 he threw in his lot with the British National Party. His younger brother Philip followed soon after. They put up racist posters in their bedroom, played racist songs on their hi-fis and became increasingly entangled in the scary world of the far right. They produced magazines, took part in demonstrations, performed in skinhead bands and were repeatedly arrested for their activities. Adolescence is a frightening time for most parents. Drugs, sex, teenage pregnancy, bunking off, car crashes, running away - but joining the BNP? It was Fiona Smith's reality; it's also one of the scenarios raised in a document published today promoting children's rights - their rights to be listened to, to help make decisions about things which affect them and to express their own views. The concept of children's rights is not popular in Britain, according to Gerison Lansdown, director of the Children's Rights Office and editor of the new document, All Right at Home? \"They are seen as undermining to us as parents. \"But tackling children's human rights enhances relationships within families. We wanted to provide practical ways to show how important it is that children are respected and listened to.\" Fiona Smith tried to reason with her sons. She listened to them, gave them room to express their views, then put the opposite argument. \"I remember my father used to be quite authoritarian. You had to be what he wanted you to be. You had to wear the clothes he said. You had to go to church on Sunday. There was no argument. \"I used to think, I'm never going to lay down the law with my children - I'm going to listen to their argument and go from there. There was no other way. After all, I had no control over what they did when they were out.\" To start with, she thought they would outgrow it. She would take down the fascist posters, her sons would just put them back up. Then they began to be picked up by the police for distributing leaflets or being involved in demonstrations. \"They couldn't understand why I couldn't support them. They thought I was naive, that I didn't understand how the world worked. One of the main things they began to believe in was that the Holocaust hadn't happened. It was like talking to the Flat Earth Society. You could not get past some issues with them. \"The first time they got picked up by the police, they gave me a present to say sorry. It was quite sad, really. They knew books were important to me, but they wouldn't have known what to get me. They gave me a Wilbur Smith. They wanted to show me that what they were doing was right and that they would create a better world. \"Among our friends (many of them black or Jewish), people used to agonise about which university to send their child to. I was just concerned with which police station I was going to have to pick mine up from next.\" Then her sons began to come home beaten up. They went into hiding, disappearing for weeks on end, living at different addresses. She would see them on television taking part in marches; they'd be featured in newspapers. It began to have a detrimental effect on their younger sister, Eve, who began playing truant from school. Fiona couldn't bear the shame of it any more. She suffered a nervous breakdown. \"I sank into such a depression I couldn't stop crying. Everything was disintegrating around me. My children were growing up and they were growing away from me.\" She told her sons to move in with their father. She simply couldn't cope any more. One day, her sons' activities took an even more serious turn. She received a call telling her that Mark had been arrested in East Germany. He had been performing with his band, a fracas had broken out, someone had been stabbed and Mark was one of those accused. \"I remember thinking, he's done it now; that's the the limit.\" It was eight weeks later that she finally contacted him. \"We went across to see him. He was so horrified at finding himself in prison, it was a turning point for him. For years I had hoped and prayed for a turning point to come and this was it.\" Mark admitted he was there when the stabbing happened but denied being responsible. His colleagues who had carried out the attack let him carry the can, and as a result he lost all respect for them. He stood trial but the case was adjourned because his co-defendants failed to turn up and it has never been resolved. \"It wasn't until a couple of years after that I was convinced it was over. Mark wrote me letters saying he would make me proud of him again. And he has,\" says Fiona. Philip took a little longer to extricate himself. He was still involved in writing lyrics and producing magazines and became a key figure in the far right. Fiona's not sure how he escaped, but she's convinced he has. Her sons are now in their mid-20s, and Fiona sees them every day. They never talk about it - not yet. \"It's enough for me that it's come right. I just apologise to all our friends, and to everybody we know and don't know who suffered from what they were involved in.\" According to Gerison Lansdown, Fiona reacted in exactly the right way to her sons' involvement. Had she been more heavy-handed and tried to ban them from their activities, she might have lost them for good. \"As we say in the document, the tendency is to want to protect your children by preventing them from doing the thing that you think is wrong or would place them at risk.

Sometimes you love them more because of the mistakes they made. That's the way I feel. They've come through it.\"",

      "body": "<p>Childbirth may be natural but it has always been difficult - large head, small hole. So how on earth did we get lumbered with the National Childbirth Trust as our only alternative source of support to the mighty, macho, medical establishment? Pregnant women are faced with two stark and equally unpalatable extremes: either submit legs akimbo to the stirrups, forceps and baby monitor, or subscribe to the NCT's quasi-spiritual natural birth dogma, which maintains that it is possible to have a serene, enjoyable, even sexual experience of giving birth. The purpose of childbirth is to have a baby rather than to experience labour, but the NCT ignores that - preparation for parenthood in its classes is almost non-existent. </p> <p>Some 600,000 women give birth every year in the UK and the NCT reaches roughly half of them through their 400 local support groups. Their classes are so heavily oversubscribed that they daren't advertise them and that's not because women suddenly turn into committed naturopaths when they discover they're pregnant (although some do). It's because there is nothing else on offer for the woman who feels that she needs a little more than the quick \"Let's listen to baby's heart\" approach currently available at NHS antenatal. </p> <p>Once at the NCT group, women become easily seduced by the notion that there is a right and a wrong way to give birth. The \"right\" way is to keep control over the course of your labour, to resist medical intervention and to deliver, tear free, in water or at home with the lights dimmed. Pain relief is to be resisted, too, because it can cross the placenta wall to the baby or prevent the mother from pushing properly. Yoga and deep breathing will get you through. Caesareans tend to happen to those poor, weak women who lose control and cannot do it by deep breathing alone. </p> <p>Then when you hobble to the labour ward clutching your bean bag - for most first-time mothers fail in their attempts to persuade their doctor to let them give birth at home - you're almost destined to give birth the \"wrong\" way. The midwives hook you up to a baby monitor and start laying bets as to when you'll be screaming for an epidural. They leave you alone for hours on end with the baby's father, who is even more terrified than you are. Most labour wards resemble the set of ER rather than the dimly-lit, serene intimacy of our imaginings. There's a feeling of emergency in the air. As anxiety mounts, and the contractions swell with painful intensity, women feel control slipping away. Forceps, episiotomies and even the dreaded caesarean are now only moments away. </p> <p>Crucial information tends to get left out of NCT briefings. Next to nothing is said about the immense upheaval that childbirth brings, physically, psychologically and emotionally, and countless women are left stranded after they've had a baby because they feel they have failed. After interviewing new mothers for my book, my guess is that for every woman who has had a \"life-enhancing experience of becoming a parent\" thanks to the NCT (and that is the Trust's aim, according to its director, Belinda Phipps) there are at least two who have been left severely disillusioned by a philosophy that failed to provide them with the truth about giving birth or new motherhood. </p> <p>NCT dogma fits in neatly with the popular notion of perfect motherhood, where women are self-sacrificial to the point of masochism for the welfare of their child. Just when modern science gave women a glimmer of hope with pain relief and life-saving equipment after centuries of agony and terror, the natural birth movement snatched it away from them. Once women would have killed for anaesthetic; now women have to do without it to prevent baby from feeling groggy after birth, when I would have thought a little dope might just ease the shock of being born. Once women were able to trust midwives when the time came. Now childbirth has to be studied and practised for like some gruesome exam, and aspirational women are set such high targets that they then feel like terrible failures because they have had an episiotomy or were unable to ride those extraordinary waves of pain. Inevitably, those feelings of failure contribute to postnatal unhappiness, which is extensive. </p> <p> In the main, NCT antenatal classes are staffed by volunteers who are fascinated by the whole process of childbirth and have probably had a good experience of labour. How many women who have had caesareans or six-inch episiotomies willingly volunteer to become NCT counsellors?

      "bodyText": "Childbirth may be natural but it has always been difficult - large head, small hole. So how on earth did we get lumbered with the National Childbirth Trust as our only alternative source of support to the mighty, macho, medical establishment? Pregnant women are faced with two stark and equally unpalatable extremes: either submit legs akimbo to the stirrups, forceps and baby monitor, or subscribe to the NCT's quasi-spiritual natural birth dogma, which maintains that it is possible to have a serene, enjoyable, even sexual experience of giving birth. The purpose of childbirth is to have a baby rather than to experience labour, but the NCT ignores that - preparation for parenthood in its classes is almost non-existent. Some 600,000 women give birth every year in the UK and the NCT reaches roughly half of them through their 400 local support groups. Their classes are so heavily oversubscribed that they daren't advertise them and that's not because women suddenly turn into committed naturopaths when they discover they're pregnant (although some do). It's because there is nothing else on offer for the woman who feels that she needs a little more than the quick \"Let's listen to baby's heart\" approach currently available at NHS antenatal. Once at the NCT group, women become easily seduced by the notion that there is a right and a wrong way to give birth. The \"right\" way is to keep control over the course of your labour, to resist medical intervention and to deliver, tear free, in water or at home with the lights dimmed. Pain relief is to be resisted, too, because it can cross the placenta wall to the baby or prevent the mother from pushing properly. Yoga and deep breathing will get you through. Caesareans tend to happen to those poor, weak women who lose control and cannot do it by deep breathing alone. Then when you hobble to the labour ward clutching your bean bag - for most first-time mothers fail in their attempts to persuade their doctor to let them give birth at home - you're almost destined to give birth the \"wrong\" way. The midwives hook you up to a baby monitor and start laying bets as to when you'll be screaming for an epidural. They leave you alone for hours on end with the baby's father, who is even more terrified than you are. Most labour wards resemble the set of ER rather than the dimly-lit, serene intimacy of our imaginings. There's a feeling of emergency in the air. As anxiety mounts, and the contractions swell with painful intensity, women feel control slipping away. Forceps, episiotomies and even the dreaded caesarean are now only moments away. Crucial information tends to get left out of NCT briefings. Next to nothing is said about the immense upheaval that childbirth brings, physically, psychologically and emotionally, and countless women are left stranded after they've had a baby because they feel they have failed. After interviewing new mothers for my book, my guess is that for every woman who has had a \"life-enhancing experience of becoming a parent\" thanks to the NCT (and that is the Trust's aim, according to its director, Belinda Phipps) there are at least two who have been left severely disillusioned by a philosophy that failed to provide them with the truth about giving birth or new motherhood. NCT dogma fits in neatly with the popular notion of perfect motherhood, where women are self-sacrificial to the point of masochism for the welfare of their child. Just when modern science gave women a glimmer of hope with pain relief and life-saving equipment after centuries of agony and terror, the natural birth movement snatched it away from them. Once women would have killed for anaesthetic; now women have to do without it to prevent baby from feeling groggy after birth, when I would have thought a little dope might just ease the shock of being born. Once women were able to trust midwives when the time came. Now childbirth has to be studied and practised for like some gruesome exam, and aspirational women are set such high targets that they then feel like terrible failures because they have had an episiotomy or were unable to ride those extraordinary waves of pain. Inevitably, those feelings of failure contribute to postnatal unhappiness, which is extensive. In the main, NCT antenatal classes are staffed by volunteers who are fascinated by the whole process of childbirth and have probably had a good experience of labour. How many women who have had caesareans or six-inch episiotomies willingly volunteer to become NCT counsellors? Then there is the rather questionable link between the two wings of the organisation: the local support groups and classes, and the campaign side, which has many admirable aims, such as bringing down the national caesarean rate to the World Health Organisation recommended level of 8% (the official UK rate is 18% but it has gone as high as 37% in some areas). If the NCT were either a campaign group or a resource for pregnant women, it would be far less contentious. But the attempt to be both means that individual women are unwittingly used as tiny arrows in the natural birth movement's war against the mighty maternity machine.

The NHS and social services abandon women unless there is evidence of shaken baby syndrome or extreme psychosis, in which case she is locked up and given psychotropic drugs. But the NCT, with its extensive reach and network of local support groups, could provide women with a genuine and ongoing source of support if it embraced the full truth of new motherhood: that childbirth is a unique experience for every single woman and that most get through it somehow and, most importantly, that the nine months after labour are just as important as those that preceded it.

The Treasury estimates that the combined effects of the last three budgets is to reduce the number of children in poverty by 1.2m by 2002. But poverty will still remain far above the EU average - even if health expenditure is closer to it - and far above its 1979 level. </p> <p>Will this reduction in child poverty improve child health? The cynic may say it will all go on confectionery, crisps and canned drinks - or, worse, more tobacco, alcohol and other drugs - which may worsen child health. But more money gives the opportunity to spend more on nutritious, often more expensive, food; better heating, more holidays, less stress and higher self-esteem should all improve child health. </p> <p>Yet if the government wants to be sure of improving the health of poor children it cannot rely on only modest increases in family income of some \u00a330 per week in the poorest fifth of families. Improving nutrition does require higher benefits for children and also access to healthy and affordable food supplies, as the 1998 Acheson report on health inequalities stressed. Yet for the children going off to school without any breakfast, these are not enough. The more direct option is to feed the children through school dinner and breakfast programmes. </p> <p>On school dinners an opportunity was missed in the budget. Giving free school dinners to families receiving working families tax credit would have been a sure way of improving child nutrition. </p> <p>On breakfasts, there is clear evidence from the US that children's learning suffers if they do not get a nutritious breakfast. Remarkably, the US government has responded by developing nutritious programmes for school dinners and breakfasts on which more is now spent than on welfare benefits. Over 7m children in 70,000 schools get free or subsidised breakfasts in a federal programme administered by the department of agriculture. </p> <p>In Britain, tentative trials of breakfast clubs have been started that include about 10,000 children.

      "body": "<p>It's Monday lunchtime and Brixton tube is bustling. A man sits on the floor, his back against a photo booth and a plastic bag slumped beside him. He's not alone, there are a handful of others who have nowhere to go but loiter at the station. </p> <p>Most fit under one of several headings - homeless, disaffected, addicts. But not the man with the plastic bag. Though to passers-by he is another down and out to skirt around, he is in fact the director of a charity, Newham Drugs Advice Project. Last night he joined reams of the capital's homeless by sleeping on the street. </p> <p>In a bid to reconnect with the realities faced by those his charity strives to help, Viv Ahmun decided to sleep rough for 48 hours. It's not an original concept. MPs and celebrities have embarked on similar ventures to raise their profiles, be seen to be \"in touch\" and raise money for charity. But unlike them, we expect charity executives to not only be steering fundraising initiatives but, crucially, to be in touch with whatever grassroots issues are at the core of their organisations. </p> <p>Therefore, what is unusual in Ahmun's undertaking is, firstly, that he felt the need to reconnect and, secondly, that he is prepared to admit that he is perhaps more removed from the problems his charity exists to alleviate than he would like to be. </p> <p>\"As a director it's easy to cut yourself off and just deal with bureau cracy. You're constantly at meetings, going to conferences and it's very comfortable, but it's not the reality we're paid to address and be actively involved in,\" explains Ahmun. \"I spend 80% of my time in that kind of environment because one of my key responsibilities is to secure funds and that's where I gain access to people who enable me to do that. </p> <p>\"If I had my way, I'd spend two days a week at grassroots level but that doesn't happen because the bigger the organisation gets the more pressure there is to find funds to keep it running. It creates an imbalance which is why I'm doing this in an effort to redress that.\" </p> <p>His actions raise questions about the role of charity directors: how in touch are they and how in touch do they need to be in order to do their jobs effectively? </p> <p>Indeed, as more major charities are run like private sector companies and, in turn, senior appointments are often made on the basis of an applicant's ability to manage finance, corporate identity and strategic development rather than their hands-on experience of charity work, these have become increasingly important questions. </p> <p> Though it would be naive to think that charities could operate as effectively without incorporating a business ethic, Ahmun worries that such focus can mean that a discernible connection between chief executive and operation worker is lost. </p> <p>It was this concern which was a contributing factor in Christian Aids appointment of their director, Daleep Mukarji. His 25 years as a Christian Aid partner, and background running a health and development programme in rural India, meant that he was in touch with what was going on on the ground. </p> <p>\"I've worked at a local, national and international level so I know how the organisation functions from grassroots to senior management. That, and tapping into my experience as a southern person from a developing country, is an important way of me keeping in touch,\" says Mukarji. </p> <p>Back in Brixton, Ahmun, who also spent his early years working as an outreach worker, says part of his motive for sleeping rough is also to \"re-energise\". Ahmun is under no illusion that a mere 48 hours will enable him to know what it's like to be homeless. \"Tomorrow I'll be back at my desk. That's my reality but it hasn't stop me feeling unhappy sleeping in a space someone had urinated in and feeling the cold in my bones. It's that experience I'll draw on when I'm advocating on behalf of people who use services I'm trying to secure money for.\" </p> <p>Mukarji agrees: \"We've got to get across that we're not just helping people to help themselves but, these are human beings and we can identify with them rather than just discussing how we can help them. A sense of solidarity and partnership is essential.\"</p>",

In a bid to reconnect with the realities faced by those his charity strives to help, Viv Ahmun decided to sleep rough for 48 hours. It's not an original concept. MPs and celebrities have embarked on similar ventures to raise their profiles, be seen to be \"in touch\" and raise money for charity. But unlike them, we expect charity executives to not only be steering fundraising initiatives but, crucially, to be in touch with whatever grassroots issues are at the core of their organisations. Therefore, what is unusual in Ahmun's undertaking is, firstly, that he felt the need to reconnect and, secondly, that he is prepared to admit that he is perhaps more removed from the problems his charity exists to alleviate than he would like to be. \"As a director it's easy to cut yourself off and just deal with bureau cracy. You're constantly at meetings, going to conferences and it's very comfortable, but it's not the reality we're paid to address and be actively involved in,\" explains Ahmun. \"I spend 80% of my time in that kind of environment because one of my key responsibilities is to secure funds and that's where I gain access to people who enable me to do that. \"If I had my way, I'd spend two days a week at grassroots level but that doesn't happen because the bigger the organisation gets the more pressure there is to find funds to keep it running. It creates an imbalance which is why I'm doing this in an effort to redress that.\" His actions raise questions about the role of charity directors: how in touch are they and how in touch do they need to be in order to do their jobs effectively? Indeed, as more major charities are run like private sector companies and, in turn, senior appointments are often made on the basis of an applicant's ability to manage finance, corporate identity and strategic development rather than their hands-on experience of charity work, these have become increasingly important questions. Though it would be naive to think that charities could operate as effectively without incorporating a business ethic, Ahmun worries that such focus can mean that a discernible connection between chief executive and operation worker is lost. It was this concern which was a contributing factor in Christian Aids appointment of their director, Daleep Mukarji. His 25 years as a Christian Aid partner, and background running a health and development programme in rural India, meant that he was in touch with what was going on on the ground. \"I've worked at a local, national and international level so I know how the organisation functions from grassroots to senior management. That, and tapping into my experience as a southern person from a developing country, is an important way of me keeping in touch,\" says Mukarji. Back in Brixton, Ahmun, who also spent his early years working as an outreach worker, says part of his motive for sleeping rough is also to \"re-energise\". Ahmun is under no illusion that a mere 48 hours will enable him to know what it's like to be homeless. \"Tomorrow I'll be back at my desk. That's my reality but it hasn't stop me feeling unhappy sleeping in a space someone had urinated in and feeling the cold in my bones. It's that experience I'll draw on when I'm advocating on behalf of people who use services I'm trying to secure money for.\" Mukarji agrees: \"We've got to get across that we're not just helping people to help themselves but, these are human beings and we can identify with them rather than just discussing how we can help them. A sense of solidarity and partnership is essential.\"",

At the age of 75, she is still looking after her husband, Arthur, left paralysed by a stroke almost two decades ago. Yet it has taken her more than 12 years to get the electric hoist she needs to move him about their one-bedroom flat. </p> <p>\"It may be a monstrosity, but it's a godsend,\" she says. \"I told them and told them that I couldn't manage, what with him being 14 stone, but nobody took any notice. In the end, I only got anywhere because the physiotherapist at the hospital went potty about it.\" </p> <p>Why the physio went potty was that constantly lifting Arthur, now 91, was doing irreparable damage to his wife's neck and back. After words were exchanged in a no doubt friendly multi-disciplinary way, social services installed the long-desired equipment at the Joneses' flat in Lewisham, south London. \"You shouldn't have to fight like that,\" says Eleanor, \"but it's just the same with supplies. You have to fight for everything.\" </p> <p>Keeping up with the Joneses is something that disability equipment services have not been doing, not by a long chalk. According to a report published today by the Audit Commission, service standards are \"unacceptably low\" in many parts of the country and service patterns lead to inequality and inefficiency. Andrew Foster, the commission's controller, says: \"Long waiting times, unclear eligibility criteria and poor quality products threaten to undermine plans to promote independence in the community.\" </p> <p>The kind of service needed by the Joneses, defined in the report as a \"community equipment service\", is part of a much bigger picture. The commission calculates that more than 4m people depend on some kind of disability equipment, ranging from artificial limbs to hearing aids to bath rails, and that too few of them are getting a good deal. </p> <p>The report, in parts, is shocking. Special mattresses are known to prevent development of pressure sores among people confined to bed for long periods. When sores do develop, they can not only be life threatening but can cost up to \u00a335,000 to treat if plastic surgery is required. Yet at one NHS trust visited by the commission, almost 500 people were found to have been waiting up to 16 months for a mattress - and the longest wait was for a type costing as little as \u00a371. Almost unbelievably, the commission came across one trust - not named and shamed- that had an explicit policy of not issuing pressure relieving mattresses until sores had developed. </p> <p>The report, Fully Equipped, finds that people are often not asked basic questions about the sort of help they need. Before a wheelchair is supplied, barely a third of users are consulted about what they would like to do with it in order that the most appropriate model might be chosen. Even more users - and there are 750,000 of them - are not shown how to manage their wheelchair. A quarter say they were given no contact for help or advice. </p> <p>A second problem identified is the long periods people have to wait for equipment to arrive. The average wait for a hearing aid, from GP referral to fitting, is 19 weeks. In one in five health authority areas, it is more than six months. </p> <p>This problem is often compounded by confusion over people's eligibility for help. In a ruling today by the local government ombudsman, Harlow council in Essex is found to have taken eight months to install a stairlift at the home of an 85-year-old council tenant, as recommended by the authority's own occupational therapist, because it was misinterpreting the law. The council has apologised to the man and paid him \u00a3150 compensation. </p> <p>Other issues identified in the report include unsuitability of much equipment, as evinced by the one in four people with artificial limbs who do not use them as often as they would like because of their poor fitting, and the often poor quality of products. Hearing aids, for instance, are still largely based on 1970s analogue technology since overtaken by digital techniques. </p> <p> Overall, disability equipment services are said to be organised in ways that are a recipe for poor practice: many services are small, fragmented and characterised by lack of clinical leadership and senior management involvement. Although such services are \"pivotal\" to the success of many current initiatives to promote independent living, the commission says, they have been sorely neglected by top managers. </p> <p>The report gives a sobering account of how lack of co-ordination blighted the early life of a baby born with disabilities in both legs. One leg was amputated and a full-length splint prescribed for the other, but the consultant responsible for fitting an artificial limb decided that the splint - the responsibility of a different clinician - needed to be modified. As the report puts it, a \"debate\" ensued. </p> <p>Even when this issue was resolved, the modified splint \"sat on a shelf for several weeks\" as the supplier and hospital argued over outstanding invoices. Meanwhile, a separate argument was taking place among the wheelchair service, social services and the regional centre for disabilities over assessment of the baby for a special buggy and chair. In the end, all three units did their own assessments. </p> <p>The story concludes: \"The package of care eventually provided was considered inadequate by the specialists at the regional centre. This process took over a year to complete.\" </p> <p>The commission is calling for the restructuring of mobility services, under clinical leadership, and the integration of health and social services provision for community equipment and hearing aids. It wants the Department of Health to raise the profile of these services and, where necessary, give high priority to plans to improve poor quality provision. Above all, though, the commission wants to see the close involvement of service users at all levels of the process to ensure equipment is tailored to their needs and lifestyles. </p> <p>\"Several million people depend on equipment such as hearing aids, wheelchairs or artificial limbs, which have the potential to make or break the quality of their lives - as well as the lives of the 1.7m family or friends who care for them,\" says Foster. \"A higher priority needs to be given to these services at all levels of the NHS.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Fully Equipped costs \u00a320 and is available from Audit Commission Publications (tel: 0800-502030).</p>",

      "body": "<p>A piece of advice for British leaders in search of better drug policies: look east, look south, but don't look west. Where once the Dutch represented a lone voice for reform, now growing parts of Europe are embracing pragmatic harm reduction strategies based upon common sense, science, public health and human rights. </p> <p>I'm not sure why British officials keep turning to the US for lessons in how to deal with drugs. My country, after all, is the one that incarcerates almost as many people for breaking the drug laws as Europe incarcerates for everything else. My country is the one that has allowed 200,000 of its citizens to become infected with the HIV virus rather than make sterile syringes more readily available. My country is the one so committed to \"just say no\" rhetoric and policies, that it provides no realistic drug education or any real fallback strategy for the majority of teenagers who say yes to drugs. </p> <p>It's not easy trying to end the drug war in the US. Punitive drug prohibition and a temperance ideology almost as old as the nation itself are deeply embedded in American laws, institutions and culture. It's our chronic national hysteria, rejuvenated each time a \"new\" drug emerges, ripe for political posturing and media mania. </p> <p>From abroad, the drug war in the US must appear monolithic, broken only by the occasional personality calling for legalisation and the odd prominence of the medical marijuana issue. Viewed from close up, a more nuanced analysis emerges. </p> <p>Our drug tsar, retired general Barry McCaffrey, is a case in point. He's almost certainly the best drug tsar to date, even if that's not saying much, given his competition. Unlike the first drug tsar, William Bennett, McCaffrey prefers to leave the rhetoric of war and zero tolerance behind, speaking instead of the drug problem as a cancer in need of treatment. He has attacked the relentless incarceration of petty drug offenders, spoken out against New York's draconian Rockefeller drug laws, and even called our prison system \"America's internal gulag\". McCaffrey has defended methadone maintenance treatment, and he once tried to reduce the billions of dollars wasted on futile air and sea efforts to prevent drugs from entering the country. </p> <p>Of course, this is the same drug tsar who has mangled and mocked the truth on issues like needle exchange, marijuana and harm reduction policies inside and outside the US. McCaffrey has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the US government remains alone among advanced, industrialised nations in the west in providing not a penny for needle-exchange programmes to reduce the spread of HIV/Aids. His efforts to challenge the scientific consensus bring to mind the cigarette companies' last, desperate claims to have found a new study demonstrating that smoking does not cause cancer. </p> <p>His position on medical marijuana has been shameful - first mocking patients and doctors, then threatening them with prosecution and loss of licence, and now blocking the efforts of state and local authorities to establish responsible, regulated systems of distribution. </p> <p>This is the drug tsar who has presided over a ballooning federal drug budget, now just under $20bn, that favours ineffective and punitive prohibition and enforcement efforts, as did Reagan and Bush. </p> <p>McCaffrey is also notorious for his thin skin, which may explain why he has studiously avoided any public debate with reformers. His insults and claims are always lobbed from a distance. He is careful to withdraw from televised and other public forums when he learns that patients, doctors, scientists and others with a critical view have been invited to participate. </p> <p>As a reformer, I find McCaffrey's dissembling indefensible. But as a political analyst, I cannot help but be aware of the political forces that bear upon him and his office. </p> <p>Political power in the US increasingly lies in the hands of those who smoked marijuana when they were younger, but that generational shift has yet to influence policy. Far more important, and perhaps distinctly American, is the lingering influence of our rigid anti-drug ideology. </p> <p>Most Americans have strong doubts about the drug war. They support treatment instead of incarceration for drug addicts. They think marijuana should be legally available for medical purposes. They are beginning to have doubts about the cost and meaning of incarcerating almost half a million of their fellow citizens for drug law violations. So why does the drug war not just persist but keep growing? </p> <p>Part of the answer lies in what might best be described as a \"drug prohibition complex\" - to take off on President Eisenhower's farewell warning of the military-industrial complex - composed of the hundreds of thousands of law enforcement officials, private prison corporations, anti-drug organisations, drug testing companies and many others who benefit economically, politically, emotionally and other wise from this ever growing edifice. Drug prohibition is now big business in the US. </p> <p>But the part of the answer that is harder for many people, especially non-Americans, to grasp is the powerful influence of what might be called the \"John Birchers of the drug war\". In the 1960s, when anti-communism still represented the national ideology, the John Birch Society was the most anti-communist of all, ever vigilant for any sign of moderation or detente. </p> <p>The \"John Birchers of the drug war\" represent no more than 20% of public opinion today, but their political influence far exceeds that of the nation's leading scientists, scholars and other drug policy experts. Powerful senators and congressmen take their calls, invite them to testify before official hearings, ensure that their organisations are well funded, and act on their advice. Directors of drug treatment and research agencies, fearful of the zealots' wrath, are quick to compromise their own scientific and intellectual integrity. So, too, is drug tsar McCaffrey. </p> <p>Tony Blair and others looking west for drug policy solutions need to be mindful of the US's temperance traditions and drug war politics. McCaffrey has tried hard to put a benign face on US drug policy, but Britons should not be deceived. US drug warriors mock the Dutch, with their coffee shops, but ignore the fact that fewer Dutch of all ages use cannabis than do their American counterparts, and far fewer go on to use cocaine. US officials avert their eyes from Europe's heroin maintenance trials, saying it can't be done here, even as heroin overdose fatalities rise in the US and decline in Switzerland. Now ecstasy use is rising rapidly in the US, and all the government offers are the \"just say no\" bromides of yesteryear. </p> <p>Meanwhile, signs of reform abound in the US. The John Birchers may still be powerful, but they're gradually losing credibility. Marijuana is to them what alcohol was to temperance warriors of old. And just as the temperance advocates became increasingly shrill and silly as prohibition stumbled along, so today's anti-drug extremists sound increasingly foolish to the parent who knows something about marijuana. </p> <p>The presidential election campaign this year boasted two Democratic candidates, Al Gore and Bill Bradley, who admit to having smoked - and inhaled - marijuana a number of times when they were younger. Note too that when Republican candidate George W. Bush refused, last August, to deny that he had used cocaine as a young man, over 80% of the American public told pollsters they didn't care one way or another, and his popularity ratings actually increased. </p> <p>Twelve years ago, a brave new mayor of Baltimore, Kurt Schmoke, provoked a firestorm of controversy at the height of the drug war when he demanded that all options, including decriminalisation, be put on the table. Schmoke weathered the onslaught, and was re-elected twice thereafter. Last summer, two free-speaking governors, Minnesota's Jesse Ventura and New Mexico's Gary Johnson, started calling for major reform of the drug laws. Johnson even used the forbidden \"L\" word, legalisation. And now, for the first time, a politician, congressman Tom Campbell, of California, is running for higher office on a platform that includes prescribing heroin to drug addicts. </p> <p>The fact that these reform advocates include both Republicans and Independents bodes well for the non-partisan future of this struggle. Meanwhile, medical marijuana and other drug policy reform initiatives have triumphed at the ballot 11 out of 12 times since 1996. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong. I don't see any Berlin wall of drug prohibition about to come tumbling down in the US. Each year more people are incarcerated for breaking a drug law. Politicians still fear being blasted as \"soft on crime\" or \"soft on drugs\". But beneath the surface, reformist sentiments are bubbling ever more vigorously. The consensus behind punitive prohibition is crumbling as Americans tire of drug war strategies and rhetoric and seek more sensible alternatives. </p> <p>This is not the time for Britain to embrace what has failed so miserably in my country.

Punitive drug prohibition and a temperance ideology almost as old as the nation itself are deeply embedded in American laws, institutions and culture. It's our chronic national hysteria, rejuvenated each time a \"new\" drug emerges, ripe for political posturing and media mania. From abroad, the drug war in the US must appear monolithic, broken only by the occasional personality calling for legalisation and the odd prominence of the medical marijuana issue. Viewed from close up, a more nuanced analysis emerges. Our drug tsar, retired general Barry McCaffrey, is a case in point. He's almost certainly the best drug tsar to date, even if that's not saying much, given his competition. Unlike the first drug tsar, William Bennett, McCaffrey prefers to leave the rhetoric of war and zero tolerance behind, speaking instead of the drug problem as a cancer in need of treatment. He has attacked the relentless incarceration of petty drug offenders, spoken out against New York's draconian Rockefeller drug laws, and even called our prison system \"America's internal gulag\". McCaffrey has defended methadone maintenance treatment, and he once tried to reduce the billions of dollars wasted on futile air and sea efforts to prevent drugs from entering the country. Of course, this is the same drug tsar who has mangled and mocked the truth on issues like needle exchange, marijuana and harm reduction policies inside and outside the US. McCaffrey has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the US government remains alone among advanced, industrialised nations in the west in providing not a penny for needle-exchange programmes to reduce the spread of HIV/Aids. His efforts to challenge the scientific consensus bring to mind the cigarette companies' last, desperate claims to have found a new study demonstrating that smoking does not cause cancer. His position on medical marijuana has been shameful - first mocking patients and doctors, then threatening them with prosecution and loss of licence, and now blocking the efforts of state and local authorities to establish responsible, regulated systems of distribution. This is the drug tsar who has presided over a ballooning federal drug budget, now just under $20bn, that favours ineffective and punitive prohibition and enforcement efforts, as did Reagan and Bush. McCaffrey is also notorious for his thin skin, which may explain why he has studiously avoided any public debate with reformers. His insults and claims are always lobbed from a distance. He is careful to withdraw from televised and other public forums when he learns that patients, doctors, scientists and others with a critical view have been invited to participate. As a reformer, I find McCaffrey's dissembling indefensible. But as a political analyst, I cannot help but be aware of the political forces that bear upon him and his office. Political power in the US increasingly lies in the hands of those who smoked marijuana when they were younger, but that generational shift has yet to influence policy. Far more important, and perhaps distinctly American, is the lingering influence of our rigid anti-drug ideology. Most Americans have strong doubts about the drug war. They support treatment instead of incarceration for drug addicts. They think marijuana should be legally available for medical purposes. They are beginning to have doubts about the cost and meaning of incarcerating almost half a million of their fellow citizens for drug law violations. So why does the drug war not just persist but keep growing? Part of the answer lies in what might best be described as a \"drug prohibition complex\" - to take off on President Eisenhower's farewell warning of the military-industrial complex - composed of the hundreds of thousands of law enforcement officials, private prison corporations, anti-drug organisations, drug testing companies and many others who benefit economically, politically, emotionally and other wise from this ever growing edifice. Drug prohibition is now big business in the US. But the part of the answer that is harder for many people, especially non-Americans, to grasp is the powerful influence of what might be called the \"John Birchers of the drug war\". In the 1960s, when anti-communism still represented the national ideology, the John Birch Society was the most anti-communist of all, ever vigilant for any sign of moderation or detente. The \"John Birchers of the drug war\" represent no more than 20% of public opinion today, but their political influence far exceeds that of the nation's leading scientists, scholars and other drug policy experts. Powerful senators and congressmen take their calls, invite them to testify before official hearings, ensure that their organisations are well funded, and act on their advice. Directors of drug treatment and research agencies, fearful of the zealots' wrath, are quick to compromise their own scientific and intellectual integrity. So, too, is drug tsar McCaffrey. Tony Blair and others looking west for drug policy solutions need to be mindful of the US's temperance traditions and drug war politics. McCaffrey has tried hard to put a benign face on US drug policy, but Britons should not be deceived. US drug warriors mock the Dutch, with their coffee shops, but ignore the fact that fewer Dutch of all ages use cannabis than do their American counterparts, and far fewer go on to use cocaine. US officials avert their eyes from Europe's heroin maintenance trials, saying it can't be done here, even as heroin overdose fatalities rise in the US and decline in Switzerland. Now ecstasy use is rising rapidly in the US, and all the government offers are the \"just say no\" bromides of yesteryear. Meanwhile, signs of reform abound in the US. The John Birchers may still be powerful, but they're gradually losing credibility. Marijuana is to them what alcohol was to temperance warriors of old. And just as the temperance advocates became increasingly shrill and silly as prohibition stumbled along, so today's anti-drug extremists sound increasingly foolish to the parent who knows something about marijuana. The presidential election campaign this year boasted two Democratic candidates, Al Gore and Bill Bradley, who admit to having smoked - and inhaled - marijuana a number of times when they were younger. Note too that when Republican candidate George W. Bush refused, last August, to deny that he had used cocaine as a young man, over 80% of the American public told pollsters they didn't care one way or another, and his popularity ratings actually increased. Twelve years ago, a brave new mayor of Baltimore, Kurt Schmoke, provoked a firestorm of controversy at the height of the drug war when he demanded that all options, including decriminalisation, be put on the table. Schmoke weathered the onslaught, and was re-elected twice thereafter. Last summer, two free-speaking governors, Minnesota's Jesse Ventura and New Mexico's Gary Johnson, started calling for major reform of the drug laws. Johnson even used the forbidden \"L\" word, legalisation. And now, for the first time, a politician, congressman Tom Campbell, of California, is running for higher office on a platform that includes prescribing heroin to drug addicts. The fact that these reform advocates include both Republicans and Independents bodes well for the non-partisan future of this struggle. Meanwhile, medical marijuana and other drug policy reform initiatives have triumphed at the ballot 11 out of 12 times since 1996. Don't get me wrong. I don't see any Berlin wall of drug prohibition about to come tumbling down in the US. Each year more people are incarcerated for breaking a drug law. Politicians still fear being blasted as \"soft on crime\" or \"soft on drugs\". But beneath the surface, reformist sentiments are bubbling ever more vigorously. The consensus behind punitive prohibition is crumbling as Americans tire of drug war strategies and rhetoric and seek more sensible alternatives. This is not the time for Britain to embrace what has failed so miserably in my country. Look away, Mr Blair, look away. \u0095 Ethan Nadelmann is founder and director of the Lindesmith Center (www.lindesmith.org) a drug policy institute with offices in New York and San Francisco.

      "bodyText": "Harry Potter's director has been found. Warner Bros has recruited Chris Columbus, the man behind Home Alone and Mrs Doubtfire, to film the hit children's books. \"Harry Potter is the kind of timeless literary achievement that comes around once in a lifetime\", said Warner Bros' Lorenzo di Bonaventura. \"It was important to us to find a director who has an affinity for both children and magic. I can't think of anyone more ideally suited than Chris.\" Columbus gets the gig after rumour touted directors as varied as Spielberg - who passed on the project after a reported disagreement with author JK Rowling - Brad Silberling, Alan Parker, Ivan Reitman, Terry Gilliam and Jonathan Demme (the latter not noted for his 'affinity with children and magic'). Reports on the BBC have confirmed that Oliver Reed will be appearing in Ridley Scott's Gladiator, the film he was shooting when he died. As earlier reports suggested, CGI technology will 'finish up' scenes in which Reed's character was due to appear. The script has been tailored to accommodate Reed's death: his character will now perish saving someone else. The Beeb reports that additional footage was shot with another actor, whose face was digitally replaced with Reed's courtesy of other footage from earlier scenes.

      "byline": "Sarah Boseley, health correspondent",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Rarely do elderly, disabled people - those who are dependent on wheelchairs and hearing aids to lead a reasonable life - capture the limelight. They are not acute hospital cases, where medicine can make the difference between life and death. Nobody can bring back the full use of their legs or ears. There is no drama in their situation, and so they are too easily forgotten about.</p> <p>But, through a piece of good fortune, their plight has become headline news. The Audit Commission's report on the lousy deal they are given by the NHS has arrived hard on the heels of Gordon Brown's Budget bonanza for the health service. The Prime Minister has instantly seen the significance and has condemned the poor treatment of the disabled, who are fobbed off with artificial limbs that don't fit, who have to wait an average 19 weeks - sometimes six months - for a hearing aid based on 30-year-old technology, and who get little training in how to use their wheelchairs.</p> <p>Blair says it is unacceptable that older and disabled people should suffer in this way. Thanks to the Audit Commission's timing, a lot of health authorities and trusts will be forced to smarten up their act and provide better services for these groups. But, if the report had appeared after the general election expected next spring, what are the chances that older and disabled people would again have been overlooked?</p> <p>The fact is that, when it comes to cash, the NHS is a bottomless pit. Even the \u00a32 billion the Chancellor has just thrown in will not solve all the problems.

      "bodyText": "Rarely do elderly, disabled people - those who are dependent on wheelchairs and hearing aids to lead a reasonable life - capture the limelight. They are not acute hospital cases, where medicine can make the difference between life and death. Nobody can bring back the full use of their legs or ears. There is no drama in their situation, and so they are too easily forgotten about. But, through a piece of good fortune, their plight has become headline news. The Audit Commission's report on the lousy deal they are given by the NHS has arrived hard on the heels of Gordon Brown's Budget bonanza for the health service. The Prime Minister has instantly seen the significance and has condemned the poor treatment of the disabled, who are fobbed off with artificial limbs that don't fit, who have to wait an average 19 weeks - sometimes six months - for a hearing aid based on 30-year-old technology, and who get little training in how to use their wheelchairs. Blair says it is unacceptable that older and disabled people should suffer in this way. Thanks to the Audit Commission's timing, a lot of health authorities and trusts will be forced to smarten up their act and provide better services for these groups. But, if the report had appeared after the general election expected next spring, what are the chances that older and disabled people would again have been overlooked? The fact is that, when it comes to cash, the NHS is a bottomless pit. Even the \u00a32 billion the Chancellor has just thrown in will not solve all the problems. The Audit Commission says that it is greater efficiencies that will save money in the long term - and that applies to every area of the NHS. But, because demand for health services is a steep, upward curve, there will always be a need for more money. This is why Alan Milburn has announced that he will use special powers to direct the new money to areas of the service the government deems a priority, rather than let health authorities and trusts have their head. Having put all that cash in, Milburn and Blair want to see results - waiting lists down, cancer treatment speeded up, and popular consumer measures such as NHS Direct expanded. Managers are frustrated at the prospect of not being able to deal with their local priorities, but he who pays the piper (and has an election to win) calls the tune.

Stone's brow furrows. </p> <p>By the time it smooths again, seven minutes later, there is a reply: \"Yes, it is my speech - a speech I've developed over many years.\" En route, he's also spoken about his lecture tours of US colleges, his Yale education, and the way Vietnam attracted him to cinema. Oh, and his stint at film school, where he was taught by Scorsese; corporate power structures (\"a diminishment of humanity\"); Pacino's devotion to his acting roles; new technology (\"Soon, body parts will be cyborgian\"); the doleful pessimism of his last movie, U Turn; and the \"staggering beauty\" of a perfect touch-down. And then, suddenly, he's right back where he started. </p> <p>\"So, yes,\" he nods, \"Al's making a last stand. He's saying, let's be human together. Let's dig in as a team. Which is really one of the major themes of the film.\" </p> <p>One of many. While Any Given Sunday's storyline concerns coach Pacino, team owner Cameron Diaz and maverick quarterback Jamie Foxx, anyone familiar with the bulky 53-year-old behind the camera will be unsurprised to find subtext after subtext emerging from the plot. The film starts with a virtuoso account of a football game; after that it's straight into two-and-a-half hours of meditations on parenthood, accusations against big business, and caustic asides on the broadcast media. All, of course, coated with the outraged sincerity that's become Stone's hallmark. </p> <p>Which isn't to say Any Given Sunday is a failure; in fact, it's possibly Stone's best work since JFK. It's just that, if you're after a fresh insight into its creator, you'll learn nothing. Here, as always, certain concepts are to be cherished (honour, integrity, comradeship), others despised (big money, Machiavellianism). It's been that way ever since he returned from the Vietnam war. </p> <p>I wonder whether he feels that little has changed since then - if the Sharks of Any Given Sunday are really being ripped apart by the same dark forces that destroyed Charlie Sheen in Wall Street and Platoon, and extinguished Anthony Hopkins's Nixon. </p> <p>\"Well,\" he says, \"the critics in the States were a little grudging.\" He stares out of the window, apparently immersed in an entirely different line of inquiry. \"And the sports writers really clamped down on us. I mean, I'm not going to say it was a conspiracy - but the National Football League hated the idea of this movie. And the writers work with the NFL: they've got to get in the locker rooms, they've got to talk to the players. So I know memos were sent to certain people saying, 'Don't attend any premieres, don't cooperate.' \" </p> <p>He's not being rude. Oliver Stone simply talks about what he wants to talk about. Sometimes that coincides with a journalist's questions; sometimes it doesn't. </p> <p>I try to rephrase the question, but he's off again, on to Italian- Americans in south Florida, mother love, the logistics of cutting films for TV. In life, as in his movies, you sift through the barrage, through the pirouetting logic. Separating the film-maker from his films is impossible. </p> <p>Not least because both have a serious image problem: Stone and his movies are both widely perceived as didactic and overbearing. What is endearing is his naivety about the vitriol that follows in his movies' wake, and the conviction he brings to the screen even when the results prove addled (as in The Doors, or Natural Born Killers). </p> <p>There's a similar naivety in the way that he talks about his private life. Last June, he faced ridicule after being arrested driving through Beverly Hills high on enough medication to open his own pharmacy. Yet he's genuinely puzzled when his reputation for hedonism comes up. </p> <p>\"How do you know I'm a hedonist?\" </p> <p>I tell him you hear stories. </p> <p>\"You hear stories?\" He shrugs. \"Well, I enjoy my life. I don't want to be a pig, but I enjoy my life. And I don't hurt people. I've hurt some people emotionally, but I've never killed or wounded anyone, except in Vietnam, and that wasn't a civilian, it was a soldier. As a matter of fact, I saved a couple of civilians... There's a few things I've been. Hedonist. Moralist. Conspiracist. Misogynist - which I hate because, God, I love women.\" </p> <p>Not film-maker? \"No, never. And if you see the films a second time... I mean, I watched JFK again recently, and some of the technical stuff there is amazing. I will say this in my defence, if you ask people in the street about me, they're all over the place. They say, 'Oh, I like Wall Street but I didn't like Natural Born Killers,' or 'I like JFK but I hate Platoon.' With Marty [Scorsese], everyone talks about Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. With me, there's no consensus. So I think that's a sign of me changing, morphing, taking on different subjects in different styles.\" It takes a moment to realise that he's just answered a question I put earlier. </p> <p>He looks distracted, and seems strangely vulnerable to criticism. He keeps rising to the bait, and can't quite summon up the calm his Buddhism advises. He bristles at charges of marginalising women (which Any Given Sunday, with Diaz doing her best queen bitch, will do little to alleviate). Surely by now he must know what comments to expect? </p> <p>\"I think the women in my films are a little different. I mean, Joan Allen had an Academy Award nomination for Nixon, Juliette Lewis was superb in Natural Born Killers, I loved Hiep Ti-Le in Heaven and Earth [his 1993 ode to Vietnam]. I mean, what higher homage can you pay than to cast an unknown woman, and make the entire movie about her? Of course, as a result, nobody saw it... I still feel there's a racism in America about Vietnam. It's the same with Any Given Sunday. I'm guessing, but if we'd had a white quarterback, a Keanu Reeves, we probably would have made $100m. There's this systematic hostility to the idea of a black man standing proud.\" </p> <p>All of which might sound like evasiveness or self-justification. Until you recall that Stone's willingness to pull up the US on its foibles makes him a pariah in his home country. He's not exaggerating when he says the religious right regard him as a demon. </p> <p>When the time comes, would he rather be remembered as a visual stylist, a storyteller, or - 60s child that he is - a rabble-rouser, a dissenter? </p> <p>\"The greatest compliment I've ever had,\" he says, \"was this one kid who told me he watched JFK 17 times, and it really opened his eyes - not in terms of the conspiracy itself, but more in my saying, 'Think, think about what government feeds us,' what media feeds us.

      "body": "<p>Of course, the most fun are the dresses - backless, strapless and shameless - and the rictus smiles of the nominees, forced to cheer when they lose and clap when they want to cry. Usually there is an extra treat when a winner descends into Gwyneth Paltrow blub or Tom Hanks gush and we can see our own toes curl, live and exclusive at home. Judged on these grounds, this year's Oscars have been a sore disappointment. Cher did not appear in her underwear; Liz Hurley was fully clothed. Kevin Spacey did not sob dry, thespian tears; Sam Mendes did not declare himself \"King of the World!\" </p> <p>As a showbiz event the Academy Awards may have been a let down (at least to the handful of Sky Premier viewers able to watch it), but that should not detract from what happened. For this year Hollywood confounded the critics who dismiss it as a mere junk factory, defied those who repeat the dread charge of \"dumbing down\" - and produced a clutch of substantial, thoughtful films. Those who see the sound stages of California as the propaganda arm of US imperialism ought to think again, too. Far from serving as a glorified advertising agency for the American way, the moviemen have taken pleasure in exposing the darker, uglier aspects of the great republic. Hollywood is getting serious - and, far from blushing at the prospect, Oscar has stood and applauded. </p> <p>Just look at the field for best picture. The winner, American Beauty, is a slick, elegantly-played probe into the dysfunctional reality of apple-pie suburbia. Where once Hollywood might have exported picture-postcard images of domestic life - think Doris Day and Donna Reed - now it lays bare the adulterous, dope-smoking, disintegrating truth. American Beauty shows it all: mid-life crisis and repressed homosexuality, male redundancy and female neurosis, under-age lust and all-too-easy violence. It's no advert for America, and yet its writer, stars and director stand knee-deep in rose petals tossed by their peers. </p> <p>The movies it beat to first place are no less lacerating. The Insider is a detailed, angry attack on corporate capitalism - specifically, the tobacco industry and the television business which bows to it. The Cider House Rules weighs in on abortion and child abuse; The Green Mile squares up to racism and the death penalty. Even The Sixth Sense, the most conventionally commercial of the five nominees - all of which did well at the box office - is an unexpectedly sensitive film. No wonder the New York Times ran its assessment of the Oscar field for 2000 under the headline: \"The US needs more Prozac\". </p> <p>Is that what explains this sudden, self-critical gaze in the Hollywood mirror? Are Americans so depressed that all they want to see at the movies are sadness, estrangement and pain? History suggests the very opposite might be true. </p> <p>Flick through the Oscar record books and you soon spot a pattern. When America is in the doldrums, it yearns for escape and finds it in the cinema. In the teeth of the Depression, Americans queued up for Busby Berkeley's chorus-girl choreography and the singalong fantasy of the MGM musical. They did not want realism: they had enough of that at home. During the second world war, they longed for laughs (Going My Way, starring Bing Crosby, was a rare comedy winner of best picture) or romance: Casablanca took the prize in 1943. In the chilly years of the cold war, there was comfort to be had from Around the World in Eighty Days or An American in Paris. A decade later, after the shock of John F Kennedy's assassination, Americans needed more diversion: top honours in the mid-60s went to My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music. That seems to be the rhythm: Oliver! cheering folks up during Vietnam, Rocky pepping the spirits after Watergate. </p> <p>So much for the years of famine. In good times, America seems to lose its need for sweets, allowing its storytellers to deal in harsher truths.

      "bodyText": "Of course, the most fun are the dresses - backless, strapless and shameless - and the rictus smiles of the nominees, forced to cheer when they lose and clap when they want to cry. Usually there is an extra treat when a winner descends into Gwyneth Paltrow blub or Tom Hanks gush and we can see our own toes curl, live and exclusive at home. Judged on these grounds, this year's Oscars have been a sore disappointment. Cher did not appear in her underwear; Liz Hurley was fully clothed. Kevin Spacey did not sob dry, thespian tears; Sam Mendes did not declare himself \"King of the World!\" As a showbiz event the Academy Awards may have been a let down (at least to the handful of Sky Premier viewers able to watch it), but that should not detract from what happened. For this year Hollywood confounded the critics who dismiss it as a mere junk factory, defied those who repeat the dread charge of \"dumbing down\" - and produced a clutch of substantial, thoughtful films. Those who see the sound stages of California as the propaganda arm of US imperialism ought to think again, too. Far from serving as a glorified advertising agency for the American way, the moviemen have taken pleasure in exposing the darker, uglier aspects of the great republic. Hollywood is getting serious - and, far from blushing at the prospect, Oscar has stood and applauded. Just look at the field for best picture. The winner, American Beauty, is a slick, elegantly-played probe into the dysfunctional reality of apple-pie suburbia. Where once Hollywood might have exported picture-postcard images of domestic life - think Doris Day and Donna Reed - now it lays bare the adulterous, dope-smoking, disintegrating truth. American Beauty shows it all: mid-life crisis and repressed homosexuality, male redundancy and female neurosis, under-age lust and all-too-easy violence. It's no advert for America, and yet its writer, stars and director stand knee-deep in rose petals tossed by their peers. The movies it beat to first place are no less lacerating. The Insider is a detailed, angry attack on corporate capitalism - specifically, the tobacco industry and the television business which bows to it. The Cider House Rules weighs in on abortion and child abuse; The Green Mile squares up to racism and the death penalty. Even The Sixth Sense, the most conventionally commercial of the five nominees - all of which did well at the box office - is an unexpectedly sensitive film. No wonder the New York Times ran its assessment of the Oscar field for 2000 under the headline: \"The US needs more Prozac\". Is that what explains this sudden, self-critical gaze in the Hollywood mirror? Are Americans so depressed that all they want to see at the movies are sadness, estrangement and pain? History suggests the very opposite might be true. Flick through the Oscar record books and you soon spot a pattern. When America is in the doldrums, it yearns for escape and finds it in the cinema. In the teeth of the Depression, Americans queued up for Busby Berkeley's chorus-girl choreography and the singalong fantasy of the MGM musical. They did not want realism: they had enough of that at home. During the second world war, they longed for laughs (Going My Way, starring Bing Crosby, was a rare comedy winner of best picture) or romance: Casablanca took the prize in 1943. In the chilly years of the cold war, there was comfort to be had from Around the World in Eighty Days or An American in Paris. A decade later, after the shock of John F Kennedy's assassination, Americans needed more diversion: top honours in the mid-60s went to My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music. That seems to be the rhythm: Oliver! cheering folks up during Vietnam, Rocky pepping the spirits after Watergate. So much for the years of famine. In good times, America seems to lose its need for sweets, allowing its storytellers to deal in harsher truths. In the post-1945 rush, when a war had been won and America was supremely confident, Hollywood did not revel in jingoism and cheerleading pride. Instead it fretted over alcoholism, the abandonment of war veterans and homegrown anti-semitism in The Lost Weekend, The Best Years of Our Lives and Gentleman's Agreement respectively (winners for 1945, 46 and 47).

The man of the match award went to West Indies' captain Jimmy Adams, who batted for 8 hours for his 101 not out. Adams took it by a nose from the bowler Franklyn Rose, who had four for 93 in the match, made his best Test score of 69 and featured in a West Indies-record eighth-wicket partnership of 147 that turned the game conclusively in their favour. Michael Holding redressed any imbalance by declaring Rose, the principal architect of Zimbabwe's final-day collapse in the first Test that gave West Indies victory in Trinidad, man of the series. All morning the DJs of the Red Stripe Mound chanted the renaissance of West Indies cricket to the tune of the Road March runner-up at Trinidad's carnival: \"Well you wake up in the morning and you just realise/West Indies come back again!\" It was perhaps optimistic and, in the long run, this game is more likely to be remembered for a more appropriate Jamaican dancehall song: \"Who is the big man in ah cricket? Court-ney! Who ah lick down batsman wicket? Court-ney!\"",

Did Julian harbour fantasies about George (or even Dick)? Did Biggles have a crush on Ginger? Of course not. Sex had no place in classic children's fiction (ignore gay readings of Wind in the Willows); books were an escape from hormonal confusion, not an illustration of the dangers and delights that lay ahead. </p> <p>How times have changed. JK Rowling, discussing the next instalment in her bestselling Harry Potter series, said this week that sex is about to enter her young hero's life. \"He's 14 now and has started to realise that girls are quite interesting. I tend to think that if someone is sufficiently engaged in one of the books, he's not going to be too disappointed if, at some point, his hero holds hands with a little girl.\" </p> <p>Perhaps, but where will it all end? One wave of the wand, and anything could happen. </p> <p>Rowling has also promised there will be a death in the new book, evidently seeing herself as something of a taboo-breaker. The sequence was conceived as a seven-volume series and her intention from the start has been to let her hero get older, unlike, say, William who never aged across the 50 years and 39 books in which Richmal Crompton followed his adventures. Some critics, notably Philip Hensher, have dismissed this as a device to hook young readers - Harry growing up with his audience and acting as a kind of magical mirror of their own lives. But the author has convincingly presented it as a means of making a moral point: Harry, the young wizard, has to make his way in the world, prepare to confront the fallen angel who killed his parents, and lose his innocence along the way. </p> <p>\"Harry does grow up,\" Rowling said recently. \"In book four the hormones are going to kick in. I don't want him stuck in a state of permanent pre-pubescence like poor Julian in the Famous Five. And the struggle between good and evil will intensify: there will be deaths. I've thought long and hard about this - I'm well aware of younger readers - but evil is not something you can deal with lightly. There are consequences, there are victims. Children always ask if Harry will get his parents back, but some things, even in the magical world, are irreversible.\" </p> <p>The contrast with Enid Blyton is stark. \"Children's books should be morally sound,\" she wrote in 1949. \"I am out to inculcate decent thinking, loyalty, honesty, kindliness and all the things children should be taught.\" Such sentiments are patronising and irksome yet, oddly, her deathless (and sexless) prose remains hugely popular. The artificiality of her world - predictable, sealed off, with adults treated as a different species - has its own appeal to young readers. </p> <p>Rowling has a difficult trick to pull off: her books sell primarily to a pre-pubescent audience, mainly eight to 12-year-olds, for whom sex is another country. It is highly unlikely that she will introduce lashings of the stuff, in the way that the American author Judy Blume does for a teenage audience, or attempt to confront the darker side of life (drugs, arson, murder) as writers such as Robert Cormier, Melvin Burgess and Anne Fine have. Whatever the publicists whipping up interest ahead of publication in July may suggest, her series will remain more fable than soap opera, nearer Narnia than Neighbours. </p> <p>The confusion over what a children's book should be - whether it should be escapist, as classic children's fiction has generally been, or confront \"reality\", as it often does nowadays - reflects the fact that writing for children and young adults is now split in a way that was never previously the case. Teenage fiction is a post-war invention - Beverly Cleary's Fifteen, published in 1956, is generally reckoned to have been the first of the genre - and is now seen as a way of introducing young readers to adult themes. </p> <p>When Melvin Burgess's award-winning book, Junk, was attacked in 1997, he claimed a purpose for the book no less moral than Blyton's: \"Junk admits a basic truth about drugs, which is that they make you feel good. If it didn't, every young reader would recognise it at once as a pack of lies. It also contains some horrifying detail about heroin addiction, because heroin addiction is horrifying. And it contains, I hope, many shades in between. There is no glamour here. The hope is that by the end, the reader will be better equipped to recognise and deal with the decisions and problems ahead.\" </p> <p>That defence did not satisfy his critics. \"I don't think it's right to encourage children to read about all these very depressing aspects of life,\" said Nick Seaton, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, a parents' lobby group. \"It's no wonder children feel depressed about life and that suicide rates among young people are going up.\" </p> <p>Burgess had the better of the argument, not least because it emerged that Seaton had not actually read the book but had been invited to respond by newspapers anxious to provoke controversy. It is clearly the case that 14- to 16-year-olds, exposed to drugs in their daily lives and on television, should be able to read and understand responsible books about the subject. It becomes more complicated with younger children, and complaints last year about Louise Rennison's prize-winning book, Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging, seemed better founded. Aimed at nine- to 11-year-olds, it took the form of a diary written by a fictional 14-year-old and dealt with lesbianism, incest and the art of kissing. All legitimate subjects, but perhaps not for 10-year-olds. </p> <p>Before the advent of teenage fiction, there was a clear division between children's writing and adult books, and at 13 or 14 readers would abandon the eternal summers of Blyton and Arthur Ransome for the more bracing weather of Dickens or Austen, en route to the storms of contemporary fiction. Children's books did not offer their readers moral puzzles or seek to impose responsibilities on them; good and evil were sharply separated; relationships had little meaning and were defined by the adventures of the protagonists. These were worlds which sought to confirm and protect the innocence of children, and they were often created by middle-aged writers - Lewis Carroll, CS Lewis, Blyton - whose lives were characterised by sexual or emotional repression. Sex was dangerous, relationships demanding, the world beyond the wardrobe frightening. Yet we should be aware of the artifice without dismissing the art. </p> <p>Rennison countered criticism of her book by invoking television. \"Secrecy is the most destructive tool for children. If you try and hide issues from them, damage in the longer term will be greater. East-Enders deals with issues which are far more complicated than the ones I deal with in my book, yet there doesn't seem to be the same outcry about children being allowed to watch a programme like that.\" </p> <p>But soaps are obsessed by sex and relationships, by the need for love, to the exclusion of almost everything else. Albert Square is as doctrinaire and cock-eyed as Narnia. Sex can be much more boring than sorcery, as Harry Potter may discover.</p>",

If it didn't, every young reader would recognise it at once as a pack of lies. It also contains some horrifying detail about heroin addiction, because heroin addiction is horrifying. And it contains, I hope, many shades in between. There is no glamour here. The hope is that by the end, the reader will be better equipped to recognise and deal with the decisions and problems ahead.\" That defence did not satisfy his critics. \"I don't think it's right to encourage children to read about all these very depressing aspects of life,\" said Nick Seaton, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, a parents' lobby group. \"It's no wonder children feel depressed about life and that suicide rates among young people are going up.\" Burgess had the better of the argument, not least because it emerged that Seaton had not actually read the book but had been invited to respond by newspapers anxious to provoke controversy. It is clearly the case that 14- to 16-year-olds, exposed to drugs in their daily lives and on television, should be able to read and understand responsible books about the subject. It becomes more complicated with younger children, and complaints last year about Louise Rennison's prize-winning book, Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging, seemed better founded. Aimed at nine- to 11-year-olds, it took the form of a diary written by a fictional 14-year-old and dealt with lesbianism, incest and the art of kissing. All legitimate subjects, but perhaps not for 10-year-olds. Before the advent of teenage fiction, there was a clear division between children's writing and adult books, and at 13 or 14 readers would abandon the eternal summers of Blyton and Arthur Ransome for the more bracing weather of Dickens or Austen, en route to the storms of contemporary fiction. Children's books did not offer their readers moral puzzles or seek to impose responsibilities on them; good and evil were sharply separated; relationships had little meaning and were defined by the adventures of the protagonists. These were worlds which sought to confirm and protect the innocence of children, and they were often created by middle-aged writers - Lewis Carroll, CS Lewis, Blyton - whose lives were characterised by sexual or emotional repression. Sex was dangerous, relationships demanding, the world beyond the wardrobe frightening. Yet we should be aware of the artifice without dismissing the art. Rennison countered criticism of her book by invoking television. \"Secrecy is the most destructive tool for children. If you try and hide issues from them, damage in the longer term will be greater. East-Enders deals with issues which are far more complicated than the ones I deal with in my book, yet there doesn't seem to be the same outcry about children being allowed to watch a programme like that.\" But soaps are obsessed by sex and relationships, by the need for love, to the exclusion of almost everything else. Albert Square is as doctrinaire and cock-eyed as Narnia. Sex can be much more boring than sorcery, as Harry Potter may discover.",

A report by the London-based human rights organisation says that on average two people are beheaded every week in the desert kingdom, which has increased its use of the death penalty, despite the world trend towards abolition. Alleged robbers have their hands and feet amputated, often after unfair trials. Offences related to alcohol consumption or breaking the strict moral code are punishable with flogging, the report says. Vague laws on \"sabotage\" and \"terrorism\" are used to prosecute perceived government opponents and political parties, elections, independent legislature, and trade unions are all banned, said Amnesty at the start of a six-month campaign to highlight abuses in the kingdom. The report says migrant workers, particularly those from poorer countries in the Middle East, African and Asia, are vulnerable to abuse from their employers as well as from the authorities. If arrested, foreign nationals may be tricked or coerced into sign ing a confession in Arabic, which they may not understand. Migrant workers are frequently tortured and ill-treated, Amnesty says, and are more likely than Saudis to be executed or punished by flogging or amputation. Many expatriate workers exchange horror stories about acquaintances who ended up in jail or were deported for offences ranging from traffic violations to arguments with employers. The report describes how women who go about unaccompanied or are in the company of a man who is neither their husband nor a close relative risk being arrested on suspicion of prostitution. They are terrorised by the Mutaween or religious police who patrol public places on the lookout for \"moral offenders\". The Mutaween shout at women to cover their hair and sometimes their faces. \"The Saudi Arabian government spares no effort to keep its appalling human rights record a secret, and other governments have shown themselves more than willing to help maintain the secrecy,\" says the report, entitled Saudi Arabia: A Secret State of Suffering. With oil prices at their highest in years, the US and other western nations, busy lobbying oil producers to increase output to put a cap on further price rises, are unlikely to rock the boat by condemning Saudi Arabia's human rights record. Home to thousands of US and British troops since the Gulf war, the kingdom has earned itself the mantle of trusted ally of the west, often to the detriment of those seeking to flee its oppression. Hani al-Sayegh, a 30-year-old Saudi who was seeking asylum in the US, was forcibly returned to Saudi Arabia in October 1999. He was detained on arrival as a suspect in connection with the bombing of a US military complex at al-Khobar in 1996 - an offence punishable by death. He continues to be held without access to lawyers and is at risk of being tortured, Amnesty says. Saudi Arabia has one of the highest rates of executions in the world in both absolute numbers and per capita, it says. In February 2000 alone, 11 people were executed. The state executes murderers, drug smugglers, rapists and those convicted of other violent crimes. Amnesty recorded 90 judicial amputations between 1981 and December 1999, but says the true number is probably higher. Amputation is prescribed for causing injury and for theft, punished by amputation of the right hand, and for highway robbery, punished by amputation of the right hand and left foot. Saudi officials rarely respond to the charges of human rights groups. If they do, they deny abuses and say the punishments meted out are based on Islamic law, and that strict judicial criteria and safeguards are applied. But Amnesty says the Saudi Arabian justice system \"from the outset treats suspects as guilty and the lack of independent mechanisms for reporting torture and investigations into allegations have all fostered a climate of fear, secrecy and impunity\". Case studies: Victims condemned without defence Nieves's story A Filipino married mother of two, Nieves worked as a secretary at King Fahd National Guard Hospital in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. She was arrested by Mutaween religious police on 9 November, 1992, while celebrating a friend's birthday at a restaurant in Riyadh. Her group included a married couple and a single man and woman. The Mutaween suspected the group of prostitution after they found money in in the bag of one of Nieves's friends and accused her of accepting the money for introducing Nieves to the single man. They tricked the group into signing \"confessions\", which were used against them at a court trial. Nieves was sentenced to 25 days in prison and 60 lashes. \"I could not describe the pain,\" she said. Nieves was deported to the Philippines immediately after serving her sentence. Abdul's story Abdul-Karim al-Naqshabandi, a Syrian, was arrested, tortured into signing a confession and then convicted of \"witchcraft\" after a secret, summary trial. He had no access to a lawyer and had no opportunity to defend himself, even though he was charged with an offence punishable by death. In a letter to the court, he protested his innocence: \"They did not give me a chance to defend myself. The investigation was carried out by just one person, but they all ratified what he had to say even though they had not heard what I said to him. \"He threatened me with a beating and they tied me up like an animal. I had to sign to protect myself. I signed in the hope that I would find someone in the police who would want to listen to the truth, but I was surprised to be treated even more severely.

He gave information that threw considerable doubt on the case against him, but it is not known how the court dealt with his defence. He was executed on 13 December, 1996.",

      "bodyText": "New York's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, yesterday dropped his bitter feud with a museum over the staging of a controversial British exhibition of modern art selected by the collector Charles Saatchi. The mayor abandoned his attempt to evict the Brooklyn Museum of Art from a city-owned site and to remove its board of directors over what he called the \"sick\" Sensation exhibition. He had tried to cut public funding for the museum after taking particular exception to the work of Chris Ofili, the Turner prize-winning artist whose painting the Virgin Mary was created using elephant dung. Under the agreement revealed this week, the city has agreed to pay the museum an additional $5.8m (\u00a33.7m) over the next two years for repairs and has pledged not to treat it unfairly in future funding rounds. The city has already repaid $3.5m, which it had withheld since the mayor took offence at the exhibition last October. Officials at the museum yesterday welcomed the settlement with the city, which provides about a third of its annual operating budget. Robert Rubin, chairman of the board of trustees, said: \"The events of the past six months have only made our institution stronger.\" The exhibition, which closed earlier this year, attracted record attendances and star-studded endorsements following Mr Giuliani's attack. In return, the museum dropped its lawsuit accusing the mayor of violating the First Amendment, which protects the right to free speech. Mr Giuliani was due to give evidence in the case within the next 10 days. Such an appearance would have come at a difficult time for the Republican mayor, as he has been losing ground to Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival for a US senate seat, in recent days. Weekend opinion polls showed that Mr Giuliani had lost support because of his handling of the police shooting of an unarmed black man, Patrick Dorismond. Following the killing almost two weeks ago, Mr Giuliani took the unprecedented step of unsealing police and court records about Dorismond in an attempt to show a \"pattern of behaviour\" that may have led to his own death. In a further aggravation to local sensitivities already sharpened by last month's acquittal of the policemen who shot another unarmed black man, Amadou Diallo, the mayor commended the police officer involved while failing to offer condolences to the Dorismond's family. At the same time as releasing evidence about Dorismond's previous arrests, the city also withheld the disciplinary record of the police officer who shot him. This subsequently showed that he had once had pulled out a weapon in a bar and had shot a neighbour's dog. Useful links: Brooklyn Museum of Art Office of the Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani",

Another title card: QUIZ KID DONNIE SMITH -TODAY \"This is really exciting,\" he exclaims. \"I bet you don't get many people my age getting braces.\" A dental nurse opens his mouth, holding the imprint for Donnie's brace. She levers it in. \"You were really cute when you were on that show.\" A second nurse stands behind the chair, giggling. \"You can't answer any questions right now though, huh?\" Cut to a close-up of Donnie's teeth. See also: Little Shop of Horrors, Marathon Man, Track 29 Don't see also: The Dentist Pointless trivia: Right at the start of his acting career, William H Macy provided a commercial voiceover for Secret aftershave (\"Strong enough for a man - but made for a woman.\")",

Fall dog lived on rubbish A border collie who fell 60ft down cliffs on to an isolated beach survived for more than a month by eating rubbish washed up on the shore and drinking out of rock pools. A surfer eventually took her to a nearby RSPCA sanctuary in St Columb, Cornwall.",

The MPs are furious over yesterday's Guardian report that the MoD looks set to buy six roll-on roll-off ferries worth \u00a3300m from EU shipyards at a time when yards in England, Scotland and the stricken Harland &amp; Wolff yard in Northern Ireland are trying to win a \u00a3600m ro-ro contract from the Phillipines. Earlier this week the former minsiter, Peter Kilfoyle, used his Commons resignation speech to condemn the \"colonial raj\" mentality of Whitehall officials governing the regions. Yesterday the prime minister cited the presence of so many Scots - 745,000 or 15% of them including himself - who live in England, as well as similar flows the other way, to underline the strength of the British national identity. \"Few would disagree with the qualities that go towards that British identity: qualities of creativity built on tolerance, openness and adaptability, work and self-improvement, strong communities and families and fair play, rights and responsibilities and an outward looking approach to the world that all flow from our unique island geography and history,\" he told the editors. But none of these qualities was under threat as institutions changed - as they always had - to adapt to new times. Quite the reverse, Mr Blair suggested. \"If these values are what makes us British ... then devolution is a necessary part of keeping Britain together. More regional decentralisation in England makes sense, city mayors with real power have their place, hereditary peers in the House of Lords don't, and a constructive engaged attitude to Europe reflects the best of British values of openness and leadership in the world,\" he said. The prime minister argued that Labour's \"progressive programme of constitutional reform is now moving us from a centralised Britain, where power flowed top-down, to a devolved and plural state.\" William Hague was unpersuaded. \"If Hollywood awarded an Oscar for the least convincing performance by a politician, Tony Blair would win it for this speech,\" the Tory leader said.",

Instead we were reaching a diminuendo, a soft, gentle coda in which the main themes were gathered together in verbless sentences, creating mood music which sent the audience into a pleasing, soporific reverie. \"An economy gaining in strength. Pride from a modern constitution that strengthens the nation. \"We are rediscovering our strength and values. We are uniting those values ... to make Britain stronger...\" And so the listeners left, no wiser but much happier, the music echoing round and round in their heads.",

From a low of some 45,000 under Douglas Hurd, we are now at 65,000, with the Home Office itself predicting a rise to around 80,000. New laws just taking effect will help fill the cells with those who breach probation twice. Overcrowding continues despite ever more expensive prison building, with some 12,000 men doubled up in cells built for one. There are two more new prisons for women, many of whom are drug offenders. Prison conditions are better since Labour has spent far more: no slopping out, no stink, a bit more \"purposeful activity\" (up from 22 to 23 hours a week out of their cages, though much of it still doing useless things). Drug treatment and education are improving, but more and better prisons should not be a Labour boast.</p> <p>The head of the prison service, Martin Narey, now worries that magistrates are sentencing many more people to custody because the prisons they see now don't look or smell so bad. \"They may look at the treatment and classrooms and think it's just the job.

He does the best he can with education, psychiatry and drug treatments for his inmates but he stresses all the evidence shows these programmes work far better in the community, with far less re-offending. There are new schemes to divert drug cases away from prison towards community programmes - but the emphasis is still wildly warped. The government spends 62% of its drugs budget on arresting and enforcing the law but only 13% on treatment. Most drug addicts who are arrested have never been offered treatment, which, says yesterday's report, is an argument for more early treatment not for more arrests. But who's listening?</p> <p>Labour has made a Faustian pact. It dares to be redistributive towards the deserving poor, but risks no middle England wrath on wrong-doers. However, deserving and undeserving are often the same families, the children of the poor at greater risk of hard drug addiction. \"What works\" guides Labour's best social policy for the law abiding - but \"what the papers say\" too often guides its policies on crime and prison.

Egalitarian hooligans who want to destroy some of the best state schools in the country care not a jot how much disruption their activities cause. Why don't they just admit that the view of most parents in Kent is that the county's schools do a very good job and should be left alone? Furthermore, instead of allowing small and tightly knit groups of politically motivated activists to plot the abolition of selective institutions, David Blunkett should abolish the anti-grammar school regulations that are causing such disruption and uncertainty.

Held by Syria before Israel's 1967 seizure of the Golan Heights, Damascus adamantly demands its return. Whatever Yitzhak Rabin may once have said, Israel now offers only a withdrawal to the 1923 international boundary. These eight square miles unhinged last winter's Israeli-Syrian dialogue. That breakdown was followed by vicious recrimination. At Sunday's Geneva summit with the US, Syria's Hafez Assad could have revived the process. Instead, his grim inflexibility on Galilee dealt a possibly fatal blow to compromise. Israel's Ehud Barak, weakened since last July by coalition divisions, the Knesset's Golan referendum bill, and rising anti-Syrian sentiment, found he had no leeway left. As he trailed home, Bill Clinton's dream of a presidency-capping triumph looked mortally wounded.

      "bodyText": "A small strip of land on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee is the Middle East's new diplomatic killing ground. Held by Syria before Israel's 1967 seizure of the Golan Heights, Damascus adamantly demands its return. Whatever Yitzhak Rabin may once have said, Israel now offers only a withdrawal to the 1923 international boundary. These eight square miles unhinged last winter's Israeli-Syrian dialogue. That breakdown was followed by vicious recrimination. At Sunday's Geneva summit with the US, Syria's Hafez Assad could have revived the process. Instead, his grim inflexibility on Galilee dealt a possibly fatal blow to compromise. Israel's Ehud Barak, weakened since last July by coalition divisions, the Knesset's Golan referendum bill, and rising anti-Syrian sentiment, found he had no leeway left. As he trailed home, Bill Clinton's dream of a presidency-capping triumph looked mortally wounded.

      "body": "<p>The last time Ibrahim al-Kurd watched his son Ziad play football was from an Israeli jail, and he nearly caused a riot. \"All the prisoners were yelling and crying, and banging on the doors and making a huge commotion,\" he remembers. \"The Israelis came with sticks and gas to see what was happening and I said: 'Look, that's my son on TV.' That's when the guards knew that it was not a revolution.\"</p> <p>That was last summer, when Ziad scored the equaliser against Syria in a match that was played in Jordan. By autumn, Ibrahim was home after serving nearly 12 years of a 25-year sentence for the bombing of an Israeli guard post in which five soldiers were injured, his early release granted under the Middle East peace process. Ziad was still soaking up the glory as the leading goal scorer of the Palestinian national football team.</p> <p>Now during these spring days, when Ziad climbs slowly upstairs after a gruelling practice session before the Palestinian side's international sporting debut - in the Asian Cup in Qatar which starts tomorrow - both father and son have occasion to reflect on the nature of change in Gaza over the past few years.</p> <p>Since the coming of the Palestinian Authority to this heaving strip of humanity on the edge of the Mediterranean, Gaza has existed in a kind of limbo. It is an entity that has yet to declare itself a state, and where basic freedoms do not include an automatic right to pass beyond the Israeli checkpoint to the other towns under Palestinian rule in the West Bank. For lack of a better word, Israelis and Palestinians call it peace.</p> <p>Ibrahim returned to a wall of graffiti on the grey concrete of his four-storey home, declaring the science teacher-turned-bomber a hero. After getting reacquainted with his 10 children, he turned his energies to raising pigeons, and has plans to house 100 pairs on the ground floor. The scars from his interrogation sessions - a smashed wrist and broken ribs - have faded as much as they ever will. Ziad, meanwhile, has been undergoing treatment by an Israeli doctor for a dislocated foot.</p> <p>Neither father nor son finds that strange. But both say the time is not yet ripe for Palestine to play against an Israeli side.</p> <p>Amid such contradictions, football is a certainty, the one true love. In the poor and densely populated Gaza Strip, where everything is coated with a fine layer of sand, it seems every tiny scrap of wasteland has been occupied by boys kicking around a football. \"Every street, every corner in a refugee camp, everywhere they are playing football,\" says Ismail Mattar, the financial manager of the national squad. \"You see kids playing on a beach, with plastic balls, with anything they can find.\"</p> <p>So the excitement over the contest in Qatar is intense. By 10am, when practice starts with a slow jog round a stadium dominated by a mural of Yasser Arafat, \"the paragon leader\", the first supporters are waiting in the stands: truant office workers and pupils.</p> <p>Everyone in the stands recognises that the tournament is about more than football. \"This means the presence of the Palestinian people: that we have our own national team despite all the challenges that we are facing,\" says Ali Abu Ramadan, a student aged 16. \"The team is our ambassador to the whole world. If you are going to make peace, sport has to lead the way. Didn't the Americans and the Iranians play against each other in the World Cup?\"</p> <p>Barring the largely symbolic dispatch of a single long-distance runner to the Atlantic Olympics in 1996, the Asian Cup marks the Palestinians' first serious foray into international sport. Except for Ziad, who says he has no interest in merely serving as a symbol and hopes to play in the World Cup one day, nobody connected with the enterprise pretends the team is actually going to win in Qatar.</p> <p>\"We are a child in the world of football. This national team is just six or seven months old,\" says coach Azmi Nasa'ar. A resident of the Israeli town of Nazareth, Nasa'ar spent 25 years in the Israeli leagues. When he started, he was one of only three Palestinian players, forced to endure the death threats and taunts of terrorists from the stands.</p> <p>Now he says it is a matter of personal prestige that the Palestinian side leave Qatar with their dignity intact. Over the weeks leading up to the tournament, the players have been virtual prisoners in the stadium, released only on Thursday afternoons for the Muslim weekend.</p> <p>\"They sleep, they eat, they train,\" says Ghassan Abdul Ghani, the general manager. He waves his hand towards the white buildings rising from the sand on all sides of the stadium, part of the building boom that has followed peace. \"Even if they live over there, they can't go home and sleep. If they have families, we give them two hours to visit their wives and children, then they are back inside. This is their new family.\"</p> <p>It's a family that represents a coming together of the exiles from the Palestinian diaspora. From the Gaza contingent, some are from the refugee camps, that sprouted here after 1948, and some from town. Like Ziad, some saw relatives jailed during the intifada , the uprising against the Israeli occupation that began in 1987 and led to the beginnings of the peace process in 1993. Others lost their fathers to the war in Lebanon. One player carries the faint tracings of birdshot on his arm, a souvenir of his intifada childhood.</p> <p>Along with coach Nasa'ar, who carries an Israeli passport, is a goalkeeper who was born in Egypt, and players who were brought up in Jordan and Iraq. There is Wisam Abdul Razak, who lives in Sweden and signed on after seeing a story about the team on an Arabic satellite station. As soon as the Palestine team is finished in Qatar, he will leave for Germany, where he is to sign a contract to play for D\u00fcsseldorf. Two more players will join from Lebanon, when the camp moves to Cairo, and if the Israelis lift their travel restrictions in time, two more will join from the West Bank. It took six months for the Israelis to grant permission to the other nine West Bankers who made the squad.</p> <p>None of the players is paid. They have volunteered, content to play in return for their bus fare, basic living expenses and a brief moment of celebrity before returning to their regular jobs when this is all over. Several work for the Palestinian Authority as policemen, earning the equivalent of \u00a3238 a month.</p> <p>By international standards, the budget for the outing is minuscule: \u00a390,000 from October until the end of the tournament. There are no television rights for auction, no jerseys or other merchandise for sale to the fans, no government sponsorship, and little money in ticket sales in a stadium that seats only 7,000. Instead, the team organisers have been asking for donations from local businessmen - and, occasionally, from Arafat himself, who has large funds at his disposal. The budget does not stretch to trainers or physiotherapists but Nasa'ar, despite his experience in the more prosperous Israeli leagues, is undaunted.</p> <p>\"All the time I was playing in Israel I had a dream that I would see a Palestinian country, but I never believed I would be the coach of its team,\" he says. \"Maybe sometimes you achieve your dream. But sometimes you get more than you dream about. This is more than I ever dreamed about and I hope I can give my country the maximum.\"</p>",

Since the coming of the Palestinian Authority to this heaving strip of humanity on the edge of the Mediterranean, Gaza has existed in a kind of limbo. It is an entity that has yet to declare itself a state, and where basic freedoms do not include an automatic right to pass beyond the Israeli checkpoint to the other towns under Palestinian rule in the West Bank. For lack of a better word, Israelis and Palestinians call it peace. Ibrahim returned to a wall of graffiti on the grey concrete of his four-storey home, declaring the science teacher-turned-bomber a hero. After getting reacquainted with his 10 children, he turned his energies to raising pigeons, and has plans to house 100 pairs on the ground floor. The scars from his interrogation sessions - a smashed wrist and broken ribs - have faded as much as they ever will. Ziad, meanwhile, has been undergoing treatment by an Israeli doctor for a dislocated foot. Neither father nor son finds that strange. But both say the time is not yet ripe for Palestine to play against an Israeli side. Amid such contradictions, football is a certainty, the one true love. In the poor and densely populated Gaza Strip, where everything is coated with a fine layer of sand, it seems every tiny scrap of wasteland has been occupied by boys kicking around a football. \"Every street, every corner in a refugee camp, everywhere they are playing football,\" says Ismail Mattar, the financial manager of the national squad. \"You see kids playing on a beach, with plastic balls, with anything they can find.\" So the excitement over the contest in Qatar is intense. By 10am, when practice starts with a slow jog round a stadium dominated by a mural of Yasser Arafat, \"the paragon leader\", the first supporters are waiting in the stands: truant office workers and pupils. Everyone in the stands recognises that the tournament is about more than football. \"This means the presence of the Palestinian people: that we have our own national team despite all the challenges that we are facing,\" says Ali Abu Ramadan, a student aged 16. \"The team is our ambassador to the whole world. If you are going to make peace, sport has to lead the way. Didn't the Americans and the Iranians play against each other in the World Cup?\" Barring the largely symbolic dispatch of a single long-distance runner to the Atlantic Olympics in 1996, the Asian Cup marks the Palestinians' first serious foray into international sport. Except for Ziad, who says he has no interest in merely serving as a symbol and hopes to play in the World Cup one day, nobody connected with the enterprise pretends the team is actually going to win in Qatar. \"We are a child in the world of football. This national team is just six or seven months old,\" says coach Azmi Nasa'ar. A resident of the Israeli town of Nazareth, Nasa'ar spent 25 years in the Israeli leagues. When he started, he was one of only three Palestinian players, forced to endure the death threats and taunts of terrorists from the stands. Now he says it is a matter of personal prestige that the Palestinian side leave Qatar with their dignity intact. Over the weeks leading up to the tournament, the players have been virtual prisoners in the stadium, released only on Thursday afternoons for the Muslim weekend. \"They sleep, they eat, they train,\" says Ghassan Abdul Ghani, the general manager. He waves his hand towards the white buildings rising from the sand on all sides of the stadium, part of the building boom that has followed peace. \"Even if they live over there, they can't go home and sleep. If they have families, we give them two hours to visit their wives and children, then they are back inside. This is their new family.\" It's a family that represents a coming together of the exiles from the Palestinian diaspora. From the Gaza contingent, some are from the refugee camps, that sprouted here after 1948, and some from town. Like Ziad, some saw relatives jailed during the intifada , the uprising against the Israeli occupation that began in 1987 and led to the beginnings of the peace process in 1993. Others lost their fathers to the war in Lebanon. One player carries the faint tracings of birdshot on his arm, a souvenir of his intifada childhood. Along with coach Nasa'ar, who carries an Israeli passport, is a goalkeeper who was born in Egypt, and players who were brought up in Jordan and Iraq. There is Wisam Abdul Razak, who lives in Sweden and signed on after seeing a story about the team on an Arabic satellite station. As soon as the Palestine team is finished in Qatar, he will leave for Germany, where he is to sign a contract to play for D\u00fcsseldorf. Two more players will join from Lebanon, when the camp moves to Cairo, and if the Israelis lift their travel restrictions in time, two more will join from the West Bank. It took six months for the Israelis to grant permission to the other nine West Bankers who made the squad. None of the players is paid. They have volunteered, content to play in return for their bus fare, basic living expenses and a brief moment of celebrity before returning to their regular jobs when this is all over. Several work for the Palestinian Authority as policemen, earning the equivalent of \u00a3238 a month. By international standards, the budget for the outing is minuscule: \u00a390,000 from October until the end of the tournament. There are no television rights for auction, no jerseys or other merchandise for sale to the fans, no government sponsorship, and little money in ticket sales in a stadium that seats only 7,000. Instead, the team organisers have been asking for donations from local businessmen - and, occasionally, from Arafat himself, who has large funds at his disposal. The budget does not stretch to trainers or physiotherapists but Nasa'ar, despite his experience in the more prosperous Israeli leagues, is undaunted. \"All the time I was playing in Israel I had a dream that I would see a Palestinian country, but I never believed I would be the coach of its team,\" he says. \"Maybe sometimes you achieve your dream. But sometimes you get more than you dream about. This is more than I ever dreamed about and I hope I can give my country the maximum.\"",

      "bodyText": "The modern British family may not live up to the happy ideal of the 1950s sitcom, but the truth is closer to the fictionalised families on our television screens than most of us would care to admit, a psychologist claims. While few households would confess to having any similarities with the couch potatoes in the Royle family or with the clean-cut Waltons, both are remarkably similar to many families in Britain, he says. Even if your life may not revolve around a comfortable armchair on a Manchester council estate or, indeed, Walton Mountain, this does not mean that your closest family relationships are not mirrored in another popular sitcom. Guy Fielding, a social psychologist at Oxford University, has argued that there are five basic family-types and all of these are accurately depicted by five of the best known television families. As well as the Royles and the Waltons, typical British families are also mirrored in the cartoon the Simpsons, the Boswell clan in Bread, and in the Porter nuclear family featured in 2Point4 Children. Dr Fielding said: \"These are extreme family types but most families are sitting somewhere in the middle of that grid. None of the types are better or worse, they are just different.\" The Royles, according to Dr Fielding, represent families aiming to strike a balance between the needs of the family and individuals, with strong ties to each other as well as to the daily routine. The Waltons, meanwhile, enjoy routine, always putting each other first while valuing loyalty. For the Simpsons, who value independence, the needs of the individual always come first, while the disorganised Porter family in the BBC sitcom 2Point4 Children, are optimists who encourage debate within the home and thrive on activity and change. For the Liverpudlian Boswells, though, family always comes first and they enjoy overcoming problems together - even if sometimes the demands are overwhelming. Dr Fielding reached his conclusions while researching a guide for Abbey National to help stressed-out families manage their time better.",

But then going abroad to get one is so much hassle: there's all that research to do, and miles of red tape to get through. And how do you say sunroof in Norwegian anyway?</p> <p>So the arrival yesterday of <a href=\"http://www.carbusters.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.carbusters.com</a> which imports cars for you, could be a blessing. Launched by the Consumers' Association, which has been banging on about the \"Great British car rip-off\" for ages, the scheme has been developed and tested since last year's motor show.</p> <p>And because it's all done online, there is no need to move from your workstation, let alone make any nasty ferry journeys.</p> <p>Let's give it a go then. Here are some of this month's specials on the home page. An Alpha Romeo 156 2.0 TS is \u00a315,143 - that's a saving of around \u00a35,000 on the list price. But the delivery time is five months.</p> <p>A BMW 3 series coupe 323 is \u00a322,398.64 (what's the 64p for?), and a Mercedes CLK 230 at \u00a327,898 is \u00a33,692 cheaper than the list price but it will take seven months to turn up. They will have gone out of fashion by then.</p> <p>How about something a little more modest? Like a Mondeo. Here we go, the Instant Quote Generator. Make: Ford. Range: what's this? no Mondeos. Just Fiestas, Pumas, and Focuses. Oh well, make it a Focus.</p> <p>A 1.8 three-door Zetec is \u00a310,538 and the delivery time is three months, which now sounds like no time at all. It may even have to go from Britain to Denmark or wherever and back again. (They can't say where the cars come from - but all are to UK specification)</p> <p>A quick call to the local Ford dealer, Highbury Ford, in Islington, north London, reveals that the list price for this car is \u00a313,000 but Pete might be able to do a special offer.

But then going abroad to get one is so much hassle: there's all that research to do, and miles of red tape to get through. And how do you say sunroof in Norwegian anyway? So the arrival yesterday of www.carbusters.com which imports cars for you, could be a blessing. Launched by the Consumers' Association, which has been banging on about the \"Great British car rip-off\" for ages, the scheme has been developed and tested since last year's motor show. And because it's all done online, there is no need to move from your workstation, let alone make any nasty ferry journeys. Let's give it a go then. Here are some of this month's specials on the home page. An Alpha Romeo 156 2.0 TS is \u00a315,143 - that's a saving of around \u00a35,000 on the list price. But the delivery time is five months. A BMW 3 series coupe 323 is \u00a322,398.64 (what's the 64p for?), and a Mercedes CLK 230 at \u00a327,898 is \u00a33,692 cheaper than the list price but it will take seven months to turn up. They will have gone out of fashion by then. How about something a little more modest? Like a Mondeo. Here we go, the Instant Quote Generator. Make: Ford. Range: what's this? no Mondeos. Just Fiestas, Pumas, and Focuses. Oh well, make it a Focus. A 1.8 three-door Zetec is \u00a310,538 and the delivery time is three months, which now sounds like no time at all. It may even have to go from Britain to Denmark or wherever and back again. (They can't say where the cars come from - but all are to UK specification) A quick call to the local Ford dealer, Highbury Ford, in Islington, north London, reveals that the list price for this car is \u00a313,000 but Pete might be able to do a special offer. How special? \u00a31,000 off but it would have to be bought before the end of the week. Pete's been on the phone for all of 20 seconds and he's already offering a \u00a31,000 discount. It must be hard being a dealer at the moment. But that's still \u00a31,500 more than Carbusters.com. Next step: proceed to Extras Price, and suddenly you are hit with extra costs - a \u00a310 fee for each quote and a \u00a3260 arrangement fee - and offered all sorts of extras like a climate pack (\u00a3513), a CD upgrade (\u00a3119), and a reflex pack (\u00a3263). You then fill out a few details, and within a couple of minutes they've got back with a quote. The Focus is \u00a310,538 plus the \u00a3260: \u00a310,798 (of which 15% has to be put down as deposit) and still \u00a31,200 less than Pete at Highbury Ford is offering.

The parochial church council of the parish of Aston Cantlow and Wilmcote with Billesley sued the Wallbanks, who own the tenented 176-acre Glebe Farm, Aston Cantlow, for the cost of repairs to the Church of St John the Baptist. In a case watched closely by landowners throughout the country, the church claimed it was the duty of lay rectors to pay for repairs to the chancel. At the high court in London yesterday Mr Justice Ferris ruled that the Wallbanks, who live at a sheep farm in Powys, central Wales, are liable to pay for the repairs under the provisions of the little heard of Chancel Repairs Act of 1932. The judged dismissed the Wallbanks' argument that under the European Convention on human rights provisions that \"every natural or legal person is entitled to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions\" and that \"no one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to conditions provided for by law\", exonerated them from liability.

Next Tuesday lawyers for the families will ask the court to declare the cases admissible.</p> <p>Case one is brought by Hugh Jordan of Belfast over the death of his son, Pearce, 22, who was shot on the Falls Road by RUC officers in November, 1992, after they stopped his car.</p> <p>No guns, ammunition, explosives, masks or gloves were found in the car, and he was unarmed.</p> <p>There was no prosecution and the inquest was adjourned.</p> <p>Mr Jordan also argues that the decision not to prosecute and the lack of an adequate investigation are further violations of the right to life.</p> <p>He alleges that his son was denied a fair trial because the shooting was used as an alternative to arrest and trial.</p> <p>In the second case, Jonathan McKerr of Lurgan, Armagh, claims his father, Gervaise, was intentionally deprived of his life.</p> <p>He was killed with two passengers when 109 rounds were fired into his car by a five-man unit of the RUC in November 1982. All three men in the car were unarmed.</p> <p>The facts about the killings remain in dispute despite a number of inquests, three criminal prosecutions and other legal proceedings.</p> <p>The third case is brought by relatives of nine men shot dead during an IRA attack on Loughgall RUC station in Armagh in May, 1987.</p> <p>One was a civilian unconnected with the IRA. The relatives claim the authorities planned and executed an ambush designed to result in the deaths of the men engaged in the attack.</p> <p>They say the authorities, though they had advance notice of the attack, failed to take appropriate care in the control and organisation of the operation, and intended to kill anyone who entered the field of fire.</p> <p>In the fourth case Mary Theresa Shanaghan alleges that her son, Patrick, 30, shot in August, 1991, by a masked gunman in Castlederg, was deprived of his right to life by RUC collusion with loyalist paramilitaries.</p> <p>The Ulster Freedom Fighters, a paramilitary organisation, later claimed responsibility for the murder.</p> <p>The RUC suspected that Mr Shanahan, an active member of Sinn Fein, was a member of the IRA.</p> <p>Mrs Shanaghan claims that a few months before his death, the RUC warned her son that security force documentation, including a photographic montage of him, had fallen from an army vehicle and was in the hands of loyalist paramilitaries.</p> <p>The UK government says the RUC told him the photographs had been lost but not that paramilitaries had them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Four cases alleging that the Royal Ulster Constabulary operated a shoot-to-kill policy and colluded with loyalist paramilitaries will go to the European court of human rights in Strasbourg next week. The cases, which will coincide with the second week of the Saville inquiry into Bloody Sunday, will spotlight other shootings of Catholics between 1982 and 1992, the full facts of which have never come to light. The families of 12 Catholics killed in four separate incidents claim the deaths violated article 2 of the European convention on human rights, the right to life. When the Strasbourg court ruled in 1995 that the UK violated the right to life guarantee when the SAS shot dead three suspected IRA terrorists in Gibraltar, there were calls for the UK to pull out of the Council of Europe, which oversees the court and the convention. The latest cases allege that the deaths of the 12 men were never properly investigated. Next Tuesday lawyers for the families will ask the court to declare the cases admissible. Case one is brought by Hugh Jordan of Belfast over the death of his son, Pearce, 22, who was shot on the Falls Road by RUC officers in November, 1992, after they stopped his car. No guns, ammunition, explosives, masks or gloves were found in the car, and he was unarmed. There was no prosecution and the inquest was adjourned. Mr Jordan also argues that the decision not to prosecute and the lack of an adequate investigation are further violations of the right to life. He alleges that his son was denied a fair trial because the shooting was used as an alternative to arrest and trial. In the second case, Jonathan McKerr of Lurgan, Armagh, claims his father, Gervaise, was intentionally deprived of his life. He was killed with two passengers when 109 rounds were fired into his car by a five-man unit of the RUC in November 1982. All three men in the car were unarmed. The facts about the killings remain in dispute despite a number of inquests, three criminal prosecutions and other legal proceedings. The third case is brought by relatives of nine men shot dead during an IRA attack on Loughgall RUC station in Armagh in May, 1987. One was a civilian unconnected with the IRA. The relatives claim the authorities planned and executed an ambush designed to result in the deaths of the men engaged in the attack. They say the authorities, though they had advance notice of the attack, failed to take appropriate care in the control and organisation of the operation, and intended to kill anyone who entered the field of fire. In the fourth case Mary Theresa Shanaghan alleges that her son, Patrick, 30, shot in August, 1991, by a masked gunman in Castlederg, was deprived of his right to life by RUC collusion with loyalist paramilitaries. The Ulster Freedom Fighters, a paramilitary organisation, later claimed responsibility for the murder. The RUC suspected that Mr Shanahan, an active member of Sinn Fein, was a member of the IRA. Mrs Shanaghan claims that a few months before his death, the RUC warned her son that security force documentation, including a photographic montage of him, had fallen from an army vehicle and was in the hands of loyalist paramilitaries. The UK government says the RUC told him the photographs had been lost but not that paramilitaries had them.",

      "body": "<p>The Police Foundation inquiry into the drug laws is the first report for many years to recognise that the existing laws and penalties for possession of cannabis cause more harm than they prevent.</p> <p>It is also among the first to conclude that tobacco and alcohol are more dangerous than cannabis, although it recognises that marijuana is not a harmless drug.</p> <p>Opinion poll research by Mori for the inquiry, which was chaired by Lady Runciman, also demonstrates that the public sees the health related dangers of drugs as much more of a deterrent to their use than their illegality, fear of being caught and punished, availability or their price.</p> <p>\"All the evidence suggests to us that the law plays a minor part in deterring demand. It is of prime importance, therefore, that the law should accurately reflect relative harm in terms of current knowledge and prevention.\"</p> <p>The report says the recommendations to remove the threat of prison hanging over cannabis users by making it a class C rather than a class B drug, and to reclassify ecstasy and LSD from class A to class B \"will enable the law to reflect more accurately the risks attached to different drugs.\"</p> <p>Far from sending the wrong signal to drug users, the Runciman report argues that this move would create a more accurate \"hierarchy of harm\" and would enhance the law's credibility and the support it can offer to education and prevention. It suggests that if they were classified drugs, alcohol would be class A, along with cocaine, heroin and methadone, and tobacco class B, with amphetamines, barbiturates and codeine.</p> <p>\"We conclude that the most dangerous message of all is the message that all drugs are equally dangerous. When young people know from their own experience that part of the message is either exaggerated or untrue, there is a serious risk that they will discount all of the rest. Recent evidence indicates there is a pressing need to refocus attention on the pre-eminent harm of heroin and cocaine.\"</p> <p><b> Cannabis: </b><br> The report says that long-term use can cause physical and psychological harm, and intoxication can cause danger to others, but it states that cannabis is less harmful than alcohol and tobacco. The law bore more heavily on young people from minority communities in the inner cities, criminalised them to the detriment of their long-term future and therefore damaged police-community relations.</p> <p>The report proposes that the threat of imprisonment for cannabis possession - a crime for which 78,000 people are convicted each year - should be replaced by a system of informal warnings, statutory cautions and fixed fines, with a maximum of \u00a3500 for persistent offenders. Fines should carry no criminal record. The main effect of reclassifying cannabis as a class C drug would be to remove the police power of arrest for possession, although the police would retain the power to stop and search for drugs.</p> <p>The inquiry says the international evidence is that this will not lead to wider use of cannabis. It argues that only education and treatment can significantly reduce the demand for illegal drugs, not any deterrent effect of the law.</p> <p>It also proposes that those who grow small amounts of cannabis for their own use should be fined or cautioned as for possession and no longer treated as traffickers. It proposes changes in the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act to relax the law on allowing premises to be used for smoking cannabis, and the regulations on the therapeutic use of the drug for medical purposes. But it stops short of backing the creation of Dutch-style coffee shops where 15 varieties of cannabis can be bought.</p> <p><b> Ecstasy </b> and <b> LSD: </b> <br>After taking advice from the Royal College of Psychiatrists about the relative harm of controlled drugs, the inquiry proposes regrading ecstasy and LSD. It says they are considerably less dangerous than heroin and other opiates or cocaine. Although ecstasy deaths are highly publicised, they involve fewer than 10 people a year. Not all are directly related to ecstasy and they compare with an annual death toll of 2,100 a year from other illegal drugs.</p> <p>Nor are they as addictive as other class A drugs. The report says that classifying them with heroin and cocaine can give the wrong message to regular ecstasy users that other class A drugs will cause them few ill effects. This change is also backed by the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p> <p><b> Dealing: </b><br> The report proposes much tougher sanctions than the current law on the suppliers of all illegal drugs. It says that despite large increases in seizures there is no evidence that drugs have become harder to obtain or more expensive.</p> <p>It suggests the creation of a new offence of dealing, which would allow the courts to sentence for persistent dealing in drugs rather than an isolated act of supply (for example to a group of friends). A new national confiscation agency would be set up to seize the drug-related assets of convicted traffickers.</p> <p>New sentencing guidelines are needed to ensure the courts take account of aggravating factors such as involvement in an organised criminal group, use of violence or guns, supplying drugs to children or using them in dealing. It proposes harsh penalties for trafficking in class A drugs - 20 years imprisonment compared with the current 15-year maximum - and no change in the 14-year maximum for dealing class B, but the maximum for class C drugs should be raised from five to seven years.</p> <p><b> Drug treatment services: </b><br> The report points to a serious shortage of drug treatment facilities, which receive 13% of the national drugs budget, compared with 62% for law enforcement. It wants to see a rapid shift of resources towards treatment, closer monitoring of private prescribing of controlled drugs to problem users, and new regulations enabling all controlled drugs to be prescribed in instalments to limit the scope for prescriptions to be abused. <b>'Better than being a beer beast'<br>Acid: The only problem is getting supplies</b><br><br> Tony Ross, 36, from Bath has been a self-employed carpenter for the last 15 years and throughout that time has taken drugs.</p> <p>Last March he was convicted of possession and fined \u00a31,200 after police in mid-Wales had caught him with three ecstasy tablets, a couple of grams of cannabis resin and 68 acid tablets named Mandala.</p> <p>He was angry that the police were spending their time trying to catch people like him, who he said, were harming no one. \"We were going to an all weekend rave up a mountain in woodland, four miles from the nearest residents.\"</p> <p>He had been convicted twice before for drugs offences, for possession of cannabis and for growing cannabis plants.</p> <p>He said the only problem drugs had caused him was getting a regular supply: \"I've been self-employed for 15 years.

Hours after it was revealed that Peter Stothard had left the newsroom to work on \"special projects\" for the Times, there were reports that Michael Ashcroft, the controversial Tory party treasurer who was the subject of a sustained campaign by the newspaper, would receive a peerage after all. There was immediate speculation that the two events were linked. Mr Stothard oversaw the newspaper's coverage of Mr Ashcroft's business dealings in Belize, which prompted the Tories' treasurer to sue. The legal action was heralded as the \"libel trial of the century\". Later, after the unprecedented intervention of another national newspaper editor and the Times proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, a deal was struck and the legal action was dropped. The affair was seen to be extremely damaging to Mr Stothard. While the Times's parent company, News International, insisted last night that Mr Stothard \"will be back\", newsroom staff expressed doubt that he would return. The timing of the move, so close to the reports about Mr Ashcroft, was viewed as extraordinary. The Times was recently named newspaper of the year at the What The Papers Say press awards. Two weeks ago, the newspaper underwent a radical redesign with the launch of a tabloid section. There was speculation within News International that Mr Murdoch wanted to reposition the newspaper in the run-up to the next election, and that this could not be achieved with Mr Stothard at the helm. Mr Stothard was said to have looked nervous when he read a statement to staff in his office at noon yesterday. A spokeswoman for News International said Mr Stothard remained as editor but his current deputy, Ben Preston, would make day-to-day editorial decisions. Staff said Mr Preston would be acting editor in all but name. The Times's managing editor, George Brock, will take over Mr Stothard's managerial functions. Mr Ashcroft and Mr Stothard both claimed victory last December when a negotiated libel settlement was announced, though few thought both would survive. The Times insisted it had been vindicated as the Tory treasurer dropped the legal action and declared that he would move his business interests to Britain. At the same time, the newspaper admitted it had no evidence that Mr Ashcroft had been involved in drug trafficking or money laundering. To Mr Stothard's extreme discomfort, the agreement with Mr Ashcroft had been negotiated by Mr Murdoch after Jeff Randall, the editor of Sunday Business, acted as a go-between. Mr Randall has long been touted as a successor to Mr Stothard at the Times, although he has insisted that he wishes to see out another year at his own paper. The Conservatives have nominated Mr Ashcroft for a peerage once before, but he was turned down by the committee that scrutinises the appointment of working peers.

The Police Foundation report said that the penalties for possession of cannabis - among the harshest in Europe - do more damage than the drug itself and called for a reclassification of drug offences. The government, however, rejected the proposals to reclassify cannabis, LSD and ecstasy. A Home Office statement declared: \"The government has a clear and consistent view about the damage which drugs can cause to individuals, their families and the wider community, the link between drugs and crime - and the corresponding need to maintain firm controls.\" The drugs tsar, Keith Hellawell, warned that reclassifying the drugs would do nothing to help the fight against illegal substances and said the proposed penalties for cannabis use were nothing more than a \"slap on the wrist\". The Association of Chief Police Officers said it did not believe there was a need to relax the drug laws, while the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales warned that many of the measures would send out the wrong message to young people. The report by a Police Foundation team which included two serving chief constables, Denis O'Connor of Surrey and John Hamilton of Fife, and which took two-and-a-half years to compile, called for the lifting of the threat of imprisonment faced by more than 70,000 people each year who are arrested for possessing cannabis, ecstasy and LSD, and for a cut in jail sentences for heroin and cocaine possession from a maximum of seven years to 12 months. The inquiry team discussed their findings with the home secretary, Jack Straw, last week. Although Tony Blair and Mr Hellawell rejected the report's recommendations for reclassifying cannabis, ecstasy and LSD, it is widely believed that its findings will prove influential in Whitehall eventually, as Britain increasingly finds itself out of step with the trend across Europe towards more liberal drugs laws. The inquiry, the most comprehensive since the Misuse of Drugs Act became law in 1971, marks a major establishment recognition that alcohol and tobacco are more harmful than cannabis and are so dangerous that they would be classified as class A and class B drugs if they were made illegal. The halfway \"depenalisation\" policy of the inquiry also reflects the wide range of views on drugs among Britain's senior police officers, from the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir John Stevens, who maintains a tough line, to the Cleveland police authority which has called for a debate on legalisation. Lady Runciman, who chaired the Police Foundation inquiry, said that the most dangerous message about drugs was that they are equally dangerous: \"When young people know that the advice they are given is either exaggerated or untrue in relation to less harmful drugs, there is a real risk they will discount everything else they are told about the most hazardous drugs, including heroin and cocaine.\" She said the harm drugs caused was not reduced by imposing harsh penalties for possession and criminal records on young people whose occasional drug use could be tackled more effectively by more credible drugs education.

The report argues that for Britain's drug laws to remain credible they must reflect much more accurately the \"hierarchy of harm\" that actually exists. To class ecstasy as a drug as dangerous as heroin and cocaine was to give the wrong message about the relative harm of opiates to the half a million people who used ecstasy every weekend.

You're right: it's the theme tune to EastEnders, that infinitely recognisable track which drones out into the nation's living rooms three times a week (plus the Sunday omnibus). </p> <p>Without it, of course, EastEnders wouldn't be EastEnders. The homely strains of the opening bars and the thumping drumbeats at the end of each climactic episode add much to the general deliciousness of the Albert Square experience. Imagine Corrie, too, without its familiar old-style jazz intro, or The Bill, or the Nine O'Clock News without its jangly, upbeat signature tune. </p> <p>Theme tunes and incidental music can play a crucial role on TV, but despite this, they often seem to be commissioned in a rather hit-and-miss, last-minute way, and the composers are paid surprisingly low sums. </p> <p>Responsibility usually falls to the producer of each programme to sort out a title track and any incidental music. Depending on budget and time, he or she either commissions a known composer, goes to a music library which supplies off the peg ready-made pieces, or else uses a known song by a famous pop group or musician. </p> <p>The easiest and most common option is to use music libraries, largely because they are time-saving and usually the least expensive. Richard Preston, an independent music producer who worked with composer Simon Fisher Turner on the tune to the recent BBC drama, Nature Boy, explains: \"Libraries commission composers to write pieces of music to specific briefs, such as 'funky with a contemporary twist', or 'millennial', and the end-result is a CD that sits on their shelves. A TV producer will then come along, having just completed, say, a documentary on prisons, and will ask for something 'dark and orchestral'. The library will be able to pull something off for them straight away.\" </p> <p>ITV's unforgettable News At Ten intro, by Johnny Pearson (who also did All Creatures Great And Small), is a classic case of a music library piece. The same process was used to score The Bill, Grandstand and This Is Your Life. </p> <p>Using well known existing tracks can be a frustrating route for most smaller producers, involving endless amounts of time (which they normally don't have) and often vast portions of cash as well as difficult negotations with picky rock-stars via their record labels. </p> <p>Major broadcasters like the BBC tend to commission a lot of original stuff, directly approaching specific composers with briefs such as, in the case of EastEnders, \"something that will bring people in from the kitchen and the garden\". </p> <p>Mike Cobb, the head of music at BBC Worldwide, comments: \"The most popular option here is to commission music, especially for natural history programmes or entertainment or dramas, which rely on atmosphere. We are the biggest commissioner of original music in the UK and there is a rough calculation that we actually commission two new composers every day for either TV or radio.\" </p> <p>While the process of commissioning TV music is rather complex and seat-of-the-pants, the money that is paid out varies enormously. Known composers can command fairly hefty up-front fees, depending on their perceived worth plus the amount of music required. Current hot names, such as Jim Parker who wrote the theme to the BBC's period drama Tom Jones and the intros to Ground Force and Changing Rooms, as well as Murray Gold, who composed the carnival-style title track to Channel 4's Queer As Folk, can command up to around \u00a320,000 for all the music to a six-part drama series, for example. Unknown writers with no track record have to settle for far less. One newcomer recently did the theme and all the incidental music for an entire Channel 4 gardening series for a bargain \u00a32,000.

      "bodyText": "Da da da da da, de da. Da da da da da, da da da, de da da.... Sounds familiar? You're right: it's the theme tune to EastEnders, that infinitely recognisable track which drones out into the nation's living rooms three times a week (plus the Sunday omnibus). Without it, of course, EastEnders wouldn't be EastEnders. The homely strains of the opening bars and the thumping drumbeats at the end of each climactic episode add much to the general deliciousness of the Albert Square experience. Imagine Corrie, too, without its familiar old-style jazz intro, or The Bill, or the Nine O'Clock News without its jangly, upbeat signature tune. Theme tunes and incidental music can play a crucial role on TV, but despite this, they often seem to be commissioned in a rather hit-and-miss, last-minute way, and the composers are paid surprisingly low sums. Responsibility usually falls to the producer of each programme to sort out a title track and any incidental music. Depending on budget and time, he or she either commissions a known composer, goes to a music library which supplies off the peg ready-made pieces, or else uses a known song by a famous pop group or musician. The easiest and most common option is to use music libraries, largely because they are time-saving and usually the least expensive. Richard Preston, an independent music producer who worked with composer Simon Fisher Turner on the tune to the recent BBC drama, Nature Boy, explains: \"Libraries commission composers to write pieces of music to specific briefs, such as 'funky with a contemporary twist', or 'millennial', and the end-result is a CD that sits on their shelves. A TV producer will then come along, having just completed, say, a documentary on prisons, and will ask for something 'dark and orchestral'. The library will be able to pull something off for them straight away.\" ITV's unforgettable News At Ten intro, by Johnny Pearson (who also did All Creatures Great And Small), is a classic case of a music library piece. The same process was used to score The Bill, Grandstand and This Is Your Life. Using well known existing tracks can be a frustrating route for most smaller producers, involving endless amounts of time (which they normally don't have) and often vast portions of cash as well as difficult negotations with picky rock-stars via their record labels. Major broadcasters like the BBC tend to commission a lot of original stuff, directly approaching specific composers with briefs such as, in the case of EastEnders, \"something that will bring people in from the kitchen and the garden\". Mike Cobb, the head of music at BBC Worldwide, comments: \"The most popular option here is to commission music, especially for natural history programmes or entertainment or dramas, which rely on atmosphere. We are the biggest commissioner of original music in the UK and there is a rough calculation that we actually commission two new composers every day for either TV or radio.\" While the process of commissioning TV music is rather complex and seat-of-the-pants, the money that is paid out varies enormously. Known composers can command fairly hefty up-front fees, depending on their perceived worth plus the amount of music required. Current hot names, such as Jim Parker who wrote the theme to the BBC's period drama Tom Jones and the intros to Ground Force and Changing Rooms, as well as Murray Gold, who composed the carnival-style title track to Channel 4's Queer As Folk, can command up to around \u00a320,000 for all the music to a six-part drama series, for example. Unknown writers with no track record have to settle for far less. One newcomer recently did the theme and all the incidental music for an entire Channel 4 gardening series for a bargain \u00a32,000. Another composed the title track to Channel 4's The 11 O'Clock Show for just \u00a33,500, and many musicians will even do it for free in a bid to get known. The biggest way that composers make their money is through repeat fees, which are calculated on a per-minute basis. A piece of music on BBC1, for example, generates a royalty of \u00a348 per minute, while BBC2 pays \u00a346. Channel 4 pays out just \u00a322, but ITV pays a more generous \u00a386, so if a show is long-running or even sold abroad, cash can come rolling in. But still, the amounts generated are not that huge. Simon May, who composed the EastEnders tune, for instance, estimates he only makes around \u00a310,000 per year out of it. \"I'd rather I had a pound for every time I'm asked how much I make out of it than the money I do get\", he says. Writing music for TV idents can pay better. Industry folklore tells of how the bloke who composed the old jingle for Thames TV's logo used to sit at home and watch himself making money, but the overall level of pay seems to reflect how music on TV is generally rather undervalued. Composers and agents complain it is often the last thing that is thought of by the TV production company, when time is running out and money is tight.

      "body": "<p>Ken Livingstone's proposal to raise the finances to rebuild London Underground with a public bond offering could cost the taxpayer an extra \u00a32.3bn, according to a report published today by Labour peer David Currie.</p> <p>Lord Currie argues that the government's favoured option, a public private partnership (PPP), would be by far the most efficient mechanism for repairing the Tube's decaying infrastructure, delivering savings of about 20% on Mr Livingstone's \"naive\" proposal.</p> <p>With transport one of the central issues of the London mayoral campaign, Lord Currie's report is likely to be seized on by Mr Livingstone's opponents in their attempts to erode his lead in the run up to the May 6 election.</p> <p>Under plans announced in March 1998, the government is aiming to establish three PPPs, whereby the public sector retains ownership of the Underground's assets and delivers services to customers, while the private sector takes responsibility for maintaining and renewing infrastructure.</p> <p>Mr Livingstone argues that the cheapest way of meeting the backlog of investment - estimated at \u00a31.2bn - is to issue public bonds. A key advantage of this option is that the government's status as a borrower at negligible risk of default allows it to raise the finances at a much lower interest rate than the private sector.</p> <p>Lord Currie, a professor of economics at London Business School, says this claim is misguided. He said: \"Although the public sector can borrow at a notionally lower rate than the private sector, this is because, unlike the private shareholders, taxpayers are not compensated for the risk they bear.

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone's proposal to raise the finances to rebuild London Underground with a public bond offering could cost the taxpayer an extra \u00a32.3bn, according to a report published today by Labour peer David Currie. Lord Currie argues that the government's favoured option, a public private partnership (PPP), would be by far the most efficient mechanism for repairing the Tube's decaying infrastructure, delivering savings of about 20% on Mr Livingstone's \"naive\" proposal. With transport one of the central issues of the London mayoral campaign, Lord Currie's report is likely to be seized on by Mr Livingstone's opponents in their attempts to erode his lead in the run up to the May 6 election. Under plans announced in March 1998, the government is aiming to establish three PPPs, whereby the public sector retains ownership of the Underground's assets and delivers services to customers, while the private sector takes responsibility for maintaining and renewing infrastructure. Mr Livingstone argues that the cheapest way of meeting the backlog of investment - estimated at \u00a31.2bn - is to issue public bonds. A key advantage of this option is that the government's status as a borrower at negligible risk of default allows it to raise the finances at a much lower interest rate than the private sector. Lord Currie, a professor of economics at London Business School, says this claim is misguided. He said: \"Although the public sector can borrow at a notionally lower rate than the private sector, this is because, unlike the private shareholders, taxpayers are not compensated for the risk they bear. In other words, properly evaluated, the cost of capital in the public and private sectors is the same if the underlying project is the same.\" Lord Currie says the PPP option will be more efficient for a number of reasons, including the existence of stronger incentives in the private sector, the greater ease with which the people involved can be monitored and the existence of clear bottom line. \"The empirical evidence we presented from the experiences of privatisation, contracting out and the [private finance initiative] backs this view,\" says Lord Currie's report. \"In the case of LU, savings from the introduction of the private sector through the PPP are likely to be around 20%, equating to a saving of over \u00a32.3bn over the bond financing option.\" \u0095 The shortlist for one of the three contracts for operating the sub-surface tube lines was announced by LU yesterday.

The Tory-sponsored debate, which is expected to draw cross party support, comes as the Welsh local government minister, Peter Law, is preparing to take action to cap payments that have caused embarrassment and division among Labour party members in the Welsh capital. Eight Cardiff Labour councillors were recently suspended from the party for opposing the controversial \u00a358,000 allowances of council leader Russell Goodway, before being reinstated on appeal to the Welsh Labour executive. The increased allowances, making Mr Goodway the highest paid council leader in Britain, were recommended in a report that measured the jobs of Cardiff councillors against similar jobs in the private sector. The huge increases flew in the face of recommendations contained in separate reports by the Welsh office and the Welsh local government association which suggested linking allowances to the average Welsh wage. Of the 22 councils in Wales only Cardiff failed to take up those recommendations.

      "bodyText": "Twelve ski instructors were killed after a ski slope near the popular Austrian resort of Kaprun was struck by the country's fourth lethal avalanche in just over a year. A local police officer said that 11 bodies had been recovered. Two people had been found alive and were flown out injured, but one died on arrival at Salzburg's regional hospital. At least one person was still missing and, as daylight failed, hopes faded for the skier's recovery. The Austrian authorities said nine helicopters and 80 rescuers were scouring the area around the Kitzsteinhorn mountain. Twenty specially trained avalanche rescue dogs which can sniff out people buried in snow were also being used. The victims were said by police to have been skiing off-piste on the slopes of the mountain when the killer slide roared down in the early afternoon. Witnesses said the avalanche was about 150 yards wide and that it had begun away from the Alpine resort's prepared slopes. Avalanche warnings have been posted in many parts of the Alps in recent weeks as temperatures have risen. Kaprun had seen rain earlier in the day, then sunshine - a combination which is often the prelude to a snow slide. Lying 35 miles south of Salzburg, Kaprun is among Austria's leading ski resorts, with accommodation for 14,000 visitors. All-year skiing is possible on a nearby glacier. The rise in the number of avalanche deaths is a subject of heated debate in Austria. As a general rule, the higher the slopes, the greater the risk from avalanches. Environmentalists have accused the tourist industry of endangering holidaymakers by building resorts and facilities in ever-higher locations to extend the tourist season and circumvent the consequences of global warming. Last December 11 people were swept to their deaths by two snow slides in Austria. Ten months earlier, the country suffered its worst skiing disaster in decades when a series of avalanches claimed the lives of 38 people in the high-Alpine area around Galt\u00fcr in Tyrol. Yesterday the bodies of the dead were flown by helicopter to the nearby Niedernsill sports centre, where they were put in the basement awaiting identification. The Red Cross opened up a counselling centre for victims and their families. Injured people were taken to Zell am See hospital. Avalanche experts warned that the survival chances for anyone caught in the avalanche sink dramatically after 15 minutes. \"More than 90% of victims die through suffocation,\" said Rudi Mair from the Tirolean avalanche warning centre. \"Access to air is quickly lost and only in the case of a quick rescue does one stand any chance.\" Experts said they believed that two snowboarders had triggered the avalanche. A group of ski instructors from Denmark, Austria, Czech Republic and Germany were caught in the mass of snow as it thundered down the mountainside. One of the injured, a 34-year-old Danish ski instructor who had been working for the skiing season in Austria, died after being transported to Salzburg's regional hospital. According to initial reports, a woman skier whose friends were buried by the avalanche was the first to alert the rescue teams. Wolfgang Fizek, one of the heads of the rescue operation, said: \"Two people were able to free themselves from the snow, and we have a constant stream of rescue workers arriving at the disaster site.\" Mr Fizek confirmed that the search had been extremely difficult because of a bad radio connection between the rescue centre and the volunteer rescuers. The avalanche was unexpected. Earlier in the day experts had estimated the avalanche risk to be very low, at number two on the scale. Those caught in the avalanche were very experienced, and were taking part in an Austrian-led international course for ski instructors.",

Investigators yesterday said there were five more suspected graves, after digging up 28 bodies from under the freshly cemented floor of a cult leader's home, the fourth mass grave to be uncovered in a week. As nightfall stopped the excruciating work of pulling the decomposing corpses out with ropes - labour undertaken by prisoners on release from a local jail - many more bodies appeared to remain. Most of the victims had been strangled. Assuman Mugenyi, Uganda's chief police spokesman, said that five other compounds belonging to the sect were still to be examined. The sect had up to 1,000 members and authorities fear most may have been murdered. The latest mass grave was uncovered at the home of a defrocked priest, Dominic Kataribabo, who died in the fire which killed at least 330 followers on March 17. To date, nearly 600 bodies have been found. Police initially treated the deaths at Kanungu as mass suicide, believing followers set themselves alight in the belief that the church was Noah's ark and the Virgin Mary was coming to take them to heaven. Later, when six decomposing bodies were found in a pit latrine inside the church compound, police decided to treat the deaths as murder and rumours began to spread that several of the leaders had escaped. The man believed to have organised the mass slaughter, failed politician Joseph Kibwetere, called himself the head apostle of the Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God. One police theory is that Mr Kibwetere and a former prostitute turned principal prophetess, Cledonia Mwerinde, persuaded followers to sell their belongings and hand over their money in return for a place in heaven when the world ended, on the eve of the millennium. When the world did not end, it is thought that the followers began demanding back their money. Some now contend that the cult's entire existence was a gigantic fraud designed to enrich its leaders - Kibwetere and Mwerinde - who lured the gullible and inadequate into the church with promises of salvation. Cult followers did not mix with their leaders and led a harsh life. They wore a uniform, ate sparsely, refrained from sex and were not allowed to speak for fear of bearing false witness. They also believed their leaders received direct messages from the Virgin Mary and Jesus. Among the bodies recovered yesterday in the pit under the house of Kataribabo in Rugazi, were 20 children. Police said they expected to find many more bodies when they resume work today. A further 74 bodies were found in the garden at the back of the pretty brick house, which overlooks gently rolling hills, a shining lake and the plains of the Western Rift valley in western Uganda. Prisoners wearing plastic gloves heaved the bodies out of the pit, and spread them on the ground for examination by police. \"They look like they have been here about a month and at least half the bodies have been strangled. We will have to wait for the results of our tests before we learn how the others died,\" said police pathologist Thaddeus Barungi, bending over to point out a twist of rope around the neck of one corpse. A total of 255 bodies - most of them women and children - have been found so far on the Rugazi sites and behind a house used by the Ten Commandments cult in nearby Buhunga. The Buhunga site revealed 153 bodies. Local people, pressed in silence against the wire fence of the Rugazi compound, watched in silence as the bodies were brought out yesterday. \"They were religious people.

It was hard to see what was really happening because of the fence which meant we couldn't see inside. And they kept to themselves.\" Kataribabo was a Catholic teacher in the early 1980s. Cult members had been using his home for the last few years. However, in early March followers began leaving the house for their headquarters at Kanungu. Kataribabo was the last to leave, on March 12. His body was one of only two to have been identified by police inside the church: his charred remains stretched out by the door, his dog collar seared into his neck from the heat.",

      "bodyText": "Department store group House of Fraser yesterday insisted it is one of the winners in the battle for high street fashion shoppers . The 51-store chain, whose shares hit a low of 42p last month, unveiled flat full-year profits of \u00a317.8m. But they closed up 3p at 58p as chief executive John Coleman revealed a better than expected start to new trading year, with sales up 5.7% and gross margins up 0.7%. \"We are one of the winners\", said Mr Coleman, whose brands include Army &amp; Navy, DH Evans, Rackhams and Dickens &amp; Jones as well as HoF. \"The board anticipates the current year being one of strong progress\". Analysts believe the backroom improvements to the supply chain made by Mr Coleman may soon bear fruit and that HoF is now stealing market share from rivals.",

      "body": "<p>One small cheer for Link. At least the threat of customers facing a double charge for making withdrawals from bank and building society cash machines has been averted. But the system agreed at Harrogate by Link members yesterday is hardly a model of clarity. </p> <p>Though customers using another bank's cash machine will not have to pay both a \"disloyalty\" charge to their own bank and a surcharge to the institution whose cash machine they use, it is not clear which of the two they will have to pay. </p> <p>The best that Link could come up with is to establish an order of priority - surcharges will take precedence over \"disloyalty\" fees. Nor is it clear how much customers will pay. Barclays has suggested a surcharge of \u00a31. Don Cruickshank who recently wrote a critical report on the banks thinks 30p sufficient. Others have yet to commit themselves. </p> <p>Though the question of how much to charge will be for the individual banks - with attendant risks of lost customers for those whose charges stray too far out of line with their rivals - it is important that customers are not asked to pay too much and that the charge relates to the cost to the banks and building societies of providing the service. </p> <p>One other question is whether new internet banks should be granted access to Link. It would help stimulate competition if they were allowed to hook up to the system but the institutions which have invested in providing the network are entitled to protest about free riding. The banking industry might take a lesson from the telecommunications sector where new entrants have been allowed access to existing networks at a price. </p> <p>If the two sides can not agree they could easily call on the good offices of Mr Cruickshank. He used to be the UK's telecoms regulator and so would have no trouble advising. But given what Mr Cruickshank thinks the banks should charge for cash machine transactions there may be a touch of reluctance to ask for his guidance on other pricing measures. </p> <p><strong> Top coat tarnish </strong><br> </p> <p> BMW's divorce from Rover looks to be rather more damaging to its reputation than to its balance sheet. The final bill - purchase price, cumulative losses and exit provision, less the money from the sale of Land Rover -looks likely to be less than \u00a31bn. That might seem a tidy enough sum, but remember BMW still keeps Cowley and the new engine plant at Hams Hall. </p> <p>Elsewhere the picture looks even less rosy. BMW's says it was forced to act because of continuing, indeed increasing, losses as a result of the strength of the pound and the weakness of the Rover brand. </p> <p>When BMW bought Rover six years ago the pound was around DM2.50. Few would have imagined that sterling would rally to around DM3.20. But if BMW can argue the exchange rate factor was beyond its control, it cannot shrug off the blame for the standing of the Rover brand onto anyone else. </p> <p>Whether the initial decision to buy Rover was wrong or whether the way in which BMW subsequently sought to manage the UK carmaker was to blame is a moot point. There are arguments for suggesting both factors contributed to the demise of the English patient, as Rover came to be called in Germany. </p> <p>The fact remains that while BMW's balance sheet has been dented, its strategy is a wreck. Its efforts to rebuild centre on the BMW marque, which will be extended to include a new model at the bottom end of the existing range, the new mini and, from 2003, Rolls-Royce, most of which it could have been had at much less cost in time and money without getting involved with Rover. The Munich based group is going to have an uphill battle to rebuild its reputation as a smart operator. </p> <p>Nor has BMW escaped undamaged from the row with the British government - which was prepared to back the group's plans for investment in Longbridge with hard cash - over the way in which the dismemberment of Rover was handled. It is adamant that it did not mislead the government over Rover's future, arguing that it gave a series of warnings about the impact the strength of the pound was having on its Rover arithmetic. </p> <p>Though sources in Whitehall yesterday backed up BMW's claims that it gave the government every indication of the seriousness of the situation, the car maker does not appear to have learnt much in terms of public relations from recent events. </p> <p>On Monday the Hungarian government said that talks about BMW investing in Hungary had reopened. Yesterday BMW acknowledged that it had previously looked at building a next generation Rover in Hungary and yes, the same facts should be valid for BMW cars. At this stage, however, the group had no plans to go to Hungary. </p> <p>Perhaps Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orban should prepare himself for a degree of disappointment when he turns up in Munich next month.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One small cheer for Link. At least the threat of customers facing a double charge for making withdrawals from bank and building society cash machines has been averted. But the system agreed at Harrogate by Link members yesterday is hardly a model of clarity. Though customers using another bank's cash machine will not have to pay both a \"disloyalty\" charge to their own bank and a surcharge to the institution whose cash machine they use, it is not clear which of the two they will have to pay. The best that Link could come up with is to establish an order of priority - surcharges will take precedence over \"disloyalty\" fees. Nor is it clear how much customers will pay. Barclays has suggested a surcharge of \u00a31. Don Cruickshank who recently wrote a critical report on the banks thinks 30p sufficient. Others have yet to commit themselves. Though the question of how much to charge will be for the individual banks - with attendant risks of lost customers for those whose charges stray too far out of line with their rivals - it is important that customers are not asked to pay too much and that the charge relates to the cost to the banks and building societies of providing the service. One other question is whether new internet banks should be granted access to Link. It would help stimulate competition if they were allowed to hook up to the system but the institutions which have invested in providing the network are entitled to protest about free riding. The banking industry might take a lesson from the telecommunications sector where new entrants have been allowed access to existing networks at a price. If the two sides can not agree they could easily call on the good offices of Mr Cruickshank. He used to be the UK's telecoms regulator and so would have no trouble advising. But given what Mr Cruickshank thinks the banks should charge for cash machine transactions there may be a touch of reluctance to ask for his guidance on other pricing measures. Top coat tarnish BMW's divorce from Rover looks to be rather more damaging to its reputation than to its balance sheet. The final bill - purchase price, cumulative losses and exit provision, less the money from the sale of Land Rover -looks likely to be less than \u00a31bn. That might seem a tidy enough sum, but remember BMW still keeps Cowley and the new engine plant at Hams Hall. Elsewhere the picture looks even less rosy. BMW's says it was forced to act because of continuing, indeed increasing, losses as a result of the strength of the pound and the weakness of the Rover brand. When BMW bought Rover six years ago the pound was around DM2.50. Few would have imagined that sterling would rally to around DM3.20. But if BMW can argue the exchange rate factor was beyond its control, it cannot shrug off the blame for the standing of the Rover brand onto anyone else. Whether the initial decision to buy Rover was wrong or whether the way in which BMW subsequently sought to manage the UK carmaker was to blame is a moot point. There are arguments for suggesting both factors contributed to the demise of the English patient, as Rover came to be called in Germany. The fact remains that while BMW's balance sheet has been dented, its strategy is a wreck. Its efforts to rebuild centre on the BMW marque, which will be extended to include a new model at the bottom end of the existing range, the new mini and, from 2003, Rolls-Royce, most of which it could have been had at much less cost in time and money without getting involved with Rover. The Munich based group is going to have an uphill battle to rebuild its reputation as a smart operator. Nor has BMW escaped undamaged from the row with the British government - which was prepared to back the group's plans for investment in Longbridge with hard cash - over the way in which the dismemberment of Rover was handled. It is adamant that it did not mislead the government over Rover's future, arguing that it gave a series of warnings about the impact the strength of the pound was having on its Rover arithmetic. Though sources in Whitehall yesterday backed up BMW's claims that it gave the government every indication of the seriousness of the situation, the car maker does not appear to have learnt much in terms of public relations from recent events. On Monday the Hungarian government said that talks about BMW investing in Hungary had reopened. Yesterday BMW acknowledged that it had previously looked at building a next generation Rover in Hungary and yes, the same facts should be valid for BMW cars. At this stage, however, the group had no plans to go to Hungary. Perhaps Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orban should prepare himself for a degree of disappointment when he turns up in Munich next month.",

The government's view is that this is a planning decision the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, can delay until after the election, although this will have consequences for its airports strategy. The view of most observers who followed Britain's longest running public inquiry, which finished a year ago, is that the government will eventually approve Terminal 5. It is almost certainly bound to do so in view of the increasing number of people who want to fly, demonstrated by the 5% annual growth in air traffic. But limits will be placed on the number of aircraft, such as the one preparing to land above, able to use the terminal and on night flights. Even so, it would bring hostile reaction from a public sceptical of past promises. It was told that Heathrow's Terminal 4 would be the final extension to the world's busiest international airport.",

Bourne's outrageously entertaining shows drew on traditions of showbiz, classical ballet and film, and rapidly attracted a public far wider than hard-core dance fans. Inevitably, the scale of the productions grew too. In 1992 Bourne was commissioned by Opera North to create a radical version of the Nutcracker, and went on to choreograph lavish rewrites of Swan Lake and Cinderella. With stars from the Royal Ballet guesting in his shows, sell-out seasons in the West End and on Broadway, and a clutch of awards, Bourne's company redefined what an independent dance theatre group could aspire to. </p> <p>Now AMP has outdone itself with the announcement that it will be moving into London's Old Vic theatre as company-in-residence from 2002. With privileged use of the stage and permanent rehearsal and administrative facilities, AMP is set to become the only major British dance company apart from the two Royal Ballet companies with its own base and theatre. </p> <p>AMP's producer Katharine Dor\u00e9 had been looking for \"a permanent relationship with a theatre\" for the past couple of years. \"I'd been trying to settle Matt down for a while,\" she says. Until now Bourne and his dancers have rehearsed in gypsy conditions, \"three weeks in one studio, three weeks somewhere else\" - a huge waste of time and energy. </p> <p>By the end of this decade Bourne plans to have six to eight of his works playing in repertory at the Old Vic. These will include Highland Fling (his lager-fuelled update of La Sylphide), Cinderella and the Nutcracker, the new work Car Man and at least two other new productions. The all-male Swan Lake will occasionally be revived at larger venues. When the company is in rehearsal or on tour, other dance and theatre events will be programmed (though Bourne hopes to have some input into their selection). Essentially, AMP will have the same connection to the Old Vic as English National Opera does to the Coliseum. </p> <p>This plan guarantees Bourne a fabulous showcase for his choreography, yet he's more excited by what it will do for his dancers, since AMP will at last become a full-time company. As Bourne has only ever worked on a project-to-project basis, many of his dancers have been inactive for weeks each year. Now he's able to offer every AMP member a career. \"I can really bring on the younger dancers, and use everyone properly. We can also start holding workshops and summer schools, so that AMP can feed back into the dance community.\" </p> <p>Bourne and Dor\u00e9 also plan to stage a musical version of Edward Scissorhands. \"AMP is just me and Matt and whatever we want to do,\" says Dor\u00e9. </p> <p>The Old Vic will keep them grounded, though, and Bourne says it's perfect for most of the company's needs. \"It has an intimacy that suits our work, plus it has all the facilities we need, like an orchestra pit. It's like a mini opera house. I love it.\" </p> <p>But if dance has gained a major venue, isn't it at the expense of straight theatre? The Old Vic has for decades been associated with high-class drama, most recently when Peter Hall attempted to launch a repertory company there. When the Arts Council failed to back that venture, many mourned the loss of a rich opportunity. Since his departure, says Guardian critic Michael Billington, the Old Vic \"has just been lurching from one thing to the next. It needed something with vision and money to fill the gap, and AMP will certainly bring in those.\" </p> <p>Theatre fans may feel that an illustrious tradition will die when AMP moves into the Vic, yet for the dance world this is a homecoming. The Royal Ballet gave its first seasons under Lilian Baylis and Ninette de Valois there, and Bourne is thrilled by this. \"Sitting in the office where Baylis and de Valois once sat really appeals.
