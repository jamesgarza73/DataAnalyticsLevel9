Some 1.1m of these people will receive an additional allocation of shares based on the size of their policy and how long they have held it for. </p> <p>Friends Provident refused to give an average windfall figure, saying this would be misleading, but examples it gave suggested that someone who had paid \u00a350 a month into a with-profits pension or endowment policy for 15-20 years might expect to receive shares worth around \u00a34,000-\u00a36,500. </p> <p>It was a year ago this week that Friends Provident, founded by Quakers in 1832, announced its intention to demutualise. The company, headed by chief executive Keith Satchell, is a leading player in personal pensions and ethical investment and has \u00a338bn of assets under management. </p> <p>Undeterred by the recent stock market volatility, it has decided to seek a London Stock Exchange listing on July 9. Merrill Lynch, the group's adviser, indicated that, had the shares been trading on April 25, they would have been worth between 225p and 270p. </p> <p>Friends Provident intends to raise about \u00a31.4bn of new capital through a share offer to institutional investors and others.

      "bodyText": "Mutual insurance group Friends Provident is likely to have a market value of between \u00a33.7bn and \u00a34.2bn when it floats on the stock market on July 9 - big enough to propel it into the FTSE 100 index, it said yesterday. The demutualisation of the 169-year-old company will release windfalls to 1.7m members, several hundred thousand of whom will receive free shares worth well over \u00a31,000. Provided the flotation is approved next month, all of the 1.7m members will receive 200 free shares, which according to the company's estimate would be worth up to \u00a3540. Some 1.1m of these people will receive an additional allocation of shares based on the size of their policy and how long they have held it for. Friends Provident refused to give an average windfall figure, saying this would be misleading, but examples it gave suggested that someone who had paid \u00a350 a month into a with-profits pension or endowment policy for 15-20 years might expect to receive shares worth around \u00a34,000-\u00a36,500. It was a year ago this week that Friends Provident, founded by Quakers in 1832, announced its intention to demutualise. The company, headed by chief executive Keith Satchell, is a leading player in personal pensions and ethical investment and has \u00a338bn of assets under management. Undeterred by the recent stock market volatility, it has decided to seek a London Stock Exchange listing on July 9. Merrill Lynch, the group's adviser, indicated that, had the shares been trading on April 25, they would have been worth between 225p and 270p. Friends Provident intends to raise about \u00a31.4bn of new capital through a share offer to institutional investors and others. Members and other customers will be able to buy extra shares on preferential terms. David Newbigging, the group's chairman, said the planned flotation would provide the company with increased financial flexibility. \"This will allow easier access to external capital and improve our financial strength,\" he said. The company indicated it might go on the hunt for acquisitions. It said flotation would enable it to raise the additional finance required to \"take advantage of future development opportunities, such as the growth in the pensions market and acquisitions\". The demutualisation will require the approval of 75% of those members who vote. Postal voting will be taking place in the coming weeks and members will also be able to vote in person at the extraordinary general meeting on June 6, at which the result will be announced. Members of mutual insurer Scottish Provident are also in line for windfall payments of at least \u00a3500 if more than three quarters of them vote next month on a proposed takeover by Abbey National. The Scottish Provident board has recommended the takeover after Abbey agreed last year to pay \u00a31.8bn. The insurer said yesterday it would be sending out voting details over the next few days to its 440,000 members ahead of an extraordinary general meeting set for June 14 in Edinburgh. Managing director David Woods said the deal would be unaffected by the proposed takeover of Abbey by Lloyds TSB. He said with-profits policyholders would receive additional payments, expected at the end of the year, averaging about \u00a33,400, although some payments could exceed \u00a3100,000.",

      "body": "<p>Christopher Hampton's eminently revivable play is a latterday Sunset Boulevard. But instead of a drifting hack meeting a marooned legend we see the Hungarian dramatist Odon von Horvath fictively and wittily projected into a post-1938 Hollywood packed with European emigres. </p> <p>The real Horvath was killed in a freak accident on a Paris boulevard. But here he goes to Hollywood and becomes the archetypal Hampton hero: a detached, ironic observer encountering the ideological certainties of Bertolt Brecht and wanly contrasting the impoverished neglect of Heinrich Mann with the acclaim accorded his ponderously self-important brother, Thomas. The play both offers a vivid picture of wartime Hollywood where literary legends became studio hacks, and sharply counterpoints European experience with America's \"tragic innocence\". </p> <p>The juiciest scenes in the play involve the collisions between Horvath and Brecht. The former believes a writer's primary duty is to interpret the world; the latter that it is his job to change it. Although Hampton's sympathies lie with Horvath, he endows Brecht with a bulldozing energy and wit that allow him to dominate every scene he is in. Brecht's detestation of Thomas Mann, contempt for America's \"depraved cuteness\" and conviction that he and Chaplin are the only first-rate directors are not only very funny but symbols of his iron certainty. And it's a sign of Hampton's maturity that he gives many of the best lines to the writer with whom he is least in sympathy. </p> <p>What I noticed in John Crowley's production, more than in Gordon Davidson's in Los Angeles in 1982 or Peter Gill's at the National, is that the play is also about the melancholy of exile. Horvath himself happily adjusts to Hollywood's ebullient freakishness. But Hampton writes with real compassion about Heinrich Mann who, having written the original Blue Angel, is turned into a Burbank wage-slave, and about his wife, Nelly, who becomes an alcoholic wreck. Even the Olympian Thomas Mann is a prophet without a pulpit. For some Hollywood may have been a temporary paradise.

      "bodyText": "Christopher Hampton's eminently revivable play is a latterday Sunset Boulevard. But instead of a drifting hack meeting a marooned legend we see the Hungarian dramatist Odon von Horvath fictively and wittily projected into a post-1938 Hollywood packed with European emigres. The real Horvath was killed in a freak accident on a Paris boulevard. But here he goes to Hollywood and becomes the archetypal Hampton hero: a detached, ironic observer encountering the ideological certainties of Bertolt Brecht and wanly contrasting the impoverished neglect of Heinrich Mann with the acclaim accorded his ponderously self-important brother, Thomas. The play both offers a vivid picture of wartime Hollywood where literary legends became studio hacks, and sharply counterpoints European experience with America's \"tragic innocence\". The juiciest scenes in the play involve the collisions between Horvath and Brecht. The former believes a writer's primary duty is to interpret the world; the latter that it is his job to change it. Although Hampton's sympathies lie with Horvath, he endows Brecht with a bulldozing energy and wit that allow him to dominate every scene he is in. Brecht's detestation of Thomas Mann, contempt for America's \"depraved cuteness\" and conviction that he and Chaplin are the only first-rate directors are not only very funny but symbols of his iron certainty. And it's a sign of Hampton's maturity that he gives many of the best lines to the writer with whom he is least in sympathy. What I noticed in John Crowley's production, more than in Gordon Davidson's in Los Angeles in 1982 or Peter Gill's at the National, is that the play is also about the melancholy of exile. Horvath himself happily adjusts to Hollywood's ebullient freakishness. But Hampton writes with real compassion about Heinrich Mann who, having written the original Blue Angel, is turned into a Burbank wage-slave, and about his wife, Nelly, who becomes an alcoholic wreck. Even the Olympian Thomas Mann is a prophet without a pulpit. For some Hollywood may have been a temporary paradise. But, in a brilliant Hampton phrase, it is an \"Eden paid for out of other men's dreams\". Crowley's production, set in an empty swimming pool, also contains a number of fine performances. Ben Daniels's Horvath has exactly the right quality of amused detachment and there is first-rate support from Phil Davis as a chippy Brecht sockless in Santa Monica, Richard Johnson as a Heinrich Mann wreathed in melancholy dignity, Lizzy McInnerny as his blowsily boozy wife and Gawn Grainger as his self-satisfied brother. Hampton went on to script the musical of Sunset Boulevard; this exhilarating play is infinitely closer to the original's bittersweet spirit. \u0095 Until June 23. Box office: 020-7369 1732.

In short, Franti is a star. His muse, although diluted by Spearhead's unnecessary soloing, is strong too. The threat of the opening track Oh My God (which recalls Gil Scott-Heron) is soon dissipated by Franti's incessant exhortations to \"party\". People in tha Middle offers a thoughtful good time, Stay Human (All the Freaky People) almost takes a delightful turn into The Sound of Music, and Home is a swiftly dispensed but beautifully delivered lullaby. We Don't Mind is new to the audience, but by its climax Franti is conducting a mass singalong of its chorus. During Sometimes, right at the death, Franti suggests everyone raise their hands and embrace \"positive energy\". It is hackneyed, but the response is as frenzied as Metallica's mosh pit and so loud it drowns out the band. Franti himself pogos ever more frantically, before bouncing off stage. \"This,\" he notes breathlessly by way of a parting shot, \"has been special.\" He has a point.",

      "body": "<p>Friends Provident cheerily believes that its 169-year independence is not going to be compromised just because it is demutualising and heading on to the stock market. Yesterday it confidently predicted that it will jump straight into the FTSE 100 index of Britain's biggest companies and, armed with \u00a31.4bn in extra cash, go on the acquisition trail. </p> <p>It is the same story retailed by the mortgage banks such as Northern Rock, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Woolwich when they floated, and they soon got found out. The market started asking just what medium-sized free-floating financials are for. Not big enough to be attractive to an international buyer, not small enough to be a niche provider, their share prices head south. </p> <p>Friends Provident is in the same trap. Its expected market cap of \u00a34bn puts it at a quarter of the size of Prudential, a fifth of CGNU. Even Legal &amp; General, permanently on the look-out for a takeover partner since its deal with NatWest fell apart, is twice the size of Friends. </p> <p>When Scottish Amicable, a company similar in size to Friends Provident, tried to make a go of independence, its plans were scoffed at and it eventually opted for takeover by Prudential instead. </p> <p>Friends Provident also comes to the market at the worst possible time for pension sellers. The new \"stakeholder\" world has slashed charges to 1% a year compared with the much higher levels enjoyed in the past. The mortgage banks saw their backbook margins ravaged by remortgaging and their frontbook by intense price competition. The insurers face a similar double hit from lower margins on existing business and loss-leading on stakeholder pensions. Privately, the big insurers admits that their stakeholder plans won't come into profit until after 13-14 years. Prudential might have the pockets - and the stomach - for it. Friends Provident does not. </p> <p>If the 1.7m mutual members of Friends believe its management is \"determined\" to remain independent, they should sell their shares as soon as they receive them. The best they can hope is that a benign bank seeks them out, in the way that Barclays took over Woolwich. Unfortunately, there are a dwindling number of banks that have not already found their pensions partner, or, like Lloyds TSB, are wondering if they paid too much. </p> <p><strong> Safe bet </strong><br> </p> <p>Life is rarely dull at British Biotech, which yesterday threw up the unusual scenario of a chief executive expressing \"surprise\" that one of his products was working. </p> <p>The biotech company's boss, Elliot Goldstein, executed a screeching u-turn by backing marimastat, the firm's controversial cancer drug which has been in and out of favour more often than Stan Collymore. </p> <p>His decision is a sensible one - the drug is, at last, showing useful signs in a trial on pancreatic cancer patients. An analysis of survivors from a two-year-old study on gastric cancer is equally promising. </p> <p>Goldstein has had a tough job balancing calls from the City to axe the drug with his scientists' instinct that it is working. Critics suggested he should have ordered more trials following the initial semi-successful gastric cancer results in 1999. But that would have been a tough call to justify to investors. </p> <p>British Biotech is now in the bizarre position of contemplating an immediate application for regulatory approval of a drug it wrote off in February. If marimastat ever reaches the market, it will be the safest medicine available, having been through a remarkably long-winded, if slightly shambolic, series of clinical studies. </p> <p><strong> Stop start </strong><br> </p> <p>So, back to normality in the City. On with the suit, off with that daft stuff from the Austin Reed casual range. The May Day would-be rioters gave the Square Mile a wide berth this time round. </p> <p>Yet a growing body of commentators view the anti-capitalist movement as becoming an increasingly mainstream force: big corporates are bad, full stop, and globalisation allows these profit-seeking beasts to pillage the entire earth, so let's protest. </p> <p>\"Increasingly fashionable\" would be a better description. Many of the current combatants seem to believe they are on to something new. Some have even happened across the idea of disrupting companies' annual general meetings, as if company chairmen haven't spent 20 years learning how to deal with problem questions at AGMs. </p> <p>Capital, meanwhile, has been global since it was invented - it is just that it moves faster nowadays. Even the Reclaim the Streets movement is showing its age, having roots in the Stop the City carnival of the early 1980s. Its greying founders have ended up doing things like editing the financial sections of national newspapers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Friends Provident cheerily believes that its 169-year independence is not going to be compromised just because it is demutualising and heading on to the stock market. Yesterday it confidently predicted that it will jump straight into the FTSE 100 index of Britain's biggest companies and, armed with \u00a31.4bn in extra cash, go on the acquisition trail. It is the same story retailed by the mortgage banks such as Northern Rock, Alliance &amp; Leicester and Woolwich when they floated, and they soon got found out. The market started asking just what medium-sized free-floating financials are for. Not big enough to be attractive to an international buyer, not small enough to be a niche provider, their share prices head south. Friends Provident is in the same trap. Its expected market cap of \u00a34bn puts it at a quarter of the size of Prudential, a fifth of CGNU. Even Legal &amp; General, permanently on the look-out for a takeover partner since its deal with NatWest fell apart, is twice the size of Friends. When Scottish Amicable, a company similar in size to Friends Provident, tried to make a go of independence, its plans were scoffed at and it eventually opted for takeover by Prudential instead. Friends Provident also comes to the market at the worst possible time for pension sellers. The new \"stakeholder\" world has slashed charges to 1% a year compared with the much higher levels enjoyed in the past. The mortgage banks saw their backbook margins ravaged by remortgaging and their frontbook by intense price competition. The insurers face a similar double hit from lower margins on existing business and loss-leading on stakeholder pensions. Privately, the big insurers admits that their stakeholder plans won't come into profit until after 13-14 years. Prudential might have the pockets - and the stomach - for it. Friends Provident does not. If the 1.7m mutual members of Friends believe its management is \"determined\" to remain independent, they should sell their shares as soon as they receive them. The best they can hope is that a benign bank seeks them out, in the way that Barclays took over Woolwich. Unfortunately, there are a dwindling number of banks that have not already found their pensions partner, or, like Lloyds TSB, are wondering if they paid too much. Safe bet Life is rarely dull at British Biotech, which yesterday threw up the unusual scenario of a chief executive expressing \"surprise\" that one of his products was working. The biotech company's boss, Elliot Goldstein, executed a screeching u-turn by backing marimastat, the firm's controversial cancer drug which has been in and out of favour more often than Stan Collymore. His decision is a sensible one - the drug is, at last, showing useful signs in a trial on pancreatic cancer patients. An analysis of survivors from a two-year-old study on gastric cancer is equally promising. Goldstein has had a tough job balancing calls from the City to axe the drug with his scientists' instinct that it is working. Critics suggested he should have ordered more trials following the initial semi-successful gastric cancer results in 1999. But that would have been a tough call to justify to investors. British Biotech is now in the bizarre position of contemplating an immediate application for regulatory approval of a drug it wrote off in February. If marimastat ever reaches the market, it will be the safest medicine available, having been through a remarkably long-winded, if slightly shambolic, series of clinical studies. Stop start So, back to normality in the City. On with the suit, off with that daft stuff from the Austin Reed casual range. The May Day would-be rioters gave the Square Mile a wide berth this time round. Yet a growing body of commentators view the anti-capitalist movement as becoming an increasingly mainstream force: big corporates are bad, full stop, and globalisation allows these profit-seeking beasts to pillage the entire earth, so let's protest. \"Increasingly fashionable\" would be a better description. Many of the current combatants seem to believe they are on to something new. Some have even happened across the idea of disrupting companies' annual general meetings, as if company chairmen haven't spent 20 years learning how to deal with problem questions at AGMs. Capital, meanwhile, has been global since it was invented - it is just that it moves faster nowadays. Even the Reclaim the Streets movement is showing its age, having roots in the Stop the City carnival of the early 1980s. Its greying founders have ended up doing things like editing the financial sections of national newspapers.",

And Ian Lindsay gives a grave and tender performance as the ageing eye specialist Rice, whose promising career has somehow faded into white hair and whisky but might be resuscitated by his miracle-cure of Molly. Director Roger Haines hits the right note of understatement for this delicate work. The production is enhanced by the swirling, retinal tracery of Judith Croft's projected designs, which trickle like the capillary patterns of the mind's eye. \u0095 Until May 19.

Several Third Division (old) players have played for England, including Tommy Lawton (four times during 1948-1949 while at Third Division South side Notts County); Reg Matthews (five times in 1956-7 while at Third Division South side Coventry City) and the late Johnny \"Budgie\" Byrne, who played once for England while at Third Division Crystal Palace in 1962, before moving to West Ham.</p> <p>Going back further still, there are also several non-league players who have proudly worn the three lions on their chest. Bert Coleman, of Isthmain League side Dulwich Hamlet, won an England cap against Wales in 1921, while Edgar Kail (also of Dulwich) won three caps against France, Belgium and Spain in 1929. Meanwhile, Bernard Joy of Corinthians earned his only cap and became the last amateur to play for the senior England team in the 3-2 loss to Belgium in Brussels on May 9 1936.</p> <p>Thanks to Mark Price, Mark Neale and Seamus20 for their help.</p> <p><strong>NOSE-BLEEDS OVER THE HALFWAY LINE</strong></p> <p><strong>Excluding goalkeepers, what is the longest stretch of games a player has played without scoring for his own team?</strong> asks David Bates.</p> <p>The first name which sprang to mind was Rob Jones, the Liverpool right-back, who famously turned out 243 times for the Reds without once sending the net billowing.</p> <p>Then we thought of Southampton defender Francis Benali, who played 284 times for Southampton before stunning the Dell with a purler against Leicester in 1997. (He celebrated by getting two yellow cards and a red in his next five matches.)</p> <p>And then we thought well, this is sure to be the tip of the iceberg, isn't it? There's bound to be someone in the mists of time who concentrated so hard on marshalling a defence that he went 600 games without scoring. But who is it?

      "bodyText": "LOWER-DIVISION PLAYERS WHO HAVE PLAYED FOR ENGLAND \"Everyone remembers that Steve Bull played for England despite not playing in the top league,\" remembers David Cassidy. \"But I'd like to know which is the lowest division a player has ever been selected from to represent: a) England and b) a top ranking international side.\" We can certainly help you with the first part of the question, David. Several Third Division (old) players have played for England, including Tommy Lawton (four times during 1948-1949 while at Third Division South side Notts County); Reg Matthews (five times in 1956-7 while at Third Division South side Coventry City) and the late Johnny \"Budgie\" Byrne, who played once for England while at Third Division Crystal Palace in 1962, before moving to West Ham. Going back further still, there are also several non-league players who have proudly worn the three lions on their chest. Bert Coleman, of Isthmain League side Dulwich Hamlet, won an England cap against Wales in 1921, while Edgar Kail (also of Dulwich) won three caps against France, Belgium and Spain in 1929. Meanwhile, Bernard Joy of Corinthians earned his only cap and became the last amateur to play for the senior England team in the 3-2 loss to Belgium in Brussels on May 9 1936. Thanks to Mark Price, Mark Neale and Seamus20 for their help. NOSE-BLEEDS OVER THE HALFWAY LINE Excluding goalkeepers, what is the longest stretch of games a player has played without scoring for his own team? asks David Bates. The first name which sprang to mind was Rob Jones, the Liverpool right-back, who famously turned out 243 times for the Reds without once sending the net billowing. Then we thought of Southampton defender Francis Benali, who played 284 times for Southampton before stunning the Dell with a purler against Leicester in 1997. (He celebrated by getting two yellow cards and a red in his next five matches.) And then we thought well, this is sure to be the tip of the iceberg, isn't it? There's bound to be someone in the mists of time who concentrated so hard on marshalling a defence that he went 600 games without scoring. But who is it? Over to you - email the.boss@theguardian.com with names and stats.

In a long and eventful life as researcher, writer and teacher, she inspired generations of students and colleagues with her humanistic ideals, her kindliness and her devotion to scientific methods in social research. Throughout her career, she focused on problem-oriented research, leaving the laboratory to study social issues, including racial discrimination, anti-semitism, the mental impacts of poverty, crime and pornography, social-class inequities and nationalism. Marie was born in Vienna, to Carl and Betty Jahoda, and there were three distinct periods in her life: her childhood and youth in Austria; her emigration, wartime experiences and academic career in Britain and the United States; and, finally, an active period of nominal retirement with the science policy research unit (SPRU) at Sussex.

Huddled disbelieving in the rain numbed by the same sense of shock you last felt the day Diana died, laying wreaths outside your local RAB office, or leading a protest prayer meeting outside the Arts Council headquarters in Great Peter Street?</p> <p>Surely you were moved enough to write to your MP to rail at how New Labour was once again preaching devolution and practicing centralisation? Had not another of Tony's business cronies - in this case that \"jumped up caterer\" Gerry Robinson, the Granada chairman whose name sends a chill through every Little Chef in the land - been let loose with an axe on our cherished public services?</p> <p>Or, like all but a handful of the population, you might simply have wondered what on earth regional arts boards were, and what were they for. Indeed, that last question has been never far from the mind of anyone who has had anything to do with them over the past 11 years.</p> <p>You won't find this in their official histories, but the regional arts boards were created in the dog days of the Thatcher cultural revolution to make it as difficult as possible for undeserving arty types to get their hands on taxpayers' money.</p> <p>That is not exactly what the Wilding report, which set them up, intended, but that was certainly the subtext sold to the shires. It was the familiar story of Tory quangos. Public money was no longer to be handed over to special interests with their \"own agendas\", but would instead be wisely managed by 11 regional committees of right-thinking business people and down-to-earth aldermen, with the odd house-trained artistic type thrown in for colour.</p> <p>Before them would come a procession of prostrate petitioners, who would be given another spoonful of gruel on condition they mend their spendthrift ways. Pushing boundaries was all very well, but where were the business plans, marketing initiatives, administrative structures?</p> <p>There was money aplenty for tiny theatre and dance companies to develop management structures but little for them to stage anything. Eventually, new Byzantine schemes were devised to correct this minor defect, only for the rules to change the following year.

      "bodyText": "Where were you on March 15, that black day for local democracy when the regional arts boards were cruelly done to death? Huddled disbelieving in the rain numbed by the same sense of shock you last felt the day Diana died, laying wreaths outside your local RAB office, or leading a protest prayer meeting outside the Arts Council headquarters in Great Peter Street? Surely you were moved enough to write to your MP to rail at how New Labour was once again preaching devolution and practicing centralisation? Had not another of Tony's business cronies - in this case that \"jumped up caterer\" Gerry Robinson, the Granada chairman whose name sends a chill through every Little Chef in the land - been let loose with an axe on our cherished public services? Or, like all but a handful of the population, you might simply have wondered what on earth regional arts boards were, and what were they for. Indeed, that last question has been never far from the mind of anyone who has had anything to do with them over the past 11 years. You won't find this in their official histories, but the regional arts boards were created in the dog days of the Thatcher cultural revolution to make it as difficult as possible for undeserving arty types to get their hands on taxpayers' money. That is not exactly what the Wilding report, which set them up, intended, but that was certainly the subtext sold to the shires. It was the familiar story of Tory quangos. Public money was no longer to be handed over to special interests with their \"own agendas\", but would instead be wisely managed by 11 regional committees of right-thinking business people and down-to-earth aldermen, with the odd house-trained artistic type thrown in for colour. Before them would come a procession of prostrate petitioners, who would be given another spoonful of gruel on condition they mend their spendthrift ways. Pushing boundaries was all very well, but where were the business plans, marketing initiatives, administrative structures? There was money aplenty for tiny theatre and dance companies to develop management structures but little for them to stage anything. Eventually, new Byzantine schemes were devised to correct this minor defect, only for the rules to change the following year. To further complicate matters, the Arts Council would occasionally stick its oar in and demand a \"shift of emphasis\", or a few extra tick boxes to placate the latest minister for fun. This merry-go-round got so surreal that one regional board spent a third of its budget on administration. Form-filling became the great unacknowledged British art form of the 1990s. Such a constipated bureaucracy meant endlessly delayed decisions on funding, further undermining whatever shaky confidence artists had in the ability of RAB officers to judge work. Put brutally, many feel they are not up to their jobs. Those companies who could most successfully parrot whatever inane party line was current that month seemed to get the most cash.

Bono, whose real name is Paul Hewson, a singer who cut short his own post-secondary education in Dublin during the late 1970s in order to form his hugely successful group, has accepted an invitation to deliver a keynote speech to Harvard seniors at their class day ceremony on June 6. \"We're psyched,\" said Xunhua Wong, one of the student organisers of the festivities for the graduating Class of \"U2001\". Bono emerged as the guest of choice for the 1,600-plus Harvard seniors after they were polled earlier in the year to determine their preferences from a list that included the names of civic leaders, media personalities and political figures. Past speakers at the university's class day ceremonies have included Coretta Scott King, widow of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, Mother Teresa, and music producer Quincy Jones. The U2 frontman won out over the others because, notwithstanding his advancing years, he remains \"the epitome of cool\", according to a press release marking the announcement. \"Everybody here has grown up with U2 - they're a cross-generational kind of band,\" said Ms Wong, speaking by telephone from Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"I mean, like, all our conscious life, they've been there for everybody. You can't think of a time when U2 weren't there.\" At the same time, she said, the group's high-profile support for activist groups such as Greenpeace also tipped the choice in Bono's direction. Jeffrey D Sachs, a professor of economics and well-known social commentator at the university, who perhaps can still remember the world as it was before the emergence of the band, was asked to extend the formal invitation for the 41-year-old performer to appear at the venerable campus. The two men have worked together in the recent past, publicising the issue of debt relief for the world's poorest nations, a theme Dr Sachs expected Bono to return to during his Harvard address. Although Dr Sachs will probably share the university stage with Bono, it remained unclear whether the gesture will be reciprocated during the same week, when U2 plays four concerts at the nearby FleetCenter in Boston, where the group kicks off its keenly anticipated Elevation US Tour. Unfortunately for any fans who have missed out on tickets for the group's already sold-out shows in Boston, Bono's Ivy League performance also promises to be a closed shop, with entrance being restricted to university seniors and members of their immediate families.",

      "body": "<p>When Motorola ignored ministerial pleas and announced the closure of its Bathgate plant last month the government expressed disappointment and politely asked for its regional development aid back. In France when Marks &amp; Spencer and food group Danone announced closures and mass lay-offs, workers took to the streets and the government reached for the statute book. </p> <p>The reaction from the government and workers speaks volumes about France's very French approach to capitalism. True, the news from M&amp;S and Danone was followed by a warning from Dim, the underwear maker, that \"major restructuring\" is on the way; Moulinex, the household appliance manufacturer, has decided to scrap 1,500 jobs in France; Alcatel, the electronics firm, is to sell one of its French mobile phone plants; and 2,700 staff at two domestic airlines have been told their jobs will go by June. </p> <p>The global economic about-turns and shifting consumer behaviour patterns that explain this rash of large-scale redundancies matter little in France. What counts is the corporate response - and except in cases of dire, bankruptcy-looming necessity, selling off, shutting down, cutting back or pulling out are just not acceptable courses of action. </p> <p>That is why Marks &amp; Spencer's decision was described as \"brutal\", \"unacceptable\", \"inhumane\" and \"scandalous\", not just by furious French trade unions but by an equally furious Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, in what looked at first suspiciously like a bout of Brit-bashing. </p> <p>In a front-page rant, Le Monde Diplomatique asked whether one could expect any better of a country that had for more than 20 years been \"a laboratory for ultra-liberal market economics\" where \"perverted minds\" had favoured profit over sensible state regulation. </p> <p><strong> Overwhelming revulsion</strong><br> </p> <p> A fierce Gallic rejection of what are known here as \"Anglo-Saxon business practices\" in part explains the superstar status accorded to figures like Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, the pipe-smoking peasant activist who won fame by trashing a McDonald's restaurant. </p> <p>Now that native French companies are up to the the same sort of thing, it is clear there is more to it. Danone's plan, inspired not by present financial woes but by a desire to shore up future profits, was described as \"completely unjustifiable\" by 85% of respondents in a recent survey. </p> <p>So why such overwhelming revulsion at a straightforward, if tough, business decision? One answer is that France, which despite the influence of an omnipresent state has always been reluctant to place too much power in any one person's hands, never had its equivalent of the Thatcher revolution with its diet of deregulation and privatisation. </p> <p>In France the great mass of public opinion believes companies have a real social responsibility. \"Stock-market layoffs\", designed to please shareholders, are unacceptable, and employees, as a trade unionist said, \"cannot be treated like pawns to be sacrificed on a chess board\". </p> <p>What the French do want and expect from their employers is a virtue they have, paradoxically, imported from the English: le fairplay. Most also believe it is up to the government to ensure businesses do play fair. </p> <p>According to St\u00e9phane Roz\u00e8s of the CSA polling organisation, in a period of economic growth \"the very idea of redundancies is insupportable. People are not stupid - when times were bad, they were content to ask the government to limit the damage. Now they demand regulation.\" </p> <p>Regulation is what they got. Seizing on the perfect opportunity to make up lost ground after a poor showing in last month's local elections, Mr Jospin's government announced a package of measures to deter companies from mass firings. </p> <p>These included doubling the minimum redundancy pay, forcing companies to offer staff six months of retraining to help them to find other work, and fining those that fail to help develop replacement activities on sites they shut down. Employees are also to be given more say in restructuring plans, and allowed to hire management consultants to come up with alternatives. </p> <p>It was a revival of the kind of orthodox French statist intervention that seems a million miles from Tony Blair's response to Motorola's Bathgate closure. In traditionally dirigiste France it plays well, and for some it did not go far enough. Mr Jospin's Communist coalition partners demanded that all layoffs by profit-making companies be made illegal. </p> <p>France's highly regulated labour market and the hefty social costs of employing workers may be decried by the 200,000 or so French people who have moved to London in recent years to find work, and by the hundreds of young French entrepreneurs who have set up shop in Britain or America where job laws are more flexible, meaning it is easier and cheaper to hire and fire. </p> <p>They do not, at the moment, appear to be doing a great deal of harm to France's economy, which is faring just as well as Britain's and, according to the International Monetary Fund, will grow at 2.6% this year and next - leaving a slowing US economy in its slipstream. </p> <p>Last year the French economy generated 500,000 new jobs. This year, accord ing to St\u00e9phane D\u00e9o at investment bank UBS Warburg in Paris the total is likely to be 300,000. </p> <p>Then there is the 35-hour week. The Jospin administration's job-creating brainchild was greeted with hoots of derision when it was announced in 1997. It is now in place for companies employing more than 20 people, and to the surprise of many observers has won over most of its opponents. </p> <p><strong> Underlying reality</strong><br> </p> <p> Surveys have shown 80% of the 5m French men and women benefiting from three or four weeks' extra holiday a year felt the shift to 35 hours had been \"positive or very positive\" for them personally. </p> <p>Of company directors, 60% believe the law has helped to increase productivity through renewed dialogue with the workforce, reforms to outdated and inflexible working practices, and increased morale. </p> <p>Proof that the Anglo-Saxon camp is wrong? Not quite. The underlying reality is that France has introduced a number of significant economic reforms. Large sections of the economy have been privatised. </p> <p>Little of the banking industry remains in the state sector. Much of the defence industry has been privatised and merged with German and Spanish partners. National symbols such as France T\u00e9l\u00e9com and Air France have been sold to investors. </p> <p>Jospin's Socialist government has been no less willing than some of its rightwing predecessors to roll back the frontiers of the state. Despite France's reputation for strikes, the economy has benefited from wage restraint for much of the 1990s. Many of France's leading companies, like the vast new media conglomerate Vivendi which owns Universal studios, are lean, mean business machines very much on the Anglo-Saxon model. </p> <p>For all the changes France has not embraced the the symbol of the liberal market; shareholder value. The country clings to the notion that employers owe rather more to their employees than the equivalent of a P45 in exchange for a few pence on the share price.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Motorola ignored ministerial pleas and announced the closure of its Bathgate plant last month the government expressed disappointment and politely asked for its regional development aid back. In France when Marks &amp; Spencer and food group Danone announced closures and mass lay-offs, workers took to the streets and the government reached for the statute book. The reaction from the government and workers speaks volumes about France's very French approach to capitalism. True, the news from M&amp;S and Danone was followed by a warning from Dim, the underwear maker, that \"major restructuring\" is on the way; Moulinex, the household appliance manufacturer, has decided to scrap 1,500 jobs in France; Alcatel, the electronics firm, is to sell one of its French mobile phone plants; and 2,700 staff at two domestic airlines have been told their jobs will go by June. The global economic about-turns and shifting consumer behaviour patterns that explain this rash of large-scale redundancies matter little in France. What counts is the corporate response - and except in cases of dire, bankruptcy-looming necessity, selling off, shutting down, cutting back or pulling out are just not acceptable courses of action. That is why Marks &amp; Spencer's decision was described as \"brutal\", \"unacceptable\", \"inhumane\" and \"scandalous\", not just by furious French trade unions but by an equally furious Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, in what looked at first suspiciously like a bout of Brit-bashing. In a front-page rant, Le Monde Diplomatique asked whether one could expect any better of a country that had for more than 20 years been \"a laboratory for ultra-liberal market economics\" where \"perverted minds\" had favoured profit over sensible state regulation. Overwhelming revulsion A fierce Gallic rejection of what are known here as \"Anglo-Saxon business practices\" in part explains the superstar status accorded to figures like Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, the pipe-smoking peasant activist who won fame by trashing a McDonald's restaurant. Now that native French companies are up to the the same sort of thing, it is clear there is more to it. Danone's plan, inspired not by present financial woes but by a desire to shore up future profits, was described as \"completely unjustifiable\" by 85% of respondents in a recent survey. So why such overwhelming revulsion at a straightforward, if tough, business decision? One answer is that France, which despite the influence of an omnipresent state has always been reluctant to place too much power in any one person's hands, never had its equivalent of the Thatcher revolution with its diet of deregulation and privatisation. In France the great mass of public opinion believes companies have a real social responsibility. \"Stock-market layoffs\", designed to please shareholders, are unacceptable, and employees, as a trade unionist said, \"cannot be treated like pawns to be sacrificed on a chess board\". What the French do want and expect from their employers is a virtue they have, paradoxically, imported from the English: le fairplay. Most also believe it is up to the government to ensure businesses do play fair. According to St\u00e9phane Roz\u00e8s of the CSA polling organisation, in a period of economic growth \"the very idea of redundancies is insupportable. People are not stupid - when times were bad, they were content to ask the government to limit the damage. Now they demand regulation.\" Regulation is what they got. Seizing on the perfect opportunity to make up lost ground after a poor showing in last month's local elections, Mr Jospin's government announced a package of measures to deter companies from mass firings. These included doubling the minimum redundancy pay, forcing companies to offer staff six months of retraining to help them to find other work, and fining those that fail to help develop replacement activities on sites they shut down. Employees are also to be given more say in restructuring plans, and allowed to hire management consultants to come up with alternatives. It was a revival of the kind of orthodox French statist intervention that seems a million miles from Tony Blair's response to Motorola's Bathgate closure. In traditionally dirigiste France it plays well, and for some it did not go far enough. Mr Jospin's Communist coalition partners demanded that all layoffs by profit-making companies be made illegal. France's highly regulated labour market and the hefty social costs of employing workers may be decried by the 200,000 or so French people who have moved to London in recent years to find work, and by the hundreds of young French entrepreneurs who have set up shop in Britain or America where job laws are more flexible, meaning it is easier and cheaper to hire and fire. They do not, at the moment, appear to be doing a great deal of harm to France's economy, which is faring just as well as Britain's and, according to the International Monetary Fund, will grow at 2.6% this year and next - leaving a slowing US economy in its slipstream. Last year the French economy generated 500,000 new jobs. This year, accord ing to St\u00e9phane D\u00e9o at investment bank UBS Warburg in Paris the total is likely to be 300,000. Then there is the 35-hour week. The Jospin administration's job-creating brainchild was greeted with hoots of derision when it was announced in 1997. It is now in place for companies employing more than 20 people, and to the surprise of many observers has won over most of its opponents. Underlying reality Surveys have shown 80% of the 5m French men and women benefiting from three or four weeks' extra holiday a year felt the shift to 35 hours had been \"positive or very positive\" for them personally. Of company directors, 60% believe the law has helped to increase productivity through renewed dialogue with the workforce, reforms to outdated and inflexible working practices, and increased morale. Proof that the Anglo-Saxon camp is wrong? Not quite. The underlying reality is that France has introduced a number of significant economic reforms. Large sections of the economy have been privatised. Little of the banking industry remains in the state sector. Much of the defence industry has been privatised and merged with German and Spanish partners. National symbols such as France T\u00e9l\u00e9com and Air France have been sold to investors. Jospin's Socialist government has been no less willing than some of its rightwing predecessors to roll back the frontiers of the state. Despite France's reputation for strikes, the economy has benefited from wage restraint for much of the 1990s. Many of France's leading companies, like the vast new media conglomerate Vivendi which owns Universal studios, are lean, mean business machines very much on the Anglo-Saxon model. For all the changes France has not embraced the the symbol of the liberal market; shareholder value. The country clings to the notion that employers owe rather more to their employees than the equivalent of a P45 in exchange for a few pence on the share price.",

Only twice in April was it possible to view the plays in strict chronological sequence. Contrast that with 1964, when Peter Hall staged a similar cycle at Stratford. Admittedly, the Henry VI trilogy was condensed into two plays under the generic title of The Wars of the Roses. But the seven-play cycle, from Richard II to Richard III, was performed countless times through a Stratford summer. What was then a popular success has become a collector's item. </p> <p>But mention of 1964 shows how the histories constantly shift their meaning. Two key influences dominated Hall's version: Bertolt Brecht and the pioneering Polish critic Jan Kott.

But the effect is surprisingly different. Hall and his co-directors gave the plays a deliberate continuity, as if we were watching the enactment of a curse. Today the plays are called This England, and the sense is of fragmentation, as if to mirror our current national divisions. Four directors tackle the eight plays in radically diverse styles, and they are staged in a range of venues, from the Barbican to the Young Vic. And England is symbolised in differing ways: a mound of earth, the flag of Saint George and jingoistic hymns in Steven Pimlott's Richard II; a curving wall of steel in Michael Boyd's Henry VI trilogy.

Does he have anything to say in a hi-tech, multicultural, globally capitalist world? When you see the plays performed, the questions become literally academic. In particular, the so-called \"history cycle\" is grossly misnamed. In reality, it is an eight-play political cycle that constantly returns to key issues of the corrupting isolation of power, the difficulty of combining justice and liberty, and the danger of division spreading through a factionalised land.

But, shortly after reading last week of the internal plotting against the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, I found myself watching a precise replication of the process on stage in Henry VI Part Two. It is exactly the means by which the English nobles get rid of the all-powerful Lord Protector. </p> <p>You'd be hard-pressed to find any country where the plays' analysis of power, justice and the fragile tension between order and chaos is not immediately relevant. But there is a danger in always justifying Shakespeare by his prophetic insight into current events, as if he were some kind of theatrical Nostradamus. Followed closely by Schiller, he was the best of political dramatists because he understood the mechanism of power. What I also took away from the RSC cycle was a heightened awareness of Shakespeare's moral ambivalence: his uncanny ability to see both private character and public events from every perspective. </p> <p>Shakespeare's private obsessions also emerge when you see the plays in bulk. People often say we know little of Shakespeare. I'm always astonished at how much we do actually learn about him from the plays. On a trivial level, I've never noticed anyone comment on his fixation on body odour and halitosis. More seriously, sequential exposure to the histories reveals a preoccupation with fathers and sons.

But they are in fact remarkably open to the world; they emit a lot more telecoms traffic than they receive. Contrast those Islamic countries with Pakistan, where incoming calls hugely outnumber messages out.</p> <p>The chart shows some of the imbalances in international telecoms. They have to do with diaspora. Poland, Egypt and Vietnam are \"deficit\" countries in the telecoms stakes probably because large numbers of people emigrated from those countries but call home a lot. These figures are surely an indicator of globalisation. It is often painted as an anonymous process, to do with capital flows, but is also about intensely personal contact. Add to telephony remittances sent home and tourists and the picture starts to round out. It is not necessarily more positive but it is certainly more human.</p> <p>Globalisation has been much blamed but little measured, the latter perhaps explaining the former. What you cannot put dimensions to is easy to fear as an unstoppable juggernaut. When you put numbers in it immediately looks less oppressive and - this is the gist of a recent essay in <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Foreign Policy</a> - may even diminish. The magazine recently broke new ground by publishing an index of globalisation. It claims the rate at which globalisation has been growing has started to fall in recent years.</p> <p>A word of caution, especially for those who equate globalisation with American cultural imperialism. Foreign Policy is published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which is a not-for-profit foundation with good internationalist credentials. But the index has been compiled in collaboration with AT Kearney (a global consultant) which is owned by EDS. This is the company that bid to run UK air traffic control and, at some considerable cost, supplies IT services to the UK government. It is a company with a vested interest in... globalisation.</p> <p>Which of course needs to be measured in terms of the flow of goods, services and capital. Obvious indicators include investment, capital flows and foreign income as a proportion of national income and convergence between domestic and international prices. Information technology is a proxy for \"openness\" so the population online and the number of internet hosts or secure servers per capita become significant. Foreign Policy's list is not exhaustive or unexceptionable. The point is, not all the indicators move in the same direction or at anything like the same speed. And the American way is not, it turns out, the global way.</p> <p>The winner of the \"most globalised\" country prize goes to Singapore. Anti-capitalist protests would not be welcome in Lee Kuan Yew's Asian paradise but they would have to respect how he managed to insulate the country while pursuing an aggressively open policy in trade and finance. And it is open. Singapore's outgoing telephone traffic is nearly 390 minutes per year per head, four times as much as from the US.</p> <p>In a different way, the countries ranked second to eighth on Foreign Policy's list of most globalised show that cultural differences or indeed versions of socialism need not be casualties of economic liberalism. For top dogs after Singapore are the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, the Irish Republic and Austria. With the exception of the Republic of Ireland, they are notoriously collectivist. The Dutch and Swedes seem to have found a way to combine trade, technological advance and tourism with high tax and public spending. Dutch foreign investment is worth 19% of GDP. Some 44% of Swedish households are online, while Finland and Norway have more than 70 web-connected servers (internet hosts) per 1,000 people.</p> <p>And generous welfare benefits. Someone should tell Tony Blair and Gordon Brown that they too can have free trade and investment and social security. Foreign Policy comments \"the fact that Sweden, Finland and the rest of Scandinavia have been able to nurture fast moving technological developments with lumbering regulatory and tax regimes offers an unexpected contradiction\". But only to Americans and Mr Blair's advisers.</p> <p>The UK comes next in the list followed by - Scandinavians again - Norway and Denmark. Then the US, not as open as all that. Proportionately, the US receives one sixth of Singapore's tourists and travellers. And Swiss citizens spend 400% more time on international phone calls than Americans. The US \"posted relatively low scores in measures of economic integration and personal contact with the rest of the world\" - which may be one reason for George Bush and national missile defence (Read the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/leaders/story/0,3604,481609,00.html\">leader</a>).</p> <p>Israel and Malaysia feature in the top 20, signalling once again that globalisation tells you very little about domestic policy.

      "bodyText": "You would not normally call Saudi Arabia or even the United Arab Emirates \"global\" countries, especially in the boo-word sense used by yesterday's protesters. But they are in fact remarkably open to the world; they emit a lot more telecoms traffic than they receive. Contrast those Islamic countries with Pakistan, where incoming calls hugely outnumber messages out. The chart shows some of the imbalances in international telecoms. They have to do with diaspora. Poland, Egypt and Vietnam are \"deficit\" countries in the telecoms stakes probably because large numbers of people emigrated from those countries but call home a lot. These figures are surely an indicator of globalisation. It is often painted as an anonymous process, to do with capital flows, but is also about intensely personal contact. Add to telephony remittances sent home and tourists and the picture starts to round out. It is not necessarily more positive but it is certainly more human. Globalisation has been much blamed but little measured, the latter perhaps explaining the former. What you cannot put dimensions to is easy to fear as an unstoppable juggernaut. When you put numbers in it immediately looks less oppressive and - this is the gist of a recent essay in Foreign Policy - may even diminish. The magazine recently broke new ground by publishing an index of globalisation. It claims the rate at which globalisation has been growing has started to fall in recent years. A word of caution, especially for those who equate globalisation with American cultural imperialism. Foreign Policy is published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, which is a not-for-profit foundation with good internationalist credentials. But the index has been compiled in collaboration with AT Kearney (a global consultant) which is owned by EDS. This is the company that bid to run UK air traffic control and, at some considerable cost, supplies IT services to the UK government. It is a company with a vested interest in... globalisation. Which of course needs to be measured in terms of the flow of goods, services and capital. Obvious indicators include investment, capital flows and foreign income as a proportion of national income and convergence between domestic and international prices. Information technology is a proxy for \"openness\" so the population online and the number of internet hosts or secure servers per capita become significant. Foreign Policy's list is not exhaustive or unexceptionable. The point is, not all the indicators move in the same direction or at anything like the same speed. And the American way is not, it turns out, the global way. The winner of the \"most globalised\" country prize goes to Singapore. Anti-capitalist protests would not be welcome in Lee Kuan Yew's Asian paradise but they would have to respect how he managed to insulate the country while pursuing an aggressively open policy in trade and finance. And it is open. Singapore's outgoing telephone traffic is nearly 390 minutes per year per head, four times as much as from the US. In a different way, the countries ranked second to eighth on Foreign Policy's list of most globalised show that cultural differences or indeed versions of socialism need not be casualties of economic liberalism. For top dogs after Singapore are the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, the Irish Republic and Austria. With the exception of the Republic of Ireland, they are notoriously collectivist. The Dutch and Swedes seem to have found a way to combine trade, technological advance and tourism with high tax and public spending. Dutch foreign investment is worth 19% of GDP. Some 44% of Swedish households are online, while Finland and Norway have more than 70 web-connected servers (internet hosts) per 1,000 people. And generous welfare benefits. Someone should tell Tony Blair and Gordon Brown that they too can have free trade and investment and social security. Foreign Policy comments \"the fact that Sweden, Finland and the rest of Scandinavia have been able to nurture fast moving technological developments with lumbering regulatory and tax regimes offers an unexpected contradiction\". But only to Americans and Mr Blair's advisers. The UK comes next in the list followed by - Scandinavians again - Norway and Denmark. Then the US, not as open as all that. Proportionately, the US receives one sixth of Singapore's tourists and travellers. And Swiss citizens spend 400% more time on international phone calls than Americans. The US \"posted relatively low scores in measures of economic integration and personal contact with the rest of the world\" - which may be one reason for George Bush and national missile defence (Read the leader). Israel and Malaysia feature in the top 20, signalling once again that globalisation tells you very little about domestic policy. There is no Fukuyama-esque logic here. Meanwhile many countries remain \"stalled at much lower levels of integration with little indication of change\". Coca-colonisation, as it used to be called, does not have much effect on underlying values and the arrival of McDonald's does not rule out progressive taxation. On this index moreover globalisation is positively correlated with fairness. The most open countries have more equitable income distribution and score well on measures of honesty in public and commercial affairs and political pluralism. david.walker@theguardian.com The London May Day protests at a glance Minute-by-minute coverage of the demonstrations Audio reports John Vidal witnesses a party atmosphere outside McDonald's in King's Cross, London (1min 45) Sarah Left on the Critical Mass cycle ride (2mins) Caption competition Send us a caption for this May Day picture and win a prize Related articles 01.05.2001: May Day could cost millions 01.05.2001: Police maintain iron grip on capital 01.05.2001: May Day mood begins to darken 01.05.2001, comment: Politics not parliament 01.05.2001: Blair attacks 'spurious' May Day protest 01.05.2001: Confusion reigns as police brace for mayhem 01.05.2001, comment: Violence is our enemy Photo galleries Pictures of today's protests in London Pictures of today's protests around the world Interactive guide Interactive guide to global protests Maps What's happened so far What's going on in Oxford Street How the Guardian is covering May Day 01.05.2001: Keeping a level head Weblog special May Day 2001 The issue explained History of anti-capitalism protests The May Day protests Talk about it What do you think?

She said a scientist advising both sides had a conflict of interest and hit out at the insurers Norwich Union for using a genetic test for susceptibility to breast cancer which had never been approved for insurance purposes. Lady Kennedy is chairwoman of the human genetics commission, which yesterday called for a three year moratorium on the use of genetic tests by insurance companies, saying the existing system had failed. The Association of British Insurers responded with a voluntary two year ban on genetic tests being factored into insurance policies worth up to \u00a3300,000. Lady Kennedy welcomed the insurance companies' move, but said it had taken too long. She added: \"We have pro found misgivings about the industry's handling of this information and its ability to keep its own house in order.\" The HGC is furious that the insurance industry has not played by the rules it helped set up in the mid-1990s, when it agreed to the setting up of an advisory body, the Genetics and Insurance Committee, which would review genetic tests for susceptibility to disease and judge on whether they were scientifically reliable enough for insurance purposes. Lady Kennedy said it had been understood that the insurance industry would only use genetic tests which the GAIC had approved. Instead, insurers decided that they would use genetic tests until the GAIC told them not to. She singled out the Norwich Union for demanding that insurance applicants disclose results of genetic tests for genes which predispose them to breast cancer, even though the GAIC had never ruled on whether this was acceptable. \"Here you have one of the major players breaking the industry's self-imposed code of practice. This is one of the things that quite outraged the commission,\" she said.

But while some single genes are accurate predictors of future illness, most are mere indicators of an increased risk of disease. There is fear that a valuable diagnostic tool, and genetics research in general, could be threatened if insurers are too eager to demand disclosure of the results of tests.

It gives tips from other contract researchers indicating what you should think about before deciding to do contract research, how to get the most out of it and how to avoid some of the problems caused by the nature of contract research. </p> <p>Of course, no guide will ever be a substitute for getting detailed personal advice on your particular situation from your union - the CRS experience varies enormously, even within the same department, and it is therefore impossible to cover all circumstances.</p> <p>However, it is important to emphasise that, despite all of these problems, academic research is often extremely rewarding. It is a great opportunity to pursue something which you are passionately interested in, and offers flexibility, supportive colleagues in a stimulating environment, and the chance to make world-shattering discoveries, at the cutting edge of knowledge.</p> <p>On the other hand, the very use of fixed-term contracts is often the cause of many of the difficulties highlighted below. Higher education unions argue that they are also extremely inefficient and do not enable institutions and researchers to pursue their work in the most productive way. The Association of University Teachers (AUT) is campaigning against the casualisation of academic staff and for the vast majority to be employed on a long-term basis. </p> <p>You may agree with this (and wish to participate in union campaigns against casualisation), but here we will only look at getting the most out of the current situation, one where almost all researchers in universities are employed on fixed-term contracts. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"B\">Doing your own research</a></strong><br> There are a lot of advantages to being a member of CRS. Hours are generally more flexible than in many jobs (but you need to check) and, in the right research group, you can enjoy your work. You may also be somewhat more protected in terms of the teaching and administration that you can be required to undertake, but you will need to find out what your position would actually be. </p> <p>Find out what being CRS really involves and understand what you would be getting into. Make use of national CRS networks or look at research into CRS issues, for example Colin Bryson's research. Do you actually want to do it? Does it fit in with your career plans? One reason CRS run into trouble is because they are not clear about what they may be expected to do. </p> <p><strong>The research environment:</strong> If you decide CRS is for you, then go and meet the people that you would be working with, or who are in the same unit or department. Is it friendly and does it provide a good working atmosphere, or is it likely that you will be working in a small room isolated from everyone else? Will you have your own office or laboratory space? Will appropriate equipment be available and supported, or will you end up as the lab technician?.</p> <p><strong>The institution:</strong> This is a bit wider than the immediate research group but just as important. After all, the institution is your employer. </p> <p>Not all institutions treat CRS in the same way. Find out if your institution has a code of practice for employing CRS. This should cover project management, maternity leave and pay (check carefully any qualification conditions), and provision for support at the end of a project, including bridging and redundancy. Will you get redundancy pay and does the institution operate a meaningful redeployment scheme? Do CRS have parity with established lecturing staff with respect to their terms and conditions? Will you be treated as a member of staff (as you should be), or essentially as a student? Do you have equal access to the library? Are relocation expenses paid? Will the institution charge you fees if you wish to take a further degree?</p> <p>Then check if the code is actually implemented. The two important principles are that it is the university that is your employer (not the research funder or your project manager) and that you are a full member of staff (rather than a glorified student).</p> <p><strong>The research funder:</strong> Contract research is paid for from a variety of sources, including the government-funded research councils, various charities, the European Union and commercial enterprises.</p> <p>All have their own interests and requirements. You should check what the particular rules attached to your funding would be, and whether they will restrict you. For example, will you be able to spend a proportion of your time on work not directly related to the project (training, teaching, your own research)? Are there any restrictions on publication or ownership of the work? Is the funder committed for the full duration of the project or is there a possibility they will stop the funding, perhaps because they are not satisfied with interim results? Does the funder allow CRS to apply for research grants in their own name? </p> <p>As part of their mission, the main research councils are required to provide trained researchers. As well as funding postgraduate students, some interpret this as requiring a continuous flow of CRS, and so their policies are designed to discourage CRS from staying in universities for more than a couple of contracts.</p> <p>By arming yourself with this information before you begin, you will go a long way to saving yourself from some nasty surprises or disappointments later on. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"C\">Joining a union</a></strong><br> Fixed-term contracts themselves are the cause of many of the problems described here. Contract researchers are more vulnerable than any other staff group to being unfairly treated or dismissed, and missing out on legal entitlements. You may find it difficult to stand up for yourself unless you know that your situation is wrong and that there are people to support you. Reliable information and advice may not be available. You will not have a very loud voice on your own. </p> <p>It is therefore essential that you join a union. You may not want to get actively involved, but think of it as insurance. Only a union can help effectively if anything bad happens to you, but like any insurance it can only help if you have been a member for some time prior to a crisis.</p> <p>You may see your current job as a short-term thing that will end soon anyway. But there may be problems within your first contract. This may well be extended, sometimes several times, so unless you join at the start there is a danger you will be without insurance for a long time. </p> <p>Also, only the unions can have any hope of influencing your pay and conditions, and then only if they're seen to represent enough CRS.</p> <p>You may also wish to become active in the union in order to fight against casualisation and the second-class academic citizenship of CRS. </p> <p>The AUT has a CRS committee which initiates and coordinates campaigns, responds to national developments and liaises between CRS members and the national AUT. The National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education (NATFHE) represents academic staff (more in post-1992 universities) and is also committed to reducing casualisation. The Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union (MSF) opposes short-term contracts among scientific workers and promotes greater participation by women in science, engineering and technology.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"D\">Understanding your position</a></strong><br> Before accepting a job you should find out specifically what will be expected of you.</p> <p>Will you be required to undertake any teaching, supervision or administration? Again, if you know about this beforehand, you can take appropriate action if you are not happy.</p> <p>Do not let managers offload inappropriate tasks onto you, such as arbitrary teaching or administrative duties. Any teaching should have been agreed with you at the start and, in general, should be related to your research. You are there to do research - and a little teaching if that's what you want - so do not get distracted.</p> <p>This is particularly true if your post is being funded by a research council or a commercial enterprise that has asked for a particular piece of work. Questions will be asked if the work is not completed, and you may get the blame, even if it's not your fault. </p> <p>However, check that you will have the opportunity for personal development via training, or have some proportion of your time to pursue your own non-project research. </p> <p>If you are sharing your time between more than one project, or if you are to be employed part-time, check that it is clear how much time you will be expected to allocate to a particular project. There is always the danger that the sum of the parts will be greater than the whole.</p> <p>It is also useful to see the proposal for the project that you are working on. This will probably lay down quite clearly what is expected of you.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"E\">Hours</a></strong><br> One of the perceived benefits of academic research is that you have very flexible hours and are free to work when you wish, as long as you get the job done. Many contracts do not specify hours, saying you will be expected to work \"reasonable hours\". </p> <p>However, you should check if there are times when you will be expected or required to work. For example, will you be required to work weekends? If there are required hours, you may be happy to accept them (if they are reasonable), but at least it will be far easier to walk away or to negotiate if you are not happy. It is one thing voluntarily working certain hours, but may well be a problem for you if you have to do it.</p> <p>Also check that your department's position on working from home fits in with your own wishes, working style and circumstances. Some departments forbid working from home, whereas other departments are happy for employees to work from home on a regular basis. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"F\">Authorship</a></strong><br> When you accept, but before the project starts, get a written agreement from your project team members about authorship of papers. Make sure you are clear about the circumstances under which someone will appear as an author, and about how the order of authors will be determined. That way, the principles are laid down and you know where you stand. </p> <p>Although different disciplines have their own conventions, in general, if you contribute directly (by writing) or indirectly (for example, by producing results) to a paper, then you should be included as an author.</p> <p>A related and particular thorny topic concerns the inclusion in the author list of one's manager or project supervisor, even if they have made little or no contribution. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"G\">Understanding your contract rights</a></strong><br> You should be issued with a written contract before you begin work.</p> <p>Read it carefully before you accept and make sure that you understand what it is saying. Seek advice from your union if you are not certain. If it refers to other documents, get hold of them and make sure you know what they say.</p> <p>\u0095 Duration: The contract should normally last as long as the project. Check that there are no probationary periods or other reviews that you did not expect. </p> <p>\u0095 Conditions: Check that these match what you have been told. It is not reasonable for the contract to introduce conditions you were not already aware of. Again, ask advice from your union if you are unsure before you sign. Equally, you should question anything that you think is missing - it is dangerous to rely on verbal agreements. </p> <p>\u0095 Watch your pay: Get hold of the local pay scales and descriptions of the grading levels. Check where you are on them and whether it is where you should be, given your age, role and qualifications. If the annual salary stated on your pay slip does not match any current scale point, you may have missed out on recent national pay rises. When offered a research post, always check that annual increments will be applied to move you up the pay scale step by step - this doesn't always happen. Also, try to find out what your colleagues are earning, especially if you are a woman or a member of an ethnic minority. You could be a victim of unjustified discrimination.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"H\">Employment rights</a></strong><br> Find out what your employment rights are so that you will be in a position to determine whether they are being honoured. </p> <p>They cover important things such as maternity, pension, sick leave, pay scales, redundancy or dismissal, holiday, hours, and disability rights. If you will be working part-time, ensure that you have the same (pro-rata) conditions as your full-time colleagues. </p> <p>The area is far too big to list in detail, but clearly, your union will be able to assist you. Your CRS colleagues will also be able to help, both within your institution and outside. However, it is always worth confirming any information because they may be misinformed. </p> <p>Equally, do not rely on what your manager or personnel officer tells you - always double check.</p> <p>It is best to resolve problems as soon as you start and to ensure that your contract makes all of the conditions of your employment clear. Verbal agreements and reassurances are not usually much use later on. </p> <p>Do not let your employer get away with things just because you do not know any different - be sure to complain if they try.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"I\"> Finance and pensions </a></strong><br> Some long-term CRS have put off getting a mortgage for many years due to job insecurity, fear of unemployment or the need to move to the other end of the country to get a job in their field. In fact, much of the academic system seems to assume that people can move around at will, often for the dubious benefit of getting a short contract somewhere else.</p> <p>However, due to family circumstances you may wish to settle in one area and commit to home ownership. In many cases your contract will be extended, and many mortgage lenders recognise this and are more prepared to offer a loan to CRS. You should ensure that you know when to leave well in advance of the end of your contract.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"J\">Joining a pension scheme</a></strong><br> Just as you may think it's not worth bothering joining a union because you are only on a short-term contract, you may also think that there's no point in joining a pension scheme. But, as before, this contract may be the first of many and, before you know it, you'll have missed out on many years of pensionable service.</p> <p>So join a pension scheme as soon as you start. The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) operates within pre-1992 universities and the Teachers* Pension Scheme (TPS) within post-1992 universities.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"K\">Isolation</a></strong><br> This is a common situation, especially for individual researchers. Even if you join a research team, you may end up with a very restricted view of your unit or institution as a whole. You may not really be considered a member of the department - for example, you may not be \"expected\" to attend departmental meetings - so you have to try hard to get involved. In many departments, you may find you are pushing at open doors, although sadly, in others you may still find yourself excluded from departmental meetings because of the nature of your contract.</p> <p>Find out what CRS forums operate in the institution. For instance, does the institution actively support networks of CRS representatives?</p> <p>Seek to broaden your horizons by, for example, developing an interest in Fixed-Term Contract Staff (FTCS) issues via your union or CRS networks, or serving on senate. This is obviously important if situations develop in your research environment which need changing. Here you can also seek the support of the FTCS mailing list, because part of the solution is often the knowledge that you are not alone.</p>",

This is particularly true if your post is being funded by a research council or a commercial enterprise that has asked for a particular piece of work. Questions will be asked if the work is not completed, and you may get the blame, even if it's not your fault. However, check that you will have the opportunity for personal development via training, or have some proportion of your time to pursue your own non-project research. If you are sharing your time between more than one project, or if you are to be employed part-time, check that it is clear how much time you will be expected to allocate to a particular project. There is always the danger that the sum of the parts will be greater than the whole. It is also useful to see the proposal for the project that you are working on. This will probably lay down quite clearly what is expected of you. Hours One of the perceived benefits of academic research is that you have very flexible hours and are free to work when you wish, as long as you get the job done. Many contracts do not specify hours, saying you will be expected to work \"reasonable hours\". However, you should check if there are times when you will be expected or required to work. For example, will you be required to work weekends? If there are required hours, you may be happy to accept them (if they are reasonable), but at least it will be far easier to walk away or to negotiate if you are not happy. It is one thing voluntarily working certain hours, but may well be a problem for you if you have to do it. Also check that your department's position on working from home fits in with your own wishes, working style and circumstances. Some departments forbid working from home, whereas other departments are happy for employees to work from home on a regular basis. Authorship When you accept, but before the project starts, get a written agreement from your project team members about authorship of papers. Make sure you are clear about the circumstances under which someone will appear as an author, and about how the order of authors will be determined. That way, the principles are laid down and you know where you stand. Although different disciplines have their own conventions, in general, if you contribute directly (by writing) or indirectly (for example, by producing results) to a paper, then you should be included as an author. A related and particular thorny topic concerns the inclusion in the author list of one's manager or project supervisor, even if they have made little or no contribution. Understanding your contract rights You should be issued with a written contract before you begin work. Read it carefully before you accept and make sure that you understand what it is saying. Seek advice from your union if you are not certain. If it refers to other documents, get hold of them and make sure you know what they say. \u0095 Duration: The contract should normally last as long as the project. Check that there are no probationary periods or other reviews that you did not expect. \u0095 Conditions: Check that these match what you have been told. It is not reasonable for the contract to introduce conditions you were not already aware of. Again, ask advice from your union if you are unsure before you sign. Equally, you should question anything that you think is missing - it is dangerous to rely on verbal agreements. \u0095 Watch your pay: Get hold of the local pay scales and descriptions of the grading levels. Check where you are on them and whether it is where you should be, given your age, role and qualifications. If the annual salary stated on your pay slip does not match any current scale point, you may have missed out on recent national pay rises. When offered a research post, always check that annual increments will be applied to move you up the pay scale step by step - this doesn't always happen. Also, try to find out what your colleagues are earning, especially if you are a woman or a member of an ethnic minority. You could be a victim of unjustified discrimination. Employment rights Find out what your employment rights are so that you will be in a position to determine whether they are being honoured. They cover important things such as maternity, pension, sick leave, pay scales, redundancy or dismissal, holiday, hours, and disability rights. If you will be working part-time, ensure that you have the same (pro-rata) conditions as your full-time colleagues. The area is far too big to list in detail, but clearly, your union will be able to assist you. Your CRS colleagues will also be able to help, both within your institution and outside. However, it is always worth confirming any information because they may be misinformed. Equally, do not rely on what your manager or personnel officer tells you - always double check. It is best to resolve problems as soon as you start and to ensure that your contract makes all of the conditions of your employment clear. Verbal agreements and reassurances are not usually much use later on. Do not let your employer get away with things just because you do not know any different - be sure to complain if they try. Finance and pensions Some long-term CRS have put off getting a mortgage for many years due to job insecurity, fear of unemployment or the need to move to the other end of the country to get a job in their field. In fact, much of the academic system seems to assume that people can move around at will, often for the dubious benefit of getting a short contract somewhere else. However, due to family circumstances you may wish to settle in one area and commit to home ownership. In many cases your contract will be extended, and many mortgage lenders recognise this and are more prepared to offer a loan to CRS. You should ensure that you know when to leave well in advance of the end of your contract. Joining a pension scheme Just as you may think it's not worth bothering joining a union because you are only on a short-term contract, you may also think that there's no point in joining a pension scheme. But, as before, this contract may be the first of many and, before you know it, you'll have missed out on many years of pensionable service. So join a pension scheme as soon as you start. The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) operates within pre-1992 universities and the Teachers* Pension Scheme (TPS) within post-1992 universities. Isolation This is a common situation, especially for individual researchers. Even if you join a research team, you may end up with a very restricted view of your unit or institution as a whole. You may not really be considered a member of the department - for example, you may not be \"expected\" to attend departmental meetings - so you have to try hard to get involved. In many departments, you may find you are pushing at open doors, although sadly, in others you may still find yourself excluded from departmental meetings because of the nature of your contract. Find out what CRS forums operate in the institution. For instance, does the institution actively support networks of CRS representatives? Seek to broaden your horizons by, for example, developing an interest in Fixed-Term Contract Staff (FTCS) issues via your union or CRS networks, or serving on senate. This is obviously important if situations develop in your research environment which need changing. Here you can also seek the support of the FTCS mailing list, because part of the solution is often the knowledge that you are not alone.",

Reaching 3-1 with consecutive breaks of 114 and 91 Doherty was flying but a frame-winning 72 started Higgins' four-frame streak to go two frames ahead at the close. Peter Ebdon, displaying no sign of mental fatigue from his 10hr 49min 13-12 win over Stephen Lee on Monday night, split his opening session with Ronnie O'Sullivan 4-4. Ebdon, excruciatingly slow at times against Lee, who felt that he was \"pushing the limit\" in that respect, was immediately into his higher gears yesterday morning, twice leading by the odd frame through runs of 69 and 101 before O'Sullivan levelled with one of 82 and then led 3-2.

      "bodyText": "The Racecourse Association has recommended the Go-Racing media rights contract to all courses. Keith Brown, the RCA chairman, said: \"We have thoroughly examined the contract and firmly believe that this is in the best long-term interests of the industry. \"We originally set about achieving a contract for all 59 racecourses and we are sorry that a few have fallen by the wayside. However, the remainder acting together provide a solid foundation as we move to the next stage of our strategy in partnership with the British Horseracing Board. \"The Go-Racing contract will help to keep horseracing as a mainstream British sport. It will encourage more people to follow the sport and attend race meetings.\" British-trained colts were in action in Rome yesterday for the Italian 2,000 Guineas with Cauvery faring best of the three challengers. The Sean Woods-trained colt was held up in mid-division by Frankie Dettori and made good headway in the final quarter of a mile to finish fourth behind Giovane Imperatore. Richard Hannon's Bram Stoker and the Mick Channon-trained Cd Europe were both unplaced in the Group Two contest. Clive Brittain's Zaheemah faded into fifth place under Dettori in the Prix Regina Elena (Italian 1,000 Guineas) after racing prominently from her outside draw. The Group Two contest was won by Bugia. Commanche Court has been installed 8-1 co-favourite by local bookmakers Paddy Power to repeat last year's vic tory in the \u00a3130,000 Powers Gold Label Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse on Sunday. Ted Walsh's eight-year-old heads the weights for the marathon on 12st with Micko's Dream, from the Willie Mullins' stable, next on 11st 10lb. Foxchapel King, who was runner-up last year and 8-1 co-favourite, has 10st 13lb. The Powers Irish Grand National is the highlight of the final day of the Easter Festival at Fairyhouse which has been delayed because of the foot and mouth disease precautions. On Saturday, the \u00a365,000 Powers Gold Cup and the \u00a380,000 Powers Gold Label Handicap Hurdle are the feature races. Sackville could be opposed by Limestone Lad in the Powers Gold Cup Novice Chase over two and a half miles, while Friday evening's session that opens the three-day meeting features three of Ireland's top jumpers in the Dan Moore Handicap Chase over an extended two miles. Mullins can chose between Florida Pearl (12st) and Micko's Dream who is rated 10lb inferior. Moscow Express, who defeated Florida Pearl last time, has risen sharply in the weights and is now just 3lb below the top weight. The Group Three Sagaro Stakes, over two miles, due to have been run at today's abandoned Ascot meeting, will now be included in the 2,000 Guineas programme at Newmarket on Saturday.

There he stands, every bit the proud paterfamilias, surrounded by the four children he is said to have cared for devotedly. Yet this same father, described by his wife's closest friend as \"one of the least aggressive men I knew\", coolly plotted to kill his entire family - cancelling the milk and his daughter's lift to school so that he would not be disturbed when bludgeoning them, one by one, to death.</p> <p>Of all violent crimes, those where the parent is the criminal are the most grimly baffling. How can parents turn on their children, hearing their cries, perhaps, and seeing their terrified faces, and murder them? The fact that it is so hard for most of us to get close to understanding gives an urgency to the question: how could a father like Robert Mochrie do it?</p> <p>We will never know the answer from Mochrie himself, a hotel owner from Haverfordwest in South Wales because, a Cardiff inquest was told last week, he hanged himself after murdering his wife, Cathy, along with Bethan, 10, Luke, 14, Sian, 16, and James, 18, in July last year. What we do know is that, although these homicide-suicides (as they are known) are rare enough to shock profoundly, this was not a freak case. According to Edinburgh-based forensic psychologist Dr Keith Ashcroft, whoseresearch has shown over years an average of around 0.2 per 100,000 of the population, \"It appears they are becoming more common.\"</p> <p>In recent years we have seen a series of disturbing paternal murders. Last month, Phillip Austin attacked his wife Claire with a mallet, threw her downstairs and stabbed her to death. He then collected their children from school, drugged them with sleeping pills and strangled them. In March last year, when Zainulabedin Zaidi arrived to pick up his children for an access visit, he slashed the neck of his ex-wife Shazia with a knife in front of their two children. Then, ignoring the screams of \"Don't kill me, Daddy\", he stabbed both to death. In both cases, the men were arrested and convicted, but most often, says Ashcroft, these fathers kill themselves afterwards.</p> <p>Such was the case with John Chetwynd, who in 1997 attacked his wife with a baseball bat before driving to Beachy Head, Sussex, where he jumped to his death, taking with him his three sons; and Justin Philpott, who, during a custody dispute in 1998, killed himself and his two young sons in a fume-filled car.</p> <p>Gerard Bailes, a psychologist with the East Anglia regional forensic service, describes the kind of murder it appears Mochrie committed. They are, he says, the result of a psychotic breakdown in which the father becomes disassociated from reality: \"He may be driven by delusions that make him think he is acting out of love, saving his children from intolerable or dangerous circumstances, or he may believe that his children are possessed. In this state, normal empathy has gone and the man is flooded with overwhelming feelings, hallucinations and compulsive drives. The father may indeed be able to look at the children he is killing but, because he is so cut off from feeling, what he sees has no meaning. It is not unusual for these men to plan their actions calmly and, indeed, during the planning stage, they may feel very calm. They are simply doing what must be done.\"</p> <p>Although such extreme behaviour often seems to erupt without warning, once a picture of the background is pieced together, there are often indications that the man has been struggling with stress, sleeping and eating badly and possibly drinking too much, so that his emotional thermostat is off kilter. Depression is a common symptom, too. Mochrie is described as having been stressed at work; he had serious financial problems and had suffered acute depression, which he kept secret from his family and treated with anti-depressants. He visited prostitutes regularly, and it emerged that his wife had been having an affair, all of which suggests there were serious domestic problems. At the inquest, psychiatrist Dr Brian Harris concluded that Mochrie had \"delusions of doom and disaster coming to his family and he was trying to protect them\".</p> <p>The more familiar type of paternal killing occurs when a relationship has broken down and the man feels he has been rejected by his wife and lost his children. Zaidi's wife, for example, had obtained a divorce and remarried a man who had taken on the children. In another instance, Kenneth McKay, whose partner had left him to escape a violent relationship, clearly intended to kill his six-year-old son and four-year-old daughter when he took them hostage at their home in Fleetwood, Lancashire, and slashed at their throats with a six-inch knife. When his son managed to push a key under the door and the police forced their way in, McKay cut his own throat in front of his children.</p> <p>'The overwhelming urge in these men is to hurt the mother as much as they can,\" argues Adam Jukes, a psychotherapist working with violent men and author of Why Men Hate Women (Free Association Books), \"They know that the cruellest thing they can do is to kill the children and leave her alive. It is the ultimate act of revenge. They are propelled by the same desire to control that frequently means these men have used intimidation and violence to control their partners in other circumstances.\"</p> <p>Vic Seidler, author of Man Enough (Sage), a sociological study of masculinity, takes a similar view. \"These men cannot bear the idea that another man may take their place in their children's lives, so they decide to kill them. The rationalisation is: 'It would be intolerable for them to live without me.' \" Although nothing, Seidler stresses, justifies what they do, we would do well to recognise how unequally men are still treated as regards children when relationships break down.</p> <p>\"At the same time, many of today's men no longer have the traditional role they once did, and they may have invested more in their children than generations of men before have,\" he continues. \"So the sense of loss is greater and there is a feeling of injustice - that they have done what they are told is right and been involved fathers but, when it comes to a split, that counts for nothing. They feel very distressed and angry.\"</p> <p>This is an argument that the campaigning group Families Need Fathers also advance: that women too often punish their former partners by doing all they can to prevent contact. Bradshaw, Stimson, Skinner and Williams, the authors of Absent Fathers? (Routledge), find similarly that men in regular contact with their children were likely to be calmer than those who did not: \"A major grievance was the difficulties fathers had seeing their children,\" they note.</p> <p>The tragedy is that these deaths might have been prevented if the men had gone for help and acknowledged their stresses and fears. One of the reasons men commit these murders more often than women, suggests Bailes, is that they feel \"it is not macho to admit that they can't cope\". Instead, he says, \"They insist even to themselves that nothing is wrong.\" So, tragically, it seems to have been with Robert Mochrie - a man whose neighbours declared \"was the last person on Earth you would expect to do anything like this\", and yet committed the most unimaginable of acts.</p>",

It allows all parents with children born after December 15 the chance to take up to 13 weeks' extra unpaid holiday.

On the face of it, the new law is a triumph for working parents, heralding a new era of family-friendly practices in the workplace. </p> <p>But there is a snag. While the extension of the EU directive might be a step in the right direction, parental leave is not all it is cracked up to be. Not only is it unpaid, but it must be taken in blocks of one week, is only available to workers who have been with their company for more than a year, and is conditional on employees giving their companies at least three weeks' notice. </p> <p>To cap it all, if the employer can prove that the granting of parental leave would be detrimental to their business, your leave can be postponed for up to six months. Not too handy if the childminder called in sick this morning. </p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry's senior policy adviser for employee relations, Graham Morton, agrees that there has been some confusion over what the new entitlement is for. \"There is a misunderstanding, as it is not meant for emergencies,\" he said. \"The kind of situation it might be used for is if care is provided informally by the extended family, who are going on holiday.\" The parents can then book additional time off from work to stay at home and look after their kids. But they would still be forced to take the leave in blocks of one week, each time losing that whole week's wages. Unless parents are able to negotiate a special deal with their employers, they could end up severely out of pocket - with no salary and a bill for the childminder's holiday pay. </p> <p>According to the GMB's head of equal rights, Karen Constantine, this explains why there has been a slow take-up of the scheme. Her union surveyed 200 members last year, and found that only one had taken advantage of the parental leave directive. \"Parents can't afford a period of time where they are unpaid,\" she says. \"If they are working a 60-hour week to make ends meet, how are they going to afford to take time off unpaid? </p> <p>\"The majority will end up robbing Peter to pay Paul. And it will be nigh on impossible for single-parent families to capitalise on the scheme.\" </p> <p>Full-time working mother Liz Easton says that she would relish the chance to spend more time at home with her two-year-old son Pip: \"I've been thinking about taking him to the clinic just to check up on his weight and height, but it's only open during working hours. I'd like to think that I could take some time off as a bonding time with Pip and not just use up holidays for emergencies. </p> <p>\"The 13 weeks would be useful if we had a real crisis, but I wouldn't really be able to afford it and would need to rely on my credit card.\" </p> <p>The only hope for parents forced to fritter away their annual vacation on the odd day here and there is to negotiate with their employers. Some companies have proved to be more sympathetic than others. Easton's previous employer, a large insurance company, could afford to be \"quite family-friendly\", offering 25 days' annual leave plus flexitime, which meant that Liz could leave work at 3.30pm or save up overtime to pay for extra days off. But working for a smaller company makes it difficult to take advantage of such rights. Fashion worker and mother of two Ann Hodge, who recently quit her part-time job, felt it was unlikely that her company would have been receptive to the idea of additional holidays on top of annual leave. </p> <p>\"Working for a small firm, they would have frowned upon it if I'd mentioned extra holidays,\" she says. \"If I had stuck to my guns and taken it, then it would have made relations in the office strained and life difficult.\" </p> <p>Terrence Libby, who employs 50 men and women at his manu-facturing company in Northamptonshire, explains why the parental leave directive is a strain on small business: \"There has already been an excessive extension of employees' rights over the last 18 months. Adding another 13 weeks is just another burden. </p> <p>\"Small companies do not have specialist departments: we may have just one person in the payroll department, for example, and if they are away, it is incredibly disruptive.\" </p> <p>But according to Margery Carey, president of retail workers' union USDAW, the onus is on employers first. \"The government has put the basic there - it's up to the employers to build on it,\" she argues. \"As a union we now have to put the meat on the bones and negotiate with companies. You don't get what you want overnight - we need to build on that.\" </p> <p>In the meantime, if your children are sent home from nursery tomorrow, there is another alternative to fibbing to the boss: time off for dependents was introduced alongside the parental leave directive and offers one or two days off for domestic emergencies. Sadly, it remains unpaid but, as notice is not required, it could go some way to bridge the gap until paid, flexible parental leave is finally introduced.</p>",

      "body": "<p>We may not care much for those who rule over us, but by and large, we let them go about their business in peace. The last time - some would say the only time - that we overthrew the system was in the 1640s. Trading-in Charles I for Oliver Cromwell was frankly quite stupid, so we've never done it again. One <a href=\"http://history.idbsu.edu/westciv/english/\" target=\"_NEW\"> Civil War</a> was quite enough, thank you.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.scotsmart.com/info/histfigures/princhas.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> Bonnie Prince Charlie</a> made a mild stab at revolution in 1745, but that was more to do with changing the management than changing the system. Since then, there have been plenty of radical attempts to change the order of things, but the outcome of most of them, like the wretched <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRcato.htm\" target=\"_NEW\"> Cato St conspiracy</a> of 1820, was pathetic.</p> <p>When it comes to protesting, though, the British are past-masters, with a long, proud tradition of dismantling property and hurling bits of it at the authorities. The <a href=\"http://www.britannia.com/history/docs/peasant.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> Peasants' Revolt of 1381</a> was an early example. Wat Tyler and the others didn't want power, they wanted rid of the poll tax. It ended in tears, of course, but it worked - just as it <a href=\"http://www.caliach.com/paulr/violence/riots/polltax.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> worked again in 1990</a>. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.</p> <p>A vintage period for homogenous Anglo-Saxon rioting, <a href=\"http://www.londonnet.co.uk/ln/guide/themes/rebel-london-history.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> especially in London</a>, began in 1750. Any excuse was good enough: in 1752 Britain decided to join the European common time zone, represented by the new-fangled Gregorian calendar, devised nearly 300 years earlier. Eleven days were removed from the old Julian version, causing simple minded people to believe their lives had been shortened, and giving them just the excuse they wanted to bash up the town. In 1780 <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/LONgordon.htm\" target=\"_NEW\"> Lord George Gordon</a> roused the mob with fearful tales of what would befall if Roman Catholics were given civil rights. The army was called out, more than 100 rioters were shot dead, and at least 20 were hanged. Lord Gordon was acquitted, partly at least because he was barking mad.</p> <p>The early 1800s were vintage riot years. Town and country were both seething with unrest in the <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRstrikes.htm\" target=\"_NEW\"> depressed aftermath</a> of the Napoleonic wars. The authorities quelled the unrest with bloody rigour. Sometimes, as in the <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/peterloo.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> Peterloo massacre</a> of 1819, they went in for pre-emptive quelling. But the unrest was real enough on other occasions. In the woeful (but wonderfully named)l <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/CHplug.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Plug Plot riots</a>, factory workers disabled their machines by removing the plugs from the boilers. <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRluddites.htm\" target=\"_NEW\"> Luddites</a> - followers of the mythical General Ned Ludd - smashed the industrial machinery which was destroying their craft jobs. They've been doing it ever since. A more political protest erupted in the 1830s and 40s with the <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/chartism.htm\" target=\"_NEW\"> Chartist movement</a>, campaigning for radical social and parliamentary reform. This was a time when revolutionaries were <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/history/courses/europe1/chron/48pr.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">creating mayhem across Europe</a>. The Chartists, being British, organised marches, got up petitions, and chucked the odd brick.</p> <p>The second half of the 19th century was more decorous, but the 20th started in fine style with the movement for <a href=\"http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/women.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">women's suffrage</a> and a new surge of industrial unrest. The end of the first world war saw the first outbreak of what was to become, sadly, a new British phenomenon: the <a href=\"http://www.blackpresence.co.uk/html/riots.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">race riots of 1919</a> presaged the nasty confrontation in <a href=\"http://www.thehill.co.uk/background.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Notting Hill in 1958</a>, and a dismal succession of similar events.</p> <p>Growing prosperity has, on the face of it, done nothing to blunt our enthusiasm for a 'donnybrook' (an excellent Irish expression meaning riotous assembly). In the 1980s <a href=\"http://www.astoncharities.org.uk/research/socialnetworks/urbmnet.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">inner city rage</a> exploded in Liverpool, Bristol, Birmingham and, most bloodily perhaps, in Brixton in South London and the <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/history/broadwater_farm.htm\" target=\"_NEW\"> Broadwater Farm</a> estate in North London. The most spectacular spasm of violence in recent times was the poll tax riot of 1990. It may have been 609 years after the Peasants' Revolt, but Wat Tyler would have recognised the rage, the fear, and the exhileration of a nation indulging in one of its favourite pastimes.</p> <p><a href=\"MAIL TO:DBROWN445@AOL.COM\">dbrown445@aol.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mayday/\">Special report: Mayday 2001</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "We may not care much for those who rule over us, but by and large, we let them go about their business in peace. The last time - some would say the only time - that we overthrew the system was in the 1640s. Trading-in Charles I for Oliver Cromwell was frankly quite stupid, so we've never done it again. One Civil War was quite enough, thank you. Bonnie Prince Charlie made a mild stab at revolution in 1745, but that was more to do with changing the management than changing the system. Since then, there have been plenty of radical attempts to change the order of things, but the outcome of most of them, like the wretched Cato St conspiracy of 1820, was pathetic. When it comes to protesting, though, the British are past-masters, with a long, proud tradition of dismantling property and hurling bits of it at the authorities. The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 was an early example. Wat Tyler and the others didn't want power, they wanted rid of the poll tax. It ended in tears, of course, but it worked - just as it worked again in 1990. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. A vintage period for homogenous Anglo-Saxon rioting, especially in London, began in 1750. Any excuse was good enough: in 1752 Britain decided to join the European common time zone, represented by the new-fangled Gregorian calendar, devised nearly 300 years earlier. Eleven days were removed from the old Julian version, causing simple minded people to believe their lives had been shortened, and giving them just the excuse they wanted to bash up the town. In 1780 Lord George Gordon roused the mob with fearful tales of what would befall if Roman Catholics were given civil rights. The army was called out, more than 100 rioters were shot dead, and at least 20 were hanged. Lord Gordon was acquitted, partly at least because he was barking mad. The early 1800s were vintage riot years. Town and country were both seething with unrest in the depressed aftermath of the Napoleonic wars. The authorities quelled the unrest with bloody rigour. Sometimes, as in the Peterloo massacre of 1819, they went in for pre-emptive quelling. But the unrest was real enough on other occasions. In the woeful (but wonderfully named)l Plug Plot riots, factory workers disabled their machines by removing the plugs from the boilers. Luddites - followers of the mythical General Ned Ludd - smashed the industrial machinery which was destroying their craft jobs. They've been doing it ever since. A more political protest erupted in the 1830s and 40s with the Chartist movement, campaigning for radical social and parliamentary reform. This was a time when revolutionaries were creating mayhem across Europe. The Chartists, being British, organised marches, got up petitions, and chucked the odd brick. The second half of the 19th century was more decorous, but the 20th started in fine style with the movement for women's suffrage and a new surge of industrial unrest. The end of the first world war saw the first outbreak of what was to become, sadly, a new British phenomenon: the race riots of 1919 presaged the nasty confrontation in Notting Hill in 1958, and a dismal succession of similar events. Growing prosperity has, on the face of it, done nothing to blunt our enthusiasm for a 'donnybrook' (an excellent Irish expression meaning riotous assembly). In the 1980s inner city rage exploded in Liverpool, Bristol, Birmingham and, most bloodily perhaps, in Brixton in South London and the Broadwater Farm estate in North London. The most spectacular spasm of violence in recent times was the poll tax riot of 1990. It may have been 609 years after the Peasants' Revolt, but Wat Tyler would have recognised the rage, the fear, and the exhileration of a nation indulging in one of its favourite pastimes. dbrown445@aol.com Special report: Mayday 2001",

Culture secretary Chris Smith said the money would support the British Tourist Authority's new advertising campaign to hammer home the message that Britain is still a great place for a holiday. It is hoped the adverts will help reverse estimated losses to the tourism industry of up to \u00a32.5bn of its \u00a313bn-a-year trade. The cash adds to a previous \u00a36m boost for tourism advertising and brings to more than \u00a3250m the total government support given to business in the wake of the outbreak. Mr Smith said the countryside was \"returning to normal\" and that it was vital to get the message across to potential visitors from overseas that Britain was open for business. \"The British countryside is returning to normal and it is important that we get this message across both at home and abroad,\" he said. \"Tourists need to know what we all know - that Britain is a great holiday destination. This money will help that effort.\" The new cash will go to Britain's tourist boards to be spent on adverts and other marketing initiatives, which Whitehall sources said had been shown to produce \u00a330 of tourist spending for every \u00a31 spent. New research by the BTA has shown that 85% of attractions are now open and 93% of events are due to go ahead as planned, despite the disruption caused by foot-and-mouth. The UK's top 10 visitor attractions and top 10 admission fee-charging heritage properties are all open. \"I am pleased the government has recognised the urgent need to invest in overseas tourism promotion,\" said BTA chairman David Quarmby said. \"We can now get straight on with promotional activities in all the affected markets to boost visits from overseas for the summer, and with initiating a longer-term programme to re-present Britain to the world, starting in the autumn.\"",

Many companies do want to engage in that debate,\" he added. Nike said it would be happy to have a dialogue with protesters, but not when violence was involved. \"We would want to talk to people who come to us in a peaceful and sensible way, we are a transparent and responsible company. But there is no possibility for dialogue in this situation,\" said a spokesman. A spokesman for McDonald's said: \"We respect individuals' right to protest as long as it is democratically legitimate and peaceful. \"But we regard the points raised on the May Day Monopoly website - about our wages, selling meat and environmental issues - as misplaced,\" he added.",

The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children [SPUC] will now dispute the legality of the government's reclassification of the Levonelle-2 pill at a full hearing before the end of July. The drug, which SPUC says delivers 50 times the dosage of the daily mini-pill contraceptive, was made available from pharmacists without the need for a doctor's prescription in January this year. The society's counsel, Richard Gordon QC, told Mr Justice Scott Baker that the change was unlawful under 19th century legislation because it permitted the commission of the administration or supply of poisons or instruments with the intent to procure miscarriage. The 1861 Offences Against the Person Act prohibits the supply of \"any poison or other noxious thing... with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman, whether she be or be not with child\". Mr Gordon said that there was a strongly arguable case which raised very serious medical and legal issues. \"It is the wider availability and the concomitant social effects which has caused SPUC to be concerned,\" he said. Granting permission, the judge said he was persuaded that an issue existed that required resolution and it was better that it was decided in the civil courts than by way of private prosecutions brought in respect of specific supplies of the drug. \"There is an arguable case on what is fundamentally a very important question,\" he added. John Smeaton, SPUC's national director, said recently: \"Our case centres on the undeniable fact that the morning-after pill can cause the death of a newly conceived human being by preventing his or her implantation in the womb. \"Thus the morning-after pill can cause an early abortion, and should be subject to the controls set out in the 1967 Abortion Act.\" Mr Smeaton said SPUC was \"morally obliged\" to oppose the wider availability of the morning-after pill and said that the pill could not be accurately described as a contraceptive because \"it can cause the death of a newly-conceived embryo.\" \"It denies distinct and unique human individuals their right to life, and we cannot stand back and let this deception continue without raising our voices to defend the truth,\" he added.",

      "bodyText": "One of Sky News's most respected journalists has taken a swipe at the BBC over its coverage of Sir Christopher Bland's appointment as the chairman of BT. At today's launch of Sky News's election coverage, Adam Boulton, the station's political editor, criticised the BBC's business editor, Jeff Randall, who was the first to broadcast the BT story. Mr Boulton said: \"We don't have to decide - as the BBC did last week with the announcement its chairman Sir Christopher Bland was to be the chairman of BT - whether to hold something for 5 Live or to give it to the Today programme.\" His remarks follow Mr Randall's robust denial this week that he was \"given\" the Today programme's exclusive story about Sir Christopher's appointment. Speaking as he and Nick Pollard, Sky News's head of news, unveiled Sky News's election coverage, Mr Boulton said Sky News \"did not suffer from brand dilution\", unlike the BBC and ITN. He argued that Sky News's round-the-clock coverage meant it was better able to avoid the \"soundbite culture\" that dogged the terrestrial bulletins. \"We've got the time to broaden that coverage out beyond simply reporting what the party spokesmen say,\" he said. Sky News's interactive service, Sky News Active, will offer \"party channels\" with coverage of each political party's activity in the run-up to the election. Mr Pollard would not comment on the progress of the bid by the Channel Three consortium - which includes Sky News - for the ITV news franchise. But he said he was confident about Sky News's reputation for quality and impartiality. He said: \"The idea that you could point to any part of our output and say it is biased or slanted or shows in effect a corporate view [reflecting its parent company BskyB] is nonsense.\" Related stories 27.05.2001: ITC mulls ITV news bid MediaGuardian.co.uk special report General election in the media",

There he would grant interviews to visiting journalists, patiently explaining the republican cause for which he fought.</p> <p>It was not considered the done thing to ask for his rank and standing in the Provisional IRA, which had then been in existence barely a year. It was tacitly understood - and never denied - that McGuinness was, in the grandiloquent language of the movement, the Derry brigade commander.Today, more than a generation later, McGuinness has broken cover and admitted, to the surprise of absolutely nobody, that he was indeed a ranking IRA man in the first and bloodiest days of the modern Troubles.</p> <p>He has told a press conference that he was the IRA's second-in-command in Derry on the day of the Bloody Sunday killings.</p> <p>We are in no position to contradict him, but those of us who reported regularly from Derry (our datelines said Londonderry) in the early 1970s had the clear impression that he ruled the IRA roost.</p> <p>Then, as now, McGuinness was softly spoken, courteous, and greatly given to barrack-room lawyering. His language was convoluted; his loyalty and commitment unmistakable. Unlike other IRA leaders, he understood the value of putting over his message to the British press, in spite of its almost unqualified hostility to militant republicanism.</p> <p>In 1971, there was an ugly spate of attacks on Catholic girls who went out with British soldiers based in the city. At least three had their heads shaved and were publicly daubed with tar. It was in the days when Bogside and the neighbouring estate of Creggan were no-go areas for the police, and the army could only enter in armoured vehicles. Reporters could come and go with relative ease, for example to the Bogside gasworks which functioned as the IRA's ad hoc headquarters, but during the tar-and-feathering episode, we were made distinctly unwelcome.</p> <p>On one occasion, following up a report that yet another young woman had been publicly humiliated, I walked into Bogside, and was confronted by a youth who told me to leave in no uncertain terms. I argued with him and dropped some names of republican contacts, including that of Martin McGuinness. The young man scowled, opened his jacket, and produced the biggest automatic pistol I had ever seen. I made an excuse and left.</p> <p>McGuinness would not, I think, have sanctioned such crudeness. Indeed, a couple of days later he organised an unprecedented press conference, held in a council house in Creggan, at which four IRA men pledged there would be no more attacks on army girlfriends. The pledge was fulfilled.</p> <p>That was just three months before Bloody Sunday. Now McGuinness is to appear before the Saville inquiry to admit his leading IRA role - and to deny with vehemence the suggestion, repeated by his enemies over the years, that he fired the shot which provoked the mass killing.</p> <p>Indeed, the suggestion seems ludicrous. McGuinness always took pride in the discipline of the Derry brigade, and the care it took to avoid civilian casualties. He used to boast, quietly, that his men never planted a bomb without warning, and would never countenance sectarian assassination. That he or any other member of the IRA would have opened fire in the midst of a peaceful mass march, is barely credible.</p> <p><a href=\"MAIL TO:DBROWN445@AOL.COM\">dbrown445@aol.com</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bloodysunday/article/0,2763,481938,00.html\">02.05.2001: I was IRA chief, admits McGuinness</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,481632,00.html\">02.05.2001: Special branch accused of suppressing confession</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,481226,00.html\">01.05.2001: McGuinness vows to clear IRA of role in Derry killings </a></p> <p><b>More on Guardian Unlimited</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Northern_Ireland/0,2759,446746,00.html\">Special report: Northern Ireland </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/bloodysunday/\">Special report: Bloody Sunday</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Northern_Ireland/flash/0,6189,344692,00.html\">Interactive guide: People, history and politics in Northern Ireland </a><br></p> <p><b>Useful sites</b><br><a href=\"http://sinnfein.ie\" target=\"_new\">Sinn Fein</a> <br> <a href=\"http://sinnfein.ie/documents/martin.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Sinn Fein profile of Martin McGuinness</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.com/cgi-bin/todaysnews\" target=\"_new\"> Belfast Telegraph</a> <br> <a href=\"http://scripts.ireland.com/tardis.plx?main=newspaper/front\" target=\"_new\">Irish Times</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.irishnews.com\" target=\"_new\">Irish News</a> <br> <a href=\"http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/bsunday/chron.htm\" target=\"_new\"> Bloody Sunday chronology: Conflict Archive on the Internet</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.bloody-sunday-inquiry.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Saville Inquiry</a></p>",

We are in no position to contradict him, but those of us who reported regularly from Derry (our datelines said Londonderry) in the early 1970s had the clear impression that he ruled the IRA roost. Then, as now, McGuinness was softly spoken, courteous, and greatly given to barrack-room lawyering. His language was convoluted; his loyalty and commitment unmistakable. Unlike other IRA leaders, he understood the value of putting over his message to the British press, in spite of its almost unqualified hostility to militant republicanism. In 1971, there was an ugly spate of attacks on Catholic girls who went out with British soldiers based in the city. At least three had their heads shaved and were publicly daubed with tar. It was in the days when Bogside and the neighbouring estate of Creggan were no-go areas for the police, and the army could only enter in armoured vehicles. Reporters could come and go with relative ease, for example to the Bogside gasworks which functioned as the IRA's ad hoc headquarters, but during the tar-and-feathering episode, we were made distinctly unwelcome. On one occasion, following up a report that yet another young woman had been publicly humiliated, I walked into Bogside, and was confronted by a youth who told me to leave in no uncertain terms. I argued with him and dropped some names of republican contacts, including that of Martin McGuinness. The young man scowled, opened his jacket, and produced the biggest automatic pistol I had ever seen. I made an excuse and left. McGuinness would not, I think, have sanctioned such crudeness. Indeed, a couple of days later he organised an unprecedented press conference, held in a council house in Creggan, at which four IRA men pledged there would be no more attacks on army girlfriends. The pledge was fulfilled. That was just three months before Bloody Sunday. Now McGuinness is to appear before the Saville inquiry to admit his leading IRA role - and to deny with vehemence the suggestion, repeated by his enemies over the years, that he fired the shot which provoked the mass killing. Indeed, the suggestion seems ludicrous. McGuinness always took pride in the discipline of the Derry brigade, and the care it took to avoid civilian casualties. He used to boast, quietly, that his men never planted a bomb without warning, and would never countenance sectarian assassination. That he or any other member of the IRA would have opened fire in the midst of a peaceful mass march, is barely credible. dbrown445@aol.com Related articles 02.05.2001: I was IRA chief, admits McGuinness 02.05.2001: Special branch accused of suppressing confession 01.05.2001: McGuinness vows to clear IRA of role in Derry killings More on Guardian Unlimited Special report: Northern Ireland Special report: Bloody Sunday Interactive guide: People, history and politics in Northern Ireland Useful sites Sinn Fein Sinn Fein profile of Martin McGuinness Belfast Telegraph Irish Times Irish News Bloody Sunday chronology: Conflict Archive on the Internet Saville Inquiry",

Ukonline has already created controversy over a \u00a3400,000 advertising budget since its launch in February.

The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children [SPUC] will now dispute the legality of the government's reclassification of the Levonelle-2 pill at a full hearing before the end of July. The drug, which SPUC says delivers 50 times the dosage of the daily mini-pill contraceptive, was made available from pharmacists without the need for a doctor's prescription in January this year. The society's counsel, Richard Gordon QC, told Mr Justice Scott Baker that the change was unlawful under 19th century legislation because it permitted the commission of the administration or supply of poisons or instruments with the intent to procure miscarriage. The 1861 Offences Against the Person Act prohibits the supply of \"any poison or other noxious thing... with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman, whether she be or be not with child\". Mr Gordon said that there was a strongly arguable case which raised very serious medical and legal issues. \"It is the wider availability and the concomitant social effects which has caused SPUC to be concerned,\" he said. Granting permission, the judge said he was persuaded that an issue existed that required resolution and it was better that it was decided in the civil courts than by way of private prosecutions brought in respect of specific supplies of the drug. \"There is an arguable case on what is fundamentally a very important question,\" he added. John Smeaton, SPUC's national director, said recently: \"Our case centres on the undeniable fact that the morning-after pill can cause the death of a newly conceived human being by preventing his or her implantation in the womb. \"Thus the morning-after pill can cause an early abortion, and should be subject to the controls set out in the 1967 Abortion Act.\" Mr Smeaton said SPUC was \"morally obliged\" to oppose the wider availability of the morning-after pill and said that the pill could not be accurately described as a contraceptive because \"it can cause the death of a newly-conceived embryo.\" \"It denies distinct and unique human individuals their right to life, and we cannot stand back and let this deception continue without raising our voices to defend the truth,\" he added.

The tenor will go on trial for alleged tax evasion in his birthplace, the northern Italian city of Modena, after failing to squash a legal saga. The biggest-earning opera virtuoso in history is accused of dodging \u00a313m between 1989-95, when he catapulted to world fame singing Nessun Dorma for the 1990 World Cup.

      "body": "<p>The home secretary, Jack Straw, will meet with a group of specially appointed officials in the next few weeks to discuss the Wembley stadium debacle and how it can be rescued from financial ruin. The ministerial working group, which includes the culture secretary, Chris Smith, and representatives from the City and football, will appoint an outside expert to examine the different options for salvaging the \u00a3660m national stadium project, which has caused severe embarrassment within government and sports circles as it has lurched from crisis to crisis.</p> <p>Last December, Chelsea chairman Ken Bates, who headed Wembley National Stadium Ltd, the FA subsidiary company set up to oversee the project, was forced to step down after his plans proved too elaborate and costly. This resulted in City institutions refusing to fund the project. Sir Rodney Walker, head of the UK Sports Council, replaced Mr Bates and has spent the last few weeks assuring the City that the FA was willing to pledge \u00a3100m to the project.The FA was attempting to raise \u00a3400m from the City.</p> <p>The latest setback has put the government in the driving seat and Mr Straw and his team will examine a number of options to revive the project. The working group will also attempt to resolve the vexed question of \u00a3120m of lottery money, which was given to WNSL to buy the Wembley site. The money has been spent but will have to be paid back if existing plans for a national stadium are changed.</p> <p>A number of options will be presented to Mr Straw's ministerial working group:</p> <p><b> 1 Refurbishing the existing Wembley</b></p> <p>This is an option that few within government or the FA favour. The current Wembley stadium is derelict and the pitch already dug up. Under this proposal, the outside structure of the stadium would not change but catering facilities, seats and pitch would be modernised. The capacity of a redeveloped Wembley stadium would only be around 65,000. This is considered a short term option that would not help a future England bid for a major tournament such as the World Cup or European Championship. Privately, the FA has already told the government that it is against refurbishment. But it would prove to be cheap and the stadium could be reopened within two years. It would also mean that the FA would not have to pay back the \u00a3120m lottery money it was given because a revamped stadium falls within the lottery agreement. <br><b> Chances 1/10</b></p> <p><b> 2 New site for a national stadium</b></p> <p>Both Ken Bates, former chairman of WNSL, and Sir Rodney Walker, the current chairman, told a select committee of MPs they were not in favour of a new national stadium being constructed on the site of the existing Wembley stadium. Mr Bates backed Manchester while Mr Walker said that a stadium somewhere in the midlands - perhaps Milton Keynes - would have been a better option. The min isterial working group and influential people within the FA, are keen that a new site option is closely examined. A stadium in the midlands, the favoured option, would allow easy access to the majority of the country if it was constructed close to a motorway and railway station with enough room for parking and conference facilites. Land and construction costs would be much cheaper.</p> <p>Some within the FA believe a state-of-the art national stadium outside London could be built for under \u00a3300m. This option is backed by a number of football chairmen. Like Wembley, the neutral venue would be used for England international matches, end of the season play-off matches and all cup finals. If this option is chosen the lottery money would have to be returned. <br> <b> Chances 8/10</b></p> <p><b> 3 Ground share national stadium</b></p> <p>Sources within the FA have revealed that a possible ground share with a Premiership team playing at a national stadium is another option they are considering. Some talks have taken place with Arsenal on a possible ground share at a new Wembley. This would please City institutions, who would be more willing to fund the project knowing that there was going to be regular income. At least two home matches a month would take place at the new stadium, and all construction and running costs could be split with the football club that shares it.</p> <p>One of the main problems could lie with Brent council, the local authority. It has said that planning permission has been granted for a national stadium and not for a league stadium, where regular matches would take place. Wembley residents are against such a plan. The lottery funding agreement would also have to be changed with the \u00a3120m returned.</p> <p>David Dein, who is on the FA board and deputy chairman of Arsenal, supports this option. The north London club want to move from their ground at Highbury to a new ground close by, a plan opposed by residents. Mr Dein believes that sharing the national stadium could solve his problems if Arsenal are denied planning permission for a new ground in north London. <br><b> Chances 5/10</b></p> <p><b> 4 No national stadium</b></p> <p>Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Portugal and other leading football nations do not have a national stadium. The FA chief execu tive, Adam Crozier, has said that the current practice of England touring around the country has worked well, leading to large crowds and good atmospheres, even for friendlies -something that was not always the case at the old Wembley. Given that a number of Premiership grounds have a capacity of over 50,000, hosting England internationals would not be a problem.</p> <p>The FA is prepared to do without a national stadium if the project cannot be rescued by the government. There could however, be problems in fixing dates for matches if internationals are only played at club grounds (matches could clash) and it would also be a major dent to the FA's prestige, given the importance once attached to Wembley. <br><b> Chances 4/10</b></p> <p><b>5 Stick with existing plans</b></p> <p>That would mean the government underwrites the entire project and a new stadium is built as currently planned. <br><b> Chances: Will probably depend on the outcome of the general election</b></p> <p><b> 6 Return to the orginal brief</b></p> <p>Wembley would become an 80,000-capacity stadium capable of hosting athletics and other sports. It would also allow for a British Olympic bid. This option would also include an adjoining athletics track for warming up. Opponents claim that spectators would be too far away from the pitch during football matches, affecting the atmosphere, and the sight lines in the stadium make for poor viewing. <br><b> Chances 6/10</b></p> <p><b>Countdown to failure</b></p> <p><b> September </b> Australian construction company Multiplex will sign contract to build stadium for \u00a3326.5m. Plans to open the new ground with the 2003 FA Cup Final are shelved</p> <p><b> October </b> Demolition work put back indefinitely as bankers Chase Manhattan fail to raise the \u00a3410m required</p> <p><b> December</b> Sir Rodney Walker appointed chairman of WNSL in place of Chelsea chairman Ken Bates</p> <p><b> February 2001</b> Bates quits the WNSL board, claiming senior government and FA figures undermined him</p> <p><b> May 1</b> FA admits the project is doomed unless the government bails it out</p>",

The latest setback has put the government in the driving seat and Mr Straw and his team will examine a number of options to revive the project. The working group will also attempt to resolve the vexed question of \u00a3120m of lottery money, which was given to WNSL to buy the Wembley site. The money has been spent but will have to be paid back if existing plans for a national stadium are changed. A number of options will be presented to Mr Straw's ministerial working group: 1 Refurbishing the existing Wembley This is an option that few within government or the FA favour. The current Wembley stadium is derelict and the pitch already dug up. Under this proposal, the outside structure of the stadium would not change but catering facilities, seats and pitch would be modernised. The capacity of a redeveloped Wembley stadium would only be around 65,000. This is considered a short term option that would not help a future England bid for a major tournament such as the World Cup or European Championship. Privately, the FA has already told the government that it is against refurbishment. But it would prove to be cheap and the stadium could be reopened within two years. It would also mean that the FA would not have to pay back the \u00a3120m lottery money it was given because a revamped stadium falls within the lottery agreement. Chances 1/10 2 New site for a national stadium Both Ken Bates, former chairman of WNSL, and Sir Rodney Walker, the current chairman, told a select committee of MPs they were not in favour of a new national stadium being constructed on the site of the existing Wembley stadium. Mr Bates backed Manchester while Mr Walker said that a stadium somewhere in the midlands - perhaps Milton Keynes - would have been a better option. The min isterial working group and influential people within the FA, are keen that a new site option is closely examined. A stadium in the midlands, the favoured option, would allow easy access to the majority of the country if it was constructed close to a motorway and railway station with enough room for parking and conference facilites. Land and construction costs would be much cheaper. Some within the FA believe a state-of-the art national stadium outside London could be built for under \u00a3300m. This option is backed by a number of football chairmen. Like Wembley, the neutral venue would be used for England international matches, end of the season play-off matches and all cup finals. If this option is chosen the lottery money would have to be returned. Chances 8/10 3 Ground share national stadium Sources within the FA have revealed that a possible ground share with a Premiership team playing at a national stadium is another option they are considering. Some talks have taken place with Arsenal on a possible ground share at a new Wembley. This would please City institutions, who would be more willing to fund the project knowing that there was going to be regular income. At least two home matches a month would take place at the new stadium, and all construction and running costs could be split with the football club that shares it. One of the main problems could lie with Brent council, the local authority. It has said that planning permission has been granted for a national stadium and not for a league stadium, where regular matches would take place. Wembley residents are against such a plan. The lottery funding agreement would also have to be changed with the \u00a3120m returned. David Dein, who is on the FA board and deputy chairman of Arsenal, supports this option. The north London club want to move from their ground at Highbury to a new ground close by, a plan opposed by residents. Mr Dein believes that sharing the national stadium could solve his problems if Arsenal are denied planning permission for a new ground in north London. Chances 5/10 4 No national stadium Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Portugal and other leading football nations do not have a national stadium. The FA chief execu tive, Adam Crozier, has said that the current practice of England touring around the country has worked well, leading to large crowds and good atmospheres, even for friendlies -something that was not always the case at the old Wembley. Given that a number of Premiership grounds have a capacity of over 50,000, hosting England internationals would not be a problem. The FA is prepared to do without a national stadium if the project cannot be rescued by the government. There could however, be problems in fixing dates for matches if internationals are only played at club grounds (matches could clash) and it would also be a major dent to the FA's prestige, given the importance once attached to Wembley. Chances 4/10 5 Stick with existing plans That would mean the government underwrites the entire project and a new stadium is built as currently planned. Chances: Will probably depend on the outcome of the general election 6 Return to the orginal brief Wembley would become an 80,000-capacity stadium capable of hosting athletics and other sports. It would also allow for a British Olympic bid. This option would also include an adjoining athletics track for warming up. Opponents claim that spectators would be too far away from the pitch during football matches, affecting the atmosphere, and the sight lines in the stadium make for poor viewing. Chances 6/10 Countdown to failure September Australian construction company Multiplex will sign contract to build stadium for \u00a3326.5m. Plans to open the new ground with the 2003 FA Cup Final are shelved October Demolition work put back indefinitely as bankers Chase Manhattan fail to raise the \u00a3410m required December Sir Rodney Walker appointed chairman of WNSL in place of Chelsea chairman Ken Bates February 2001 Bates quits the WNSL board, claiming senior government and FA figures undermined him May 1 FA admits the project is doomed unless the government bails it out",

Russia offered more mixed reactions to President Bush's speech last night, but military sources warned the plans could spark a new arms race. Chinese state news agency Xinhua, often a mouthpiece for the Chinese government, highlighted criticism of the plan by experts. \"Analysts said the US plan to build a missile defence system will not only spark a new arms race and create a proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but will also threaten world peace and security in the 21st century,\" Xinhua reported. US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld has partially justified Mr Bush's announcement by citing China's missile build-up. Tensions between the US and China have risen since American labelled China as a \"strategic competitor\" and because of the row over the American spy plane that collided with a Chinese fighter. China feels aggrieved by America's project as it could render useless its small nuclear deterrent of 20 warheads. Mr Bush yesterday vowed to press ahead with the deployment of the missile defence system, arguing that the world had moved beyond the outdated framework of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty with Russia. The treaty banned missile defence systems, in order to curb the temptation of a first-strike nuclear attack during the cold war. Russian misgivings about ditching the ABM treaty were reiterated by Russian MP and head of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, Dmitry Rogozin. \"If the United States actually go through with their intention to abandon the 1972 treaty, that would destroy the entire security system we have today,\" Mr Rogozin told the Interfax news agency. While Moscow reacted positively to proposed cuts in the US nuclear arsenal, which it said could pave the way for \"a renewal of Russian-US consultations on strategic stability in general\", Russian military and diplomatic sources re-iterated warnings of the dangers of scrapping the ABM treaty. The sources were quoted by Interfax as saying: \"Many in Washington understand that the destruction of ABM and deploying an anti-missile shield could undermine the system of strategic stability which exists in the world today and lead to a new arms race\" South Korea also signalled unease over the US plan by appealing to Mr Bush to closely consult with allies before deploying its missile shield, designed to defend the US and its allies from missile attacks by \"rogue\" states such as North Korea and Iraq. The Japanese response was more reticent, with Japanese officials saying that Tokyo would decide whether to support Mr Bush's proposals after examining the diplomatic and security implications of the new US nuclear strategy. But Japan is concerned that the \"son of star wars\" project will cause a regional arms race as China speeds up its missile build-up, triggering similar moves in India and Pakistan.

At the time of its 1999 relaunch, pundits pointed to the parallels of the magazines, both launched just after a general election had swept away a long-period of Tory rule, both celebrating a new sense of joie de vivre and national pride. Less than two years on, that joie-de-vivre is notably absent from the publishing industry. With the prospect of a recession looming and the Labour honeymoon period very much over, it seems almost fitting that the magazine should be biting the dust. Magazine journalism veterans claim that Nova Mk II was always a pale shadow of its former self. Launched in 1965 by what was then the Mirror Group's magazines division (which became IPC), under editor Dennis Hackett, Nova had a huge impact on the fashion of the day, launching the career of the renowned Molly Parkin. Its design became synonymous with the kind of style we now think epitomises the cusp of the 60s and 80s. Nova never shied away from the kind of fodder which would now be written off as too highbrow for women's magazine reader, famously carrying a feature about homosexual law reform. And it showed that aspirational and intelligent are not mutually exclusive, showcasing the culinary talents of the venerable Elizabeth David. Caroline Baker, a journalist on the original magazine and now fashion director at You magazine, said she was not surprised by the closure. \"It was exactly like all the other magazines and failed to capture the British public's imagination. They should have left the old one alone, not tried to bring it back.\"",

The last government averaged \u00a3395m a year investment in the tube. And although this government has raised core investment to over \u00a3500m a year, we need to secure much more to transform the tube.</p> <p>That is what the public private partnership (PPP) will do. It will end the short-term financial uncertainty that has plagued the tube for years and it will guarantee long-term investment on an unprecedented scale. It will deliver better reliability, improved safety and security (with CCTV in every carriage). Every train will be replaced or refurbished and every station will also be refurbished or modernised, with many stations completely rebuilt.</p> <p>The PPP is not privatisation. Most staff and functions will remain with the publicly owned London Underground, which will operate all the trains, signals and stations. The assets will remain in public ownership. Private contractors will rebuild or fix the infrastructure, on 30-year contracts and, on completion, the infrastructure will be returned to London Underground. What is so special about the PPP is that major companies will be paid by results, be responsible for overspends and invest their own capital in improving the tube.</p> <p>You suggest the PPP is unsafe. I challenge you, as I have done the mayor, to back that up with evidence. London Underground is already one of the safest metros in the world - with a better safety record than cities like New York or Paris. Under the PPP, London Underground will continue to have overall responsibility for safety. We have always made clear the PPP cannot go ahead unless the safety case is approved and accepted by the independent health and safety executive (HSE). <br> <b>John Prescott MP</b><br>Deputy prime minister</p>",

      "bodyText": "Your leader (May 1) says we will be paying for the government's tube plans for 30 years. The truth is we are all paying for decades of under-investment in the London underground. The last government averaged \u00a3395m a year investment in the tube. And although this government has raised core investment to over \u00a3500m a year, we need to secure much more to transform the tube. That is what the public private partnership (PPP) will do. It will end the short-term financial uncertainty that has plagued the tube for years and it will guarantee long-term investment on an unprecedented scale. It will deliver better reliability, improved safety and security (with CCTV in every carriage). Every train will be replaced or refurbished and every station will also be refurbished or modernised, with many stations completely rebuilt. The PPP is not privatisation. Most staff and functions will remain with the publicly owned London Underground, which will operate all the trains, signals and stations. The assets will remain in public ownership. Private contractors will rebuild or fix the infrastructure, on 30-year contracts and, on completion, the infrastructure will be returned to London Underground. What is so special about the PPP is that major companies will be paid by results, be responsible for overspends and invest their own capital in improving the tube. You suggest the PPP is unsafe. I challenge you, as I have done the mayor, to back that up with evidence. London Underground is already one of the safest metros in the world - with a better safety record than cities like New York or Paris. Under the PPP, London Underground will continue to have overall responsibility for safety. We have always made clear the PPP cannot go ahead unless the safety case is approved and accepted by the independent health and safety executive (HSE). John Prescott MP Deputy prime minister",

Yes, we have a shortage of midwives, but one of the reasons midwives have left the NHS is that they can't get on with the job they do best. There needs to be a major review of how health professionals work in maternity care and the greater contribution that can be made by clerical staff and maternity assistants. I welcome the commitment to providing women with the choice of where they give birth, although thought needs to be given as to how this is practically achieved. One of the reasons that there are wide variations in the home birth rate is due to the commitment of midwifery managers and the organisation of midwifery services so that midwives can provide and offer home birth without detriment to their personal lives. If there were a commitment to providing each midwife who provides home birth with her own equipment and a mobile phone, this would increase women's choices, but of course it costs money. I welcome the targets for reducing health inequalities, but the range of sure start schemes around the country need to be rigorously evaluated.

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch's audacious bid to set up a global satellite TV network complete with a US arm has moved a step closer after the owners of America's DirecTV formally agreed to start merger talks. The takeover bid has been in the offing for more than six months and on several occasions looked as if it would be stymied. But Mr Murdoch's decision last week to personally intervene in the talks appears to have paid off. General Motors, the owner of DirecTV's parent company, Hughes Electronics, last night agreed to start merger negotiations with Mr Murdoch's media group. Although the GM board has far from rubber-stamped a deal, it is a huge step forward for Mr Murdoch, who appeared to have given up on the takeover a month ago. A News Corp spokesman described the GM decision as \"a vote of confidence\" in the revised offer. GM's hand was forced after it failed to find a rival bidder for its subsidiary, and Mr Murdoch took charge of negotiations with the car manufacturer's reluctant executives. A successful deal will see Mr Murdoch realise his dream of forming the world's largest satellite TV broadcaster, with stations spanning the US, Latin America, Asia, Australia and Europe. The group, to be called Sky Global Networks, will include News Corp's 37.5% holding in BSkyB and will take Hughes Electronics's US stock market listing. However, it is almost certain Mr Murdoch has been forced into a series of compromises in order to push the complex deal to its latest stage. It is believed News Corp's proposed holding in the group has been reduced from 35% to 30%, while the management of Hughes Electronics will have greater influence in the newly formed company. DirecTV provides the perfect gateway to the US satellite TV market, with 9.5m subscribers.

As the clean-up operation got under way in central London to repair the damage caused after yesterday's stand-off at Oxford Circus, 14 protesters were due to appear before Bow Street magistrates and one at West London. Police made 92 arrests yesterday - including eight people from Denmark, Poland, Belgium and the United States - and among the weapons seized were a loaded airgun and a martial arts weapon. Over 50 people were injured and 29 needed hospital treatment, the London ambulance service said. They included three police officers, one of whom was a female officer who lost consciousness in the crush but was later discharged from hospital. This morning, shopkeepers returned to Tottenham Court Road, the scene of the worst vandalism when protesters smashed the windows of several stores. The windows of the Habitat store were boarded up today after large sections of the shop front were smashed in. A nearby Heal's furniture shop had also been forced to put up boarding, after a large pane of glass was smashed. Boarding had also been put over smashed windows and fronts at branches of Abbey National, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Demonstrators smashed in large sections of the glass front of the Tesco branch in Goodge Street, off Tottenham Court Road. Store manager Leigh Haynes said the supermarket was open at the time but that staff and shoppers had been evacuated before the attack took place. But Sovat Din, an employee of The Pier, a furnishing store in Tottenham Court Road, said that shop remained open throughout yesterday. \"We had a meeting in the morning to prepare for any problems and we went through evacuation procedures just to protect ourselves and customers,\" he said.

      "body": "<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. I appreciate you being here. I also want to thank Secretary Powell for being here as well. My National Security Advisor, Condi Rice is here, as well as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Myers. I appreciate Admiral Clark and General Ryan here, for being here as well. But most of all, I want to thank you, Admiral Gaffney, and the students for NDU for having me here today.</p> <p>For almost 100 years, this campus has served as one of our country's premier centers for learning and thinking about America's national security. Some of America's finest soldiers have studied here: Dwight Eisenhower and Colin Powell. Some of America's finest statesmen have taught here; George Kennan. Today, you're carrying on this proud tradition forward, continuing to train tomorrow's generals, admirals and other national security thinkers, and continuing to provide the intellectual capital for our nation's strategic vision.</p> <p>This afternoon, I want us to thank back some 30 years to a far different time in a far different world. The United States and the Soviet Union were locked in a hostile rivalry. The Soviet Union was our unquestioned enemy; a highly-armed threat to freedom and democracy. Far more than that wall in Berlin divided us.</p> <p>Our highest ideal was -- and remains -- individual liberty. Theirs was the construction of a vast communist empire. Their totalitarian regime held much of Europe captive behind an iron curtain.</p> <p>We didn't trust them, and for good reason. Our deep differences were expressed in a dangerous military confrontation that resulted in thousands of nuclear weapons pointed at each other on hair-trigger alert. Security of both the United States and the Soviet Union was based on a grim premise: that neither side would fire nuclear weapons at each other, because doing so would mean the end of both nations.</p> <p>We even went so far as to codify this relationship in a 1972 ABM Treaty, based on the doctrine that our very survival would best be insured by leaving both sides completely open and vulnerable to nuclear attack. The threat was real and vivid. The Strategic Air Command had an airborne command post called the Looking Glass, aloft 24 hours a day, ready in case the President ordered our strategic forces to move toward their targets and release their nuclear ordnance.</p> <p>The Soviet Union had almost 1.5 million troops deep in the heart of Europe, in Poland and Czechoslovakia, Hungary and East Germany. We used our nuclear weapons not just to prevent the Soviet Union from using their nuclear weapons, but also to contain their conventional military forces, to prevent them from extending the Iron Curtain into parts of Europe and Asia that were still free.</p> <p>In that world, few other nations had nuclear weapons and most of those who did were responsible allies, such as Britain and France. We worried about the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other countries, but it was mostly a distant threat, not yet a reality.</p> <p>Today, the sun comes up on a vastly different world. The Wall is gone, and so is the Soviet Union. Today's Russia is not yesterday's Soviet Union. Its government is no longer Communist. Its president is elected. Today's Russia is not our enemy, but a country in transition with an opportunity to emerge as a great nation, democratic, at peace with itself and its neighbors. The Iron Curtain no longer exists. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are free nations, and they are now our allies in NATO, together with a reunited Germany.</p> <p>Yet, this is still a dangerous world, a less certain, a less predictable one. More nations have nuclear weapons and still more have nuclear aspirations. Many have chemical and biological weapons. Some already have developed the ballistic missile technology that would allow them to deliver weapons of mass destruction at long distances and at incredible speeds. And a number of these countries are spreading these technologies around the world.</p> <p>Most troubling of all, the list of these countries includes some of the world's least-responsible states. Unlike the Cold War, today's most urgent threat stems not from thousands of ballistic missiles in the Soviet hands, but from a small number of missiles in the hands of these states, states for whom terror and blackmail are a way of life. They seek weapons of mass destruction to intimidate their neighbors, and to keep the United States and other responsible nations from helping allies and friends in strategic parts of the world.</p> <p>When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, the world joined forces to turn him back. But the international community would have faced a very different situation had Hussein been able to blackmail with nuclear weapons. Like Saddam Hussein, some of today's tyrants are gripped by an implacable hatred of the United States of America. They hate our friends, they hate our values, they hate democracy and freedom and individual liberty. Many care little for the lives of their own people. In such a world, Cold War deterrence is no longer enough.</p> <p>To maintain peace, to protect our own citizens and our own allies and friends, we must seek security based on more than the grim premise that we can destroy those who seek to destroy us. This is an important opportunity for the world to re-think the unthinkable, and to find new ways to keep the peace.</p> <p>Today's world requires a new policy, a broad strategy of active nonproliferation, counterproliferation and defenses. We must work together with other like-minded nations to deny weapons of terror from those seeking to acquire them. We must work with allies and friends who wish to join with us to defend against the harm they can inflict. And together we must deter anyone who would contemplate their use.</p> <p>We need new concepts of deterrence that rely on both offensive and defensive forces. Deterrence can no longer be based solely on the threat of nuclear retaliation. Defenses can strengthen deterrence by reducing the incentive for proliferation.</p> <p>We need a new framework that allows us to build missile defenses to counter the different threats of today's world. To do so, we must move beyond the constraints of the 30 year old ABM Treaty. This treaty does not recognize the present, or point us to the future. It enshrines the past. No treaty that prevents us from addressing today's threats, that prohibits us from pursuing promising technology to defend ourselves, our friends and our allies is in our interests or in the interests of world peace.</p> <p>This new framework must encourage still further cuts in nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons still have a vital role to play in our security and that of our allies. We can, and will, change the size, the composition, the character of our nuclear forces in a way that reflects the reality that the Cold War is over.</p> <p>I am committed to achieving a credible deterrent with the lowest-possible number of nuclear weapons consistent with our national security needs, including our obligations to our allies. My goal is to move quickly to reduce nuclear forces. The United States will lead by example to achieve our interests and the interests for peace in the world.</p> <p>Several months ago, I asked Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to examine all available technologies and basing modes for effective missile defenses that could protect the United States, our deployed forces, our friends and our allies. The Secretary has explored a number of complementary and innovative approaches.</p> <p>The Secretary has identified near-term options that could allow us to deploy an initial capability against limited threats. In some cases, we can draw on already established technologies that might involve land-based and sea-based capabilities to intercept missiles in mid-course or after they re-enter the atmosphere. We also recognize the substantial advantages of intercepting missiles early in their flight, especially in the boost phase.</p> <p>The preliminary work has produced some promising options for advanced sensors and interceptors that may provide this capability. If based at sea or on aircraft, such approaches could provide limited, but effective, defenses.</p> <p>We have more work to do to determine the final form the defenses might take. We will explore all these options further. We recognize the technological difficulties we face and we look forward to the challenge. Our nation will assign the best people to this critical task.</p> <p>We will evaluate what works and what does not. We know that some approaches will not work. We also know that we will be able to build on our successes. When ready, and working with Congress, we will deploy missile defenses to strengthen global security and stability.</p> <p>I've made it clear from the very beginning that I would consult closely on the important subject with our friends and allies who are also threatened by missiles and weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>Today, I'm announcing the dispatch of high-level representatives to Allied capitals in Europe, Asia, Australia and Canada to discuss our common responsibility to create a new framework for security and stability that reflects the world of today. They will begin leaving next week.</p> <p>The delegations will be headed by three men on this stage: Rich Armitage, Paul Wolfowitz, and Steve Hadley; Deputies of the State Department, the Defense Department and the National Security staff. Their trips will be part of an ongoing process of consultation, involving many people and many levels of government, including my Cabinet Secretaries.</p> <p>These will be real consultations. We are not presenting our friends and allies with unilateral decisions already made. We look forward to hearing their views, the views of our friends, and to take them into account.</p> <p>We will seek their input on all the issues surrounding the new strategic environment. We'll also need to reach out to other interested states, including China and Russia. Russia and the United States should work together to develop a new foundation for world peace and security in the 21st century. We should leave behind the constraints of an ABM Treaty that perpetuates a relationship based on distrust and mutual vulnerability. This Treaty ignores the fundamental breakthroughs in technology during the last 30 years. It prohibits us from exploring all options for defending against the threats that face us, our allies and other countries.</p> <p>That's why we should work together to replace this Treaty with a new framework that reflects a clear and clean break from the past, and especially from the adversarial legacy of the Cold War. This new cooperative relationship should look to the future, not to the past. It should be reassuring, rather than threatening. It should be premised on openness, mutual confidence and real opportunities for cooperation, including the area of missile defense. It should allow us to share information so that each nation can improve its early warning capability, and its capability to defend its people and territory. And perhaps one day, we can even cooperate in a joint defense.</p> <p>I want to complete the work of changing our relationship from one based on a nuclear balance of terror, to one based on common responsibilities and common interests.

      "bodyText": "Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. I appreciate you being here. I also want to thank Secretary Powell for being here as well. My National Security Advisor, Condi Rice is here, as well as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Myers. I appreciate Admiral Clark and General Ryan here, for being here as well. But most of all, I want to thank you, Admiral Gaffney, and the students for NDU for having me here today. For almost 100 years, this campus has served as one of our country's premier centers for learning and thinking about America's national security. Some of America's finest soldiers have studied here: Dwight Eisenhower and Colin Powell. Some of America's finest statesmen have taught here; George Kennan. Today, you're carrying on this proud tradition forward, continuing to train tomorrow's generals, admirals and other national security thinkers, and continuing to provide the intellectual capital for our nation's strategic vision. This afternoon, I want us to thank back some 30 years to a far different time in a far different world. The United States and the Soviet Union were locked in a hostile rivalry. The Soviet Union was our unquestioned enemy; a highly-armed threat to freedom and democracy. Far more than that wall in Berlin divided us. Our highest ideal was -- and remains -- individual liberty. Theirs was the construction of a vast communist empire. Their totalitarian regime held much of Europe captive behind an iron curtain. We didn't trust them, and for good reason. Our deep differences were expressed in a dangerous military confrontation that resulted in thousands of nuclear weapons pointed at each other on hair-trigger alert. Security of both the United States and the Soviet Union was based on a grim premise: that neither side would fire nuclear weapons at each other, because doing so would mean the end of both nations. We even went so far as to codify this relationship in a 1972 ABM Treaty, based on the doctrine that our very survival would best be insured by leaving both sides completely open and vulnerable to nuclear attack. The threat was real and vivid. The Strategic Air Command had an airborne command post called the Looking Glass, aloft 24 hours a day, ready in case the President ordered our strategic forces to move toward their targets and release their nuclear ordnance. The Soviet Union had almost 1.5 million troops deep in the heart of Europe, in Poland and Czechoslovakia, Hungary and East Germany. We used our nuclear weapons not just to prevent the Soviet Union from using their nuclear weapons, but also to contain their conventional military forces, to prevent them from extending the Iron Curtain into parts of Europe and Asia that were still free. In that world, few other nations had nuclear weapons and most of those who did were responsible allies, such as Britain and France. We worried about the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other countries, but it was mostly a distant threat, not yet a reality. Today, the sun comes up on a vastly different world. The Wall is gone, and so is the Soviet Union. Today's Russia is not yesterday's Soviet Union. Its government is no longer Communist. Its president is elected. Today's Russia is not our enemy, but a country in transition with an opportunity to emerge as a great nation, democratic, at peace with itself and its neighbors. The Iron Curtain no longer exists. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are free nations, and they are now our allies in NATO, together with a reunited Germany. Yet, this is still a dangerous world, a less certain, a less predictable one. More nations have nuclear weapons and still more have nuclear aspirations. Many have chemical and biological weapons. Some already have developed the ballistic missile technology that would allow them to deliver weapons of mass destruction at long distances and at incredible speeds. And a number of these countries are spreading these technologies around the world. Most troubling of all, the list of these countries includes some of the world's least-responsible states. Unlike the Cold War, today's most urgent threat stems not from thousands of ballistic missiles in the Soviet hands, but from a small number of missiles in the hands of these states, states for whom terror and blackmail are a way of life. They seek weapons of mass destruction to intimidate their neighbors, and to keep the United States and other responsible nations from helping allies and friends in strategic parts of the world. When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, the world joined forces to turn him back. But the international community would have faced a very different situation had Hussein been able to blackmail with nuclear weapons. Like Saddam Hussein, some of today's tyrants are gripped by an implacable hatred of the United States of America. They hate our friends, they hate our values, they hate democracy and freedom and individual liberty. Many care little for the lives of their own people. In such a world, Cold War deterrence is no longer enough. To maintain peace, to protect our own citizens and our own allies and friends, we must seek security based on more than the grim premise that we can destroy those who seek to destroy us. This is an important opportunity for the world to re-think the unthinkable, and to find new ways to keep the peace. Today's world requires a new policy, a broad strategy of active nonproliferation, counterproliferation and defenses. We must work together with other like-minded nations to deny weapons of terror from those seeking to acquire them. We must work with allies and friends who wish to join with us to defend against the harm they can inflict. And together we must deter anyone who would contemplate their use. We need new concepts of deterrence that rely on both offensive and defensive forces. Deterrence can no longer be based solely on the threat of nuclear retaliation. Defenses can strengthen deterrence by reducing the incentive for proliferation. We need a new framework that allows us to build missile defenses to counter the different threats of today's world. To do so, we must move beyond the constraints of the 30 year old ABM Treaty. This treaty does not recognize the present, or point us to the future. It enshrines the past. No treaty that prevents us from addressing today's threats, that prohibits us from pursuing promising technology to defend ourselves, our friends and our allies is in our interests or in the interests of world peace. This new framework must encourage still further cuts in nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons still have a vital role to play in our security and that of our allies. We can, and will, change the size, the composition, the character of our nuclear forces in a way that reflects the reality that the Cold War is over. I am committed to achieving a credible deterrent with the lowest-possible number of nuclear weapons consistent with our national security needs, including our obligations to our allies. My goal is to move quickly to reduce nuclear forces. The United States will lead by example to achieve our interests and the interests for peace in the world. Several months ago, I asked Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld to examine all available technologies and basing modes for effective missile defenses that could protect the United States, our deployed forces, our friends and our allies. The Secretary has explored a number of complementary and innovative approaches. The Secretary has identified near-term options that could allow us to deploy an initial capability against limited threats. In some cases, we can draw on already established technologies that might involve land-based and sea-based capabilities to intercept missiles in mid-course or after they re-enter the atmosphere. We also recognize the substantial advantages of intercepting missiles early in their flight, especially in the boost phase. The preliminary work has produced some promising options for advanced sensors and interceptors that may provide this capability. If based at sea or on aircraft, such approaches could provide limited, but effective, defenses. We have more work to do to determine the final form the defenses might take. We will explore all these options further. We recognize the technological difficulties we face and we look forward to the challenge. Our nation will assign the best people to this critical task. We will evaluate what works and what does not. We know that some approaches will not work. We also know that we will be able to build on our successes. When ready, and working with Congress, we will deploy missile defenses to strengthen global security and stability. I've made it clear from the very beginning that I would consult closely on the important subject with our friends and allies who are also threatened by missiles and weapons of mass destruction. Today, I'm announcing the dispatch of high-level representatives to Allied capitals in Europe, Asia, Australia and Canada to discuss our common responsibility to create a new framework for security and stability that reflects the world of today. They will begin leaving next week. The delegations will be headed by three men on this stage: Rich Armitage, Paul Wolfowitz, and Steve Hadley; Deputies of the State Department, the Defense Department and the National Security staff. Their trips will be part of an ongoing process of consultation, involving many people and many levels of government, including my Cabinet Secretaries. These will be real consultations. We are not presenting our friends and allies with unilateral decisions already made. We look forward to hearing their views, the views of our friends, and to take them into account. We will seek their input on all the issues surrounding the new strategic environment. We'll also need to reach out to other interested states, including China and Russia. Russia and the United States should work together to develop a new foundation for world peace and security in the 21st century. We should leave behind the constraints of an ABM Treaty that perpetuates a relationship based on distrust and mutual vulnerability. This Treaty ignores the fundamental breakthroughs in technology during the last 30 years. It prohibits us from exploring all options for defending against the threats that face us, our allies and other countries. That's why we should work together to replace this Treaty with a new framework that reflects a clear and clean break from the past, and especially from the adversarial legacy of the Cold War. This new cooperative relationship should look to the future, not to the past. It should be reassuring, rather than threatening. It should be premised on openness, mutual confidence and real opportunities for cooperation, including the area of missile defense. It should allow us to share information so that each nation can improve its early warning capability, and its capability to defend its people and territory. And perhaps one day, we can even cooperate in a joint defense. I want to complete the work of changing our relationship from one based on a nuclear balance of terror, to one based on common responsibilities and common interests. We may have areas of difference with Russia, but we are not and must not be strategic adversaries. Russia and America both face new threats to security. Together, we can address today's threats and pursue today's opportunities. We can explore technologies that have the potential to make us all safer. This is a time for vision; a time for a new way of thinking; a time for bold leadership. The Looking Glass no longer stands its 24-hour-day vigil. We must all look at the world in a new, realistic way, to preserve peace for generations to come. God bless.",

The pan-European football game, called Keep It Up, is a first for Ford. It has been launched across Europe on UK, German, Spanish, Italian and French sites belonging to Sportal, the sports information provider. The game was the brainchild of the online marketing specialist, Tangozebra. Tangozebra also implemented an innovative internet advertising campaign, called \"destination football\", which was created by Bruce Dunlop Associates. The adverts have been billed as the web's first TV-style online sponsorship. It is hoped Keep It Up will capture the imagination of football fans across Europe in the run-up to the Champions League final on May 23. The game allows users to control a football player by moving the cursor keys to keep the ball off the ground. The arrow keys are used to kick the ball, move the player left and right or to perform special moves, which score extra points. The game can be forwarded to friends - providing the viral aspect of the game - and scores can be registered. This will enable Ford to capture users' names and email addresses for future use. Registering scores will also allow a league table of the top 100 scorers across Europe to be published. Useful link Click here to see some of Ford's online adverts",

Hundreds of GPs shut up shop in protest at overwork, bureaucracy and other gripes. Meanwhile the BMA is balloting GPs to resign from the NHS if they don't get everything they want - the result designed to embarrass the government days before the election. </p> <p>The BMA says its members are working harder than ever, taking over chronically ill patients from hospital outpatient departments, looking after people leaving hospital sicker, filling in more forms, shouldering a bigger burden in running the NHS - all of which is undoubtedly true. \"Morale has never been lower,\" says the BMA, (but then NHS morale always is at the rock-bottom, along with teachers, BBC staff or anyone else asked by their unions). </p> <p>However, alongside teachers, doctors top the poll in public trust, with 84% saying they do their job well. Most GPs work hard with great dedication, especially those in over-stretched inner-city practices where doctors are hard to recruit and patients need most care. But while there are plenty of idealistic, energetic GPs, as in all occupations, there are the other kind too - running practices with too many patients to clock up fat capitation fees, not delivering good enough care. Alan Maynard, professor of health economics at York University, says due to its private status, general practice is a data free zone, with no in formation on what GPs are prescribing drugs for, huge variations in prescribing and no outcome measurements. Until now GPs have not been appraised, while working to very vague contracts. </p> <p>The virulence of this GP protest is odd. Doctor magazine, which called yesterday's strike, is in cut-throat competition with other drug advertising financed weeklies vying for GPs' fleeting attention with ever more lurid stories of an NHS in terminal collapse, doctors exploited in a life of medical hell. Their own survey claimed 90% of GPs \"stressed\", with eight out of 10 saying they would not recommend anyone to join their profession. The BMA is calling on GPs to \"work to rule\", with disgraceful actions for a responsible profession. They include: obstructing the NHS by referring more patients to hospital for minor treatments, calling out more ambulances, sending patients to other parts of the NHS or to the benefits agency medical service for second opinions. </p> <p>It asks GPs to give \"maximum publicity to health service failures or deficiencies\", assuring them, \"We have been advised that GPs taking these actions would not be in breach of their terms of service\". The BMA leopard never changes its spots. It always opposes all change, including opposition to the NHS itself in 1948. From Bevan to Castle, to an assault upon the mostly sensible Thatcher/Clarke reforms, the BMA is short-sighted and grasping, but dismally predictable with its veneer of concern for patients thinly covering sectional interests. </p> <p>Most GPs remain small businessmen, independent contractors, a concession forced on Bevan when he famously \"stuffed their mouths with gold\" to get them into the NHS at all. Mouth-stuffing has remained at the heart of their contractual relationship ever since. Every new treatment requires more money in their pockets for doing it - from diabetic care to contraception, flu jabs to infant inoculation. When they complain about paperwork and bureaucracy, the overwhelming majority of it is the bits of paper chasing their items of service, which make up the largest slab of their pay. One of their duties is to undertake 30 hours training a year: their most popular course is accountancy. </p> <p>How much worse is their workload? The curiosity of this outburst is its timing. For the first time in doctors' memories things look set to get much better in the NHS - and for GPs especially. Indeed, when the leader of the BMA heard the chancellor's 2000 budget speech, with its biggest ever real 6.1% a year increase for four years, he tore up his usual sour press release and wrote remarkably, \"We are delighted\". At least 2,000 more GPs are promised: the number in training, which dropped 16% between 1990-1996, has now increased by 9%, with more promised. What's more, the GPs are the focus of power in the new NHS Plan: grouped in primary care trusts, they will soon control 75% of the NHS budget. No longer the neglected corner of the system, they will be its key purchasers. For too long the big money was syphoned off into hospital waiting lists, but this should push money back into community and preventative care, where some 95% of treatment is carried out. </p> <p>By no means all GPs support the BMA and Doctor magazine's intemperate behaviour. Dr Tim Winch, chair of the primary care group in Kent Weald, formerly from an inner-city practice, is appalled and the BMA's obstruction of reform of GP practices. Calling for nationalisation of the whole GP service, his pithy press release dismisses GP leaders as \"mass whingers\". He thinks GPs do well with a minimum income of some \u00a356,000 - many earning closer to \u00a380,000 (or more) with extra payments for looking after local old peoples homes or myriad other paid jobs, plus good expenses. </p> <p>It is odd that GPs are protesting about stress now, when their working hours have become more civilised. Since 1995 GPs rarely have to drag themselves out of bed at night, with locums doing night calls instead. Daytime home visits by GPs have halved during the last decade. Dr Winch thinks GPs just don't realise how much harder everyone else works these days: their grumbling puts off new recruits to a decent profession with reasonable hours. The red book, which prescribes GPs work, requires only 4.5 days a week, 26 hours a week face-to-face with patients (which includes home visits), and nothing much else fixed. It is unclear why most surgeries have no evening or weekend sessions, when their patients work long hours, too. Official figures show the number of consultations GPs conduct a year has dropped slightly over the last 20 years, not risen as the BMA claims - though their patients are older and sicker. However, GPs do have many more nurses and other support now. </p> <p>Agreeing a good new GP contract is vital for the success of the NHS Plan. GPs do need appraisals and greater quality control. However, the government's passion for performance indicators can lead to bizarre outcomes, distorting what people do to hit paper targets: they need to listen to what GPs say. But it is hard to listen patiently to hectoring BMA leaders who adopt such extreme and unwarranted tactics. A balance has to be struck between trusting GPs as respected, well-resourced professionals, while insisting on more scrutiny of what they do. Observers despair at the BMA's brutish ham-fisted behaviour. If GPs want a good contract that works well, their leaders' aggressive posturing makes it less likely.</p>",

Those at their desks were more interested in tracking the progress of the protesters than trying to drum up any business. </p> <p>But behind the scenes some brokers were frantically working on one of the biggest share placings the London market has seen. The select few were locked on to <strong> Vodafone </strong> , its most liquid stock. </p> <p>Word had spread by late afternoon that one of Vodafone's financial advisers, either Goldman Sachs or UBS Warburg, will today attempt to place more than \u00a33bn of new Vodafone stock with City institutions.The shares, which accounted for 15% of trading yesterday, fell 6p to 206.25p. </p> <p>It is understood Vodafone will put the cash towards the acquisition, announced yesterday, of <strong> BT's </strong> holdings in Japan Telecom and Airtel, the Spanish mobile phone company. </p> <p>BT finished 47p higher at 599p - the best blue chip performer - as the market welcomed the first serious attempt to tackle its debt. Dealers expect the shares to come under heavy selling pressure today. The size of the Vodafone offering means institutions will have little appetite for the \u00a35bn rights issue BT is plotting. </p> <p>The FTSE TechMark 100 fell 19.74 points to 2.080.68, with investors booking recent gains in the likes of <strong> Autonomy </strong> , down 61p to 530p and optical components maker <strong> Bookham Technology </strong> , off 18p to 341.5p. </p> <p>Back among the leaders, ITV company <strong> Carlton Communications</strong> advanced 7p to 434p after Dresnder Kleinwort Wassertein initiated coverage with a \"buy\" recommendation, while <strong> Lattice </strong> , up 5.5p to 136p, bounced back from Monday's drubbing courtesy a strong push from JP Morgan. </p> <p>The retail sector had a tough day as investors digested the latest gossip from the industry. Retail analysts say sales in the past two weeks have been poor as shoppers stay at home because of wet weather. </p> <p> <strong> Marks &amp; Spencer </strong> , down 4p to 264p yesterday, is said to have been hit hard by the trend, with womenswear sales falling 12% and homeware 14%. <strong> Debenhams</strong> is thought to have experienced sluggish sales growth. It finished down 25p at 415p, one of the worst performers in the FTSE 250. </p> <p>By contrast <strong> PowderJect</strong> was one of the best, rising 27p to 436p after positive noises from Goldman Sachs. The US bro ker feels the share price does not reflect the change in the company's focus from a drug delivery company to a vaccines specialist with drug delivery capabilities. </p> <p>Goldman believes events in the coming year will offer the company a chance to rebuild its tarnished reputation. In the meantime it has upgraded its stance on the stock to \"market outperform\" and set a 720p target price. </p> <p>Among the small caps, <strong> QXL Ricardo</strong> moved up 1p to 6.75p in heavy trade on talk that the internet auction house has been approached by US rival, Ebay. Dealers thought the tale plausible. Although Ebay is the dominant force in the industry it lacks critical mass in Europe. Buying QXL would be a relatively painless way of solving that problem. </p> <p>Elsewhere, <strong> Redstone Telecom</strong> dropped 7.5p to 52p on rumours that the company is in refinancing talks. Sector specialists poured scorn on the story pointing to comments made by the company at the time of third-quarter results in February. Redstone said it anticipated being able to move to a cash positive position without the need for further financing.</p>",

Back among the leaders, ITV company Carlton Communications advanced 7p to 434p after Dresnder Kleinwort Wassertein initiated coverage with a \"buy\" recommendation, while Lattice , up 5.5p to 136p, bounced back from Monday's drubbing courtesy a strong push from JP Morgan. The retail sector had a tough day as investors digested the latest gossip from the industry. Retail analysts say sales in the past two weeks have been poor as shoppers stay at home because of wet weather. Marks &amp; Spencer , down 4p to 264p yesterday, is said to have been hit hard by the trend, with womenswear sales falling 12% and homeware 14%. Debenhams is thought to have experienced sluggish sales growth. It finished down 25p at 415p, one of the worst performers in the FTSE 250. By contrast PowderJect was one of the best, rising 27p to 436p after positive noises from Goldman Sachs. The US bro ker feels the share price does not reflect the change in the company's focus from a drug delivery company to a vaccines specialist with drug delivery capabilities. Goldman believes events in the coming year will offer the company a chance to rebuild its tarnished reputation. In the meantime it has upgraded its stance on the stock to \"market outperform\" and set a 720p target price. Among the small caps, QXL Ricardo moved up 1p to 6.75p in heavy trade on talk that the internet auction house has been approached by US rival, Ebay. Dealers thought the tale plausible. Although Ebay is the dominant force in the industry it lacks critical mass in Europe. Buying QXL would be a relatively painless way of solving that problem. Elsewhere, Redstone Telecom dropped 7.5p to 52p on rumours that the company is in refinancing talks. Sector specialists poured scorn on the story pointing to comments made by the company at the time of third-quarter results in February. Redstone said it anticipated being able to move to a cash positive position without the need for further financing.",

      "bodyText": "Advertising group True North Communications has warned that organic growth will be lower than expected this year owing to the downturn in the advertising market. The company, which is being taken over by advertising giant Interpublic, said its original forecast of 8% growth had been overly ambitious. It said organic growth, which excludes the effects of acquisitions and currency fluctuations, would reach just 5% in 2001. Kevin Smith, True North's chief financial officer, said the company had started to feel the effects of the advertising slowdown in March. The slowdown has already begun to hit US advertising agencies hard, with many having to make redundancies. True North's announcement follows disappointing first quarter results from WPP last week.

      "bodyText": "Why should journalists suspend their normal cynicism about self-promotion and get involved in World Press Freedom Day? And why should the public understand that not all journalism is about tabloid scoops and competing for exclusive interviews with yet another Big Brother contestant? At the latest count by the World Association of Newspapers, 52 journalists were killed or murdered in 26 countries in 2000. Another 71 journalists are being held in prison. What jumps out from careful scrutiny of these chilling statistics is the fact nearly all of the casualties are local journalists who have been targeted by governments and regimes for what they have written or reported. But how much coverage do these murders and attacks get in the international press? When Marie Colvin of the Sunday Times - whose courageous reporting around the world is an inspiration to all journalists - was nearly killed in Sri Lanka, there was, quite rightly, major news coverage, especially in the British press. Yet after the BBC's local correspondent in Jaffna, Mylvaganam Nimalarajan, was shot dead in his home while working on a BBC report, there was not a single news story in the British press about his death. Beyond reporting attacks on journalists everywhere they occur, newspapers and broadcasters must also help local journalists in other ways. First, they should take better care of their own local stringers, translators and fixers. They have a moral and financial responsibility to do so. Next, editors and news executives should use their publications and airwaves to condemn attacks on local journalists. They should also write strongly worded letters of protest to leaders of governments that feel they have impunity when it comes to harming local journalists. Recently, the Paris-based Reporters Sans Frontieres, announced it was creating what it calls a \"Damocles network\" that will launch more intensive investigations of the murders of local journalists. RSF's general secretary, Robert Menard, told a Freedom Forum gathering: \"These torturers and murderers of journalists will realise one day they will be brought to account and they will think twice before they torture and kill journalists in future.\" For now, journalists who pursue stories that are critical of their governments and refuse to be intimidated remain at great risk. It humbles all journalists who work in privileged countries to see how defiantly brave are journalists of the calibre of Anna Politkovskaya of Russia's Novaya Gazeta newspaper and Mark Chavunduka, the editor of the Zimbabwe Standard. Ms Politkovskaya continues to defy Russian restraints on reporting inside Chechnya, returning time and again to dramatise the plight of the Chechnyan refugees. She has done so even though, on an earlier assignment, she was nearly raped and murdered. She simply will not give up the Chechnyan story. Nor will Zimbabwe journalists like Mr Chavunduka stop reporting the opposition to President Robert Mugabe. Mr Chavunduka has every reason to fear for his life. After reporting a failed coup attempt against the president, Mr Chavunduka and reporter Ray Choto were tortured so badly they required a long stay at London's Medical Foundation for Torture Victims. So on this World Press Freedom Day, count your journalistic blessings and stop by the Freedom Forum to pay tribute to Ms Politkovskaya and Mr Chavunduka. \u0095 John Owen is the director of the Freedom Forum, European sector MediaGuardian.co.uk special report World press freedom day",

Mr Jackson described ITV2 as an example of what happens when a broadcaster \"doesn't do a new channel properly, doesn't invest properly\". \"That possibly damages your brand, it isn't effective and you don't learn anything for the future,\" he added. Mr Jackson contrasted ITV2 with Channel 4's FilmFour and E4 services. \"Unlike some of our commercial rivals, in the past year or two we have become a leader in new digital channels,\" he said. He also promised Channel 4 would not join the current rush by publicly listed companies to cut back their internet operations. \"We're not going to do what a lot of shareholder based companies have done and draw in our horns because it's not fashionable. We are in an investment phase,\" he said. The Channel 4 accounts for 2000, published yesterday, revealed the broadcaster's operating profit fell by 25% last year as it stepped up its investment in new commercial ventures, such as websites and digital TV channels.

Last week she travelled deep into Chechnya to investigate reports of torture, rape and detention camps run by the Russian army. If there were any doubts about the veracity of the shocking stories she heard, they vanished when she was herself detained by Russian troops. The journalist had turned victim. Yesterday an inquiry was launched as 30 bodies were found in a mass grave outside Grozny",

      "body": "<p>This article was first published in the Guardian on February 27 2001.<br> It all began when 90 families living in several villages in the Vedeno district of southern Chechnya brought their collective complaint to our editorial office. The text was unprecedented: several hundred people were asking to be helped to to move out of Chechnya to any place in Russia, as soon as possible. The reasons: constant hunger, unbearable cold, total isolation from the outside world, lack of medical care - and a special complaint about brutal punitive raids on their villages by the federal forces stationed on the outskirts of the village of Khottuni. </p> <p>The facts were as fantastic as they were glaring. So they had to be verified on the spot. The visit began on February 18. I heard dozens of harrowing accounts from people who had been exposed to torture and maltreatment by Russian troops: stories so horrific that one's hand refused to jot them down.</p> <p>And then I experienced at first hand events in which I myself was the victim. It is as if pictures had come to life to confirm the accounts I had heard. Now the person to whom they shouted: \"Stop! Get a move on!\" was myself. And an official of the FSB - the successor to the KGB - a first lieutenant of tender age, whispered dirty insults in my ear: \"You are one of them ... You should be shot ...\"</p> <p>One of the first accounts of torture was given to me by Rozita from the village of Tovzeni. She can barely move her lips, her eyes have a vacuous expression, and she still walks with difficulty. Her feet and kidneys ache.</p> <p>A month ago Rozita was brought to what she called a filtration camp for \"sheltering militants\". It was a real concentration camp, run on a commercial basis, on the outskirts of the village of Khottuni, in the Vedeno district, where the Russian 45th Airborne Regiment and 119th Paratroop Regiment are stationed.</p> <p>Rozita is no longer young. She has many children and several grandchildren. The youngest of them is three and previously spoke no Russian, but having seen how her grandmother was detained, now constantly shouts: \"Lie down on the floor.\" Rozita was arrested in her home at dawn when everybody was asleep. They took her completely by surprise and they did not let her to pack her things properly. She was thrown into a pit in the grounds of the camp outside Khottuni.</p> <p>\"Did they push you? Did they kick you?\" Yes, that's the usual thing.\" Rozita spent 12 days in the pit. The soldier who guarded it took pity on her one night and threw her a piece of rug. \"I curled up on it. The soldier is a human being after all,\" she said. The pit was shallow - 1.20 metres (4ft) - and arranged so that the occupant seemed to be in cold mountain air in winter, with no roof overhead, but was unable to stand up because of massive logs across the top which could not be dislodged with the head. So she spent 12 days squatting or sitting on the piece of rug.</p> <p>Rozita never learned whom she had \"sheltered\". No charges were ever brought against her, although she was interrogated three times.</p> <p>Officers young enough to be her sons introduced themselves as FSB people. They put \"children's mittens\" on her. That means that she had one end of a live wire attached to the fingers of one hand and the other end to the fingers of the other hand. And the wires were slung across the back of her neck.</p> <p>\"Yes, I screamed something terrible,\" she said. \"It hurt a lot when they turned on the current. But I didn't scream otherwise. I was afraid to provoke them. The FSB people said: 'You aren't dancing well enough. Let's add some more voltage.' And so they did.\" And Rozita screamed louder and louder.</p> <p>\"Why did they torture you? Did you know?\" \"No. They didn't ask any specific questions\". Meanwhile the officers told Rozita's relatives through go-betweens that they had better raise money for a ransom. They were told to hurry up because Rozita was not enduring her stay in the pit very well and she might not last too long. After a while the money was brought and Rozita, filthy and unkempt, shuffled toward the regimental checkpoint and her freedom. So, who is granny Rozita from Tovzeni? A militant? If not, why was she detained? If so, why was she released?</p> <p>The commander of the 45th Regiment is an attractive-looking, strong-willed man. A colonel who has seen action in Afghanistan and Chechnya. He curses the war, thinks aloud about his children, who are growing up without a father and, if he had his way, would like to end the Chechen war at once. He has had enough.</p> <p>He is taking me on a guided tour of the grounds of the regiment's garrison in Khottuni, where Rozita was held. Eventually we come to the most essential place. He shows me the pits into which Chechens are thrown after the mopping up operations. He is considerate and he holds my elbow lest I fall into a six-metre hole in the ground.</p> <p>The pit looks exactly as it was described by the numerous people who have been in it. It measures three by three metres. There is a stench coming from the pit, despite the winter frost. The Chechens are meant to urinate and defecate in the pit. And they spend day and night standing. They have a choice of sitting down.</p> <p>The commander appears to be very uneasy about what is happening, and he tells me some surprising things. One day a general flew in to inspect the regiment. He saw the detained Chechens standing in the field and ordered them to be kept in the pits, originally dug for dumping rubbish in. The colonel sounds sincere when he says: \"But we put only the rebels there. Not ordinary people.\"</p> <p>Then there is the account of Isa, who lives in Selmentauzen, also in the Vedeno area of southern Chechnya. He was brought to the camp in early February. They stubbed out cigarettes on his body, they pulled out his nails, and beat him over the kidneys with Pepsi Cola bottles filled with water. Then they threw him down into a pit called the \"bathtub\". It was filled with water. After throwing in the Chechens, they threw in smoke sticks. Isa survived. Not all did.</p> <p>Isa shared the pit with five other men. The junior officers who interrogated them told them that they had nice butts, and raped them. And they added as an excuse: \"Your women wouldn't let us fuck them.\"</p> <p>These Chechens now say they will spend the rest of their lives taking revenge for \"nice butts\". Isa never quite recovered from the shock. Like Rozita, he was later released for a ransom raised by his whole village.</p> <p>Experiences like those of Isa and Rozita show that the Chechen war has reversed the roles of victims and tormentors. The declared target of the \"counter-terrorist operation\" - rampant hostage-taking, slavery and ransoms - is now the business engaged in by the military.</p> <p>Two minutes after I said goodbye to the commander, I was detained. First they made me stand in the middle of a rutted field for more than an hour. Then an armoured vehicle with armed fighters led by a first lieutenant arrived. Their identities were unknown. They seized me, pushed me with their rifle butts, and took me away.</p> <p>\"Your papers are false, you are one of them [the Chechen rebels],\" I was told. Then followed interrogations for hours on end. Young officers reminded me pointedly that they were from the FSB and that they took their orders only from President Putin himself. They made it clear to me that freedom was over.</p> <p>I omit the most disgusting details of the interrogations, because they are utterly obscene. But it is these details - and my tormentors couldn't have imagined it - that provided the key proof that everything the Chechens had earlier told me about tortures and man-handling was true. From time to time the zealous young officers were joined by a senior officer, a lieutenant-colonel with a swarthy face and dark, stupid, bulging eyes. Every now and then he sent the youngsters out of the tent, switched on what he thought to be romantic music and hinted that if I behaved right I could count on a \"favourable outcome\".</p> <p>In the intervals between his appearances, the \"youngsters\" did a competent job touching upon the most sensitive spots: looking at the pictures of my children they did not forget to tell me what they would do to them. It lasted more than three hours.</p> <p>Eventually the lieutenant-colonel, who tried to arouse my sympathy by saying that he was spilling his blood for nothing, looked at his watch and said: \"Let's go, I'll shoot you.\" He took me out of the tent. It was pitch dark.</p> <p>We walked a short distance and then the colonel said: \"Ready or not, here I come.\" Suddenly there was a terrible racket, screeching and flames. The lieutenant-colonel seemed to be gratified that I had bent down from horror. It turned out that he had brought me right up to the Grad mortar at the time it was fired.</p> <p>\"Come on.\" Before long, we came to another flight of steps. \"This is a bathhouse. Take off your clothes.\" When he realised I was not going to oblige, he grew very angry. He kept saying: \"A lieutenant-colonel wants you with all his heart and you, wretched bitch.\" And he added: \"Remember? Ready or not, here I come.\" Another officer, who said he was from the FSB, barged into the bathhouse. The lieutenant-colonel drew the line: \"She doesn't want to take a bath\".</p> <p>The FSB man put the bottles on the table and said: \"Then I'll take her.\" We circled for a long time through the darkness. Finally he again ordered me to climb down the stairs. It was the bunker which was to become my refuge until I was released in the afternoon of February 22.</p> <p>On the wall was a poster: \"119th Paratroop Regiment\". The captions underneath informed you that 18 of its servicemen were holders of the title Hero of Russia. I demanded to be charged. Or that I should be sent to jail, where my relatives could visit me. \"No way! You are one of the bandits! If you worked for us, you would get everything. But you came here to look at the pits. You are a bitch ...\"</p> <p>The nightmare ended with a flight out of Chechnya to Mozdok, in southern Russia, and from there back to Moscow. On the way back, all the isolated stories I had heard, all the episodes of my trip, clicked into one whole. That's when I drew the final conclusion.</p> <p>All this is happening in our country, here, now. Under the existing constitution. Under a \"strong-willed\" president who is its guarantor. With the prosecutor general's office still functioning. With human rights activists, both government and independent, working to ensure people's rights.</p> <p>And still, despite all that, there are the pits, the \"children's mittens\", the \"dancing\", \"ready or not, here I come\".

The UK telecoms group today said it had sold its 20% stakes in Japan Telecom and J-Phone for \u00a33.7bn, and its 17.8% holding in Spanish mobile phone group Airtel for \u00a31.1bn.

BT's shares rose 1% in early trading after the group made most of its gains from an anticipated deal yesterday, while Vodafone's stock fell 4% as the market reacted to yet another cash call from the debt-ridden telecoms sector. The move will enable Vodafone to increase its stake in Japan Telecom to 45 percent from 25%. \"Vodafone is extremely excited about strengthening its presence in Japan,\" Chris Gent, the Vodafone chief executive, told a news conference. The deal highlights Vodafone's drive to take a leading role in the development of third generation mobile technology, which will be able to offer video and music on handheld phones, taking on industry innovator and Japanese giant NTT DoCoMo.

Mr Liddiment will give the MacTaggart speech, which has been used in the past as a platform to set out a vision for television's future and deliver broadsides against rivals within the industry, at the Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival in late August. He is planning to tackle the \"challenge of sustaining creativity and innovation in television as the market becomes more complex and competition increases\". The speech will be delivered on Friday August 24 and Mr Liddiment will take questions about it at a TV festival session the following day. Previous MacTaggart speakers have included Dennis Potter, who famously derided then BBC director general Sir John Birt as a \"croak-voiced dalek in an Armani suit\"; and Rupert Murdoch, who in 1989 railed against what he argued was the \"narrow elite\" running British TV.

      "body": "<p>The signal for yesterday's May Day madness - the mobilisation of 10,000 police to corral a few thousand anti-capitalist protesters, plus a handful of headbangers - was given by the prime minister almost a year ago. By any objective reckoning, the televised trashing of McDonald's and daubing of a Winston Churchill statue last time round scarcely amounted to an orgy of street violence. But Tony Blair was adamant. \"This kind of thing cannot happen again,\" he declared, as jail sentences were handed down for crimes such as throwing a plastic bottle, painting slogans and threatening behaviour.</p> <p>This year, the Met have got the message. In an orchestrated climate of absurdist and self-fulfilling hysteria about the threat of \"atrocities\" from US-trained anarchists, public opinion was duly softened up for yesterday's New Labour police operation, complete with terrifying mugshots of alleged rioters, excitable talk about rubber bullets and mutterings about the Real IRA using the demonstrations as cover for a new bomb attack.</p> <p>Fresh from his hostile reception at Sunday's South African Freedom Day concert, Blair was at it again on Monday, accusing protesters of planning to inflict \"fear, terror, violence\", while Jack Straw denounced the \"evil people\" behind last year's ruck. No doubt being seen to crack down hard on an apparently unpopular target looks like a sensible move in the runup to an election in which Labour will be attacked for its record on crime. But by dismissing the ideas behind yesterday's demonstrations as a \"spurious cause\", the prime minister made clear he does not simply want to demonise riotous protest, but the increasingly influential anti-corporate movement that has fuelled them.</p> <p>It is, of course, much easier to shock the bourgeoisie than to overthrow it, as the historian Eric Hobsbawm put it. And while a few \"hardcore\" anti-capitalists appear to have succeeded in shocking the powers-that-be - or at least cabinet ministers and the tabloid press - they can hardly imagine that throwing stones at the police or smashing shop windows is going to shake the capitalist order. The only political violence that has ever achieved its aims has either been spontaneous or decisive - anything else merely tends to weaken the cause of those carrying it out.

      "bodyText": "The signal for yesterday's May Day madness - the mobilisation of 10,000 police to corral a few thousand anti-capitalist protesters, plus a handful of headbangers - was given by the prime minister almost a year ago. By any objective reckoning, the televised trashing of McDonald's and daubing of a Winston Churchill statue last time round scarcely amounted to an orgy of street violence. But Tony Blair was adamant. \"This kind of thing cannot happen again,\" he declared, as jail sentences were handed down for crimes such as throwing a plastic bottle, painting slogans and threatening behaviour. This year, the Met have got the message. In an orchestrated climate of absurdist and self-fulfilling hysteria about the threat of \"atrocities\" from US-trained anarchists, public opinion was duly softened up for yesterday's New Labour police operation, complete with terrifying mugshots of alleged rioters, excitable talk about rubber bullets and mutterings about the Real IRA using the demonstrations as cover for a new bomb attack. Fresh from his hostile reception at Sunday's South African Freedom Day concert, Blair was at it again on Monday, accusing protesters of planning to inflict \"fear, terror, violence\", while Jack Straw denounced the \"evil people\" behind last year's ruck. No doubt being seen to crack down hard on an apparently unpopular target looks like a sensible move in the runup to an election in which Labour will be attacked for its record on crime. But by dismissing the ideas behind yesterday's demonstrations as a \"spurious cause\", the prime minister made clear he does not simply want to demonise riotous protest, but the increasingly influential anti-corporate movement that has fuelled them. It is, of course, much easier to shock the bourgeoisie than to overthrow it, as the historian Eric Hobsbawm put it. And while a few \"hardcore\" anti-capitalists appear to have succeeded in shocking the powers-that-be - or at least cabinet ministers and the tabloid press - they can hardly imagine that throwing stones at the police or smashing shop windows is going to shake the capitalist order. The only political violence that has ever achieved its aims has either been spontaneous or decisive - anything else merely tends to weaken the cause of those carrying it out. Groups that want a bar ney with the police have always attached themselves to large-scale demonstrations - whether against the Vietnam war, poll tax or apartheid - and the the anti-corporate protests are more than usually vulnerable to such diversions because of their highly decentralised, ultra-democratic forms of organisations. But far more significant in the longer run than apportioning blame for yesterday's clashes is the fact that 10 years after the end of the cold war and the supposed global triumph of liberal capitalist ideas, the international workers' day has again become a focus of international protest, animated yesterday by a common political agenda from London to Sydney, Moscow to Seoul: rejection of neo-liberal globalisation, opposition to the eclipse of democracy by corporate power and demand for international action to tackle the ecological crisis.

The address had been circulated in internet whispers, naming this semi-derelict factory in Southwark in south London as the \"convergence centre\" - meeting point for the protestors who would wreak May Day havoc in the capital.</p> <p>Sure enough, there was an unmarked police car outside, an officer filming every arrival and departure with a hand-held video camera. But inside, the night before May Day, was a disappointment. Not several hundred activists gathering on the eve of revolution, but half a dozen post-teenage boys in woolly balaclavas mooching around in what looked like a crack house. There was plenty of spirited graffiti on the walls - \"Dance on the ruins of capitalism\" - but not much action. Not much talk either. \"No journalists\" was the line: \"We're not interested in writing, we want to get to the heart of the matter.\"</p> <p>For a movement with such disdain for communication, the \"anti-capitalist resistance\" has proved remarkably effective. What was once a wacky, fringe belief - that corporate power is out of control - is gradually entering the mainstream. These days, even big-league politicians admit their powerlessness in the face of major companies. The honest ones concede that the fate of the environment or workers' rights are now determined more in the boardroom than the parliamentary chamber. The argument is slowly being won: in an era when Motorola can ignore the pleas of a British prime minister, and close down a factory with barely a second thought, it is hard to oppose it.</p> <p>The problem, as always, is what to do about it. Violence doesn't work; even peaceful protest brings diminishing returns. For anyone who opposes the onward march of capital - with its knack for ravaging the planet and ripping off its people - the question is clear. What should we do?</p> <p>The last few days have provided a clue, not in yesterday's stand-off, but at a quieter, less heralded confrontation a week earlier. It took place not in a rundown squat nor in Oxford Street, but in the main auditorium of the Barbican - venue of the annual general meeting of CGNU, the insurance giant which grew from the old Norwich Union.</p> <p>Lined up on stage, politburo-style, was the board of 16 directors. Facing them were CGNU's shareholders, representatives of big financial houses but also private individuals with just a share or two to their name. The chairman, Pehr Gyllenhammar, gave his annual report and then asked for questions from the floor.</p> <p>The first came from a representative of the South African National Union of Mineworkers, who reported that 60 people from his community back home had died from illnesses linked to asbestos. He wanted to ask about Norwich Union's 2% share in Cape plc, which used to mine asbestos in South Africa during the apartheid era and which is involved in a legal battle over compensation for 3,000 workers who, campaigners say, were poisoned in the process. \"I ask the chairman to give a one minute silence for those who died before ever receiving justice,\" said the man from the NUM.</p> <p>The chairman, peering down from his lofty perch on the platform, said there were lots of causes he sympathised with but he couldn't give a minute's silence for all of them. Next question? A second representative of the South African miners. Gyllenhammar shifts in his seat and repeats his earlier statement. Next? The director of Action for South Africa steps forward to say he's heard enough words from CGNU and wants some real pressure on Cape. \"We are getting on with our normal business,\" says the chairman stiffly. He wants another question and beckons a white man in a suit to come forward. Except he's an official of the GMB union and he, too, asks about asbestos. CGNU press officers are writhing in their seats with embarrassment: their day has been hijacked.</p> <p>It may not look like the May Day Monopoly carnival, but this clash is also an assault on global capitalism. The union officials may not have green hair; the Action for South Africa campaigners did not abseil into the Barbican but walked through the front entrance. Yet their challenge poses an equal - perhaps even greater - threat.</p> <p>F or they are playing capitalism at its own game. They were in the meeting, rather than demonstrating outside it, because they have bought shares in CGNU. Greenpeace played the same game at BP's get-together last month, tabling motions against the continued extraction of fossil fuels (apparently at odds with the company's promise to go \"beyond petroleum\") and its links with a Chinese firm now building a pipeline across Tibet. Company rules allow shareholder challenges - and these campaigners are playing the rules for all their worth.</p> <p>The result is unexpected proof of the migration of politics from Westminster to big business. For the CGNU debate proved a far livelier event than the average session at Labour party conference. All the old favourites were there: challenges to the chair, points of order, accusations against the leadership. It was enough to make you nostalgic. What's more, it's made possible by a classic exercise in Militant-style entryism - with Greenpeace and co infiltrating BP rather than the Labour party. They're no fools; they've gone where the power is.</p> <p>Could this be the next wave for the movement against capitalism, with activists trading their nose-studs for share portfolios? Noreena Hertz - whose incisive new book, The Silent Takeover, lays bare the coup big business has staged against democracy - cites \"shareholder activism,\" along with consumer action, as an immediately available weapon in the new war. She lights upon Sister Pa tricia Marshall, an American nun who has teamed up with churches and synagogues to form the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility. Their combined assets amount to $110bn, which the nuns and rabbis invest in target companies they hope to influence. So far Sister Patricia has persuaded Pepsi to pull out of Burma and Kimberley Clark, makers of Kleenex, to sell off its tobacco operations. Brent Blackwelder, the president of Friends of the Earth, tells Hertz: \"Corporations often ignore stakeholders, but they listen to shareholders.\"</p> <p>Of course there are limits. Greenpeace cannot afford the number of shares it would need to get BP policy changed. It has to rely on embarrassment power instead. Nor do pressure groups always know what corporations are up to; plenty of companies keep their most unattractive activities in the dark.</p> <p>What would help is full disclosure, with companies forced to lay their affairs out in the open. But that takes laws, and they require governments prepared to pass them - even in the teeth of fierce corporate opposition. No government dares take on big business alone - for fear the big firms will simply pull out, moving factories and jobs somewhere more hospitable - but if governments worked together they surely would be strong enough. The World Trade Organisation, instead of being a tool of the corporations, could be a weapon against them. Either way, we are all having to face up to a tough truth. Hurling rocks will not be enough; shareholder rebellions may only be a good start. This threat is global and serious - and so must be our response.<br> <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com</a><br><br><b>The London May Day protests at a glance</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481318,00.html\">Minute-by-minute coverage of the demonstrations</a></p> <p><b>Audio reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/audio2001/0501vidal.ra\">John Vidal witnesses a party atmosphere outside McDonald's in King's Cross, London (1min 45)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/audio2001/0501left.ra\">Sarah Left on the Critical Mass cycle ride (2mins)</a></p> <p><b>Caption competition</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/graphic/0,7367,481420,00.html\">Send us a caption for this May Day picture and win a prize</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481481,00.html \">01.05.2001: May Day could cost millions</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481319,00.html\">01.05.2001: May Day protests grip London</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481407,00.html\">01.05.2001: May Day mood begins to darken</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,480988,00.html\">01.05.2001, comment: Politics not parliament</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481222,00.html\">01.05.2001: Blair attacks 'spurious' May Day protest</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481125,00.html\">01.05.2001: Confusion reigns as police brace for mayhem</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481096,00.html\">01.05.2001, comment: Violence is our enemy</a></p> <p><b>Photo galleries</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,481316,00.html\">Pictures of today's protests in London</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,481339,00.html\">Pictures of today's protests around the world</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/flash/0,7365,477858,00.html \">Interactive guide to global protests </a><br></p> <p><b>Maps</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/graphic/0,7367,480993,00.html\">What's happened so far</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/graphic/0,7367,481480,00.html\">What's going on in Oxford Street</a></p> <p><b>How the Guardian is covering May Day</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481267,00.html\">01.05.2001: Keeping a level head</a></p> <p><b>Weblog special</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weblogindex2/0,6799,475360,00.html\">May Day 2001</a></p> <p><b>The issue explained </b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481489,00.html\">History of anti-capitalism protests</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,479726,00.html\">The May Day protests</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee81d50/0\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/\">May Day 2001 </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/globalisation/ \">Globalisation </a></p> <p><b>Net notes</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,214862,00.html \">May Day protests - the story in links</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,480911,00.html\">What kind of May Day protester are you?</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.maydaymonopoly.net/\" target=\"_new\">May Day Monopoly </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.urban75.com/\" target=\"_new\">Urban 75 </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.wombleaction.mrnice.net/\" target=\"_new\">Womble Action </a><br><a href=\"http://uk.indymedia.org/\" target=\"_NEW\">Independent Media Centre</a><br><a href=\"http://www.critical-mass.org/\" target=\"_NEW\">Critical Mass</a><br><a href=\"http://www.reclaimthestreets.net/\" target=\"_NEW\">Reclaim the Streets</a><br><a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">Greater London Assembly</a><br><a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Metropolitan police </a></p>",

The last few days have provided a clue, not in yesterday's stand-off, but at a quieter, less heralded confrontation a week earlier. It took place not in a rundown squat nor in Oxford Street, but in the main auditorium of the Barbican - venue of the annual general meeting of CGNU, the insurance giant which grew from the old Norwich Union. Lined up on stage, politburo-style, was the board of 16 directors. Facing them were CGNU's shareholders, representatives of big financial houses but also private individuals with just a share or two to their name. The chairman, Pehr Gyllenhammar, gave his annual report and then asked for questions from the floor. The first came from a representative of the South African National Union of Mineworkers, who reported that 60 people from his community back home had died from illnesses linked to asbestos. He wanted to ask about Norwich Union's 2% share in Cape plc, which used to mine asbestos in South Africa during the apartheid era and which is involved in a legal battle over compensation for 3,000 workers who, campaigners say, were poisoned in the process. \"I ask the chairman to give a one minute silence for those who died before ever receiving justice,\" said the man from the NUM. The chairman, peering down from his lofty perch on the platform, said there were lots of causes he sympathised with but he couldn't give a minute's silence for all of them. Next question? A second representative of the South African miners. Gyllenhammar shifts in his seat and repeats his earlier statement. Next? The director of Action for South Africa steps forward to say he's heard enough words from CGNU and wants some real pressure on Cape. \"We are getting on with our normal business,\" says the chairman stiffly. He wants another question and beckons a white man in a suit to come forward. Except he's an official of the GMB union and he, too, asks about asbestos. CGNU press officers are writhing in their seats with embarrassment: their day has been hijacked. It may not look like the May Day Monopoly carnival, but this clash is also an assault on global capitalism. The union officials may not have green hair; the Action for South Africa campaigners did not abseil into the Barbican but walked through the front entrance. Yet their challenge poses an equal - perhaps even greater - threat. F or they are playing capitalism at its own game. They were in the meeting, rather than demonstrating outside it, because they have bought shares in CGNU. Greenpeace played the same game at BP's get-together last month, tabling motions against the continued extraction of fossil fuels (apparently at odds with the company's promise to go \"beyond petroleum\") and its links with a Chinese firm now building a pipeline across Tibet. Company rules allow shareholder challenges - and these campaigners are playing the rules for all their worth. The result is unexpected proof of the migration of politics from Westminster to big business. For the CGNU debate proved a far livelier event than the average session at Labour party conference. All the old favourites were there: challenges to the chair, points of order, accusations against the leadership. It was enough to make you nostalgic. What's more, it's made possible by a classic exercise in Militant-style entryism - with Greenpeace and co infiltrating BP rather than the Labour party. They're no fools; they've gone where the power is. Could this be the next wave for the movement against capitalism, with activists trading their nose-studs for share portfolios? Noreena Hertz - whose incisive new book, The Silent Takeover, lays bare the coup big business has staged against democracy - cites \"shareholder activism,\" along with consumer action, as an immediately available weapon in the new war. She lights upon Sister Pa tricia Marshall, an American nun who has teamed up with churches and synagogues to form the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility. Their combined assets amount to $110bn, which the nuns and rabbis invest in target companies they hope to influence. So far Sister Patricia has persuaded Pepsi to pull out of Burma and Kimberley Clark, makers of Kleenex, to sell off its tobacco operations. Brent Blackwelder, the president of Friends of the Earth, tells Hertz: \"Corporations often ignore stakeholders, but they listen to shareholders.\" Of course there are limits. Greenpeace cannot afford the number of shares it would need to get BP policy changed. It has to rely on embarrassment power instead. Nor do pressure groups always know what corporations are up to; plenty of companies keep their most unattractive activities in the dark. What would help is full disclosure, with companies forced to lay their affairs out in the open. But that takes laws, and they require governments prepared to pass them - even in the teeth of fierce corporate opposition. No government dares take on big business alone - for fear the big firms will simply pull out, moving factories and jobs somewhere more hospitable - but if governments worked together they surely would be strong enough. The World Trade Organisation, instead of being a tool of the corporations, could be a weapon against them. Either way, we are all having to face up to a tough truth. Hurling rocks will not be enough; shareholder rebellions may only be a good start. This threat is global and serious - and so must be our response. jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com The London May Day protests at a glance Minute-by-minute coverage of the demonstrations Audio reports John Vidal witnesses a party atmosphere outside McDonald's in King's Cross, London (1min 45) Sarah Left on the Critical Mass cycle ride (2mins) Caption competition Send us a caption for this May Day picture and win a prize Related articles 01.05.2001: May Day could cost millions 01.05.2001: May Day protests grip London 01.05.2001: May Day mood begins to darken 01.05.2001, comment: Politics not parliament 01.05.2001: Blair attacks 'spurious' May Day protest 01.05.2001: Confusion reigns as police brace for mayhem 01.05.2001, comment: Violence is our enemy Photo galleries Pictures of today's protests in London Pictures of today's protests around the world Interactive guide Interactive guide to global protests Maps What's happened so far What's going on in Oxford Street How the Guardian is covering May Day 01.05.2001: Keeping a level head Weblog special May Day 2001 The issue explained History of anti-capitalism protests The May Day protests Talk about it What do you think?

At least 2,000 more GPs are promised: the number in training, which dropped 16% between 1990-1996, has now increased by 9%, with more promised.

Observers despair at the BMA's brutish ham-fisted behaviour. If GPs want a good contract that works well, their leaders' aggressive posturing makes it less likely. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

      "trailText": "<p>Their mix of African and Latin music made them stars. Then they got into gold lam\u00e9 and it all went horribly wrong. Can Orchestra Baobab ever recover? By <strong>Jane Cornwell</strong>.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> In the bougainvillea-strewn courtyard of Dakar's Cultural Centre, Rudi Gomis flicks through a tatty photo album and sighs nostalgically for the 1970s, the decade when Orchestra Baobab were the biggest band in Senegal. \"Everyone loved us,\" he says. \"Young, old, rich, poor. Everyone.\" </p> <p>Black-and-white snaps document guest appearances before prime ministers, judges and the military; at the selection of Miss Senegal and the inauguration of the former president, Abdou Diaf. Yellowing flyers advertise concerts in Guinea, Tunisia and France. The band's 13-strong line-up beam out from the pictures, wearing the wide-lapelled shirts of their heyday; a few pages later they are sporting the blue and gold lam\u00e9 numbers that coincided with their demise. </p> <p>Orchestra Baobab formed in 1970, taking their name from the swanky Baobab Club, and disbanded in the mid-1980s. Senegalese music was largely ignored outside Africa until 1985, the year Peter Gabriel met Youssou N'Dour in Dakar and brought to the west the singer's mbalax sound - where electric instruments follow the rhythms played by sabar drums. In his wake, local stars Baaba Maal and, to a lesser degree, Cheikh Lo achieved Anglo-American success in the 1990s. But before them all came Orchestra Baobab, packing houses and stadiums in an age when the band - not the individual - was the thing. Their delicate balance of Latin and African styles set them apart; their re-formation, for a one-off London gig at the Barbican this Saturday, promises to recall the understated cool of their prime. </p> <p>\"Baobab were different from other bands because we spent a lot of time working on harmonies and arrangements,\" says Gomis, now a teacher of French and Wolof, Senegal's national language. \"We had a more open attitude and better musicians. We were the first band to blend the Wolof folklore of the griots [traditional Senegalese storytellers] with salsa. All our members came from different regions. We were a m\u00e9tissage - a mix of everything.\" </p> <p>The 54-year-old would prefer to forget the lam\u00e9 period, when \"we brought in traditional sabar drums alongside kit-drums, congas and timbales. We wanted to keep up with the times, but it was too much - a cacophony,\" he says. </p> <p>It was a far cry from the laid back Afro-Cuban rhythms and mellow arrangements of Werente, their 1982 studio session. This spawned a bootlegging frenzy, eventually getting a 1989 album release under the title Pirate's Choice. Baobab's slow, sensuous reworkings of Cuban tunes enjoyed heavy attention from British world music fans, and the DJs Andy Kershaw and Charlie Gillett. Pirate's Choice has remained on lists of top 10 world music albums ever since. Recorded straight to two-track, its lo-fi tropical mix marks a time when Senegal was breaking away from the Latin sounds that had been coming through the port of Dakar since the 1940s. The country was rediscovering its own musical identity. \"We were,\" offers Gomis, \"the link between Cuban salsa and Youssou N'Dour's mbalax.\" </p> <p>Orchestra Baobab's line-up included griot singers, a jazz-influenced Malian saxophonist, a Moroccan guitarist, a Nigerian clarinet player and a Gambian drummer, all carried along by the fluid guitar of Barthelemy Atisso from Togo and the Latin-influenced songwriting of Gomis from Guinea Bissau. Vocalists took turns on the microphone, delivering dance turns and love songs in Spanish, Wolof, French and Portuguese Creole. </p> <p>Their fame stemmed, in part, from the fact that they were the first band to reconcile Dakar's chattering classes with the populace. For left- wing intellectuals, their Cuban influences helped to reinforce the severing of colonial ties, while their indigenous elements were embraced by people on the street. Above all, in a country that sways to innumerable rhythms, Orchestra Baobab defied audiences not to dance. \"Our fathers were dancing to Cuban bands like Sexteto Habanera in the 1930s,\" says Gomis. \"We felt in line with changa, salsa and cha cha cha. Our tunes are still played on the radio every day. Young people tell me they remember them as lullabies.\" </p> <p>When Baobab eventually broke up, the members dispersed to forge other careers.

      "bodyText": "In the bougainvillea-strewn courtyard of Dakar's Cultural Centre, Rudi Gomis flicks through a tatty photo album and sighs nostalgically for the 1970s, the decade when Orchestra Baobab were the biggest band in Senegal. \"Everyone loved us,\" he says. \"Young, old, rich, poor. Everyone.\" Black-and-white snaps document guest appearances before prime ministers, judges and the military; at the selection of Miss Senegal and the inauguration of the former president, Abdou Diaf. Yellowing flyers advertise concerts in Guinea, Tunisia and France. The band's 13-strong line-up beam out from the pictures, wearing the wide-lapelled shirts of their heyday; a few pages later they are sporting the blue and gold lam\u00e9 numbers that coincided with their demise. Orchestra Baobab formed in 1970, taking their name from the swanky Baobab Club, and disbanded in the mid-1980s. Senegalese music was largely ignored outside Africa until 1985, the year Peter Gabriel met Youssou N'Dour in Dakar and brought to the west the singer's mbalax sound - where electric instruments follow the rhythms played by sabar drums. In his wake, local stars Baaba Maal and, to a lesser degree, Cheikh Lo achieved Anglo-American success in the 1990s. But before them all came Orchestra Baobab, packing houses and stadiums in an age when the band - not the individual - was the thing. Their delicate balance of Latin and African styles set them apart; their re-formation, for a one-off London gig at the Barbican this Saturday, promises to recall the understated cool of their prime. \"Baobab were different from other bands because we spent a lot of time working on harmonies and arrangements,\" says Gomis, now a teacher of French and Wolof, Senegal's national language. \"We had a more open attitude and better musicians. We were the first band to blend the Wolof folklore of the griots [traditional Senegalese storytellers] with salsa. All our members came from different regions. We were a m\u00e9tissage - a mix of everything.\" The 54-year-old would prefer to forget the lam\u00e9 period, when \"we brought in traditional sabar drums alongside kit-drums, congas and timbales. We wanted to keep up with the times, but it was too much - a cacophony,\" he says. It was a far cry from the laid back Afro-Cuban rhythms and mellow arrangements of Werente, their 1982 studio session. This spawned a bootlegging frenzy, eventually getting a 1989 album release under the title Pirate's Choice. Baobab's slow, sensuous reworkings of Cuban tunes enjoyed heavy attention from British world music fans, and the DJs Andy Kershaw and Charlie Gillett. Pirate's Choice has remained on lists of top 10 world music albums ever since. Recorded straight to two-track, its lo-fi tropical mix marks a time when Senegal was breaking away from the Latin sounds that had been coming through the port of Dakar since the 1940s. The country was rediscovering its own musical identity. \"We were,\" offers Gomis, \"the link between Cuban salsa and Youssou N'Dour's mbalax.\" Orchestra Baobab's line-up included griot singers, a jazz-influenced Malian saxophonist, a Moroccan guitarist, a Nigerian clarinet player and a Gambian drummer, all carried along by the fluid guitar of Barthelemy Atisso from Togo and the Latin-influenced songwriting of Gomis from Guinea Bissau. Vocalists took turns on the microphone, delivering dance turns and love songs in Spanish, Wolof, French and Portuguese Creole. Their fame stemmed, in part, from the fact that they were the first band to reconcile Dakar's chattering classes with the populace. For left- wing intellectuals, their Cuban influences helped to reinforce the severing of colonial ties, while their indigenous elements were embraced by people on the street. Above all, in a country that sways to innumerable rhythms, Orchestra Baobab defied audiences not to dance. \"Our fathers were dancing to Cuban bands like Sexteto Habanera in the 1930s,\" says Gomis. \"We felt in line with changa, salsa and cha cha cha. Our tunes are still played on the radio every day. Young people tell me they remember them as lullabies.\" When Baobab eventually broke up, the members dispersed to forge other careers. Some now play in bands in the hotels of the Petite Cte, Senegal's Riviera. Atisso works as a lawyer. Gomis has had a couple of solo salsa releases but makes a living from teaching. They all, he insists, earn a pittance. Baobab's gigs once earned them the relatively huge sum of \u00a3800 a night and it was this that inhibited attempts to get them back together. \"Everyone thought we'd be too expensive, when we would simply have been happy to play our music. This is the beginning of something important.\" At the very least, with Gold and World Circuit behind them, their renaissance seems inevitable. Something similar to the Buena Vista Social Club phenomenon, perhaps? \"Maybe that's our destiny,\" Gomis grins. \"Now we just need a big film to let the world know about us.\" It is an optimism shared by other core members of the band, reunited at a Dakar restaurant the following day. Atisso has flown in from Togo for the first time in five years to join rehearsals for the Barbican and lay down demo tracks for a new album that will, if all goes well, be produced by N'Dour and released by World Circuit. After much general hilarity, pipe-smoking and comparing of stomachs (\"My bump is bigger than yours!\"), Gomis, Atisso, the vocalist Balla Sidibe and the drummer Mountaga Kouyate speak enthusiastically about their combined future. \"You see,\" says Gomis proudly, \"we are just like the tree we were named after.

Tonight he takes to the National Theatre stage in Edward Albee's Marriage Play, a one-acter about mid-life crisis and marital discord.

He is, wrote one critic recently, \"preferable to Douglas like Chateauneuf du Pape is preferable to a McDonald's shake\". </p> <p>Characteristically, Paterson credits others, especially director Alistair Reid, for Traffik's success - Baftas and Emmys rained down upon it. But his own involvement was no less intense.\"We started filming in Karachi within a week of the fatwa on Salman Rushdie,\" he recalls. \"To say tensions were running high is putting it mildly.\" The tension intensified as Traffik was drawn into the world it sought to depict. \"For one scene, we actually made heroin, and when the police guarding us realised we were destroying it after filming, they said, 'We could get rid of that for you, boys. You don't need to destroy it, just pass it over.' It was very, very strange.\" </p> <p>Lesser actors might have felt out of their depth, but Paterson is an old hand at making drama that impinges upon real life. After two years as a quantity surveyor, then training as a drama teacher, he got his break as a performer in an Edinburgh Festival agitprop extravaganza by the young Billy Connolly. The Great Northern Welly Boot Show was a satire on the predicament of the striking Upper Clyde Shipbuilders. It went on to become \" the event of 1972.

It was an entertainment in the style of a Highland ceilidh that made connections between the Clearances and the foreign exploitation of North Sea oil. Paterson acted, MC'd, sang and played the bagpipes in the whisky-soaked shindig into which each gig evolved. </p> <p>\"It was a life-changing experience,\" says Paterson, \"and it really did open doors.\" Thirty years on, The Cheviot looks almost exotic - a stirring example of how performance can tackle the politics that directly affect people's lives in a rumbustious, participatory way. \"What made it work,\" says Paterson, \"was that everybody was encouraged to bring their own material to it.\" Does he miss that? \"I wouldn't mind having half the energy to do it again.\" He has recently approached McGrath about revisiting The Cheviot, \"to look again at what we got right and what we got completely wrong\". </p> <p>He's clearly still a political animal, so is he nostalgic for socially committed theatre? \"I always hate to say nobody is doing it now, because there are probably plenty of people who are.\" He cites Sarah Kane's Blasted, which his wife, Hildegard Bechtler, designed, as proof \"there are political plays being written, without a doubt.

Dating from the late 1950s and originally entitled Cheryomushki, this unclassifiable work takes a satirical swipe at spineless apparatchiks, socialist realism and the Soviet passion for urban planning. It is the only musical blockbuster ever written about a tower block. </p> <p>Cheryomushki itself is a monolithic overspill development on the outskirts of Moscow - the kind of grim post-war monstrosity that purported to offer the ultimate in urban living. In Shostakovich's comedy, developers and party workers are so busy feathering their own nests that the tenants have to seize their prefabricated paradise by force. </p> <p>It is not really an opera, but nor is it quite a musical. Cheryomushki's boppy rhythms and fixed-grin bravado suggest that Shostakovich could have made a profitable career as a jingle-writer for Radio 2, or perhaps he ought to be acknowledged as the grandfather of Europop. But who do you engage to perform such a hybrid? Opera singers? Musical actors? S Club 7? </p> <p>Cheryomushki requires a large, exceptionally versatile cast who can act, sing and dance, the difficulty being that Shostakovich took light music very seriously indeed. Much of the vocal writing lies outside the compass of the average musical actor, while the high-octane dance routines are beyond the capabilities of most opera singers. The director of Opera North's new \"English-language\" production, David Pountney, has opted for a pick-and-mix approach, drawing his cast from the worlds of opera and musical theatre. </p> <p>Cheryomushki thus provides a rare opportunity to encounter performers as diverse as Alan Oke and Janie Dee on the same stage. Oke is a tenor who recently starred in the Madame Butterfly in-the-round spectacular at the Royal Albert Hall, while Dee won the Olivier award for best actress last year for her role in an Alan Ayckbourn play. </p> <p>Oke and Dee admit they initially found it odd working together. \"I soon discovered that the big difference between opera and musicals is the amount of attention paid to the voice,\" says Dee. \"When these singers were training they spent six or seven hours a day on their voice - I did barely a quarter of that.\" </p> <p>Oke interprets this the other way round. \"Being a singer is a bit like being a bodybuilder,\" he says. \"You are constantly working to refine a very select group of vocal muscles. It doesn't necessarily make you particularly mobile or a natural actor.\" </p> <p>Cheryomushki is the kind of piece that encourages everyone to develop new talents. In the final run-through Dee is casually flung over her partner's shoul der as they perfect the choreography of a jitterbug pastiche. Chorus members practise balancing motionlessly on pedestals in the guise of heroic monuments to the Russian construction industry. Oke swings past, singing his aria from a trolley upstage. He later reveals that he will deliver this number in a basket, suspended from a crane. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, musical opinion has tended to dismiss Cheryomushki as the ugly duckling of Shostakovich's career, but the remarkable thing is that it was written at all. Soviet opera was a sombre affair. Dour, state-approved organisations such as the Association of Proletarian Musicians were responsible for such ideological conceits as renaming Tosca the Struggle for the Commune, and altering the story so that the painting of the Madonna was turned into a fresco glorifying the international Red Army. Tosca, as one wag pointed out, became tosk\u00e1 - the Russian word for despair. </p> <p>The avant-garde impulse of Shostakovich's early works was unlikely to remain unchecked for long. In 1936 the composer's operatic career was curtailed when Stalin attended a performance of Shostakovich's second full-length opera, Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District. The assessment of the work as degenerate resulted in a vicious media onslaught, and for a time the composer was fearful for his life. </p> <p>But if Lady Macbeth was the opera Stalin didn't want to hear, Cheryomushki is the piece musicologists prefer not to talk about. For those who would rather dissect the meaning of the great symphonies and string quartets, Cheryomushki remains a perpetual embarrassment - an encapsulation of the banality and spiritual impoverishment of social realist art. In truth, Shostakovich was simply thawing out in the post-Stalin climate and having fun in a genre he enjoyed. It is the sound of a serious composer blowing a raspberry. </p> <p>The conductor Jim Holmes points out that Shostakovich had a lively sense of humour. \"He used to earn a crust from playing piano accompaniment to silent movies, and throughout his career he continued to write brilliant, witty ballets, film scores and incidental music,\" Holmes explains. \"The tragedy is that the Communist party drove him from the stage - but when Stalin's death finally made it possible for him to write another opera, he came up with a genuinely popular, proletarian comedy. Cheryomushki really is music for the masses - which makes it almost impossible to tell whether Shostakovich was toeing the line or taking the mickey.\" </p> <p>Of course it is not impossible that he was doing both at the same time. Since the composer's death in 1975, critics have been squabbling over whether Shostakovich spent his career openly exulting Communism, or secretly excoriating it. Attention has invariably been focused on the message behind the \"serious\" works: but perhaps there are more clues to be found in this disposably light-hearted, deadly serious little musical. Cheryomushki is a perfect example of Noel Coward's remark about the amazing potency of cheap music.</p> <p>\u0095 Paradise Moscow is at the Grand Theatre, Leeds (0113-222 6222), from May 3 to 12, Sadler's Wells, London EC1 (020-7863 8000), from May 23 to 26, and then tours.

The move, which extends unpaid leave by three months, was welcomed by family campaigners, though there were calls for the government to grant new parents the right to work flexible or reduced hours. Ministers are still debating the option, which has not been ruled out but is met with caution in Downing Street because of business opposition - reinforced by the CBI yesterday. In the latest of a string of pre-election announcements targeted at women and the family, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, will today give details of a \u00a3100m upgrade of maternity units across the country, designed to give mothers more choice over how and where their babies are delivered. He will address the Royal College of Midwives the day after members warned that they felt their role was undervalued and pressed for more government funding for the service. Steps to extend maternity leave are part of a package of measures to improve and streamline maternity rights, while seeking to keep employers on board.

      "trailText": "<p>The government's new parental leave scheme seems a lifesaver for parents who struggle to balance work and family. But, as  Anna Macarthur reveals, there's a catch.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is the perpetual fear of all working parents: that dreaded phone call in the middle of the morning rush from the childminder who is too sick to work. Or perhaps one of the children has developed a temperature and, just to be on the safe side, the nursery staff think she would be better off at home. </p> <p>Either way, the parents are in limbo and due at their desk within the hour. It's decision time, with most guardians torn between confessing the truth to the personnel department, which retaliates by quickly snatching the last few precious days of annual leave; and opting for the more devious route of phoning in sick and listening to the boss grumbling about never employing a parent again. </p> <p>What mums and dads desperately need is a \"get out of work free\" card - and the EU's parental leave directive appears to fit the bill. It allows all parents with children born after December 15 the chance to take up to 13 weeks' extra unpaid holiday. And, following a 16-month campaign by the TUC, which included the threat of high-court action by Cherie Booth, the government finally backed down and agreed last week to extend the right to all parents with children under the age of five. </p> <p>At last, there seemed to be a chance for parents to take a deep breath and stop panicking every time their offspring need immunisation, or a check-up with the health visitor, or simply go down with one of those things children are always going down with. On the face of it, the new law is a triumph for working parents, heralding a new era of family-friendly practices in the workplace. </p> <p>But there is a snag. While the extension of the EU directive might be a step in the right direction, parental leave is not all it is cracked up to be. Not only is it unpaid, but it must be taken in blocks of one week, is only available to workers who have been with their company for more than a year, and is conditional on employees giving their companies at least three weeks' notice. </p> <p>To cap it all, if the employer can prove that the granting of parental leave would be detrimental to their business, your leave can be postponed for up to six months. Not too handy if the childminder called in sick this morning. </p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry's senior policy adviser for employee relations, Graham Morton, agrees that there has been some confusion over what the new entitlement is for. \"There is a misunderstanding, as it is not meant for emergencies,\" he said. \"The kind of situation it might be used for is if care is provided informally by the extended family, who are going on holiday.\" The parents can then book additional time off from work to stay at home and look after their kids. But they would still be forced to take the leave in blocks of one week, each time losing that whole week's wages. Unless parents are able to negotiate a special deal with their employers, they could end up severely out of pocket - with no salary and a bill for the childminder's holiday pay. </p> <p>According to the GMB's head of equal rights, Karen Constantine, this explains why there has been a slow take-up of the scheme. Her union surveyed 200 members last year, and found that only one had taken advantage of the parental leave directive. \"Parents can't afford a period of time where they are unpaid,\" she says. \"If they are working a 60-hour week to make ends meet, how are they going to afford to take time off unpaid? </p> <p>\"The majority will end up robbing Peter to pay Paul. And it will be nigh on impossible for single-parent families to capitalise on the scheme.\" </p> <p>Full-time working mother Liz Easton says that she would relish the chance to spend more time at home with her two-year-old son Pip: \"I've been thinking about taking him to the clinic just to check up on his weight and height, but it's only open during working hours. I'd like to think that I could take some time off as a bonding time with Pip and not just use up holidays for emergencies. </p> <p>\"The 13 weeks would be useful if we had a real crisis, but I wouldn't really be able to afford it and would need to rely on my credit card.\" </p> <p>The only hope for parents forced to fritter away their annual vacation on the odd day here and there is to negotiate with their employers. Some companies have proved to be more sympathetic than others. Easton's previous employer, a large insurance company, could afford to be \"quite family-friendly\", offering 25 days' annual leave plus flexitime, which meant that Liz could leave work at 3.30pm or save up overtime to pay for extra days off.

      "bodyText": "It is the perpetual fear of all working parents: that dreaded phone call in the middle of the morning rush from the childminder who is too sick to work. Or perhaps one of the children has developed a temperature and, just to be on the safe side, the nursery staff think she would be better off at home. Either way, the parents are in limbo and due at their desk within the hour. It's decision time, with most guardians torn between confessing the truth to the personnel department, which retaliates by quickly snatching the last few precious days of annual leave; and opting for the more devious route of phoning in sick and listening to the boss grumbling about never employing a parent again. What mums and dads desperately need is a \"get out of work free\" card - and the EU's parental leave directive appears to fit the bill. It allows all parents with children born after December 15 the chance to take up to 13 weeks' extra unpaid holiday. And, following a 16-month campaign by the TUC, which included the threat of high-court action by Cherie Booth, the government finally backed down and agreed last week to extend the right to all parents with children under the age of five. At last, there seemed to be a chance for parents to take a deep breath and stop panicking every time their offspring need immunisation, or a check-up with the health visitor, or simply go down with one of those things children are always going down with. On the face of it, the new law is a triumph for working parents, heralding a new era of family-friendly practices in the workplace. But there is a snag. While the extension of the EU directive might be a step in the right direction, parental leave is not all it is cracked up to be. Not only is it unpaid, but it must be taken in blocks of one week, is only available to workers who have been with their company for more than a year, and is conditional on employees giving their companies at least three weeks' notice. To cap it all, if the employer can prove that the granting of parental leave would be detrimental to their business, your leave can be postponed for up to six months. Not too handy if the childminder called in sick this morning. The Department of Trade and Industry's senior policy adviser for employee relations, Graham Morton, agrees that there has been some confusion over what the new entitlement is for. \"There is a misunderstanding, as it is not meant for emergencies,\" he said. \"The kind of situation it might be used for is if care is provided informally by the extended family, who are going on holiday.\" The parents can then book additional time off from work to stay at home and look after their kids. But they would still be forced to take the leave in blocks of one week, each time losing that whole week's wages. Unless parents are able to negotiate a special deal with their employers, they could end up severely out of pocket - with no salary and a bill for the childminder's holiday pay. According to the GMB's head of equal rights, Karen Constantine, this explains why there has been a slow take-up of the scheme. Her union surveyed 200 members last year, and found that only one had taken advantage of the parental leave directive. \"Parents can't afford a period of time where they are unpaid,\" she says. \"If they are working a 60-hour week to make ends meet, how are they going to afford to take time off unpaid? \"The majority will end up robbing Peter to pay Paul. And it will be nigh on impossible for single-parent families to capitalise on the scheme.\" Full-time working mother Liz Easton says that she would relish the chance to spend more time at home with her two-year-old son Pip: \"I've been thinking about taking him to the clinic just to check up on his weight and height, but it's only open during working hours. I'd like to think that I could take some time off as a bonding time with Pip and not just use up holidays for emergencies. \"The 13 weeks would be useful if we had a real crisis, but I wouldn't really be able to afford it and would need to rely on my credit card.\" The only hope for parents forced to fritter away their annual vacation on the odd day here and there is to negotiate with their employers. Some companies have proved to be more sympathetic than others. Easton's previous employer, a large insurance company, could afford to be \"quite family-friendly\", offering 25 days' annual leave plus flexitime, which meant that Liz could leave work at 3.30pm or save up overtime to pay for extra days off. But working for a smaller company makes it difficult to take advantage of such rights. Fashion worker and mother of two Ann Hodge, who recently quit her part-time job, felt it was unlikely that her company would have been receptive to the idea of additional holidays on top of annual leave. \"Working for a small firm, they would have frowned upon it if I'd mentioned extra holidays,\" she says. \"If I had stuck to my guns and taken it, then it would have made relations in the office strained and life difficult.\" T errence Libby, who employs 50 men and women at his manu-facturing company in Northamptonshire, explains why the parental leave directive is a strain on small business: \"There has already been an excessive extension of employees' rights over the last 18 months.

      "body": "<p>For once, the anarchists turned up early. A little after 2pm yesterday, almost two hours before the official start of the grand finale of the Mayday Monopoly action, more than 1,000 protesters began converging on Oxford Circus in central London.</p> <p>Despite the rain, they arrived in high spirits. A series of protests across the city had been low-key but upbeat. The police had been out in force - in places outnumbering demonstrators by 20 to one - but dire warnings of serious trouble had proved unfounded. In the hub of the West End, the shopping and tourist centre of London, all that changed.</p> <p>The protest leaders had dubbed the Oxford Street event the Sale of the Century, the culmination of the day's action scheduled to kick off at 4pm. They insisted it was to be a massive street party; police claimed the real purpose was to attack and loot the stores lining the street. Determined to take no chances, the \"zero tolerance\" operation went into action.</p> <p>When the first protesters reached Oxford Circus after 2pm, they were met by a wall of police, backed up by dozens of vans and mounted officers.</p> <p>The protesters tried to continue north along Regent Street but were forced back. As chants of \"Whose street? Our street!\" rang out, police in riot gear formed a sec ond line of defence behind the uniformed officers, and a line of police vans was moved to form a surge barrier. Oxford Circus underground station was closed. Within minutes, all four routes out of the crossroads were blocked and about 1,000 protesters were sealed into the junction in what amounted to a mass arrest.</p> <p>For a while, the crowd remained good-natured. They continued to chant and shout. A football was tossed around, between the banners and huge cardboard cutouts of cartoon fat cats.</p> <p>But by 3pm, with the weather deteriorating, the crowd was still sealed in tight together by lines of police in riot gear, and the mood was rapidly turning sour.</p> <p>Many bystanders were hemmed in with the protesters. Two German tourists missed their flight home after being sealed in by police and refused permission to leave, even though they showed them their passports and airline tickets.</p> <p>Carol Nahra, 33, who works in Poland Street, near Oxford Circus, had popped out for her lunchbreak only to be caught in the stand-off. \"There's nowhere to go to the bathroom, and people are having to use the stairs into the tube station,\" she said. \"Everyone is so cold and they're trying to jump up and down to keep warm.</p> <p>\"I think the crowds would have dissipated a long time ago if the police had let people go. A lot of people are resigned to be stuck here for a while, but as soon as it starts to rain they get angry.\"</p> <p><b> Fainted</b><br> As the stalemate continued, Garfunkels on Great Castle Street became the riot police cafe, shelter and emergency treatment centre for the few protesters who were injured or traumatised. In two hours, four people who had fainted were brought in for sweet tea.</p> <p>But mainly Garfunkels was where the riot police went to use the toilet. First, they had to unzip their flame-proof trousers, then remove a cricket box, burrow through another pair of trousers and then reach their underpants. \"It's a bloody nightmare, this,\" said No 721. (For a woman PC it is even worse: \"I have to almost completely get undressed. It takes about half an hour. Not much good in a riot,\" said one).</p> <p>Outside, the mood was becoming increasingly volatile. Just after 3pm, there was a countdown from 10 to one at which point the crowd trapped at the crossroads tried to break through the police line up Regent Street. A firework went off behind the police lines. Bottles were thrown but police succeeded in pushing the surging protesters back. A lot of shoving, but still nothing serious.</p> <p>Around the corner, Inspector Simon Earle was content with events. \"Although there are a lot of them, the mood was quite pleasant. The odd bottle was thrown but most of them have been sensible and it doesn't seem to have escalated.\"</p> <p>Responding to the suggestion that police containment tactics might be provoking problems, he shrugged. \"We are wrong if we do and wrong if we don't.\"</p> <p>But with hundreds of protesters continuing to arrive in the West End for the Sale of the Century event, police found themselves constantly having to establish and defend new containment areas to keep the increasingly angry crowds apart. As they moved through the maze of side streets in west Soho and east Mayfair which border Oxford Street, a tense game of cat-and-mouse began to unfold.</p> <p>At 4.40pm, around 500 protesters managed to outflank the police and break through from Holles Street into Oxford Street, just 50 yards from the main group. After several minutes, riot police were brought in to force them back, with several protesters injured in the struggle. Assistant commissioner Mike Todd conceded that officers \"needed to regain control\".</p> <p>A few hours earlier, it had looked as if serious trouble was going to be avoided. For six hours, London enjoyed its quietest May Day in years and for the 5,000 protesters it was a dream: 6,000 sweet-as-pie police officers, the City eerily empty, and thousands of journalists concentrating not on the violence but why people had taken the day off to protest.</p> <p>The first throw of the Monopoly dice was a bike ride converging on King's Cross from Marylebone station to the west and Liverpool Street to the east.

      "bodyText": "For once, the anarchists turned up early. A little after 2pm yesterday, almost two hours before the official start of the grand finale of the Mayday Monopoly action, more than 1,000 protesters began converging on Oxford Circus in central London. Despite the rain, they arrived in high spirits. A series of protests across the city had been low-key but upbeat. The police had been out in force - in places outnumbering demonstrators by 20 to one - but dire warnings of serious trouble had proved unfounded. In the hub of the West End, the shopping and tourist centre of London, all that changed. The protest leaders had dubbed the Oxford Street event the Sale of the Century, the culmination of the day's action scheduled to kick off at 4pm. They insisted it was to be a massive street party; police claimed the real purpose was to attack and loot the stores lining the street. Determined to take no chances, the \"zero tolerance\" operation went into action. When the first protesters reached Oxford Circus after 2pm, they were met by a wall of police, backed up by dozens of vans and mounted officers. The protesters tried to continue north along Regent Street but were forced back. As chants of \"Whose street? Our street!\" rang out, police in riot gear formed a sec ond line of defence behind the uniformed officers, and a line of police vans was moved to form a surge barrier. Oxford Circus underground station was closed. Within minutes, all four routes out of the crossroads were blocked and about 1,000 protesters were sealed into the junction in what amounted to a mass arrest. For a while, the crowd remained good-natured. They continued to chant and shout. A football was tossed around, between the banners and huge cardboard cutouts of cartoon fat cats. But by 3pm, with the weather deteriorating, the crowd was still sealed in tight together by lines of police in riot gear, and the mood was rapidly turning sour. Many bystanders were hemmed in with the protesters. Two German tourists missed their flight home after being sealed in by police and refused permission to leave, even though they showed them their passports and airline tickets. Carol Nahra, 33, who works in Poland Street, near Oxford Circus, had popped out for her lunchbreak only to be caught in the stand-off. \"There's nowhere to go to the bathroom, and people are having to use the stairs into the tube station,\" she said. \"Everyone is so cold and they're trying to jump up and down to keep warm. \"I think the crowds would have dissipated a long time ago if the police had let people go. A lot of people are resigned to be stuck here for a while, but as soon as it starts to rain they get angry.\" Fainted As the stalemate continued, Garfunkels on Great Castle Street became the riot police cafe, shelter and emergency treatment centre for the few protesters who were injured or traumatised. In two hours, four people who had fainted were brought in for sweet tea. But mainly Garfunkels was where the riot police went to use the toilet. First, they had to unzip their flame-proof trousers, then remove a cricket box, burrow through another pair of trousers and then reach their underpants. \"It's a bloody nightmare, this,\" said No 721. (For a woman PC it is even worse: \"I have to almost completely get undressed. It takes about half an hour. Not much good in a riot,\" said one). Outside, the mood was becoming increasingly volatile. Just after 3pm, there was a countdown from 10 to one at which point the crowd trapped at the crossroads tried to break through the police line up Regent Street. A firework went off behind the police lines. Bottles were thrown but police succeeded in pushing the surging protesters back. A lot of shoving, but still nothing serious. Around the corner, Inspector Simon Earle was content with events. \"Although there are a lot of them, the mood was quite pleasant. The odd bottle was thrown but most of them have been sensible and it doesn't seem to have escalated.\" Responding to the suggestion that police containment tactics might be provoking problems, he shrugged. \"We are wrong if we do and wrong if we don't.\" But with hundreds of protesters continuing to arrive in the West End for the Sale of the Century event, police found themselves constantly having to establish and defend new containment areas to keep the increasingly angry crowds apart. As they moved through the maze of side streets in west Soho and east Mayfair which border Oxford Street, a tense game of cat-and-mouse began to unfold. At 4.40pm, around 500 protesters managed to outflank the police and break through from Holles Street into Oxford Street, just 50 yards from the main group. After several minutes, riot police were brought in to force them back, with several protesters injured in the struggle. Assistant commissioner Mike Todd conceded that officers \"needed to regain control\". A few hours earlier, it had looked as if serious trouble was going to be avoided. For six hours, London enjoyed its quietest May Day in years and for the 5,000 protesters it was a dream: 6,000 sweet-as-pie police officers, the City eerily empty, and thousands of journalists concentrating not on the violence but why people had taken the day off to protest. The first throw of the Monopoly dice was a bike ride converging on King's Cross from Marylebone station to the west and Liverpool Street to the east. As the police whizzed around in their rented vans, the 250 cyclists fluffed around, lay in the middle of Euston Road reading books, ate their giveaway veggie burgers outside arch-enemy McDonald's. \"We are celebrating life, we are not interested in violence,\" said a man in rainbow-striped clothes calling himself Prof Kayoss. Three miles away, at Hyde Park Corner, another tribe was meeting. The homeless and asylum seekers and their supporters were, it was said, going to build a symbolic cardboard hotel on Park Lane, just like in the Monopoly game. It was more like a studio flat in Peckham; one small man managed, just, to get in it. Across the Thames on the Elephant and Castle roundabout, the south London mayday collective had invited protesters to an anti-capitalist picnic. \"One of the best things about the layout of these demonstrations is that there are a lot of different, small actions,\" said Alistair. \"There are not enough people here for this to get out of hand.\" At the time, his words seemed reasonable enough. A few hours later, they had been proved wildly optimistic. As darkness fell on Oxford Street, police faced escalating attacks from protesters furious at being penned in all day. Outside the John Lewis department store, officers struggled on three fronts to contain various groups of protesters. A few used the shop's canopy as a platform to drop missiles down on police and it was more than an hour before police regained control. Late last night, sporadic skirmishes were continuing from Oxford Street into Soho, with several shops and banks being attacked. Police were continuing to disperse the remaining pockets of protesters from the area. But they were only to allowed to leave in single file and only after giving their names and addresses and having their photographs taken. \"We're being treated like terrorists but all we're doing is showing that we're a bit pissed off with the way things are,\" said Ross Batman, 20, from Kent. \"I am just here to make a stand because people don't seem to have a voice anymore but even when we're standing in the street they just section us off so we can't mingle with ordinary people.\" The London May Day protests at a glance Minute-by-minute coverage of the demonstrations Audio reports John Vidal witnesses a party atmosphere outside McDonald's in King's Cross, London (1min 45) Sarah Left on the Critical Mass cycle ride (2mins) Caption competition Send us a caption for this May Day picture and win a prize Related articles 01.05.2001: May Day could cost millions 01.05.2001: May Day protests grip London 01.05.2001: May Day mood begins to darken 01.05.2001, comment: Politics not parliament 01.05.2001: Blair attacks 'spurious' May Day protest 01.05.2001: Confusion reigns as police brace for mayhem 01.05.2001, comment: Violence is our enemy Photo galleries Pictures of today's protests in London Pictures of today's protests around the world Interactive guide Interactive guide to global protests Maps What's happened so far What's going on in Oxford Street How the Guardian is covering May Day 01.05.2001: Keeping a level head Weblog special May Day 2001 The issue explained History of anti-capitalism protests The May Day protests Talk about it What do you think?

He believes blessings and even exorcism can prove beneficial to patients if performed sensitively.</p> <p>\"Many people believe their voices are rooted in demonic possession and many have explored this safely with a minister,\" said Mr Smith, an atheist. \"I know of one Scottish woman who was brought out of her distress through exorcism. Once she was able to put the experience in a religious framework she felt more in control and the voices stopped being so disruptive. After the spirits were cast out they went away and she's now functioning normally.\"</p> <p>Mr Smith said the input of clergy could be valuable, as it could be hard for psychiatric nurses to differentiate between clients who were in a spiritual crisis and those suffering from a mental health problem. \"In my experience, the Church is quite good at detecting when people are ill,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The context of the voices or spirits is crucial. If I were to say I was hearing the voice of God that would be different to someone from a very religious background, especially one which involves the belief in spirits, admitting the same thing. The problem may be down to stress caused by some conflict in their life, such as sexuality, with their religion rather than an illness.\"</p> <p>However, despite such progressive approaches, concern about exorcism remains high among mental health charities, health professionals and among senior Church figures. There are particular fears about charismatic Anglican groups that take a fundamentalist approach to demonic possession.</p> <p>\"I saw a brother and sister who had been exorcised by a cousin from Scotland after their parents' funeral,\" said Mr Ryder. \"He had heard them talking about transcendental meditation and believed this could have let evil spirits enter them. He exorcised them both but the girl had a particularly unpleasant reaction, retching and vomiting. They both felt they had been spiritually abused.</p> <p>\"I believe if you shout out the names of spirits and demons to be powerful you create a response in the 'host' like in the film The Exorcist.\"</p> <p>Dr David McDonald, a psychiatrist who has advised the Church of England, said this \"Bible-bashing approach\" did not accept anything other than a spiritual cause to people's distress: \"I have seen clients who were told they're possessed and an exorcism was performed but they felt no better. They believe they must be really evil if God can't help them, which can be terribly damaging.\"</p> <p>In a survey last year by the Mental Health Foundation, entitled Spirituality and mental health: voices and realities, several respondents said they had been damaged by exorcism. The charity warned that the notion of demonic possession could be extremely damaging when linked to people with a label of mental illness and \"risked conflating notions of evil and ill health.\"</p> <p>Strategies for Living project coordinator at the MHF, Vicky Nicholls said: \"One respondent from a Pentecostal background said a priest had placed their hands on them and said 'Let the demons be gone!' Most felt such practices had contributed to their mental health problems.\"</p> <p>The Rev Stephen Parsons, author of Ungodly Fear: Fundamentalist Christianity and the abuse of power, said: \"The charismatic movement wants to demonise mental illness so they can deal with it through exorcism. They say the Lord has given them a special insight that science and medicine cannot offer. But persuading vulnerable people that they are possessed gives you a great deal of power over them. It's a form of emotional abuse.\"</p> <p>Mr Parsons said sexual abuse, homosexuality and unwanted pregnancy were often seen as routes for demonic possession. \"Imagine telling someone who has been raped they're now possessed - that is terribly abusive.\"</p> <p>However, Dr Chris Simpson, consultant psychiatrist at Friarage Hospital, Northallerton, who has treated many people after receiving deliverance, believes exorcism does not in itself cause a great deal of mental illness.</p> <p>\"The problem comes when a spiritual approach leads to a delay in receiving psychiatric help. If people bypass mental health services a lot of problems will be missed. So having the Church and the psychiatric profession work together when someone has a spiritual belief system can be beneficial.\"</p>",

They believe they must be really evil if God can't help them, which can be terribly damaging.\" In a survey last year by the Mental Health Foundation, entitled Spirituality and mental health: voices and realities, several respondents said they had been damaged by exorcism. The charity warned that the notion of demonic possession could be extremely damaging when linked to people with a label of mental illness and \"risked conflating notions of evil and ill health.\" Strategies for Living project coordinator at the MHF, Vicky Nicholls said: \"One respondent from a Pentecostal background said a priest had placed their hands on them and said 'Let the demons be gone!' Most felt such practices had contributed to their mental health problems.\" The Rev Stephen Parsons, author of Ungodly Fear: Fundamentalist Christianity and the abuse of power, said: \"The charismatic movement wants to demonise mental illness so they can deal with it through exorcism. They say the Lord has given them a special insight that science and medicine cannot offer. But persuading vulnerable people that they are possessed gives you a great deal of power over them. It's a form of emotional abuse.\" Mr Parsons said sexual abuse, homosexuality and unwanted pregnancy were often seen as routes for demonic possession. \"Imagine telling someone who has been raped they're now possessed - that is terribly abusive.\" However, Dr Chris Simpson, consultant psychiatrist at Friarage Hospital, Northallerton, who has treated many people after receiving deliverance, believes exorcism does not in itself cause a great deal of mental illness. \"The problem comes when a spiritual approach leads to a delay in receiving psychiatric help. If people bypass mental health services a lot of problems will be missed. So having the Church and the psychiatric profession work together when someone has a spiritual belief system can be beneficial.\"",

Afterwards I searched him and it turned out he wasn't armed. He didn't surrender, so I did my job. He could have had a pistol or a grenade. I didn't even consider whether he was armed or not. I just reacted to seeing him and I shot him.\" </p> <p>John was 19 when he was sent to the Falklands. He had joined the Parachute Regiment two years earlier and had already had a tour of duty in Northern Ireland. But the Falklands came as a complete shock. </p> <p>\"I knew I was going to go to Northern Ireland, but I never thought I would ever go to war,\" he says. \"It turned out to be very inhuman, very alien. War is not a glorious thing and anyone who makes out it is is a fool.\" </p> <p>Now 38, John has spent the last 20 years trying to recover from his army experiences. Like soldiers in conflicts before, and after, the gruesome reality of killing people, seeing your friends - and even, as in John's case, your own brother - blown up or shot, was all too much for him. And for almost two decades, no one wanted to help. </p> <p>Linda Winn, clinical director of Combat Stress, the ex-services mental welfare society, says John's experience is typical. \"We help people aged from 19 to 95,\" she says. \"As long as people are psychologically robust enough, we take them. People may think that shell shock or flashbacks are only suffered by veterans of the world wars. But that's not true. We have a lot of younger people coming through now, from the Gulf, the Balkans and Northern Ireland.\" </p> <p>Combat Stress aims to help these men - and a few women - deal with their problems at its three residential centres in Surrey, Shropshire and Strathclyde. \"The people who come here are suffering from psychological injuries resulting from their service experience,\" says Winn of the 2,000 or so people Combat Stress helps annually. \"Quite often they're very angry and we try to give them a feeling of control. The sooner people can be referred, the more successful the treatment.\" </p> <p>Last month, an extreme case of what can happen to someone who was not helped made its way into the news. George Daley, 80, an ex-Royal Artillery private from the second world war, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He had been woken from a deep sleep by fireworks and thought he had returned to the battlefields of North Africa. When his 85-year-old neighbour appeared, he was convinced she was the enemy breaking into his home and he stabbed her. </p> <p>\"Flashbacks can last for seconds or hours,\" says Winn. \"And they can be triggered by so many things. They also have residual effects. Afterwards you feel disturbed and distraught. </p> <p>\"We have found that with ex-Far East prisoners of war, the flashbacks and nightmares are often so strong that they think people are talking to them in Japanese. Some attack their wives, thinking they are Japanese soldiers.\" </p> <p>John, too, felt out of control. \"When I returned from the Falklands, I wanted out of the army urgently,\" he says. \"I never wanted to be put in that situation again and I left about a year afterwards.\" The memories, however, have remained. </p> <p>\"I've got no concept of time when it comes to the Falklands. It's all very blurred. I just know I left in April and came back in August. I get flashbacks and they're like a montage of events from Goose Green to Wireless Ridge, which were two weeks apart. I see them pretty much together. Goose Green was a bloody battle. It was very conventional. There was bayoneting and hand-to-hand combat. Trenches were being cleared.\" </p> <p>John was in an alcoholic haze for years. He went from one job to another, but was often drunk, violent and extremely angry. He also began to abuse drugs. And he was not the only one of his former colleagues with problems. </p> <p>\"When we got back, there were no offers of help,\" he says. \"The flashbacks were triggered by a variety of things, including news items and war films, but we got no psychological help. It was OK being with my mates, but I had real problems with other people. People thought they could pick your brains for a pint of lager. Then the first question was the most insensitive you can ask anyone who's just back from combat - if you killed anyone. That puts you in places you don't want to be. It can instantly set off a flashback.\" </p> <p>John was violent and depressed. His behaviour even led to a three-month spell in prison for GBH. \"I had no fear of anything. I wasn't scared of the police, of authority. Nothing. And of course I was suffering from awful nightmares and flashbacks. </p> <p>\"Times have changed too,\" he adds. \"From world war two it seems like everybody was involved. After the war, your local bobby was also a veteran. He didn't arrest the drunken ex-soldier on the ground; he took him home and put him into bed. Nowadays there's no tolerance. I've got more in common with a pensioner who fought the Germans 60 years ago than I have with some of my own generation.\" </p> <p>Eventually a friend told John to get help. \"He was sure I had post traumatic stress disorder, but I said I was fine. He replied that nobody was safe walking down the street with me around.\" </p> <p>John's doctor recommended a psychiatrist. That helped a little, but the treatment was stopped when the GP could no longer fund it. Finally, two years ago, John spoke to the war pensions agency, which recommended the residential courses run by Combat Stress (the agency funds 80% of the charity's costs). </p> <p>\"It's been pretty positive,\" John says. \"You go on courses like anger and stress management and you feel they actually understand what you're going through. Gradually you become less angry and more at ease with yourself. You end up with a better understanding of your condition.\" </p> <p>John is not \"cured\" in the sense that you can heal a physical ailment, but he has his problems more under control. \"The flashbacks aren't as destructive now because I understand them better,\" he says. \"I know what triggers to avoid - I don't go to the pub any more, for example - and, when they do happen, I know I'm not back in 1982. I realise it's 2001. </p> <p>\"I've talked to some of the old and bold from world war two and they still suffer but live with it. You've got to take what little positive there is. We've got an obligation to live a decent life for those who died - not just the British but also the Argentinians that some of us killed. </p> <p>\"It'd be too easy to go through life angry and cynical.

Mr Berlusconi has been ramming home populist campaign themes: huge public work projects, lower taxes, less red tape, safer streets, 1.5m new jobs. Italy would accelerate from a laggard to a leader in Europe under a renewal inspired by Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, he has said. Voters have not been told how he will rein in pensions and public spending to meet euro-zone rules.",

The recommendations, which may include the acreage of landholdings and financial interests of friends, come from a group chaired by the attorney general Lord Williams. The two Conservatives on the six strong group, Lord Elton and Lord Kingsland, protested that parts of the proposed code of conduct were \"disproportionately intrusive, failing to strike an appropriate balance between what is legitimately made public, to reinforce public confidence, and what is legitimately private\". Critics claim the register will change the character of the upper house, where peers have been expected to act on their honour. But the Labour peer Lord Lipsey said: \"What have the Tory peers got to hide ? The Tories' insistence that landholdings need not be declared gives the game away.\" The present Lords register is voluntary and does not suggest that peers should reveal their fees as parliamentary lobbyists, a key proposal of the Williams group. The proposals, including a code of conduct, follow recommendations of the Neill committee into standards of conduct in public life. Peers will be required to register any parliamentary consultancy, including fee, employment as a parliamentary lobbyist, renumerated directorships, regular paid employment, shareholdings amounting to a controlling interest and provision of research assistance from an outside body. Other disclosable interests may be shareholdings, landholdings and financial interests of a friend or relative. The leader of the Lords, Lady Jay, said yesterday: \"We feel if you have got a situation where local councillors and other members of public bodies are required to make a formal declaration of their interests, that it was something of an anomaly that the House of Lords code was voluntary.\" Lord Williams suggested that on issues such as leasehold reform and the right to roam, there was a strong case for peers disclosing their landholdings. He said: \"I would expect people to put acreage down. These things are not deep secrets\". Defending the suggestion that peers reveal the relevant financial interests of friends, Lord Williams said: \"If you had a close friend who had a vast shareholding or a vast interest, most people would regard that as relevant when you spoke. \"If you had someone who owned an enormous chunk of an oilfield, and you had a close relationship with him, would it not be reasonable for the public to know about this?

On Tuesday morning, the marketing consultant was in the middle of his weekly coach ride to London from Ilchester when a friend rang panicking that the new Mangiare restaurant he was opening in central London yesterday might get looted. Sean jokily suggested getting people in Mangiare T-shirts to hand out pizza to the protesters, because \"if you're feeding them, they won't smash the shop up\".</p> <p>Had he noticed the weaselly Scottish woman leaving the seat behind him to sneak off to the loo, mobile in hand, he might have been less startled when the coach was boarded on arrival in London by two PCs shouting \"where's number 64? Where's number 64?\" Sean was marched off the bus to find a third copper in plain clothes videoing him as he was lengthily questioned about alleged anarchist involvement until eventually being released. Well done the Met for a lesson in husbanding stretched resources and good old-fashioned common sense!</p> <p>\u0095 The transcript of Stupidest MP frontrunner David Lock's attempts to bully the Midlands free sheet For You has arrived, and splendid it is. For now, though, while we try to persuade the junior minister to enter a residential anger management course under Diary supervision, we are holding it back. If he refuses, however, gems such as \"I am a barrister and I'm going to show you the full force of the law\" will feature tomorrow.</p> <p>\u0095 The faux naif prattling of Lord Taylor (for God's sake, what kind of party did the man think he was joining?) makes us wonder if, as a one-time Tory candidate himself, he ever read the Tory Reform Group's Leadership for the Nation: Selecting Conservative Parliamentary Candidates. This relates that the weekend selection course all candidates must pass is \"modelled on the British army's officer selection course as it was in 1978... itself lifted from the Nazi party which devised the original concept in the 1930's as a method of selecting its cadres\". So Mr Townend and his mates were pretty much personally chosen by Hitler. Now let that be an end to it.</p> <p>\u0095 Thanks to Sandy Ross, the MD of Scottish Television, for background on the picture of Robin Cook on a horse. Sandy was Cookie's agent when he stood for the safe Tory seat of Edinburgh North held by the then Earl of Dalkeith (later Duke of Buccleuch), and the stunt was devised to satirise the then Earl's preference for riding to hounds over addressing the problem of appalling tenements. \"The woman (Miss Elizabeth Hop) was MP George Foulkes' girlfriend,\" Sandy writes, \"and is now George's wife and the Labour provost of Ayr. The Earl of Dalkeith won handsomely. Robin became obsessed with horses. Robin went on to win Edinburgh central in 1974.\" And the rest is Turncoat history.</p> <p>\u0095 At the DETR, security guards have refused environment minister Michael Meacher entry because he didn't have his pass. They should watch themselves with him next time. If Michael gets really cross, he'll buy the building and turn it into 128 luxury self-contained flats.</p> <p>\u0095 Surveillance: Boris the Jackal Johnson, subject of yesterday's surveillance for heckling Mr Tony during the Trafalgar Square concert, at the pre-concert reception in South Africa House for anti-apartheid campaigners, loudly assuring all he met \"I am a total impostor\". Was this the beginning of a cunning campaign to usurp Polly Portillo as new pin-up boy of the Tory centre-left? If so, let us hope gatecrashing South Africa was an end to it, and that there is nothing in rumours that a tall blond man with a peroxide floor mop on his head, shouting \"cripes gadzooks, strike me pink!\", was nicked near Oxford Street yesterday while offering pizza to undercover cops.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 This year it would be a nice change if liberals and sneerers stopped moaning about heavy-handed May Day policing. It just isn't so, as Sean Dromgoole rings to point out. On Tuesday morning, the marketing consultant was in the middle of his weekly coach ride to London from Ilchester when a friend rang panicking that the new Mangiare restaurant he was opening in central London yesterday might get looted. Sean jokily suggested getting people in Mangiare T-shirts to hand out pizza to the protesters, because \"if you're feeding them, they won't smash the shop up\". Had he noticed the weaselly Scottish woman leaving the seat behind him to sneak off to the loo, mobile in hand, he might have been less startled when the coach was boarded on arrival in London by two PCs shouting \"where's number 64? Where's number 64?\" Sean was marched off the bus to find a third copper in plain clothes videoing him as he was lengthily questioned about alleged anarchist involvement until eventually being released. Well done the Met for a lesson in husbanding stretched resources and good old-fashioned common sense! \u0095 The transcript of Stupidest MP frontrunner David Lock's attempts to bully the Midlands free sheet For You has arrived, and splendid it is. For now, though, while we try to persuade the junior minister to enter a residential anger management course under Diary supervision, we are holding it back. If he refuses, however, gems such as \"I am a barrister and I'm going to show you the full force of the law\" will feature tomorrow. \u0095 The faux naif prattling of Lord Taylor (for God's sake, what kind of party did the man think he was joining?) makes us wonder if, as a one-time Tory candidate himself, he ever read the Tory Reform Group's Leadership for the Nation: Selecting Conservative Parliamentary Candidates. This relates that the weekend selection course all candidates must pass is \"modelled on the British army's officer selection course as it was in 1978... itself lifted from the Nazi party which devised the original concept in the 1930's as a method of selecting its cadres\". So Mr Townend and his mates were pretty much personally chosen by Hitler. Now let that be an end to it. \u0095 Thanks to Sandy Ross, the MD of Scottish Television, for background on the picture of Robin Cook on a horse. Sandy was Cookie's agent when he stood for the safe Tory seat of Edinburgh North held by the then Earl of Dalkeith (later Duke of Buccleuch), and the stunt was devised to satirise the then Earl's preference for riding to hounds over addressing the problem of appalling tenements. \"The woman (Miss Elizabeth Hop) was MP George Foulkes' girlfriend,\" Sandy writes, \"and is now George's wife and the Labour provost of Ayr. The Earl of Dalkeith won handsomely. Robin became obsessed with horses. Robin went on to win Edinburgh central in 1974.\" And the rest is Turncoat history. \u0095 At the DETR, security guards have refused environment minister Michael Meacher entry because he didn't have his pass. They should watch themselves with him next time. If Michael gets really cross, he'll buy the building and turn it into 128 luxury self-contained flats. \u0095 Surveillance: Boris the Jackal Johnson, subject of yesterday's surveillance for heckling Mr Tony during the Trafalgar Square concert, at the pre-concert reception in South Africa House for anti-apartheid campaigners, loudly assuring all he met \"I am a total impostor\". Was this the beginning of a cunning campaign to usurp Polly Portillo as new pin-up boy of the Tory centre-left? If so, let us hope gatecrashing South Africa was an end to it, and that there is nothing in rumours that a tall blond man with a peroxide floor mop on his head, shouting \"cripes gadzooks, strike me pink!\", was nicked near Oxford Street yesterday while offering pizza to undercover cops. diary@theguardian.com",

Alan Milburn, the health secretary, signalled a radical devolution in the NHS. But the prime minister, in a speech billed as helping councils raise the quality of life, merely promised to let them keep the proceeds from fines for dropping litter or letting dogs foul pavements. </p> <p>First the good news. Alan Milburn sounded like a true convert. He returned again and again to the need to shift money and decision-taking from the centre to the frontline if the 10-year health plan is to work. </p> <p>This was the same Alan Milburn who, only a year ago, was promising personally to sack under-performing managers and send in hit squads to under-performing units, and who had so little faith in NHS staff that he took special powers to \"direct\" where the extra \u00a3600m allocated to health in the budget should be spent. </p> <p>Now he speaks of staff feeling \"disempowered or, worse, disillusioned\", of creeping centralisation that had crowded out local innovation, of frontline staff needing to be \"the architects of public service reform\" if they are to be its ambassadors. Every hospital, health centre and GP surgery should get a copy of the speech and frame its many key devolution quotes. </p> <p>The prime minister was more disappointing. He has never tried to hide his many criticisms of local councils. Indeed, he set them out in a pamphlet - the first on local councils by a serving prime minister - accusing them of inconsistent standards, poor decision making processes, low turn-outs. But last week was billed as something different. </p> <p>Blair began on the same theme as Milburn: the need for local people and local government to be in the vanguard. But what he was talking about were clean streets and public spaces. He went on: \"These issues may strike some as trivial but they are anything but trivial. They matter to people.\" </p> <p>True. But the people are also concerned about central controls. Labour abolished capping and compulsory competitive tendering (CCT). Yet selective capping powers remain, as does the right to withdraw subsidies from excessive spenders. Business rates, nationalised in 1990, still go to the treasury. All that was on offer was a supplementary business rate on a voluntary basis. </p> <p>No other country is quite so centralised. Local councils now raise only 20% of their spending. Adding in national services (police, health, benefits) shows why 96% of tax is centrally raised. Certainly high minimum standards, to avoid post-code variations, are needed. But let's leave room for some divergence.</p>",

This was the same Alan Milburn who, only a year ago, was promising personally to sack under-performing managers and send in hit squads to under-performing units, and who had so little faith in NHS staff that he took special powers to \"direct\" where the extra \u00a3600m allocated to health in the budget should be spent. Now he speaks of staff feeling \"disempowered or, worse, disillusioned\", of creeping centralisation that had crowded out local innovation, of frontline staff needing to be \"the architects of public service reform\" if they are to be its ambassadors. Every hospital, health centre and GP surgery should get a copy of the speech and frame its many key devolution quotes. The prime minister was more disappointing. He has never tried to hide his many criticisms of local councils. Indeed, he set them out in a pamphlet - the first on local councils by a serving prime minister - accusing them of inconsistent standards, poor decision making processes, low turn-outs. But last week was billed as something different. Blair began on the same theme as Milburn: the need for local people and local government to be in the vanguard. But what he was talking about were clean streets and public spaces. He went on: \"These issues may strike some as trivial but they are anything but trivial. They matter to people.\" True. But the people are also concerned about central controls. Labour abolished capping and compulsory competitive tendering (CCT). Yet selective capping powers remain, as does the right to withdraw subsidies from excessive spenders. Business rates, nationalised in 1990, still go to the treasury. All that was on offer was a supplementary business rate on a voluntary basis. No other country is quite so centralised. Local councils now raise only 20% of their spending. Adding in national services (police, health, benefits) shows why 96% of tax is centrally raised. Certainly high minimum standards, to avoid post-code variations, are needed. But let's leave room for some divergence.",

It was here in late 1999 that Sean, Joseph and Michael McCann - when they were 16, 15 and 13 - became subjects of one of the government's first anti-social behaviour orders. </p> <p>The McCanns' home has since been bulldozed, but other impoverished terrace houses and flats remain - some lived in, some burnt out. Security cameras monitor residents' every move and a walkway has been boarded up by the council in an effort to prevent crime. This area of east Manchester has been described by Brian Robson, director of Manchester University's urban policy studies centre, as \"land of the forgotten\". </p> <p>Anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) were introduced by the government in April 1999 as a flagship of home secretary Jack Straw's law and order programme. Local authorities and chief police officers, acting in consultation, may apply to a magistrates' court for what is in effect a banning order, protecting the community from a named individual alleged to cause harassment, alarm or distress to others. </p> <p>The order, issued under the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act, involves civil proceedings, with a case needing to be proved only according to the rules of civil evidence; the burden of proof is less than demanded by criminal cases. Hearsay evidence is acceptable, as it is so difficult to persuade witnesses to appear. Yet a breach of an order is a criminal offence, the penalty for which may be anything up to a five-year jail sentence. </p> <p>Gillian Crossley, the McCanns' solicitor, argues that Asbos should have been set wholly within the criminal justice context. Indeed, she is taking the case to appeal on this point. \"I do not think it was a very well thought through piece of legislation,\" she says. \"It is silent on standards of proof and I think it was naive to consider that these orders would be dealt with by duty solicitors in a five-minute hearing.\" </p> <p>\"By their very nature, they are not dealing with nice, compliant and friendly people with respect for authority. They are dealing with people with an inbred distrust of authority who are more likely to say no than yes\". </p> <p>The order against the McCanns has anyway proved counter-productive, Crossley claims. \"To some people, they achieved enormous notoriety and gained hero status, and to the ordinary population they were seen as the scum of the earth,\" she says. \"The family was marginalised and the order caused more trouble for them.\" </p> <p>The family, one generation removed from travellers, has been divided by the order, she says. Forced to move away, the boys have been unable to maintain links with relatives who still live in Beswick. </p> <p>Debate over the rights and wrongs of Asbos has been inflamed by an allegation by Straw that solicitors who challenge the orders are out to make money. He told a conference: \"Very aggressive defence lawyers sometimes forget about their wider social responsibilities and their responsibilities to the court, and, in trying to protect their niche markets with the local criminal fraternity, act in a way which would have been unacceptable when I was practising [as a barrister] 25 years ago.\" </p> <p>Crossley says she does not understand the basis for the minister's outburst. More important, she contends, is that Asbos have made no difference to the crime rate in Beswick. Superintendent Dave Thompson, of Grey Mare Lane police station in the heart of the estate, disagrees profoundly. He says that since the orders were introduced, crime has fallen by a third and burglaries by half. </p> <p>Takings at the local supermarket increased \u00a314,000 a week when the boys were banned, says Thompson. \"At the time when we obtained the order, there was a feeling that anything went round here,\" he says. \"A lot of people had lost confidence in the police and there was a perception that they [the McCanns] were untouchable. The three boys caused an enormous amount of problems for local people and committed a range of anti-social behaviour. And because residents were so scared of them, they were not willing to go to court.\" </p> <p> In the McCanns' case, there was no mediation and no attempt to sort out their problems prior to use of the Asbo. Since then, however, there has been a subtle change and orders are now regarded locally as a last resort for dealing with similar cases. Thompson says: \"We don't just want to beat them over the head with the orders; we're trying to explore the support systems that can be kicked in.\" </p> <p>Frank Whiteley, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, reckons Asbos have been relatively successful, but concedes that there have been teething troubles. He says the association believes the orders are not a single answer to anti-social behaviour, but part of a bigger tool kit. </p> <p>\"We have never looked at Asbos on their own,\" Whiteley says. \"But we have looked at the wider strategies and we have had some good successes.\" Orders can be used as part of an inter-agency approach involving mediation, injunctions and bail, but by themselves they are not a complete solution. \"We are cautiously optimistic about their success so far.\" </p> <p>The Home Office acknowledges that take-up of Asbos has varied across the country. More than 160 orders have been issued, including at least 50 against under-18s, but figures range from 18 in London and 15 in the West Midlands to just one each in Thames Valley, Leicestershire and south Wales. \"There is some anecdotal evidence that the threat of an Asbo is often sufficient,\" says a spokeswoman. \"We should not just judge it as a policy by numbers.\"</p> <p><strong>Ten years as an outcast</strong></p> <p>A 15-year-old Manchester youth last week received what is believed to be the longest anti-social behaviour order so far issued.

      "body": "<p>The government has recognised the crucial role of childminders by putting them at the heart of its national childcare strategy. But research published today indicates the scale of the challenge in their recruitment and retention. </p> <p>Official statistics show that the number of registered childminders in England fell almost 30% from 106,000 in 1992 to 76,000 last year. The new study, Who Cares? - Childminding in the 1990s, points to low pay, poor status of the job, an increase in regulation, lack of support from local authorities, demographic change and the growing availability of more flexible working hours in alternative employment. </p> <p>Researchers surveyed a sample of 1,050 childminders in eight English local authorities in January 1999. They also interviewed 10 new, 10 established and 10 former childminders from a city and a suburban English authority in 2000. Parents using the 20 active childminders were also interviewed. </p> <p>The study, conducted by the Thomas Coram Research Unit at London University's Institute of Education and funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, concludes that childminders are the main providers of formal childcare - accounting for some 25% of all children receiving non-parental care. The majority are women with young children of their own and a partner in full-time employment. </p> <p>A lack of any career progression and an expectation that the job will not be recognised in the wider labour market were found to be deterrents to working as a childminder. And the work can be uncertain. When care arrangements change, or end, childminders may have no idea when they will find new clients. As one interviewee said: \"I wish the general public would recognise that childminding is a proper job.\" </p> <p>Childminders were found to work an average 34 hours a week, with one in three doing more than 41. The average weekly income was \u00a3103. Half had vacancies for children and many reported difficulty filling places. </p> <p>Despite all this, interviewees expressed a high level of job satisfaction. The ability to combine paid work with being at home was seen as the main advantage. More than half wanted to continue childminding. </p> <p>The researchers warn that low levels of training and pay, and devaluation of the work, are making childminding unsustainable. \"This government has realised the value of childminding, but in wider society childminding is seen as something women do for 'pin money',\" says Ann Mooney, a researcher at the Thomas Coram research unit and co-author of the study. \"This is not how the women interviewed saw it. Most said the money earned from childminding was essential to their household income and the majority said that they would have to look for other work if they weren't childminding.\" </p> <p>Mooney acknowledges that new government initiatives have addressed some of the reasons for the decline in childminders. \"Never theless,\" she says, \"there are still underlying difficulties around status and working conditions. For childcare workers, it is a professional job.\" </p> <p>Gill Haynes, chief executive of the National Childminding Association and a member of the research project's steering group, says the organisation alerted the government to the decline in the number of childminders more than two years ago. Introduction of start-up grants of \u00a3300-\u00a3600, and early years development and childcare partnerships which provide support and advice to childminders, have created a \"dramatic\" rise in the organisation's membership. \"It has finally been recognised that childminders are self-employed and that we've got an army of female entrepeneurs out there,\" she says. </p> <p>Haynes also welcomes new national standards which, from September, will replace all current local authority guidelines and will require newly registered childminders to attend a recognised introductory course within six months of starting work. The course will count as the first unit of a nationally accredited qualification. And, from the autumn, schools inspectorate Ofsted will extend its remit to childminders. \"For the first time, standards will focus on how effectively childminders are providing care,\" Haynes says. \"They will be treated as experts rather than gifted amateurs.\" </p> <p>The association admits recruitment and retention are still problems. \"Local authorities have been poor at recognising the value of what childminders do. Many are looking after children with special needs and still being paid \u00a32.50 an hour. An authority should at least pay the minimum wage rather than exploit their goodwill and expertise.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Who Cares? - Childminding in the 1990s is available at \u00a313.95 plus \u00a32 p&amp;p from York Publishing Services, 64 Hallfield Road, York YO31 7ZQ (01904-430033).

      "bodyText": "The government has recognised the crucial role of childminders by putting them at the heart of its national childcare strategy. But research published today indicates the scale of the challenge in their recruitment and retention. Official statistics show that the number of registered childminders in England fell almost 30% from 106,000 in 1992 to 76,000 last year. The new study, Who Cares? - Childminding in the 1990s, points to low pay, poor status of the job, an increase in regulation, lack of support from local authorities, demographic change and the growing availability of more flexible working hours in alternative employment. Researchers surveyed a sample of 1,050 childminders in eight English local authorities in January 1999. They also interviewed 10 new, 10 established and 10 former childminders from a city and a suburban English authority in 2000. Parents using the 20 active childminders were also interviewed. The study, conducted by the Thomas Coram Research Unit at London University's Institute of Education and funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, concludes that childminders are the main providers of formal childcare - accounting for some 25% of all children receiving non-parental care. The majority are women with young children of their own and a partner in full-time employment. A lack of any career progression and an expectation that the job will not be recognised in the wider labour market were found to be deterrents to working as a childminder. And the work can be uncertain. When care arrangements change, or end, childminders may have no idea when they will find new clients. As one interviewee said: \"I wish the general public would recognise that childminding is a proper job.\" Childminders were found to work an average 34 hours a week, with one in three doing more than 41. The average weekly income was \u00a3103. Half had vacancies for children and many reported difficulty filling places. Despite all this, interviewees expressed a high level of job satisfaction. The ability to combine paid work with being at home was seen as the main advantage. More than half wanted to continue childminding. The researchers warn that low levels of training and pay, and devaluation of the work, are making childminding unsustainable. \"This government has realised the value of childminding, but in wider society childminding is seen as something women do for 'pin money',\" says Ann Mooney, a researcher at the Thomas Coram research unit and co-author of the study. \"This is not how the women interviewed saw it. Most said the money earned from childminding was essential to their household income and the majority said that they would have to look for other work if they weren't childminding.\" Mooney acknowledges that new government initiatives have addressed some of the reasons for the decline in childminders. \"Never theless,\" she says, \"there are still underlying difficulties around status and working conditions. For childcare workers, it is a professional job.\" Gill Haynes, chief executive of the National Childminding Association and a member of the research project's steering group, says the organisation alerted the government to the decline in the number of childminders more than two years ago. Introduction of start-up grants of \u00a3300-\u00a3600, and early years development and childcare partnerships which provide support and advice to childminders, have created a \"dramatic\" rise in the organisation's membership. \"It has finally been recognised that childminders are self-employed and that we've got an army of female entrepeneurs out there,\" she says. Haynes also welcomes new national standards which, from September, will replace all current local authority guidelines and will require newly registered childminders to attend a recognised introductory course within six months of starting work. The course will count as the first unit of a nationally accredited qualification. And, from the autumn, schools inspectorate Ofsted will extend its remit to childminders. \"For the first time, standards will focus on how effectively childminders are providing care,\" Haynes says. \"They will be treated as experts rather than gifted amateurs.\" The association admits recruitment and retention are still problems. \"Local authorities have been poor at recognising the value of what childminders do. Many are looking after children with special needs and still being paid \u00a32.50 an hour. An authority should at least pay the minimum wage rather than exploit their goodwill and expertise.\" \u0095 Who Cares? - Childminding in the 1990s is available at \u00a313.95 plus \u00a32 p&amp;p from York Publishing Services, 64 Hallfield Road, York YO31 7ZQ (01904-430033).

With neither of us yet out of our 20s, maybe we didn't know what we were doing. And, thinking back, we were given little information on which to base the decision. </p> <p>We knew Fiona had lived in a children's home for several years, that she had two natural brothers and that her mother had died when she was still a baby. What we didn't know until much later was that she had had 14 foster homes by the time she was three, and that attempts to establish a relationship between her remarried father and his three children had been messy and unsuccessful. </p> <p>Knowing some of this might have prepared us better for the unnaturally good little girl who came to live with us, and the very angry teenager who left us abruptly five years later. </p> <p>Why did we do it? I'm not sure, although I know the story we told ourselves and the social workers who interviewed us, and who were so keenly interested in \"motivation\". We had both been sent to boarding schools - I because I was blind and that's what they did to blind kids in the 50s; my wife, Jo, because her Catholic family was run by four devout maiden aunts who didn't believe that Jo's convert mum was capable of bringing them up properly. We were both angry about our childhoods and, equating children's home with boarding schools, thought vaguely that we could stop the same thing happening to somebody else. On such half-baked notions are crucial life decisions based. </p> <p>Unusually, my blindness didn't seem to play much part in the decision about whether we would make suitable foster parents. I say unusually because at the time, and almost certainly still, there are as many stereotypical ideas in social services about the capacities of disabled people as anywhere else. I suspect that in my case the minor celebrity factor counteracted the disability factor: I was a local radio presenter. </p> <p>For her first three months with us, Fiona was ridiculously good. Her explanation now is simple. \"I was scared of being sent back,\" she says. \"What most of us wanted in the home was a real family which cared about us.\" But, unknown to us, the little angel at home was raising merry hell at school and in the neighbourhood. When reports started filtering back of bullying, bad language and rebelliousness, we were genuinely disbelieving. \"Not Fiona,\" we said. For a while, we convinced ourselves that because Fiona had suddenly fetched up in our locally well-known family, she was being picked on - by teachers as well as classmates and their parents - for the usual reason that she was different. I'm still sure this was an element in it, but we were soon to discover that Fiona was not playing by the rules of our nice, if a little unconventional, middle-class family and that she believed she was in a fight which she was damn well going to win. </p> <p>But this is far from the whole picture. True, when the honeymoon period ended, Fiona vented her spleen on us too. But the Fiona I got to know over the next five years was also affectionate, generous, spontaneous, articulate and increasingly self-sufficient. She was fiercely protective of our other children - rather too fiercely sometimes - and once she settled she was prepared to have a go at anything, joining the local army training corps, the swimming club and getting her own part-time job at 13. But underlying all this - and although I think she grew genuinely fond of us - she was as angry with us as she was with everyone else. </p> <p>Why? Well, I think I understand that a little better since we've been virtually forced to talk to each other about it in the making of a radio programme. What has emerged from Fiona's side is her sense of having a lack of space, almost of suffocation. As a family, we are intensely communicative. People are always being asked how they feel, what they want, what they think. Coming from a children's home, where the only choice was like it or lump it, Fiona was just not prepared for this. She says now that her worst nightmares were our family meetings, where the children were asked about their views on everything from the colour of their wallpaper to where they wanted to go on holiday. Throughout these, Fiona would sit mute and disconsolate, longing, I now know, for the anonymity of the children's home. </p> <p>From our side, and in spite of some good times with Fiona, we were beginning to buckle under her pressure to leave us. She now admits that, towards the end, she was deliberately pushing us to reject her. Her version of this is that she didn't think she was worth loving and that, if she behaved badly enough, we would stop trying. Despite that good old staple of psycho-babble, low self-esteem, I think there's a good deal in that, although a simpler truth is that she just wanted us to get off her case. </p> <p>It was bound to end in tears, and it did. Jo, taking the brunt of Fiona's angst, was reaching the end of her tether - one too many whining teachers, apoplectic parents, policemen at the door, and our increasing awareness that we now talked, ate and slept Fiona almost certainly to the detriment of our other children. In the end, I told social services we could not go on and they agreed that they would take her back into care - but they also said I must tell her that this was happening and when. I said that if I did, Fiona would run. They still insisted. After I told her - the hardest thing in my life I've had to do - Fiona ran. But she also phoned me at midnight to say that she was safe and staying with a friend. It was the first considerate thing she'd done in months - and a sign that there might still be a relationship to salvage. </p> <p>Should we have done it in the first place? A heart-stopping moment in the making of this programme, two decades after the event, was when Fiona said to me for the first time: \"I sometimes wonder whether it would have been better if you hadn't fostered me; if I had just stayed in the kids' home. Perhaps I would now have a better relationship with my natural brothers.\" </p> <p>Fiona is entitled to that doubt, and by both agreeing to do the programme we had given each other licence to say what we thought. Not unduly given to self-doubt, I prefer to examine the facts. Three years after our break-up, and after very intermittent contact, we received a letter from Fiona, then living in Glasgow. She said she had a problem. I sent what I hoped was a helpful and encouraging letter back, and a bit of cash. Three days later, the doorbell rang. Fiona had used the money to buy a single train ticket home. We've been in contact ever since. </p> <p>Fiona now has her own home, a good job and, in an interview conducted when I wasn't there, she says she loves us. Twenty-four years ago, when she first arrived, I would have settled for that. I hope she can.</p> <p><strong>Stability the key to good results</strong></p> <p>Two-thirds of children in local authority care are in foster homes. But almost one in five of all those in care has three or more placements in the course of a year. </p> <p>Of youngsters in care continuously for more than four years, fewer than half have spent at least the past 24 months in the same foster home.</p> <p>Ministers are trying to improve the stability of foster placements. They say that, on the whole, stability is associated with better outcomes. English councils have been set a target that no more than 16% of children in care should have three or more placements in a year.</p> <p>In 1999-2000, the average was 17.8%. Almost a fifth of councils were judged to have performed unacceptably poorly.</p> <p>The Department of Health says a placement is more likely to work if there is proper assessment of the child's needs and a good choice of foster carers. A 1990 survey found that 80% of women fosterers were aged 31-55, only one in eight had a child under five and just one in 20 was non-white. </p> <p>\u0095 Peter White is the BBC's disability affairs correspondent.

English councils have been set a target that no more than 16% of children in care should have three or more placements in a year. In 1999-2000, the average was 17.8%. Almost a fifth of councils were judged to have performed unacceptably poorly. The Department of Health says a placement is more likely to work if there is proper assessment of the child's needs and a good choice of foster carers. A 1990 survey found that 80% of women fosterers were aged 31-55, only one in eight had a child under five and just one in 20 was non-white. \u0095 Peter White is the BBC's disability affairs correspondent.

He was only 20 when, after three years' training on his local paper in Ellesmere Port, Merseyside, he set off with three friends in their blue Bedford van on a trip to the Himalayas. </p> <p>Their goal was to get to Nepal, go on a trek to Everest base camp, then drive back. But things didn't go according to plan. Their engine blew up in Turkey, delaying them for a month. Then they all contracted dysentery. And by the time they reached Katmandu, the capital of Nepal, the monsoon season had started, leaving them with the time and energy for only one day's walking. But that was by no means the end of the trouble. </p> <p>Exhausted but exhilarated, they set off on the return trip. In Iran, they were forced to stop overnight on the roadside between Teheran and Tabriz. Liverpool-born Dowling describes waking to a spectacular sunrise, but then realising that they were being bombarded with stones by two young robbers. </p> <p>\"I was sleeping in the luggage rack. As I tried to scramble down, I felt an enormous pain in my chest - as if a boulder had hit me.\" </p> <p>In fact, Dowling had been shot in the spine by a 2.2 handgun. He taps the middle of his chest where, 27 years later, the bullet is still lodged. \"There was no point in the doctors removing it,\" he says, \"as the damage had been done.\" </p> <p>Dowling was instantly paralysed from the chest down. The bullet had severed his spinal chord. </p> <p>\"The bullet was the size of my little fingernail, which apparently is the exact width of the spinal column,\" he smiles. \"It was a clean wound, with only the tiniest trickle of blood. My friend [who fully recovered] was shot in the head and was covered in blood, which was much more scary.\" </p> <p>He says he came to terms with his injury \"very quickly\", and feels lucky that he had completed his training as a journalist and could go back to work almost immediately. \"I think my friends and family suffered more mental anguish, watching my every move and facial expression, as I had to learn to adapt to life in a wheelchair. I always say that I came off the lightest.\" </p> <p>The following year, Dowling made a trip to Canada and the US, sneaking into American hospitals for Vietnam war veterans to use their toilet facilities because he knew they would be accessible. \"I had some amazing conversations with veterans, who couldn't believe how I'd got shot, or how I'd come over from England in my wheelchair.\" </p> <p>Two years after the shooting, he got a job with the Liverpool Daily Post &amp; Echo. \"I needed to advance my career in an accessible building. There were no such things as dropped kerbs or wheelchair ramps in the mid-1970s, but the Echo's offices were relatively OK.\" </p> <p>Determined not to be defined as a disabled journalist, he worked as a features sub-editor. But gradually he saw the potential for a column for disabled people. \"From a commercial point of view, I thought it would attract advertising, but there was also a need for the nitty-gritty practical information, where to get advice and products, a forum to help families like mine pick up the pieces. Charities had their own newsletters, but the number of people who subscribed to them was minimal. I felt that if we could create a regular section within the Echo, we could reach a lot more people, and also form good relationships and partnerships with organisations which could make opportunities for disabled people.\" </p> <p>I Can Do That started as a monthly column in the Liverpool Echo in 1983, its title taken from the catchphrase of the time - the unemployed Yosser Hughes's mantra in the seminal television drama Boys from the Blackstuff. The main criterion was to keep the tone positive, says Dowling. \"It's easy for people to walk away from someone in a wheelchair if they are moaning, so it has a deliberately light and newsy feel.\" </p> <p>The column went weekly in 1988 and has grown from strength to strength, supported by succcessive Echo editors. But in addition I Can Do That was also launched four years ago as a 24-page, stand-alone, two-monthly magazine with a circulation of 25,000, distributed to newsagents, health centres, local authorities, libraries and disability groups across Merseyside and north Wales. Trinity Mirror, the Echo's owners and the biggest publisher of provincial newspapers, is looking at replicating its success in other regions. </p> <p>\"It's so successful, I can't get any work done because people keep phoning me up,\" Dowling jokes. </p> <p>Earlier this year, I Can Do That racked up the latest in a long line of awards - the regional media prize in the Enabled awards run by disability charity Leonard Cheshire. \"Some disabled people disagree with the magazine's existence, on the grounds that it excludes them from the mainstream,\" Dowling says, \"but unfortunately there is nothing in the mainstream media that provides this service. I would love for there not to be a need, and maybe in 20 years that will be the case - but somehow I doubt it.\" </p> <p>As he celebrates 25 years at the Echo this year, the success of I Can Do That is a fitting tribute to his positive energy. The memory of the 1974 attack is crystal clear but he is not haunted by it. He has good memories of the trip up until that awful day and a happy life now with his wife and three sons. He and his three travelling companions are still friends. </p> <p>\"People ask me what life is like in a wheelchair, but I find it hard to think of the negative aspects,\" Dowling says. \"Of course there are obstacles, like not being able to play foot- ball with my sons, or not being able to reach things, but I can't expect the world to lower itself for me.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>There's an old joke that goes: \"What comes out of Cowes backwards? The Isle of Wight ferry.\" In a new twist, if the Isle of Wight County Press is to be believed, the ferry could soon be taking frail elderly people on a last trip to the mainland because of an acute shortage of care home beds on the island itself. </p> <p>The story is not just journalistic licence. Charles Waddicor, the island council's social services director, confirms the bed shortage problem and accepts that using mainland care homes has been mooted. But he says shipping vulnerable old folk to the mainland could kill them - which is why he is against doing it. He says: \"If you move frail, elderly people in this way, something like two-thirds will die within three months.\" </p> <p>The severity of the care home problem on the Isle of Wight serves as a microcosm of wider problems across much of southern England - and beyond. There have long been gripes from home owners about the levels of payment for state-funded residents, but there is no doubt that homes are now closing. According to the latest survey by market analyst Laing &amp; Buisson, 760 private and voluntary homes closed last year, with the loss of 16,200 places. A further 2,500 places were lost in local authority-run homes. Overall, the residential and nursing home sector suffered a net loss of 9,700 places. </p> <p>But who is really to blame? Local authorities, which administer the state funding, are often painted as the bad guys. Community care money is provided through the revenue support grant, but the allocation comes from the Department of Health. It has announced inflation-busting rises for the past five years, fuelling expectations among home owners. But they have received below-inflation fee increases from councils. </p> <p>The health department figures do stand up to scrutiny. Rises of 5.2%, 7.2%, 4.5%, 5.0% and 5.9% over the past five years of low inflation give credence to the claims of a 12% real terms increase in funding. But the Local Government Association (LGA), representing councils, has some figures of its own. Its recent survey of almost all the 150 social services authorities in England found they were due to overspend on social services by \u00a3205m. A staggering 85% of councils anticipated overspending. The figures suggested that while the money allocated by central government for personal social services under the standard spending assessment (SSA) had grown 11.2% since 1998, expenditure by councils had risen 14.2%. </p> <p>The elderly do not take top priority. The LGA survey found that 64% of the expected overspend was on children's services - hardly surprising as children are a much higher profile area of spending and much more expensive if things go wrong. The harsh reality is that the penalties for injuring or mistreating an elderly person are cheap compared to the penalties for similar neglect of a child. </p> <p>But the LGA did find that 21% of likely overspending was on the elderly. Mike O'Donnell, a member of the social services panel of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, says pressure on councils is growing in two ways. More elderly people need services and those already receiving them need more intensive support. The funding also covers those helped at home - the government's preferred option. A person receiving 10 hours' help at home might need just five extra hours - but that represents a 50% increase in the budget. \"You might get a 6.5% increase in SSA, but most councils will need to implement a significant cuts package just to balance the budget,\" O'Donnell says. If they are lucky, they can afford a 2% rise for care home operators. </p> <p>And councils fear things are about to get worse. The government gave them the gatekeeper role of deciding who needed community care in 1993. Before that, anyone who asked for it got it. Those people are still funded by the Department of Social Security (DSS), but at fees it fixes. In the south, these are significantly lower than council fees. From April next year, those people will transfer to council responsibility. The government has said it will give councils all the additional cash they need, but many are sceptical. </p> <p>On the Isle of Wight, the difference between the fees is stark. For residential homes, the council's average contract price is \u00a3221.28 a week, compared to the DSS average of \u00a3161.02. For the council, that will mean finding the \u00a360.26 difference for each of up to 186 residents each week - a potential annual cost of \u00a3582,835. </p> <p>For nursing homes, the difference is even greater. The council's average contract price is \u00a3368.65, compared to the DSS average of \u00a3227.98, making a difference of \u00a3140.67. The 26 existing elderly patients currently on DSS books could cost an extra \u00a3190,186. On top of that, the island has 187 other residents under age 65 on preserved DSS rates. Even taking into consideration any additional funding for all these patients from their own resources, the Isle of Wight could easily be facing additional costs of more than \u00a31m a year. </p> <p>Local authorities claim they simply cannot afford to spend any more on care home fees without further government funding. However, the Registered Nursing Homes Association (RNHA) maintains some councils pay more to their own homes, or to their preferred voluntary sector operators, than they do to private sector homes in the same area. </p> <p>Association chairman Frank Ursell says councils go out of their way to defend council or voluntary sector homes against competition from the private sector. Walsall council, he claims, recently put its homes out to tender but specifically excluded private sector bidders. The council chose not to comment on this to the Guardian. \"When I was at school, they used to call this hypocrisy,\" Ursell says. Councils cannot pass all the blame on to central government, he argues. \"It's poor husbandry of the money by local authorities, on top of poor allocation by the government.\" </p> <p>But homes are not only facing this spending squeeze. New standards being phased in from next April will ramp up the costs of running care businesses. </p> <p>The RNHA's chairman on the Isle of Wight is Kevin Dannett, owner of Springfield nursing home in Shanklin. One of the examples he gives is the new standard that doors used by wheelchair users must be 800mm wide. All his doors are 780mm wide. \"Am I going to have to spend my limited resources to make my doors an inch wider?\" he asks. If the 244 new standards are policed rigorously, many homes will face huge bills just to stay in business. </p> <p>Ursell is frank about the situation. Between them, he and his wife have paid just \u00a35,500 in income tax on profit from their home over the past four years - demonstrating how low the margins are. \"It has not only taken away my profit,\" he says, \"it has taken away my investment money.\" </p> <p>Almost all homes will have to turn to banks for investment cash. But banks, understandably, are not keen to lend money when they cannot see in creased revenue resulting. For homes that have to convert to meet new single occupancy and room size standards, conversion may mean reducing the number of residents - hardly good grounds for lending money. </p> <p>With high property prices in the south, banks point out that the value of the asset is often greater than the value of the business. \"If you get an accountant in, or a banker, and you do the sums, then you should probably just sell up and realise the value of your asset,\" admits O'Donnell. And for those home owners approaching retirement age, selling for cash is undoubtedly a much more attractive proposition than soldiering on. </p> <p>In the end, this appears to be the main reason homes are closing. The outcome will be fewer, larger home owners, but they will at least be in a better position to stand up to councils and demand more money - a fact not lost on Bupa, which, with 232 homes and 16,000 beds, is the private sector's largest player. </p> <p>Only a quarter of Bupa patients are self-funding; the rest receive state support. \"Local authorities are effectively a monopoly purchaser as against a fairly fragmented nursing home market,\" says Peter Ludford, Bupa's care home director. \"As more homes close, it will start to put us on a more equal footing. Our elderly deserve a reasonable standard of care and support - but someone's got to pay.\"</p>",

With high property prices in the south, banks point out that the value of the asset is often greater than the value of the business. \"If you get an accountant in, or a banker, and you do the sums, then you should probably just sell up and realise the value of your asset,\" admits O'Donnell. And for those home owners approaching retirement age, selling for cash is undoubtedly a much more attractive proposition than soldiering on. In the end, this appears to be the main reason homes are closing. The outcome will be fewer, larger home owners, but they will at least be in a better position to stand up to councils and demand more money - a fact not lost on Bupa, which, with 232 homes and 16,000 beds, is the private sector's largest player. Only a quarter of Bupa patients are self-funding; the rest receive state support. \"Local authorities are effectively a monopoly purchaser as against a fairly fragmented nursing home market,\" says Peter Ludford, Bupa's care home director. \"As more homes close, it will start to put us on a more equal footing. Our elderly deserve a reasonable standard of care and support - but someone's got to pay.\"",

      "body": "<p>It is almost 20 years since John shot the young Argentinian soldier but he can still see him, close up, in his mind's eye. \"He was probably around my age. Afterwards I searched him and it turned out he wasn't armed. He didn't surrender, so I did my job. He could have had a pistol or a grenade. I didn't even consider whether he was armed or not. I just reacted to seeing him and I shot him.\" </p> <p>John was 19 when he was sent to the Falklands. He had joined the Parachute Regiment two years earlier and had already had a tour of duty in Northern Ireland. But the Falklands came as a complete shock. </p> <p>\"I knew I was going to go to Northern Ireland, but I never thought I would ever go to war,\" he says. \"It turned out to be very inhuman, very alien. War is not a glorious thing and anyone who makes out it is is a fool.\" </p> <p>Now 38, John has spent the last 20 years trying to recover from his army experiences. Like soldiers in conflicts before, and after, the gruesome reality of killing people, seeing your friends - and even, as in John's case, your own brother - blown up or shot, was all too much for him. And for almost two decades, no one wanted to help. </p> <p>Linda Winn, clinical director of Combat Stress, the ex-services mental welfare society, says John's experience is typical. \"We help people aged from 19 to 95,\" she says. \"As long as people are psychologically robust enough, we take them. People may think that shell shock or flashbacks are only suffered by veterans of the world wars. But that's not true. We have a lot of younger people coming through now, from the Gulf, the Balkans and Northern Ireland.\" </p> <p>Combat Stress aims to help these men - and a few women - deal with their problems at its three residential centres in Surrey, Shropshire and Strathclyde. \"The people who come here are suffering from psychological injuries resulting from their service experience,\" says Winn of the 2,000 or so people Combat Stress helps annually. \"Quite often they're very angry and we try to give them a feeling of control. The sooner people can be referred, the more successful the treatment.\" </p> <p>Last month, an extreme case of what can happen to someone who was not helped made its way into the news. George Daley, 80, an ex-Royal Artillery private from the second world war, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He had been woken from a deep sleep by fireworks and thought he had returned to the battlefields of North Africa. When his 85-year-old neighbour appeared, he was convinced she was the enemy breaking into his home and he stabbed her. </p> <p>\"Flashbacks can last for seconds or hours,\" says Winn. \"And they can be triggered by so many things. They also have residual effects. Afterwards you feel disturbed and distraught. </p> <p>\"We have found that with ex-Far East prisoners of war, the flashbacks and nightmares are often so strong that they think people are talking to them in Japanese. Some attack their wives, thinking they are Japanese soldiers.\" </p> <p>John, too, felt out of control. \"When I returned from the Falklands, I wanted out of the army urgently,\" he says. \"I never wanted to be put in that situation again and I left about a year afterwards.\" The memories, however, have remained. </p> <p>\"I've got no concept of time when it comes to the Falklands.

      "bodyText": "It is almost 20 years since John shot the young Argentinian soldier but he can still see him, close up, in his mind's eye. \"He was probably around my age. Afterwards I searched him and it turned out he wasn't armed. He didn't surrender, so I did my job. He could have had a pistol or a grenade. I didn't even consider whether he was armed or not. I just reacted to seeing him and I shot him.\" John was 19 when he was sent to the Falklands. He had joined the Parachute Regiment two years earlier and had already had a tour of duty in Northern Ireland. But the Falklands came as a complete shock. \"I knew I was going to go to Northern Ireland, but I never thought I would ever go to war,\" he says. \"It turned out to be very inhuman, very alien. War is not a glorious thing and anyone who makes out it is is a fool.\" Now 38, John has spent the last 20 years trying to recover from his army experiences. Like soldiers in conflicts before, and after, the gruesome reality of killing people, seeing your friends - and even, as in John's case, your own brother - blown up or shot, was all too much for him. And for almost two decades, no one wanted to help. Linda Winn, clinical director of Combat Stress, the ex-services mental welfare society, says John's experience is typical. \"We help people aged from 19 to 95,\" she says. \"As long as people are psychologically robust enough, we take them. People may think that shell shock or flashbacks are only suffered by veterans of the world wars. But that's not true. We have a lot of younger people coming through now, from the Gulf, the Balkans and Northern Ireland.\" Combat Stress aims to help these men - and a few women - deal with their problems at its three residential centres in Surrey, Shropshire and Strathclyde. \"The people who come here are suffering from psychological injuries resulting from their service experience,\" says Winn of the 2,000 or so people Combat Stress helps annually. \"Quite often they're very angry and we try to give them a feeling of control. The sooner people can be referred, the more successful the treatment.\" Last month, an extreme case of what can happen to someone who was not helped made its way into the news. George Daley, 80, an ex-Royal Artillery private from the second world war, pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He had been woken from a deep sleep by fireworks and thought he had returned to the battlefields of North Africa. When his 85-year-old neighbour appeared, he was convinced she was the enemy breaking into his home and he stabbed her. \"Flashbacks can last for seconds or hours,\" says Winn. \"And they can be triggered by so many things. They also have residual effects. Afterwards you feel disturbed and distraught. \"We have found that with ex-Far East prisoners of war, the flashbacks and nightmares are often so strong that they think people are talking to them in Japanese. Some attack their wives, thinking they are Japanese soldiers.\" John, too, felt out of control. \"When I returned from the Falklands, I wanted out of the army urgently,\" he says. \"I never wanted to be put in that situation again and I left about a year afterwards.\" The memories, however, have remained. \"I've got no concept of time when it comes to the Falklands. It's all very blurred. I just know I left in April and came back in August. I get flashbacks and they're like a montage of events from Goose Green to Wireless Ridge, which were two weeks apart. I see them pretty much together. Goose Green was a bloody battle. It was very conventional. There was bayoneting and hand-to-hand combat.

But research published today indicates the scale of the challenge in their recruitment and retention. </p> <p>Official statistics show that the number of registered childminders in England fell almost 30% from 106,000 in 1992 to 76,000 last year. The new study, Who Cares? - Childminding in the 1990s, points to low pay, poor status of the job, an increase in regulation, lack of support from local authorities, demographic change and the growing availability of more flexible working hours in alternative employment. </p> <p>Researchers surveyed a sample of 1,050 childminders in eight English local authorities in January 1999. They also interviewed 10 new, 10 established and 10 former childminders from a city and a suburban English authority in 2000. Parents using the 20 active childminders were also interviewed. </p> <p>The study, conducted by the Thomas Coram Research Unit at London University's Institute of Education and funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, concludes that childminders are the main providers of formal childcare - accounting for some 25% of all children receiving non-parental care. The majority are women with young children of their own and a partner in full-time employment. </p> <p>A lack of any career progression and an expectation that the job will not be recognised in the wider labour market were found to be deterrents to working as a childminder. And the work can be uncertain. When care arrangements change, or end, childminders may have no idea when they will find new clients. As one interviewee said: \"I wish the general public would recognise that childminding is a proper job.\" </p> <p>Childminders were found to work an average 34 hours a week, with one in three doing more than 41. The average weekly income was \u00a3103. Half had vacancies for children and many reported difficulty filling places. </p> <p>Despite all this, interviewees expressed a high level of job satisfaction. The ability to combine paid work with being at home was seen as the main advantage. More than half wanted to continue childminding. </p> <p>The researchers warn that low levels of training and pay, and devaluation of the work, are making childminding unsustainable. \"This government has realised the value of childminding, but in wider society childminding is seen as something women do for 'pin money',\" says Ann Mooney, a researcher at the Thomas Coram research unit and co-author of the study. \"This is not how the women interviewed saw it. Most said the money earned from childminding was essential to their household income and the majority said that they would have to look for other work if they weren't childminding.\" </p> <p>Mooney acknowledges that new government initiatives have addressed some of the reasons for the decline in childminders. \"Never theless,\" she says, \"there are still underlying difficulties around status and working conditions. For childcare workers, it is a professional job.\" </p> <p>Gill Haynes, chief executive of the National Childminding Association and a member of the research project's steering group, says the organisation alerted the government to the decline in the number of childminders more than two years ago. Introduction of start-up grants of \u00a3300-\u00a3600, and early years development and childcare partnerships which provide support and advice to childminders, have created a \"dramatic\" rise in the organisation's membership. \"It has finally been recognised that childminders are self-employed and that we've got an army of female entrepeneurs out there,\" she says. </p> <p>Haynes also welcomes new national standards which, from September, will replace all current local authority guidelines and will require newly registered childminders to attend a recognised introductory course within six months of starting work. The course will count as the first unit of a nationally accredited qualification. And, from the autumn, schools inspectorate Ofsted will extend its remit to childminders. \"For the first time, standards will focus on how effectively childminders are providing care,\" Haynes says. \"They will be treated as experts rather than gifted amateurs.\" </p> <p>The association admits recruitment and retention are still problems. \"Local authorities have been poor at recognising the value of what childminders do.

      "body": "<p>Earth First! is dead, long live Earth First! Almost exactly 10 years ago, Earth First! UK, the enfant terrible of the British environmental movement, was born at the gates of Dungeness nuclear power station in Kent. There, on the sixth anniversary of the explosion at Chernobyl, 50 Sussex activists took the first steps to create a network based on informed rage rather than exhaustive research. Frustrated by the creeping corporatisation of the environmental movement, we were directly inspired by Earth First! in the US, the \"no compromise\" movement started 11 years earlier. </p> <p>It was a boom time for many British groups who were enjoying an unprecedented growth in supporters and income. Even Margaret Thatcher had declared herself \"green\", but our line was to be unashamedly unreasonable. We knew EF US's original hardline \"rednecks for wilderness\" attitude wouldn't appeal here, so we set out to build a group that combined radical action and social justice to protect Britain's few remaining natural places. </p> <p>The idea was to remind people that the Earth was not dying but being murdered, and that the murderers had names and addresses. If somebody was trying to rape and murder your mum, you wouldn't, we reasoned, write a letter to your MP about the issue - you'd physically intervene. </p> <p>We were proud to be angry. We wanted no office or paid staff. We thought groups should do more than write reports, lobby government and treat their supporters as fundraising lackeys. We didn't want to create yet another organisation that would turn into a professional elite dependant on raising money for its existence. We wanted something wilder, less governable and modelled on nature itself. </p> <p>When a network chooses to operate beyond the rule of law, it must have a moral framework to operate within if it is to avoid collapsing into chaos. So Earth First! UK tried to define its relationship to violence, property damage and the media. At the end of a gathering in Sussex, EF! adopted a strict non-violence code, decided that no form of property damage should be committed in its name and gave a series of interviews to the national press. </p> <p>Within two years, 50 Earth First! groups and hundreds of nomadic activists were using Gandhi-style civil disobedience on a scale unseen since the early 80s peace movement. In 1992, an evangelical Earth First! roadshow culminated in more than 600 activists occupying Liverpool docks in protest at the importation of rainforest timber. But it was only when Earth First! answered a call from the Twyford Down Association that it really began to find its niche. </p> <p>On December 10, 1992, Earth First! tasted its first blood when security guards physically and sexually assaulted activists at a camp it had established with a group of New Travellers known as the Dongas tribe. The 18 months of daily direct action that followed showed the gumption the green movement needed to drag itself out of its post Earth Summit hangover. </p> <p>And so it went on. To Solsbury Hill outside Bath, the M11 campaign in Wanstead, Newbury and other road protests. Across the country, EF! activists focused on every form of destructive development they could find, from new supermarkets to new housing and quarrying developments. </p> <p>In 1994, the Conservatives aimed to criminalise a whole array of activists and lifestyles with the criminal justice and public order bill. The broad coalition that was formed to defeat the bill lost the battle, but the alliances it created further invigorated Britain's direct action movement. By 1997, campaigns had helped defeat the largest road building programme Britain had seen. The success involved no multi-million pound budgets, green celebrities or impressive hardware - just a network of determined unpaid activists. </p> <p>When Labour cancelled the roads programme, the network was left unbalanced, surprised and ultimately without its central campaign. Many activists, weary after years of what was often literally trench warfare, moved on. Others used the victory to focus on more progressive campaigns, from land rights occupations to trying to reclaim urban spaces from the car. So it was that Reclaim the Streets was born. </p> <p>In the last few years, Earth First! activists have concentrated on GM crops and globalisation. But lately the lack of highly visible and destructive development projects has stemmed the flow into the movement of new activists with fresh anger and perspectives. A new wave of mass direct action has yet to be realised. </p> <p>Earth First!, it seems, is hiber nating and has some hard thinking and work to do. Much was achieved, but while the mainstream environmental movement has come to accept Earth First!'s means, it has never accepted its agenda. It may have mobilised thousands, but it has failed to stop the further corporatisation of the wider movement. </p> <p>Far from accepting that capitalism is intrinsically unsustainable, green pressure groups increasingly have used market-based strategies to campaign. Some even state they do not in principle oppose economic growth, let alone capitalism itself. </p> <p>But revolutions are not so much put down as destroyed from the inside. Last year's Mayday protests weren't just criticised by the media, Earth First! activists themselves were depressed at its outcome. </p> <p>At last year's gathering in Snowdonia, activists started to look at an issue they have long avoided - self-discipline. It's ironic that a movement that has thrived on its ability to be confrontational has often proved inept at confronting destructive personalities within its own ranks. </p> <p>From the beginning, Earth First! has been plagued by people more interested in \"me first\", or \"tea-by-the-campfire first\" rather than putting the Earth first. Anti-road camps towards the end of their heyday often became cliquey and unwelcoming. While new activists were put off, many seasoned ones, tired and penniless after years of voluntary activism, went to work for mainstream pressure groups. This \"brain drain\" should have provided opportunities for new activists to take lead roles. But without establishing the infrastructure to pass on skills, a vacuum has been created. </p> <p>So where now? If Earth First! is to survive in Britain it must learn to present radical green ideals without being sidetracked by loose cannons or media hysteria. But it must also go back to basics and rediscover what it used to do best - turn the threat of local development projects into political opportunities. </p> <p>The government's \u00a329bn road building programme will be a crucial test, if only because it threatens to wipe out Earth First!'s most visible political achievement, but also its own backyard, in the form of the proposed Hastings bypasses. The very place where Earth First! was started is now itself threatened. </p> <p>If symbolism means anything, Hastings is the line drawn in the sand at the collapse of the last government's road programme. It must not be crossed. Earth Firsters, wake up, dust off the climbing harnesses, padlocks and laptops. This time, for some us at least, it's going to get personal.</p> <p>\u0095 Jake Bowers is a Romani activist and freelance journalist. Jason Torrance is a network developer for Greenpeace UK.

      "bodyText": "Earth First! is dead, long live Earth First! Almost exactly 10 years ago, Earth First! UK, the enfant terrible of the British environmental movement, was born at the gates of Dungeness nuclear power station in Kent. There, on the sixth anniversary of the explosion at Chernobyl, 50 Sussex activists took the first steps to create a network based on informed rage rather than exhaustive research. Frustrated by the creeping corporatisation of the environmental movement, we were directly inspired by Earth First! in the US, the \"no compromise\" movement started 11 years earlier. It was a boom time for many British groups who were enjoying an unprecedented growth in supporters and income. Even Margaret Thatcher had declared herself \"green\", but our line was to be unashamedly unreasonable. We knew EF US's original hardline \"rednecks for wilderness\" attitude wouldn't appeal here, so we set out to build a group that combined radical action and social justice to protect Britain's few remaining natural places. The idea was to remind people that the Earth was not dying but being murdered, and that the murderers had names and addresses. If somebody was trying to rape and murder your mum, you wouldn't, we reasoned, write a letter to your MP about the issue - you'd physically intervene. We were proud to be angry. We wanted no office or paid staff. We thought groups should do more than write reports, lobby government and treat their supporters as fundraising lackeys. We didn't want to create yet another organisation that would turn into a professional elite dependant on raising money for its existence. We wanted something wilder, less governable and modelled on nature itself. When a network chooses to operate beyond the rule of law, it must have a moral framework to operate within if it is to avoid collapsing into chaos. So Earth First! UK tried to define its relationship to violence, property damage and the media. At the end of a gathering in Sussex, EF! adopted a strict non-violence code, decided that no form of property damage should be committed in its name and gave a series of interviews to the national press. Within two years, 50 Earth First! groups and hundreds of nomadic activists were using Gandhi-style civil disobedience on a scale unseen since the early 80s peace movement. In 1992, an evangelical Earth First! roadshow culminated in more than 600 activists occupying Liverpool docks in protest at the importation of rainforest timber. But it was only when Earth First! answered a call from the Twyford Down Association that it really began to find its niche. On December 10, 1992, Earth First! tasted its first blood when security guards physically and sexually assaulted activists at a camp it had established with a group of New Travellers known as the Dongas tribe. The 18 months of daily direct action that followed showed the gumption the green movement needed to drag itself out of its post Earth Summit hangover. And so it went on. To Solsbury Hill outside Bath, the M11 campaign in Wanstead, Newbury and other road protests. Across the country, EF! activists focused on every form of destructive development they could find, from new supermarkets to new housing and quarrying developments. In 1994, the Conservatives aimed to criminalise a whole array of activists and lifestyles with the criminal justice and public order bill. The broad coalition that was formed to defeat the bill lost the battle, but the alliances it created further invigorated Britain's direct action movement. By 1997, campaigns had helped defeat the largest road building programme Britain had seen. The success involved no multi-million pound budgets, green celebrities or impressive hardware - just a network of determined unpaid activists. When Labour cancelled the roads programme, the network was left unbalanced, surprised and ultimately without its central campaign. Many activists, weary after years of what was often literally trench warfare, moved on. Others used the victory to focus on more progressive campaigns, from land rights occupations to trying to reclaim urban spaces from the car. So it was that Reclaim the Streets was born. In the last few years, Earth First! activists have concentrated on GM crops and globalisation. But lately the lack of highly visible and destructive development projects has stemmed the flow into the movement of new activists with fresh anger and perspectives. A new wave of mass direct action has yet to be realised. Earth First!, it seems, is hiber nating and has some hard thinking and work to do. Much was achieved, but while the mainstream environmental movement has come to accept Earth First!'s means, it has never accepted its agenda. It may have mobilised thousands, but it has failed to stop the further corporatisation of the wider movement. Far from accepting that capitalism is intrinsically unsustainable, green pressure groups increasingly have used market-based strategies to campaign. Some even state they do not in principle oppose economic growth, let alone capitalism itself. But revolutions are not so much put down as destroyed from the inside. Last year's Mayday protests weren't just criticised by the media, Earth First! activists themselves were depressed at its outcome. At last year's gathering in Snowdonia, activists started to look at an issue they have long avoided - self-discipline. It's ironic that a movement that has thrived on its ability to be confrontational has often proved inept at confronting destructive personalities within its own ranks. From the beginning, Earth First! has been plagued by people more interested in \"me first\", or \"tea-by-the-campfire first\" rather than putting the Earth first. Anti-road camps towards the end of their heyday often became cliquey and unwelcoming. While new activists were put off, many seasoned ones, tired and penniless after years of voluntary activism, went to work for mainstream pressure groups. This \"brain drain\" should have provided opportunities for new activists to take lead roles. But without establishing the infrastructure to pass on skills, a vacuum has been created. So where now? If Earth First! is to survive in Britain it must learn to present radical green ideals without being sidetracked by loose cannons or media hysteria. But it must also go back to basics and rediscover what it used to do best - turn the threat of local development projects into political opportunities. The government's \u00a329bn road building programme will be a crucial test, if only because it threatens to wipe out Earth First!'s most visible political achievement, but also its own backyard, in the form of the proposed Hastings bypasses. The very place where Earth First! was started is now itself threatened. If symbolism means anything, Hastings is the line drawn in the sand at the collapse of the last government's road programme. It must not be crossed. Earth Firsters, wake up, dust off the climbing harnesses, padlocks and laptops. This time, for some us at least, it's going to get personal. \u0095 Jake Bowers is a Romani activist and freelance journalist. Jason Torrance is a network developer for Greenpeace UK.

      "body": "<p>There's an old joke that goes: \"What comes out of Cowes backwards? The Isle of Wight ferry.\" In a new twist, if the Isle of Wight County Press is to be believed, the ferry could soon be taking frail elderly people on a last trip to the mainland because of an acute shortage of care home beds on the island itself. </p> <p>The story is not just journalistic licence. Charles Waddicor, the island council's social services director, confirms the bed shortage problem and accepts that using mainland care homes has been mooted. But he says shipping vulnerable old folk to the mainland could kill them - which is why he is against doing it. He says: \"If you move frail, elderly people in this way, something like two-thirds will die within three months.\" </p> <p>The severity of the care home problem on the Isle of Wight serves as a microcosm of wider problems across much of southern England - and beyond. There have long been gripes from home owners about the levels of payment for state-funded residents, but there is no doubt that homes are now closing. According to the latest survey by market analyst Laing &amp; Buisson, 760 private and voluntary homes closed last year, with the loss of 16,200 places. A further 2,500 places were lost in local authority-run homes. Overall, the residential and nursing home sector suffered a net loss of 9,700 places. </p> <p>But who is really to blame? Local authorities, which administer the state funding, are often painted as the bad guys. Community care money is provided through the revenue support grant, but the allocation comes from the Department of Health. It has announced inflation-busting rises for the past five years, fuelling expectations among home owners. But they have received below-inflation fee increases from councils. </p> <p>The health department figures do stand up to scrutiny. Rises of 5.2%, 7.2%, 4.5%, 5.0% and 5.9% over the past five years of low inflation give credence to the claims of a 12% real terms increase in funding. But the Local Government Association (LGA), representing councils, has some figures of its own. Its recent survey of almost all the 150 social services authorities in England found they were due to overspend on social services by \u00a3205m. A staggering 85% of councils anticipated overspending. The figures suggested that while the money allocated by central government for personal social services under the standard spending assessment (SSA) had grown 11.2% since 1998, expenditure by councils had risen 14.2%. </p> <p>The elderly do not take top priority. The LGA survey found that 64% of the expected overspend was on children's services - hardly surprising as children are a much higher profile area of spending and much more expensive if things go wrong. The harsh reality is that the penalties for injuring or mistreating an elderly person are cheap compared to the penalties for similar neglect of a child. </p> <p>But the LGA did find that 21% of likely overspending was on the elderly. Mike O'Donnell, a member of the social services panel of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, says pressure on coun cils is growing in two ways. More elderly people need services and those already receiving them need more intensive support. The funding also covers those helped at home - the government's preferred option. A person receiving 10 hours' help at home might need just five extra hours - but that represents a 50% increase in the budget. \"You might get a 6.5% increase in SSA, but most councils will need to implement a significant cuts package just to balance the budget,\" O'Donnell says. If they are lucky, they can afford a 2% rise for care home operators. </p> <p>And councils fear things are about to get worse. The government gave them the gatekeeper role of deciding who needed community care in 1993. Before that, anyone who asked for it got it. Those people are still funded by the Department of Social Security (DSS), but at fees it fixes. In the south, these are significantly lower than council fees. From April next year, those people will transfer to council responsibility. The government has said it will give councils all the additional cash they need, but many are sceptical. </p> <p>On the Isle of Wight, the difference between the fees is stark. For residential homes, the council's average contract price is \u00a3221.28 a week, compared to the DSS average of \u00a3161.02. For the council, that will mean finding the \u00a360.26 difference for each of up to 186 residents each week - a potential annual cost of \u00a3582,835. </p> <p>For nursing homes, the difference is even greater. The council's average contract price is \u00a3368.65, compared to the DSS average of \u00a3227.98, making a difference of \u00a3140.67. The 26 existing elderly patients currently on DSS books could cost an extra \u00a3190,186. On top of that, the island has 187 other residents under age 65 on preserved DSS rates. Even taking into consideration any additional funding for all these patients from their own resources, the Isle of Wight could easily be facing additional costs of more than \u00a31m a year. </p> <p>Local authorities claim they simply cannot afford to spend any more on care home fees without further government funding. However, the Registered Nursing Homes Association (RNHA) maintains some councils pay more to their own homes, or to their preferred voluntary sector operators, than they do to private sector homes in the same area. </p> <p>Association chairman Frank Ursell says councils go out of their way to defend council or voluntary sector homes against competition from the private sector. Walsall council, he claims, recently put its homes out to tender but specifically excluded private sector bidders. The council chose not to comment on this to the Guardian. \"When I was at school, they used to call this hypocrisy,\" Ursell says. Councils cannot pass all the blame on to central government, he argues. \"It's poor husbandry of the money by local authorities, on top of poor allocation by the government.\" </p> <p>But homes are not only facing this spending squeeze. New standards being phased in from next April will ramp up the costs of running care businesses. </p> <p>The RNHA's chairman on the Isle of Wight is Kevin Dannett, owner of Springfield nursing home in Shanklin. One of the examples he gives is the new standard that doors used by wheelchair users must be 800mm wide. All his doors are 780mm wide. \"Am I going to have to spend my limited resources to make my doors an inch wider?\" he asks. If the 244 new standards are policed rigorously, many homes will face huge bills just to stay in business. </p> <p>Ursell is frank about the situation. Between them, he and his wife have paid just \u00a35,500 in income tax on profit from their home over the past four years - demonstrating how low the margins are. \"It has not only taken away my profit,\" he says, \"it has taken away my investment money.\" </p> <p>Almost all homes will have to turn to banks for investment cash. But banks, understandably, are not keen to lend money when they cannot see in creased revenue resulting. For homes which have to convert to meet new single occupancy and room size standards, conversion may mean reducing the number of residents - hardly good grounds for lending money. </p> <p>With high property prices in the south, banks point out that the value of the asset is often greater than the value of the business. \"If you get an accountant in, or a banker, and you do the sums, then you should probably just sell up and realise the value of your asset,\" admits O'Donnell. And for those home owners approaching retirement age, selling for cash is undoubtedly a much more attractive proposition than soldiering on. </p> <p>In the end, this appears to be the main reason homes are closing. The outcome will be fewer, larger home owners, but they will at least be in a better position to stand up to councils and demand more money - a fact not lost on Bupa, which, with 232 homes and 16,000 beds, is the private sector's largest player. </p> <p>Only a quarter of Bupa patients are self-funding; the rest receive state support. \"Local authorities are effectively a monopoly purchaser as against a fairly fragmented nursing home market,\" says Peter Ludford, Bupa's care home director. \"As more homes close, it will start to put us on a more equal footing. Our elderly deserve a reasonable standard of care and support - but someone's got to pay.\"</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.societytheguardian.com/longtermcare/\">Special report on care of the elderly</a>.</p>",

The 26 existing elderly patients currently on DSS books could cost an extra \u00a3190,186. On top of that, the island has 187 other residents under age 65 on preserved DSS rates. Even taking into consideration any additional funding for all these patients from their own resources, the Isle of Wight could easily be facing additional costs of more than \u00a31m a year. Local authorities claim they simply cannot afford to spend any more on care home fees without further government funding. However, the Registered Nursing Homes Association (RNHA) maintains some councils pay more to their own homes, or to their preferred voluntary sector operators, than they do to private sector homes in the same area. Association chairman Frank Ursell says councils go out of their way to defend council or voluntary sector homes against competition from the private sector. Walsall council, he claims, recently put its homes out to tender but specifically excluded private sector bidders. The council chose not to comment on this to the Guardian. \"When I was at school, they used to call this hypocrisy,\" Ursell says. Councils cannot pass all the blame on to central government, he argues. \"It's poor husbandry of the money by local authorities, on top of poor allocation by the government.\" But homes are not only facing this spending squeeze. New standards being phased in from next April will ramp up the costs of running care businesses. The RNHA's chairman on the Isle of Wight is Kevin Dannett, owner of Springfield nursing home in Shanklin. One of the examples he gives is the new standard that doors used by wheelchair users must be 800mm wide. All his doors are 780mm wide. \"Am I going to have to spend my limited resources to make my doors an inch wider?\" he asks. If the 244 new standards are policed rigorously, many homes will face huge bills just to stay in business. Ursell is frank about the situation. Between them, he and his wife have paid just \u00a35,500 in income tax on profit from their home over the past four years - demonstrating how low the margins are. \"It has not only taken away my profit,\" he says, \"it has taken away my investment money.\" Almost all homes will have to turn to banks for investment cash. But banks, understandably, are not keen to lend money when they cannot see in creased revenue resulting. For homes which have to convert to meet new single occupancy and room size standards, conversion may mean reducing the number of residents - hardly good grounds for lending money. With high property prices in the south, banks point out that the value of the asset is often greater than the value of the business. \"If you get an accountant in, or a banker, and you do the sums, then you should probably just sell up and realise the value of your asset,\" admits O'Donnell. And for those home owners approaching retirement age, selling for cash is undoubtedly a much more attractive proposition than soldiering on. In the end, this appears to be the main reason homes are closing. The outcome will be fewer, larger home owners, but they will at least be in a better position to stand up to councils and demand more money - a fact not lost on Bupa, which, with 232 homes and 16,000 beds, is the private sector's largest player. Only a quarter of Bupa patients are self-funding; the rest receive state support. \"Local authorities are effectively a monopoly purchaser as against a fairly fragmented nursing home market,\" says Peter Ludford, Bupa's care home director. \"As more homes close, it will start to put us on a more equal footing. Our elderly deserve a reasonable standard of care and support - but someone's got to pay.\" \u0095 Special report on care of the elderly.",

      "body": "<p>I escaped from the farm on Friday evening for a few hours. I received a spur-of-the-moment invitation to join a murder mystery evening at the golf club in Hexham. It was a real hoot and a welcome change to get off the farm and leave everything behind. But was it sheer coincidence that the character I played was named Beryl Sheep?</p> <p>There is still, after 10 exhausting weeks, no escape from the subject of foot and mouth. Even school homework, a list of spellings, brought us back to the topic. One of the words was assonance, and two of the words the dictionary lists to illustrate the definition of sound resemblance were \"killed\" and \"culled\". Culled used to be a farming term, yet is now in daily usage.</p> <p>Yesterday we rejoiced at a rare and absolutely brilliant morning, with the clearest of blue skies and wall-to-wall sunshine. It cheered us immensely but maddened the cattle: they bellowed all day, informing us that they wanted to be let out to the pastures. Some of the older cows banged on the huge metal doors in an effort to escape, but the doors held fast.</p> <p>Turning out the cattle will not be simple this year. Peter and I have almost fallen out over how best to deal with the mechanics of turnout - the logistics resulting from the strict foot and mouth restrictions are proving almost too much.</p> <p>First we need to reapply for a second occupational licence, which allows us to move animals around our single holding on a day-to-day basis. Our first one limited us to within 500m of the steading (farm buildings), which has meant a lot of crossing fields and other difficulties. The new occupational licences allow a longer distance to be covered within the same holding, which will help enormously.</p> <p>But nothing will save us from the pandemonium that ensues as soon as we open the cattle-shed doors. It is not just a rodeo, but more like Buffalo Bill's grand extravaganza, as the smell of fresh grass and the chance of freedom after almost seven months inside sends the beasts into a highly vocal, pounding frenzy. Normal practice is to block the road in the yard and down beside the field. The animals hurtle down the road, mooing loudly, to the field where they will stay for the next few weeks. This year we may have to put them in one field, across from the shed, let them calm down and try to move them again from field to field. This method could take days and days, and by the time the last ones are let out they will be even more frantic, having watched and heard their mates go out shed by shed.</p> <p>It is also a riskier operation as the chance of broken fences, walls and even legs increases every time we try to move them on. Unfortunately, our Limousin cross cattle have always been particularly hot-headed and despite their daily feeding and bedding throughout the long winter, they never seem to quieten. The slightest change in routine can set them off into a bucking and bolting session over which we are powerless - the foot and mouth regulations mean absolutely nothing to a beefy half-tonne bullock in full flight.</p> <p>We have posted our census form and the next hefty task in the paperwork department will be the annual IACS (integrated administrative control system) form listing all our land and forage hectares. The forage area refers to all the fields that can be grazed. We normally take this form to Carlisle to be checked, but this year it will have to be sent by recorded delivery. The deadline is May 15.</p> <p>Another of our neighbours has had an unwelcome scare. A phone call from the control room at Kenton Bar informed them of an inspection by a Maff vet. This was triggered by a coal lorry which came to them after previously calling at a farm confirmed later as infected premises. After a check, all was pronounced well.</p> <p>Peter is unloading the fertiliser from a lorry. We only use a small amount to encourage grass growth in the best fields and ensure we have sufficient hay and silage to last the winter.</p> <p>A final thought: a local vet thinks Phoenix the calf could not have lain outside for five days with her dead mother as she was in far too good a condition.

      "bodyText": "I escaped from the farm on Friday evening for a few hours. I received a spur-of-the-moment invitation to join a murder mystery evening at the golf club in Hexham. It was a real hoot and a welcome change to get off the farm and leave everything behind. But was it sheer coincidence that the character I played was named Beryl Sheep? There is still, after 10 exhausting weeks, no escape from the subject of foot and mouth. Even school homework, a list of spellings, brought us back to the topic. One of the words was assonance, and two of the words the dictionary lists to illustrate the definition of sound resemblance were \"killed\" and \"culled\". Culled used to be a farming term, yet is now in daily usage. Yesterday we rejoiced at a rare and absolutely brilliant morning, with the clearest of blue skies and wall-to-wall sunshine. It cheered us immensely but maddened the cattle: they bellowed all day, informing us that they wanted to be let out to the pastures. Some of the older cows banged on the huge metal doors in an effort to escape, but the doors held fast. Turning out the cattle will not be simple this year. Peter and I have almost fallen out over how best to deal with the mechanics of turnout - the logistics resulting from the strict foot and mouth restrictions are proving almost too much. First we need to reapply for a second occupational licence, which allows us to move animals around our single holding on a day-to-day basis. Our first one limited us to within 500m of the steading (farm buildings), which has meant a lot of crossing fields and other difficulties. The new occupational licences allow a longer distance to be covered within the same holding, which will help enormously. But nothing will save us from the pandemonium that ensues as soon as we open the cattle-shed doors. It is not just a rodeo, but more like Buffalo Bill's grand extravaganza, as the smell of fresh grass and the chance of freedom after almost seven months inside sends the beasts into a highly vocal, pounding frenzy. Normal practice is to block the road in the yard and down beside the field. The animals hurtle down the road, mooing loudly, to the field where they will stay for the next few weeks. This year we may have to put them in one field, across from the shed, let them calm down and try to move them again from field to field. This method could take days and days, and by the time the last ones are let out they will be even more frantic, having watched and heard their mates go out shed by shed. It is also a riskier operation as the chance of broken fences, walls and even legs increases every time we try to move them on. Unfortunately, our Limousin cross cattle have always been particularly hot-headed and despite their daily feeding and bedding throughout the long winter, they never seem to quieten. The slightest change in routine can set them off into a bucking and bolting session over which we are powerless - the foot and mouth regulations mean absolutely nothing to a beefy half-tonne bullock in full flight. We have posted our census form and the next hefty task in the paperwork department will be the annual IACS (integrated administrative control system) form listing all our land and forage hectares. The forage area refers to all the fields that can be grazed. We normally take this form to Carlisle to be checked, but this year it will have to be sent by recorded delivery. The deadline is May 15. Another of our neighbours has had an unwelcome scare. A phone call from the control room at Kenton Bar informed them of an inspection by a Maff vet. This was triggered by a coal lorry which came to them after previously calling at a farm confirmed later as infected premises. After a check, all was pronounced well. Peter is unloading the fertiliser from a lorry. We only use a small amount to encourage grass growth in the best fields and ensure we have sufficient hay and silage to last the winter. A final thought: a local vet thinks Phoenix the calf could not have lain outside for five days with her dead mother as she was in far too good a condition. He wonders if Phoenix was a set-up, or if she was simply hidden? She is very tame and takes her bottles of milk so sweetly. Most of us who have dealings with cattle know that few calves are so immediately amenable. \u0095 The next On the Farm will be on Friday.

      "body": "<p>On the Monday night in March when Camelot announced that somebody in Watford, or maybe St Albans, had failed to claim a jackpot worth \u00a33,011,065, 115 people rang the national lottery operator to say the prize was theirs. Mostly, they were the chancers the company's security department has come to expect whenever the 180-day deadline for unclaimed money draws close: the man who would still have the winning ticket if only his dog hadn't eaten it; the fraudsters who seem to think they can get their hands on the cash by just signing on a dotted line, no questions asked. </p> <p>But amid the usual flurry of calls, Martyn Tott's stood out. The 33-year-old purchasing manager had a particularly convincing tale, pinpointing the time the ticket was bought, the place - a small newsagents' in St Albans High Street - and enough circumstantial detail to persuade Martin Challis, Camelot's head of security, to drive the next day to the cramped first-floor Watford flat Tott shared with his 24-year-old wife Kay, a receptionist. There was only one problem; like all the others who called to claim the jackpot that night, Tott couldn't actually produce a ticket. </p> <p>Had they known what was to follow - an agonising seven-week switchback of positive and negative signals from Camelot; of paranoia and secret telephone recordings; of depression alternating with barely stifled ecstasy; all in a desperate attempt to prove they were entitled to the money - the Totts might not have bothered to make the call. But they did, and 12 days ago they finally discovered that they had failed: Camelot knew they had bought the ticket, they were told - but they wouldn't be getting their money. Rules, after all, are rules. </p> <p>\"That Monday in March,\" Martyn recalls, \"we got in from work and Kay wanted to watch a video, but I caught the newsreader on Newsroom South East say there was an item on an unclaimed jackpot in our area later in the programme.\" He called up Teletext, found the relevant page, and there on the screen were the winning numbers for the September 16 draw - their numbers: 6 and 7, their birthdays; 11 for the day they got engaged; 23 and 32 for their ages when they met; and 44, Martyn's grandmother's door number. \"Kay just screamed, jumped up and screamed, 'It's our numbers, it's our numbers.' But I immediately thought: we'll have thrown that ticket away. I just felt numb.\" </p> <p>Almost two months later, we are sitting in the impossibly plush bar of the impossibly lovely Lainston House Hotel, a luxurious country house retreat outside Winchester. Kay is present, but pleads exhaustion, so Martyn is doing most of the talking. Despite his protestation, he doesn't look at all tired, and is clearly excited by recounting his story. For a brief moment, the two had teetered on the brink of being Britain's Sorest Losers, but thanks to the intervention of Max Clifford PR and the Mirror (no money changed hands) they have been anointed Britain's Unluckiest Couple. </p> <p>This explains the expressions of celebrity support - everybody from Ulrika Jonsson to Great Train Robber Bruce Reynolds has spoken up in their support; Richard Branson has renewed his ongoing hostilities with Camelot by offering them a free holiday on his private island - and also why they are being put up at Lainston by the Mirror. \"This is the sort of thing we might have been doing if ...\" Martyn trails off. \"But even just to come here for a few days is lovely.\" </p> <p>But seven weeks ago, as the possibility of exchanging their \u00a334,000 annual joint income for a life of never having to think about annual joint incomes again flashed before them, things were rather more fraught. Despite Martyn's growing certainty that they had thrown the ticket away, the couple embarked on a microscopic hunt. \"We turned the flat upside down, took drawers out, went through personal papers, everything,\" he says. \"You know how sometimes you've got a cup where you put loads of pencils in? Things like that.\" While Kay went through their wardrobes, checking the linings of clothes, he clambered up to the loft to scrabble underneath the boards he had recently put down. And, for a moment, it looked as if the search was over. </p> <p>\"I found a bag in the corner of the loft, a carrier bag,\" he says. \"I thought there might be an old ticket in it, I suppose, so I took all the stuff out. And there was. There was a ticket at the bottom. I just sat there looking at the back of it for ages. It was like my heart stopped. But then I turned it over and it was from way, way back.\" It was the first of many emotional precipices over which the couple were to dangle in the folllowing weeks. </p> <p>Next day, he was combing through the garage and the shed - \"for three million pounds, what wouldn't you do?\" - when Challis arrived on their doorstep. \"I told him, 'I'm pleased to see you, I think,' like a joke, but he just stared at me,\" Martyn recalls. \"He said there was a rule that you can't claim for a lost ticket after 30 days. But then again, he said, 'If you hadn't given the details you gave, I wouldn't be here now.'\" </p> <p>It was the glimmer of hope they were yearning for. Challis swore them to secrecy. \"If there's no payment, he told us, you and Kay must never tell anyone. You'll never forget it, but you'll learn to live with it.\" Within a week, Martyn says, Camelot had carried out checks on ticket sales, confirming the couple's story that they bought 10 tickets in blocks every five weeks at Londis in St Albans - one ticket for each bi-weekly draw. \"They said they were 101% certain,\" Martyn says. But for a second week, nothing happened. </p> <p>Paranoia set in. The purchasing manager in Martyn took over and he started to treat the jackpot like an unpaid invoice, logging in detail his every fruitless call to Camelot. He borrowed telephone recording equipment from a friend under the guise of needing evidence for a mail-order dispute. \"I was thinking, 'Hang on - what proof have I got that any of this even took place? If this is just Camelot versus a disgruntled punter who says they lost their ticket, what chance have we got?'\" </p> <p>Then, finally, Challis called with a new request. Camelot needed proof that the couple were who they said they were: pay slips, utility bills, mortgage details, bank statements, wedding and birth certificates. \"I thought, well, this is intimidating - but why do all this if it wasn't pretty much sorted out? I thought Camelot had just told him, 'Go back and just be certain they're not fraudsters.'\" They were thrilled, convinced they were on the verge of winning. </p> <p>That weekend, they broke their self-imposed rules and allowed themselves to fantasise. In a dreamlike, near-hysterical state, they started to plan what to do with their millions. Of course, there would be lump sums for the family, and treatment for Martyn's father's arthritis, but there would also be luxuries. \"We're not the sort of people that would get a mansion and a Ferrari,\" Martyn says, \"but something with four or five bedrooms in a nice area, your average \u00a330,000 car, one of those new Audi TT Quatros?\" Giggling, they drove around Theydon Bois - \"where Rod Stewart lives\" - fantasising about houses costing \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>But then, agonisingly, nothing did happen: Camelot fell effectively silent for four weeks. Kay couldn't sleep; Martyn drank more than he usually did - nothing calamitous, just the indistinct chaos of a life on hold. They started to argue. \"We were starting to fray a bit,\" says Martyn. \"We were bickering all the time. One person would ask the other what they thought was going to happen next, but of course neither of us could answer that.\" Their parents, still in the dark, began to worry. \"They thought there was something wrong with out marriage, there was this atmosphere between us. It was all we could talk about between ourselves but we were desperate to tell someone.\" In the end they told their parents, swearing them to secrecy on Camelot's instructions. They kept on showing up at work as if nothing was out of the ordinary, and waited. </p> <p>It was a call from Challis, two Thursdays ago, that ended the waiting. Kay had a towel around her head, preparing to go out; Martyn was running a bath. But Challis was calling them from his car outside their house and wanted to come in, so Martyn set up his recording equipment in the kitchen in a hurry. \"He said he had bad news: rules is rules, and no exception can be made in this case,\" says Martyn. Camelot, Challis explained, had spent the last weeks \"legally testing\" the 30-day rule in consultation with the creators of the rules, the national lottery commission, and had concluded that their hands were tied. \"We were just stunned. We just sat there. Were they testing the rules, or testing our resilience not to crack up? Weaker people would have split up or, I don't want to say it, but someone could have done themselves in over this.\" </p> <p> Kay's anger returned quicker than Martyn's. \"Challis had a woman with him like a social worker, and all she kept saying was 'I understand, I understand.' This woman who I'd never seen before in my life was saying 'I understand' - I was just boiling up, I felt sick. I was shaking. I just told Martyn, 'Get them out of my house.'\" Martyn did not remain stunned for long. By the Monday morning, he was in Max Clifford's office in London. </p> <p>To the Totts, their experiences with Camelot and their subsequent public statements amount to nothing less than a fight for justice against the lottery's Kafkaesque bureaucracy. They reserve their strongest words for Challis, and for the \"30-day rule\" on lost tickets, which was not widely publicised when it was introduced in December 1997 to replace a rather more straightforward \"no ticket, no prize\" policy. \"We wanted the truth to get out, to say this is how Camelot behaved to us, and this is how they could behave to you,\" says Martyn. \"We want justice to be done.\" </p> <p>If it is difficult to take such grand claims at face value, it is equally hard not to feel sympathy. The Totts have been caught in the contradiction that makes the lottery function - the insistence that it's all just a bit of fun, a moment's relief from the daily grind, overlain with the unspoken riposte: yes, but it could change everything forever. </p> <p>It was the former thought that explained why they didn't check their ticket that week in September - \"after seven years, you just think well, I buy a ticket, but I'm never going to win a blooming thing\" - but it was the latter that got them hoping. \"It's not only about the money,\" says Kay. \"We were happy before, and we'll be happy again. But if they'd have told us that first night there'd be no money because we had no ticket, we'd have been gutted, but at least we could have got on with our lives.\"</p>",

The 33-year-old purchasing manager had a particularly convincing tale, pinpointing the time the ticket was bought, the place - a small newsagents' in St Albans High Street - and enough circumstantial detail to persuade Martin Challis, Camelot's head of security, to drive the next day to the cramped first-floor Watford flat Tott shared with his 24-year-old wife Kay, a receptionist. There was only one problem; like all the others who called to claim the jackpot that night, Tott couldn't actually produce a ticket. Had they known what was to follow - an agonising seven-week switchback of positive and negative signals from Camelot; of paranoia and secret telephone recordings; of depression alternating with barely stifled ecstasy; all in a desperate attempt to prove they were entitled to the money - the Totts might not have bothered to make the call. But they did, and 12 days ago they finally discovered that they had failed: Camelot knew they had bought the ticket, they were told - but they wouldn't be getting their money. Rules, after all, are rules. \"That Monday in March,\" Martyn recalls, \"we got in from work and Kay wanted to watch a video, but I caught the newsreader on Newsroom South East say there was an item on an unclaimed jackpot in our area later in the programme.\" He called up Teletext, found the relevant page, and there on the screen were the winning numbers for the September 16 draw - their numbers: 6 and 7, their birthdays; 11 for the day they got engaged; 23 and 32 for their ages when they met; and 44, Martyn's grandmother's door number. \"Kay just screamed, jumped up and screamed, 'It's our numbers, it's our numbers.' But I immediately thought: we'll have thrown that ticket away. I just felt numb.\" Almost two months later, we are sitting in the impossibly plush bar of the impossibly lovely Lainston House Hotel, a luxurious country house retreat outside Winchester. Kay is present, but pleads exhaustion, so Martyn is doing most of the talking. Despite his protestation, he doesn't look at all tired, and is clearly excited by recounting his story. For a brief moment, the two had teetered on the brink of being Britain's Sorest Losers, but thanks to the intervention of Max Clifford PR and the Mirror (no money changed hands) they have been anointed Britain's Unluckiest Couple. This explains the expressions of celebrity support - everybody from Ulrika Jonsson to Great Train Robber Bruce Reynolds has spoken up in their support; Richard Branson has renewed his ongoing hostilities with Camelot by offering them a free holiday on his private island - and also why they are being put up at Lainston by the Mirror. \"This is the sort of thing we might have been doing if ...\" Martyn trails off. \"But even just to come here for a few days is lovely.\" But seven weeks ago, as the possibility of exchanging their \u00a334,000 annual joint income for a life of never having to think about annual joint incomes again flashed before them, things were rather more fraught. Despite Martyn's growing certainty that they had thrown the ticket away, the couple embarked on a microscopic hunt. \"We turned the flat upside down, took drawers out, went through personal papers, everything,\" he says. \"You know how sometimes you've got a cup where you put loads of pencils in? Things like that.\" While Kay went through their wardrobes, checking the linings of clothes, he clambered up to the loft to scrabble underneath the boards he had recently put down. And, for a moment, it looked as if the search was over. \"I found a bag in the corner of the loft, a carrier bag,\" he says. \"I thought there might be an old ticket in it, I suppose, so I took all the stuff out. And there was. There was a ticket at the bottom. I just sat there looking at the back of it for ages. It was like my heart stopped. But then I turned it over and it was from way, way back.\" It was the first of many emotional precipices over which the couple were to dangle in the folllowing weeks. Next day, he was combing through the garage and the shed - \"for three million pounds, what wouldn't you do?\" - when Challis arrived on their doorstep. \"I told him, 'I'm pleased to see you, I think,' like a joke, but he just stared at me,\" Martyn recalls. \"He said there was a rule that you can't claim for a lost ticket after 30 days. But then again, he said, 'If you hadn't given the details you gave, I wouldn't be here now.'\" It was the glimmer of hope they were yearning for. Challis swore them to secrecy. \"If there's no payment, he told us, you and Kay must never tell anyone. You'll never forget it, but you'll learn to live with it.\" Within a week, Martyn says, Camelot had carried out checks on ticket sales, confirming the couple's story that they bought 10 tickets in blocks every five weeks at Londis in St Albans - one ticket for each bi-weekly draw. \"They said they were 101% certain,\" Martyn says. But for a second week, nothing happened. Paranoia set in. The purchasing manager in Martyn took over and he started to treat the jackpot like an unpaid invoice, logging in detail his every fruitless call to Camelot. He borrowed telephone recording equipment from a friend under the guise of needing evidence for a mail-order dispute. \"I was thinking, 'Hang on - what proof have I got that any of this even took place? If this is just Camelot versus a disgruntled punter who says they lost their ticket, what chance have we got?'\" Then, finally, Challis called with a new request. Camelot needed proof that the couple were who they said they were: pay slips, utility bills, mortgage details, bank statements, wedding and birth certificates. \"I thought, well, this is intimidating - but why do all this if it wasn't pretty much sorted out? I thought Camelot had just told him, 'Go back and just be certain they're not fraudsters.'\" They were thrilled, convinced they were on the verge of winning. That weekend, they broke their self-imposed rules and allowed themselves to fantasise. In a dreamlike, near-hysterical state, they started to plan what to do with their millions. Of course, there would be lump sums for the family, and treatment for Martyn's father's arthritis, but there would also be luxuries. \"We're not the sort of people that would get a mansion and a Ferrari,\" Martyn says, \"but something with four or five bedrooms in a nice area, your average \u00a330,000 car, one of those new Audi TT Quatros?\" Giggling, they drove around Theydon Bois - \"where Rod Stewart lives\" - fantasising about houses costing \u00a3500,000. But then, agonisingly, nothing did happen: Camelot fell effectively silent for four weeks. Kay couldn't sleep; Martyn drank more than he usually did - nothing calamitous, just the indistinct chaos of a life on hold. They started to argue. \"We were starting to fray a bit,\" says Martyn. \"We were bickering all the time. One person would ask the other what they thought was going to happen next, but of course neither of us could answer that.\" Their parents, still in the dark, began to worry. \"They thought there was something wrong with out marriage, there was this atmosphere between us. It was all we could talk about between ourselves but we were desperate to tell someone.\" In the end they told their parents, swearing them to secrecy on Camelot's instructions. They kept on showing up at work as if nothing was out of the ordinary, and waited. It was a call from Challis, two Thursdays ago, that ended the waiting. Kay had a towel around her head, preparing to go out; Martyn was running a bath. But Challis was calling them from his car outside their house and wanted to come in, so Martyn set up his recording equipment in the kitchen in a hurry. \"He said he had bad news: rules is rules, and no exception can be made in this case,\" says Martyn. Camelot, Challis explained, had spent the last weeks \"legally testing\" the 30-day rule in consultation with the creators of the rules, the national lottery commission, and had concluded that their hands were tied. \"We were just stunned. We just sat there. Were they testing the rules, or testing our resilience not to crack up? Weaker people would have split up or, I don't want to say it, but someone could have done themselves in over this.\" Kay's anger returned quicker than Martyn's. \"Challis had a woman with him like a social worker, and all she kept saying was 'I understand, I understand.' This woman who I'd never seen before in my life was saying 'I understand' - I was just boiling up, I felt sick. I was shaking. I just told Martyn, 'Get them out of my house.'\" Martyn did not remain stunned for long. By the Monday morning, he was in Max Clifford's office in London. To the Totts, their experiences with Camelot and their subsequent public statements amount to nothing less than a fight for justice against the lottery's Kafkaesque bureaucracy. They reserve their strongest words for Challis, and for the \"30-day rule\" on lost tickets, which was not widely publicised when it was introduced in December 1997 to replace a rather more straightforward \"no ticket, no prize\" policy. \"We wanted the truth to get out, to say this is how Camelot behaved to us, and this is how they could behave to you,\" says Martyn. \"We want justice to be done.\" If it is difficult to take such grand claims at face value, it is equally hard not to feel sympathy. The Totts have been caught in the contradiction that makes the lottery function - the insistence that it's all just a bit of fun, a moment's relief from the daily grind, overlain with the unspoken riposte: yes, but it could change everything forever. It was the former thought that explained why they didn't check their ticket that week in September - \"after seven years, you just think well, I buy a ticket, but I'm never going to win a blooming thing\" - but it was the latter that got them hoping. \"It's not only about the money,\" says Kay. \"We were happy before, and we'll be happy again. But if they'd have told us that first night there'd be no money because we had no ticket, we'd have been gutted, but at least we could have got on with our lives.\"",

I'm also giving out peaceful protest leaflets and T-shirts in the hope that we can raise awareness but keep the day as trouble-free as possible. Of course there are factions that want violence, but I've been very distressed to see the way that the police and the media have concentrated on that. Every time there's violence, that just clouds things. </p> <p><b> Niki Adams, 37, from London, campaigner for Wages for Housework</b> </p> <p>We want payment for all the caring work that women and children do across the globe, as well as equality of pay for all. We need to transfer the millions currently allotted to defence into the essentials of life: decent pay, paid maternity leave, and the abolition of third world debt. Women pay the highest price for globalisation and third world poverty. They do two-thirds of the world's work, much of which is low-waged or unpaid. Multinational companies need to reform their pay structures. Why is a sweatshop worker in India not given the same rate of pay as a worker doing a similar job in the west? </p> <p><b> Ronny, 27, from London, caterer</b> </p> <p>I've made veggie burgers to hand out to the Critical Mass cyclists after they've finished their action. I'm involved in campaigning on animal rights, and I've set up outside McDonald's because that company represents, for me, the very worst side of global capitalism. Think of the number of people who are touched by a big corporation like this, from the parents who have to fork out for their kids to eat there, because of their targeted advertising towards children. All for food that doesn't fill people up and is bad for them. </p> <p><b> June Williams, 50s, from London, retired</b> </p> <p>I came here to show solidarity, and in defiance of the mayor of London, who wants us to stop feeding the pigeons in Trafalgar Square. I suspect that Westminster city council is desperate to get rid of this square, get rid of the pigeons and replace it with something altogether more corporate. It's a free space for poor families to come to, and there aren't many other areas like that in London. It's not enough to stay at home and grumble. You realise that that's not going to change anything. </p> <p><b> Tym Ellis, 21, from Twickenham, south-west London, works in a toy shop</b> </p> <p>I came to the May Day action last year, and I really liked the atmosphere. Everyone was relaxed and it was really chilled out. Similarly, I've really enjoyed this morning. I'm here to make my voice heard about globalisation - all the cliches I suppose - third world debt, anti-capitalism, the environment - but it's important for me to be here. It's good to feel part of something, part of protests and concerns that are happening all over the world. </p> <p><b> Joel Hirsch, 52, post office worker from London</b> </p> <p>I've just popped out from work in my lunch break. The politicians are all the same, turning a blind eye to the multinationals and what they're doing to the world. But people are beginning to realise how those companies are having an impact on their lives. I thought that I'd have a lot of arguments with people at the office when I told them that I was coming here, but actually most of them thought it was worthwhile. </p> <p><b> Siobhain O'Conner, 18, A-level student from Tooting, south London</b> </p> <p>I came here to be educated. I don't know much about politics yet, but it seems to me it's all about freedom and choice. I've just been to a demonstration about student debt, demanding grants not fees. Too many people I know are saying they won't go to university because they don't want to get into debt.There are lots of ordinary people here - it's not all hippies and anarchists. It's really important for people to assert themselves. </p> <p><b> Leah Barnett, 30s, from London, solicitor</b> </p> <p>I'm not a member of any particular party or group, and I'm not here for any particular event. I suppose I'm against the whole corporatisation of the world. Look at the shops around here: pretty much every one of them is charging too much, using sweatshops and exploiting its workers. It's actually great to see them boarded up today. The threat of rubber bullets did put me off. But it's more important as a citizen of this country to stand up for people's rights. </p> <p><b> Nessa Heroabadi, 20, student from Middlesex</b> </p> <p>Everyone turns a blind eye to what's going on in the world, yet when people get together to protest about it they all make a big deal about the possibility of violence. There are 800m people starving in the world, but we spend millions on defence and wars. It doesn't make sense. What's most upsetting is feeling like nothing's ever going to change. </p> <p><b> Katie Fiander, 16, schoolgirl from Middlesex</b> </p> <p>I don't want to be violent, but we all have the right to voice our opinion. It upsets me to see people getting violent. What's the point in smashing a window? It's not going to solve anything. The police aren't helping though. It all feels quite aggressive here. All the grown-ups and the police were telling us not to go, but I wanted to see what it was like. I wanted to meet interesting people, and find out what's really going on. It's my future. </p> <p><b> Helen Kelly, 35, playwright, from Birmingham</b> </p> <p>It's my first time at a demonstration of this size. I'm particularly concerned about pollution. I don't drive, and I used to cycle, but I don't any more because it's so dangerous with all the traffic. I also think that raising people's awareness of issues like sweatshops and child labour is important. Something like this focuses these questions in people's minds. </p> <p> <b> Lola, 24, singer, from London</b> </p> <p>People are unhappy, seeing what big business has done to the planet. And there's this weird sort of mental exhaustion, as people strive after this dream that they're fed by big business: buy this, buy that.

The vice-president, Dick Cheney, who heads a taskforce set up by President George Bush to look into the US energy crisis, dismissed on Monday night the idea of \"conserving or rationing\" as 1970s-era solutions to the US's energy shortages. In a speech in Toronto, Mr Cheney said that \"conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound, comprehensive energy policy\". His taskforce's report, asked to find solutions to the energy crisis which has caused power blackouts in California and a rise in petrol prices across America, is expected to be published later this month. Ignoring international outrage at Washington's decision to pull out of the Kyoto protocol on climate change, Mr Cheney said he would call for oil and natural gas drilling in protected areas in Alaska and the Rocky Mountains, the revival of the US coal industry and the first nuclear power plant-building programme in North America since the Three Mile Island reactor disaster in 1979. He rejected energy conservation and renewable energy sources as major alternatives, promoting nuclear power as good for the environment since it emitted few greenhouse gases, ignoring the problems of nuclear waste disposal. This new tact will be greeted with delight by British Nuclear Fuels, the largest designer of nuclear stations in the world. \"America's reliance on energy, and fossil fuels in particular, has lately taken on an urgency not felt since the late 1970s,\" Mr Cheney said. \"Without a clear, coherent energy strategy, all Americans could one day go through what Californians are experiencing now, or worse.\" Oil, coal and natural gas would remain the US's primary energy resources for \"years down the road\", he said.

The pledge of an underlying profit, built on the back of rising revenues, lower capital spending and greater efficiency, saw the shares climb 10% higher as investors took the view the worst could be over. Bill Allan, the chief executive, said: \"All the numbers are going in the right direction. If we keep on going the right way we have nothing to fear.\" Thus spent heavily on building a national network, sought to focus on the business market and now believes it is seeing the benefits of this strategy. It has picked up clients including BSkyB, GE Capital, Scottish Provident, Intelligent Finance, Royal Bank of Scotland and London Electricity, many in its fast growing data and telecoms sector. Revenues for the year to the end of March rose by 8% to \u00a3233.8m with the second half showing a much faster rate of growth - up 25% to \u00a3129.9m. The focus on the corporate and small- and medium-sized enterprise market meant a switch in sales of the internet business from traditional dial-up services to more business orientated services such as access, commercial web hosting, e-commerce and streaming media. However the continued cost of spending on building up the network - \u00a3158.9m - meant the company was left with a loss before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of \u00a321.4m - though all but \u00a34.1m of that total was clocked up in the first half. This year Thus is expecting revenues to continue growing strongly - by more than 20%, excluding the interactive services division which is up for sale - while capital spending is expected to fall to around \u00a3110m and in the long term should settle down at between 10% to 15% of revenues. As a result - and provided the economy is not suddenly blown off course - the group is expecting that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation is expected to be \"positive over the year as a whole.\" Nigel Hawkins, telecoms analyst at Williams de Broe, said: \"Revenues are on target and I think the market thinks the worst really is over now.

In one case the successful bidder had to buy capacity from Thus and \"we did not give it away for nothing\". The completion of the network building programme will not mean heavy job losses as Thus contracted out much of the work. \"You won't see much change (in employment numbers) this year, either up or down,\" Mr Allan said. He said that the group had received a number of approaches for the interactive services business and hoped to complete a sale by the end of June.

The rally, organised by the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, began with union leaders criticising the Mugabe regime and receiving enthusiastic cheers from more than 6,000 workers. Then a few hundred veterans took over the stage and vowed to renew their attacks on scores of leading businesses. Several hundred more joined the trade unionists in the stands at the Harare football stadium. The two groups were kept apart by the police. The leader of the factory invasions, Joseph Chinotimba, arrived in a government vehicle driven by a police officer and was protected from the crowd by riot police. He told the rally: \"The ZCTU is a political party and has failed to represent you.

Police say many of the women had their hands tied, were naked and appeared to have been sexually assaulted. About half of the women had been decapitated.

A week later, the police uncovered another grave nearby.</p> <p>A Royal Swazi Police inspector, Ross Maseko, said he believed Mr Simelane was working alone. \"We cannot say that the man confessed to the killing, but he is being very cooperative with the police in their investigations. From the responses, we are positive that he is responsible for the killings,\" he said.</p> <p>The interlude between the announcement that a serial killer was on the loose and the capture of the alleged murderer led to fevered speculation as to what motivated the crimes.</p> <p>King Mswati III's mother, who rules alongside her son, suspected demonic activity and urged her subjects to pray for salvation. \"The demons have spread everywhere and they can only be subdued by prayer,\" she said.</p> <p>The League of Churches blamed a religious cult similar to one involved in the death of 700 worshippers in Uganda last year. Women's groups blamed a hidebound traditional and sexist culture.</p> <p>Relatives of missing women flocked to the area to see if their loved ones were among the victims. Other women reported being kidnapped and escaping.</p> <p>The discovery of the mass graves came just days after the police shot dead another suspected serial killer linked to six people whose bodies were unearthed in another part of Swaziland. At first the police believed the two cases may be linked but they changed their minds after they detained Mr Simelane on a road near where the killings he is alleged to have committed took place.</p>",

About half of the women had been decapitated. Only two of the bodies have been identified. The Swazi authorities called in six South African police forensic experts after a herd boy looking for a lost cow discovered the first bodies in the Usuthu Pulp Forest, a popular spot for lovers, in the central Malkerns area. A week later, the police uncovered another grave nearby. A Royal Swazi Police inspector, Ross Maseko, said he believed Mr Simelane was working alone. \"We cannot say that the man confessed to the killing, but he is being very cooperative with the police in their investigations. From the responses, we are positive that he is responsible for the killings,\" he said. The interlude between the announcement that a serial killer was on the loose and the capture of the alleged murderer led to fevered speculation as to what motivated the crimes. King Mswati III's mother, who rules alongside her son, suspected demonic activity and urged her subjects to pray for salvation. \"The demons have spread everywhere and they can only be subdued by prayer,\" she said. The League of Churches blamed a religious cult similar to one involved in the death of 700 worshippers in Uganda last year. Women's groups blamed a hidebound traditional and sexist culture. Relatives of missing women flocked to the area to see if their loved ones were among the victims. Other women reported being kidnapped and escaping. The discovery of the mass graves came just days after the police shot dead another suspected serial killer linked to six people whose bodies were unearthed in another part of Swaziland. At first the police believed the two cases may be linked but they changed their minds after they detained Mr Simelane on a road near where the killings he is alleged to have committed took place.",

The demonstrations, involving at their peak up to 40,000 protesters, \"were funded by people with a political agenda,\" Gloria Arroyo said on television after sending troops and riot police on to the streets of Manila and declaring a state of rebellion. The protesters' goal was \"to bring down the legitimate government\", said the president, looking haggard as she spoke on television after two nights without sleep. Anyone plotting to overthrow the government, she added, would be \"beaten to a pulp\". When a state of rebellion is decreed suspects can be arrested without a warrant. Eleven opposition figures are reported to be on President Arroyo's list as suspected organisers of the protests. At least two policemen and two rioters were killed, more than 140 people were injured, and 100 protesters were in detention as the worst violence in the city for 15 years continued into yesterday morning after erupting late on Monday. After failing to force their way into the palace on Monday, the mob of Estrada supporters - mostly young men armed with a motley assortment of weapons - started attacking shops, vehicles and construction equipment. Calm eventually returned last night. There is no word on how long the state of rebellion will last. The first opposition leader detained was Senator Ponce Enrile, the former defence secretary. Several other senators were on the list, along with Panfilo Lacson, the police chief under the disgraced former president, Joseph Estrada. Mr Lacson is running for the senate in elections due on May 14. The rioting broke out just days after Mr Estrada was put in detention charged with plundering the economy. As the disturbances spread, the one-time hero of the poor was taken from a military hospital where he was having tests to a top-security centre 30 miles from Manila. From there he issued a statement urging calm and criticising Ms Arroyo. \"Exercise restraint in the face of the grave crisis facing our nation today,\" he said. \"We must not give this regime any reason to further trample on our rights of assembly by using excessive force. We must not also give this regime an excuse to declare martial law to ensure its continued stay in power and to further inflict harm on its own people.\" He reiterated his long-trumpeted view that he did not resign when he surrendered the presidency in January to Ms Arroyo after massive street protests and the defection of the security forces and much of his cabinet. Analysts expect Ms Arroyo to survive this first major threat to her fledgling administration, even if the violence continues, because the security forces and most of the legislature are fully behind her. Referring to Mr Estrada, the head of the Roman Catholic church in the Philippines, Cardinal Jaime Sin, said at a mass yesterday: \"Those who abused and manipulated the poor will be accountable to God.\"",

It has not built a single new nuclear plant since then, although the industry still produces a fifth of its electricity. Apart from the fear of an accident, reinforced by Chernobyl in 1986, the industry has been dogged by the problem of dealing with spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste. Attempts to create a long-term depository for thousands of spent fuel rods and the accumulated waste of 50 years have failed, in both the US and Britain. In Russian and Ukraine, which have toyed with the idea of taking the west's nuclear rubbish, the problem is even more acute, and there are doubts about the safety of their reactors and storage sites.

      "bodyText": "A senior British army officer has called on the international community to bring Croat war criminals to justice in Bosnia. Lieutenant-Colonel Hector Gullan of the Parachute Regiment and the SAS led an undercover investigation into the violent intimidation of refugees trying to return to Stolac, in south-eastern Bosnia, in 1998 and 1999. His report, delivered to the international authorities in Bosnia, called for the immediate arrest of 22 people suspected of violence, extortion and intimidation since the war, and for crimes against humanity during the expulsion of Bosnian Muslims from the area during the war in the republic in 1993. But the men his report accused are still free, and in many cases, still hold power. He made his statement yesterday, after receiving an OBE from the Queen for his services in Bosnia. \"Until those that perpetrated these appalling crimes, and who continue to rule the Stolac municipality by fear, are brought to account in the courts - either in Sarajevo or at the Hague [war crimes tribunal] - and made to stand responsible for what they did, this medal will never shine as it should,\" he said. Before the war Stolac was a town of 8,000 Muslims, 6,000 Croats, and 4,000 Serbs. Dark red poppies stand out against the bare mountainsides and the scrub vegetation growing in valleys where the stones seem to outnumber patches of soil. The town itself, 40 minutes' drive south of Mostar, was a jewel in this wilderness - proposed for inclusion in Unesco's list of world heritage sites. Mosques, Catholic and Orthodox churches stood close by. But during the war, and even afterwards, every sacred and secular building belonging to Muslims was blown up, including three medieval mosques and 2,000 homes. The aim was to prevent non-Croats ever returning. The town is still in ruins, and the ostensible nationalism has become a cover for hanging on to what was looted in the war, and present-day earnings from running guns to Kosovo, cigarettes to Italy, and stolen cars through the Balkans. Non-stolen goods can also be profitable. As no one dares to come from the capital here to collect taxes, even the sale of everyday consumer goods can line the pocket. Stark concrete crosses dot the valleys - with little pretence to religious significance. They are intended to mark territory, and keep out Muslims. Men with dark glasses watch for intruders outside bars and petrol stations. Within minutes, the whole network of war criminals and their protectors can be tipped off. Beside the road are stocks of building material in strategic places. If Bosnian police make another attempt to seize local criminals - they have failed twice so far - roads can be blocked in moments, and the police ambushed. While a few war-crimes suspects are in hiding, many of those accused of being torturers at the Dretelj, Heliodrome and Gabela concentration camps are still at large. Returnees - 2,000 Muslims and several hundred Serbs so far - sometimes see in the street those who abused and expelled them, and now treat them as second-class citizens. Farida (not her real name) will return soon from Mostar, despite her fear of doing so. She and her family were among those driven out in 1993. She carried her mother on her back for several miles in the terrible heat of July, with Croat snipers shooting over the heads of those fleeing, to spur them on. On this death march from Buna to Blagaj, Farida had to choose between saving her mother, or her two young children. To her torment, she abandoned her invalid mother to die in no-man's land. Fuad (his name has also been changed) describes Dretelj concentration camp that same month. Crammed into a metal-roofed hangar in one of the hottest areas of Europe, some prisoners died in the oven, others went mad. The guards sprayed bullets through the door, for fun. \"The victims are exaggerating,\" says the current mayor of Stolac, Zdravko Guzman. \"It's time to forget about the past, and turn instead to the future.' A member of the nationalist Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) which wants to break from Bosnia, he laughs when I ask if it would help reconciliation if Croats apologised for destroying the Muslims' homes and mosques: \"Why should we apologise?

Pictures on German television showed 10 burned-out carriages at the top of the track. \"We just barely avoided a catastrophe,\" Mr Granitzka said. The authorities excluded arson, saying the fire was caused by a technical fault, probably a short circuit. The park's founder, Gottlieb Loeffelhardt, said he thought it likely that a cable fire in one of the cars activated the emergency brakes, causing sparks. NTV television showed the singer Michael Jackson visiting Phantasialand in 1996, saying he owned a carousel there. The site has been closed until further notice.",

The house with the world's narrowest front went on the market yesterday with barely enough space to hang the estate agent's sign. The property on the island of Great Cumbrae off the Ayrshire coast measures just 3ft 11in at its narrowest point. Downstairs there is just enough room for the front door and upstairs there is a single window. The house, shaped like a slice of cheese, is known locally as The Wedge. The owners, George and June Allison, bought it almost 20 years ago before its record-holding potential was realised. Mrs Allison, 57, said they were selling because her husband George, 65, was retiring and they wanted to enjoy more leisure without having to look after the house, which they have been renting out. \"It goes from the smallest point and opens out,\" she said. \"Downstairs there is a small porch and you walk through into a kind of studio-lounge-cum-kitchen.

The issue came to light when a story appeared in the Glasgow Herald on the narrowest house, which was supposedly in the south of England. An architect friend suggested they should measure The Wedge as he thought it might be narrower. The front of the house proved to be only 47ins - narrower than the house mentioned in the article - so Mrs Allison said they contacted the newspaper and soon had a listing in the Guinness Book of Records. A spokeswoman for the Guinness Book of Records confirmed The Wedge was listed as having the narrowest house frontage in the world.",

The audience is spellbound, recalling the moment when the young heiress, who had been kidnapped by an urban guerrilla group calling itself the Symbionese Liberation Army, was captured on film taking part in a daylight robbery that sent shock waves across the US.</p> <p>This is not the real Patricia Hearst, however, but one of Los Angeles's brightest young comedians and actors, Mona Mansour, starring in her one-woman show, Me and the SLA. It is a tour de force in which Mansour takes on the persona of herself as a seven-year-old girl who witnesses the Hibernia robbery, then runs off and joins the SLA, sharing a closet with Patty Hearst and living on the run. During the performance, Mansour reads out a letter from the Hearst family lawyers, warning her not to stage the show or to face a lawsuit. It transpires that she has been fascinated by the case ever since it happened and she was a seven-year-old who fantasised about helping poor Patty and having her as a friend.</p> <p>The real Patricia Hearst will shortly be performing in LA, not on stage but as prosecution witness in the trial of Sarah Jane Olson. A former associate of the SLA, she was arrested in 1999 in St Paul, Minnesota, after more than two decades of living on the run as a respectable doctor's wife and - as the press likes to portray her - a \"soccer mom\".</p> <p>The real Hearst will certainly be asked in detail about that strange period in her life so carefully conjured up on stage in Me and the SLA. After the show, Mansour says that she had contacted the Hearst family lawyers to let them know she was planning to do the show and they had been very relaxed about it. Perhaps, after more than a quarter of a century, Patricia Hearst has reconciled herself to people's fantasies about her.</p> <p>There will be fewer laughs when the case of Olson, who changed her name from Kathleen Soliah, finally gets under way after many delays. Olson had managed to disappear into quiet suburban anonymity, bringing up her three daughters with her wealthy surgeon husband, acting in the local dramatic society and doing good works through her local church. Had the FBI not supplied her photograph for a special edition of the television programme America's Most Wanted, to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Hearst kidnapping, she would still be going quietly about her life. She is out on $1m bail now, has written a cookbook to raise funds for her defence and has had to tell her daughters about her outlaw past. A student radical, she had joined the SLA after her friend, Angela Atwood, had been one of the six SLA members who died in a blazing house following a gunfight with the LA police.</p> <p>In her court appearances so far, Olson has come across as a thoughtful, intelligent woman, far removed from the craziness that was the SLA. Her lawyers are clearly counting on this to win over the jury in what promises to be a long trial; the initial legal arguments, even before a jury can be sworn in, are estimated to last at least three weeks.</p> <p>The expected highlight of the case, however, will undoubtedly be the evidence of Hearst, forced by subpoena to relive that time of her life when she was taken at gunpoint from her home in Berkeley in 1974 and forced to join up with a group that lived out mad fantasies of revolution. She was held in a closet for more than 50 days, given gun training and the \"revolutionary\" name Tania, and learned the SLA's memorable slogan: \"Death to the fascist insect that preys upon the life of the people.\"</p> <p>Hearst was present for the Hibernia robbery, carried out to garner funds and publicity for the SLA, but was not with the core of the group when they died in the LA blaze. She was arrested in San Francisco in 1975, jailed for seven years and freed 23 months later, after Jimmy Carter, then US president, commuted her sentence on the grounds that she had been forced into the SLA. President Clinton finally pardoned her on his final day in office, an act that passed almost unnoticed amid the fuss generated by his other acts of clemency.</p> <p>What has happened to Hearst in the time between being hoisted off campus as a privileged young student to her status now as an independent movie diva and gay icon is, in its way, every bit as revolutionary as what the SLA was preaching. The Patricia Hearst who is now familiar to fans of the radical film-maker John Waters is very different from the Patty Hearst who so terrified the parents of America in 1974. The new one is blonde and smiling, the latter was dark-haired, beret-wearing and, understandably, grim-faced.</p> <p>Hearst appears in Waters's film Cecil B Demented, just released on video, playing a role that must be as close to postmodern edge as you can get without falling over the other side. The story is of the kidnap of pampered actress Holly Whitlock (played by Melanie Griffith) by a group of independent guerrilla film-makers whose slogan is \"bad movies must be avenged\". Holly resists the kidnappers at first but then becomes part of the gang, shooting it out with the best of them. Hearst plays the tearful mother of one of the kidnappers, the mild-mannered young Fidget, and appears on television with her very straight husband, trying to talk reason to her wayward boy. In the course of all the mayhem, a policeman is shot. Hearst's part mirrors that played by her own mother, who also made tearful appearances on television during her daughter's time with the SLA.</p> <p>Hearst met Waters at the Cannes film festival, which she attended for the screening of Paul Schrader's 1988 film Patty Hearst, with Natasha Richardson as Hearst. She enjoys her new career, though she has said there are easier ways to get into films than being kidnapped - waiting tables, for instance. She has appeared in Cry-Baby, Serial Mom and Pecker, and in sitcoms such as Boston Common; her next project is a film about sex addicts, set in Baltimore, and her reappearance on the criminal justice scene coincides with her debut as a television presenter.</p> <p>Her first project, screened on the Travel Channel in March and entitled The Secrets of San Simeon, was a guide to her family's stately home, Hearst Castle on the California coast. Secrecy seems to be a theme of her work. Her autobiography, Every Secret Thing, published after her release in 1982, took its title from Ecclesiastes 12:14: \"For God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil.\"</p> <p>Olson, now 54, is charged with conspiring to murder, in connection with a plot to plant nailbombs under police cars in LA. No one died in that attempt but a woman was murdered during a bank robbery in Sacramento in which Olson is alleged to have taken part. In Every Secret Thing, Hearst puts Olson at the scene, but does not make her responsible for the shooting of Myrna Lee Opshal, the woman who died.</p> <p>Olson has not been charged with that murder, though the son of the dead woman, Jon Opshal, has urged that she should be prosecuted and the new Los Angeles district attorney wants to see the case re-examined. Olson contests the Hearst version. She told a gathering to raise funds for her defence in San Francisco: \"Her version has been enshrined as the undisputed truth - until my trial.\"</p> <p>Hearst, meanwhile, does not see it as Olson's trial. In her only interview about the case, last year with Talk, which is part-owned by the Hearst family, she said: \"It has turned into my trial. And I am not going to play dead any more. I keep trying to forget these people and they keep dragging me back into it.\"</p> <p>Of Olson, she said: \"She had been leading such a quiet life. I heard about her reading to the blind and all. I thought, well, she's probably a lot nicer than I am. Who knows? But I have had to live my entire life in the public eye because of her actions and ... the rest of the SLA. And I just didn't feel sorry for her. She was just getting a good dollop of it. It's no fun, is it? But now I wish they'd never found her.\"</p> <p>When she appeared in Pasadena to promote her family history documentary last month, she told the press she was more than happy in her new role: \"It would be shocking if I weren't happy. And even if I weren't, who could possibly sympathise? I have a nice husband, two great kids and a nice house. I can't imagine who I'd complain to.\" She married her bodyguard, Bernard Shaw; they live in Fairfield County, Connecticut. Shaw is security director of the Hearst Corporation.</p> <p>Of the Schrader version of her life, Hearst said: \"It was well done, well acted, it pretty much stuck to the book and absolutely no one saw it. I was kind of glad it didn't do well. It meant no one else was tempted to do their version because who needs it?\"</p> <p>The trial will also be a strange time for the other surviving former members of the SLA. They, too, have gone in different directions since 1974. Bill Harris was jailed for eight years for SLA-related crimes and is now a legal investigator in San Francisco. Emily Harris was also jailed for eight years and now works in the computer business in LA. Jack Scott, the sports journalist who helped the surviving members of the SLA when they were on the run, died last year. James Kilgore is still on the run.</p> <p>The trial will be recorded by Court TV on three video cameras. The cameras will show Sarah Jane Olson - a woman who graduated in theatre arts at the University of California, starred as Hedda Gabler in a campus production in Berkeley and went on to act in St Paul - giving evidence to save herself from a life sentence. They will also show a woman who is now best known as a comedy actress.</p> <p>But whatever the two women say in their stage and film roles, none of it will quite match the effect Hearst had with the famous tape she made at the behest of the SLA which was then released to the media and which Mansour has re-enacted in her show: \"For those people who still believe I am brainwashed or dead, I see no further reason to defend my position. I'm not dead. I'm a soldier in the People's Army.\"</p> <p>Doubtless the jury in the trial that started this week will hear the words and will want to know every secret thing, whether it be good or whether it be evil.</p>",

Hearsay evidence is acceptable, as it is so difficult to persuade witnesses to appear. Yet a breach of an order is a criminal offence, the penalty for which may be anything up to a five-year jail sentence. </p> <p>Gillian Crossley, the McCanns' solicitor, argues that Asbos should have been set wholly within the criminal justice context. Indeed, she is taking the case to appeal on this point. \"I do not think it was a very well thought through piece of legislation,\" she says. \"It is silent on standards of proof and I think it was naive to consider that these orders would be dealt with by duty solicitors in a five-minute hearing.\" </p> <p>\"By their very nature, they are not dealing with nice, compliant and friendly people with respect for authority.

Forced to move away, the boys have been unable to maintain links with relatives who still live in Beswick. </p> <p>Debate over the rights and wrongs of Asbos has been inflamed by an allegation by Straw that solicitors who challenge the orders are out to make money. He told a conference: \"Very aggressive defence lawyers sometimes forget about their wider social responsibilities and their responsibilities to the court, and, in trying to protect their niche markets with the local criminal fraternity, act in a way which would have been unacceptable when I was practising [as a barrister] 25 years ago.\" </p> <p>Crossley says she does not understand the basis for the minister's outburst. More important, she contends, is that Asbos have made no difference to the crime rate in Beswick. Superintendent Dave Thompson, of Grey Mare Lane police station in the heart of the estate, disagrees profoundly. He says that since the orders were introduced, crime has fallen by a third and burglaries by half. </p> <p>Takings at the local supermarket increased \u00a314,000 a week when the boys were banned, says Thompson. \"At the time when we obtained the order, there was a feeling that anything went round here,\" he says. \"A lot of people had lost confidence in the police and there was a perception that they [the McCanns] were untouchable. The three boys caused an enormous amount of problems for local people and committed a range of anti-social behaviour. And because residents were so scared of them, they were not willing to go to court.\" </p> <p> In the McCanns' case, there was no mediation and no attempt to sort out their problems prior to use of the Asbo. Since then, however, there has been a subtle change and orders are now regarded locally as a last resort for dealing with similar cases. Thompson says: \"We don't just want to beat them over the head with the orders; we're trying to explore the support systems that can be kicked in.\" </p> <p>Frank Whiteley, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, reckons Asbos have been relatively successful, but concedes that there have been teething troubles.

Children should have two legal parents when adopted by people in long-term relationships, said the British Agencies for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF) yesterday in evidence to the select committee on the adoption and children bill. As it stands, the bill will not change the current law, which only permits both partners to adopt if they are married. Politicians are likely to be wary about the move because of fears of a moralistic \"family values\" backlash and headlines about gay adoptions. \"We believe it is inappropriate to use adoption as a means of promoting the importance of marriage, if this has the effect of denying children, who are already disadvantaged, the opportunity of the joint legal and lifetime commitment of two parents,\" said BAAF chief executive Felicity Collier. \"It is estimated that 40% of children are born outside of marriage and that a similar proportion of adults live in committed relationships. If we restrict joint adoption to married couples, we can only reduce the opportunity for children to find adoptive parents.\" She said that social workers would take into account the stability and longevity of any relationship when assessing prospective adopters. But Conservative select committee member Caroline Spelman said married couples were more likely to offer a permanent two-parent home: \"The evidence shows that, if we are worried about permanency, married couples tend to stay together longer.\" Mrs Spelman said there was a contradiction between putting the welfare of the child first and allowing unmarried couples to become joint legal parents. The bill brings adoption law into line with the Children Act 1989 by making the welfare of the child paramount. Labour MP David Hinchcliffe, committee chairman, told SocietyGuardian.co.uk that: \"From a personal point of view, I can see the concern over where you have a child placed with unmarried foster carers and it may be deemed in their best interests to be adopted by both.\" But he added: \"I am not advocating lesbian and gay adoption - nor unmarried adoption, for that matter.\" BAAF also called for amendments to introduce a national system of financial support for adoptive parents and a register of private, informal fostering by friends and relatives. The government has promised that all adoptive parents will have a right to be assessed for post-adoption services from local authorities.
