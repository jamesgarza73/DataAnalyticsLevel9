Alex Ferguson has decided to break in some of the club's young bloods and and rest some of the more familiar faces ready for a renewed assault on the Premiership. Jonathan Greening, Danny Higginbotham, Mark Wilson, Quinton Fortune and Ronnie Wallwork all start while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer partners Andy Cole up front. David Beckham starts on the bench. Wallwork in particular will be keen to make a good impression and put to rest memories of the life ban he incurred in Belgium last year for assaulting a referee (later reduced to 12 months and applicable only in Belgium).

If United make it to the third-place play-off, also on Friday, it will be screened live on BBC1, but if they fail then the match will be shown live on BBC2. United's unsuccessful Brazilian expedition has at least proved good news for the BBC, which reported impressive viewing figures for the team's two live games so far. Saturday night's match with Vasco da Gama was watched by 9.2m viewers, peaking at 9.7m, giving an audience share of 38%; the BBC usually loses out to ITV on Saturday nights but this time it scored more viewers than Blind Date and Family Fortunes. Last Thursday's match against Necaxa was watched by 11m. A BBC spokesman said: \"We have had two sets of strong figures out of this tournament that have seen off the main opposition. BBC Choice has also done very well; the figures have stood up very well.\"",

India were reduced to 77 for four before partially recovering to muster 195 when Saurav Ganguly (61) and Robin Singh (50) dug in. Pakistan were soon in trouble in their reply, however, collapsing to 71 for six before defiance from the man of the match Yousuf Youhana (63). Even so victory looked remote until the off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq (27 not out) and Waqar Younis (13 not out) - whose stand had also secured a 45-run victory over the hosts on Sunday, set up by Shoaib's three-wicket haul - guided Pakistan home with an unbroken 47-run partnership. \u0095 Shane Warne's side strain, which came when he tore a muscle below the left shoulder in the defeat by Pakistan, may put him out for up to four weeks. He will probably miss all of the tournament's pool stage, which ends on January 31. The Australian leg-spinner, set to play for Hampshire next summer, said: \"I won't rush back because there is a lot of cricket coming up. I've had injuries before and come back, so hopefully it will not be different this time.\"",

She did say she though she would be filming a movie outside the United States around the time Episode II will be shot. \"Then she said she would not be replacing Jodie Foster in Hannibal, as her X-Files contract currently states that she cannot play an FBI Agent in any other film as this would be in conflict of interest with her character on The X-Files.\" The Mouse still owns the house A host of Academy Award contenders turned out to be no match for Columbia's animated Stuart Little which held on to the top US box-office spot at the weekend with an estimated $11.5 million. The film, which has now grossed more than $95 million, is due to pass the $100 million mark this week. Entertainment analyst Art Rockwell observed that even Sony (Columbia's parent company) had been unprepared for the film's success. \"It was a project that Sony was never quite sure of,\" Rockwell said. \"They were unprepared for success ... as evidenced by the lack of merchandising exploitation.\" In brief Over on Dark Horizons you can check out what's rumoured to be an opening shot by shot sequence of Scream 3, which opens in the US on February 4. Johnny Rotten will be at this year's Sundance film festival for the premiere of the Sex Pistols documentary, The Filth and the Fury. We don't know whether he'll be playing or not. Casting couch Patrick Swayze and Natasha Richardson are in final negotiations to star alongside Billy Bob Thornton and Charlize Theron in Waking Up in Reno for director Jordan Brady. In addition, Swayze is also in final negotiations to take on a role in Tony and Timothy Bui's indie feature Puff the Magic Dragon. Jan De Bont, no stranger to disaster films, will direct and produce the ecological disaster project Dust. The film is based on a novel by author-scientist Charles Pellegrino, who created the dinosaur-cloning theory that inspired Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park book.",

Little by little the fantasy begins to take over, until it's more comfortable to live in the spacecraft of his imagination than in the real world. </p> <p>In fact, he is withdrawing in all kinds of ways. Misbehaviour on a school trip to the theatre, blown up out of all proportion by the headteacher, results in his suspension, and during his enforced time at home (like being on a long space voyage) he begins to act in ways that must look deeply disturbed to others. </p> <p>But because Lesley Howarth is firmly on Thomas's side, and locates the narrative solidly with him, we're never lost. The reader can always follow his reasons for sleeping in a sleeping bag hung on a hook in his wall, for example. The crisis is resolved with great storytelling tact and craft, and the happy ending grows naturally out of the way things have been since the start of the story. </p> <p>Howarth is superb at conveying the ordinariness of the odd, and the oddness of the ordinary. The deadpan humour and the offhand compassion make this, I think, her best book since the award-winning Maphead.</p>",

Perhaps the loss of Graham Kelly and Keith Wiseman has not been grievously felt, but their departure in a bid-related \"scandal\" was a sign of the disruptive power the campaign would have. This was equally obvious at an early stage in the blows dealt to England's international credibility by the FA's falling-out with Germany and their decision to back Sepp Blatter rather than Lennart Johansson as the successor to Jo\u00e3o Havelange as Fifa president.</p> <p>So far, so bad, but nothing that would cause too many ordinary fans to lose much sleep. Yet the impact of the 2006 bid on the rebuilding of Wembley stadium and on the FA Cup have been much more widely felt. If it had not been for the central significance of the bid, the debate over Wembley's potential uses might have taken place in a much less fevered atmosphere. The FA's desire to get their way over the exclusion of athletics from the stadium was a direct result of the need to have their showpiece World Cup reconstruction project under way before the decision is made this summer.</p> <p>The bid's impact on the FA Cup is all too obvious in Manchester United's ill-conceived jaunt to Brazil and the bitterness it has unleashed both among fans and in the press. The fact that United could not be bothered to defend the Cup was bad enough. But the wall-to-wall coverage of their trip to Rio has also helped divert attention from the games in the Cup itself, already forced into unpopular dates on the calendar by the need to accommodate the Champions League priorities of United and Chelsea. The crowds at Sheffield Wednesday, Everton and Aston Villa in the fourth round were surely evidence enough that tinkering with the format has disillusioned many fans (particularly those asked to stump up on top of their season ticket purchase).</p> <p>What part of domestic football will the World Cup bid wreck next? Well, Tony Banks's political career looks a good bet, but few will care too much about that. But if David Davies's reported keenness to stage next year's alleged \"World Club Championship\" in England is any guide, the nauseating crawling to Fifa at the expense of domestic football has a fair way to run yet.</p>",

Perhaps the loss of Graham Kelly and Keith Wiseman has not been grievously felt, but their departure in a bid-related \"scandal\" was a sign of the disruptive power the campaign would have. This was equally obvious at an early stage in the blows dealt to England's international credibility by the FA's falling-out with Germany and their decision to back Sepp Blatter rather than Lennart Johansson as the successor to Jo\u00e3o Havelange as Fifa president. So far, so bad, but nothing that would cause too many ordinary fans to lose much sleep. Yet the impact of the 2006 bid on the rebuilding of Wembley stadium and on the FA Cup have been much more widely felt. If it had not been for the central significance of the bid, the debate over Wembley's potential uses might have taken place in a much less fevered atmosphere. The FA's desire to get their way over the exclusion of athletics from the stadium was a direct result of the need to have their showpiece World Cup reconstruction project under way before the decision is made this summer. The bid's impact on the FA Cup is all too obvious in Manchester United's ill-conceived jaunt to Brazil and the bitterness it has unleashed both among fans and in the press. The fact that United could not be bothered to defend the Cup was bad enough. But the wall-to-wall coverage of their trip to Rio has also helped divert attention from the games in the Cup itself, already forced into unpopular dates on the calendar by the need to accommodate the Champions League priorities of United and Chelsea. The crowds at Sheffield Wednesday, Everton and Aston Villa in the fourth round were surely evidence enough that tinkering with the format has disillusioned many fans (particularly those asked to stump up on top of their season ticket purchase). What part of domestic football will the World Cup bid wreck next? Well, Tony Banks's political career looks a good bet, but few will care too much about that. But if David Davies's reported keenness to stage next year's alleged \"World Club Championship\" in England is any guide, the nauseating crawling to Fifa at the expense of domestic football has a fair way to run yet.",

Because higher aspirations generally bring better results. So in theory, the introduction of obligatory home-school agreements should be a step towards raising school standards.</p> <p>\"Parents will be better aware of the importance of helping their child at school,\" said education minister Jacqui Smith last year. \"In signing these agreements, parents will be acknowledging their partnership with the school to help educate their child.\" </p> <p>The practice, though, hasn't been so simple. Critics saw the initiative as more evidence of the government's managerialist approach, with neither parents nor teachers being trusted to raise and educate children without government direction and interference. </p> <p>David Gordon, chairman of the Campaign for State Education, described the initiative as \"patronising\". \"It is an insult to parents,\" he said, \"to suggest that they will only get their children to school on time... and help them with their homework if they sign an agreement.\" </p> <p>Margaret Morrisey at the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations described the new agreements as a \"non event\". Many schools had them already and in schools where there were problems between teachers and parents, she said, \"the situation isn't necessarily improved by the existence of a formal document\". </p> <p>Like many new Labour policies, home-school agreements are actually a Conservative idea, touted by the Major government as a \"contract\" between parents and schools that would allow parents to call teachers to account. The word contract was soon dropped, when doubters pointed out the potential difficulties involved in enforcing either side of the deal. </p> <p>But the principle neatly fitted new Labour's core philosophy. One of the key values outlined by Anthony Giddens in his book The Third Way was \"no rights without responsibilities\". And in 1998, David Blunkett, the education secretary, laid the blame for poor educational performance firmly at the door of parents. </p> <p>\"Where there is a problem,\" he said, \"It is all too often because parents claim not to have the time... So far from being a nanny state, we must become an enabling state, which ensures that parents and families have the backing when they need it.\" </p> <p>At Westwood High School in Staffordshire, which has had a home-school agreement for some years, headteacher George Wiskin argues that it's no bad thing to highlight the things the school believes are important. He believes that the process of setting up an agreement helped to focus on those values and led to an improvement in relationships, both inside and outside the school. But he also argues that it was \"foolish\" of the government to give the policy such a high profile last year and he's concerned that further development of the policy could lead to government-set benchmarks, consumer standards that schools would have to meet. </p> <p>The criticism that the agreements are one-sided, that schools are in effect only promising to deliver what parents would expect as a minimum, has been made by organisations such as the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations. And the idea of a more equal relationship is not unattractive to parents like Gillian Wheeldon, whose children attend Sunnyhill Junior School in London. </p> <p> Sunnyhill's agreement is based on the government model, which Wheeldon thinks \"was a bit bland\". She has no complaints about the school, where she is a governor, but she feels that parents might welcome an agreement with more teeth. \"Most parents would like termly parents' evenings,\" she said, \"but this is a dialogue which you would hope would evolve.\" </p> <p>This point is made forcefully in a research paper based on a three-year project that examined parents' relationships with secondary schools. Author Gill Crozier of Bath Spa University College concluded that schools \"have not been successful... in consulting with parents\". One father was quoted in the study complaining that when consultation did occur, it was more symbolic than real. </p> <p>\"They've got fixed ideas about what they're doing, and how they are going to do it,\" he said. \"I think they expect you to comply.\" </p> <p>Annie Clews, headteacher at Sunnyhill, took a more positive view. \"It's about opening up access,\" she said. The school's agreement (below) was drawn up by parent governors who spent the summer consulting with other parents, both formally and in playground conversation. Sunnyhill's pupils were involved and the rule about looking after one's own feet and hands came directly from them. Very few parents refused to sign the agreement; Clews is more concerned about the families who simply failed to return the form. </p> <p>\"These were precisely the families we'd like to see in school more often,\" she said. And that's the true weakness of the policy. It's naive to believe that a written document will effect changes that are deeply rooted in a family's economic and social conditions. \"One parent came in to complain,\" said Clews, \"because she was angry about having to fill in an extra form.\" </p> <p>Clews believes that the agreements may represent just another lever for the middle-class parent and she's concerned about the \"have not\" groups for whom the form is just another state-inspired irritant.

As all three banks began to step up their charm offensive to persuade major institutional investors to back them, Sir George Mathewson, chief executive of the Royal Bank, admitted there were some concerns that shareholders might be deluged with information in the run up to the St Valentine's day deadline. Senior banking sources are worried this might breed apathy among investors or, as investors begin to bite on certain arguments, split the vote between the three camps. Reflecting what was described by one banker as an increasing body of opinion in the City, one major shareholder in NatWest, said: \"There appears to be some concern in the market that there could be a situation where 35% [of shareholders] go for Royal Bank, 35% for Bank of Scotland, neither one succeeds and NatWest remains independent. Yet 70% will have opted for a takeover.\" NatWest's hopes of escaping the competing bids are said to have been improved since the appointment of Gordon Pell from Lloyds TSB to run its British banking operation, and whom Sir George said yesterday he might retain if his firm's bid is successful. Sir George yesterday accused NatWest of selective use of a report by consultancy firm Deloitte Research and produced a letter from the firm saying its research had been used out of context by NatWest to prove mergers did not work. His bank's shares have been bought by CGU, the insurance group, which spent \u00a350m as part of its support for the offer. NatWest, which retorted with new statistics about bank mergers, yesterday boosted its case for independence by announcing an alliance with Chase Merchant Services of the US to process credit card transactions, in which they are both market leaders. NatWest's fund management operation, Gartmore, also announced a strong improvement in its performance to 27% over the year, which might help to raise the price for NatWest which is selling it off as part of its defence.

      "body": "<p>\"I started crying when the best new teacher made her speech and I finished when the winner of the Lifetime Award was cheered by her class. I got through a whole box of tissues.\" </p> <p>That was how one viewer, not a teacher, reacted to the 1999 Teaching Awards ceremony shown on prime-time television in July. Sitting in the audience as one of the judges, I experienced that same wrung-out feeling alongside hundreds of other people. There was barely a dry hanky in the house. </p> <p>So why was it such an emotional occasion? After all, teaching has been a most vilified profession in recent years. Hardly a week goes by without some newspaper, politician or chief inspector pointing out yet more real or imagined failings in this battered group. You would have expected boos and hisses from the general public, not cheers and tears. </p> <p>The occasion may have been cathartic. We all resent teachers to some extent, as they are usually our first authority figure outside the family, a collage of Mr Plod, the person who chases you away when you try to scrump apples, and Torquemada. Parents may dislike them even more.

      "bodyText": "\"I started crying when the best new teacher made her speech and I finished when the winner of the Lifetime Award was cheered by her class. I got through a whole box of tissues.\" That was how one viewer, not a teacher, reacted to the 1999 Teaching Awards ceremony shown on prime-time television in July. Sitting in the audience as one of the judges, I experienced that same wrung-out feeling alongside hundreds of other people. There was barely a dry hanky in the house. So why was it such an emotional occasion? After all, teaching has been a most vilified profession in recent years. Hardly a week goes by without some newspaper, politician or chief inspector pointing out yet more real or imagined failings in this battered group. You would have expected boos and hisses from the general public, not cheers and tears. The occasion may have been cathartic. We all resent teachers to some extent, as they are usually our first authority figure outside the family, a collage of Mr Plod, the person who chases you away when you try to scrump apples, and Torquemada. Parents may dislike them even more.

I am confident that when these are revisited in 12 months time considerable improvements will have been made.\" Beverley Thompson, the director of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, added: \"In the past and still today, the experience of many black and ethnic minority people is that the police are more interested in treating them as suspects than as possible victims or witnesses.\"",

He said the force needed to concentrate on retaining staff.</p> <p>The inspectors praised the \"energy, leadership and commitment\" of senior officers to improving the service to ethnic minorities, but said that while the Met was \"en route, there's another two miles to go\".</p> <p>Sir Paul Condon said last night that work was in progress on 30 of the 41 recommendations and that the Met's clear-up rate for murders was higher than Paris and Amsterdam.</p> <p>Assistant commissioner Ian Johnston said the report gave a skew-eyed view of the Met's approach to murder, pointing out that the force's senior investigating officers are dedicated to solving murders. In other forces, detectives have to juggle solving murders with other responsibilities.</p> <p>\"There is a national shortage of suitably qualified people to take on the extremely demanding and challenging role of senior investigating officer, but we have an excellent new training package to bring on new staff,\" he said.</p>",

Mr Blakey concluded that \"too many staff are working under pressures which are avoidable and cannot be justified\". This included poorly paid civilian staff, many of whom had been forced to work up to five consecutive weekends. But Mr Blakey recognised that the Met faced greater challenges than any other force and welcomed the increases in staff devoted to murder in recent months. But he was \"extremely concerned that a number of officers interviewed did not believe that the Met regarded the investigation of murder as a priority.\" He added: \"This, coupled with the under resourcing of investigations has contributed to the (Met's) lower than average detection rates.\" He called for a clearer chain of accountability in murder inquiries and a review of forensic evidence gathering processes. Mr Crompton praised some of the initiatives taken by the Met since the Macpherson report, including the setting up of the racial and violent crimes taskforce. But he highlighted continuing problems within the ranks over racist crime investigations. \"There is more to be done in securing the hearts and minds of non-specialist police officers,\" he said. \"A pervasive feeling exists among some staff that what is seen as special treatment for the victims of racist attacks can only be delivered by prejudicing service to the wider community. Until officers and staff understand the impact of hate crime because of skin colour or cultural difference, securing the appropriate initial response to victims will remain an unfulfilled challenge.\" Mr Crompton said it would be \"exceptionally challenging\" for the Met to reach the home office target of 5,662 black and Asian officers by 2010. He said the force needed to concentrate on retaining staff. The inspectors praised the \"energy, leadership and commitment\" of senior officers to improving the service to ethnic minorities, but said that while the Met was \"en route, there's another two miles to go\". Sir Paul Condon said last night that work was in progress on 30 of the 41 recommendations and that the Met's clear-up rate for murders was higher than Paris and Amsterdam. Assistant commissioner Ian Johnston said the report gave a skew-eyed view of the Met's approach to murder, pointing out that the force's senior investigating officers are dedicated to solving murders. In other forces, detectives have to juggle solving murders with other responsibilities. \"There is a national shortage of suitably qualified people to take on the extremely demanding and challenging role of senior investigating officer, but we have an excellent new training package to bring on new staff,\" he said.",

But when a multinational pharmaceuticals firm wants to launch a major new drug, James Dettore often tops the list of people to contact. Dettore, president and chief executive officer of the Miami-based Brand Institute, charges companies including SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome up to $100,000 a time to perfect something that is fast becoming almost as crucial to a drug's success as its very clinical effectiveness: its name. </p> <p>Christening a new treatment used to be a straightforward undertaking. The remedy synthesised by the German chemist Felix Hoffman in 1899 to alleviate his father's rheumatism was called aspirin, simply because it consisted of acetylsalicylic acid based on extracts from the spirea plant - and, until even recently, it seemed strong sales of any new anti-constipation powder could be guaranteed merely by appending \"lax\" to the name on the packet. But now - amid a boom in lifestyle drugs such as Viagra and the baldness treatment Propecia, and with record numbers of British people asking their GPs to prescribe specific treatments - the naming of drugs has ballooned into a global, multi-million-pound industry, with consultancies springing up across Europe and north America to lavish upon newly developed products all the care and attention of parents naming a newborn baby. </p> <p>Dettore and his industry rivals frequent a bizarre parallel universe of strange prefixes and suffixes, of names that hint at miraculous curative properties without incurring the wrath of regulatory agencies by explicitly claiming powers they do not possess. All new drugs receive a generic name, subject to final approval by the World Health Organisation, but it is the trade name, owned by the manufacturer and under which the product is marketed, where naming consultants come into their own. The list of drugs approved in recent months by the European Union and the US Food and Drug Administration sounds like some kind of medieval incantation: Nutropin, Synercid, Ciclopirox, Avelox, Nasonex, Lipitor, Aleve, Aggrenox, Curosurf... </p> <p>The process, which typically lasts around three months, begins with some high-intensity brainstorming sessions among pharmacists, physicians, nurses and consumers, explains Dettore, whose creations include Propecia, the controversial flu drug Relenza and the cholesterol treatment Lipitor. There are some basic rules at Brand Institute: the perfect name is held to consist of 10 letters or fewer, and no more than three syllables. </p> <p>But much depends on changing fashions. Where once drugs companies chose chemical and latinate names that blinded the public with science, the turn of the century is witnessing a shift in the direction of airy, abstract names embodying hope and wellness and the promise of transformation. \"In most cases, companies are now leaning away from names that are compound-driven and derived,\" says Dettore. \"In the late 1980s, the US tendency was to use names indicative of the product's attributes and benefits, but the UK has always used this more arbitrary, personality- driven strategy. It's an attempt to invoke an essence of the brand.\" </p> <p>Some of the drugs at the forefront of these changing trends make bold, brash claims for their own efficacy: Zyban, an anti-depressant aimed at people trying to quit smoking, overtly implies that it will \"ban\" their habit, while the name of stomach-acid treatment Prevacid is essentially self-explanatory. </p> <p>Some seek out favourable euphonic associations, as in the vigour and virility of Viagra, or the implictly miraculous powers of the Parkinson's drug Mirapex. Others opt for an altogether more subtle approach. The antibiotic Vantin hints at advantage, while Prozac, naming consultants insist, carries the suggestion of the \"exact\" targetting of brain functions. And that upbeat prefix \"pro\" never goes amiss: \"There are currently more than 4,000 'pro' prefix names in the various registries,\" Dettore says, despondently: every one that is already registered is another that he cannot use. </p> <p>Adopting a ruse beloved of taxi operators, pharmaceuticals firms frequently opt for names beginning with A (recent examples include the insomnia remedy Ambien and the asthma treatment Accolate) so that they are placed near the beginning of drugs formularies. The especially devious seize the opportunity to piggyback on existing brands by borrowing parts of their names; Dettore cites the case of Abbot Laboratories' Aids drug Norvir, with its echoes of Glaxo's AZT brand Retrovir. \"You have to ask yourself whether you really want to develop a truly unique name, or use a me-too strategy, to try to link to an existing market and ride on the coat-tails of another product,\" he says. </p> <p>Devising an evocative name is only the first hurdle. Once it has been formulated, the consultancies call in linguistics experts to check that names are pronounceable worldwide and don't have obscene or embarrassing meanings in other languages: nobody wants a repeat performance of the brand-namers' favourite fiasco, the Vauxhall Nova - a car whose name means something close to \"doesn't go\" in an uncomfortably large number of tongues. </p> <p>But by far the costliest part of the exercise involves hiring armies of lawyers to sift through trademark registries and medical regulations across the globe, to make sure that the name does not contravene consumer legislation or infringe existing marks - of which there are more than 1m in the relevant category in the European Union alone. </p> <p>Choosing a name too similar to an existing one can bring more than legal pitfalls. Confusion between Merck's gastrointestinal drug Losec and the antihypertension treatment Lasix, manufactured by Hoechst, caused sufficient concern in the US for the FDA to order Merck to change it to Prilosec - though some American doctors are now reporting potentially hazardous mistaking of Prilosec for Prozac. Unsubstantiable claims can also lead to conflict: it was the FDA, again, that scuppered Pharmacia and Upjohn's plans to market its minoxidil baldness treatment as Regaine, on the basis that it didn't really stimulate permanent hair regrowth, and the name was changed to Rogaine. By contrast, in Britain - where the regulatory framework consists of a mishmash of agencies including the Medicines Control Agency, which has the main responsibility for authorising trade names - minoxidil is still available as Regaine, and Losec and Lasix continue to be distributed under their original names. </p> <p>Despite the regulatory maze that multinationals must negotiate, consumer groups fear too many names still make significantly misleading claims for the efficacy of their products. \"What the companies have tried to do is come up with a smooth-sounding name, overstate the benefits and understate the risks,\" Sidney Wolfe, co-founder of America's Public Citizens Health Research Group, has said. </p> <p>\"Naming is becoming more and more complicated,\" says Dettore. \"Increasingly, in trying to create unique names, firms come up with words that aren't scriptable, or that no one can pronounce, so it's sometimes easier to take an existing root than to try to create an entirely new identity. </p> <p>\"A lot of people are saying we might even run out of names,\" he adds, with just a hint of worry in his voice.</p>",

The atmosphere after dinner, when the pangs are at their fiercest, suggests a catholic pub in Glasgow in the hours after Celtic have lost heavily to Rangers. \"What are you looking at?\" Rebecca asks when I glance towards her, hoping to gauge from her features that she is suffering more than me. \"Nothing. Care to make something of it?\" \"Oh yeah? And what if I do...\" And so it goes on, in classic Govan style, albeit that where Rab C Nesbitt would have offered me \"Outside\" my wife offers a wintry \"Goodnight\" and floats icily up to bed. </p> <p><strong> Wednesday </strong></p> <p> Although the physical craving begins to fade as the nicotine works its way out of the bloodstream, such is the psychological torment that only the operation on my deviated septum on January 28 keeps me going. Major surgery is particularly perilous, it goes without saying, for the heavy smoker. </p> <p> <strong>Thursday </strong></p> <p> The third worst thing about giving up smoking (after not being able to smoke, and the guilt at leaving former brethren to fund what remains of the NHS on their own) is the unmasking of symptoms that were suppressed by the chemicals. Today, for example, I'm suffering not only mouth ulcers, throat soreness and tongue inflammation, but also an infuriating tickly cough from somewhere deep in the chest that comes on late at night and prevents sleep. </p> <p><strong> Friday </strong></p> <p> In Tesco I bump into Dr Beverly MacDonald, whose small ops clinic I hope to attend (to have the spot on my nose frozen off with liquid nitrogen), if I come through the septum operation. She asks how I am - something she instantly regrets, to judge by the flash of panic that illuminates her eyes. I mention the cough, and ask if she thinks it might be emphysema. She says that at my age it is unlikely, \"but if it's troubling you, come to the emergency clinic tomorrow\". Emergency? You know something, doctor, don't you? Assuring me she knows nothing, the doctor points her trolley towards table sauces and is gone. </p> <p><strong> Saturday </strong></p> <p> I wish I had gone to the emergency clinic. All the time, the source of the tickle feels deeper in the lung. With every breath more coughing ensues. I begin to fear mesothelioma, a terminal tumour of the chest cavity. I check my proof copy of the Bloke's Diagnose-It-Yourself Guide to Health, an excellent new reference book (my physician Sarah Jarvis , who is writing the \"girlie version\", tells me it is published this week) but one aimed at men with less specialist knowledge than myself. There is no word about it. </p> <p> <strong>Sunday </strong></p> <p> Marital relations take another dive when Rebecca catches me rooting through her bag. \"You're searching for my address book, aren't you, to ring Sarah Jarvis?\" Reluctantly confirming this, I point out my fears about lung cancer. \"For God's sake,\" she says, \"you know I've got exactly the same thing. Does the fact that we've got the same cough at the same time suggest anything?\" \"You think you've got mesothelioma too?\" Sullenly, she dials the doctor to arrange my usual Monday slot at 6.20pm, and then retires to the top of the house. </p> <p><strong> Monday </strong></p> <p> At the Grove surgery, some organisational fiasco causes Dr Jarvis to summon me at precisely 6.20. After she expresses amazement that \"you do not have, or claim to have, this nasty flu\", I present my symptoms, perform coughs, allow her to listen to my chest and state the diagnosis. \"Mesothelioma?\" she says. \"But you get that from exposure to asbestos. Have you been exposed to asbestos?\" \"Yes.\" She looks up sharply. \"When?\" she says. \"In chemistry, when we were using a Bunsen bur...\" \"It's a cough,\" she says, \"probably brought on by giving up smoking.\" Dr Jarvis is pointing to her door. \"Out,\" she says. It seems a good moment to excuse myself, and head back to the clean but cool air of the marital home.</p>",

She says that at my age it is unlikely, \"but if it's troubling you, come to the emergency clinic tomorrow\". Emergency? You know something, doctor, don't you? Assuring me she knows nothing, the doctor points her trolley towards table sauces and is gone. Saturday I wish I had gone to the emergency clinic. All the time, the source of the tickle feels deeper in the lung. With every breath more coughing ensues. I begin to fear mesothelioma, a terminal tumour of the chest cavity. I check my proof copy of the Bloke's Diagnose-It-Yourself Guide to Health, an excellent new reference book (my physician Sarah Jarvis , who is writing the \"girlie version\", tells me it is published this week) but one aimed at men with less specialist knowledge than myself. There is no word about it. Sunday Marital relations take another dive when Rebecca catches me rooting through her bag. \"You're searching for my address book, aren't you, to ring Sarah Jarvis?\" Reluctantly confirming this, I point out my fears about lung cancer. \"For God's sake,\" she says, \"you know I've got exactly the same thing. Does the fact that we've got the same cough at the same time suggest anything?\" \"You think you've got mesothelioma too?\" Sullenly, she dials the doctor to arrange my usual Monday slot at 6.20pm, and then retires to the top of the house. Monday At the Grove surgery, some organisational fiasco causes Dr Jarvis to summon me at precisely 6.20. After she expresses amazement that \"you do not have, or claim to have, this nasty flu\", I present my symptoms, perform coughs, allow her to listen to my chest and state the diagnosis. \"Mesothelioma?\" she says. \"But you get that from exposure to asbestos. Have you been exposed to asbestos?\" \"Yes.\" She looks up sharply. \"When?\" she says. \"In chemistry, when we were using a Bunsen bur...\" \"It's a cough,\" she says, \"probably brought on by giving up smoking.\" Dr Jarvis is pointing to her door. \"Out,\" she says. It seems a good moment to excuse myself, and head back to the clean but cool air of the marital home.",

I got through so many packets that I frequently jumped off the Tube mid-journey to work because I could no longer wait for fresh supplies. </p> <p>By the time my pregnancy was confirmed, at about six weeks, the nausea was overwhelming and even two pounds of gums a day were failing to help. The gastric effects of sailing through a mountainous Bay of Biscay in a force 10 gale had nothing on the sickness engulfing me by now - not just in the morning, but afternoons, evenings and nights, too. </p> <p>Then the vomiting began. Everything came back up - from dry toast, to plain biscuits, to a mere sip of water. I was sick not only through my mouth some 25 to 30 times a day - but often through my nose, too. I struggled in to see my GP, having been sick in her car park, her waiting room loo and very nearly on the yucca plant next to her desk, pleading for help. </p> <p>Her response was that morning sickness was normal in pregnancy, and that, anyway, as I was moving, my new GP should take on my case. Chastened, I returned to work but barely surfaced from the ladies' loo once again. By the next day, eight weeks on, I had kept down no water for 36 hours, my limbs were trembling, my lips parched and my skin leathery. </p> <p>I pleaded with the doctor, in the area where I was to move to in four months time, to see me. Just one look at the wreck in front of her and she sent me to a specialist emergency clinic at Queen Charlotte's maternity hospital in west London. I stopped the taxi during the short journey between her surgery and the hospital no fewer than eight times to vomit. </p> <p>Once there, an enormously patient male doctor took my details from the other side of the door in the bathroom where I had had to ensconce myself. I emerged finally, looking 30 years older than usual, to be met with a flurry of doctors and nurses and the first acknowledgement that this might be a bit more than run of the mill. </p> <p>First off was an emergency scan - interrupted twice by mad dashes to the loo - to try to find the problem. No, I wasn't expecting twins (which can cause terrible sickness) and nor were there any other visible causes. Indeed, there in the centre of the picture was a strong, regular, pulsating white light - my son's heartbeat, and a sight so wondrous, it convinced me that whatever happened would be worth it just to save it. </p> <p>I was taken upstairs to a ward and connected to a saline drip to re-hydrate me, and was given powerful anti-emetic injections to stop me being sick. My tearful protests about the dangers of drugs in pregnancy, and particularly anti-morning sickness ones in the wake of thalidomide, were met with reassurances about the relative safety of modern versions - and a warning that I had no choice if I wanted to keep the baby. </p> <p>In effect, they explained, I was allergic to pregnancy. My body was at war with the key pregnancy hormone Beta HCG and its line of attack was constant vomiting to try to get rid of it. The only way to go was to restrict potential damage to both of us by reducing the vomiting. Wired up to the drip and drugged to the eyeballs, I was later able to enjoy my first two-hour blissful break from being sick in a fortnight. Five days later, I left hospital weak and nauseous but with the vomiting under control. But over the next three weeks, it slowly built up again, even more corrosively this time. It felt like I was drowning in nausea. </p> <p>Spring is my favourite season, but that year the colours of the spring flowers all faded into grey and beige and everything I tried to eat tasted of metal. Once again, water would not stay down and I was rushed into hospital for another bout of treatment. Now five months pregnant, I returned to work and prayed the phone wouldn't ring on my desk, as moving to answer it would make me sick. I prayed no one would speak to me, as speaking made me sick. And then I hoped I wouldn't have to leave my desk, as walking made me dizzy - until one day the floor appeared to rise up and a blackness descended. </p> <p>Another trip to the doctor unearthed high sugar levels in my urine - a sign of diabetes, and possibly brought on by my unprecedented consumption levels of American hard gums, as well as the erratic nourishment my body had been getting. </p> <p>At 34 weeks, feeling like a zombie and at my wits' end, my waters broke. It was one of the most dramatic moments of my life. Not only was there water everywhere but the nausea and the vomiting stopped instantaneously - that very second. I felt hungry for the first time for seven and a half months and, although urged to go straight to hospital, I insisted on eating one of the biggest meals of my life. </p> <p> I had second helpings of my mother's homemade hamburgers, mashed potato and leeks (a childhood favourite) and second helpings of apple crumble (another) as well. And still I wanted more, the sheer joy of tasting food and the freedom from nausea made me want to laugh and laugh - and eat and eat. </p> <p>At last, we drove to the hospital, where I was kept in until an infection brought on early labour four days later. I was warned that waters breaking that early are almost certain to spark infection but that it was important to keep the baby inside me for every hour possible. </p> <p>I sat and ate to my heart's content. NHS fare tasted like Michelin-rated cuisine. I was pregnant and at last I felt great to be alive. Then on the fourth morning, I woke with pains in my knees and I vomited again. Slowly the pains spread and my temperature soared. The midwives monitored the baby's heartbeat and I could see long faces all around. </p> <p>My partner, Jonathan, arrived after the mild contractions began. I was ordered to stay in bed, until suddenly my son's heartbeat started to falter. They pushed me and my bed out to the lift to the surgical floor at breakneck speed but it failed to arrive. When we finally got to the delivery suite, no one was smiling. We were given five minutes to see if there was an improvement. There was none. </p> <p>There was more running and I was told it would have to be general anaesthetic for the operation, as it worked quicker than an epidural and the baby had to come out now. My last memory is of a man in a dark jacket, I presume the anaesthetist, complaining he had not had time to change before attending to me. </p> <p>Sometime later I awoke in huge pain: when the anaesthetic wears off there is little to protect you from the searing wound in your abdomen. As it was an emergency, they had had to shove a tube down my throat to clear my stomach before operating, and it had taken my voice away. My only mode of communication was to draw the letters P-A-I-N with a finger on my palm. After what seemed like an age they brought some morphine, and my partner told me we had a perfect little boy. I was so dopey I never asked where he was, or if I could see him. </p> <p>That night I slept next to the operating theatre, dreaming strange drug-induced dreams of fields and flowers. At six sharp the next morning, I was given a bed bath by two midwives while a couple of floors down my son was also being given a wash and brush-up.

Despite being six weeks early, his birth weight was a respectable five and a half pounds, and he looked like a giant compared with the minute little ones in the special care unit where he stayed for two nights for observation, and a course of prophylactic antibiotics. He looked so gorgeous, I wondered whether he was really mine. Could there not have been a mix-up in the furore surrounding his birth? </p> <p>My fears of associating him with all the pain and suffering have been completely unfounded.

Roy Porter, himself no stranger to monumental histories, made a powerful case for the defence in the Times: </p> <p>\"The Isles is a masterwork, particularly memorable for its concluding survey of centrifugal forces in a late 20th-century Britain where there are more Muslims than Methodists. Precisely three years ago, there appeared Davies's Europe: A History. The Isles forms a fine companion: encyclopaedic, provocatively argued, and enhanced by generous quotations from works of literature in all the Isles' tongues.\"</p> <p>Nor was he alone in forgiving Davies his occasional errors. Hugo Young, concluding a magisterial survey of the state of the nation in the London Review of Books, also found in the professor's favour: </p> <p>\"This is not a handing-down from on high, but an investigation of new territory by someone who wants to explore hypotheses he apprehends but is not sure of. We can therefore share his own fascination at what he finds ... Messy and subjective though it is, and unwilling to allow merit to the perspective of almost any other historian, The Isles is a key book for its time. It seizes the conventional wisdom of the moment, and destroys most of its foundations.\"</p> <p>So, case far from proven, unless the anti-Davies faction can obtain incriminating taped evidence from that original publisher's lunch (\"you'll knock off the Reformation in no time, Norman, and the first world war will be over by Christmas\") or induce Toby and Caroline to come clean.</p>",

Roy Porter, himself no stranger to monumental histories, made a powerful case for the defence in the Times: \"The Isles is a masterwork, particularly memorable for its concluding survey of centrifugal forces in a late 20th-century Britain where there are more Muslims than Methodists. Precisely three years ago, there appeared Davies's Europe: A History. The Isles forms a fine companion: encyclopaedic, provocatively argued, and enhanced by generous quotations from works of literature in all the Isles' tongues.\" Nor was he alone in forgiving Davies his occasional errors. Hugo Young, concluding a magisterial survey of the state of the nation in the London Review of Books, also found in the professor's favour: \"This is not a handing-down from on high, but an investigation of new territory by someone who wants to explore hypotheses he apprehends but is not sure of. We can therefore share his own fascination at what he finds ... Messy and subjective though it is, and unwilling to allow merit to the perspective of almost any other historian, The Isles is a key book for its time. It seizes the conventional wisdom of the moment, and destroys most of its foundations.\" So, case far from proven, unless the anti-Davies faction can obtain incriminating taped evidence from that original publisher's lunch (\"you'll knock off the Reformation in no time, Norman, and the first world war will be over by Christmas\") or induce Toby and Caroline to come clean.",

      "bodyText": "The home office hit back at the \"paranoid and unreal\" complaints of freedom of information campaigners today, after it emerged that home secretary Jack Straw had granted himself new powers to veto the release of any public documents. Home office minister Mike O'Brien said that the amendment to the government's freedom of information bill was a purely technical matter and did not undermine its commitment to openness. \"The whole objective of this bill is to create freedom of information,\" Mr O'Brien insisted. \"That is why we are putting it through parliament.\" The amendment, introduced before Christmas without Commons debate, would allow the home secretary to issue a \"parliamentary order\" to remove any public body from the provisions of the bill. Unless the order was spotted and raised in parliament by an MP within 28 days, it would automatically come into force. Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: \"They may use it in a very modest way to make technical changes but, at the same time, if they find the freedom of information act is an embarrassment and is causing them difficulties, they have the power here to gnaw away the heart of it at a stroke. \"If they need to make substantial changes of this kind, they should use primary legislation to do it and go through proper parliamentary scrutiny.\" Liberal Democrat spokesman on constitutional affairs Robert Maclennan said he would be tabling an amendment to have the proposal removed from the bill. He told Radio 4: \"It is a most unacceptable, widely-based power which could be abused too easily. \"If the secretary of state decides that he can see a difficulty coming down the pipe which could cause the government embarrassment - which the public may know nothing about in advance - he can then move to strike out information of a particular kind held by a public authority.\" Mr O'Brien retorted: \"What both Maurice and Bob seem to be suggesting is that we want to put it through Parliament in order to then reverse it all. That is complete nonsense.\" The purpose of the amendment was to allow the names of new public bodies - such as the inquiry into the death of Stephen Lawrence - to be added to the legislation, and then removed when they ceased to exist, he said. He denied that the use of parliamentary orders would mean that changes could slip through unnoticed: \"The joint committee on statutory instruments considers every one of these and if anything unusual or arbitrary were done by the home secretary - which it would not be - the committee would immediately bring it to the attention of the House.\"",

AOL Time Warner will lead this transformation.\" </p> <p>America Online is only 15 years old, but already boasts 150m users through its various online services and many more users of its Netscape internet browsers - software that revolutionised access to the web. Some 1bn viewers worldwide are believed to have access to CNN, while Time Warner's magazine business reaches 120m readers and its young cable business already has 13m subscribers. </p> <p>Despite the breadth of the deal, the merger partners do not expect any problems in gaining regulatory approval. </p> <p>\"Today's announcement really does change the tectonic plates in this world,\" Christopher Dixon, a media analyst at the US investment bank PaineWebber, said. \"This underscores the strength of the internet ... It's about coming up with ways to use your computer in a TV-like experience.\" </p> <p>Most financial and industry analysts cheered the creation of a new class of digital media company. But rivals urged regulators to ensure consumers have equal access to content such as Time Warner's magazines and TV programmes, even if they do not link with AOL's internet services. </p> <p>Bulletin boards on the web were crammed with complaints from internet users who saw the deal as a blow to the web's freedom from US corporate dominance.</p>",

A series of copy-cat corporate marriages is now forecast in the US and Europe as financiers and entrepreneurs race to bring respected media \"content\" - ranging from TV broadcasting and newspapers to film archives - together with the leading companies of the new information age. In New York commentators speculated on the future of media brands such as CBS and Disney with the frontrunners of the internet industry, such as Yahoo! and even Microsoft. In London there was frenzied dealing on the stock market as investors bet on one or more of Britain's big media groups, such as Pearson or Granada, attempting to take over a UK internet service provider, such as Freeserve. In both the City and Wall Street, the merger was seen as justification for the stratospheric valuations attached to shares in internet and new media companies. The new US media giant brings together a vast array of news and entertainment brands, and one of the US's biggest cable networks, with one of the world's most established internet infrastructures, potentially giving it unheralded power in areas such as e-commerce. AOL Time Warner will be headed by Steve Case, currently chairman and chief executive of America Online, while Time Warner's boss, Gerald Levin, becomes chief executive of the new company. \"This is an historic moment in which new media has truly come of age,\" Mr Case declared yesterday. \"We've always said that America Online's mission is to make the internet as central to people's lives as the telephone and television, and even more valuable. \"By joining forces with Time Warner, we will fundamentally change the way people get information, communicate with others, buy products and are entertained - providing far-reaching benefits to our customers and shareholders.\" Mr Levin added: \"The digital revolution has already begun to create unprecedented and instantaneous access to every form of media and to unleash immense possibilities for economic growth, human understanding and creative expression. AOL Time Warner will lead this transformation.\" America Online is only 15 years old, but already boasts 150m users through its various online services and many more users of its Netscape internet browsers - software that revolutionised access to the web. Some 1bn viewers worldwide are believed to have access to CNN, while Time Warner's magazine business reaches 120m readers and its young cable business already has 13m subscribers. Despite the breadth of the deal, the merger partners do not expect any problems in gaining regulatory approval. \"Today's announcement really does change the tectonic plates in this world,\" Christopher Dixon, a media analyst at the US investment bank PaineWebber, said. \"This underscores the strength of the internet ... It's about coming up with ways to use your computer in a TV-like experience.\" Most financial and industry analysts cheered the creation of a new class of digital media company. But rivals urged regulators to ensure consumers have equal access to content such as Time Warner's magazines and TV programmes, even if they do not link with AOL's internet services. Bulletin boards on the web were crammed with complaints from internet users who saw the deal as a blow to the web's freedom from US corporate dominance.",

      "body": "<p>Hospital waiting lists started to climb steeply yesterday as the continuing flu crisis forced cancellation of non-urgent surgery in operating theatres across the country. </p> <p>Ministers were confident of making good the damage in coming months, but every day that the flu outbreak rages on will throw further doubt on the government's drive to cut the waiting lists. </p> <p>As he told MPs that the official number of people with flu-like symptoms had risen almost fivefold since early last month, Alan Milburn, the health secretary, said many hospitals which had planned to resume routine surgery yesterday had decided to delay until pressures subsided. </p> <p>\"Hospital managers and clinicians will make judgments about how best to balance their workload in light of local experience over the next few weeks,\" the minister said in a Commons statement. </p> <p>\"This approach represents a sensible deployment of NHS staff and resources.\" </p> <p>The government remains committed to a general election promise to cut hospital waiting lists in England by 100,000 by the end of this parliament, although Mr Milburn has sought to deflect attention from this goal, stressing new priorities. </p> <p>Latest published figures show that by the end of last October, the English lists had come down by 79,000.

      "bodyText": "Hospital waiting lists started to climb steeply yesterday as the continuing flu crisis forced cancellation of non-urgent surgery in operating theatres across the country. Ministers were confident of making good the damage in coming months, but every day that the flu outbreak rages on will throw further doubt on the government's drive to cut the waiting lists. As he told MPs that the official number of people with flu-like symptoms had risen almost fivefold since early last month, Alan Milburn, the health secretary, said many hospitals which had planned to resume routine surgery yesterday had decided to delay until pressures subsided. \"Hospital managers and clinicians will make judgments about how best to balance their workload in light of local experience over the next few weeks,\" the minister said in a Commons statement. \"This approach represents a sensible deployment of NHS staff and resources.\" The government remains committed to a general election promise to cut hospital waiting lists in England by 100,000 by the end of this parliament, although Mr Milburn has sought to deflect attention from this goal, stressing new priorities. Latest published figures show that by the end of last October, the English lists had come down by 79,000. But already available November figures for Wales show a 2% monthly increase and no overall improvement over the position 12 months before. Even if English hospitals maintained their improving trend during November, it is almost certain to have ended last month - when routine surgery was largely halted in preparation for any millennium problems - and to be now in sharp reverse. Hospitals in London, Brighton, Bristol, Leeds, Nottingham and Newcastle-upon-Tyne were among those confirming yesterday that they had cancelled non-urgent surgery until further notice. Mr Milburn said hospitals in England had dealt with more than 200,000 emergency admissions in the past three weeks - an increase of 30%. The evidence was that patients were \"more ill than normal\" and were staying in hospital longer than normal. The NHS had risen to the challenge and was coping, the minister said, though it was true that services were \"stretched\". Doctors' leaders joined calls for the government to acknowledge that the flu crisis had exposed a critical shortage of hospital beds. Peter Hawker, who chairs the British Medical Association's consultants' committee, said health care planning had to take proper account of the greater needs of the growing numbers of elderly people. \"It is time we stopped seeing this as an inconvenient extra pressure in winter and recognised that our assumptions about bed numbers need to be built on real need, rather than wishful thinking,\" he said.

En Espa\u00f1a m\u00e1s de un 70 por ciento de los j\u00f3venes se define como cat\u00f3lico, aunque un 55 por ciento no va casi nunca a misa.

Soluciones? Invertir en educaci\u00f3n, por ejemplo, para que los pa\u00edses pobres se desarrollen por ellos mismos. </p> <p><strong> Cristina:</strong> Que la ciencia termine con enfermedades como el c\u00e1ncer o el sida. Y que Internet nos ayude a comunicarnos con m\u00e1s facilidad. Aunque Internet tambi\u00e9n puede convertirnos en robots. Nos estamos destruyendo, nos comunicamos poco y perdemos valores. </p> <p><strong> Gemma:</strong> Solidaridad, acabar con el racismo - pero nadie hace nada. El sistema pol\u00edtico no funciona. La gente se queja pero no hace nada para cambiarlo. Sobre Internet - no me gusta. Es poco \u00fatil y hay demasiadas cosas que no necesitamos. No estimula a los j\u00f3venes.

Lo que est\u00e1 bien est\u00e1 bien siempre, y lo que est\u00e1 mal tambi\u00e9n. La verdad no puede cambiar a gusto del consumidor. No se puede cambiar lo que dijo Jesucristo. Yo voy a misa cada d\u00eda y comulgo con el Opus Dei. La Iglesia debe ser un apoyo, un punto de referencia. Por ejemplo sobre Internet, la Iglesia advierte sobre sus peligros. </p> <p><strong> Cristina:</strong> La Iglesia no puede seguir igual.

      "bodyText": "Reci\u00e9n inaugurado el siglo XXI, los j\u00f3venes espa\u00f1oles esperan que la tecnolog\u00eda sea el motor de los cambios en el futuro. Se declaran, sin embargo, pesimistas. Opinan que los desarrollos cient\u00edficos y tecnol\u00f3gicos tienen una cara negativa: la crisis de los valores, de la sociedad, de la familia y de la educaci\u00f3n. El Vaticano prepara este a\u00f1o el 2.000 aniversario de la Iglesia cat\u00f3lica. Seg\u00fan una encuesta del Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas, del Ministerio de la Presidencia, los j\u00f3venes piensan que la religi\u00f3n es m\u00e1s importante que la pol\u00edtica. En Espa\u00f1a m\u00e1s de un 70 por ciento de los j\u00f3venes se define como cat\u00f3lico, aunque un 55 por ciento no va casi nunca a misa. El Vaticano alerta, entre otras cosas, sobre los peligros de Internet. Seg\u00fan la Iglesia cat\u00f3lica, \"Internet estimula la adicci\u00f3n a las drogas, la prostituci\u00f3n y el sida\". C\u00f3mo ser\u00e1 la vida en el pr\u00f3ximo milenio? Bego\u00f1a Benet (16 a\u00f1os): Mejorar\u00e1 la calidad de vida pero aumentar\u00e1 el consumismo. A nivel tecnol\u00f3gico cambiar\u00e1 todo incluso m\u00e1s r\u00e1pido que en los \u00faltimos veinte a\u00f1os. Cristina Rivera (17 a\u00f1os): La sociedad empeorar\u00e1. Hay mucha libertad y todo el mundo hace lo que le da la gana. Qu\u00e9 esperas del nuevo milenio? Bego\u00f1a: Las diferencias entre pa\u00edses ricos y pa\u00edses pobres aumentar\u00e1n si no les ayudamos. Soluciones? Invertir en educaci\u00f3n, por ejemplo, para que los pa\u00edses pobres se desarrollen por ellos mismos. Cristina: Que la ciencia termine con enfermedades como el c\u00e1ncer o el sida. Y que Internet nos ayude a comunicarnos con m\u00e1s facilidad. Aunque Internet tambi\u00e9n puede convertirnos en robots. Nos estamos destruyendo, nos comunicamos poco y perdemos valores. Gemma: Solidaridad, acabar con el racismo - pero nadie hace nada. El sistema pol\u00edtico no funciona. La gente se queja pero no hace nada para cambiarlo. Sobre Internet - no me gusta. Es poco \u00fatil y hay demasiadas cosas que no necesitamos. No estimula a los j\u00f3venes. Hay demasiados juegos en la red. Est\u00e1 desfasado el Vaticano? Qu\u00e9 papel debe tener la Iglesia cat\u00f3lica y el Papa en la sociedad espa\u00f1ola del futuro? Bego\u00f1a: La Iglesia no est\u00e1 desfasada. Lo que est\u00e1 bien est\u00e1 bien siempre, y lo que est\u00e1 mal tambi\u00e9n. La verdad no puede cambiar a gusto del consumidor. No se puede cambiar lo que dijo Jesucristo. Yo voy a misa cada d\u00eda y comulgo con el Opus Dei. La Iglesia debe ser un apoyo, un punto de referencia. Por ejemplo sobre Internet, la Iglesia advierte sobre sus peligros. Cristina: La Iglesia no puede seguir igual. Debe cambiar sus ideas sobre el divorcio, la eutanasia o el aborto, por ejemplo. No se puede leer la Biblia al pie de la letra. Una cosa es lo que fund\u00f3 Jesucristo y otra el montaje posterior. Hoy la gente no quiere escuchar lo que dice la Iglesia. Y la Iglesia no quiere entender el porqu\u00e9 y escuchar a la gente.

Our research proves that we are already winning a new, younger, more attractive audience. </p> <p>\"talkSPORT will not just appeal to fans but players, managers and everyone involved in the business of sport.\" </p> <p>In a Guardian interview yesterday, Mr MacKenzie, who took over the helm of the five-year-old radio station a year ago, admitted that it had been difficult to stick to his original plan of competing with the BBC on news talk \"because it has so many resources and can send people to far-flung places.\"</p> <p>Broadcasting rights have already been cleared for all England football internationals at Wembley, Manchester United's matches in Europe and all FA Cup round games. </p> <p>But the crunch for the revamped commercial station will come later this year when negotiations open for the radio rights to the FA Premiership from 2001. </p> <p>Radio 5 Live currently holds the rights, but Mr MacKenzie suggested to the Guardian yesterday that a possible flotation of the company could help finance his station's bid for the matches.</p> <p>talkSPORT also boasts the radio rights to England's summer cricket tours, the 2001 and 2005 British Lions rugby tours to New Zealand and Australia, the Trinations rugby tournament between Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and major international boxing matches will also be broadcast live. </p> <p>Mr MacKenzie's presenters include established names such as \"friend of the fans\" Tom Watt, Alan Brazil and former cricketer Geoffrey Boycott as well as newcomers to the station Ian Darke, Brough Scott and Mark Nicholas. </p> <p>In the future, the station's only non-sport output will be the late night phone-ins hosted by veteran talk show presenters James Whale and Ian Collins. </p> <p>Among the main features of his new dedicated sports station will be a four-hour sports breakfast show, a high profile mid-morning sports talk show and a programme geared specifically to lovers of motoring, The Car Guys. </p>",

Our research proves that we are already winning a new, younger, more attractive audience. \"talkSPORT will not just appeal to fans but players, managers and everyone involved in the business of sport.\" In a Guardian interview yesterday, Mr MacKenzie, who took over the helm of the five-year-old radio station a year ago, admitted that it had been difficult to stick to his original plan of competing with the BBC on news talk \"because it has so many resources and can send people to far-flung places.\" Broadcasting rights have already been cleared for all England football internationals at Wembley, Manchester United's matches in Europe and all FA Cup round games. But the crunch for the revamped commercial station will come later this year when negotiations open for the radio rights to the FA Premiership from 2001. Radio 5 Live currently holds the rights, but Mr MacKenzie suggested to the Guardian yesterday that a possible flotation of the company could help finance his station's bid for the matches. talkSPORT also boasts the radio rights to England's summer cricket tours, the 2001 and 2005 British Lions rugby tours to New Zealand and Australia, the Trinations rugby tournament between Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and major international boxing matches will also be broadcast live. Mr MacKenzie's presenters include established names such as \"friend of the fans\" Tom Watt, Alan Brazil and former cricketer Geoffrey Boycott as well as newcomers to the station Ian Darke, Brough Scott and Mark Nicholas. In the future, the station's only non-sport output will be the late night phone-ins hosted by veteran talk show presenters James Whale and Ian Collins. Among the main features of his new dedicated sports station will be a four-hour sports breakfast show, a high profile mid-morning sports talk show and a programme geared specifically to lovers of motoring, The Car Guys.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Even in close up, there is a whisper of the elsewhere about him. As the camera moulds itself to his delicate beauty, what is Johnny Depp conjuring: the anarchic literacy of his Beat heroes; the barfly tempers of a Hollywood anti-icon; the smitten second childhood of a new father? Or is he listening to the Clash? </p> <p>The tiny earpiece transistor was Marlon Brando's suggestion: Depp first used one on the set of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, his bravura homage to Hunter S Thompson. Depp chooses music appropriate to character: most recently harpsichord works for Ichabod Crane, the reluctant leading man of his latest film Sleepy Hollow. But he usually ends up listening to rock. \"There's nothing consistent about a movie set: there's hammering, there's this, there's that, but I have total consistency. I can sit and dream and listen to the music.\" </p> <p>This is being Johnny Depp. Is he for real? Do you want him to be? On balance, I would rather have imagined him. Apply the rigours of reality and he slips away like a dream from wakefulness. His voice is soft and low, his speech trips and strains like a bird learning to fly. He tends towards moonstruck meanderings that mean everything and nothing, like: \"As human beings we break something down to try to understand it, and by breaking it down sometimes you can kill the magic. If there's something that just works, for whatever reason, don't question.\" </p> <p>He is describing his relationship with Tim Burton, the darkly wistful director who presents almost as much of a conundrum to the movie business as Depp himself. Theirs is the success of altered states. </p> <p>Sleepy Hollow, their third collaboration, following Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, is an adaptation of Washington Irvine's classic American ghost story about a small community terrorised by a headless horseman. \"I just know that there's a deep understanding that the two of us can't even begin to talk about. There's a deep connection, and I know that anything he wanted to do I'd be there. I just hope he gives me... another job.\" He laughs, perhaps recognising how ludicrous his final comment sounds. </p> <p>There are some obvious deductions to be made from Depp's choice of roles. With the exception of Scissorhands and Donnie Brasco, he has never starred in a commercial hit. His own directorial debut, The Brave, was slammed at Cannes in 1997. He has consistently played characters on the outskirts of convention: the cross-dressing B-movie director (Ed Wood), the shuffling man-child with blades for fists (Scissorhands), the delusional seducer (Don Juan DeMarco). </p> <p>\"I do have a strange fascination with damaged people, of which I'm one; Christ, who isn't? And I remember very well that feeling in my early teens of being an outsider. I'm not sure it's so much feeling like an outsider as just clearly not being an insider.\" It is obvious that 36-year-old Depp recalls the awkward sensibilities of youth as the rest of us remember yesterday. </p> <p>There are many people who act in life, he says, especially as outsiders. But the roles found him, he insists. It was not a conscious dedication to the maverick - for that is a convention in itself. It is the \"true pedestrian way\" of his literary hero Kerouac. It is equally the final retreat of a scared child. </p> <p>He describes a violent and explosive family life. Born in Owensboro, Kentucky, his parents fought constantly and moved 30 times before his father finally left them when Depp was 15. He dropped out of school to pump gas and play guitar. He drove to LA looking for a record contract and wound up an actor. \"When the homefront went into a tail spin, you needed to believe that somewhere, somehow, something was going to be OK. You had to believe that you just keep moving forward regardless and you'll get to a place where you can breathe better.\" </p> <p>Do we create for our children the childhood that we wish we'd had ourselves? He talks about his baby daughter with raw joy. He wants \"to create everything good\" for Lily-Rose, born last May to Depp and his girlfriend Vanessa Paradis, the French singer, actress and former face of Chanel. Before he has even voiced the thought, invisible strings are tweaking the corners of his bow lips upwards. \"I knew that it was going to be deep, even life-changing, but I didn't have any idea that a person could love that deeply. And when I love - my mother, my family - I love deeply to the very core of my being.\" Love is an odd thing to calibrate. There is a sweetness to him that would be cloying if it were transported beyond his dreamscape. </p> <p>\"When she arrived...\" he pauses. \"I knew her, looking into the eyes of this litle angel,\" - he mimes holding her - \"this little thing that is going to know you deeper than anyone will ever know you.\" He's like an adolescent begging to be taken seriously. He's exposed like a butterfly in glue. He invites one to pull his wings off, then cauterises the impulse to cruelty. </p> <p>Now based in Paris with Paradis and child, he wants \"a simple, normal life\". He would prefer Lily-Rose not to go into acting. \"Nobody puts money into a film bcause they love art, they do it because they want a return on their money, so it's kind of dirty.\" He laughs testingly, like a child telling a smutty joke. \"I've made a career out of commercial failure.\" But he doesn't feel like a failure. \"No, not at all, because it's none of my business what the movies make in terms of money, and really none of the money's going to me.\" (Depp earns a reported $10m per movie.) </p> <p>So what is the difference between commercial success and the kind of success that he enjoys? He doesn't know. But he is very successful. \"In an odd way. Luckily, I've been able to stay afloat. I don't know why that is, because I made choices to go down another avenue that was not particularly solidly paved for you already. But it was the only way I could go, believe me.\" </p> <p>All this is easy to say, if you're Johnny Depp. Responsibility would fade the magic. He finds himself believable: but that he is wholly genuine doesn't make him any less created. He has the sort of excessive beauty that is best understood in still-life. He is exquisite like an object, with the undeveloped charisma of a teenager. He is too bloodless to be sexually threatening. And he is adored for it. </p> <p>He loathes it. Since his early elevation to sparker of teenage dreams as an 80s TV star, he has deliberately mauled his pale heart face on and off screen: with make-up, masks, itchy stubble. \"I despised being a product. Not only is it limiting but it's frustrating, because you have nothing to do with it. I'm much more obsessed with the idea of the truth and exploring than I am with creating an image that I can package and sell to people.\" </p> <p>Does he find his looks are a distraction? \"It's a distraction for me.\" A delicate, observational player, with a fine comic talent, Depp has often been described as a character actor in a leading man's body. \"If you have a leading man type look, they expect you to be a leading man, and I find that impossible.\" It begs two questions: would he be where he is if he didn't look that way? Could Keanu Reeves play a failed film director with an angora fetish, as Depp did in Ed Wood? \"I want to attract as little attention as possible. If I could morph my face for the night it would be one of the greatest gifts I'd ever be given. To be gawked at and treated like some kind of novelty... that's really an ugly feeling.\" </p> <p>During the filming of Sleepy Hollow, Depp confronted a gaggle of paparazzi who were waiting for him outside a London restaurant. \"I said, 'I don't want to be what you want me to be tonight, we're celebrating something special so let's just say we'll do this another time'. And they were aggressive, they said we're going to get the picture so why don't you just pose for it. I'm not going to pose for anybody.\" He sounds like a man for the first time. </p> <p>He picked up a plank of wood and hit one photographer on the hand, threatening the others. \"Nobody took a picture,\" he concludes, grinning dopily at the punchline: \"Not until the cops came. </p> <p>\"I don't regret that at all. I was invaded, and I have to protect what is mine, and keep it as pure as possible.\" </p> <p>During the interview, Depp kept returning to a \"deep\" passage by American playwright and novelist William Saroyan that, he said, encapsulated the values he hopes to pass on to his daughter. He became frustrated at his inability to quote it verbatim and promised to fax me a copy. I dismissed this as professional friendliness and didn't believe him. </p> <p>When I returned to the office, there it was, with an accompanying note: \"Here's the Saroyan piece that I butchered for you today. Hope you like it, it is everything to me.\" It was a genuine, human gesture from a young man with an obviously good heart. The passage itself is one of those Desiderata-style invocations that one makes one's motto before circumstance shakes the innocence out of you. </p> <p>Johnny Depp is a star. He is as much dreamt as dreamer. Reality militates against him, so he remains in the fairy-tale because he can. Would you want him anywhere else? </p> <p>I'm keeping that fax, because I like to believe in magic.</p>",

Ricardinho had gone some way to calming the frenzied atmosphere with the opener after 25 minutes but Daniel did the home cause no favours when he was sent off after 68 minutes for a second bookable offence. However, despite being a man short, Corinthians piled forward and they were finally rewarded when Colombian veteran Rincon fired the ball home.",

Both groups will then cross-promote each other's content. Both sides were yesterday stressing the importance of the timing of the deal. Yesterday was 10 years to the day after Time Warner was formed following the combination of Time Inc and Warner Communications, a merger which brought the old world of printed news together with the faster growing entertainment industry. </p> <p>For many yesterday was also the first full business week of the new \"internet century\". \"This is an historic moment in which new media has truly come of age,\" said Case. \"We've always said that America Online's mission is to make the internet as central to people's lives as the telephone and television, and even more valuable, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to turn this promise into reality.\" </p> <p>Case, now reckoned to be the most important manager in cyberspace, first raised the idea of a \"merger of equals\" in a phone call to Levin last October. The call - at around the same time as Viacom and CBS announced their merger to create one of the world's largest media companies - was breathtaking in having most of the important details already worked out. Levin, a 59-year-old dealmaker, said Case immediately offered him the post of chief executive of the new group. Case will take responsibility for overall strategy and deal-making in his role as company chairman. </p> <p>Levin said yesterday that he was immediately impressed by this offer to \"digitally transform Time Warner\". He was particularly attracted by the chance to link up with these \"bright, impressive, hip, new media-oriented types\". However, the deal floundered for the next month as it became obvious that the stock market put a far greater value on these hip types than those employed by an old media group. </p> <p><strong> Biggest fears</strong><br> </p> <p> Throughout November, AOL's share price rocketed and made Time Warner nervous about its valuation. Although the old media group made almost $27bn in revenues last year, compared with less than $5bn by AOL, the internet company is worth at least 1.5 times what the old media group is in the stock market. Amid the celebratory tone yesterday, the biggest fears raised were over the reaction of AOL's shareholders, now saddled with a slower growing media giant. </p> <p>Under yesterday's deal these shareholders will own 55% of the combined group with Time Warner shareholders owning the rest. If the deal is approved by shareholders and regulators, the biggest problem could come from a clash of cultures. Levin's decision to be the only senior executive of the new group not to wear a tie at yesterday's New York presentation prompted one analyst to exclaim that he had \"gone internet\". </p> <p>Levin also could not help pointing out the unusual nature of a company \"with both Steve Case and Ted Turner as executives\". Turner, the high-profile founder of CNN, owns 9% of Time Warner and will become deputy chairman of the new group. After the tie-up, his wife, Jane Fonda, from whom Turner has separated will be in line for up to $500m in a divorce settlement. </p> <p>The deal is likely to set off a new wave of mergers between media and technology companies. But it could also worry regulators around the world, worried about the dominance of a handful of companies controlling information and how that information reaches people. </p> <p>Both executives played down that threat yesterday and said they would work at opening up access to both rich and poor. Bob Pittman, the co-chief operating officer of the new group, said the merger would allow the company to expand more internationally. </p> <p>\"It is no coincidence that last year was the first in which the number of internet users abroad has outpaced that of the US,\" he said. Yesterday's takeover of Time Warner showed how far the world has moved in the 10 years since the company was formed. In 1989 the internet was hardly used outside a small band of academics and business people, now it is set to become a mass market medium.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A gaggle of children descended on Manchester United's training ground yesterday to demonstrate their skills and bang samba drums. Given Sir Alex Ferguson's approach to South Melbourne this evening, they must have hoped for a place on the bench at least. </p> <p>Having failed to take first prize this year, Ferguson will invest in the future tonight. Six of his side are under 23 and the manager will not weep if they go out of the tournament. He has his Worthington Cup hat on. It is the taking part not the winning which counts. </p> <p>\"I think the fans are looking for them to win and go through,\" the coach Jim Ryan said. \"But we are looking to see if the players can be top players.\" As Ferguson said: \"We know they have got the ability; we look for their character and temperament.\" </p> <p>He cares little about coming third and in any case victory tonight may not be enough. United can progress only if they win and Necaxa lose to Vasco straight afterwards. Goal difference would decide it then. United are currently four goals worse off than the Mexican side. </p> <p>United are strong up front with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and the captain Andy Cole. But elsewhere there are players who might go unspotted in the Old Trafford megastore. Mark Wilson, Jon Greening, Quinton Fortune and Ronnie Wallwork have six starts between them this season. Wonderfully, there is a Higginbotham (Danny) alongside a Cruyff (sadly Jordi). </p> <p>\"They're good players,\" Ferguson said. \"With the side I've got it's difficult for a young player to break in. But when they get a chance there's a challenge for them. Some young players emerge and can't be shifted.\" </p> <p>The first team contains plenty of examples of that. But apart from the unfortunate Wes Brown, no one has come through to hold down a first-team place since Phil Neville and David Beckham in 1995-96. </p> <p>The League Cup games against Port Vale and Newcastle in 1994 showed Ferguson what several of his current crop might do. He hopes to see his assessment of Wallwork, a 5ft 10in centre-half, strengthened tonight. </p> <p>\"He's definitely a Manchester United player,\" Ferguson said. \"He's a good reader of the game, a good passer of the ball. He's tough mentally. I look forward to him. There's maybe that question mark with his height but he's a competitor. Brucey [Steve Bruce] wasn't the tallest. They survive either because they can read the game or because they compete well enough in the air.\" </p> <p>The 22-year-old is certainly a competitor. Last year, on loan at Antwerp, he was banned for life for assaulting a referee. On appeal his sentence was reduced to 12 months, applicable only in Belgium. Higginbotham served a four-month ban for the same incident. \"It was a big relief,\" Wallwork said. \"I'm enjoying my football now.\" </p> <p>Ferguson's decision to rest his stars is understandable with more important tests ahead. The sun and relaxation will do them good. He wants his youngsters to experience the Maracana and knows the loyalty and spirit a youth system breeds.

      "bodyText": "A gaggle of children descended on Manchester United's training ground yesterday to demonstrate their skills and bang samba drums. Given Sir Alex Ferguson's approach to South Melbourne this evening, they must have hoped for a place on the bench at least. Having failed to take first prize this year, Ferguson will invest in the future tonight. Six of his side are under 23 and the manager will not weep if they go out of the tournament. He has his Worthington Cup hat on. It is the taking part not the winning which counts. \"I think the fans are looking for them to win and go through,\" the coach Jim Ryan said. \"But we are looking to see if the players can be top players.\" As Ferguson said: \"We know they have got the ability; we look for their character and temperament.\" He cares little about coming third and in any case victory tonight may not be enough. United can progress only if they win and Necaxa lose to Vasco straight afterwards. Goal difference would decide it then. United are currently four goals worse off than the Mexican side. United are strong up front with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and the captain Andy Cole. But elsewhere there are players who might go unspotted in the Old Trafford megastore. Mark Wilson, Jon Greening, Quinton Fortune and Ronnie Wallwork have six starts between them this season. Wonderfully, there is a Higginbotham (Danny) alongside a Cruyff (sadly Jordi). \"They're good players,\" Ferguson said. \"With the side I've got it's difficult for a young player to break in. But when they get a chance there's a challenge for them. Some young players emerge and can't be shifted.\" The first team contains plenty of examples of that. But apart from the unfortunate Wes Brown, no one has come through to hold down a first-team place since Phil Neville and David Beckham in 1995-96. The League Cup games against Port Vale and Newcastle in 1994 showed Ferguson what several of his current crop might do. He hopes to see his assessment of Wallwork, a 5ft 10in centre-half, strengthened tonight. \"He's definitely a Manchester United player,\" Ferguson said. \"He's a good reader of the game, a good passer of the ball. He's tough mentally. I look forward to him. There's maybe that question mark with his height but he's a competitor. Brucey [Steve Bruce] wasn't the tallest. They survive either because they can read the game or because they compete well enough in the air.\" The 22-year-old is certainly a competitor. Last year, on loan at Antwerp, he was banned for life for assaulting a referee. On appeal his sentence was reduced to 12 months, applicable only in Belgium. Higginbotham served a four-month ban for the same incident. \"It was a big relief,\" Wallwork said. \"I'm enjoying my football now.\" Ferguson's decision to rest his stars is understandable with more important tests ahead. The sun and relaxation will do them good. He wants his youngsters to experience the Maracana and knows the loyalty and spirit a youth system breeds. What he fears for is the future. \"I don't think the academy system is good enough,\" he said. \"You can't sign a boy out with an hour and a half of Old Trafford. We're trying to produce teams that can play in Europe and we are operating from a parochial system. That eventually catches up. That's why we are looking all over the world now for young players.\" South Melbourne's captain Paul Trimboli said he was upset United would not be fielding their full-strength side. \"They're huge,\" said his team-mate John Anastasiadis, a petrol pump attendant. \"They're in the papers back home more than us.\" Off the field, the FA said it would consider bidding to host the tournament in future. \"Our belief is that there is logic behind the development of the World Club Championship,\" said the executive director David Davies. \"Clearly there is an issue in terms of the timing of the tournament and that's very closely tied up with the international calendar, which must be resolved. But in terms of England hosting the event in the future it is not discounted at all.\" Manchester United (4-4-2): Van der Gouw; P Neville, Berg, Wallwork, Higginbotham; Greening, Cruyff, Wilson, Fortune; Cole, Solskjaer.",

Previously loyal newspapers are fracturing the consensus by starting to reveal bad news from the front line and lambasting the perceived ineptitude of political and military leaders. The launching of the Chechen war - and tight government news management of the campaign - have been central to the swift rise to power of Vladimir Putin, the prime minister and acting president, who hopes to be elected Boris Yeltsin's successor in March. But the sudden breakdown of the media consensus combined with the turn for the worse in what is clearly identified as Mr Putin's war could spell trouble for a leader who has staked his political prospects on this conflict. The state-controlled television station ORT continued yesterday to put the best possible gloss on Russian setbacks in Chechnya.

      "body": "<p>For a bestselling author who wrote more than 120 books, many of them lengthy historical novels, Nigel Tranter, who has died aged 90, employed an unusual means of literary creation. Each morning he would leave his house in East Lothian and begin a long walk over the nature reserve at nearby Aberlady Bay. As he stalked out along the shoreline he was an unmistakable figure. In stout boots, flat cap and sensible tweeds, he looked just like any other bird-watcher but for one oddity: in his hands he carried small sheets of paper, protected by a polythene bag in inclement weather. </p> <p>By the time he returned home some 12 miles later, he would have completed another 1,000 words of his next book. Then, with few corrections, the work would be typed up on a venerable Imperial typewriter to form part of his rich harvest of popular novels. He was carrying out the same routine into his 90th year, defying both the uncertain Scottish climate and the vagaries of literary fashion. His last novel, Envoy Extraordinary, was published just two months ago and there were others on the stocks. For those who knew him, and he cast his net widely, it is difficult to believe that this hardy battler should have succumbed to the current flu epidemic. </p> <p>Tranter once told me that he began the habit of writing on the hoof when he was serving in the army during the second world war and privacy was almost impossible. But his method was more than the mere continuation of an early habit. Not only did he relish long walks over hard terrain, but he had a countryman's eye, and his ability to delineate the landscape in all weathers did much to enrich his prose. </p> <p>His tenacity also encouraged him to take infinite pains with the research that went into books about characters as diverse as St Columba, Macbeth, William Wallace, King Robert the Bruce and the Marquis of Montrose. In that respect, Tranter could be compared to Sir Walter Scott, another who was passionately concerned with the presentation of Scottish history. </p> <p>Born in Glasgow, Tranter was educated in Edinburgh, at George Heriot's school. After his father lost money in an unwise investment, he was obliged to follow a solid middle-class career in accountancy, but even then his heart was straying else where. Whenever he had time, he would cycle into the countryside, taking with him an artist's notepad and a vivid imagination. Entirely self-taught but unyielding in his determination to record the great architectural heritage of Scotland's Lowland baronial houses, Tranter used those expeditions to garner the material for his first book, The Fortalices and Early Mansions of Southern Scotland 1400-1650, which was published in 1937 (fortalices are small forts). </p> <p>Although its publication persuaded him to follow a literary career, the war and the need to bring up a young family in the 1950s meant that his early novels were little more than potboilers, hurried and often uneven. But all the while he was honing his style to the useful instrument which would produce his most successful work, a trilogy of novels about King Robert the Bruce - The Steps to the Empty Throne (1969), The Path of the Hero King (1970) and The Price of the King's Peace (1971). Together they sold more than 1m copies. After that success, Tranter's output continued to be prodigious; he was writing at least two books a year. Admittedly, some betrayed the shortcomings of writing at speed, and critics complained about stilted dialogue and a certain discomfort in dealing with relations between the sexes, but none could gainsay his historical accuracy. His novel The Wallace (1975) is admirably free of anything to do with Braveheart, and The Wisest Fool (1974) is a well-judged and sympathetic portrait of King James I of Great Britain. </p> <p>At the same time, he found the energy to complete the five volumes of The Fortified House in Scotland (1962-1971), which proved to be a worthy successor to his first work.

      "bodyText": "For a bestselling author who wrote more than 120 books, many of them lengthy historical novels, Nigel Tranter, who has died aged 90, employed an unusual means of literary creation. Each morning he would leave his house in East Lothian and begin a long walk over the nature reserve at nearby Aberlady Bay. As he stalked out along the shoreline he was an unmistakable figure. In stout boots, flat cap and sensible tweeds, he looked just like any other bird-watcher but for one oddity: in his hands he carried small sheets of paper, protected by a polythene bag in inclement weather. By the time he returned home some 12 miles later, he would have completed another 1,000 words of his next book. Then, with few corrections, the work would be typed up on a venerable Imperial typewriter to form part of his rich harvest of popular novels. He was carrying out the same routine into his 90th year, defying both the uncertain Scottish climate and the vagaries of literary fashion. His last novel, Envoy Extraordinary, was published just two months ago and there were others on the stocks. For those who knew him, and he cast his net widely, it is difficult to believe that this hardy battler should have succumbed to the current flu epidemic. Tranter once told me that he began the habit of writing on the hoof when he was serving in the army during the second world war and privacy was almost impossible. But his method was more than the mere continuation of an early habit. Not only did he relish long walks over hard terrain, but he had a countryman's eye, and his ability to delineate the landscape in all weathers did much to enrich his prose. His tenacity also encouraged him to take infinite pains with the research that went into books about characters as diverse as St Columba, Macbeth, William Wallace, King Robert the Bruce and the Marquis of Montrose. In that respect, Tranter could be compared to Sir Walter Scott, another who was passionately concerned with the presentation of Scottish history. Born in Glasgow, Tranter was educated in Edinburgh, at George Heriot's school. After his father lost money in an unwise investment, he was obliged to follow a solid middle-class career in accountancy, but even then his heart was straying else where. Whenever he had time, he would cycle into the countryside, taking with him an artist's notepad and a vivid imagination. Entirely self-taught but unyielding in his determination to record the great architectural heritage of Scotland's Lowland baronial houses, Tranter used those expeditions to garner the material for his first book, The Fortalices and Early Mansions of Southern Scotland 1400-1650, which was published in 1937 (fortalices are small forts). Although its publication persuaded him to follow a literary career, the war and the need to bring up a young family in the 1950s meant that his early novels were little more than potboilers, hurried and often uneven. But all the while he was honing his style to the useful instrument which would produce his most successful work, a trilogy of novels about King Robert the Bruce - The Steps to the Empty Throne (1969), The Path of the Hero King (1970) and The Price of the King's Peace (1971). Together they sold more than 1m copies. After that success, Tranter's output continued to be prodigious; he was writing at least two books a year. Admittedly, some betrayed the shortcomings of writing at speed, and critics complained about stilted dialogue and a certain discomfort in dealing with relations between the sexes, but none could gainsay his historical accuracy. His novel The Wallace (1975) is admirably free of anything to do with Braveheart, and The Wisest Fool (1974) is a well-judged and sympathetic portrait of King James I of Great Britain. At the same time, he found the energy to complete the five volumes of The Fortified House in Scotland (1962-1971), which proved to be a worthy successor to his first work. Restless and energetic as he was in his literary output, Tranter was also a great enabler, who served Scottish PEN and the Society of Authors in Scotland as chairman. Above all he was a patriot. In the 1950s he was a member of the Scottish Convention movement, which campaigned for a Scottish parliament, and his joy when it finally came into being last year was tempered only by his friends' dismay that he was not invited to the opening ceremony. However, it was entirely fitting that one of his last awards, a silver quaich (small drinking cup) from his fellow authors, was presented to him by the first minister, Donald Dewar. He won other honours, including an OBE in 1983, but these he wore lightly. His passions were the rigours of researching the dark alleyways of his nation's history and the joy of writing it up on a long walk. In 1933 he married May Grieve, who predeceased him, as did his son Philip, but his last years were made happier by the loving companionship of Joan Earle. He is survived by a daughter.

      "body": "<p>Reading the lurid headlines portraying run-down estates in the north - never the south - as beyond redemption, it is easy to construct an image of provincial cities reaching the point of no return. Photographs of boarded-up, or derelict and vandalised houses reinforce the stereotype of grim northern conurbations offering little hope and no work. They have become the pictorial cliches of our time.</p> <p>Solving deep-seated decline and depopulation - what the Americans label \"abandonment\" - has become an academic industry in its own right. No matter that these so-called \"sink\" estates represent a tiny proportion of the housing stock in a city like Newcastle upon Tyne, which seems to be first port of call for any television crew in search of the ultimate urban horror story.</p> <p>Powerful images of new houses facing demolition because - unsurprisingly - no one wants to live in an estate branded lawless and run-down, present a terribly partial picture of our (still) great northern cities.</p> <p>Who would think that close to these problem areas (from Newcastle, to Leeds and Liverpool) enterprising tenants' groups are turning some estates around; that right in the heart of these cities, people are returning to live in their thousands. Riversides are transforming, new enterprises are sprouting, new cultural industries are born. Tyneside's emerging south bank complex opposite Newcastle - art galleries, concert hall, entertainment and all - will soon be a model for Britain.</p> <p>Northern cities, the very ones recently highlighted in yet another report on \"sink\" estates, certainly disturb as well as enrich. Once the great centres of manufacturing and commerce, they have received a particularly bad deal over the past 20 years - undermined first by massive de-industrialisation, then by new manufacturers moving to pleasant, greenfield sites (with hefty government subsidies) and finally by Mrs Thatcher's \"great car economy\" which spawned out-of-town US-style shopping malls.</p> <p>Looking at the frightening scale of industrial decline since the early 80s, and the consequent impact on those run-down estates where - unsurprisingly - there is little or no demand for housing, it is remarkable that northern cities have survived at all, let alone reinvented themselves and begun the slow trek to recovery with a new breed of entrepreneurs (some of whom have put a Newcastle software company in the FTSE 100).</p> <p>A report last year by Ivan Turok, professor of urban economic development at Glasgow university found that from 1981 to 1996 alone, cities lost 500,000 jobs - mainly for male, manual workers - while the rest of the country gained more than three times as many as companies were encouraged to expand in rural Britain.</p> <p>Thankfully, there is an urban upside; at the same time, professional and managerial jobs, in cities such as Leeds and Manchester, have grown against the trend - although they are generally unsuitable for people from a manual culture. That's the bad news. It also represents the challenge, namely curbing the drift of people and jobs to suburbia and beyond.</p> <p>Recognising that cities should once again be the engines of growth in regional economies, England's seven core centres (Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield) have formed a lobbying group to fight back. Why, they ask, do English cities - save London, naturally - lack the clout of Continental counterparts such as Lyon, Barcelona, Munich or Milan? Why does the government concentrate so much of its research funding at Oxford, Cambridge, and in London (UCL and Imperial College) - an essential step in encouraging new-tec companies - when great regional universities in northern and midlands cities are starved of such cash?</p> <p>In many ways this government, so committed to serving the interests of corporate Britain headquartered largely in London, appears as centralist as the last. But there is hope. John Prescott's department of the environment, transport and the regions is currently pulling together an urban white paper which - hopefully - will promote a key theme from a report last year by an urban task force, chaired by the architect Lord Rogers. That involves a string of tax incentives, perhaps low tax zones in cities, to encourage the entrepreneurial - with tax penalties to discourage greenfield development.</p> <p>In the US, where the tax system has long been used to \"incentivise\", the great suburban drift is being challenged. Roberta Brandes Gratz, the New York-based writer and urban champion, whose latest book chronicles the fall and rise of great cities (Cities Back From the Edge: New Life for Downtown), says America has finally woken up to the \"dysfunctional nature of what we have been doing since the last war\".</p> <p>Inner cities, in short, are being reinvented and re-populated because people are choosing to live close to the amenities they cherish, without the need to use a car. New businesses are thriving. Even retailers, once locked into an out-of-town shopping culture, are returning to revitalised centres, while older malls are now closing down.</p> <p>British cities, she says, have not followed the US by demolishing much of their central areas, pushing public transport aside in the process. And that is good news.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Reading the lurid headlines portraying run-down estates in the north - never the south - as beyond redemption, it is easy to construct an image of provincial cities reaching the point of no return. Photographs of boarded-up, or derelict and vandalised houses reinforce the stereotype of grim northern conurbations offering little hope and no work. They have become the pictorial cliches of our time. Solving deep-seated decline and depopulation - what the Americans label \"abandonment\" - has become an academic industry in its own right. No matter that these so-called \"sink\" estates represent a tiny proportion of the housing stock in a city like Newcastle upon Tyne, which seems to be first port of call for any television crew in search of the ultimate urban horror story. Powerful images of new houses facing demolition because - unsurprisingly - no one wants to live in an estate branded lawless and run-down, present a terribly partial picture of our (still) great northern cities. Who would think that close to these problem areas (from Newcastle, to Leeds and Liverpool) enterprising tenants' groups are turning some estates around; that right in the heart of these cities, people are returning to live in their thousands. Riversides are transforming, new enterprises are sprouting, new cultural industries are born. Tyneside's emerging south bank complex opposite Newcastle - art galleries, concert hall, entertainment and all - will soon be a model for Britain. Northern cities, the very ones recently highlighted in yet another report on \"sink\" estates, certainly disturb as well as enrich. Once the great centres of manufacturing and commerce, they have received a particularly bad deal over the past 20 years - undermined first by massive de-industrialisation, then by new manufacturers moving to pleasant, greenfield sites (with hefty government subsidies) and finally by Mrs Thatcher's \"great car economy\" which spawned out-of-town US-style shopping malls. Looking at the frightening scale of industrial decline since the early 80s, and the consequent impact on those run-down estates where - unsurprisingly - there is little or no demand for housing, it is remarkable that northern cities have survived at all, let alone reinvented themselves and begun the slow trek to recovery with a new breed of entrepreneurs (some of whom have put a Newcastle software company in the FTSE 100). A report last year by Ivan Turok, professor of urban economic development at Glasgow university found that from 1981 to 1996 alone, cities lost 500,000 jobs - mainly for male, manual workers - while the rest of the country gained more than three times as many as companies were encouraged to expand in rural Britain. Thankfully, there is an urban upside; at the same time, professional and managerial jobs, in cities such as Leeds and Manchester, have grown against the trend - although they are generally unsuitable for people from a manual culture. That's the bad news. It also represents the challenge, namely curbing the drift of people and jobs to suburbia and beyond. Recognising that cities should once again be the engines of growth in regional economies, England's seven core centres (Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Sheffield) have formed a lobbying group to fight back. Why, they ask, do English cities - save London, naturally - lack the clout of Continental counterparts such as Lyon, Barcelona, Munich or Milan? Why does the government concentrate so much of its research funding at Oxford, Cambridge, and in London (UCL and Imperial College) - an essential step in encouraging new-tec companies - when great regional universities in northern and midlands cities are starved of such cash? In many ways this government, so committed to serving the interests of corporate Britain headquartered largely in London, appears as centralist as the last. But there is hope. John Prescott's department of the environment, transport and the regions is currently pulling together an urban white paper which - hopefully - will promote a key theme from a report last year by an urban task force, chaired by the architect Lord Rogers. That involves a string of tax incentives, perhaps low tax zones in cities, to encourage the entrepreneurial - with tax penalties to discourage greenfield development. In the US, where the tax system has long been used to \"incentivise\", the great suburban drift is being challenged. Roberta Brandes Gratz, the New York-based writer and urban champion, whose latest book chronicles the fall and rise of great cities (Cities Back From the Edge: New Life for Downtown), says America has finally woken up to the \"dysfunctional nature of what we have been doing since the last war\". Inner cities, in short, are being reinvented and re-populated because people are choosing to live close to the amenities they cherish, without the need to use a car. New businesses are thriving. Even retailers, once locked into an out-of-town shopping culture, are returning to revitalised centres, while older malls are now closing down. British cities, she says, have not followed the US by demolishing much of their central areas, pushing public transport aside in the process. And that is good news.",

But the Indian government warned him last night that his organisation needed a thorough overhaul before it restarted the talks. India's commerce and industry minister, Murasoli Maran, said the WTO needed to be reformed, and that it was time it took note of the \"fears, anxiety and insecurity\" of the developing nations. \"The WTO cannot be allowed to become another world government,\" said Mr Maran. \"We cannot allow ourselves to be threatened by sanctions and forced to reduce our competitive advantage.\" American proposals to impose sanctions on goods from developing countries with poor labour standards are partly blamed for the collapse of last December's talks. Mr Moore wants a deal that will offer technical assistance in negotiating and implementing trade pacts and improve market access for the poorest countries. But many developing nations are worried that until the Geneva-based body overhauls the decision-making processes which left them locked out of important meetings during the Seattle summit, any new negotiating round would be biased against them. Britain is backing a programme of fast-track reform over the next year for the troubled organisation. The trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, who was also at the meeting in New Delhi, believes no progress will be made on the talks until after the US presidential elections in November. But sources in Geneva said yesterday that a clear reform programme backed by a majority of the WTO's 134 members has yet to emerge. Trade diplomats have only just returned to the Swiss capital after the holiday break, and Mr Moore has been in his home country, New Zealand.

      "bodyText": "Open, the interactive service which launched on SkyDigital at the end of last year, silenced its critics yesterday with the disclosure that home shopping sales reached \u00a31m a week in the run-up to Christmas. The fledgling service, owned by BSkyB, British Telecommunications, banking group HSBC and Matsushita, has processed 128,000 orders since the launch on October 12, the company said. For e-tailers such as Toyzone, revenues via the service accounted for up to 40% of pre-Christmas sales. \"Interactive TV has already made an impact on millions of people,\" said Open chief executive James Ackerman. \"E-commerce is about more than just 'hit rates' and 'click throughs' - it is about real sales. Open has proven in a very short period of time that it is capable of generating real sales.\" The figures overshadowed an announcement from cable rival Telewest, which signed up another 15 partners for the spring launch of its interactive service. The content providers joining the line-up included Argos, Bloomberg TV, Eagle Star, Emap Online, Woolworths and British Airways. The service is part of Telewest's 150-channel Active Digital offering which was launched in three regions during October. The 15 companies join another 14 already committed to the Telewest service, including Abbey National and online travel firm Lastminute.com. Around 95% of Telewest households will have access to digital by the end of 2000. Participants in the Open service were enthusiastic about the launch. Mobile telephone retailer Carphone Warehouse said sales were already ahead of one of its flagship stores on London's Oxford Street. Ticket seller First Call said it had racked up sales of \u00a3300,000 through the service. \"Considering we're talking about something which launched only 10 weeks ago, these are pretty exciting numbers,\" said Paul Richards, media analyst at West LB Panmure. Many of the content providers, including Woolworths and Gameplay.com, have signed up with more than one service. If the figures continue to grow, interactive TV could have a far greater impact in the short to medium term than conventional internet access. \"I can point to certain days during the lead-in to Christmas where Open was performing as well as the internet,\" said Jo Hall, the managing director of Toyzone. Open also claimed that 350,000 people have registered for email and 40,000 now use TV banking with HSBC. NTL has yet to give a launch date for its digital service while Cable &amp; Wireless Communications - its putative merger partner - already has 50,000 digital subscribers.",

The company had to disable its incoming email service temporarily at the weekend after hackers were suspected of infiltrating its systems. Virgin Net said it informed around 155,000 of its 620,000 users that the \"integrity\" of accounts could be at risk unless they changed passwords following the breach, which occurred last Thursday.

Alex Heath, the managing director of Virgin Net, said there was no evidence that accounts had been abused. \"Our customers' email privacy has always been and will continue to be a top priority for Virgin Net, and as such we have acted quickly and decisively to ensure the integrity of the service.\" Virgin's scare, which is likely to fuel fears about security and privacy on the net, paled against the problems encountered by an American online music retailer at the weekend. CD Universe was contacted by a hacker who claimed he would publish customers' credit card details on the web unless he was sent $100,000. The blackmailer, who said he was 19 and from Russia, released some details when CD Universe refused to pay up. He set up a website allowing surfers to obtain credit card numbers, with names and addresses, by clicking a mouse. The site was shut down yesterday following the intervention of the FBI. \"The internet creates a whole new class of criminals,\" said Elias Levy, of computer security firm SecurityFocus.com. \"On the net you can have criminals coming from countries where we have no extradition treaties.

      "bodyText": "The attorney general yesterday moved to allay fears that an immunity he had granted covering documents presented to the Paddington rail crash inquiry would wreck hopes of a criminal prosecution. Lord Williams issued a clarification which British transport police hailed as a \"significant change\" and which would increase the chances of prosecution if evidence of criminal wrongdoing emerged. The attorney general's clarification follows yesterday's report in the Guardian of detectives' fears that there was virtually no chance of a prosecution because the immunity undertaking was so wide. Officers feared that documents on which a prosecution for corporate manslaughter would have to be based would be barred from use. The attorney general said only the individual copy of a document would be barred from use in any criminal case, not the document itself. A police source said the attorney general's rushed clarification \"made a nonsense\" of the original announcement of the scope of the immunity made by Lord Cullen, who chairs the inquiry which formally opened last month. In a statement, Lord Williams said: \"It has been suggested that there is some ambiguity in the expression 'documents produced to the inquiry will not be used in any prosecution'. \"It has been argued that, on one construction, these words have the effect that service of a document on the inquiry protects the provider from the use of that document or any copy of it in any prosecution, even if it could be obtained (or already has been obtained) by the police or other investigators under their own powers. \"It is not the intention that the undertaking has this wide effect. The undertaking protects from use in any prosecution the actual documents produced to the inquiry. It does not extend to any other manifestation of the documents, whether the originals (if those are retained) or any copies which the police or other investigators are able to obtain.\" The crash between a Great Western train and a Thames turbo last October left 31 dead and 250 injured. As well as the two train companies, Railtrack and the health and safety executive are under criminal investigation. Those leading the 40-strong team of officers now believe they could use any documents if they were obtained before being submitted to the inquiry, due to get underway in late spring. Superintendent Tony Thompson of British transport police said the attorney general's statement removed a major obstacle to a trial: \"Our initial interpretation is that it's quite a significant change from what was said in December by Lord Cullen. \"They are now talking about manifestations, which one assumes means a copy. It is a complete change around from what they said originally. \"I think providing we have obtained it in advance, we could still use any documents.\" Oral evidence before the inquiry will still be covered by immunity, which is meant to encourage people to testify without fear of self-incrimination. Louise Christian, a solicitor for eight of the bereaved families, said she wanted the immunity covering written evidence and documents lifted completely because there was no need for it. The attorney general said the undertakings to witnesses would hasten the start of the inquiry: \"It was certain that without such an undertaking being given, potential witnesses would be inhibited from providing Lord Cullen with full assistance. The public interest clearly favours Lord Cullen undertaking his inquiry as soon, and as quickly, as possible so that lessons can be learnt.\" After the 1997 Southall rail crash, a public inquiry into the disaster was delayed for two years after a corporate mans-laughter trial was launched, which eventually failed. David Miles, a survivor of the Paddington rail crash, said: \"My major concern is that an inquiry is gone into as quickly as possible to try to identify what the causes were of the accident. \"But I appreciate that I am somebody who is possibly slightly luckier than an awful lot of other people who have a lot more serious injuries and who therefore may have a much greater desire to see that people are held to account.\" Police have still not decided if there is a criminal case for any company or individual to answer. They hope to conclude their investigation by the end of March.",

Almost all tycoons have a completely different lifestyle to that of the average Labour voter. The world of Robert Maxwell and Geoffrey Robinson is a million miles away from that inhabited by the enormous majority of the citizens of Dunfermline East.

The problem was not in the intent, but in the hobnobbing.</p> <p>Then there was the sad case of MacDonald's closest ally, the former trade union leader Jimmy Thomas. He hobnobbed with Alfred Cosher Bates, a heavy drinker, hard gambler and millionaire. Bates paid Thomas an enormous advance for a book he hadn't written. Before the budget of 1936, Leslie Thomas, Jimmy's son, took out two huge policies insuring Bates against a rise in income tax. Hey presto! Income tax went up and the insurance policies paid up.</p> <p>Thomas and Bates had been almost inseparable during the Easter weekend before the budget, and once again people jumped to the conclusion that a crucial budget secret had been leaked. Thomas denied it of course, but a tribunal of inquiry found against him and he was obliged to resign.</p> <p>The hobnobbing habit persisted after the war. In the summer of 1968, Barbara Castle, secretary of state for transport in the Labour government, fell in with the millionaire restaurateur Charles Forte in the islands off Italy, and they all engaged in what she described as \"jaunts\".</p> <p>The following year, 1969, she was first secretary in charge of prices and incomes. In the late spring, she took advantage of Forte's yacht, which he'd lent her. With her and her husband was another secretary of state, Dick Crossman, and his wife. \"It really does make life easier,\" wrote Barbara Castle in her diary, \"to have four crew looking after six people!

And as for \"Harold\" - Harold Wilson, Labour's prime minister - no wonder he saw no harm in the Castle/Crossman Forte holiday. He spent much of his life in the company of tycoons, who never did him any good, usually the opposite.</p> <p>At any rate, no one could argue that in the business of hobnobbing with tycoons, New Labour has shifted a millimetre away from the habits of Old.</p>",

One thing the British experience shows, thanks to the incidence of BSE here, is how vital is a reliable national apparatus of inspection, monitoring and research, and how hard it is - witness the snail's pace at which our food standards agency is being prised from the bureaucratic clutches of the ministry of agriculture - to tilt the nutritional balance away from the interests of food producers.",

What the school needed was good leadership. The teachers were all signed up to improvement. If we were still failing then, the support team would not have worked.\" </p> <p>With A-Cs on an upward trend, Barker is having no truck with performance-related pay or punitive target-setting - the school has set its own realistic goals for improvement. \"Performance-related pay is the one thing that any group of teachers will bitterly oppose.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Macbeth has always been a great crowd-pleaser, and yet it has a reputation for bad luck and its name must never be pronounced inside a theatre.</p> <p>Ironically, one theory for all this suggests the reason lies in the play's historic popularity with audiences. This was the show that theatre companies might have in their repertoire in case of emergency: if interest in Hamlet was flagging, there was always Macbeth to dust off as a good box office draw. </p> <p>Despite its short length, Macbeth contains a substantial amount of on-stage violence. If under-rehearsed, it is not hard to imagine that accidents would occur, and so the play's reputation for attracting the unhealthy attentions of evil forces from some dark beyond grew. </p> <p>No one is quite sure when Macbeth was first performed. There is evidence that it was first performed on stage in 1611, but legend has it that it was acted for King James I at Hampton Court at least five years earlier. </p> <p>There was plenty in the play to keep the king absorbed. James was fascinated by witchcraft. He spent much of his reign convinced that he was the target of a Satanic conspiracy and removed his greatest political rival in Scotland, the Earl of Bothwell, by accusing him of plotting his downfall with some North Berwick witches. James even attended the torture and prosecution of the arrested coven members. In 1597, he published the book Demonology, which summed up his thinking on the subject. </p> <p>Macbeth is about many things. Read as a tragedy, it is an examination of a man who suffers from \"vaulting ambition\", anticipates the dangers and misery that may flow from his ruthless pursuit of power and yet pursues it all the same. </p> <p>His flaw is to believe that he is beyond the reach of fate, while his defiance in the face of disaster restores his heroic status. Like the previous Thane of Cawdor, \"Nothing in his life becomes him like the leaving of it.\" </p> <p>Other critics see the play as a study in politics. Strip away the mystifying magic and ghosts, and you are left with a stark object lesson in the practicalities of power. </p> <p>This \"reading against the grain\" places emphasis on the weakness of King Duncan, beset by enemies at the start of the play and relying on brutal warlords such as Macbeth to preserve him on the throne. Once Macbeth takes the crown, we witness the corrupting influence of absolute power and the fears that attend those who wield it. </p> <p>In an extraordinary moment in the banquet scene, the realities of Macbeth's rule are laid bare. He greets his guests: \"Be large in mirth, anon we'll drink a measure/ The table round.\" Immediately, he turns to a murderer: \"There's blood upon thy face.\" In two juxtaposed lines the public relations of power give way to the ruthlessness that underpins tyranny. </p> <p>Your unavoidable fate is that Macbeth is on the syllabus at key stage 3. There is nothing like thinking of a play as a SATs set text for draining it of its mystery. But look beyond this if you can. The scenes you will be studying in depth spotlight the process a person must go through to commit premeditated murder (Act 1 Scenes 6 and 7) and the macabre horrors of witchcraft and prediction that drive him to greater excesses (Act 4 Scene1). </p> <p>It is a fascinating journey and it may colour your judgment of politicians forever. </p> <p><strong> Macbeth the movie</strong></p> <p>There are a number of film versions of Macbeth that will help give you a sense of the play in performance.</p> <p><strong> Orson Welles' 1948 Macbeth:</strong> high on shadow and spoken in strange Scots accents, the film was made in 21 days on sets made from papier mach\u00e9. </p> <p><strong> Joe Macbeth (1955):</strong> a British-made gangster version that required actors such as Sid James (of Carry On fame) to speak in an American accent. \"Intriguing\", to damn it with faint praise. </p> <p><strong> Akira Kurosawa's Throne of Blood:</strong> don't let the fact that it is black and white and in Japanese put you off. It is visually stunning. The final sequence in which wave upon wave of arrows pepper the king is extraordinary. </p> <p><strong> Roman Polanski's Macbeth (1972):</strong> gory and brutal.

      "bodyText": "Macbeth has always been a great crowd-pleaser, and yet it has a reputation for bad luck and its name must never be pronounced inside a theatre. Ironically, one theory for all this suggests the reason lies in the play's historic popularity with audiences. This was the show that theatre companies might have in their repertoire in case of emergency: if interest in Hamlet was flagging, there was always Macbeth to dust off as a good box office draw. Despite its short length, Macbeth contains a substantial amount of on-stage violence. If under-rehearsed, it is not hard to imagine that accidents would occur, and so the play's reputation for attracting the unhealthy attentions of evil forces from some dark beyond grew. No one is quite sure when Macbeth was first performed. There is evidence that it was first performed on stage in 1611, but legend has it that it was acted for King James I at Hampton Court at least five years earlier. There was plenty in the play to keep the king absorbed. James was fascinated by witchcraft. He spent much of his reign convinced that he was the target of a Satanic conspiracy and removed his greatest political rival in Scotland, the Earl of Bothwell, by accusing him of plotting his downfall with some North Berwick witches. James even attended the torture and prosecution of the arrested coven members. In 1597, he published the book Demonology, which summed up his thinking on the subject. Macbeth is about many things. Read as a tragedy, it is an examination of a man who suffers from \"vaulting ambition\", anticipates the dangers and misery that may flow from his ruthless pursuit of power and yet pursues it all the same. His flaw is to believe that he is beyond the reach of fate, while his defiance in the face of disaster restores his heroic status. Like the previous Thane of Cawdor, \"Nothing in his life becomes him like the leaving of it.\" Other critics see the play as a study in politics. Strip away the mystifying magic and ghosts, and you are left with a stark object lesson in the practicalities of power. This \"reading against the grain\" places emphasis on the weakness of King Duncan, beset by enemies at the start of the play and relying on brutal warlords such as Macbeth to preserve him on the throne. Once Macbeth takes the crown, we witness the corrupting influence of absolute power and the fears that attend those who wield it. In an extraordinary moment in the banquet scene, the realities of Macbeth's rule are laid bare. He greets his guests: \"Be large in mirth, anon we'll drink a measure/ The table round.\" Immediately, he turns to a murderer: \"There's blood upon thy face.\" In two juxtaposed lines the public relations of power give way to the ruthlessness that underpins tyranny. Your unavoidable fate is that Macbeth is on the syllabus at key stage 3. There is nothing like thinking of a play as a SATs set text for draining it of its mystery. But look beyond this if you can. The scenes you will be studying in depth spotlight the process a person must go through to commit premeditated murder (Act 1 Scenes 6 and 7) and the macabre horrors of witchcraft and prediction that drive him to greater excesses (Act 4 Scene1). It is a fascinating journey and it may colour your judgment of politicians forever. Macbeth the movie There are a number of film versions of Macbeth that will help give you a sense of the play in performance. Orson Welles' 1948 Macbeth: high on shadow and spoken in strange Scots accents, the film was made in 21 days on sets made from papier mach\u00e9. Joe Macbeth (1955): a British-made gangster version that required actors such as Sid James (of Carry On fame) to speak in an American accent. \"Intriguing\", to damn it with faint praise. Akira Kurosawa's Throne of Blood: don't let the fact that it is black and white and in Japanese put you off. It is visually stunning. The final sequence in which wave upon wave of arrows pepper the king is extraordinary. Roman Polanski's Macbeth (1972): gory and brutal. Apart from a number of decapitations and hangings, it also features an early performance of Keith Chegwin as Banquo's son Fleance. Surely, on the strength of that alone the British Board Of Film Classification should consider revising the certificate down to PG? \u0095 Jerome Monahan is currently working on an education pack for Film Education and the British Film Institute on film versions of Macbeth.",

Teaching assessments have fast developed into one of the least popular aspects of academic life, consuming time and resources for little financial reward. \"We are fully supportive of independent assessment of teaching quality, but one which is much less intrusive to institutions than current arrangements. It is not clear whether the new proposals will achieve the objective,\" said Dr Geoffrey Copland, vice-chancellor of Westminster University, and the current convener of the Coalition of Modern Universities, which brings together the heads of the former polytechnics. \"We want to see these schemes simplified, made more straightforward and a lighter touch applied,\" said Sir Alec Broers, vice-chancellor of Cambridge University. The agency's chief executive, John Randall, denied the accusations, arguing that the new inspection system would do away with much of the bureacracy associated with current department assessments. \"One of the things institutions see as the icon that represent heavy touch is what they call the base room, where they assemble all the documentation that the reviewers could conceivably look at,\" he said. \"That will be a thing of the past. We are trying to work with institutions' own systems; that is what is going to give the major reduction in burden.\" \u0095 Lee Elliot Major is deputy editor of Research Fortnight.",

Ushaw College, a seminary five miles outside Durham, has seen its numbers double this year. </p> <p>But before we start to see signs of a religious resurgence at the dawn of a new millennium, let's be clear about the figures. For the whole country we're talking of no more than 280 new trainees, far too few to stem the critical shortfall in priests. At Ushaw we're talking of 13 new entrants, as opposed to six the year before. They are still rattling around a seminary built for 400. </p> <p>What can be the role of a celibate male priesthood in an age which has seen the triumph of secularism in Western democracies and left the Church in crisis, ripped apart by sexual scandal among its ordained, and with increasing non-attendance by its laity? With a marked lack of fresh papal guidance on the subject for nearly a decade, this is the question that those responsible for the training of priests have to ask themselves over and over again. </p> <p>Father Jim O'Keefe, the president of Ushaw, feels constantly challenged on this subject, and as the recipient of many personal letters from priests over the years, is well aware of the difficulties they face. The annual gathering of the St Cuthbert's Society, an old boys' reunion, is open to all former seminarians, even those lost from the fold. On the last occasion, O'Keefe spent the last night in the bar with three former students - all were ordained as priests but left to marry. The reunion, he believes, must be about openness and reconciliation if it is to have any purpose. </p> <p>For Ushaw, like most seminaries, is in the throes of transformation. Tucked away on a wooded estate overlooking County Durham, it is a vast, rambling stone building that opens out endlessly into great halls, refectories, Pugin chapels, long corridors and inner courtyards, the nearest thing to Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast. Awesome in its scale, it was built in 1808 as a statement of the Church's mission, an act of confidence and aspiration decades before full Catholic Emancipation. </p> <p>In the late 1950s, when Jim O'Keefe arrived as a boy, there were 400 seminarians from as young as 11. Now there are 30, none under 21, many in their late 20s and 30s and some approaching 50. This September may have seen modest increases, but last year saw the lowest intake of seminarians in England and Wales for nearly 150 years. </p> <p>The late Cardinal Basil Hume has been praised for helping to accommodate Catholicism within the British establishment as well as speaking out for the socially excluded and sexually marginalised, but the problem of attracting ordinands remains intractable. </p> <p>During Hume's term of office, numbers coming forward for the priesthood continued to fall. Sexual scandal has rocked Catholicism in Britain and Ireland and men committed to celibacy are seen as odd, if not suspect. The priest is no longer on a pedestal, and can be despised. The active Catholic laity seeks empowerment and the priestly role in contemporary society is not at all clear. It can be a lonely, embattled existence. </p> <p>Needless to say the education of priests has had to change, and is constantly being reassessed to cope with demands. Father Jim Overton, a former chaplain of London University, was appointed by Basil Hume to Allen Hall, a seminary in Westminster, a year before the Cardinal's death. He does not underestimate the challenge: \"It's a big task and there are very few answers. What the heck the priesthood will be like in five years' time, never mind ten, I just don't know.\" </p> <p>Things have certainly changed dramatically since those first decades at Ushaw, when the formation was largely academic and the staple teaching method was dictation in Latin. At the end of his course each student had his own library of handwritten treatises to take home. Even when O'Keefe came as a student in the 1950s, Latin was compulsory up to A-level and the life of the student academic enclosed. At their reunion former students joked about the ruses they would devise to escape the college confines. One described how, having fallen in love with the dentist's receptionist in Durham, he persuaded her to give him a pile of blank appointment cards, which he would fill in and present to the college rector at credible intervals. </p> <p>These days students are required to go out into the world. During their six-year formation they are sent out on extended placements into parishes or as hospital, school or university chaplains. A core academic curriculum remains - biblical studies, systemic theology, patristics, philosophy and religion, the study of New Testament Greek and elementary Hebrew. But the emphasis is just as much on spiritual and human development.</p> <p>Students are just as likely to take courses on personal growth and pastoral care in which they focus on self-awareness and the development issues affecting childhood through to old age and on pastoral issues such as stress and depression. They are as likely to take a course in death and dying or on sexuality, gender and Christian ministry in which they will explore issues such as celibacy, singleness, homosexuality and intimacy. </p> <p>O'Keefe, the son of a good Catholic mining family, came to Ushaw at 11 to join the junior seminary (now closed). He was ordained in 1972 and went to work in the north-east, where he also become religious programmes producer for local radio. He came back to Ushaw in 1977 to run its pastoral theology and communications department. Today he is rector to a body of students from very different backgrounds from his own, many of whom have worked and owned property, or gone through a period of being alienated from the Church. Current seminarians include a former driving instructor, a prison visitor and an engineer, a computer programmer, a young man with a law degree, a former member of the merchant navy, a teacher, a gardener and a supermarket worker. </p> <p>Ushaw was once a self-contained community with a home farm, kitchen garden, bakery, tailor and cobblers; it has had to change. O'Keefe has been a prime mover in opening it up to women as well as lay men studying for a degree in theology and ministry, which is validated by and shared with Durham University. Having women living at Ushaw and sharing seminars is seen as an important part of the seminarians' learning process. In addition, 16,000 visitors passed through the college's conference centre last year. CAFOD now has its regional headquarters at Ushaw, which also houses the Marian Studies Centre. </p> <p>Ushaw offers seminarians time to study, contemplate and pray, but O'Keefe also sees outside influences moving into the place as crucial to their development. He is only too aware of the hardships they must be prepared to face. In the mid-1990s, he was a key member of the working party to the Catholic Bishops Conference of England and Wales on cases where the sexual abuse of children involved priests. He also receives letters from priests, particularly on the challenge of celibacy. One priest of 29 years wrote that celibacy had been a \"crucifying experience\" and \"the greatest hindrance to my ministry... Please tell your students of the experiences of many, many others for whom it has been living hell.\" </p> <p>O'Keefe takes this type of plea seriously. Human development and self-awareness have moved to centre-stage of the curriculum. \"Personal maturity is fundamental to a priest. In the past, training for priesthood was about learning to keep the rules. Now it's about being mature, about being compassionate and having the capacity for friendship and intimacy as well as leadership.\" </p> <p>He believes that celibacy should be a choice, rather than compulsory, but he is very sure about the important role a celibate priest can play in contemporary society. Not only should the priest of the future be there to contemplate and reflect on God and society in a \"very busy, relationship-oriented world\", but the celibate bears witness to the fact that being a normal being \"does not have to be justified by sexual activity. They can witness to the loneliness that even the sexually active experience, that is there in the lives of everybody\". </p> <p>However, both he and Jim Overton are aware of the responsibility facing them as educators. \"Above all,\" says Overton, \"we do not want a man not to know what he is entering into.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>\"Life is too short to stuff a mushroom,\" declared Shirley Conran in her epigraph to Superwoman. Alas, her paean to slothfulness appears to have been consigned to pop culture's great dustbin, alongside cherry-flavoured lip gloss and Charlie perfume.</p> <p>Now we have a far more sensible domestic superheroine to inspire us. She is rich, she has sold more than 10 million books and she loves football, just like all good post-feminists are supposed to. Let's hear it, then, for Delia Smith, the woman who has got us all scuttling back to the scullery to agonise over whether our eggs are fresh enough to whip up a hollandaise sauce. Even before the first part of her new series was broadcast last night, she had sold a million copies of the accompanying book, a sequel to her back-to-basics manifesto, How To Cook.</p> <p>The BBC helpfully commissioned a survey to launch the series. This revealed that 16% of men never cook, compared with only 3% of women. (Is this news?) The survey also uncovered the fact that 85% of British cupboards contain a bottle of tomato ketchup.</p> <p>Perhaps a more valuable deployment of licence payers' money would have been to discover another statistic entirely: how many women in Britain buy cookery books from which they will never create a single meal? And how many of them will feel like dismal failures as a consequence?</p> <p>Despite her phenomenal success, Delia Smith and her sisters in crime (the River Cafe babes, Sophie Grigson) occupy a peculiarly anachronistic position in our lives. Everything about Delia's new book, for example, harks back to the fantasy housewife of the 50s. Her jolly, matronly tone is accessorised with the type of ingredients that put me in mind of Enid Blyton's Mallory Towers books - greengages, gooseberry fool, stewed rhubarb, herring, kippers and prunes. Added to that is her coy line in innuendo, including a Carry On-style anecdote about capers in her larder. There is a recipe for Eton Mess (mashed meringue and strawberries), but thankfully none for stuffed mushrooms.</p> <p>It is not just our culinary skills that are under scrutiny now, either: this time around, Smith wants to control how we organise our store cupboards and what brands of pots and pans we buy. For a woman of a certain age and temperament, these will be issues to which she has never previously devoted a single moment of her attention. Until now. Now she will, if she is like me, be having dark nights of the soul worrying about the fact that Lakeland Plastics don't have a branch in London.</p> <p>Recipes themselves have a sneaky habit of instilling panic in the calmest of souls. The current emphasis on how very easy it is to jug a hare (River Cafe) or soak and boil a pot of cannellini beans (Nigella Lawson) serves only to make the inept feel inadequate and, by proxy, unfeminine. Delia is the worst because you can hear her cooing in your ear as you try to boil an egg without cracking the shell. \"This is easy, so easy.\" So how does that make us feel when we get it wrong?</p> <p>It remains a mystery why we feel we have to live up to her and dozens of other culinary dominatrixes, though. I never feel the slightest urge to compete with the boys - Ainsley, Marco and Gary, to name but three - but then it is a curious thing that men in this business are always chefs but women rarely have that distinction bestowed upon them. Instead they are referred to as cooks, with the implied aura of domestic drudgery.</p> <p>Sadly, the vogue for drudgery looks like it is here to stay - books, TV programmes, videos and even CD-roms remain huge sellers. A knock-on effect is the boom in super-complicated kitchen equipment. Now it is not enough merely to cook like a Michelin-starred chef, we must have a gleaming chrome kitchen to match, complete with Smeg six-burner oven that has enough fire-power to send us to the moon if the souffl\u00e9 doesn't rise.</p> <p>American writer Laura Shapiro believes this mania about cooking is part of a sinister return to domestic enslavement. In her book, Perfection Salad: Women And Cooking, she reminds us of how the 50s was in fact a golden age when home freezing and processed foods were designed to give us all more free time to devote to futuristic values such as careers and relationships.</p> <p>\"Whether or not they like to cook, most women liked feeling as though they were cooking,\" Shapiro says. \"And they worried about leaving out the most powerful ingredient in any dish, the ingredient one food writer described as 'a mother's love for her family'.\"</p> <p>Delia and co would be doing us a big favour if they went the whole hog and launched a range of Learn To Eat ready meals instead of giving us any more grief. Chocolate and prune brownie mix anyone?</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"Life is too short to stuff a mushroom,\" declared Shirley Conran in her epigraph to Superwoman. Alas, her paean to slothfulness appears to have been consigned to pop culture's great dustbin, alongside cherry-flavoured lip gloss and Charlie perfume. Now we have a far more sensible domestic superheroine to inspire us. She is rich, she has sold more than 10 million books and she loves football, just like all good post-feminists are supposed to. Let's hear it, then, for Delia Smith, the woman who has got us all scuttling back to the scullery to agonise over whether our eggs are fresh enough to whip up a hollandaise sauce. Even before the first part of her new series was broadcast last night, she had sold a million copies of the accompanying book, a sequel to her back-to-basics manifesto, How To Cook. The BBC helpfully commissioned a survey to launch the series. This revealed that 16% of men never cook, compared with only 3% of women. (Is this news?) The survey also uncovered the fact that 85% of British cupboards contain a bottle of tomato ketchup. Perhaps a more valuable deployment of licence payers' money would have been to discover another statistic entirely: how many women in Britain buy cookery books from which they will never create a single meal? And how many of them will feel like dismal failures as a consequence? Despite her phenomenal success, Delia Smith and her sisters in crime (the River Cafe babes, Sophie Grigson) occupy a peculiarly anachronistic position in our lives. Everything about Delia's new book, for example, harks back to the fantasy housewife of the 50s. Her jolly, matronly tone is accessorised with the type of ingredients that put me in mind of Enid Blyton's Mallory Towers books - greengages, gooseberry fool, stewed rhubarb, herring, kippers and prunes. Added to that is her coy line in innuendo, including a Carry On-style anecdote about capers in her larder. There is a recipe for Eton Mess (mashed meringue and strawberries), but thankfully none for stuffed mushrooms. It is not just our culinary skills that are under scrutiny now, either: this time around, Smith wants to control how we organise our store cupboards and what brands of pots and pans we buy. For a woman of a certain age and temperament, these will be issues to which she has never previously devoted a single moment of her attention. Until now. Now she will, if she is like me, be having dark nights of the soul worrying about the fact that Lakeland Plastics don't have a branch in London. Recipes themselves have a sneaky habit of instilling panic in the calmest of souls. The current emphasis on how very easy it is to jug a hare (River Cafe) or soak and boil a pot of cannellini beans (Nigella Lawson) serves only to make the inept feel inadequate and, by proxy, unfeminine. Delia is the worst because you can hear her cooing in your ear as you try to boil an egg without cracking the shell. \"This is easy, so easy.\" So how does that make us feel when we get it wrong? It remains a mystery why we feel we have to live up to her and dozens of other culinary dominatrixes, though. I never feel the slightest urge to compete with the boys - Ainsley, Marco and Gary, to name but three - but then it is a curious thing that men in this business are always chefs but women rarely have that distinction bestowed upon them. Instead they are referred to as cooks, with the implied aura of domestic drudgery. Sadly, the vogue for drudgery looks like it is here to stay - books, TV programmes, videos and even CD-roms remain huge sellers. A knock-on effect is the boom in super-complicated kitchen equipment. Now it is not enough merely to cook like a Michelin-starred chef, we must have a gleaming chrome kitchen to match, complete with Smeg six-burner oven that has enough fire-power to send us to the moon if the souffl\u00e9 doesn't rise. American writer Laura Shapiro believes this mania about cooking is part of a sinister return to domestic enslavement. In her book, Perfection Salad: Women And Cooking, she reminds us of how the 50s was in fact a golden age when home freezing and processed foods were designed to give us all more free time to devote to futuristic values such as careers and relationships. \"Whether or not they like to cook, most women liked feeling as though they were cooking,\" Shapiro says. \"And they worried about leaving out the most powerful ingredient in any dish, the ingredient one food writer described as 'a mother's love for her family'.\" Delia and co would be doing us a big favour if they went the whole hog and launched a range of Learn To Eat ready meals instead of giving us any more grief. Chocolate and prune brownie mix anyone?",

The 1,000 additions to the list of Britain's most influential people also includes street poet Benjamin Zephaniah and Annie Stewart, former editor of the black newspaper The Voice, Louise Frechette, deputy secretary general of the United Nations, and Nicholas Prettejohn, chief executive of Lloyd's of London. Teletubbies creator Anne Wood also makes it into the book, although her impact on the world cannot be doubted with millions of children around the world now saying \"eh-oh\". The entries under recreations make for some of the most interesting reading. Guardian writer and editor of the cricketing bible Wisden Matthew Engel enjoys \"whingeing\" as a hobby while the British ambassador to the UN, Stewart Eldon, puts down \"breaking computers\". Scotland football manager Craig Brown enjoys swimming in the sea, drinking and shopping while children's television presenter Floella Benjamin lists golf, cooking and running as her favourite pastimes. All names remain in the book until their deaths when they are transferred to Who Was Who. The new edition, which costs \u00a3115, is published on Wednesday. The publication is also available at libraries which have subscribed to the online reference service Know UK at www.knowuk.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "A man who stalked a TV newsreader for more than a year was yesterday jailed for two-and-a-half years and banned for life from contacting her. Jeremy Dyer, 30, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty at Maidstone crown court to harassing Sarah Lockett, 32, who works at the Kent studios of the ITV company Meridian. Passing sentence, Judge Susan Hamilton QC told Dyer he was \"an extremely weird young man\", adding that she did not believe him when he told the court he had sent at least 80 \"unpleasant and unwarranted\" letters because he thought Miss Lockett would be interested in the subject. \"Many contained ghoulish and frightening references. Shortly after you started writing, the letters became overtly sexual. At no time has there been a slightest hint of any care, concern or affection for the subject of this correspondence,\" the judge said. A restraining order was also imposed on Dyer, banning him for life from any contact with Ms Lockett and from coming within half a mile of her home or workplace. Judge Hamilton said Dyer had made three attempts to meet Ms Lockett at the television studios and tried to obtain her home address. \"Fortunately you were unable to do so,\" the judge said. \"We cannot tell what you may have done if you had found somewhere she did not have the protection of staff and of security guards.\" Dyer started the correspondence from December 1998. \"The ultimate in distasteful references were those relating to the death of Jill Dando and your glee in making comparisons between Miss Lockett and Jill Dando and their profession,\" Judge Hamilton said. She told Dyer he was \"an extremely weird young man\" although psychiatric reports found that he was not suffering from any mental illness. Judge Hamilton said women such as Ms Lockett must be protected from Dyer's \"ghoulish and threatening attention\". Dyer was earlier cleared of threatening to kill the presenter after the jury failed to reach a verdict during a five-day trial in December last year. Ms Lockett had told the court that letters from Dyer included those about \"different jackets I wore and which were more revealing than others\". After Ms Dando's death in April last year, Dyer wrote: \"I was hoping a celebrity would be murdered by a stalker and it makes it even better that she read the news.\"",

The census will also for the first time give people the chance to describe themselves as \"black British\" or \"Asian British\" when they are asked which ethnic group they belong to. The decision to ask about religion is principally designed to make the first accurate assessment of the size of Britain's largest minority ethnic community - the Muslims - for which estimates vary from 1m to 3m. Many government departments made a strong push to include questions about individual incomes in next year's census on the basis that it would be a far more accurate way of identifying areas of poverty and affluence in Britain than the current questions on occupation and housing conditions.

More than 90,000 people will be employed as temporary staff next year to canvass households to carry out the census which is compulsory. The official statisticians hope that the inclusion of the terms black British and British Asian for the first time will encourage a greater response rate among the minority ethnic communities. They also amount to official recognition that second and third generation children of West Indian and Asian backgrounds see themselves as British and black or British and Asian. The use of a question on religion will need legislation and the government is expected to announce that it will support a private member's bill which has been introduced into the Lords by a former speaker of the House of Commons, Lord Weatherill. The question will ask: \"What is your religion?\" and people will be asked of the following: none, Christian (including Church of England, Catholic, Protestant and all other Christian denominations), Buddist, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Jewish, any other religion. A question on religion has traditionally been included in the census in Northern Ireland where the information is used to monitor the effectiveness of policies aimed at improving equality. Next year in Northern Ireland the form will also ask those who answer \"no religion\" to record the religion in which they were brought up - if any.

      "bodyText": "The row over a Libyan attempt to breach the arms embargo took a new twist yesterday when it emerged that Britain had discovered an illegal consignment of Scud missile parts last May - two months before diplomatic links with the country were restored. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, brushed the disclosure aside at the time, seeing the restoration of relations with Libya as too important to be deflected by an illegal attempt to import missiles through Britain. Ripples from the Scud missile row continued to spread yesterday, throwing into doubt an invitation to the Libyan president, Colonel Muammar Gadafy, to visit Brussels from the European commission president, Romano Prodi. In a surprise development, Whitehall sources disclosed that customs and excise officers, along with intelligence staff, had discovered the Scud parts in May last year, not November, as reported at the weekend. Though they asked British Airways at Gatwick airport to stop the shipment, the crates were put on board the plane bound for Malta and Tripoli. Enraged officials urgently asked the Maltese authorities to seize the shipment. The crates were returned to Britain in July - the month diplomatic ties between Britain and Libya were officially restored. The shipment was impounded pending investigation and formally seized by customs in November. The foreign office confirmed yesterday that the crates had been impounded before ties were restored. While the revelation is potentially embarrassing for Mr Cook, the foreign office said the decision was justified, as it was important to have direct links with Libya to be able to discuss difficulties and have an influence. The foreign office saw the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as one of the key issues facing the world, but that problem was not confined to Libya. The 32 crates were labelled as spare parts for cars and were allegedly sent by a clothing company in Taiwan called Hontex. The firm denied any involvement with arms. \"We are an ordinary textile maker. We are not arms sellers,\" Wang Chuan-cheng, the president of Hontex's parent company, Nam Liong Industrial Corp, said yesterday. Washington is likely to use the disclosure of Libya's attempt to update its missile arsenal to try to persuade Europeans to join the US in developing a regional anti-missile system to match its national protective shield, which is expected to be given the go-ahead by President Bill Clinton this summer. Libya is one of the \"rogue\" states cited by the US as a reason for the US and its European allies developing anti-missile systems. The Europeans are strongly resisting the US plan, saying it would lead to a new arms race. Although it was initially feared that the Scud parts had been intended to extend the missile range from 200 to 600 miles, putting southern Italy within Libya's reach, the foreign office said the parts were only spares and would not affect the range. Col Gadafy's visit to Brussels now looks uncertain. While an EU spokesman said Mr Prodi still wanted to invite the colonel as part of a \"process of discussion\", Libya had set \"unacceptable\" conditions. EU officials said that although Libya had offered to join the 27-member Euro-Mediterranean forum, it insisted last week that Israel and the Palestinian Authority should be excluded from the group. \"If Libya maintains this position it will stay out of the process,\" said a spokesman for the external relations commissioner, Chris Patten. \"The discovery in London certainly shows how wise it is to maintain the arms embargo against Libya.\" Mr Patten, along with the EU's new foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, was said to have been outraged by Mr Prodi's Christmas invitation to the Libyan leader. To join the Euro-Mediterranean forum countries must pledge themselves to free trade, the promotion of human rights and the peaceful settlement of disputes. The EU has been working to improve relations with Libya since Col Gadafy allowed the handing over for trial in the Netherlands of two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988, when 270 people died. Last September the EU lifted most remaining sanctions imposed on Libya after the Lockerbie bombing, although the arms embargo remains. In Tripoli, meanwhile, the official Jana news agency said reports about the seizure of Scud missile parts were aimed at damaging the improving relations between Libya and Britain.",

      "bodyText": "Eight months after Scotland won self-government, the English backlash finally emerged last night in an unlikely alliance between the home secretary and the Tory leader. That, at any rate, was the view from a band of English nationalists - Labour activists, Tory worthies and middle-class romantics - who believe devolution for the Celtic fringes will inevitably result in big changes at Westminster. Optimism was fuelled by Jack Straw's comments on Radio 4 about Scottish and Welsh home rule provoking a \"rising sense of Englishness\". William Hague followed with an apocalyptic warning about the break-up of Britain, but Mr Straw is the first senior minister to imply that the government may have to consider remodelling Westminster to remove anomalies created by devolution. As a minister whose department covers the UK, as well as specific English issues such as law and order, the home secretary's intervention could be born out of frustration. He is known to be uneasy over a mounting campaign in the Scottish parliament to challenge the new asylum and immigration act, under which refugees will be given food vouchers, rather than cash, to buy life's essentials. Stretching the uneasy settlement between Westminster and Edinburgh to its limits, some MSPs want to wrench control of immigration from the home office. Along with some cabinet colleagues, Mr Straw is said to feel that the Scottish challenge on student tuition fees - which could see the Edinburgh parliament introducing an alternative post-graduation tax linked to income - is designed to embarrass British ministers. Like other senior ministers, he doubtless believes that the interim financial settlement between London and Edinburgh, which guarantees the Scots a level of public spending over 20% per head higher than England, is unsustainable in the medium term. Northern MPs - Mr Straw represents Blackburn - are also feeling the heat from councillors and party activists who think their regions are under-performing because of this generous support. Last night the home secretary was careful to keep his comments on a philosophical level, noting that \"as we move into this new century, people's sense of Englishness will become more articulated and that is partly because of the mirror that devolution provides us with\". But that was enough to prompt Mr Straw's old Commons adversary, Lord (Kenneth) Baker, to send the home secretary his latest book, Children's English History in Verse, which includes the Chesterton lines: \"Smile at us, pay us, pass us; but do not quite forget. For we are the people of England, that have never spoken yet\". Lord Baker, like Mr Straw, sees the stirrings of an English backlash. \"It's most extraordinary that ministers should now stumble on devolution as a problem when it's a problem they've created,\" he said. He sees an English parliament as inevitable to counter a \"grossly unfair\" post-devolution settlement to Scotland and Wales. Lord Baker asked: \"Why should Scottish and Welsh nationalism be a noble thing, when nationalism in England is seen as something dirty?\" Like many Westminster parliamentarians - Tory and, privately, Labour - Lord Baker is outraged by the government's inability to tackle the so-called West Lothian question, first raised by Tam Dalyell, the anti-devolution MP for that former Scottish constituency. It asks why Scottish MPs are still allowed to vote on English issues when English members no longer have an equivalent right over Scottish affairs. This is one reason why Mr Hague briefly flirted with the idea of an English parliament after winning the Tory leadership. He soon backed off, but he told Radio 4 last night that devolution to Edinburgh and Cardiff had brought a \"rise of an English political consciousness.\" Like many, he has recently seen one symbolic change in England - substitution of the union flag with the red and white of St George. \"You would never have seen that a couple of years ago,\" he said. But has English nationalism grown deeper cultural, and political roots beyond the chanting at Wembley? Tony Linsell would like to think so. In truth, he's not so sure. As a founder of the Campaign for an English Parliament, he's set up a website from his Anglo-Saxon bookshop in Kings Lynn, Norfolk. Its policy statement invokes Chesterton, urging the people of England to \"wake up\". It calls for an English devolution referendum, similar to exercises held in Scotland and Wales. But Linsell laments: \"We've got trouble getting any publicity, but someone must care.\" According to a small band of Labour members, who briefly flirted with Linsell's enterprise before launching their own campaign, some activists are being converted to the logic of an English parliament in a quasi-federal UK. \"There's a strong case on the left for a radical perspective in the way England is run,\" says Steve Richards, a Labour member from Lewisham, in south-east London. \"There's a certain inevitability about an English parliament.\" For many, however, this remains a fanciful notion. \"Although there is a theological case pursued by a few, it doesn't answer the real problem of people in the English regions wanting more control over their own affairs,\" says Alan Beith, Berwick MP and the Lib Dems' deputy leader. \"An English parliament, far away in London, offers nothing for areas like the north-east or Cornwall.\"",

      "bodyText": "An attempt by the Conservative leadership to tarnish the name of Shaun Woodward backfired last night when he released a secret Tory document which accused Margaret Thatcher of destroying the national health service. The former Tory director of communications, who defected to Labour last month, opened his files after Conservative central office released an edited version of his 1992 general election \"war book\" which described Neil Kinnock as having an \"evil temper\". The Tory vice-chairman, Tim Collins, sent the document to Labour constituency chairmen across Britain in an attempt to block Mr Woodward's chances of securing a safe Labour seat at the next election. But Mr Woodward immediately pointed out that the document, which assessed the strengths and weaknesses of the main political parties, contained much more damaging details about the Tories. The document, drawn up by the Tories' advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi before the 1992 election, said the party was vulnerable to Labour attacks that it had destroyed the NHS since its election. The document also said Labour would win votes by claiming that Tories did not care about children or educational standards. Mr Woodward, who took his seat as a Labour MP yesterday, said he had planned to keep the document secret, but he would now pass it to Labour's Millbank headquarters because of the \"extreme foolishness\" of Mr Collins in leaking edited highlights. \"This reveals a lack of judgment which is all about short term political gain, rather than what is in the interests of a determined opposition,\" Mr Woodward said. Mr Collins, who served under Mr Woodward as a press officer in 1992, had hoped to restore his reputation by unearthing the \"war book\". The document said Mr Kinnock had an \"evil temper\" and that his \"understanding of economic policy is nil\". After Mr Woodward's retaliation, however, questions were once again being raised about Mr Collins's judgment. Last month he came close to being fired when it emerged he had orchestrated attacks on Steven Norris which briefly blocked the ex-minister's bid to become London mayor. The row over the \"war book\" came after Mr Woodward was given a distinctly lukewarm reception in the Commons by Labour traditionalists such as Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn, who described him as a \"fair weather friend\".",

      "body": "<p>Hey, kids, want to know how to steal a car without breaking any windows? How to drive it away without leaving any fingerprints? Want to know how to empty a pay phone without setting off the alarm? Or how to get that diamond ring you've swallowed in the shop out of your system? (Here's the advice of a blowsy old jewel thief: \"Just drink a bottle of olive oil, and leave it to nature to get out at the other end - bit messy, but a nice few quid at the end of the day.\") These nuggets come from the second episode of Behind The Crime, a four-part series that starts tonight (Channel 4, 9pm) and claims to take us into the lives of the everyday folk who take your car or break into your home. Along the way, they happen to tell you how they make off with a motor or the family silver. </p> <p>Series producer Alex Sutherland is relaxed about the risk of corrupting the nation's youth. \"For legal reasons,\" she remarks, \"we had to remove crucial elements of the actual detail. We weren't able to do just a how-to video manual of getting into a car or stealing money from a telephone box. There is no way a viewer can freeze-frame it and know how to do it. And for the most part, our criminals had some skills to their operations - not anyone could do what they do.\" Maybe not, although a sharp-eyed practising thief might pick up a few advanced techniques from the programme. But Channel 4 is protected by the same British logic that means you can have erect penises in arthouse films like The Idiots, but not in porn: no need to be alarmed, only the educated middle classes are watching. </p> <p>There is a lot that is good about Behind The Crime. Just getting this many - three per programme - working or recently retired, non-celebrity criminals on camera is an impressive journalistic feat. It is free from annoying silhouettes, desperately unconvincing disguises and distorted voices: instead we get the lawbreakers openly talking from their living rooms.

      "bodyText": "Hey, kids, want to know how to steal a car without breaking any windows? How to drive it away without leaving any fingerprints? Want to know how to empty a pay phone without setting off the alarm? Or how to get that diamond ring you've swallowed in the shop out of your system? (Here's the advice of a blowsy old jewel thief: \"Just drink a bottle of olive oil, and leave it to nature to get out at the other end - bit messy, but a nice few quid at the end of the day.\") These nuggets come from the second episode of Behind The Crime, a four-part series that starts tonight (Channel 4, 9pm) and claims to take us into the lives of the everyday folk who take your car or break into your home. Along the way, they happen to tell you how they make off with a motor or the family silver. Series producer Alex Sutherland is relaxed about the risk of corrupting the nation's youth. \"For legal reasons,\" she remarks, \"we had to remove crucial elements of the actual detail. We weren't able to do just a how-to video manual of getting into a car or stealing money from a telephone box. There is no way a viewer can freeze-frame it and know how to do it. And for the most part, our criminals had some skills to their operations - not anyone could do what they do.\" Maybe not, although a sharp-eyed practising thief might pick up a few advanced techniques from the programme. But Channel 4 is protected by the same British logic that means you can have erect penises in arthouse films like The Idiots, but not in porn: no need to be alarmed, only the educated middle classes are watching. There is a lot that is good about Behind The Crime. Just getting this many - three per programme - working or recently retired, non-celebrity criminals on camera is an impressive journalistic feat. It is free from annoying silhouettes, desperately unconvincing disguises and distorted voices: instead we get the lawbreakers openly talking from their living rooms. And there's even some pure comedy: at one stage, the camera follows two phone-box thieves going into a police station to reclaim \u00a31,000 worth of loose change from the police because they hadn't technically been charged with stealing it. When Sutherland talks about the programmes, she could be one of those unfairly maligned 70s sociology researchers.

      "body": "<p>In raising the question of why London university failed to establish the first institute of criminology, Terence Morris, in his obituary of Sir Leon Radzinowicz (January 1) suggests some chicanery in which Radzinowicz must have played a part. The published home office papers clearly show that London rejected the proposal outright because Hermann Mannheim had already retired and no one in the university had the requisite skills and outstanding personality to lead such a venture. Radzinowicz was the only criminologist in England who had such qualities, and the Cambridge department of criminal science was the only base from which an institute could be developed.</p> <p>Professor Morris gives credence to the view that \"the greater part\" of particular volumes of Radzinowicz's massive and outstanding History of the English Criminal Law was written by his co-workers. Of course he had help in drafting, checking and editing this vast work, but, as joint author of volume five of the History, I can testify to his absorption in the work, encyclopaedic knowledge, brilliance in composition, and attention to every word. To imply some kind of absentee editorship is a travesty to the memory of a great scholar.</p> <p>There is a veiled suggestion that a desire to forge good relations with home office officials is the reason why Radzinowicz's committee favoured dispersing high-risk prisoners rather than concentrating them in one prison as Lord Mountbatten had suggested. Furthermore, that it must have troubled him to go against Mountbatten \"since he was totally sycophantic about royalty\". This is a smear on a man who was totally convinced that whatever the disadvantages of dispersing high-risk prisoners around a few prisons, it was preferable to the Mountbatten alternative of bottling them up in an \"Alcatraz\". His judgment remained fiercely independent, devoted to a liberal conception of penal policy, whatever the home office views might have been.</p> <p>Radzinowicz was the first to acknowledge that he could be a \"difficult man\" and that, in his determination to build up the Cambridge Institute within a few years into an international centre of excellence, he had been \"rough and tough\". But he had also been \"rough and tough\" on himself. He worked with prodigious energy and demanded from his colleagues the same dedication. It is hardly surprising that they felt the stress. But nearly all of them admired his intellectual vitality and came to recognise that he had galvanised them to play a part in a remarkable achievement. Twenty-eight former colleagues, pupils and admirers contributed to his festschrift in 1974. Aged 87, his address to the British Criminology Conference received a standing ovation.</p> <p>He could be demanding - but he was also charming, witty, generous, loyal, an extraordinary judge of character and brilliant company. Life with Sir Leon was never dull.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In raising the question of why London university failed to establish the first institute of criminology, Terence Morris, in his obituary of Sir Leon Radzinowicz (January 1) suggests some chicanery in which Radzinowicz must have played a part. The published home office papers clearly show that London rejected the proposal outright because Hermann Mannheim had already retired and no one in the university had the requisite skills and outstanding personality to lead such a venture. Radzinowicz was the only criminologist in England who had such qualities, and the Cambridge department of criminal science was the only base from which an institute could be developed. Professor Morris gives credence to the view that \"the greater part\" of particular volumes of Radzinowicz's massive and outstanding History of the English Criminal Law was written by his co-workers. Of course he had help in drafting, checking and editing this vast work, but, as joint author of volume five of the History, I can testify to his absorption in the work, encyclopaedic knowledge, brilliance in composition, and attention to every word. To imply some kind of absentee editorship is a travesty to the memory of a great scholar. There is a veiled suggestion that a desire to forge good relations with home office officials is the reason why Radzinowicz's committee favoured dispersing high-risk prisoners rather than concentrating them in one prison as Lord Mountbatten had suggested. Furthermore, that it must have troubled him to go against Mountbatten \"since he was totally sycophantic about royalty\". This is a smear on a man who was totally convinced that whatever the disadvantages of dispersing high-risk prisoners around a few prisons, it was preferable to the Mountbatten alternative of bottling them up in an \"Alcatraz\". His judgment remained fiercely independent, devoted to a liberal conception of penal policy, whatever the home office views might have been. Radzinowicz was the first to acknowledge that he could be a \"difficult man\" and that, in his determination to build up the Cambridge Institute within a few years into an international centre of excellence, he had been \"rough and tough\". But he had also been \"rough and tough\" on himself. He worked with prodigious energy and demanded from his colleagues the same dedication. It is hardly surprising that they felt the stress. But nearly all of them admired his intellectual vitality and came to recognise that he had galvanised them to play a part in a remarkable achievement. Twenty-eight former colleagues, pupils and admirers contributed to his festschrift in 1974. Aged 87, his address to the British Criminology Conference received a standing ovation. He could be demanding - but he was also charming, witty, generous, loyal, an extraordinary judge of character and brilliant company. Life with Sir Leon was never dull.",

      "body": "<p>World famous for his investigation in the mid-1950s of the mysterious and catastrophic crashes of De Havilland Comet 1 jet airliners, Sir Arnold Hall has died aged 84. The brilliant aeronautical engineer, scientist and industrialist designed the compressor for Frank Whittle's first jet engine, shaped the gyroscopic gun-sights in D-day fighter aircraft, defended the aerospace industry against nationalisation and built the giant Hawker Siddeley Group.</p> <p>Hall's Comet investigation brought new technical profundity to complex failure analysis and is still seen as the model for major aviation inquiries. It revealed the scale of his reach as a scientist and administrator, and his calmness in crisis.</p> <p>When the first passenger-service Comet took off from Heathrow on May 2 1952, Britain's aviation industry and its major operator, the British Overseas Airways Corporation, led the world into the era of high-altitude, high-speed civil jet flight. After De Havilland's costly and seemingly exhaustive test programmes, the world's most advanced and elegant passenger aircraft appeared to be as safe and sound as prudent engineering could make it. Orders flooded in.</p> <p>In those grey post-war years, the Comet 1 was a symbol of confidence and national recovery, a harbinger of future successes for British industry and enterprise in a new and hard world. But after only two years in commercial service, three Comets failed catastrophically in flight - the last one only a few days after a normal but very costly investigation into the second accident had given the aircraft the all-clear. There was despair in industry and near-panic in government.</p> <p>All Comets were grounded, all contracts were put on hold and the nation, already mourning the dead of the accidents, went into mourning for itself. At this crucial time Hall, then the youngest-ever director of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, was approached by the government for advice. Experts in industry and conventional investigations could produce no explanation: there were suggestions of terrorist bombs and unknown high-altitude atmospheric phenomena. Neither Lennox Boyd (miniser of transport and civil aviation) nor Duncan Sandys (supply) knew what to do or how to save British aviation prestige.</p> <p>Hall's response was decisive. The industry could not be left floundering in the face of huge investigation costs, nor could the mystery be left unsolved. However unpalatable the idea was to government, the Farnborough teams had to be brought in to carry out an independent investigation of all possible causes - a huge open-ended requirement. Within a couple of days, Sandys gave the go-ahead and, within weeks, Hall had decided that some crucial stress calculations were of such complexity that mathematical theory alone could not be relied upon to provide answers.</p> <p>Hall promptly built Farnborough's famous \"whole pressurised aircraft\" test rig, in which the stresses of flight cycles could be simulated rapidly many thousands of times on a complete aircraft. The outcome, clinched by early and massive failure of the test aircraft's pressurised cabin, explained the catastrophes, provided new knowledge of aluminium alloys under repeated stress, gave new meaning to the concept of \"fatigue life\", and revealed the unexpected inadequacy of conventional and hitherto highly trusted methods of stress testing and analysis.</p> <p>Within two years, these findings led to the modified and very successful De Havil land Comet 4; but by then the US, and to a lesser extent France, had caught up with the British aircraft industry and the world market slipped away. For Hall, this period at Farnborough, during which he had expanded its activities, forged strong links with research establishments in Europe and the US and received a knighthood (aged just 39), was a major turning point.</p> <p>He was by choice an academic; now Whitehall wanted him to stay. Instead, when his Farnborough agreement came to an end in 1955, he moved into industry, first as technical director of the Hawker Siddeley Group, then as managing director of the new group member Bristol Siddeley Engines and, later still, as vice-chairman and chairman of the entire group. In 1962 he chaired an Anglo-French Concorde design group then, in the costly wake of cancellation of three of Hawker's military aircraft projects and under growing political pressure for nationalisation of the aircraft industry, Hall broadened the base of the group so that aircraft and engines were no longer dominant. \"I felt a great responsibility to the companies we had taken over and to the people we employed. I did what I could to protect them,\" Hall recalled.</p> <p>By the mid-1970s, when the Hawker Siddeley Group employed about 85,000 people, 50,000 were engaged in electrical and other forms of civil engineering. Hall, driven by the spirit of private enterprise and professional responsibility which he saw as essential to the creation of an effective industrial base, was vigorously and openly hostile to the government's nationalisation proposals. When the axe fell in 1977 (by a single vote in the Commons), Hall left the aircraft industry for good.</p> <p>To some this was surprising, for he was very much one of CP Snow's \"new men of industry\" - men who, themselves technically expert, accelerated the decision-making process by downward diffusion to other experts in specific fields, and evolved a formula particularly suited to shaping high-technology projects. Hall's decision to keep Hawker in the eventually highly successful A300 (European Airbus) project after the British government had pulled out emphasised his gifts and made the government look very slow-witted.</p> <p>Speculation that Hall would or could be appointed as supremo of the nationalised aircraft and shipbuilding industries was misplaced, for he was neither temperamentally nor politically acceptable. When appointed Businessman of the Year in 1975 for his \"vision, courage and commercial discipline\" in turning Hawker Siddeley into one of the world's most efficient industries, he said flatly that he wanted no part in any nationalisation programme. When he later spoke of being \"deeply saddened\" by the enforced takeover of a third of his industrial group, he was perhaps making the understatement of the century.</p> <p>Hall retired in 1986, but continued to keep in touch with his scientific specialities through the Royal Society (fellow, 1953) and the Royal Aeronautical Society, of which he was president 1958-59.</p> <p>His flexibility and enormous breadth of grasp are revealed by the fact that not only was he a brilliant success in the very different worlds of academic research, government laboratory administration, high-tech management and industrial development, but he was also a Whitehall insider and adviser in whom Lord Zuckerman, as chief government scientist, declared great trust.</p> <p>Born in Liverpool to parents who had left school at 12, Arnold Hall grew up during the depression. Many of his older relatives were involved in maritime activities, but his father was an upholsterer and his mother a brilliant self-taught pianist. \"My mother tried to teach me, but I'm afraid I was something of a disappointment to her. My interests were always in engineering and science,\" Hall recalled. \"I was too busy making steam engines and other gadgets.\"</p> <p>His mathematical gifts and his potential in science and engineering emerged clearly at Alsop High School at Walton, then an all-boys school, to which he won a scholarship. Sheer brilliance took him to Clare College, Cambridge, where, in addition to a first, he won the Moir Prize in Engineering, the Seely Prize in Aeronautics and the Ricardo Prize in Thermodynamics.

South Carolina, where the first shots of rebellion were fired in April 1861, is the only one of the 50 united states still to fly the flag of the pro-slavery Confederacy from the top of its state legislature building. And thousands of white confederate supporters who rallied in its shadow in Columbia, the state capital, at the weekend intend to keep it that way. The flag issue is becoming an increasingly emotive political flashpoint, with inescapable racial overtones. The National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP) has called for South Carolina to be subjected to the kind of economic boycott that was so effective during the civil rights campaigns in the racially segregated south in the 1960s. An NAACP parade and rally is scheduled for Columbia on Monday, Martin Luther King Day. \"There is a clear right side in this debate,\" said the South Carolina NAACP executive director, Dwight James, who believes that the flag is an insulting symbol of the south's slave-owning past. \"I clearly believe the flag has no legitimate place on the statehouse grounds.\" On Saturday, an estimated 7,000 pro-flag supporters - many of them in 19th century costume - rallied at Columbia's confederate cemetery before parading to the sounds of Dixie and other \"Rebel\" marches to the statehouse. \"If any house or senate members vote to bring down this flag, will you work to destroy them?\" Ron Wilson of the Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV) asked the crowd. \"Yes,\" shouted back the crowd. Their threat is a real one, as the former South Carolina Republican governor David Beasley discovered in 1998 when he was defeated after saying that he thought the flag should come down. So-called \"southern heritage\" groups are threatening to do the same thing to his successor, Democrat Jim Hodges, who has been holding private talks to try to find a compromise on the issue. \"He had better enjoy the next two years and 10 months,\" Ron Russell of the SCV told Saturday's rally. \"Because that's all he's got.\" The confederate flag has only flown from the South Carolina statehouse since 1962, when it was hoisted as part of a civil war centennial.

      "bodyText": "The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, yesterday pressed Iran to take a less hostile approach to the Middle East peace process during the first visit to Britain by a senior Iranian minister since the revolution 20 years ago. The arrival of Kamal Kharrazi, the Iranian foreign minister, was met with protests by Jewish groups and Iranian dissidents. Iran caused consternation at the end of last month in Israel - a sometime ally - when it suddenly adopted a strident tone, with one leader calling for the state's eradication. Mr Kharrazi met Tony Blair at Downing Street before two hours of talks with Mr Cook. The visit is part of a gradual restoration in relations between the two countries, and could eventually pave the way for the reopening of links between the US and Iran. The improvement in British-Iranian relations began two years ago when the Iranian government distanced itself from the clerical fatwa issued against the British author Salman Rushdie in 1989 for alleged blasphemous writing. But US sources claim Iran has stepped up arms and funds to groups such as Hizbullah, which is fighting in southern Lebanon, and a se nior foreign office spokesman confirmed that there were continued contacts between Iran and groups violently opposed to the Middle East peace process. The foreign office spokesman defended the British-Iran link, saying: \"We think it is better to put our views across than cut them off.\" He added that recent hardline rhetoric against Israel had to be seen in the context of the Iranian elections, in six weeks' time. Mr Cook, who negotiated with Iran in 1998 to get the government to distance itself from the fatwa, raised the issue of Mr Rushdie at yesterday's meeting. The foreign secretary has been criticised for failing to win a commitment to suppress organisations inside Iran still offering a bounty for the author's assassination. Mr Cook also pressed Mr Kharrazi to ensure a fair trial for a group of Jewish and Muslim Iranians alleged to have spied for Israel. The president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, Eldred Tabachnik, yesterday expressed concern about the 13 Iranian Jews in detention: \"No charges have been proferred and they have, nonetheless, been held for almost a year.\" Mr Blair's spokesman said yesterday's visit should not be interpreted as a sign that Britain endorsed everything going on inside Iran.",

      "bodyText": "French hauliers decided last night to maintain their blocking of frontier posts, motorways and main roads today in protest at the price of fuel and the introduction of a 35-hour week. Border posts into Italy, Germany, Spain and Belgium were blocked as hundreds of trucks took part in the first day of action by lorry owners yesterday. Police warned that the situation would probably be worse today. The worst chaos was in the north, where protesters disrupted traffic on the main routes south from the Channel ports by setting up roadblocks or driving at low speed in three lanes. Access was left open to Calais and Boulogne, but truck owners made it difficult for cars to board the cross-Channel ferry at Le Havre. The owners' spokesman, St\u00e9phane Levesque, said a 35-hour week would put businesses \"at a further disadvantage\" compared with other EU countries. But drivers' unions have told the transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, that concessions over the 35-hour week would lead to a counter-strike by employees.",

In it, the author, granddaughter of a one-time president of General Motors, looked at how the attainment of great wealth often proves to be a hollow achievement, often accompanied by extreme anxiety and a raft of other emotional and psychological fears which get passed on to their heirs.</p> <p>Of course, the problems of inheritance are not new, but they recently gained a sense of urgency for newly-rich baby-boomers who began to consider retirement - and their inevitable demise. Now, with many more overnight plutocrats wondering just how to handle their assets, and the well-documented examples of trust fund babies going off the rails serving as grim cautionary tales, there is a new resolve to try to circumvent the pitfalls of inherited wealth.</p> <p>Last year, Bill Gates, the world's richest man, announced that he and his wife would restrict their two children's inheritance to $100 million and leave the rest of what is projected to grow to a $1 trillion estate to charity and philanthropic foundations. America' s second richest man, Warren Buffett, said he would do the same, in the hope that by leaving his children a relatively paltry amount they will have the drive to do something for themselves.</p> <p>While this may or may not protect the Gates and Buffet children from catching affluenza, other antidotes to the problems of inherited wealth are being tried. Some millionaires, by creating built-in incentives, have begun linking the transfer of wealth to an acceptance by their children of parental values. Estate planners setting up inheritance trusts are increasingly being asked to make provisions to deny payments, for instance, if children don't set up pre-nuptial agreements, or if they fail periodic drug tests.</p> <p>One Florida millionaire, whose son has anxiety attacks, stipulated that the boy should only receive payments if he has treatment. Another tycoon, whose brother died in a car crash, has instructed that his children would only receive money if their driving licences were clean.</p> <p>Elsewhere, in contrast, financial re-wards would come with charitable work, helping in family foundations, or more generally adhering to specially drawn-up \"family mission statements\". Incentives not to blow the inheritance take other forms, too, such as by tying future trust pay-outs to audits of the deployment of wealth already received.</p> <p>\"We see more and more of these 'incentive' trusts that give the trustee the framework to make sure the intended results become reality,\" says Cooper. Another technique is to delay the passing of wealth. \"In prior generations giving access to their inheritance at 25 was common. Now we see families wanting to pass it later in life and wanting to dribble it out at 40 or 45. Or perhaps they'll get a first taste earlier, so if they have trouble hanging on to it at least they'll have a second or third bite of the apple.</p> <p>\"The issue of how, and how much, wealth to leave children is probably one of the most serious issues our clients face,\" says Cooper. \"The whole issue of providing resources to ward against the affluenza bug is a common theme that we see . Horror stories abound, so the families come to us to ask how they can take measures so their children don't turn out that way.\"</p> <p>Parents want to be able to encourage their children to do good, but they don't want to give them so much money that there's nothing left to achieve. \"It' s a balancing act,\" he says.</p>",

In it, the author, granddaughter of a one-time president of General Motors, looked at how the attainment of great wealth often proves to be a hollow achievement, often accompanied by extreme anxiety and a raft of other emotional and psychological fears which get passed on to their heirs. Of course, the problems of inheritance are not new, but they recently gained a sense of urgency for newly-rich baby-boomers who began to consider retirement - and their inevitable demise. Now, with many more overnight plutocrats wondering just how to handle their assets, and the well-documented examples of trust fund babies going off the rails serving as grim cautionary tales, there is a new resolve to try to circumvent the pitfalls of inherited wealth. Last year, Bill Gates, the world's richest man, announced that he and his wife would restrict their two children's inheritance to $100 million and leave the rest of what is projected to grow to a $1 trillion estate to charity and philanthropic foundations. America' s second richest man, Warren Buffett, said he would do the same, in the hope that by leaving his children a relatively paltry amount they will have the drive to do something for themselves. While this may or may not protect the Gates and Buffet children from catching affluenza, other antidotes to the problems of inherited wealth are being tried. Some millionaires, by creating built-in incentives, have begun linking the transfer of wealth to an acceptance by their children of parental values. Estate planners setting up inheritance trusts are increasingly being asked to make provisions to deny payments, for instance, if children don't set up pre-nuptial agreements, or if they fail periodic drug tests. One Florida millionaire, whose son has anxiety attacks, stipulated that the boy should only receive payments if he has treatment. Another tycoon, whose brother died in a car crash, has instructed that his children would only receive money if their driving licences were clean. Elsewhere, in contrast, financial re-wards would come with charitable work, helping in family foundations, or more generally adhering to specially drawn-up \"family mission statements\". Incentives not to blow the inheritance take other forms, too, such as by tying future trust pay-outs to audits of the deployment of wealth already received. \"We see more and more of these 'incentive' trusts that give the trustee the framework to make sure the intended results become reality,\" says Cooper. Another technique is to delay the passing of wealth. \"In prior generations giving access to their inheritance at 25 was common. Now we see families wanting to pass it later in life and wanting to dribble it out at 40 or 45. Or perhaps they'll get a first taste earlier, so if they have trouble hanging on to it at least they'll have a second or third bite of the apple. \"The issue of how, and how much, wealth to leave children is probably one of the most serious issues our clients face,\" says Cooper. \"The whole issue of providing resources to ward against the affluenza bug is a common theme that we see . Horror stories abound, so the families come to us to ask how they can take measures so their children don't turn out that way.\" Parents want to be able to encourage their children to do good, but they don't want to give them so much money that there's nothing left to achieve. \"It' s a balancing act,\" he says.",

It will be quizzed about the $18m (\u00a311m) claim against TransTec which remained under wraps for more than three years. \"[It] almost defies belief that the auditors didn't know about it,\" said one accountancy regulation insider. Receivers are also investigating the fact that $12m was paid to the claimant, the motor group Ford, but presumably was described in TransTec's books as something else. PwC is awaiting the verdict of a professional tribunal examining its auditing of Barings, the merchant bank brought to its knees in early 1995 by the \u00a3800m-plus losses run up on Far Eastern markets by rogue trader Nick Leeson. The tribunal is expected to report by the end of this month. In addition, the profession's disciplinary machine is looking at PwC's role as auditor of Resort Hotels, which went into liquidation six years ago with debts of \u00a3140m. Resort's founder, Robert Feld, was convicted of 12 charges of fraud and forgery, most relating to a \u00a320m rights issue in 1992. Feld had lied about Resort's profit forecasts and its indebtedness to ensure the rights issue succeeded. TransTec's automotive divi sion supplied Ford with cylinder heads made at its Campsie plant near Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Ford issued an $18m suit against TransTec in mid-1996 after allegedly late deliveries. PwC unearthed details of the claim and the fact $12m had been paid only late last year -more than three years after the original demand. The fact that the $12m was not clearly flagged in the books as payment to Ford for part of the claim could prove serious for TransTec, and might trigger an inquiry by the serious fraud office. Yesterday the SFO said it had no immediate plans to investigate. TransTec is adamant that Mr Robinson, who left the board on becoming a minister in 1997, knew nothing of the claim nor the payment.",

And for their part, women of a certain size very often view posing for a photograph as a form of ritual humiliation. </p> <p>How very strange, then, that a world-class photographer, Patrick Lichfield, and a Derbyshire diet club, Slimming World (catchphrase: Turning Dreams Into Reality), should have joined forces to produce a fly-on-the-wall exhibition at a London gallery aiming to celebrate the curious culture of weight-loss. </p> <p>\"Yes, it did take people a while to get their heads round the idea,\" agrees Claire Crowther, editor of Slimming World magazine. She should know: she was the one who came up with the scheme in the first place, not from any high-minded artistic motive but because she could never find any slimming club shots for her magazine. \"We chose Lord Lichfield because we wanted to get a photographer who would really bring charisma to the project. I mean, we could've just got any old photographer to come along and take some snaps of the clubs, but that wouldn't have been the point. </p> <p>\"I wanted someone who could document the journey a slimmer makes when losing weight - we want to use the pictures for training purposes. Our members go through a whole gamut of emotions during the struggle. He built up a real rapport with all the women at the club.\" </p> <p>Within seconds of meeting Lord L it becomes apparent that he does indeed enjoy a rapport with women. He stares hypnotically into my eyes and strokes my arm as he reveals why he felt compelled to spend several days skulking round community halls in Derbyshire and the Wirral listening to earnest discussions about eating plans and empowerment. \"I was amazed by all the women I met - they were the happiest, most confident women I have ever worked with,\" he declares. </p> <p>What, happier and more confident than his royal cousin? He glares: there is a strict veto on questions about \"Her Maj\" and Diana. Well, then, happier and more confident than all the supermodels he's worked with? \"Much happier,\" he booms. </p> <p>So he didn't feel guilty meeting all these overweight women desperate to look like the models he photographs? Clearly not. \"Those models, a lot of them are miserable. Personally, I think women look better if they eat healthily and are happy with themselves. A lot of models, in my experience, are not.\" </p> <p>The members of the two clubs he visited were clearly overawed by the experience of working with someone of his greatness. \"He said to me, 'Elle McPherson yesterday, you lot today.' That made me feel fantastic,\" says Gaynor Budd, whose portrait appears in the exhibition. She lost seven stone with the club and has come down for the private view from Liverpool to drink champagne (\"Not many calories in that\") and to nibble calorie-controlled canap\u00e9s (smoked salmon and caviar; avocado was banned at the 11th hour). \"I don't think anyone minded being photographed: we were thrilled to have a lord come to visit us. I'm not sure if he knew what to make of us, though - one lady gave him a card and I think it might've been a bit rude.\" </p> <p>Was there not a feeling of resentment towards a man who is, after all, one of those responsible for creating impossible ideals of the female form through his photography? \"No. Even if we didn't see photos of slim models, we'd still want to be slim,\" she says. \"It's great to see women like us being celebrated by a man like Lord Lichfield - I think it's very empowering for larger women everywhere.\" </p> <p>Gaynor Budd's portrait, where she sits in a crowded room engrossed in a copy of Slimming World magazine, is the photographer's favourite picture. Somehow the image captures the obsessive, almost evangelical fervour that possesses the souls of club members. \"There is a great atmosphere - it's very supportive. We help one another through the hard times, if we fall by the wayside,\" she explains. The vocabulary of Slimming World soon begins to sound peculiarly religious. Meetings do sound like non-secular gatherings, with up to 500 members attending. There is even talk of sin, though in a positive way: members are allowed 10 sins - forbidden treats - a week. </p> <p>\"The atmosphere is incredible. There's a lot of emotion going on, elation and real sadness,\" explains Lichfield. \"I tried to be as unobtrusive as possible within the parameters of what I was trying to achieve. Mostly, I think they didn't notice me. I didn't use any flash so it was easy to blend in.\" With his formidable silver mane and plummy vowels, this does sound a tad unlikely, but we'll take his word for it. \"In my mind I knew that I wanted to produce reportage, picking up on all the quirky, unexpected aspects of the women's experiences. I opted to do the whole thing in black and white because I find that has a timeless quality. Looking back at some of my old colour portraits, I realise how dated colour prints look - things like make-up and clothes don't age well. I'm very pleased with the results.\" </p> <p>Certainly, the series of 36 grainy shots is surprising territory for Lichfield, a man who has staked his reputation on keeping his family photo album up to date with glossy portraits, working with the world's top models and actresses and doing some more worrying extra-curricular activities - the Unipart calendar and the illustrated guide to Harrow School among them. He claims that he took this assignment because he was given a great deal of discretion - although given how frequently Slimming World magazine sneaks into the photos, this sounds a bit dubious. \"No, no, they really did give me a very wide-open brief. I wanted to do reportage, I wanted to do something different and so I went with it.\" </p> <p>What does he think of Rankin and other younger photographers, the ones who pioneered CCTV-style reportage? \"Well, what people forget is that it's very easy as a photographer to experiment - that doesn't take skill. What takes the skill is being able to buckle down to a commercial brief. The guys I respect are the ones who slave away photographing boiled eggs for ad agencies. Sooner or later these young guys are going to have to do that and I'll be interested to see how they develop then. Meanwhile, I'll be pleased to put this new work in my portfolio. It's something really different for me and I hope it'll make people realise that there's another side to me.\" </p> <p>Still, it's unlikely that Dazed &amp; Confused will be rushing to book him. With this exhibition, there is a strong sense not of the photographer trying to rise above his material but of quite the reverse. In one photo, two women hug; one face is hidden, the other etched with unabashed glee, the source of which we can only assume to be colossal weight loss. Yet the shot is a soft-focus blur, as if the photographer has smeared Vaseline over the lens to make these ordinary creatures look more at home in his starry portfolio. In another, the same woman looks down lovingly at a large peach - a great idea, but since it's a head-and-shoulders pose, we have no idea that this woman is overweight.

One, that working women are stressing out their male partners by discussing business problems around the family hearthside. Secondly, that doing voluntary overtime can actually be good for your health.</p> <p>Now it doesn't take a degree in rocket science to fathom why blokes are suffering fits of the vapours at the prospect of long winter nights swapping tales of office squabbles as they fork through a microwaved lasagne.</p> <p>The first, and possibly most important, factor is that men are finally beginning to experience what it is like to be on the receiving - rather than spewing - end of a torrent of work-related angst. \"Guess what happened in the office today\" is the precursor to some of the most petty, mind-numbing and depressing monologues ever spoken in the history of useless oratory.</p> <p>If women find it less stressful to listen then I can only suppose - in the best Men Are From Mars tradition of sexual inequality - that it is because we have developed better coping and masking techniques over the years.</p> <p>So, to help men in their struggle to manage this new phenomenon without cardiovascular combustion, here are some tips from the professionals:</p> <p><strong>When she gets home</strong></p> <p>\u0095 never start a conversation the minute your partner walks in through the door. Commuting is stressful and even a simple enquiry like \"Would you like a cup of tea?\" or \"How was your day?\" can cause a pressure hotspot and consequent curt reply. Follow-up comments like \"I only asked\" or \"You never tell me anything\" are hugely unhelpful.</p> <p>\u0095 wait until your partner has unpacked and changed before attempting conversation. Never instigate the subject matter, just smile helpfully and be fragrant.</p> <p><strong>When she's talking </strong></p> <p>\u0095 always use eye contact when listening, to imply undivided attention.

      "bodyText": "A trawl through the latest business research chucks up two - possibly connected - conclusions. One, that working women are stressing out their male partners by discussing business problems around the family hearthside. Secondly, that doing voluntary overtime can actually be good for your health. Now it doesn't take a degree in rocket science to fathom why blokes are suffering fits of the vapours at the prospect of long winter nights swapping tales of office squabbles as they fork through a microwaved lasagne. The first, and possibly most important, factor is that men are finally beginning to experience what it is like to be on the receiving - rather than spewing - end of a torrent of work-related angst. \"Guess what happened in the office today\" is the precursor to some of the most petty, mind-numbing and depressing monologues ever spoken in the history of useless oratory. If women find it less stressful to listen then I can only suppose - in the best Men Are From Mars tradition of sexual inequality - that it is because we have developed better coping and masking techniques over the years. So, to help men in their struggle to manage this new phenomenon without cardiovascular combustion, here are some tips from the professionals: When she gets home \u0095 never start a conversation the minute your partner walks in through the door. Commuting is stressful and even a simple enquiry like \"Would you like a cup of tea?\" or \"How was your day?\" can cause a pressure hotspot and consequent curt reply. Follow-up comments like \"I only asked\" or \"You never tell me anything\" are hugely unhelpful. \u0095 wait until your partner has unpacked and changed before attempting conversation. Never instigate the subject matter, just smile helpfully and be fragrant. When she's talking \u0095 always use eye contact when listening, to imply undivided attention. Never interrupt and never attempt to do any non-vital chores - like blinking or breathing - while listening as this implies a lack of interest. \u0095 adopt the \"You're so right\" or \"I don't know how they can treat you like that\" stance. A good point to make is that \"They're obviously just jealous of your ability\" or \"They haven't promoted you because they feel threatened by your superior knowledge\". Don't worry if these sound insincere or fawning as the troubled worker will never notice. Never ever \u0095 side with the object of your loved one's venom or give the merest hint that they might be in anyway right. They are totally, absolutely wrong in every aspect of their argument and your partner is blameless. \u0095 use the phrases: \"Don't you think that you may be making a big deal of nothing?\"; \"Why don't you just forget it\"; \"You've been moaning about your boss every night for three years now, don't you think it's time you took action?\"; or \"Why don't you just change your job?\". \u0095 yawn or look at your watch \u0095 give advice. Do \u0095 offer alcohol or neck massage \u0095 think of something while listening to avoid going insane. Of course, If the second piece of research is anything to go by men are coping via the avoidance technique: skulking late at the office on the pretext that the working wife will be snoring or too squiffy to talk by the time he gets home. Which would explain why doing overtime may be good for your health.",

Instead, if you stop to look, what strikes you is how well painted they are. God Is No Saint (1935), a bird on a brown shoe, glistens - the dappled petrol-blue sky, the light hitting the leather - and, for all its controversial title and odd content, it's a classic, superbly executed oil painting. </p> <p>Elsewhere, it's the two-dimensional flatness of the paintings that overwhelms (or maybe underwhelms when you are face to face with it, hence the civilised trot in the gallery). That early wallpaper training came in handy in ridding his work of conventional perspective. The Key to the Fields (1936), a view through a shattered window onto a landscape, with the shards of glass imprinted with the scene in view, shows this and more, emphatically foregrounding too the dissolving border between inside and outside (the body, the house, even within words) that so fascinated Magritte. Best of all in turning away from perspective is one of the word-paintings, The Delights of Landscape (1928): an empty gilt picture frame, with the title Paysage, in a dramatically lit room. A gun, the only other object, leans against a blood-red wall. </p> <p>Ironically, given surrealism's exclusive, avant-garde origins, there is something for everyone here. There are well-known paintings, such as Representation (the female torso with its frame cut to her shape) and Golconde, in which it's raining bowler-hatted men, hallelujah! There are a few word-paintings, one example of Magritte's brief Impressionist phase (nasty) and one image painted when he was staying with Dali at Cadaques for a bit of an art historical, biographical buzz. And then there's the joy of hearing parents explain surrealism to tiny tots. \"You see that lady has a leg where her head should be, well...\"</p> <p>Till March 26. Details: 0131-624 6200.</p>",

Elsewhere, it's the two-dimensional flatness of the paintings that overwhelms (or maybe underwhelms when you are face to face with it, hence the civilised trot in the gallery). That early wallpaper training came in handy in ridding his work of conventional perspective. The Key to the Fields (1936), a view through a shattered window onto a landscape, with the shards of glass imprinted with the scene in view, shows this and more, emphatically foregrounding too the dissolving border between inside and outside (the body, the house, even within words) that so fascinated Magritte. Best of all in turning away from perspective is one of the word-paintings, The Delights of Landscape (1928): an empty gilt picture frame, with the title Paysage, in a dramatically lit room. A gun, the only other object, leans against a blood-red wall. Ironically, given surrealism's exclusive, avant-garde origins, there is something for everyone here. There are well-known paintings, such as Representation (the female torso with its frame cut to her shape) and Golconde, in which it's raining bowler-hatted men, hallelujah! There are a few word-paintings, one example of Magritte's brief Impressionist phase (nasty) and one image painted when he was staying with Dali at Cadaques for a bit of an art historical, biographical buzz. And then there's the joy of hearing parents explain surrealism to tiny tots. \"You see that lady has a leg where her head should be, well...\" Till March 26. Details: 0131-624 6200.",

      "body": "<p> An aura of exquisite refinement, of delicate theatricality and sartorial elegance hangs over Melvyn Tan, the cult pianist, born in Singapore, now resident in the UK. Immaculate in a black designer suit, he walks on to the platform with an appealing air of gentle shyness. </p> <p>Part way through the first half of his recital, his jacket is abandoned to reveal yards of flowing silk. After the interval, he's rolled up his shirt sleeves, so we can see all the better the muscularity of his arms and the grace of his gestures. </p> <p>Tan is always fascinating to watch though, on occasion, less impressive to hear. There's something balletic about him, as if his performances are choreographic. His back arches and ripples as he bends over the piano. His hands describe fluid arabesques in the air before lighting on the keys. He sometimes gazes round the auditorium in a seeming state of romantic abstraction. </p> <p>The same grace and refinement characterise his playing, which is rarely less than beautiful, yet sometimes lacks spontaneity, dash and emotional clout. For his Wigmore programme, he chose Beethoven followed by Debussy's Second Book of Preludes, the latter, with its subtle shifts of mood and nuance, suiting him better. The Preludes were written in 1913, on the eve of the first world war, and Tan maintains the uneasy menace that lurks behind the open ing Brouillards (fog) throughout much of the cycle. He briefly breaks the mood with La Puerta del Vino as the Iberian landscape opens to reveal a blinding, crystalline clarity, though its luminosity proves brief and thereafter nostalgia reigns, even in the comic portraits of General Lavine's music hall turns and the grandiloquent buffoonery of Samuel Pickwick. </p> <p>The improvisatory approach which Tan adopts towards Beethoven, feeling his way through the music with an exploratory tentativeness, isn't entirely successful. The G minor Fantasia, its darting scales and hymnic melodies laced with unusual wit, and the opus 119 Bagatelles, mingling naivety with density, come off best. He pulls the opus 101 A major sonata about a bit, however, overdoing the rubato in the first movement and lacking panache in the finale. The quirky match that forms the sonata's scherzo seemed overlong. Only the slow movement, played with rhapsodic fervour, was genuinely breathtaking.</p>",

      "bodyText": "An aura of exquisite refinement, of delicate theatricality and sartorial elegance hangs over Melvyn Tan, the cult pianist, born in Singapore, now resident in the UK. Immaculate in a black designer suit, he walks on to the platform with an appealing air of gentle shyness. Part way through the first half of his recital, his jacket is abandoned to reveal yards of flowing silk. After the interval, he's rolled up his shirt sleeves, so we can see all the better the muscularity of his arms and the grace of his gestures. Tan is always fascinating to watch though, on occasion, less impressive to hear. There's something balletic about him, as if his performances are choreographic. His back arches and ripples as he bends over the piano. His hands describe fluid arabesques in the air before lighting on the keys. He sometimes gazes round the auditorium in a seeming state of romantic abstraction. The same grace and refinement characterise his playing, which is rarely less than beautiful, yet sometimes lacks spontaneity, dash and emotional clout. For his Wigmore programme, he chose Beethoven followed by Debussy's Second Book of Preludes, the latter, with its subtle shifts of mood and nuance, suiting him better. The Preludes were written in 1913, on the eve of the first world war, and Tan maintains the uneasy menace that lurks behind the open ing Brouillards (fog) throughout much of the cycle. He briefly breaks the mood with La Puerta del Vino as the Iberian landscape opens to reveal a blinding, crystalline clarity, though its luminosity proves brief and thereafter nostalgia reigns, even in the comic portraits of General Lavine's music hall turns and the grandiloquent buffoonery of Samuel Pickwick. The improvisatory approach which Tan adopts towards Beethoven, feeling his way through the music with an exploratory tentativeness, isn't entirely successful. The G minor Fantasia, its darting scales and hymnic melodies laced with unusual wit, and the opus 119 Bagatelles, mingling naivety with density, come off best. He pulls the opus 101 A major sonata about a bit, however, overdoing the rubato in the first movement and lacking panache in the finale. The quirky match that forms the sonata's scherzo seemed overlong. Only the slow movement, played with rhapsodic fervour, was genuinely breathtaking.",
