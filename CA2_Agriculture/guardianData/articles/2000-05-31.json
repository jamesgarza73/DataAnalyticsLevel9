It proves a disturbing piece, for beneath its surface froth lurks chilling irony. Spoliansky, one of the greats of Weimar Republic cabaret (he put Marlene Dietrich on the map long before she was discovered by Josef von Sternberg), wrote it in 1932. It has been interpreted as anti-capitalist satire, which is only partly true, for its real subject - to which history has given a horrid resonance - is a vision of a society seeking a scapegoat for its every failing. The setting is a Berlin department store where the impoverished Plim is hired so that the management can make a show of firing him whenever one of the customers (a line-up of ghastly plutocrats) lodges a complaint. The Chaplinesque Plim screws up and is eventually sacked in earnest before the management realise that he is indispensable. </p> <p>\"Shopworkers can't sing of great emotion, not like at the opera,\" Plim comments - but Spoliansky uses the material to spoof almost every operatic convention going. The store's managers connive in Rossinian patter, Caroline von Recklitz, \"president of the Women's Institute of Spandau\" extols the beauty of an out-of-stock chamber pot with Wagenerian heft. Elida de Coty, a stroppy international vamp, is the coloratura soprano to end coloratura sopranos. It is a delicious score and the Covent Garden festival did it proud with a witty staging by Paul Curran that allowed a number of well-known British singers to send themselves up rotten. Harry Nicoll was a wonderfully nerdy Plim. Frances McCafferty brought the house down as Caroline. Best of the lot was Lilian Watson's Elida, camping it up in a mink coat and spangles and flinging out top Es as if it were the easiest thing in the world. </p> <p>Coupling it with Weill's The Seven Deadly Sins seemed like a good idea, but here things were not so hot. Curran's staging lacked focus. The dancers, Maxine Fone and Andrew George, using their own choreography, indulged in a lot of sub-Kenneth Macmillan erotic grappling when it was not always needed. The BBC Concert Orchestra under Robert Ziegler played it to perfection, but Marie McLaughlin, got up like Joan Crawford, came unstuck in places as Anna, unaccountably so, since she has sung the role in London before and been, in the past, one of its finest interpreters. </p>",

Since banking shares have fallen on the stock market there have been suggestions that the payouts could be worth as little as \u00a3350. But the figure is much lower than the unofficial estimate of \u00a31,000, which was suggested last year. </p> <p>B&amp;B is turning into a bank after members defied the wishes of the board by voting overwhelmingly in favour of carpetbagging plumber Stephen Major's conversion resolution in April 1999. There will be a special meeting of members to approve the plans on July 17 at Sheffield Arena. </p> <p>If all goes ahead as planned, the society will float on the stock market on December 4. For this to happen, at least 75% of savers and 51% of borrowers must vote in favour. </p> <p>Little more than a year ago the society was warning members that if it converted to a bank \"we would be working for the City and our new corporate shareholders instead of working for you\". </p> <p>But the message now is very different. \"Little about Bradford &amp; Bingley and how we deal with customers will change as a result of conversion,\" says the chairman, Lindsay Mackinlay, in the information pack for members. </p> <p>B&amp;B has opted for a flat-rate share distribution scheme whereby every member receives the same windfall, regardless of the size of financial relationship with the society. In all, 2.2m adult savers and 350,000 mortgage customers will benefit, plus 129,000 children and 10,000 trustee account holders. The midpoint between \u00a3647 and \u00a3815 is \u00a3731. </p> <p>However, some observers say there could be a question mark over whether B&amp;B will achieve the estimated market value quoted in the transfer document. Goldman Sachs, the society's adviser, said its estimate of the market capitalisation of the company was based on a theoretical flotation on December 31, 1999. But British banking shares are now 6% lower than at the end of last year. </p> <p>The society acknowledges in the document that there has been \"significant volatility\" in share prices within the retail banking sector since the end of last year. But it goes on to say that nevertheless the board believes there is a \"reasonable likelihood\" that in late April this year, when the transfer document was being put together, B&amp;B would have had a market value within the range given. It also discloses that the cost of flotation is likely to be \u00a368m. </p> <p>The society has been dogged by speculation that it could become the target of a predator or might decide to put itself up for sale. But it said that it had not received any takeover or merger approaches and added that the board had unanimously decided that conversion to a plc was the best way forward. </p> <p>The society has set itself the objective of becoming \"the leading independent national distributor of financial and property services\", with an emphasis on \"choice and independent advice\". It has 630 independent financial advisers and in February it acquired mortgage broker John Charcol.</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than 2.5m members of Bradford &amp; Bingley building society will each receive windfalls estimated at between \u00a3647 and \u00a3815 when the society converts to a bank in December. The figures are contained in the society's transfer document, published yesterday, which puts B&amp;B's estimated market value at between \u00a31.75bn and \u00a32.2bn. The forecasts are higher than some analysts had been predicting in recent months. Since banking shares have fallen on the stock market there have been suggestions that the payouts could be worth as little as \u00a3350. But the figure is much lower than the unofficial estimate of \u00a31,000, which was suggested last year. B&amp;B is turning into a bank after members defied the wishes of the board by voting overwhelmingly in favour of carpetbagging plumber Stephen Major's conversion resolution in April 1999. There will be a special meeting of members to approve the plans on July 17 at Sheffield Arena. If all goes ahead as planned, the society will float on the stock market on December 4. For this to happen, at least 75% of savers and 51% of borrowers must vote in favour. Little more than a year ago the society was warning members that if it converted to a bank \"we would be working for the City and our new corporate shareholders instead of working for you\". But the message now is very different. \"Little about Bradford &amp; Bingley and how we deal with customers will change as a result of conversion,\" says the chairman, Lindsay Mackinlay, in the information pack for members. B&amp;B has opted for a flat-rate share distribution scheme whereby every member receives the same windfall, regardless of the size of financial relationship with the society. In all, 2.2m adult savers and 350,000 mortgage customers will benefit, plus 129,000 children and 10,000 trustee account holders. The midpoint between \u00a3647 and \u00a3815 is \u00a3731. However, some observers say there could be a question mark over whether B&amp;B will achieve the estimated market value quoted in the transfer document. Goldman Sachs, the society's adviser, said its estimate of the market capitalisation of the company was based on a theoretical flotation on December 31, 1999. But British banking shares are now 6% lower than at the end of last year. The society acknowledges in the document that there has been \"significant volatility\" in share prices within the retail banking sector since the end of last year. But it goes on to say that nevertheless the board believes there is a \"reasonable likelihood\" that in late April this year, when the transfer document was being put together, B&amp;B would have had a market value within the range given. It also discloses that the cost of flotation is likely to be \u00a368m. The society has been dogged by speculation that it could become the target of a predator or might decide to put itself up for sale. But it said that it had not received any takeover or merger approaches and added that the board had unanimously decided that conversion to a plc was the best way forward. The society has set itself the objective of becoming \"the leading independent national distributor of financial and property services\", with an emphasis on \"choice and independent advice\". It has 630 independent financial advisers and in February it acquired mortgage broker John Charcol.",

      "bodyText": "Every couple of years the high street banks gently raise the prospect of bringing to an end the concept of \"free banking\" which we enjoy in the UK. Perhaps one of them brings out a premium account with special add-ons like travel insurance and a theatre ticket booking facility in return for an annual or monthly fee. Maybe another introduces an account where you pay a few pounds a month in order drastically to increase your overdraft level, so that the facility is there if you need it. The incentive provided by the bank for the latter is usually that penalties for exceeding your authorised overdraft are likely to be hefty. The aim in both cases is to soften us up for the end of free banking for current accounts in credit. We've always had to pay handsomely for overdraft facilities, even when our average monthly balance is regularly well in the black. But it irks the banks that in the US customers pay for some current accounts, in this country banks feel obliged to offer them for free. So it comes as little surprise that , according to the Consumers' Association report, banks rip off customers by more than \u00a320m a year by failing to clear cheques for up to 11 days. Banks make money from the difference between the savings rate they offer you and the borrowing rate at which they will lend you money. Some of the banks' most popular savings accounts pay measly rates of interest, while research has shown that the most competitive mortgage rates are often from small mutual building societies, rather than the high-street banks. Slowing down the cheque clearing process is just another way to make money out of customers without actually making them pay directly for their current accounts. The growth of internet accounts, with banks competing aggressively for new customers, has so far had little effect on the charges levied by the high street banks. Instead of lowering charges for branch-based customers as well as internet customers, many of the banks have launched new brands instead. This allows them to offer different rates and charges from their high-street products. But as the number of people switching to the internet grows, this anomaly is unlikely to able to continue, and that can only be good news for the consumer.",

He steps up to become co-chief operating of ficer of AOL Time Warner, overseeing all the group's pay-TV channels. Dick Parsons also becomes co-chief operating officer of the company with responsibility for AOL Time Warner's content businesses, including film and television production, music and book publishing. Both Mr Pittman and Mr Parsons will report to AOL Time Warner chief executive Gerald Levin, while Steve Case chairs the group. Also taking a vice-chairmanship alongside Mr Turner is Kenneth Novack, the vice-chairman of AOL. The new structure confirms what many within the Turner-Time Warner group have suspected for a while - that Mr Turner, distracted from the day to day business of his broadcasting empire by his recent divorce from the actor Jane Fonda, is stepping back from the front line. Famous for ruling his news empire with a rod of iron - the staff are banned from smoking because Ms Fonda won Mr Turner over to the anti-tobacco lobby during their nine-year marriage - he has inspired his team of journalists since CNN first launched on July 1, 1980. The network, derided at launch as the \"chicken noodle network\", was the world's first 24-hour news channel when it began and it now reaches 150m homes in 212 countries. Also under Turner's control before the reshuffle were US and international cable networks TBS, TNT and eight different versions of CNN. Since Turner Broadcasting merged with Time Warner in 1996, other networks such as HBO and the Cartoon Network have bolstered the media group's empire. At CNN's celebrations in its home town yesterday, Mr Turner was reluctant to comment on his future at AOL Time Warner. \"I couldn't stay here forever anyway. You get too old or you die.\" Asked what life would be like without CNN, he said: \"There was a time when there was no CNN and Turner was doing OK, so I guess I could live without it again.\" Speculation in Atlanta suggested that AOL Time Warner chief executive Gerald Levin had orchestrated the restructuring to sideline Mr Turner at a time when the new company is desperate to capitalise on its new power in the international media markets.",

      "bodyText": "Fabien Barthez will hold further talks with Manchester United today in the hope of concluding his transfer from Monaco after the two parties failed to reach agreement on a \u00a39.5m move despite 12 hours of negotiations. Initially problems with medical tests seemed to be holding up the transfer but a bigger stumbling block now appears to be personal terms. Barthez and his advisers were expecting to agree a six-year contract worth around \u00a340,000 a week yesterday, but several contract wrangles have yet to be resolved. \"We are still in discussions with both Monaco and the player on several matters,\" United's deputy chief executive Peter Kenyon said last night. United's manager Sir Alex Ferguson had also been keen to complete the deal yesterday, but he is acutely aware, after the breakdown of Ruud van Nistelrooy's transfer from PSV Eindhoven last month, that Barthez suffered a number of injuries for Monaco last season. The 28-year-old had his medical at a private hospital in Cheadle yesterday morning before further tests in the afternoon, with particular emphasis given to an area behind his left knee where he had an operation last October. \"I'm confident we will be given the go-ahead by the doctors to complete this transfer,\" said Ferguson, before leaving for a break to the United States. \u0095 Leeds have appointed Manchester United's former assistant manager Brian Kidd, who was sacked as manager of Blackburn in November, as their director of youth development.",

Turkish fans have also been barred from purchasing any extra tickets for their side's games against Italy, Sweden and Belgium - a legacy of the ugly scenes at the Uefa Cup final in Copenhagen earlier this month. The restrictive decision was taken last week but was made public only as fans, including some who had travelled from England, began queuing to buy tickets. On a day of box-office chaos the tournament organisers struggled to cope with the massive demand for the remaining 48,000 tickets, the majority of which had been returned by foreign football associations. They covered 17 games - including two of the quarter-finals, one of which could involve England - and were to be released from two sales points in Belgium and Holland and via special telephone lines at 9am yesterday. Problems began when the local authority in Brussels refused permission for tickets to be sold from the allocated Belgian sales point at the Vorst-Nationaal arena. \"We found an alternative option in Li\u00e8ge but it would only become operational from next Monday,\" said Jan de Grave, a Euro 2000 spokesman. \"Clearly this caused some problems but we felt it better to let sales go ahead in Holland rather than postpone things.\" \"It was chaos,\" said a local resident John Chapman, one of the fans who arrived at Vorst-Nationaal to find the gates locked. \"There were people milling around not knowing what to do.\" While sales at the second distribution point, in Rotterdam, went more smoothly, chaos reigned on the telephone lines which were overloaded with callers.

      "bodyText": "The managerial plot thickened last night as Celtic and Leicester City battled over the services of Martin O'Neill. Although O'Neill was expected to be confirmed as the Scottish club's new manager yesterday lunchtime, a formal announcement - and accompanying press conference - was cancelled when the unpredictable Irishman had second thoughts about becoming Celtic's fifth manager in as many years. Despite O'Neill's feelings of loyalty to Leicester, it is likely he will join the club he has supported since childhood, quite possibly in the next 24 hours. Celtic faced ending yesterday with egg-covered faces after O'Neill - true to form - began to doubt the wisdom of a decision he had reached late on Monday night after all manner of soul-searching. Celtic did not confirm reports of O'Neill's imminent installation as successor to John Barnes, even though the normally circumspect Press Association announced at 9.58am that he had definitely agreed to move north of the border. However, inside two hours it became clear O'Neill's mind was not made up. He entered further negotiations with the persuasive Leicester chairman John Elsom. As Celtic hinted at damage-limitation, speculation mounted that O'Neill was about to confirm he would honour the remaining years of his Leicester contract. But it is believed O'Neill emerged from his meeting with Elsom late yesterday afternoon and headed for London to reopen talks with understandably confused Celtic officials. This is not the first time O'Neill has moved to the brink of accepting one of football's top jobs only to have a dramatic, last-minute change of heart. Two years ago he nearly moved to Everton after Howard Kendall's third spell in charge at the Merseyside club ended in failure. A few months later O'Neill looked certain to leave for Leeds only to reconsider at the eleventh hour. One thing is certain. If he again snubs a major club, in this case Celtic, O'Neill risks being overlooked the next time an inviting managerial post is up for grabs. Yesterday's developments will have been closely monitored - indeed, probably welcomed - by the former Wimbledon manager Joe Kinnear. Kinnear had been expected to inform Sheffield Wednesday yesterday whether he would succeed Danny Wilson but, predictably, he asked for yet more time to consider. Although anxious to return to management after a 14-month break, Kinnear has grave reservations about joining a club which has not only surrendered Premiership status but is \u00a312m in debt.",

An enquiry commissioned by the Russell group of 19 top universities says fees should rise from \u00a31,025 to \u00a36,000 for science students and \u00a34,000 for arts students. The universities, encouraged by Andrew Adonis, education adviser in the Number 10 policy unit, believe so-called top-up fees would enable research to reach or maintain a world-class level and improve pay levels for academics. Poorer studetns would not have to pay but instead recieve bursaries through a more developed scholarship system - the kind which will help pay for Tyneside sixth-former Laura Spence's place at Harvard. David Blunkett, the education secretary, is opposed to top-up fees. One of the contributors to the report, Andrew Oswald from Warwick, said the report would present the \"strong moral case\" for top-up fees. \"Why exactly should Britain's plumbers and secretaries and telephone operators have to pay for you to go to Warwick?\" he wrote in the university's student magazine. \"You will earn far more than them.\"",

      "body": "<p> Oxford has this week taken a beating over the case of an able and well qualified young woman from a state school who was unable to secure a place here to read medicine. Sadly, this happens every year in every UK university both to students from state schools and those from the private sector. So the puzzle is what the fuss is about. You don't have to be a university teacher to see that you can't draw generalisations about a system from a single instance and it is a bit worrying that you can apparently be chancellor of the exchequer and do so. </p> <p>I write as an Oxford tutor of some 40 years who came from a working class background in the north midlands and who has spent his life seeking to persuade similar children to apply here. When I came here not all my colleagues seemed to enthusiastically endorse that (though most did). Today if there are closet class warriors fighting for privilege and class, they are very closet indeed, and I don't see them. When I first came, children of average ability in the private sector applied to Oxford as a matter of course and children of blindingly wonderful brilliance stayed away because they thought we would not take them. It was a national tragedy, and all my life here Oxford has sought to counter this false impression. What is puzzling is that the government knows this as well as anyone and yet this week's events will make our shared goals the harder to achieve, unless the nonsense is rebutted. Oxford's failure has been to dispel that prejudice, just as the Labour party failed for 18 years in the middle of my life to persuade the nation of the error of its prejudices. </p> <p>Choosing students with the potential to do well at university is a seriously difficult task. There is no educational level playing field in the 5-18 year age range in the UK. In this respect we are different from most other comparable nations. Some children will have attended schools where the unit of resource per child is many times that of others. Many private sector students will have been taught in schools in excellent condition, in small classes, with excellent libraries, and will have had coaching for university entrance. Many state school students will have attended schools, parts of which are in serious disrepair, in large groups and which are held together only by the dynamism and generosity of spirit of school teachers who do more for their students than anyone has a right to expect. University admissions officers are then supposed to be able to tell which are the students with the most potential. Every year we are challenged by school colleagues in both sectors who detect, in our efforts to discount the advantages of some and compensate for the disadvantages of others, a bias one way or the other. Picking a Cabinet must be child's play by comparison, but no doubt occasionally the odd former state school student still fails to get in. </p> <p>Sending children to private schools is neither illegal, nor even immoral it seems, judging from the behaviour of the great and the good. The parents presumably imagine some educational benefit will follow. Attacking university admissions tutors is a good diversionary tactic and it is certainly a lot cheaper than putting the kind of money into state schools which would give all our children true equality of opportunity. Until there is a government funding or regulation to ensure that all our students have access to similar educational resources, all this fuss on the part of government looks like diversionary tactics and makes the tasks of admissions tutors unnecessarily hard. Meanwhile we cannot discriminate in favour of private school students nor favour state school: all we can do is seek to identify the factors which account for the admissions evidence before us. This is a serious equality of treatment issue and it has human rights, if not Human Rights, implications; and litigation from either group is always a possibility. </p> <p>Oxford has two reasons for wanting to get that right, both, if you like, selfish. First, and in the national interest, is the need to have first class universities, of which we hope we are one. Our life blood depends on it and first class students are part of that aim. Second, the tutorial system here, involving near solitary confinement with students over prolonged periods, is a disproportionate penalty for tutors who make mistakes at admission time.

      "bodyText": "Oxford has this week taken a beating over the case of an able and well qualified young woman from a state school who was unable to secure a place here to read medicine. Sadly, this happens every year in every UK university both to students from state schools and those from the private sector. So the puzzle is what the fuss is about. You don't have to be a university teacher to see that you can't draw generalisations about a system from a single instance and it is a bit worrying that you can apparently be chancellor of the exchequer and do so. I write as an Oxford tutor of some 40 years who came from a working class background in the north midlands and who has spent his life seeking to persuade similar children to apply here. When I came here not all my colleagues seemed to enthusiastically endorse that (though most did). Today if there are closet class warriors fighting for privilege and class, they are very closet indeed, and I don't see them. When I first came, children of average ability in the private sector applied to Oxford as a matter of course and children of blindingly wonderful brilliance stayed away because they thought we would not take them. It was a national tragedy, and all my life here Oxford has sought to counter this false impression. What is puzzling is that the government knows this as well as anyone and yet this week's events will make our shared goals the harder to achieve, unless the nonsense is rebutted. Oxford's failure has been to dispel that prejudice, just as the Labour party failed for 18 years in the middle of my life to persuade the nation of the error of its prejudices. Choosing students with the potential to do well at university is a seriously difficult task. There is no educational level playing field in the 5-18 year age range in the UK. In this respect we are different from most other comparable nations. Some children will have attended schools where the unit of resource per child is many times that of others. Many private sector students will have been taught in schools in excellent condition, in small classes, with excellent libraries, and will have had coaching for university entrance. Many state school students will have attended schools, parts of which are in serious disrepair, in large groups and which are held together only by the dynamism and generosity of spirit of school teachers who do more for their students than anyone has a right to expect. University admissions officers are then supposed to be able to tell which are the students with the most potential. Every year we are challenged by school colleagues in both sectors who detect, in our efforts to discount the advantages of some and compensate for the disadvantages of others, a bias one way or the other. Picking a Cabinet must be child's play by comparison, but no doubt occasionally the odd former state school student still fails to get in. Sending children to private schools is neither illegal, nor even immoral it seems, judging from the behaviour of the great and the good. The parents presumably imagine some educational benefit will follow. Attacking university admissions tutors is a good diversionary tactic and it is certainly a lot cheaper than putting the kind of money into state schools which would give all our children true equality of opportunity. Until there is a government funding or regulation to ensure that all our students have access to similar educational resources, all this fuss on the part of government looks like diversionary tactics and makes the tasks of admissions tutors unnecessarily hard. Meanwhile we cannot discriminate in favour of private school students nor favour state school: all we can do is seek to identify the factors which account for the admissions evidence before us. This is a serious equality of treatment issue and it has human rights, if not Human Rights, implications; and litigation from either group is always a possibility. Oxford has two reasons for wanting to get that right, both, if you like, selfish. First, and in the national interest, is the need to have first class universities, of which we hope we are one. Our life blood depends on it and first class students are part of that aim. Second, the tutorial system here, involving near solitary confinement with students over prolonged periods, is a disproportionate penalty for tutors who make mistakes at admission time. Tutorials work only with good students and every tutor who admits students knows that. The consequences of failure constitute cruel and unusual punishment. We none of us claim to be infallible, but self interest alone would persuade any Oxford tutor who was not otherwise convinced by ordinary principles of justice. We must continue to say that what we say is what we believe: we are looking to select the best students who apply to us and hope that one day we will be believed. We spend a lot of money on saying that at present. We must continue with schemes which familarise socially disadvantaged students with our particular demands. My own college has a majority of state school students but the aim here, as elsewhere, is social integration. Turning private school children into pariahs is as abhorrent to the Fellows as it is to the students. But until government is willing to put more money into state schools so that admissions exercises are not wholly attempts to make compensations for the present injustices, we fight with one arm tied behind our backs. Sloganising is, however, much easier than finding the political courage to raise the resources to produce a truly level playing field for our nation's children.",

Calm down, there's not long to wait.</p> <p><strong>ADVERTISEMENT</strong></p> <p>Take a trip to the \"Pitch\" chatroom at <a href=\"http://www.breathe.com\">www.breathe.com</a> for a Euro2000 warm up.</p> <p>Mobile Internet on any network. it's amazing what happens when you breathe</p> <p><strong>TRANSFER BABYLON (AND ON)</strong></p> <p>Not so long ago, a transfer was a transfer. One minute Eric Cantona was sitting on the bench scowling at Howard Wilkinson, the next he was at Old Trafford playing one-twos with Brian McClair. Neither did anyone anticipate David Speedie leaving Coventry for Liverpool. Although there may have been a reason for that. But as the Fiver dutifully brings you the latest-minute developments in the proposed transfers of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Fabien Barthez, we can't help but pine for the good old days.</p> <p>First to Hasselbaink. Jimmy's \u00a314m move to Chelsea's of Chelsea appears to be a goer again after Atletico Madrid's vice-president Miguel Angel Gil (he's the son of Jesus you know) claimed the deal was done and dusted this morning. \"All that remains is for the clubs to exchange faxes and for the signing to be ratified by the English Premier League,\" he said. Which would lead you to believe that a transfer might just be in the offing. Until, that is, you realise that Chelsea have said nothing on the matter at all, and that the Dutchman has yet to set foot in this country.</p> <p>At least Barthez put himself up in a charming Cheshire hotel while jumping through the Lord Imperial Ferg's many transfer hoops. Last night, sleep-inducing reports suggested that the deal had foundered over the slaphead-happy keeper's wage demands. Reports this morning caused even greater narcolepsy by suggesting the move was back on, and then United barely managed to raise an eyelid by announcing a press conference for 4pm. Probably to announce that they'll be announcing another conference some time next... what's that? United have signed the French international keeper? For \u00a37.8m? On a six-year contract? They could at least have given us a hint.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"To be honest, I don't give a damn what he says. And neither does anybody else because he is wrong\" - That'd be Ken Bates then. Villa midfielder Ian Taylor gives the Chelsea chairman a piece of his mind.</p> <p><strong>POSH PAUSE</strong></p> <p>Last night, Peterborough manager Barry Fry met up with the board of his newly-promoted club to make plans for the future. But soon after, the excitable little cockney left London Road in high dudgeon and with low spirits. \"I've been booted out of Peterborough and I'm totally gutted,\" the red-faced little roly-pollster ranted, his voice barely audible above the jets of steam coming out of his ears. \"I don't know if I will ever get over it. I've had many disappointments in football but none as bad as this.\"</p> <p>News sad enough to stir feelings of sympathy in any man... if it wasn't for the fact that, according to Peterborough chairman Peter Boizot, Fry hasn't actually been sacked. According to Boizot, Fry \"raised an issue about youth players. We wanted to see two or three youth players playing pretty regularly in the reserves. It caused him to get a little bit heated.\" Fry? Heated?</p> <p>\"I can't really say we had an argument,\" the Posh chairman continued unconvincingly. \"I think he got worked up and he eventually decided to close his briefcase and walk out of the door.\" Considering Fry is not known for keeping things totally in perspective, and that this sort of thing used to happen every two minutes when he was at Barnet, the Fiver fully expects all this to be forgotten once the dust settles. And we're sure Boizot agrees. \"As far as the directors are concerned, the door is open and he can still walk back.\" You see? \"But I would expect [Fry] to come back with some sort of apology.\" Oh.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Chelsea have made a late attempt to sign Marseille winger Robert Pires, who has been expected to complete a \u00a36.25m deal with Arsenal.</p> <p>Spurs have begun talks with \u00a33m Lens forward Pascal Nouma. The 27-year-old striker wants to play in the Premiership and the prospect of reuniting with David Ginola, who played with Nouma at PSG, may swing the balance.</p> <p>Australian international captain Paul Okon is expected to sign a four-year deal at Middlesbrough later this week. The Fiorentina midfielder will cost nothing - the deal is dependent on a medical.</p> <p>Chelsea are tracking 29-year-old Nigerian winger Finidi George, who would cost a bargain \u00a33.5m from demoted Real Betis.</p> <p>Leeds defender Michael Duberry is a target for Southampton.</p> <p>Trevor Sinclair will be at the top of Martin O'Neill's shopping list should the Leicester manager leave for Celtic. The West Ham utility man is valued at \u00a38m.</p> <p>Manchester City and Bradford are both interested in signing Craig Hignett. They are willing to pay up to \u00a32m for the Barnsley star.</p> <p>Newcastle full-back Didier Domi has expressed an interest in returning to his former club Paris St Germain.</p> <p>Bolton could snatch Hearts defender Paul Ritchie from under the noses of Rangers. Ritchie, who played for Bolton on loan last season and becomes a free agent at the end of June, has not yet been offered a contract by the Scottish champions. \"We're speaking to his agent and, if what I've heard is true, then we're in his hands,\" Bolton manager Sam Allardyce said today.</p> <p>Paris St Germain are interested in Davor Suker. West Ham remain favourites as the player wants to stay in London.</p> <p>Reading have bid \u00a3400,000 for Henrik Lykke, centre-back for Danish champions Herfolge.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Joe Kinnear has turned down the offer to become Sheffield Wednesday manager, according to his agent.</p> <p>Reports in today's press suggest that cable giant NTL have outbid BSkyB for the core package of Premiership TV rights.

Mobile Internet on any network. it's amazing what happens when you breathe TRANSFER BABYLON (AND ON) Not so long ago, a transfer was a transfer. One minute Eric Cantona was sitting on the bench scowling at Howard Wilkinson, the next he was at Old Trafford playing one-twos with Brian McClair. Neither did anyone anticipate David Speedie leaving Coventry for Liverpool. Although there may have been a reason for that. But as the Fiver dutifully brings you the latest-minute developments in the proposed transfers of Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Fabien Barthez, we can't help but pine for the good old days. First to Hasselbaink. Jimmy's \u00a314m move to Chelsea's of Chelsea appears to be a goer again after Atletico Madrid's vice-president Miguel Angel Gil (he's the son of Jesus you know) claimed the deal was done and dusted this morning. \"All that remains is for the clubs to exchange faxes and for the signing to be ratified by the English Premier League,\" he said. Which would lead you to believe that a transfer might just be in the offing. Until, that is, you realise that Chelsea have said nothing on the matter at all, and that the Dutchman has yet to set foot in this country. At least Barthez put himself up in a charming Cheshire hotel while jumping through the Lord Imperial Ferg's many transfer hoops. Last night, sleep-inducing reports suggested that the deal had foundered over the slaphead-happy keeper's wage demands. Reports this morning caused even greater narcolepsy by suggesting the move was back on, and then United barely managed to raise an eyelid by announcing a press conference for 4pm. Probably to announce that they'll be announcing another conference some time next... what's that? United have signed the French international keeper? For \u00a37.8m? On a six-year contract? They could at least have given us a hint. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"To be honest, I don't give a damn what he says. And neither does anybody else because he is wrong\" - That'd be Ken Bates then. Villa midfielder Ian Taylor gives the Chelsea chairman a piece of his mind. POSH PAUSE Last night, Peterborough manager Barry Fry met up with the board of his newly-promoted club to make plans for the future. But soon after, the excitable little cockney left London Road in high dudgeon and with low spirits. \"I've been booted out of Peterborough and I'm totally gutted,\" the red-faced little roly-pollster ranted, his voice barely audible above the jets of steam coming out of his ears. \"I don't know if I will ever get over it. I've had many disappointments in football but none as bad as this.\" News sad enough to stir feelings of sympathy in any man... if it wasn't for the fact that, according to Peterborough chairman Peter Boizot, Fry hasn't actually been sacked. According to Boizot, Fry \"raised an issue about youth players. We wanted to see two or three youth players playing pretty regularly in the reserves. It caused him to get a little bit heated.\" Fry? Heated? \"I can't really say we had an argument,\" the Posh chairman continued unconvincingly. \"I think he got worked up and he eventually decided to close his briefcase and walk out of the door.\" Considering Fry is not known for keeping things totally in perspective, and that this sort of thing used to happen every two minutes when he was at Barnet, the Fiver fully expects all this to be forgotten once the dust settles. And we're sure Boizot agrees. \"As far as the directors are concerned, the door is open and he can still walk back.\" You see? \"But I would expect [Fry] to come back with some sort of apology.\" Oh. THE RUMOUR MILL Chelsea have made a late attempt to sign Marseille winger Robert Pires, who has been expected to complete a \u00a36.25m deal with Arsenal. Spurs have begun talks with \u00a33m Lens forward Pascal Nouma. The 27-year-old striker wants to play in the Premiership and the prospect of reuniting with David Ginola, who played with Nouma at PSG, may swing the balance. Australian international captain Paul Okon is expected to sign a four-year deal at Middlesbrough later this week. The Fiorentina midfielder will cost nothing - the deal is dependent on a medical. Chelsea are tracking 29-year-old Nigerian winger Finidi George, who would cost a bargain \u00a33.5m from demoted Real Betis. Leeds defender Michael Duberry is a target for Southampton. Trevor Sinclair will be at the top of Martin O'Neill's shopping list should the Leicester manager leave for Celtic. The West Ham utility man is valued at \u00a38m. Manchester City and Bradford are both interested in signing Craig Hignett. They are willing to pay up to \u00a32m for the Barnsley star. Newcastle full-back Didier Domi has expressed an interest in returning to his former club Paris St Germain. Bolton could snatch Hearts defender Paul Ritchie from under the noses of Rangers. Ritchie, who played for Bolton on loan last season and becomes a free agent at the end of June, has not yet been offered a contract by the Scottish champions. \"We're speaking to his agent and, if what I've heard is true, then we're in his hands,\" Bolton manager Sam Allardyce said today. Paris St Germain are interested in Davor Suker. West Ham remain favourites as the player wants to stay in London. Reading have bid \u00a3400,000 for Henrik Lykke, centre-back for Danish champions Herfolge. NEWS IN BRIEF Joe Kinnear has turned down the offer to become Sheffield Wednesday manager, according to his agent. Reports in today's press suggest that cable giant NTL have outbid BSkyB for the core package of Premiership TV rights. NTL are believed to have offered the Premier League \u00a31.25bn for 66 live games and 40 pay-per-view games in the bidding for the new contract which begins in August 2001. QPR have signed Wrexham striker Karl Connolly on a free transfer. The 29-year-old, who played more then 350 league games for Wrexham, has agreed to a three-year contract. Preston are to issues shares in an attempt to raise up to \u00a37.5m to go towards re-development of the ground and strengthening the squad. Ayr have bought Hibernian defender Michael Renwick.

But the current media interest in their troubled marriage highlights a familiar pattern, not just in the world of the rich and famous, but for the rest of us, too. For Patsy and Liam's three-year marriage is reportedly on the rocks just eight months after the birth of their son, Lennon. </p> <p>The whys and wherefores of any couple's marriage, or its failure, remain essentially a mystery to outsiders, but it doesn't take a Mori poll to tell us that relationships frequently founder soon after the arrival of a child. Babies, you see, can break up your marriage much more effectively than they can glue it together. Because, as most new parents will tell you, having a baby is like the explosion of a neutron bomb - it leaves buildings standing but destroys life as we know it. </p> <p>Sarah, an interior designer, had been married to Paul, a lecturer, for three years when baby Daniel arrived. They were both delighted, but just months later their already fragile relationship was failing. \"Your social life comes to an abrupt halt,\" says Sarah, who separated from her husband when Daniel was a year old. \"Your routine is completely out the window. Then there are the sleepless nights - you haven't got the energy to deal with the demands of the day. Often the woman's role changes more dramatically than the man's. Men usually continue their jobs, women are at home looking after the baby. A lot of jealousy creeps in on both sides. </p> <p>\"That was a big factor for us. I found it difficult because he didn't change his lifestyle. He was still going out, and playing sport five nights a week. I got very angry and used to go out anyway, taking the baby. And Paul didn't cope well with the sleepless nights. It was creating arguments between us, and our relationship was pretty rocky anyway. With well-established relationships which have a firm foundation, and where you've talked things through beforehand, a new baby might test it for a while, but I don't think it's going to break it. For us, it was going to happen anyway.\" </p> <p>You can read all the books you like, you can go to every NCT class in the area, but most couples are utterly unprepared for the impact of a baby, says author and Relate counsellor Julia Cole. \"Until you've got the baby in your arms, it's very difficult to know how it's going to affect you. Babies are such hard work. </p> <p>\"Studies have shown that if the couple do not communicate well or have problems negotiating, the baby will reinforce those problems. Because both parents have to give so much time to the child, all that other stuff that used to support the couple - affection, sex, looking after the home, work - often goes by the board. Gradually, the couple start to say, 'Can we really sustain this?'\" For even the most contented of couples, the dramatic change in dynamics is difficult to navigate. Often the baby becomes the sole focus of the mother's attention, leaving the father feeling excluded and redundant, says Denise Knowles, Relate counsellor and sex therapist. </p> <p>And with the growing phenomenon of the so-called new dad, who wants to be as committed and actively involved as any mother, it gets even more complicated: \"Nowadays we are seeing more babies being the focus of both mum and dad to the detriment of the relationship. They become so absorbed in the baby, they don't get out. They become inward-looking and suddenly they realise they haven't got a life together.\" </p> <p>Throw work into the equation, and it piles on even more pressure. You're parents, you're both working and your idea of yourselves as a couple becomes remote. There's the emotional burden, the financial burden and then there's the sex. Doctors tell you it's all right six weeks after the birth - new dad will have it pencilled in the diary; new mum may have quite a different idea. </p> <p>There is also interesting American research which suggests that women are much faster at getting to grips with parenting than men, which again may cause conflict. According to the 1992 study, women are often dissatisfied with themselves around six months after the birth of the child - they are wondering if they can cope, they may feel exhausted and unattractive. After that their satisfaction shoots up as they bond with their baby and their confidence in their parenting ability grows. Men's feelings of uncertainty drag on a lot longer; their lowest point of self-esteem comes 18 months after the birth of the child. </p> <p>\"It's about learning to be a parent,\" says Julia Cole. \"Women tend to latch on to it more quickly and feel more confident about it more quickly. Men appear to struggle for longer.\" The imbalance leads to doubts about whether the relationship is right. </p> <p>The baby itself may be an attempt to patch the relationship together, the so-called superglue baby which bonds mother and father. \"It's that feeling - we will have to make the relationship work if we have a baby. But people factor out all the stress the child causes in the early years.\" </p> <p>Sometimes the difficulties start even before the baby has been born. Cole has counselled couples whose relationship is teetering on the brink of collapse simply because the woman is pregnant. \"Often it's about expectations and anxiety - will you be able to manage? Sometimes it's because the pregnancy was unexpected, or because of difficulties with your own past. Maybe your experience of being with your family was not very good. You're worried and ask, 'Am I going to be a good parent?'\" </p> <p>So how does anyone ever survive it? \"The most important thing that really helps couples is to have support from family and friends,\" says Cole. \"People who will babysit, people who will help with housework, people you can call for advice when the baby is crying at three in the morning. That network of friendship and family affection is probably the most crucial thing you can have.\"</p>",

There is also interesting American research which suggests that women are much faster at getting to grips with parenting than men, which again may cause conflict. According to the 1992 study, women are often dissatisfied with themselves around six months after the birth of the child - they are wondering if they can cope, they may feel exhausted and unattractive. After that their satisfaction shoots up as they bond with their baby and their confidence in their parenting ability grows. Men's feelings of uncertainty drag on a lot longer; their lowest point of self-esteem comes 18 months after the birth of the child. \"It's about learning to be a parent,\" says Julia Cole. \"Women tend to latch on to it more quickly and feel more confident about it more quickly. Men appear to struggle for longer.\" The imbalance leads to doubts about whether the relationship is right. The baby itself may be an attempt to patch the relationship together, the so-called superglue baby which bonds mother and father. \"It's that feeling - we will have to make the relationship work if we have a baby. But people factor out all the stress the child causes in the early years.\" Sometimes the difficulties start even before the baby has been born. Cole has counselled couples whose relationship is teetering on the brink of collapse simply because the woman is pregnant. \"Often it's about expectations and anxiety - will you be able to manage? Sometimes it's because the pregnancy was unexpected, or because of difficulties with your own past. Maybe your experience of being with your family was not very good. You're worried and ask, 'Am I going to be a good parent?'\" So how does anyone ever survive it? \"The most important thing that really helps couples is to have support from family and friends,\" says Cole. \"People who will babysit, people who will help with housework, people you can call for advice when the baby is crying at three in the morning. That network of friendship and family affection is probably the most crucial thing you can have.\"",

During the course of the evening, she tries to rearrange the furniture, socially engineer the group by dragging guests across the room to talk to one another, and supervise the catering by planting herself in the kitchen and issuing orders through that well-known medium of control, petulance power: \"Why are you doing that? Why? Why?

Out of the 100 teachers questioned, the majority believed that future leaders could be picked out from a class of five-year-old children. One in five thought that leadership skills should be fostered in children from the age of three. And the signs of a good leader were almost universally identified to be confidence and sociability, observations that have left the institute nervous about the way in which quiet children are being unfairly classified as undynamic. </p> <p>The idea that one can make forecasts about a child's future based on the way they act in nursery school is a hazardous one. If you can pick out the leaders, then why not the losers and the serial killers? Why not decode Milly and Johnny's tussle in the sandpit as evidence of their suitability as rival captains of industry? Or Billy's reluctance to join in pinning the tail on the donkey as an indication that he'll grow up to be a creepy loner? After all, Harold Wilson was pictured as a child outside Downing Street with scary prescience for his future calling. </p> <p>The problem is that the characteristics commonly thought to denote flair for leadership can be based upon false assumptions, first among them that children who are loud and bossy are acting with a level of self- consciousness that gives their behaviour any meaning. \"Children from the ages of three to five rarely have what we would call 'theory of mind',\" says Iram Siraj-Blatchford, professor of early childhood education at the Institute of Education. \"This means an ability to take in other people's perspectives, which can be vital for leadership. Girls are more sociable at that age than boys and we could end up concluding that girls are going to make better leaders than boys. That is a ridiculous assertion.\" </p> <p>She and colleagues from the universities of Cardiff and Oxford are engaged in a six-year study into the behaviour of 4,000 children between the ages of three and seven. \"Naturally, if young children are confident they're going to be fairly bossy and assertive,\" she says. \"That isn't necessarily leadership. I run a department, and a lot of it is based on staying quiet about what I think, problem-solving in the background and making other people feel good about the results we come up with.\" </p> <p>In children, this can manifest itself in a strong disposition to learn, an ability to concentrate and persevere with a task in the face of failure, and an ability to ask questions, none of which need involve the more conventional displays of leadership. \"I'm not sure the answer is about dominance,\" says Dr Glyn Collis, lecturer in psychology at Warwick University. \"As a good leader, you need to be able to tune into the needs of the people you are going to lead, get them on your side - not to be bossy.\" </p> <p>Dr Collis questions the value of even trying to base predictions of a child's future persuasions on their early behaviour. A five-year-old displaying what might be seen as leadership qualities can only be viewed as successful within the limited context of the nursery environment. \"I suspect that what the teachers were responding to is an ability to identify children of five who are good leaders in the environment they're in at that time. It doesn't stand to reason that they'll be good leaders later on. To my knowledge, there is no evidence that you could identify leadership qualities in a five-year-old.\" </p> <p>This is partly because the criteria for a \"successful\" child changes between junior and senior school. In junior school, the chatty, sociable child is frequently thought of by teachers to be the most engaged and potentially successful in the class. By the time they have reached secondary school, that has inverted: the talkative child is the potentially disruptive one; the studious child, the one who might be tipped for future glory. </p> <p>\"In the secondary environment, the more introspective child is able to focus better and present himself as a better independent learner,\" says Dr John Acklaw, chartered educational psychologist and former president of the Association of Educational Psychologists. \"In primary school, the sociable child tends to stand out more. Sociability might be an aspect of leadership, but it isn't a necessary condition of it.\" </p> <p> Lest it be read as an advert for pre-determinism, the most important factor in this research is identified as a child's environment. Psychologists agree that, while children as young as three can show dispositions towards certain personality types, they are influenced less by innate ability than parental behaviour. \"We know that a child who experiences limit setting, and affection from a parent in strong doses, is someone who is well-adjusted and likely to be regarded as worth following by peers,\" says Dr Howard Steele, a psychologist at University College, London. \"The home background makes a difference,\" says Prof Iram Siraj-Blatchford. \"The amount of time parents spend reading, taking them to the library, is important. Children develop so rapidly that to identify something in them at the age of five is to solidify them in time.\" </p> <p>The report concludes that the trick is to nurture the leader in every child, to approach leadership not as a showy, starry prize for the gobby kids in the class, but as a state of basic security for them all. \"The people who rise to prominence within organisations are not always prominent early on,\" reminds Dr Steele. \"Every leader needs to be mentored.\"</p>",

Hanno Hath prefers to read rather than study for the annual examination, his wife Ira is a prophetess and the twins, Bowman and Kestrel, are frustrated by living under a strict regime. </p> <p>When Kestrel finally flips, the hand of authority comes down heavily, so the twins, together with smelly outcast Mumpo, set off on a dangerous journey to the mountains in order to find the Wind Singer which has the power to liberate their homeland. </p> <p>Nicholson spins a cracking yarn, creating an exceptionally moving fantasy novel that is potent but never preachy as it subtly suggests that achievement without love and kindness is a prison. </p> <p> <strong> How to buy the books</strong> </p> <p> Off the Shelf is a monthly selection of the best new titles. It can be used in conjunction with the Guardian website (<a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.\">www.booksunlimited.co.</a> uk) where you will find reviews of classic books that will form the backbone to a child's library. All the books can be bought direct from the website. The titles below can also be bought through Guardian Culture-Shop, at the discount indicated: freephone 0800 3166 102, or send a cheque payable to the Guardian cultureShop to 250 Western Ave, London W3 6EE. </p> <p> <strong> I Will Not Ever Never Eat a Tomato</strong> </p> <p>by Lauren Child (Orchard, \u00a310.99; CultureShop price \u00a38.99 + 99p&amp;p) </p> <p> From the screwy title onwards, everything is different about Lauren Child's book. Charlie plays a trick on his little sister Lola, possibly the faddiest eater in the universe. Carrots become twiglets from Jupiter, peas are green drops from Greenland and boring old mash potato is \"cloud fluff from the pointiest peak of Mount Fuji\". </p> <p>Needless to say Lola is soon gobbling it all down, and so will you and your offspring be drawn in by the off-the-wall visuals that mix line drawings and patterns with photographs, creating a world that is absolutely grounded in reality yet also wildly imaginative. </p> <p> <strong> Weslandia</strong> </p> <p>by Paul Fleichman, illustrated by Kevin Hawkes (Walker, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a34.99 freepost) </p> <p> One of the first things you notice when your child starts school is how quickly the most individual of children turn into conformists. It passes, but Paul Fleischman's tale may help the phase pass quicker. </p> <p>Wesley is an outcast from the civilisation around him in suburban America, the only kid in town who doesn't like pizza and fizzy drinks.

      "bodyText": "Book of the month The Wind Singer by William Nicholson (Mammoth, \u00a312.99) Anyone who has queried the point of baseline assessments, Sats tests and league tables will take heart from this innovative and subversive novel for the over nines. In the cheerless world of Aramanth, a supposedly perfect society where everyone has a personal rating that they must strive to improve, the Hath family are oddballs. Hanno Hath prefers to read rather than study for the annual examination, his wife Ira is a prophetess and the twins, Bowman and Kestrel, are frustrated by living under a strict regime. When Kestrel finally flips, the hand of authority comes down heavily, so the twins, together with smelly outcast Mumpo, set off on a dangerous journey to the mountains in order to find the Wind Singer which has the power to liberate their homeland. Nicholson spins a cracking yarn, creating an exceptionally moving fantasy novel that is potent but never preachy as it subtly suggests that achievement without love and kindness is a prison. How to buy the books Off the Shelf is a monthly selection of the best new titles.

I Will Not Ever Never Eat a Tomato by Lauren Child (Orchard, \u00a310.99; CultureShop price \u00a38.99 + 99p&amp;p) From the screwy title onwards, everything is different about Lauren Child's book. Charlie plays a trick on his little sister Lola, possibly the faddiest eater in the universe. Carrots become twiglets from Jupiter, peas are green drops from Greenland and boring old mash potato is \"cloud fluff from the pointiest peak of Mount Fuji\". Needless to say Lola is soon gobbling it all down, and so will you and your offspring be drawn in by the off-the-wall visuals that mix line drawings and patterns with photographs, creating a world that is absolutely grounded in reality yet also wildly imaginative. Weslandia by Paul Fleichman, illustrated by Kevin Hawkes (Walker, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a34.99 freepost) One of the first things you notice when your child starts school is how quickly the most individual of children turn into conformists. It passes, but Paul Fleischman's tale may help the phase pass quicker. Wesley is an outcast from the civilisation around him in suburban America, the only kid in town who doesn't like pizza and fizzy drinks. With the help of some seeds blown on the wind, he has founded his own civilisation in the back garden. This wonderfully satirical book has a sinister twist at the end that reminds you how quickly even difference can be assimilated to become the norm. Marianne Dreams by Catherine Storr (Faber &amp; Faber, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a34.99 free-post) A long-overdue reissue of this extraordinary book, a densely psychological portrait of a child's anger, frustration and jealousy. Marianne, confined to bed with a long-term illness, finds a pencil with which she draws a house, a garden and a small boy at the window. At night she dreams she is transported into her drawing. The writing is remarkable in the way it captures the anger that makes the powerless Marianne want to obliterate the world by scribbling it out. A psychologist would have a field day, but children will recognise the truth with which it deals with the feelings of rage and fear. Mercy's Birds by Linda Holeman (Floris, \u00a34.99; CultureShop price \u00a34.99 freepost) Mercy is 15 and coping with school, a mother who is falling apart, an evening job and the return of her aunt's sexually predatory boyfriend. This could be a depressing read, but Mercy is such a mixture of steel and frailty that you will her to survive. There is a horribly truthful scene in the hospital emergency room where Mercy tells her mother, who has just overdosed, how much she hates her. Like the snow that falls on the town where this novel takes place, this is a convincing portrait of a life that is snowbound by circumstance, fear and misplaced independence. And eventually Mercy does find her place in the sun. Mabel Dancing by Amy Hest, illustrated by Christine Davenier (Walker, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99 + 99p&amp;p) This is the simplest of stories about a little girl, Mabel, who is put to bed on the night of her parents' shindig but who then watches what happens through the banisters. The sounds enchant, brought alive by the rhythm of the text and the swooshing physicality of the drawings. Initially I had some resistance to this book, largely because it evokes a world of big houses and grand black-tie parties that seems so ridiculous. But after several bedtime sessions that ended in us prancing around the room, I concluded that any book that is so tactile and so makes its readers want to dance, has a lot going for it. How the Whale Became and Other Stories by Ted Hughes, illustrated by Jackie Morris (Faber and Faber, \u00a317.99; CultureShop price \u00a314.99 + 99p&amp;p) Did you know that tortoises always used to come first in any race, cats are great violinists, the hare believes that the moon wants to marry him and that it took a while for the elephant to learn to be itself? Ted Hughes's inventive creation fables, sometimes sly and humorous and sometimes lyrical, were first published in 1963. But they have never been seen like this before. This exquisite new edition provides illustrations whose rich, grave, muted, almost medieval beauty are in perfect harmony with the deceptive simplicity of the words. The Memory Prisoner by Thomas Bloor (Hodder, \u00a33.99; CultureShop price \u00a33.99 freepost) Maddie is 15. She hasn't left the house for 12 years since the day her granddad went missing after something nasty happened at the town library. Thomas Bloor's first novel appears to begin in serious vein, but gradually spirals into a bizarrely comic account of a town where everything official from the post to medical records have been taken over by the local library, which hasn't lent a book to anyone for more than a decade. There are some touches, such as the three librarians sold into slavery by the dad who has done a moonlight flit to Las Vegas, that make up for the inconsistency of tone. Burger Wuss by Matthew T Anderson (Walker, \u00a39.99; CultureShop price \u00a37.99 + 99p&amp;p) When 16-year-old Anthony finds the girlfriend he's hardly yet found the courage to kiss underneath another guy at a party, he decides it's time for no more Mr Nice Guy. So he gets a job at the local burger drive-thru where his rival works, and plots a carefully planned revenge. Only his rival is almost always one step ahead of the game. Much of the pleasure of Matthew Anderson's comic novel comes from the burger wars that ensue and the clash of values between corporate America and the dissidents like Anthony and Shunt, the vegan burger flipper, who refuse to buy into the dream. The writing is flip and cynical. Great fun.",

      "body": "<p>In the stormy seas which engulf the House of Commons, it will probably be dismissed as a bill blown off course by freak waves. But the maiden voyage of the utilities bill - a flagship piece of legislation designed to regulate the gas, electricity, water and telecommunications industries - has turned into Westminster's equivalent of Mutiny on the Bounty. </p> <p>The bill began promisingly enough when it was launched in January. The Department of Trade and Industry proudly boasted that it would reduce our bills by 10%. This was New Labour putting consumers before shareholders and the environment before executive pay. But if the sentiment of the bill was on message, the detail left a lot to be desired. By committee stage in the Commons, MPs had put down over 900 amendments and the bill was sailing into troubled waters. </p> <p>In March, the environmental movement tried to steer the bill back on course by tabling a series of amendments through the Liberal Democrats and furiously lobbying Labour backbenchers.

      "bodyText": "In the stormy seas which engulf the House of Commons, it will probably be dismissed as a bill blown off course by freak waves. But the maiden voyage of the utilities bill - a flagship piece of legislation designed to regulate the gas, electricity, water and telecommunications industries - has turned into Westminster's equivalent of Mutiny on the Bounty. The bill began promisingly enough when it was launched in January. The Department of Trade and Industry proudly boasted that it would reduce our bills by 10%. This was New Labour putting consumers before shareholders and the environment before executive pay. But if the sentiment of the bill was on message, the detail left a lot to be desired. By committee stage in the Commons, MPs had put down over 900 amendments and the bill was sailing into troubled waters. In March, the environmental movement tried to steer the bill back on course by tabling a series of amendments through the Liberal Democrats and furiously lobbying Labour backbenchers. Everything was going well for a big showdown over sustainable development until Andrew Stunnell and Norman Baker failed to appear in the Commons - an admirable example of Liberal Democrat joined up thinking. Unsurprisingly, their amendment sunk without trace. Unbeknown to the loyal New Labour members serving on the committee, the government had been shaken by the telephone and digital companies, who threatened to open fire if telecommunications were not withdrawn from the bill. In the ensuing battle, the telephone companies, with the support of John Prescott, won a resounding victory.

      "body": "<p>At rush hour, Gaela Benn got out of the tube at the wrong station and, standing with her guide dog, called out for help. But despite being continuously surrounded by a crowd, she stood helplessly on the packed platform, unaided for 20 minutes. The problem was that not only is she blind, she is also profoundly deaf.</p> <p>Gaela has no doubt that people offered help, but they were baffled as to how to communicate with her. Human contact can only come from the touch of a person in the outside world who is invisible to her and cannot be heard by her. </p> <p>There are roughly 20,000 deafblind people in Britain and how to get through their almost impenetrable isolation is one of the great challenges of a civilised society - a challenge not very vigorously taken up by the authorities, it must be said. There is, for example, no automatic right to provision of a carer. </p> <p>Gaela Benn is in a minority of that isolated 20,000; the majority of deafblind people are born with that condition, but she has a perfect memory of the sights and sounds of the world around her. Now in her forties, it wasn't until she was 30 that she was diagnosed as suffering from Usher syndrome, a genetic disorder which progressively attacks hearing and sight. </p> <p>Her ability to appear to function as a hearing person creates additional problems. Many deaf people can only manage a distorted form of speech in hesitant rhythms. But Gaela, who also walks with an alert, unflinching air, retained perfect diction, her fluency unimpaired. It is almost impossible to believe that while Galea responds to you in perfectly natural speech no sound is reaching her.</p> <p>As in many cases, neither her parents nor her GP realised she had hearing difficulties until she was in her teens. At school, she was considered to be stupid or slow, a friend says, because she laughed at the wrong time or didn't laugh at the right one. An examination in a GP's quiet surgery didn't reveal the defect, since at that stage the difficulty came only from external noises. </p> <p>When the diagnosis came it was brutal. In an interview that did not last more than 10 minutes, the specialist told her the condition was irreversible, untreatable. </p> <p>In a BBC2 documentary, Deafblind, Gaela tells the director, Mischa Scorer, what her reaction was. \"He treated me as if I were a piece of wood with no feelings at all,\" she says. \"Medically there was nothing more you can do, end of story and off you go\". </p> <p>This is characteristic of the reaction of some medical people who become indignant and almost hostile when faced with a human condition totally outside their control. </p> <p>Scorer, who won an Emmy in 1984 for Heart of the Dragon, one of the first western documentaries filmed in China, took a long time to win the confidence of a person who, as Gaela describes it herself, lives in a world in which \"a black box completely surrounds you, all frosty glass and all you can see through it is the light and vague movements... [hearing nothing] your world exists only in what you can actually touch with your hands. Beyond what you can touch with your hands, or someone making physical contact with you, nothing exists\". </p> <p>Gaela had the choice of retreating into institutionalised home life, rarely going out, as many deafblind people do, or of constructing a life of her own. She chose to create an independent life, cooking and taking care of herself in her council flat. But she rejects any talk of heroic triumph over disability. She says that deafblindness is not the whole story of her life; she also lives as a human being. She is fortunate in having a friend with whom she went to adult education classes. For many years, this friend (who does not wish to be named) has been her interpreter and helper. </p> <p>There is a deafblind alphabet in which every letter is tapped out on the palm of the hand, laboriously, as in a written language. But Gaela discovered that her hands were not sensitive enough to keep track of this stream of letters. She often found that only part of a letter was conveyed through touch: the letter D, for example, came out unintelligibly as a touch at top and bottom, or there might be something missing from an R. </p> <p>With her friend, she worked out a more \"comfortable\" language. Gaela thinks visually and the language is, curiously enough, more \"visual\", with an element of touch mime. </p> <p>But the skills deafblind people can acquire are astonishing. In Scorer's documentary we also see Graham Hicks, registered blind from the age of three and profoundly deaf by seven, deftly operating a power saw. He is a skilled DIY worker and cook. </p> <p>As he learned to speak as a child, he does not have to endure the profound isolation of those born deafblind and who are almost out of reach of any form of language. Graham can speak in a halting fashion, but is perfectly capable of expressing himself. He can also communicate through touch, using a finger alphabet. But there is a profound distance between deafblind people and those with normally functioning senses. He says it is impossible for people to understand what this disability is like. </p> <p>Graham is married to Jackie Hicks, chief executive of Deafblind UK. \"He is a person just like I am,\" she says, \"but in the way he relates to the world he is very, very different from me. To make things work, I have to understand that all the time. And, to some extent, he has to understand how I relate to the world as well. </p> <p>\"It is very true that sight and hearing are distance senses; they give us a sense of what is happening outside ourselves.

      "bodyText": "At rush hour, Gaela Benn got out of the tube at the wrong station and, standing with her guide dog, called out for help. But despite being continuously surrounded by a crowd, she stood helplessly on the packed platform, unaided for 20 minutes. The problem was that not only is she blind, she is also profoundly deaf. Gaela has no doubt that people offered help, but they were baffled as to how to communicate with her. Human contact can only come from the touch of a person in the outside world who is invisible to her and cannot be heard by her. There are roughly 20,000 deafblind people in Britain and how to get through their almost impenetrable isolation is one of the great challenges of a civilised society - a challenge not very vigorously taken up by the authorities, it must be said. There is, for example, no automatic right to provision of a carer. Gaela Benn is in a minority of that isolated 20,000; the majority of deafblind people are born with that condition, but she has a perfect memory of the sights and sounds of the world around her. Now in her forties, it wasn't until she was 30 that she was diagnosed as suffering from Usher syndrome, a genetic disorder which progressively attacks hearing and sight. Her ability to appear to function as a hearing person creates additional problems. Many deaf people can only manage a distorted form of speech in hesitant rhythms. But Gaela, who also walks with an alert, unflinching air, retained perfect diction, her fluency unimpaired. It is almost impossible to believe that while Galea responds to you in perfectly natural speech no sound is reaching her. As in many cases, neither her parents nor her GP realised she had hearing difficulties until she was in her teens. At school, she was considered to be stupid or slow, a friend says, because she laughed at the wrong time or didn't laugh at the right one. An examination in a GP's quiet surgery didn't reveal the defect, since at that stage the difficulty came only from external noises. When the diagnosis came it was brutal. In an interview that did not last more than 10 minutes, the specialist told her the condition was irreversible, untreatable. In a BBC2 documentary, Deafblind, Gaela tells the director, Mischa Scorer, what her reaction was. \"He treated me as if I were a piece of wood with no feelings at all,\" she says. \"Medically there was nothing more you can do, end of story and off you go\". This is characteristic of the reaction of some medical people who become indignant and almost hostile when faced with a human condition totally outside their control. Scorer, who won an Emmy in 1984 for Heart of the Dragon, one of the first western documentaries filmed in China, took a long time to win the confidence of a person who, as Gaela describes it herself, lives in a world in which \"a black box completely surrounds you, all frosty glass and all you can see through it is the light and vague movements... [hearing nothing] your world exists only in what you can actually touch with your hands. Beyond what you can touch with your hands, or someone making physical contact with you, nothing exists\". Gaela had the choice of retreating into institutionalised home life, rarely going out, as many deafblind people do, or of constructing a life of her own. She chose to create an independent life, cooking and taking care of herself in her council flat. But she rejects any talk of heroic triumph over disability. She says that deafblindness is not the whole story of her life; she also lives as a human being. She is fortunate in having a friend with whom she went to adult education classes. For many years, this friend (who does not wish to be named) has been her interpreter and helper. There is a deafblind alphabet in which every letter is tapped out on the palm of the hand, laboriously, as in a written language. But Gaela discovered that her hands were not sensitive enough to keep track of this stream of letters. She often found that only part of a letter was conveyed through touch: the letter D, for example, came out unintelligibly as a touch at top and bottom, or there might be something missing from an R. With her friend, she worked out a more \"comfortable\" language. Gaela thinks visually and the language is, curiously enough, more \"visual\", with an element of touch mime. But the skills deafblind people can acquire are astonishing. In Scorer's documentary we also see Graham Hicks, registered blind from the age of three and profoundly deaf by seven, deftly operating a power saw. He is a skilled DIY worker and cook. As he learned to speak as a child, he does not have to endure the profound isolation of those born deafblind and who are almost out of reach of any form of language. Graham can speak in a halting fashion, but is perfectly capable of expressing himself. He can also communicate through touch, using a finger alphabet. But there is a profound distance between deafblind people and those with normally functioning senses. He says it is impossible for people to understand what this disability is like. Graham is married to Jackie Hicks, chief executive of Deafblind UK. \"He is a person just like I am,\" she says, \"but in the way he relates to the world he is very, very different from me. To make things work, I have to understand that all the time. And, to some extent, he has to understand how I relate to the world as well. \"It is very true that sight and hearing are distance senses; they give us a sense of what is happening outside ourselves. Much more of Graham's life, it seems to me, is happening within his body and what he can reach and what he can touch. He is less in touch with things that are much further outside himself. He can get access to the news, but other things that are happening around us he hasn't access to and has to be told. So you have to get quite deeply into that sort of understanding.\" If deafblind people are in effect disregarded by government, the reason is obvious: they are mostly unseen and are the least capable of effective protest. \u0095 The documentary, Deafblind, will be broadcast in the Under the Sun series on BBC2 tomorrow at 9.30pm. \u0095 Deafblind UK is at 01733 358100 \u0095 Sense also works with the deafblind and offers support for families, carers and professionals.

      "body": "<p>The prime minister is unequivocal. In the latest issue of Red magazine, he talks of adoption being \"too bureaucratic\" and suggests it needs \"a radical overhaul - I want to make it easier for children to be placed quickly\".</p> <p>He has already held a Downing Street seminar on the issue, a report is currently being drawn up by a cabinet office taskforce, and a consultation paper is due this autumn. The moves follow the Waterhouse report into abuse in children's homes in north Wales, published in February, which prompted Conservatives to propose an adoption plan for every child in care. </p> <p>There is nothing new about adoption being used as a political football. What disturbs social care professionals is the way in which both major parties have been simplifying a complex issue and ignoring the fact that, of the 55,000 children in care, the number in children's homes has shrunk to a small minority: about 14,000, many of whom do not want to be adopted. </p> <p>The politicians continue to ignore the huge change which has taken place in adoption - from a service helping infertile couples to obtain a baby, to the infinitely more difficult task of placing badly abused children into adoptive families where skilled adults can help them through their trauma and damage.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister is unequivocal. In the latest issue of Red magazine, he talks of adoption being \"too bureaucratic\" and suggests it needs \"a radical overhaul - I want to make it easier for children to be placed quickly\". He has already held a Downing Street seminar on the issue, a report is currently being drawn up by a cabinet office taskforce, and a consultation paper is due this autumn. The moves follow the Waterhouse report into abuse in children's homes in north Wales, published in February, which prompted Conservatives to propose an adoption plan for every child in care. There is nothing new about adoption being used as a political football. What disturbs social care professionals is the way in which both major parties have been simplifying a complex issue and ignoring the fact that, of the 55,000 children in care, the number in children's homes has shrunk to a small minority: about 14,000, many of whom do not want to be adopted. The politicians continue to ignore the huge change which has taken place in adoption - from a service helping infertile couples to obtain a baby, to the infinitely more difficult task of placing badly abused children into adoptive families where skilled adults can help them through their trauma and damage. Adoption is no longer a one-off transaction. Many adoptive families will require social service support for years. Critics of the current system say social workers, driven by ideology, block decent ordinary people from adopting children and condemn those children to a lifetime of misery in the care system. Reforms have always been billed as a means to curtail politically correct social workers and the reality of adoption, including pros and cons, has been buried under the rhetoric.

They assume that any such challenge could only come from people corrupted by soapy emotionalism with a deep hostility to science itself.</p> <p>For me, nothing could be further from the truth. In reviewing the contribution that science makes in meeting the challenge of sustainable development, I came to the conclusion that science is absolutely at the heart of that challenge. All our endeavours to build a genuinely sustainable way of life for 6bn people today, and around 10bn by 2050, are totally dependent on high quality scientific research, and the policies and sustainable technologies that flow from that research. It's no good bleating on about the dangers of \"technological fixes\"; without those fixes (in energy, transport, waste minimisation, pollution control and so on), we're quite simply stuffed. </p> <p>Massive investment in research and new technology is, therefore, a necessary condition of achieving sustainable development. But it is not a sufficient condition. And that's where my concern about the inadequacies of the scientific method, and the intolerant fundamentalism of those like Richard Dawkins and Lewis Wolpert who subscribe to the religion of scientific materialism (for that is what it seems to be for them), comes to the fore. Paradoxically, nothing is more likely to reinforce a growing anti-science movement than their absolutist arrogance. </p> <p>If there's one issue that exemplifies this dilemma it is the whole question of the independence of science today. To what extent does the growing commercialisation of science render it unfit (or at least, less fit) to serve the public purpose without fear or favour? Underlying all those surveys about how much trust the general public has in scientists today is the question of who they work for. Predictably, scientists working for the government are trusted less than scientists working for large companies, who in turn are trusted much, much less than scientists working for environmental organisations. </p> <p>People's suspicions today are stronger than they've ever been, and with good reason, given that such a huge percentage of scientists are now paid by private or public sector employers who often have little interest in open scientific debate. Official government secrecy, commercial confidentiality, and the ever-present threat of funding being withdrawn are quite sufficient to button the lips of all but the most courageous. </p> <p>This is not a new phenomenon. At several points in Silent Spring, published in 1962, Rachel Carson comments on the complicity of so many of the government scientists she came into contact with when researching the impact of pesticides on the environment and human health. She sympathised with their dilemma, but had little respect for what she saw as the dereliction of their duty as scientists, however dutiful they were as government officials. In private correspondence, she often quoted Abraham Lincoln: \"To sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of men.\" </p> <p>One can only surmise that Carson would be distraught at what is happening today, when not just cowardice but \"science for sale\" has become a familiar phenomenon, and when the stranglehold of large companies has become a great deal tighter than it was when Carson was writing in the early 1960s. </p> <p>Many leading scientists simply refuse to acknowledge either the extent or the significance of this phenomenon of co-option. The eminent geneticist Steve Jones often points out that \"money doesn't smell\" - by which he means that the source of any grant or research budget doesn't really matter, as the inherent integrity of the scientific method (and of the individual scientists themselves) will act as a sure defence against any malign influence. </p> <p>One only has to look at the use of science in two critical environmental debates, climate change and genetic engineering, to see what complete tosh this is. </p> <p>Research in climate change is largely government-driven, mediated through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

Here the science is owned - literally and metaphorically - by a small number of very large companies. Much of the research is commercially confidential, never sees the light of day, and is carried out with the sole intent of generating future revenue streams. Nothing wrong with that in itself, of course, but it raises a substantial question mark over both the quality and the transparency of the research work done. UK politicians must now be ruefully reflecting on just how important a factor this has been in the collapse of the biotech industry across Europe. </p> <p>Beneath all this lurks a deeper issue.

With more money spent on signalling, improved maintenance and more rolling stock the numbers travelling by rail could be doubled without adding an inch of extra track. Labour's \u00a3140 billion boost for transport as it is billed will be an opportunity missed. A good slice of this massive sum will be wasted on roads that will make no difference to the mess.

Yet we are intent on going backwards. Experience has already taught us that building a new section of road encourages more traffic, and merely moves the jam somewhere else. This is not anecdotal, this is proven and acknowledged by transport planners. This does not mean a bypass or an improved junction does not ease local congestion and make some people's life better, but the claim that more and more roads represent value for money is hard to accept. 50 cars on a city road take up a lot of space. 10 buses using less tarmac could carry 500 people to work. Yet the freedom to drive anywhere is code for the right to prevent public transport working efficiently. Two or three hundred people travel in a train. With more money spent on signalling, improved maintenance and more rolling stock the numbers travelling by rail could be doubled without adding an inch of extra track. Labour's \u00a3140 billion boost for transport as it is billed will be an opportunity missed. A good slice of this massive sum will be wasted on roads that will make no difference to the mess. The main hope now is that the much-predicted rise in teleworking and other advances in technology will really allow half the nation to stay at home rather than grind their way to work through gridlocked Britain.",

At the moment government departments are busy staking their claims to the cash hence recent media frenzy about public spending. <p><b>Where does this extra money come from?</b><br> Recently the exchequer has been showing a robust surplus - this year the government expects to raise some \u00a317bn in taxes even after spending has been taken into account. Falling unemployment and the minimum wage mean that social security costs are lower than in the past, while the recent auction of mobile phone licences raised an unexpected \u00a322bn. Some of this cash will be used to repay part of Britain's national debt, but there is money left over to increase public spending - or cut taxes.</p> <p><b>Which areas will benefit?</b><br> Every government minister is convinced that his or her ministry is particularly deserving of the chancellor's generosity. In fact, the additional spending will be concentrated on only a few areas. The Department of Health is the only certain winner announced so far. In the March budget, Gordon Brown promised the NHS an extra \u00a313bn. Education looks like another likely gainer with promises this week that the CSR would include measures to widen access to higher education. John Prescott, head of the department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions wants a \u00a3140 million cash reserve for transport programmes over the next 10 years and has every chance of succeeding in his demands. Regional development agencies, too, will gain extra funding to help in the regeneration of their areas. Finally, Gordon Brown has made the eradication of child poverty a personal cause and will use the CSR to help combat it. The government is committed to halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it by 2020. </p> <p><b>Is it all good news?</b><br> Not quite. Gordon Brown set a ceiling for growth in real total spending of 2.5 percent a year in his last budget. To meet this, the CSR may actually cut spending in certain areas, the Ministry of Defence being a likely target. And his generosity comes at a price. In return for the extra cash the Treasury wants ministries to meet precise performance targets. The aim is to ensure that the additional money is used effectively - but the effect of this will be to increase the Treasury's control over everything the government does. This is naturally unpopular with ministers in all other departments. Critics claim it will make the government more presidential and less consensual leading to bureaucratic interference from the centre.</p> <p><b>What do the other parties think?</b><br> The Tory party complain that Gordon Brown's plans will lead to a \"high taxing, high spending\" administration. They want the cash spent on tax cuts instead and suggest the chancellor is planning an uncontrolled spending spree to shore up the government's position at the polls.

The newspaper also claims the baby is the result of artificial insemination. Foster already has a son, Charlie, who was born in July 1998. She has always refused to discuss the name of the father. \u0095 Lord of the Rings conceptual artist John Howe was recently interviewed in the French magazine Mad Movies on the forthcoming trilogy and his relationship with director Peter Jackson. Read the full transcript on Cinescape. \u0095 Bruce Willis has stopped being represented by the William Morris agency. The actor, who'll soon star in Barry Levinson's Outlaws for MGM, has entered into a business partnership with his former agent and William Morris top man, Arnold Rifkin. While Rifkin's new venture, Cheyenne, will partner with Willis on forthcoming projects, the star will in fact have neither an agent nor a manager - only heavyweight entertainment attorney Skip Brittenham who will serve as his rep on deals. Casting couch \u0095 After rumours that Edward Woodward was to take over the role (see our May 18 report), it was announced this weekend that Dame Judy Dench will return as M, 007's superior in the next Bond film. \u0095 The remake of the Rat Pack movie, Ocean's Eleven, helmed by Steven Soderbergh, just keeps attracting big name after big name. It is rumoured that Bill Murray is to sign shortly while Warren Beatty, John Turturro and Michael Douglas have all been \"in talks\" about possible roles. The cast already includes Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Bruce Willis and Johnny Depp no less. \u0095 Jonny Lee Miller has joined the cast of Wes Craven Presents: Dracula 2000. The film, to be directed by long-time Craven collaborator Patrick Lussier, will turn the classic Stoker tale into a modern version. It is rumoured that Miller is to play the part of an antiques expert who assists Dr Van Helsing, to be played by Christopher Plummer.",

      "body": "<p>There is no getting away from bohemians right now, though that does not mean you will run into any examples of the species on the streets of its American breeding ground, Greenwich Village. </p> <p>Here, where the monthly rent of the average apartment now would once have been enough to fund a lifetime of squalid enlightenment, they are said by some accounts to have run out of steam not long after the first world war. </p> <p>But bookshops and public prints are full of bohemians and they contain a bewildering array of definitions of the term. For Christine Stansell in American Moderns: Bohemian New York and the Creation of a New Century, they represented a fusion of freedoms in politics, culture and personal relations. The Princeton history professor says this happened between 1890 and 1920 and has since subsided into \"inspiration for renovating middle-class life\". </p> <p>If Anatole Broyard or Joseph Mitchell were alive today, they might disagree with this evaluation, of course. Broyard's unfinished memoir of life in the Village of the 1940s, Kafka Was the Rage, relies for its connection to bohemianism mostly on elegiac musings on his short-lived bookshop and a girlfriend who was both an artist and something of a puzzle. </p> <p>Mitchell's book, Joe Gould's Secret, is an unusually irritating work putting together two very long pieces from the New Yorker, published in 1942 and 1964. Most readers should work out the secret, such as it is, more rapidly than they could ever arrive at a reason for the writer's fascination with a self-obsessed homeless person who is obviously mentally ill. The supposedly bohemian Gould's main achievements in the service of freedom seemed to involve free drinks. </p> <p>Stanley Tucci has turned the Kleenex-thin story into a movie of the same name that, while it is a sensitive evocation of the Village before the century's halfway point, cannot resist tagging on a production-line cinema ending that never happened. Then, just before the credits roll, we are told that after the second piece appeared Mitchell continued to go to work until he died in 1996 but never published another word. </p> <p>We are supposed to believe that the writer's hand was stilled by the recognition of something of himself in his subject, but anyone who has ever worked for a living is more likely to wonder why the magazine did not show him the door. </p> <p>Ann Powers suggests in her book, Weird Like Us: My Bohemian America, that, far from being a thing of the past, there's a touch of the counter-culture in everyone because its values have entered the mainstream - which brings us back to refurbished middle-class life and a piece in the New York Times magazine by Rob Walker, who writes with some disdain that it is now possible to pass as mainstream and a hipster at the same time. He calls these people fauxhemians. </p> <p>A number of lightning rods for this cultural, counter-cultural or even imaginary social grouping, which is very likely unaware of its own existence, formed the core of the New Yorker's literary and arts festival: novelists, poets, journalists, editors, artists and activists. </p> <p>A sound drifted across the grass from a stage at one end of Bryant Park, the big backyard of the New York public library. \"Slush, slush, slush . . . South Carolina. Slush, slush, slush . . . inspected my shirt.\" </p> <p>This is Robert Pinsky, poet laureate of the United States, where they have the sense to limit tenure in the office to a fixed term so that the incumbent is less likely to find himself without any lead in his pencil or to have forgotten which one is the Queen Mum. </p> <p>Pinsky was part of the rather muted climax to the festival and his words might have been very fine but it was a little difficult to be sure as they oscillated around the sky-rise canyon on 42nd Street. </p> <p>No one seemed to mind. A polite couple of thousand lounged on the sunny lawns, the rude klaxons of emergency vehicles suggesting that poetry might be in crisis.

      "bodyText": "There is no getting away from bohemians right now, though that does not mean you will run into any examples of the species on the streets of its American breeding ground, Greenwich Village. Here, where the monthly rent of the average apartment now would once have been enough to fund a lifetime of squalid enlightenment, they are said by some accounts to have run out of steam not long after the first world war. But bookshops and public prints are full of bohemians and they contain a bewildering array of definitions of the term. For Christine Stansell in American Moderns: Bohemian New York and the Creation of a New Century, they represented a fusion of freedoms in politics, culture and personal relations. The Princeton history professor says this happened between 1890 and 1920 and has since subsided into \"inspiration for renovating middle-class life\". If Anatole Broyard or Joseph Mitchell were alive today, they might disagree with this evaluation, of course. Broyard's unfinished memoir of life in the Village of the 1940s, Kafka Was the Rage, relies for its connection to bohemianism mostly on elegiac musings on his short-lived bookshop and a girlfriend who was both an artist and something of a puzzle. Mitchell's book, Joe Gould's Secret, is an unusually irritating work putting together two very long pieces from the New Yorker, published in 1942 and 1964. Most readers should work out the secret, such as it is, more rapidly than they could ever arrive at a reason for the writer's fascination with a self-obsessed homeless person who is obviously mentally ill. The supposedly bohemian Gould's main achievements in the service of freedom seemed to involve free drinks. Stanley Tucci has turned the Kleenex-thin story into a movie of the same name that, while it is a sensitive evocation of the Village before the century's halfway point, cannot resist tagging on a production-line cinema ending that never happened. Then, just before the credits roll, we are told that after the second piece appeared Mitchell continued to go to work until he died in 1996 but never published another word. We are supposed to believe that the writer's hand was stilled by the recognition of something of himself in his subject, but anyone who has ever worked for a living is more likely to wonder why the magazine did not show him the door. Ann Powers suggests in her book, Weird Like Us: My Bohemian America, that, far from being a thing of the past, there's a touch of the counter-culture in everyone because its values have entered the mainstream - which brings us back to refurbished middle-class life and a piece in the New York Times magazine by Rob Walker, who writes with some disdain that it is now possible to pass as mainstream and a hipster at the same time. He calls these people fauxhemians. A number of lightning rods for this cultural, counter-cultural or even imaginary social grouping, which is very likely unaware of its own existence, formed the core of the New Yorker's literary and arts festival: novelists, poets, journalists, editors, artists and activists. A sound drifted across the grass from a stage at one end of Bryant Park, the big backyard of the New York public library. \"Slush, slush, slush . . . South Carolina. Slush, slush, slush . . . inspected my shirt.\" This is Robert Pinsky, poet laureate of the United States, where they have the sense to limit tenure in the office to a fixed term so that the incumbent is less likely to find himself without any lead in his pencil or to have forgotten which one is the Queen Mum. Pinsky was part of the rather muted climax to the festival and his words might have been very fine but it was a little difficult to be sure as they oscillated around the sky-rise canyon on 42nd Street. No one seemed to mind. A polite couple of thousand lounged on the sunny lawns, the rude klaxons of emergency vehicles suggesting that poetry might be in crisis. Incidentally, there were as many black people here as you would find at the average blues gig: that is to say, not many at all. The event had a pleasantly hazy quality that made it feel a bit optional, a bit \"I wonder what I'll have for dinner tonight?\" Two nights earlier, Stephen King had appeared at the Bowery Ballroom and read a story that went on for nearly an hour. The mentions of oral sex and the swear words were greeted with particularly appreciative titters. This was King's first public outing since his near-fatal encounter last year with a motorist who appeared to be trying to drive his van and walk his dog at the same time. \"It's nice to be here,\" he said. \"Actually, it's nice to be anywhere.\" Yes, the old ones are the best. In his black denims and white T-shirt, jaw jutting as he attacked the microphone, discarding his crutch as though he were James Brown casting aside his cape, King could be an aged rocker. Bill Buford, literary editor of the New Yorker, said that the writer's vision had been overlooked in favour of his sales of more than 300m, and the reading rated highly on the true index of respect for a live performance - only two mobile phones went off. King's work has been conspicuously consumed and the writer has a pretty cool self-image: hallmarks of fauxhemianism.

And for a team whose most evocative names (WG Grace, Gilbert Jessop and Wally Hammond) were active before one-day cricket was even a twinkle in the administrators' eyes, it's about time too. True, Mike Procter and Zaheer Abbas did help Gloucestershire to two one-day pots in the 1970s (the Gillette Cup in 1973 and the B&amp;H in 1977), but these were isolated successes, and not part of a growing trend. </p> <p>Even so, \"Gloster\", as their vocal fans have it, have come almost from nowhere to become the one-day knockout team to avoid. It seems strange to talk about form teams in a format where anyone can beat anyone else on any given day. But the brief history of both cups is littered with examples of limited-overs experts. Sussex were the original one-day wizards, lifting the first two Gillette Cups (now the NatWest Trophy) in 1963 and 1964. Then, in the early 1970s, Lancashire took over as the team to topple, winning the Gillette three years on the trot, before Kent triumphed four times in six years (including three in the B&amp;H). Somerset won their first four pieces of silverware between 1979 and 1983 (one Gillette, two B&amp;Hs and one NatWest), then Lancashire returned to do the first NatWest/B&amp;H double, in 1990 - a feat they repeated six years later. In between, Warwickshire seemed to play at Lord's more often than at Edgbaston. </p> <p>But what makes Gloucestershire's glory unique is that they've shone without a star. Sussex, in those pre-overseas-player days, had England captain Ted Dexter (4502 Test runs), and Lancashire could call upon Clive Lloyd (7515). Kent boasted Asif Iqbal (3575), while Somerset got the best out of Ian Botham (5200 runs plus 383 wickets) and Viv Richards (8540 runs). The return of Lancashire coincided with the brilliance of Wasim Akram (398 wickets and counting), and Warwickshire had double world-record holder Brian Lara. </p> <p>Gloucestershire? Their star is Australian allrounder Ian Harvey (169 runs and eight wickets in one-day internationals, but currently injured). On Monday, Lancashire, with their galaxy of internationals, must have felt like West Indies in 1983 when they were overwhelmed by a distinctly underwhelming Indian team in the World Cup final. </p> <p>What Gloucestershire do possess is experience and youth, knowhow and enthusiasm. Flying the flag for the crumblies are Jack Russell (as valuable for the way he irritates the opposition as for his terrier-like stumpings), Mark Alleyne, Kim Barnett (now more of a genuine team player than the glowering godfather he resembled at Derby), and Mike Smith, a shorter, left-arm version of Gus Fraser. At the other end of the age spectrum are Jon Lewis, who recently took a Championship hat-trick, James Averis, whose 24 victims so far make him the leading one-day wicket-taker in the country, and Matthew Windows, opening up at long last. </p> <p>It all adds up to, well, more than it probably should. Which may be part of the reason Gloucestershire have been riding high. Problems may arise when people start expecting them to win time after time. In fact, they might arise on June 10, when Gloucestershire must begin as favourites to beat Glamorgan, who haven't made it to Lord's since losing to Middlesex in the 1977 NatWest final. But if Gloucester do hold their nerve, they will become the first side ever to win three knockout trophies in a row. Then they really will have to be called the latest, greatest one-day team. </p> <p><em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com.

Even so, \"Gloster\", as their vocal fans have it, have come almost from nowhere to become the one-day knockout team to avoid. It seems strange to talk about form teams in a format where anyone can beat anyone else on any given day. But the brief history of both cups is littered with examples of limited-overs experts. Sussex were the original one-day wizards, lifting the first two Gillette Cups (now the NatWest Trophy) in 1963 and 1964. Then, in the early 1970s, Lancashire took over as the team to topple, winning the Gillette three years on the trot, before Kent triumphed four times in six years (including three in the B&amp;H). Somerset won their first four pieces of silverware between 1979 and 1983 (one Gillette, two B&amp;Hs and one NatWest), then Lancashire returned to do the first NatWest/B&amp;H double, in 1990 - a feat they repeated six years later. In between, Warwickshire seemed to play at Lord's more often than at Edgbaston. But what makes Gloucestershire's glory unique is that they've shone without a star. Sussex, in those pre-overseas-player days, had England captain Ted Dexter (4502 Test runs), and Lancashire could call upon Clive Lloyd (7515). Kent boasted Asif Iqbal (3575), while Somerset got the best out of Ian Botham (5200 runs plus 383 wickets) and Viv Richards (8540 runs). The return of Lancashire coincided with the brilliance of Wasim Akram (398 wickets and counting), and Warwickshire had double world-record holder Brian Lara. Gloucestershire? Their star is Australian allrounder Ian Harvey (169 runs and eight wickets in one-day internationals, but currently injured). On Monday, Lancashire, with their galaxy of internationals, must have felt like West Indies in 1983 when they were overwhelmed by a distinctly underwhelming Indian team in the World Cup final. What Gloucestershire do possess is experience and youth, knowhow and enthusiasm. Flying the flag for the crumblies are Jack Russell (as valuable for the way he irritates the opposition as for his terrier-like stumpings), Mark Alleyne, Kim Barnett (now more of a genuine team player than the glowering godfather he resembled at Derby), and Mike Smith, a shorter, left-arm version of Gus Fraser. At the other end of the age spectrum are Jon Lewis, who recently took a Championship hat-trick, James Averis, whose 24 victims so far make him the leading one-day wicket-taker in the country, and Matthew Windows, opening up at long last. It all adds up to, well, more than it probably should. Which may be part of the reason Gloucestershire have been riding high. Problems may arise when people start expecting them to win time after time. In fact, they might arise on June 10, when Gloucestershire must begin as favourites to beat Glamorgan, who haven't made it to Lord's since losing to Middlesex in the 1977 NatWest final. But if Gloucester do hold their nerve, they will become the first side ever to win three knockout trophies in a row. Then they really will have to be called the latest, greatest one-day team.

      "trailText": "<p>Susan Greenfield, director of the Royal Institution, thinks the problem of girls in science has been sorted. And women in science? That's another matter.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Susan Greenfield, Oxford professor of synaptic pharmacology, the director of the Royal Institution, is a neuroscientist, which is about as scary as you can get on the scale of scary things. On her desk is a paper entitled \"Ultrastructural evidence for dendritic release of acetylcholinesterase in the rat substantia nigra \", which she would be reading in her coffee break if she hadn't already removed coffee, mindful of its deleterious effects, from her daily regime. She counts the study of consciousness as one of her hobbies, writing her books - the bestselling The Human Brain: A Guided Tour (Phoenix Press, \u00a36.99), and her latest, The Private Life of the Brain (Penguin, \u00a318.99) - as a form of relaxation, \"on Sundays as others might do cooking or gardening\". In short, she is a woman who knows her own mind, and possibly yours, too. </p> <p>\"My hair,\" she exclaims, whisking into the room, a large mouth on thin legs, somewhere between a tabloid columnist and an American intellectual. She is wearing a sexy, fitted, red jacket and high, stacked heels. She is 50 this year, and looks 40. \"New short haircut and it's so hard to get short hair right.\" She attacks it with her fingers. \"I just do not take a good picture.\" She points to a series of photos on the wall - \"You see. Haggard.\" She was in Hello! recently and \"to be honest I was slightly disappointed with the results. Perhaps one automatically thinks one is going to look like Naomi Campbell and, of course, I didn't. I looked like a dumpy middle-aged female scientist.\" As if she could ever look like a scientist, let alone a dumpy middle-aged one. </p> <p>Greenfield is the television face of science, the Anne Robinson of the laboratory world. See her in a white coat and, chance as not, it's a little cream trench coat by Armani. You can find her at Chequers (\"just a very nice dinner party\"), or in the City (she has set up a limited company in preparation for any pharmaceutical rewards from her research), or \"zapping around the capital with a mobile phone clamped to my ear\". She's not afraid to tell you that Desert Island Discs was \"the apotheosis of my career\", or to describe arriving in a television studio (her series, Brain Story, is on BBC2 in July) as \"coming home\", or to confess that she wants to turn the fusty old Royal Institution into \"a Groucho Club for scientists\". She wants a society in which science is not Prince Charles's big, bad wolf: \"I don't want to wave a magic wand and make everybody like scientists - of course not. But I would like to see a society where we are scientifically literate.\" It's one of her \"credos\". She is accessibility writ large, at large. </p> <p>In her latest book, she sets out to show how pleasure necessitates a temporary abnegation of the self, that it involves the letting go of the personalised configurations of brain connections you may have spent a lifetime building up. If pure emotion and what Greenfield defines as the mind are at separate ends of the continuum, it is easy to see at which end of the continuum she lurks. She talks fantastically fast, but her eyes look at you steadily as if judging your reaction. \"Yeah-yeah?\" she says instead of punctuation, keeping you with her. </p> <p>She knows how she might appear to the stuffier members of the scientific establishment. She has an internal Geiger counter that tells her how uncomfortable they are with the fact that she's a woman: \"You can see the shutter coming down. </p> <p>\"If you try to do something that's different or original, it is inevitable that people are going to be critical.

      "bodyText": "Susan Greenfield, Oxford professor of synaptic pharmacology, the director of the Royal Institution, is a neuroscientist, which is about as scary as you can get on the scale of scary things. On her desk is a paper entitled \"Ultrastructural evidence for dendritic release of acetylcholinesterase in the rat substantia nigra \", which she would be reading in her coffee break if she hadn't already removed coffee, mindful of its deleterious effects, from her daily regime. She counts the study of consciousness as one of her hobbies, writing her books - the bestselling The Human Brain: A Guided Tour (Phoenix Press, \u00a36.99), and her latest, The Private Life of the Brain (Penguin, \u00a318.99) - as a form of relaxation, \"on Sundays as others might do cooking or gardening\". In short, she is a woman who knows her own mind, and possibly yours, too. \"My hair,\" she exclaims, whisking into the room, a large mouth on thin legs, somewhere between a tabloid columnist and an American intellectual. She is wearing a sexy, fitted, red jacket and high, stacked heels. She is 50 this year, and looks 40. \"New short haircut and it's so hard to get short hair right.\" She attacks it with her fingers. \"I just do not take a good picture.\" She points to a series of photos on the wall - \"You see. Haggard.\" She was in Hello! recently and \"to be honest I was slightly disappointed with the results. Perhaps one automatically thinks one is going to look like Naomi Campbell and, of course, I didn't. I looked like a dumpy middle-aged female scientist.\" As if she could ever look like a scientist, let alone a dumpy middle-aged one. Greenfield is the television face of science, the Anne Robinson of the laboratory world. See her in a white coat and, chance as not, it's a little cream trench coat by Armani. You can find her at Chequers (\"just a very nice dinner party\"), or in the City (she has set up a limited company in preparation for any pharmaceutical rewards from her research), or \"zapping around the capital with a mobile phone clamped to my ear\". She's not afraid to tell you that Desert Island Discs was \"the apotheosis of my career\", or to describe arriving in a television studio (her series, Brain Story, is on BBC2 in July) as \"coming home\", or to confess that she wants to turn the fusty old Royal Institution into \"a Groucho Club for scientists\". She wants a society in which science is not Prince Charles's big, bad wolf: \"I don't want to wave a magic wand and make everybody like scientists - of course not. But I would like to see a society where we are scientifically literate.\" It's one of her \"credos\". She is accessibility writ large, at large. In her latest book, she sets out to show how pleasure necessitates a temporary abnegation of the self, that it involves the letting go of the personalised configurations of brain connections you may have spent a lifetime building up. If pure emotion and what Greenfield defines as the mind are at separate ends of the continuum, it is easy to see at which end of the continuum she lurks. She talks fantastically fast, but her eyes look at you steadily as if judging your reaction. \"Yeah-yeah?\" she says instead of punctuation, keeping you with her. She knows how she might appear to the stuffier members of the scientific establishment. She has an internal Geiger counter that tells her how uncomfortable they are with the fact that she's a woman: \"You can see the shutter coming down. \"If you try to do something that's different or original, it is inevitable that people are going to be critical.

      "bodyText": "Headteachers threatened yesterday to defy rulings to take violent pupils back into school and complained they were being undermined by \"ridiculous\" government targets to reduce exclusions. The National Association of Head Teachers said it was considering advising its members to reject the orders of appeal panels to allow excluded pupils back in some cases. It is also considering taking legal action against \"perverse\" appeal panel decisions. Excluded pupils can appeal to a panel, which is independent, although constituted by the local education authority. On the first day of the NAHT's annual conference in Jersey, David Hart, the general secretary, said panels were allowing disruptive children into school because they felt pressured by the education secretary, David Blunkett, who had demanded that the number of permanently excluded pupils be reduced from 12,000 to 9,000 by 2002. Though Mr Blunkett recently made it clear that instant and permanent exclusion can be allowed for violence by pupils, the union believes that message has not got through to LEAs and appeal panels. Their rulings are undermining the authority of heads, it says. Two pupils excluded from different London schools for wielding knives - in one case a carving knife - had recently been allowed to return on appeal, against the wishes of the headteachers, Mr Hart said. Both incidents, which have been reported to Mr Blunkett, left other pupils \"desperately frightened\", and one teacher might refuse to teach one of the pupils involved.

      "byline": "Will Woodward",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is 9.05am and I am in front of a classroom of 14 and 15 year olds at Fulham Cross girls school, west London. \"My name's Will Woodward and I work for the Guardian. You've just been reading Animal Farm, haven't you? What do you know about the character of Squealer?\" </p> <p>I write my name on the blackboard in shorthand and talk about that. Then I hand out newspaper cuttings about asylum seekers. This is the idea of Jim Grealy, the head of English: to get the class to write about asylum so that they have to deliberately manipulate the language, like Squealer did to create an impression. To deal with words like flood, tide, bogus and scrounger. </p> <p>Taking Grealy's advice, I set them to write quite a lot - three sides each in 55 minutes - in a newspaper style about asylum seekers. Failing to act on his advice, I talk for more than five minutes about what they should do. They get the idea but some look a bit confused. A few ask for help from their normal teacher, Sophia Steele, who is in the room but trying not to get involved. </p> <p>\"Sir, who is the head of the police?\" </p> <p>\"Sir, do you know what the capital of Sierra Leone is?\" </p> <p>\"Sir, who decides if asylum seekers can stay?\" </p> <p>The work they produce is very strong, but then this, the top set of the second oldest year, should be the easiest lesson I have all day. In a class where many are first- or second-generation immigrants, most write provocatively about asylum seekers, against the grain of their thinking. Jessica comes up with emotive words such as \"parasites\"; Diana writes of refugees coming to Britain on a \"luxury holiday package\". There are also powerful descriptions of why asylum seekers come to this country and how they are treated when they get here. </p> <p>After each girl reads out bits of their work, they clap each other. The lesson goes OK, not great. Sophia Steele says it was interesting, but that I should have got them talking a bit more at the beginning. \"It would have been good to give them 10 minutes to discuss it in groups, and then get feedback, and have a kind of discussion.\" </p> <p>As I walk into my next lesson, the chances of having any kind of discussion appears nil. The noise is somewhere between a football crowd and a pneumatic drill. This year-nine class have just started doing a topic on Aids. So, suggested Grealy, get them to write a story about someone with HIV or Aids. </p> <p>The prospect of saying condom in front of a group of 13-year-old girls does not fill me with unconfined joy. They know I'm not a proper teacher. I am here because someone at the Campaign for Learning thought it would be a good idea for me to see what teaching was like for a day. And this is a 25-strong, second-from-top set in English, and they have seen me coming. </p> <p>Robina is shouting and Nilofar is wrapping herself in a curtain. </p> <p>\"Please, don't do that,\" I say. </p> <p>\"Go away.\" </p> <p>\"Now c'mon, you need to get on with some work.\" </p> <p>Nilofar sits under her desk with her paper on her chair. </p> <p>\"It's better to work like this.\" </p> <p>In big letters she writes: \"I have Aids. Poo hoo hoo.\" </p> <p>\"Look! Look! Look at what Nilofar's done!\" says a girl whose surname is Attack. </p> <p>Lee chews gum, takes gum out, throws gum away, moves seats. \"I'm moving away from HER!\" she says before singing a song which ends with the phrase \"my skiddy knickers\". </p> <p>Robina won't turn round. \"I am turned round.\" </p> <p>Kayleigh only wants to speak to the class teacher, Letty Jackson. \"No. I want miss.\" </p> <p>\"Hey c'mon, c'mon. You really have got to get on with some work now or you're in trouble. You've got 25 minutes now . . . Oh, please don't, please don't.\" </p> <p>\"Sir, have you ever interviewed anyone famous?\" </p> <p>\"Sir, do you insinuate the truth and try and invent things that are really happening?\" </p> <p>Nilofar wraps herself in the curtain again. </p> <p>When do I intervene, and when do I let it go? And why does this remind me of the May Day riot? </p> <p>\"Sir, I've finished, I can't write any more.\" </p> <p>\"Where are you going?\" </p> <p>Most of the aggro comes from a row of four desks by the window, where Robina, Bianca, Lee and Nilofar are. Most of the others want to work, and many produce good writing, full of informed comment about the spread of Aids. \"Come on, you've only got eight minutes now.\" </p> <p>\"I'm reading HERS.\" </p> <p>\"Can you make more of an effort.\" </p> <p>\"Can you get Aids from masturbation?\" </p> <p>\"I don't know anything about Aids. I've never even had sex.\" </p> <p>\"How long do you have to wait for the result of an Aids test?\" </p> <p>\"Sssssh.\" </p> <p>\"What's the doctor in the Simpsons called? The crap one.\" </p> <p>\"Has anybody got any queries?\" </p> <p>\"QUEER-ies!! Ha ha!\" </p> <p>\"Why should I? It's not worth it.\" </p> <p>\"Can you put that money away, sorry.\" </p> <p>\"Can you turn round, Robina.\" </p> <p>\"I'll read it out for her!\" </p> <p>Cheneka, one of the disruptive pupils at the beginning, produces only half a page, but it's among the best. Maddening, really. </p> <p>Somebody writes: \"My life is a mess. Living La Vita Loca! Oui monsieur? I have Aids and I am very sad. I am a lesbian but people don't understand what I am going through. Thong Ta Tong To Tong. I am not your girlfriend anymore!\" And that's about it in an hour and a half. </p> <p>\"We had some really good discussion last week,\" says Jackson. \"But some of these girls are very, very attention-seeking and some of them have got very poor levels of concentration. </p> <p>\"You were trying in a very adult way to talk to them and reason with them, but unfortunately they are a group where sometimes I have to be extremely heavy-handed and shout at them - and I mean shout at them.\" </p> <p>At lunch in the canteen, the head teacher, Jan Cartwright, hands out tokens for free school dinners which go to more than 50% of pupils. She gets in to work at 6.15am every day. Heather Ballantine, the head of years 10 and 11, who sits with me as I peer into shepherd's pie, gets in at 7.15am. She tells me the biggest discipline problem they have these days is with text messages being sent on mobile phones. Six hundred girls aged 11 to 16 go to school here, from Fulham, Acton, Battersea, and Ladbroke Grove. Between them they speak 50 languages. Almost all of their very best pupils speak a different language at home. The school is full and it doesn't have to take on excluded pupils, and the last time Ofsted visited it got some criticism but plenty of praise, especially for English. It is not posh but it is serious and well-organised. </p> <p>Jim Grealy is with me for the last lesson. This is also year nine, doing the same topic, but the top set this time. </p> <p>\"Sir, your tie's all wrong,\" says Okite in the front row, and I could be about to get anxious again, but then something marvellous happens. </p> <p>I hand out more newspaper cuttings on Aids and HIV and make some points, and I get them to talk about it. I make the instructions crystal clear. Imagine you've just been to interview someone with HIV or Aids: what would they say? </p> <p>I don't bother putting my name up on the board in shorthand this time, too distracting. And I remember to let them talk between themselves for 10 minutes, to exchange ideas.

      "bodyText": "It is 9.05am and I am in front of a classroom of 14 and 15 year olds at Fulham Cross girls school, west London. \"My name's Will Woodward and I work for the Guardian. You've just been reading Animal Farm, haven't you? What do you know about the character of Squealer?\" I write my name on the blackboard in shorthand and talk about that. Then I hand out newspaper cuttings about asylum seekers. This is the idea of Jim Grealy, the head of English: to get the class to write about asylum so that they have to deliberately manipulate the language, like Squealer did to create an impression. To deal with words like flood, tide, bogus and scrounger. Taking Grealy's advice, I set them to write quite a lot - three sides each in 55 minutes - in a newspaper style about asylum seekers. Failing to act on his advice, I talk for more than five minutes about what they should do. They get the idea but some look a bit confused. A few ask for help from their normal teacher, Sophia Steele, who is in the room but trying not to get involved. \"Sir, who is the head of the police?\" \"Sir, do you know what the capital of Sierra Leone is?\" \"Sir, who decides if asylum seekers can stay?\" The work they produce is very strong, but then this, the top set of the second oldest year, should be the easiest lesson I have all day. In a class where many are first- or second-generation immigrants, most write provocatively about asylum seekers, against the grain of their thinking. Jessica comes up with emotive words such as \"parasites\"; Diana writes of refugees coming to Britain on a \"luxury holiday package\". There are also powerful descriptions of why asylum seekers come to this country and how they are treated when they get here. After each girl reads out bits of their work, they clap each other. The lesson goes OK, not great. Sophia Steele says it was interesting, but that I should have got them talking a bit more at the beginning. \"It would have been good to give them 10 minutes to discuss it in groups, and then get feedback, and have a kind of discussion.\" As I walk into my next lesson, the chances of having any kind of discussion appears nil. The noise is somewhere between a football crowd and a pneumatic drill. This year-nine class have just started doing a topic on Aids. So, suggested Grealy, get them to write a story about someone with HIV or Aids. The prospect of saying condom in front of a group of 13-year-old girls does not fill me with unconfined joy. They know I'm not a proper teacher. I am here because someone at the Campaign for Learning thought it would be a good idea for me to see what teaching was like for a day. And this is a 25-strong, second-from-top set in English, and they have seen me coming. Robina is shouting and Nilofar is wrapping herself in a curtain. \"Please, don't do that,\" I say. \"Go away.\" \"Now c'mon, you need to get on with some work.\" Nilofar sits under her desk with her paper on her chair. \"It's better to work like this.\" In big letters she writes: \"I have Aids. Poo hoo hoo.\" \"Look! Look! Look at what Nilofar's done!\" says a girl whose surname is Attack. Lee chews gum, takes gum out, throws gum away, moves seats. \"I'm moving away from HER!\" she says before singing a song which ends with the phrase \"my skiddy knickers\". Robina won't turn round. \"I am turned round.\" Kayleigh only wants to speak to the class teacher, Letty Jackson. \"No. I want miss.\" \"Hey c'mon, c'mon. You really have got to get on with some work now or you're in trouble. You've got 25 minutes now . . . Oh, please don't, please don't.\" \"Sir, have you ever interviewed anyone famous?\" \"Sir, do you insinuate the truth and try and invent things that are really happening?\" Nilofar wraps herself in the curtain again. When do I intervene, and when do I let it go? And why does this remind me of the May Day riot? \"Sir, I've finished, I can't write any more.\" \"Where are you going?\" Most of the aggro comes from a row of four desks by the window, where Robina, Bianca, Lee and Nilofar are. Most of the others want to work, and many produce good writing, full of informed comment about the spread of Aids. \"Come on, you've only got eight minutes now.\" \"I'm reading HERS.\" \"Can you make more of an effort.\" \"Can you get Aids from masturbation?\" \"I don't know anything about Aids. I've never even had sex.\" \"How long do you have to wait for the result of an Aids test?\" \"Sssssh.\" \"What's the doctor in the Simpsons called? The crap one.\" \"Has anybody got any queries?\" \"QUEER-ies!! Ha ha!\" \"Why should I? It's not worth it.\" \"Can you put that money away, sorry.\" \"Can you turn round, Robina.\" \"I'll read it out for her!\" Cheneka, one of the disruptive pupils at the beginning, produces only half a page, but it's among the best. Maddening, really. Somebody writes: \"My life is a mess. Living La Vita Loca! Oui monsieur? I have Aids and I am very sad. I am a lesbian but people don't understand what I am going through. Thong Ta Tong To Tong. I am not your girlfriend anymore!\" And that's about it in an hour and a half. \"We had some really good discussion last week,\" says Jackson. \"But some of these girls are very, very attention-seeking and some of them have got very poor levels of concentration. \"You were trying in a very adult way to talk to them and reason with them, but unfortunately they are a group where sometimes I have to be extremely heavy-handed and shout at them - and I mean shout at them.\" At lunch in the canteen, the head teacher, Jan Cartwright, hands out tokens for free school dinners which go to more than 50% of pupils. She gets in to work at 6.15am every day. Heather Ballantine, the head of years 10 and 11, who sits with me as I peer into shepherd's pie, gets in at 7.15am. She tells me the biggest discipline problem they have these days is with text messages being sent on mobile phones. Six hundred girls aged 11 to 16 go to school here, from Fulham, Acton, Battersea, and Ladbroke Grove. Between them they speak 50 languages. Almost all of their very best pupils speak a different language at home. The school is full and it doesn't have to take on excluded pupils, and the last time Ofsted visited it got some criticism but plenty of praise, especially for English. It is not posh but it is serious and well-organised. Jim Grealy is with me for the last lesson. This is also year nine, doing the same topic, but the top set this time. \"Sir, your tie's all wrong,\" says Okite in the front row, and I could be about to get anxious again, but then something marvellous happens. I hand out more newspaper cuttings on Aids and HIV and make some points, and I get them to talk about it. I make the instructions crystal clear. Imagine you've just been to interview someone with HIV or Aids: what would they say? I don't bother putting my name up on the board in shorthand this time, too distracting. And I remember to let them talk between themselves for 10 minutes, to exchange ideas. They complain that I've asked them to write three pages, and occasionally they ask me questions, or get me to explain. And they connect, engage. It's like I've caught some kind of learning \"biting point\". I look up at the clock at 1.45pm and the room is completely quiet. They are all writing and I see how everyone is doing and I feel exhilarated. Good teachers must feel like this a lot. At least I hope they do. \"Are we writing for a tabloid or a broadsheet?\" \"Sir, can babies get Aids?\" \"That's brilliant.\" \"Thank you.\" \"How much do you get paid?\" Everyone writes a recognisable version of a newspaper interview. Some are uneven but all are laced with thought and empathy. They try out words like \"facade\" and \"deplorably\". Angie's character says: \"I was curious to know why God chose me out of all humans who seem to appear on this fragile earth.\" Suddaf's Aids patient says: \"I feel as though nearly everyone I see has an invisible dagger.\" And she rounds off with: \"I saw a brave, courageous man who wouldn't be beaten and would live a full life and accomplish his dreams.\" Grealy insists they wouldn't have been so well behaved if the lesson had been boring, but I am not sure. Some pupils stay behind to talk to me about how it went. \"I think your approach was different to a teacher,\" says Okite. \"Like when I was doing mine you said 'that starting bits all right but I would put in the middle, I would cheat a little bit'.\" They are nice about the lesson too. And it was fun. That last lesson was thrilling really, but just think of the responsibility, day in, day out. And as I rush on to get the bus home I feel a small but certain pang of relief in knowing I'm not coming back tomorrow to do it all over again.",

But indie luminary Kevin Smith's (pictured, centre) Clerks: The Animated Series - which premieres in the US this evening - is a programme with a difference. The project has a higher budget than the film it was based on (Clerks the film was financed via Smith's credit card, while the series has a budget of approximately $750,000 per episode), and its history is a chequered one. </p> <p>\"Way back in 1995,\" Smith explains, \"when we were working on Mallrats, someone told me that they'd read for a part in a Clerks sitcom. Apparently, Touchstone or Disney TV were developing a series with Warner Brothers. So they produced a pilot, which was abysmal, and the series never got aired. But then I approached CAA and Miramax and suggested the idea of a Clerks animated series. The Simpsons was the only prime-time animation series at the time and, when we pitched it to Fox, they seemed to think that The Simpsons was a 'one of a kind' show, and they didn't think that anything else would ever work in the same slot.\" </p> <p>Smith pauses, then laughs to himself as he continues: \"A few years passed and, by 1998, you couldn't move for prime-time animated shows. So we mentioned to Bob Weinstein at Miramax that we were developing an animated series based on Clerks, and that we'd done the Jay And Silent Bob comics. It was at this point that we got Dave Mandel on board, who'd written for Seinfeld. We brought him in as one of the executive producers and we came up with a concept for the show, which was like the movie reduced, and with some new elements thrown in.\" </p> <p>The show was then pitched to every US network (Warner Brothers, ABC, HBO, UPN), and won two offers: one to produce 12 episodes for UPN and another to make six for ABC. There were rumours that UPN wasn't going to last much longer, so it seemed the sensible thing for Smith to accept the ABC offer. </p> <p>Clerks: The Animated Series is the first real mainstream work that Smith has produced - on a big US network to boot - so he was very aware that the writing had to be less smutty and more subtle than usual. But this didn't cause him and his writing partners any real problems. </p> <p>\"Firstly, going to TV, you immediately lose the ability over here to swear and be overly vulgar and obscene\", he tells me, slightly regretfully. \"You have to be a lot more clever with it to get stuff past the censor and the network. You have to be subversive without being profane, which is a first for me. We're definitely using The Simpsons as our model. There'd be no sense in using South Park as our template because that show pushes the envelope on a cable station over here.\" </p> <p>Clerks was pushed around ABC's schedule, moved from an original broadcast date of March. And at one point View Askew, Smith's production company, were going to reclaim the copyright and re-edit the six episodes into a single animated film. Paul Dini, a producer of Batman animations, suggested they use a framing device, with Chris Rock as Uncle Remus, or make it a Tales From The Crypt-style anthology. But Smith wasn't happy with the fact that it would still look like a TV show, so he decided to leave it with ABC. After some pushing around, ABC decided on a broadcast date of May 31. </p> <p>Smith is convinced that this date is the kiss of death for the series: \"For me, May 31 pretty much ensures the show's failure. Essentially, it seems as if the network doesn't like the show. When they held test screenings in February in San Diego and Ohio, the audience didn't react very well to it. But the people who they used for the screenings had a key demographic missing: the 18 to 24-year-olds, who would be the people most likely to watch Clerks. It's insane.\" </p> <p>In the USA, launching a series during the summer is suicide: \"Very seldom does a show that debuts in the summer get picked up. Traditionally, the summer is when 25% of the audience is no longer watching.\" Ironically, ABC is owned by Disney, which makes it the second time - after the corporation effectively disowned his religious epic Dogma - that they have interfered with one of Smith's projects: \"I can't believe that we got fucked hard by the mouse twice in the span of a year.\" </p> <p>Taking a moment to compose himself, Smith calms down: \"There's really no pressure on us because at this point it's not as if we have to get good ratings to stay on, as we're not going to be coming back. Having said that, however it does on TV, you have to figure that the worst night would probably reach more people than most of our films have reached theatrically. Potentially, if we let it run on TV and receive some nice feedback, then maybe we can turn it into a feature with a viable box office prospect ahead of it. </p> <p>\"It remains to be seen whether or not we'll do that.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>It is the year 3000 and \"man-animals\" are scrabbling for survival in the lonely expanse of what the mighty Psychlos describe as \"this pitiful excuse for a planet\". It is also the year 2000 and a mere seven man-animals are scrabbling for their popcorn in the lonely expanse of one of the 3,307 cinemas in the US in which the sci-fi film Battlefield Earth has opened to spectacularly bad notices, many of which have suggested that the film is the worst of the year, the decade, the millennium or whatever exotic time-frame the alien Psychlos recognise. </p> <p>But it is not so much the poor reviews - after all, turkeys land in Hollywood as regularly as swallows in Capistrano - that have attracted attention so much as the provenance of the film and the stories attached to its purpose. The book on which the film is based is the 1984 science-fiction bestseller by L Ron Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology. Since the star, John Travolta, is also a Scientologist this has led to much fevered speculation about whether the film has a mission beyond that of the aliens to tame the man-animals. </p> <p>The film itself has taken the sort of critical battering that would make any galaxy implode. Mischievous technicians who worked on it have even put together a mock poster now circulating in Los Angeles bearing a selection of quotes: \"May well turn out to be the worst movie of this century\" (New York Times). \"A bloated sci-fi monstrosity!\" (Toronto Star). \"A million monkeys with a million crayons would be hard-pressed in a million years to create anything as cretinous as Battlefield Earth\" (Washington Post). </p> <p>So bad have the reviews been that people are now planning expeditions to see the film for its sheer awfulness and they will not be disappointed in what the New Yorker called \"this pitiful excuse for an entertainment, the Showgirls of sci-fi.\" The $75m film went into free-fall with a drop of 67% in box office receipts in its second week. Last weekend it took on average just over \u00a3200 per cinema - a tiny return. </p> <p>There is much speculation on what went wrong, since Travolta and the director, Roger Christian, who won an art direction Oscar for Star Wars in 1977 and was nominated for his work on Alien, have both done such spectacularly successful work in the past. Perhaps the planets were just in the wrong place. </p> <p>But the back-story had a separate life. This was a dastardly rumour started on the FACTNet website which, since 1994, has been producing anti-Scientology and anti-cult material from its home in Boulder, Colorado. FACTnet suggested that subliminal messages had been cunningly inserted by Scientologists to win over new converts to join the church, which now claims 8.5m members worldwide, around half of them in the US. </p> <p>This mischievous tale was repeated and became part of the chat around the film, much to the dismay of the Church of Scientology. FACTNet also claimed that Scientologists had helped to fund the film as part of a recruiting drive and that its members are under instructions to see the film at least three times so that it becomes a hit. </p> <p>Lawrence Wollersheim, who produces FACTNet with the help of volunteers is an ex-Scientologist who left the church - or was excommunicated, according to the Scientologists - in 1979. He has since been involved in many litigation battles with them. </p> <p>He said this week that he could give no evidence for his claims because the stories had all come from people whose identity he had to protect. He said he anticipated that the church would sue but said he had a \"bear-trap\" waiting for them if they did. </p> <p>He said his web-site was currently getting 200,000 hits a week and he is tickled that Hubbard's masterwork has turned out to be such a disaster on screen: \"they've choked their own golden goose.\" </p> <p>Warner Bros, the film's distributor, is familiar with the tales: \"we hear the rumblings, they are silly nonsense,\" said a spokesman this week. (The reviews have been unwelcome, however, and the film's sequel that would have covered the second half of the 1,040-page book is now \"up in the air\", according to Warner Bros.) </p> <p>The Church of Scientology is also very unhappy that the film based on its founder's best-seller should be the subject of such outlandish tales. It is anxious to put the record straight, saying that it did not pay for the funding of the movie nor are members under any instructions to see it. </p> <p>An initial inquiry by the Guardian about the origin of the rumours prompted no fewer than five different representatives of the church to contact us with offers of information and I am grateful to them for a better knowledge of Hubbard: \"Raised in the still-rugged frontier of Montana, he broke his first bronc and became the blood brother of a Blackfeet Indian medicine man by age six\"; of his honours and awards: Golden Tie Award (French National Federation of Culture), Author of the Century (Grijalbo-Mondadori); and of the book on which the film is based: 430,000 words long, 6m copies sold since publication in 1984, translated into 21 languages.

      "bodyText": "It is the year 3000 and \"man-animals\" are scrabbling for survival in the lonely expanse of what the mighty Psychlos describe as \"this pitiful excuse for a planet\". It is also the year 2000 and a mere seven man-animals are scrabbling for their popcorn in the lonely expanse of one of the 3,307 cinemas in the US in which the sci-fi film Battlefield Earth has opened to spectacularly bad notices, many of which have suggested that the film is the worst of the year, the decade, the millennium or whatever exotic time-frame the alien Psychlos recognise. But it is not so much the poor reviews - after all, turkeys land in Hollywood as regularly as swallows in Capistrano - that have attracted attention so much as the provenance of the film and the stories attached to its purpose. The book on which the film is based is the 1984 science-fiction bestseller by L Ron Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology. Since the star, John Travolta, is also a Scientologist this has led to much fevered speculation about whether the film has a mission beyond that of the aliens to tame the man-animals. The film itself has taken the sort of critical battering that would make any galaxy implode. Mischievous technicians who worked on it have even put together a mock poster now circulating in Los Angeles bearing a selection of quotes: \"May well turn out to be the worst movie of this century\" (New York Times). \"A bloated sci-fi monstrosity!\" (Toronto Star). \"A million monkeys with a million crayons would be hard-pressed in a million years to create anything as cretinous as Battlefield Earth\" (Washington Post). So bad have the reviews been that people are now planning expeditions to see the film for its sheer awfulness and they will not be disappointed in what the New Yorker called \"this pitiful excuse for an entertainment, the Showgirls of sci-fi.\" The $75m film went into free-fall with a drop of 67% in box office receipts in its second week. Last weekend it took on average just over \u00a3200 per cinema - a tiny return. There is much speculation on what went wrong, since Travolta and the director, Roger Christian, who won an art direction Oscar for Star Wars in 1977 and was nominated for his work on Alien, have both done such spectacularly successful work in the past. Perhaps the planets were just in the wrong place. But the back-story had a separate life. This was a dastardly rumour started on the FACTNet website which, since 1994, has been producing anti-Scientology and anti-cult material from its home in Boulder, Colorado. FACTnet suggested that subliminal messages had been cunningly inserted by Scientologists to win over new converts to join the church, which now claims 8.5m members worldwide, around half of them in the US. This mischievous tale was repeated and became part of the chat around the film, much to the dismay of the Church of Scientology. FACTNet also claimed that Scientologists had helped to fund the film as part of a recruiting drive and that its members are under instructions to see the film at least three times so that it becomes a hit. Lawrence Wollersheim, who produces FACTNet with the help of volunteers is an ex-Scientologist who left the church - or was excommunicated, according to the Scientologists - in 1979. He has since been involved in many litigation battles with them. He said this week that he could give no evidence for his claims because the stories had all come from people whose identity he had to protect. He said he anticipated that the church would sue but said he had a \"bear-trap\" waiting for them if they did. He said his web-site was currently getting 200,000 hits a week and he is tickled that Hubbard's masterwork has turned out to be such a disaster on screen: \"they've choked their own golden goose.\" Warner Bros, the film's distributor, is familiar with the tales: \"we hear the rumblings, they are silly nonsense,\" said a spokesman this week. (The reviews have been unwelcome, however, and the film's sequel that would have covered the second half of the 1,040-page book is now \"up in the air\", according to Warner Bros.) The Church of Scientology is also very unhappy that the film based on its founder's best-seller should be the subject of such outlandish tales. It is anxious to put the record straight, saying that it did not pay for the funding of the movie nor are members under any instructions to see it. An initial inquiry by the Guardian about the origin of the rumours prompted no fewer than five different representatives of the church to contact us with offers of information and I am grateful to them for a better knowledge of Hubbard: \"Raised in the still-rugged frontier of Montana, he broke his first bronc and became the blood brother of a Blackfeet Indian medicine man by age six\"; of his honours and awards: Golden Tie Award (French National Federation of Culture), Author of the Century (Grijalbo-Mondadori); and of the book on which the film is based: 430,000 words long, 6m copies sold since publication in 1984, translated into 21 languages. I also know more about Hubbard's time in Hollywood: he wrote the original story for the 1938 serial The Secret of the Treasure Island and worked on The Spider Returns, The Mysterious Pilot and The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickcock The church is anxious to slap down the FACTNet calumnies.

It would deal a devastating blow to the private health insurance industry, which relies heavily on people's fear of long waits for relief of grave and painful conditions.</p> <p>Health experts have convinced Mr Blair that the goal is achievable, given tough action to \"manage\" demand for hospital care and radical measures to tackle the worst queues for operations.</p> <p>A key plank of the strategy would be separation of non-urgent or elective surgery from emergency work, which at present always takes precedence. This could involve creation of special \"elective surgery centres\", dealing only with common procedures such as hip and knee replacements or cataract removal.</p> <p>Such centres could operate round the clock, seven days a week, and would employ nurse anaesthetists, operating assistants and other new types of staff to smash old established demarcations.</p> <p>Advisers to the prime minister and Alan Milburn, the health secretary, believe waiting lists and times could become a non-issue by the end of a second Labour term.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair is throwing his weight behind an audacious strategy that would in effect abolish NHS waiting lists, guaranteeing that no patient would wait more than three months for any treatment. The prime minister wants to unveil the goal as the centrepiece - the \"big idea\" - of the government's NHS Plan, to be set out in July. The ambitious strategy would rid the health service of its albatross image of interminable queueing. It would deal a devastating blow to the private health insurance industry, which relies heavily on people's fear of long waits for relief of grave and painful conditions. Health experts have convinced Mr Blair that the goal is achievable, given tough action to \"manage\" demand for hospital care and radical measures to tackle the worst queues for operations. A key plank of the strategy would be separation of non-urgent or elective surgery from emergency work, which at present always takes precedence. This could involve creation of special \"elective surgery centres\", dealing only with common procedures such as hip and knee replacements or cataract removal. Such centres could operate round the clock, seven days a week, and would employ nurse anaesthetists, operating assistants and other new types of staff to smash old established demarcations. Advisers to the prime minister and Alan Milburn, the health secretary, believe waiting lists and times could become a non-issue by the end of a second Labour term. Maximum waits could be cut first to six months and then to three. A wait of up to three months is broadly comparable to the rest of Europe; it is considered inadvisable on clinical grounds to aim for anything less in all but life-threatening cases. Stephen Thornton, chief executive of the NHS confederation, which represents health authorities and trusts, last night said an historic breakthrough was within reach. \"We are talking of nothing less than the end of queueing, which has been the Achilles heel that has beset the NHS since its beginning.\" The strategy is disclosed on \"NHS census day\", with 1m health workers and 1m patients today being asked to make their contribution to thinking on the NHS Plan. However, the public's top priority is already clear to ministers. Although people are concerned about dirty wards, inedible hospital food and lack of information about their care plans and progress, the overwhelming grievance is the wait to be treated. All that stands in the way of Mr Blair grasping the big idea is the Treasury: notwithstanding the unprecedented commitment to a 35% increase in NHS funds over the next four years, there is acute anxiety over the potential cost of a no-wait health service. Experience suggests that big cuts in waiting lists trigger surges in demand for treatment, as family doctors refer patients with long-term, \"grumbling\" conditions. In 1995, the then Conservative government succeeded in all but eliminating hospital waits of more than 12 months. But outpatient numbers soared 600,000 in a year as GPs made record referrals and, by the end of 1996, long waits had shot up again. According to the latest figures for England, 49,000 people have been waiting for treatment more than 12 months out of a total waiting list of just over 1m. The NHS confederation is warning the government that strong action would be needed to avoid an upsurge in patient referrals as waiting times fell. In an unpublished submission to the NHS Plan consultation, it says the first six months should be spent developing \"referral guidelines, scoring systems and structured methods of assessment\" for GPs. The confederation is backing the innovation of surgery centres and of specialist teams to be \"airlifted\" into areas running into problems. Influential advisers brought into the health department by Mr Milburn are also supporting the radical approach. But they know that there will be resistance from many hospital consultants with contracts under lengthy renegotiation. One solution would be to divide the consultants, offering surgeons and anaesthetists what the confederation calls \"very significant remuneration\" to work in the new surgery centres.",

As the NHS \"national plan\" takes shape, the government is on the verge of making a pledge to abolish queueing in the NHS within the next five years. It would be a pledge as surprising and unexpected as the ones promising full employment and the abolition of child poverty. A hot debate is in progress, with the Department of Health and Number 10 determined to go for it, and the Treasury digging in its heels. Understandably, the Treasury fears such a promise would be a constant gun to its head, forcing unknown sums for health year after year if the target looked as if it might not be met. But advocates of the pledge are growing. It would become the big idea the NHS national plan has been searching for until now. </p> <p>The prime minister is firmly in the driving seat of the national plan process, spending a great deal of his time each week on it. He is pushing ahead with this waiting list idea - once he's sure it can genuinely be done. What the prime minister wants he is likely to get, whatever the Treasury says. Visitors to him these days are regaled with detailed information about the myriad inefficiencies the NHS has lived with since its inception. He's inclined to say: \"Did you know some surgeons only do three operations a week, while others do 30? Did you know 40% of people referred to hospital outpatients never needed a consultant at all?\" The more the teams work away at the national plan, the clearer it becomes that unblocking the bottle-necks depends on doctors and nurses breaking down old professional demarcations. </p> <p>Today a census inside the entire NHS will ask each of the day's 1m patients and the 1m NHS staff to write down their \"top three things that would make the NHS better\". The results will be collated by a private firm within two weeks and handed to the 120-strong national plan committee and its all-inclusive task forces of NHS professionals. The government already knows what patients will say. Recent private polling reveals they say it's waiting, waiting and waiting, especially for cancer treatments and GP appointments. Dirty wards and inedible hospital food rank high, but waiting comes first, second and third. </p> <p>Could it be done? One of the chief promoters of the idea is Stephen Thornton, head of the NHS confederation. In five years? Easy, he says, it could take less than five years if the national plan is radical enough when it's published in July. What would it take? First, abandon the nonsensical target of cutting total waiting lists, one of Labour's worst manifesto mistakes. Who cares how many others wait, all that matters is how long they wait. Waiting time will be cut at first to a six-month maximum. After that everyone will get a guaranteed booked appointment in three months - and that effectively counts as abolition, in line with most of Europe. (So long as cancer and urgent cases are dealt with at once, others should be left a little while before operating as conditions can improve or patients change their minds.) How could it be done? It needs a radical break with the past and total restructuring of the professions. </p> <p>One idea is to create new surgery units, with highly paid surgeons contracted for nothing but routine waiting list operations, with no danger of operations cancelled or beds purloined: emergency cases go to other units. New sub-consultant grades would do simpler operations, something the BMA strongly resists. The danger is that when waiting lists fall, GPs just refer more borderline cases to hospitals, sometimes with vague referral notes asking a consultant to \"please advise on this case\". That will have to stop. The new primary care groups into which all GPs are now grouped to purchase hospital services for their patients will have to control who they refer, conducting their own lab tests first and hiring their own specialists for minor operations, cutting down hospital referrals. </p> <p>Hanging over all this, though, is the consultants' contract which has been in slow renegotiation for a year and a half. Tomorrow the BMA consultants committee meets in London for its annual conference, where the vexed question of the contract will be hotly debated. If the government is lucky there may be a new division between the surgeons (who have much private practice) and the majority who work very hard almost exclusively within the NHS. The waiting list promise will require deft handling of the doctors: no use precipitating rebellion. Yet something has to be done about the absurdity of the present contract that allows key surgeons to spend too much time on private work despite virtually full NHS pay. Can the government walk the tightrope of reforming the contract, getting more work out of the underperforming doctors and yet keep them enthused about the national plan? </p> <p>The shocking survey by John Yates published in the Health Service journal will strengthen the government's arm - and may incense many other NHS consultants. It found supposedly full-time orthopaedic surgeons on average conducted only 6.4 operations a week taking just seven hours. They do fewer than 10 years ago, though the numbers of orthopaedic surgeons has nearly doubled. They control their long waiting lists: as a result hips, knees and other bones are the most sought after private operations. The report concludes no more orthopaedic surgeons be appointed until existing ones increase their NHS work to at least four sessions a week lasting three and a half hours each. Hardworking consultants without private practice are growing increasingly restive at being tarred with the same brush. Divide and rule may be the government strategy, but it could be a hard battle. Abolishing waiting lists will kill most private practice. </p> <p>When the prime minister announced the largest increase the NHS has ever had, many insiders saw it as the last desperate chance for the NHS. Every newspaper (bar the Guardian and Mirror) was openly advocating privatisation in one form another. On television Tory shadow health minister Philip Hammond advocated an NHS for emergencies only, with private insurance for everything else. As average incomes rise fast, seductive brochures for private hospitals might woo too many people away, leaving the NHS a poor service for the poor. That is why Blair went for the things patients care about most, creating NHS Direct, high street clinics and booked operation appointments. If waiting is really abolished then the NHS will be saved. However, it is such an astonishing leap there's a danger that it will simply not be believed, in the same way that Labour's sceptical heartlands seem to disregard those other radical promises on child poverty and full employment. Time to abandon third way mumble and let Labour rhetoric match its most radical plans. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com </a></p>",

Musician John Hodkin - who is about to cycle 1,000 miles around the East Midlands with his tuba giving impromptu concerts three times a day - has been experimenting on bovines before he subjects humans to the sound of the maligned musical instrument. But the cows are not half as perplexed as the good folk of Rossendale, Lancashire, where vegetarian artist John Spedding has been toying with making sculptures from black pudding and tripe, big delicacies in Rawtenstall market. These are two of wackier happenings during the Year of the Artist, when more than 1,000 artists, writers and musicians will bring art to the places art does not usually reach. But the strangest project for a \u00a35m series of residencies, partly funded by Coca-Cola, is Gavin Turk's brainwave to bring Che Guevara back from the grave to start a revolution by storming Shoreditch town hall in London's East End. \"I haven't worked out who should be in my band of merry men yet,\" Turk said. \"But I will be Che, and we will be true to the spirit of Citizen Smith.\" The Year of the Artist began yesterday with the unveiling of a nine-foot twitching head of John Humphrys, presenter of BBC Radio 4's Today, and a man prone to ask \"But is it art?\" with regularity. Richard Kriel, who will spend the year with Radio 1, and performance poet Attila the Stockbroker, who has been commissioned to read a new verse before every Brighton and Hove Albion home game, will probably reach the biggest audience. Kriel hopes to perfect his \"laser cannon\", which picks out individuals in huge crowds and beams music straight at them. For once spending in the regions far outstrips the capital, with nearly \u00a3500,000 being spent in the north-west alone, com pared to London's \u00a3172,000.

      "body": "<p>Nearly 140 years after it was founded to help house the poor of London, the Peabody Trust has on its books a surprising group of the new poor: young, qualified professionals who can't afford flats close to their jobs in the inner city.</p> <p>The group - nurses, junior hospital doctors, teachers and computer staff - will be Peabody tenants for just a few years, till they move up the housing ladder. But so long as low starting salaries in the public sector are outpaced by rising house prices, there will be key employees needing help at the start of their careers. </p> <p>The trust is devising new projects and offering new types of tenancy. Hi-tech blocks are rising in worn-out bits of London, outshining the drab barrack-like estates that once were the flagships of the Peabody empire. In Newington Green, there's a development combining flats, shops and a GP's surgery; in Hackney, 30 apartments in Murray Grove have been designed for young professionals on modest incomes who don't qualify for social housing but are struggling to rent. And the trust's biggest venture is just starting at Kensal Green: 300 homes on a mixed tenure scheme, offering social rented, cost rent, shared ownership and outright sale. </p> <p>This smart new face of Peabody comes after decades when the trust kept a low profile, preoccupied with repairing and refurbishing its ageing stock of 17,000 homes, many built a century ago. </p> <p>Peabody estates have been part of drab streetscapes for so long that we hardly notice them. Tidy but dull, there's rarely any litter or graffiti, just an indelible whiff of Victorian do-goodery - and the name of the eponymous founder on the side of the buildings. </p> <p>George Peabody (1795-1869), the Anglophile American philanthropist, wasn't concerned with the rock-bottom destitute when he donated \u00a3500,000 to help the poor. The charity he set up was part of the enlightened impulse to combat insanitary slums and chronic disease in industrialised London by improvements in public health and model housing. Peabody chose to focus on industrious artisans who were a couple of rungs up the ladder. Tenants had to be in work and able to pay rent, which in turn was used to build yet more flats. </p> <p>The first dwellings, opened in Spitalfields in 1864, were pretty basic. A family would be allocated two or three rooms, one with a range for cooking. Bathrooms, laundry and drying rooms were provided communally on the top floor of the building, and the flat roof above this was used for drying clothes in summer and as a playground - a necessity as most Peabody properties were located in crowded inner boroughs. </p> <p>Expansion was always steady, with the income from the endowment and from rents gradually making Peabody one of the biggest housing charities in Britain. The schemes were always worthy rather than innovative. For instance, Peabody had been active for 50 years before it got round to erecting self-contained flats, in 1912-14. And the big rebuilding programme necessary after bomb damage in the last war followed traditional lines; no imaginative housing schemes were tried in the late 1940s and 50s. </p> <p>In that same period, the rise of the welfare state overshadowed the work of the trust. The present director of development, Dickon Robinson, says that this downturn in the trust's standing was because \"people were saying, 'I believe in rights, not charity'. The trust was unfashionable and out of steam.\" </p> <p>And so it remained till a new directorate took over - Robinson was part of it - and realised that the 1998 housing act allowed charities to raise private finance to expand. The trust started to regenerate itself and decided its aims - to fight poverty - needed to be updated. Staff became involved with projects to aid rough sleepers in the 1980s. It was realised also that the recession had robbed many tenants of their jobs, so training for employment was taken on. </p> <p>Economic changes in London in the 1990s created a new set of potential tenants: young, low-paid professionals - the update of George Peabody's original artisans. Nurses and junior doctors from St Bartholomew's and the Royal London hospitals are among the first to be helped. In partnership with the hospitals, Peabody's came up with a scheme in Stratford, east London, to provide 96 units, most for NHS staff. </p> <p>Less visible than those who keep the capital's services pulsing along, but vital to its economy, are the one-person start-up businesses in craft, design and new media. For them, affordable space to live and work in has been conjured up at Westferry on the Isle of Dogs. All 27 units are ready, but are being let in batches, so there are neighbours with know-how to help the newer arrivals, and gradually build a community. </p> <p>Just the right spot for Robin Greene, a Royal College of Art graduate who's about to launch his own fashion label. Greene reckons it would be hard to beat the package he's been offered: around 700 sq ft of space for \u00a3800 a month. That's about what he would pay for renting separate work and living quarters, he reckons. </p> <p>In addition, the East London Small Business Centre (in partnership with Peabody) has approved the business plan he was required to submit, and will offer expert advice over the three years of his tenancy. </p> <p>With so many different projects targeted at employed groups, or different ways of renting or sharing ownership, Peabody is rolling in debt: its managers and directors are actually delighted that it owes \u00a3300m, because it's a sign of vitality. \"George Peabody wouldn't have wanted us to sit on our assets,\" says Robinson. </p> <p>The trust generates an annual income of \u00a357m, owns property worth \u00a31.8bn, and its commercial portfolio is worth \u00a313m, with the income used to further its charitable work. As well as the homes it has built, the trust is taking over more estates from London boroughs, acquring 2,000 council dwellings last year. </p> <p>The profile of Peabody people is changing. On the long-established estates, most tenants come via councils, but they're strictly vetted. Robinson says: \"We try not to take local authority tenants who have a history of rent arrears.\" </p> <p>How are Peabody and council estates different? \"To go back 20 years, there was a very strong thrift ethic on our estates,\" says Robinson. \"Paying the rent would have been very important.\" </p> <p>Fred Calcott, who has lived on the Palmer's estate in north London for 30 years with his wife, and brought up their children there, agrees. \"There's something about Peabody that makes them different from council estates.\" </p> <p>Partly, it's participation by tenants. \"Tenants' liaison committees can talk directly to the Peabody governors, to the letting managers, the housing managers,\" he says. </p> <p>The Peabody empire is not immune from the problems which dominate council housing departments; more vulnerable tenants are coming on to their books.

      "bodyText": "As urban myths go, this was one that had everything ... a world famous actress being turned away from a struggling tourist attraction because no one recognised her. In a week during which the Millennium Dome lost its chairman and admitted there was no chance of meeting its 12m visitors target, it faced further humiliation yesterday. The troubled project announced it had been forced to turn away Michelle Pfeiffer during February when it was sold out for 11 days in succession. A dome official was so aghast at missing a golden chance to attract a member of the glitterati that he offered a grovelling apology to the actress and the promise of free admission for her and her two children when she next attempted a visit. But now the dome has been forced to apologise again after Ms Pfeiffer's agent insisted the actress had not gone anywhere near the dome. The dome company had over-reacted when it seized upon a report on Heart FM radio's celebrity gossip show which told of Ms Pfeiffer's disappointment at being refused entry when she and her children turned up as ordinary members of the public. The company then spent a frantic day trying to make up for the slight and invited her to visit the attraction to add a touch of glamour. But by close of business last night, the New Millennium Experience Company was forced into a hasty retreat after a publicist for the 43-year-old actress flatly denied that she or her children, Claudia Rose and John Henry, had been anywhere near the building. Ms Pfeiffer was in London to promote the film The Story of Us, but, according to her spokesman, spent less than 24 hours in the city, was not accompanied by her children, and had certainly not been in the vicinity of the dome. Last night Heart FM, having confessed to being the source of the gossip, apologised for any inconvenience.",

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development sounded its note of caution about the hype surrounding the New Economy by arguing that there is no hard evidence for its existence outside the US. While keeping an open mind about the potential impact of new technology in the rest of the world, the OECD said other countries could not expect to copy the US's success simply by buying more computers. In its twice-yearly Economic Outlook, the OECD said information and communication technology had played an important part in boosting labour productivity growth in the US, especially during the mid-1990s.

However, the Paris-based organisation said there was little direct evidence that firms in the economy as a whole were using computer technology to full effect, although there were signs that businesses were reorganising production and distribution. Turning to the impact of new technology on the performance of other industrialised countries, the OECD said: \"Evidence that greater use of information and communication technology has raised productivity growth rates outside the United States significantly is limited.\" In the Nordic countries, where ICT use was comparable or even greater than in the United States, and more intensive than in most other countries, there was some some evidence that labour productivity growth was increasing.

BMW said the plant would be located near the old Goodwood motor racing track, close to the racecourse shown above with a bevy of Rolls-Royces gracing the car park during the 1960s.The Earl of March (right), who helped broker the choice of location, holds an annual festival of speed at the old motor racing track site. It is also less than 10 miles from West Wittering, where Sir Henry Royce, one of the co-founders of the luxury brand, lived and worked. Most of the staff will be drawn from the surrounding area which, BMW said, is rich in specialist craft skills used in the yacht and motor industries. Still smarting from the accusations of betrayal when it abandoned its effort to rebuild Rover, BMW said the Goodwood area offered a combination of the heritage of racing and motorsport and was \"quintessentially English\". Karl-Heinz Kalbfell, the managing director of the project, said the region was the most suitable location, close to Heathrow and Gatwick airports as well as to London. It was chosen in preference to Cowley, Oxford, where BMW will build the new Mini; Crewe, the traditional Rolls-Royce home; and west London. The new company aimed to retain the marque in its originalstyle.",

      "bodyText": "The rightwing historian David Irving, who owes more than \u00a31m in legal costs from his failed Holocaust libel case in London earlier this year, has arrived in California to start a three-month fundraising tour of the United States. At the weekend he met at a secret location in Orange county a group dedicated to proving that there was no mass extermination of Jews during the second world war. The meeting of the Institute for Historical Review was attended by 140 people, including the former Republican congressman Pete McCloskey and a number of rightwing academics and supporters, and watched by 2,500 others around the world via the internet. The head of the organisation, Mark Weber, told the Los Angeles Times: \"Of the 16 or 17 speakers here this weekend, six have been punished as 'thought criminals' with imprisonment, court order fines or travel bans for publicly expressing dissident views on history. \"We are often asked why we seem obsessed with the Holocuast. The answer is very simple ... Our own political, social and intellectual leaders have made the fate of Europe's Jews during world war two a central icon to our age. \"No comparable attention is given to the tens of millions of other world war two victims, including the many millions of Chinese who perished.\" Mr Weber said that because of the \"Holocaust cult\", it was often forgotten that millions of Russians had died, as had 12m to 14m Germans. He said that American history was told from a Jewish perspective. Mr Irving said that he was appealing against his defeat in the libel action he brought against Professor Deborah Lipstadt, who had accused him of anti-semitism. In his decision, Judge Charles Gray said that Prof Lipstadt had been justified in her attack on Mr Irving, and his chances in an appeal are thought to be slim. Local Jewish groups expressed dismay at Mr Irving's presence, although one described him as \"a freak at a sideshow\" and said that he had been so discredited in the libel case that his views now carried little weight. They said that under the first amendemnt he was guaranteed the right to free speech in the United States, but he would be essentially \"preaching to his own choir\". Mr Irving accused his opponents of spending around $6m in their attempts to defeat him in court. \"It's sad to say in the battle between David and Goliath, David doesn't always win. But I think I can say in this particular battle David is going to win and the victory is going to be sweet when it comes.\" He portrayed himself as the underdog fighting against insurmountable odds. There is a large network of wealthy rightwing sympathisers on a well-travelled circuit who will await Irving in the next three months. He will be portrayed as a victim of political correctness and a free speech martyr. There is also a large network of Jewish groups in California who are likely to be unhappy to discover that Mr Irving is promoting his views in their area. There have been a number of anti-semitic attacks in California, not least that carried out last year by a member of a neo-fascist group, who opened fire in a Jewish community centre.

      "bodyText": "Bankruptcy officials have received dramatic new evidence, which they are believed to be investigating, that Jonathan Aitken - the disgraced former cabinet minister who claims to be virtually penniless - had a secret Swiss bank account into which $4m was deposited by a Saudi prince. Evidence of the existence of this account, at the Lausanne branch of Credit Suisse, has led to the postponement of an agreement that Aitken had hoped to make with his credi tors to escape from bankruptcy without paying much of the debt he owes from his failed libel action. Since he declared himself bankrupt, Aitken's affairs have been under investigation by trustees in bankruptcy, accountants responsible to the Official Receiver. It can be a criminal offence to conceal assets. The fresh evidence about a Swiss account reached the accountancy firm Baker Tilly last week, when the main creditors - the Guardian, Granada TV and the Inland Revenue - were considering an offer from Aitken of \u00a31.7m towards legal costs and other liabilities totalling more than \u00a33m. This followed the reported earlier discovery that Aitken has also secretly moved more than \u00a3500,000, from the proceeds of selling a house, from Britain into a bank account in Monaco. It is now understood that detailed evidence has been obtained, from financial sources involved in the Credit Suisse transaction, that the $4m was moved out of an account belonging to the king's son Prince Mohammed at the Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi in the Saudi town of Al-Khobar, and into an Aitken-controlled Swiss account in April 1995, shortly after the cabinet minister embarked on his ill-fated libel action. Last night, after denials from Aitken, the prince's business manager, Said Ayas, was asked by the Guardian about the transactions. He confirmed how they had taken place in a statement through his City solicitor, Adam Greaves of Rakisons: \"Prince Mohammed _ paid $4m into a bank account with the Lausanne branch of Credit Suisse _ with the intention that they be used to pay Jonathan Aitken's legal fees in fighting his libel action.\" The true ownership of the account was hidden behind the name of Fides - a small firm of Lausanne accountants that Aitken regularly used for business transactions, and which had originally acted for his wife Lolicia, who had Swiss commercial interests in Lausanne, where she grew up. Fides set up the separate account as nominees on the Aitkens' behalf specifically to receive the money. The code name chosen to identify the account was WAVIC 332771- 02-1. The letters represented the names of the Aitkens' three children, William, Alexandra and Victoria. The money would subsequently have been moved out again into other accounts. Such elaborate procedures would enable Aitken to deny that he or his wife had any accounts in their own names at Credit Suisse, or that they currently have an interest in accounts there. The Guardian and Granada TV were targets of the costly libel action by Aitken after they exposed his financial links with Prince Mohammed, and the fact that he had lied about a 1993 visit to the Ritz in Paris while he was a minister in the Conservative government. He had been meeting Prince Mohammed to offer him lucrative secret arms sales commissions. Aitken later served a seven-month jail term for perjury after his libel suit collapsed. Aitken and Prince Mohammed met in Geneva at the time of the Guardian publication, Saudi sources say. Apparently incensed by the tone of the articles, the billionaire prince appears to have funded Aitken handsomely to sue. As a self-declared bankrupt Aitken was under an obligation to provide the trustee with details of all his assets. He was also ordered to disclose his bank accounts for the libel trial. The only overseas bank account he has ever declared was one with Chase Manhattan, in New York. When he declared himself bankrupt in May last year Aitken said he had assets of only \u00a340,000. He claimed that his \u00a32m family home in Lord North Street, central London, belonged to his divorced wife and that his \u00a3500,000 former constituency home in Sandwich, Kent, also belonged to her because it was bought with money from her family. Under normal bankruptcy procedure, the Official Receiver will have been informed by the bankruptcy trustees of the allegations of non-disclosure. Contacted at home by the Guardian yesterday, Aitken said in a statement through his secretary that he intended to fax an explanation of the Swiss account to Baker Tilly. \"Because of the confidentiality requirements on him Mr Aitken cannot divulge the contents of his letter,\" the statement said. It added: \"Your story of him having any ac count at Credit Suisse Lausanne is untrue.\" In fact, although the bankruptcy trustees are bound to keep the bankrupt's affairs confidential, Mr Aitken himself is perfectly free to give a public explanation of his Swiss dealings.

Pressure has been mounting on Germany to allow foreign parents involved in \"tug-of-love\" cases with Germans to have the kind of access rights permitted in many other European countries and the US. Mr Schr\u00f6der plans to announce a series of reforms this week in an attempt to pre-empt a diplomatic rift with Washington over the issue, the Washington Post reported yesterday. The measures were agreed at a special meeting of the German cabinet last week. The central issue is the consistent refusal of German courts to allow foreign parents to have normal access rights to visit or receive visits from their children if the German parent opposes such a move. Lady Catherine Meyer, wife of the British ambassador to Washington, started campaigning on the issue after her two children from her first marriage to a German doctor were abducted by their father. Since the abduction in 1994 the German courts have allowed Lady Meyer - who has lobbied Hillary Clinton and Cherie Blair for support - to see her sons for only 24 hours. A lobby of American parents involved in similar custody battles has forced Congress to take up the issue. The parents complain that Germany, far more than any other western democracy, imposes insurmountable barriers on foreign parents in such cases.

      "body": "<p>The first that Tony Blair's spin doctors heard of Laura Spence's university plans was on May 22 when sharp-eyed members of the Cabinet Office's media monitoring unit spotted an \"Oxford Snubs North Talent\" headline splashed over the Newcastle Journal.</p> <p>By the time they circulated the newspaper cutting to the daily media strategy meeting, 8.30am in the press secretary's office at No 10, the man who chairs the meeting, Alastair Campbell, had already spotted the story in that day's Daily Mail.</p> <p>From their very different perspectives on educational opportunity, both the Mail and New Labour saw its political potential. Both have long campaigned against \"snooty\" Oxbridge colleges whose admission panels carelessly reject talented kids from comprehensives.</p> <p>But once Gordon Brown, the chancellor, had let rip in a speech last Thursday against the \"scandal\" of Laura's rejection, the government was accused of engaging in class warfare.</p> <p>Class warfare is very old Labour, but it lurks just below New Labour's meritocratic surface, along with the hunch - yet to be proved - that heartland voters like it too. So there was clearly opportunism in Labour's attack.</p> <p>Labour meritocrats in industry and the civil service were scandalised, as were leftwing Oxbridge dons who have fought for greater access but nurse unease that the grammar and direct grant schools which nursed their own talents were purged by Labour in the past.</p> <p>Ministers were ready for the reaction and did not flinch. The campaign was quickly carried forward by Robin Cook (Edinburgh University) to John Prescott (11-plus failure, Hull University and Ruskin).</p> <p>Brown has campaigned for greater educational opportunity since he was a precocious student radical at Edinburgh University. But he may have had a further motive for last week's attack.

      "bodyText": "The first that Tony Blair's spin doctors heard of Laura Spence's university plans was on May 22 when sharp-eyed members of the Cabinet Office's media monitoring unit spotted an \"Oxford Snubs North Talent\" headline splashed over the Newcastle Journal. By the time they circulated the newspaper cutting to the daily media strategy meeting, 8.30am in the press secretary's office at No 10, the man who chairs the meeting, Alastair Campbell, had already spotted the story in that day's Daily Mail. From their very different perspectives on educational opportunity, both the Mail and New Labour saw its political potential. Both have long campaigned against \"snooty\" Oxbridge colleges whose admission panels carelessly reject talented kids from comprehensives. But once Gordon Brown, the chancellor, had let rip in a speech last Thursday against the \"scandal\" of Laura's rejection, the government was accused of engaging in class warfare. Class warfare is very old Labour, but it lurks just below New Labour's meritocratic surface, along with the hunch - yet to be proved - that heartland voters like it too. So there was clearly opportunism in Labour's attack. Labour meritocrats in industry and the civil service were scandalised, as were leftwing Oxbridge dons who have fought for greater access but nurse unease that the grammar and direct grant schools which nursed their own talents were purged by Labour in the past. Ministers were ready for the reaction and did not flinch. The campaign was quickly carried forward by Robin Cook (Edinburgh University) to John Prescott (11-plus failure, Hull University and Ruskin). Brown has campaigned for greater educational opportunity since he was a precocious student radical at Edinburgh University. But he may have had a further motive for last week's attack. Labour MPs blame him for the backlash against the 75p pension rise, \"our worst mistake so far, far worse than the Dome,\" one said yesterday. So the chancellor, a formidable populist when he bothers to be, had no scruple about using Laura's case to contrast his vision of \"opportunity for all\" - jobs, welfare, health, education - with what Labour strategists see as the Tory leader William Hague's defence of privilege and the old school tie. Blair, who sees himself as a Fettes/Oxford rebel, contemptuous of \"Old Brit\" snobberies and traditions, did not reprimand Brown over his speech, contrary to weekend reports. Labour's interest in attacking what remains of Oxbridge social exclusivity pre-dates the Laura Spence case. David Blunkett gave the Association of University Teachers' conference the same message in calmer terms on May 10. His remarks were addressed to the 10 top universities which take only 5% under-privileged students (the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology goes out and finds 30%). Citing the much-admired missionary work of the Sutton trust, run by self-made millionaire Peter Lampl, Mr Blunkett said \"a just and prosperous\" society needed to do more to get \"young people from the lower socio-economic groups into higher education\". Currently 17% make it, compared with 45% from non-manual groups. Mr Blunkett mentioned Oxbridge only in his final passage. \"I welcome measures taken by leading universities, including Oxford and Cambridge ... but there is much more we can do together,\"| he said. The speech garnered virtually no publicity. Mr Blunkett is said to feel Mr Brown could have been more diplomatic too, but it was the chancellor who got the issue up and running. Mr Brown spends summer holidays in the US, often at Harvard which he has seen transform itself in the 25 years he has known it from \"a finishing school for elites\" into a genuinely open home for excellence from all classes. As an exponent of a skills economy he believes Britain needs all its talents. Rightly or wrongly, Labour believes that it can benefit from signs that Hague is finally getting the Tory act together. Tony Blair and Brown are united in believing that Margaret Thatcher benefited from good enemies - Arthur Scargill, General Galtieri of Argentina and Michael Foot - who helped define her. They think that the Laura Spence case makes clear their forthcoming campaign themes - \"opportunity for all\" and the \"many not the few\". They think that senior Tories look embarrassed defending Oxbridge on TV. Tory MPs believe that \"aspirational\" Britain agrees with them. Polling day will show who is right.",

Twenty-six drug users in Glasgow and 14 in Dublin have contracted the illness; 18 of them have died. In Glasgow the illness emerged early this month, with 17 of the 26 cases affecting women and eight women being among the 12 dead. All are believed to have injected heroin direct into muscle tissue and have suffered severe inflammation around the site of the injection. The Dublin cases have followed a similar pattern as far as the illness is concerned, but most of the victims have been men. Health officials in Glasgow said they had spoken to their Irish counterparts and concluded that the two outbreaks were likely to have the same cause. Last week tests at the chemical warfare research centre in Porton Down, Wiltshire, ruled out anthrax, which scientists had suggested as the cause of the Glasgow outbreak. American specialists have been called in to help the investigations in both cities.

One theatre manager listens politely and then declines on the grounds that he has already booked a Chekhov play. He really wouldn't, he explains, want two dramas within a few weeks of each other. \"But you're a theatre,\" responds Tackley despairingly. </p> <p>A couple of hundred miles up the road, Tim Highman of English Touring Theatre is selling his show. \"We have a new production starring Prunella Scales,\" he tells one venue manager. \"Oh, I'll definitely take that.\" \"Don't you want to know what the play is?\" asks Highman. \"If it's got Prunella Scales in it, that's good enough for me.\" Chekhov's Cherry Orchard, with Scales as Madame Ranevskaya, is duly booked. </p> <p>A couple of years ago, Mike Alfreds, the veteran figure who runs the touring company Method and Madness, got together a group of venue managers to find out what they wanted. \"Shakespeare?\" he asked. \"No, there's too much,\" came the reply. \"New plays?\" \"Too hard to sell.\" \"So,\" said Alfreds, despairingly, \"what do you want?\" \"It is not our job to tell you what we want - we just know what we don't want.\" </p> <p>For all his experience in the touring sector, Alfreds never did find out what they wanted. A year ago this month, Method and Madness ceased to tour, three years into an ambitious project to create a repertoire of work with a permanent ensemble. Alfreds admits that the company could no longer persuade enough venues to take its work. </p> <p>This is not a story of villainous theatre managers unable to recognise a good thing when it is stuck under their noses, or of poor hard-done touring companies that only produce brilliant work. Anyone who saw Method and Madness's abysmal Cherry Orchard two years ago will know this is not the case. But it is the story of an often ignored, certainly underfunded and distinctly unglamorous sector of theatre that is in crisis. </p> <p>It is a crisis that the Arts Council seems to be only belatedly recognising and for which it is partly responsible. In last week's response to the Boyden report on the state of British theatre, the Arts Council's Next Stage document speaks of the need for \"further development of the Arts Council's national touring policy, and in particular the refinement of its approach to touring drama.\" </p> <p>But there are many in the sector who would question whether it has had any kind of constructive approach to touring drama in recent years. The fact that Method and Madness has been mothballed for a year, producing nothing, its lottery-funded offices barely used, while its board takes a leisurely decision on its future seems at odds with The Next Stage's concern that over a six-year period funding for nationally touring companies has resulted in 24% fewer performances and 13% fewer workshops, leading to a 28% decrease in audiences. </p> <p>Method and Madness is one of the three touring companies funded by the Arts Council's drama department (the others are English Touring Theatre and Oxford Stage Company). The fact that it has produced no work for a year may have played as big a part in the decline in audiences as the standstill funding that has put all these companies under intense pressure. The Arts Council, however, maintains that it is up to the board of Method and Madness to decide its future, however long that may take. </p> <p>But there is something even odder going on. The Arts Council talks about a \"significant reduction in the number of tours\", yet ask almost any company that tours on the middle scale, and with the exception of Theatre de Complicite, which could probably book a tour of Roget's Thesaurus without any trouble, all sigh about the increasingly difficult task of getting venues to take their work. </p> <p>In part this is because, as Tish Francis of Oxford Playhouse says, \"We have been both expanding what we offer our audiences and trying to extend that audience itself. Diversity is the key word.\" That's not a problem at a venue such as the Playhouse because of its good reputation and proximity to London. It can take its pick of touring drama and is part of what Dominic Dromgoole of Oxford Stage Company calls the \"Harvey Nichols touring circuit\", a select bunch of well-run, upmarket venues such as Oxford and Malvern that will get good audiences and make money. </p> <p>Elsewhere, as Dromgoole points out, diversity can simply mean that \"you are up against shite that is more commercial than you are. It is hard to put a Robert Holman play up against Murder at the Vicarage. </p> <p>It is not just companies that have been hit. As touring costs have risen, some venues, particularly in the north, are no longer able to afford decent touring productions. And so the places visited by the major companies have taken on a distinctly southern bias. The idea of tours filling the gaps in the regional rep network is a fiction. </p> <p>Tim Highman also points out that while a policy of diversity may bring new audiences into the theatres, it doesn't always bring them in for drama. \"If your play is the only drama programmed that season, you have to build an audience from scratch every time you turn up in that venue.\" English Touring Theatre's solution has been an extensive education and outreach programme. </p> <p>But it is not just from the commercial sector that the touring companies have been feeling the squeeze. A few years back, seeing a gap in the market, the Almeida, the Donmar, the RSC and the National and some regional reps leapt in. The result is an overcrowded market where touring companies are squeezed out of prime venues by others whose main subsidy is for their building-based work. </p> <p>The Arts Council's Next Stage recognises that there is a problem and that touring can't be looked at in isolation but must be seen in a broader context of regional theatre. It also suggests that there must be a more constructive relationship between the touring companies and the regional reps, some of which have occasionally demonstrated a \"Get off my patch\" mentality. </p> <p>Yet before the Arts Council takes action there are signs that the companies themselves are taking the initiative. Oxford Stage Company's London residencies have attracted criticism, but the company has not shirked its commitment to touring. English Touring Company has an educational programme second to none. </p> <p>Tish Francis thinks that the Arts Council must respond more quickly to the changing needs of touring, while Dominic Dromgoole argues that theatre, particularly regional touring, is mired in a culture in which \"everything is impossible\". He prefers to think that everything is possible. \"After all, what's the point of touring unless you think it's fun? The great thing about a touring show is that it is always an event. The production never settles.\" </p> <p>Rachel Tackley agrees: \" Touring is the sexiest place to be. You can play to a bunch of 16-year-olds in one place and to greying old ladies in the next.

A dramatic hero can easily present two faces: one to the characters, another to the audience. But the singular fact about Speer is the masked nature of his whole existence. His confession of guilt at the Nuremberg trials in 1946 appears like a skilled tactical manoeuvre; and even when, at the end of his life, he admits in an affidavit to his \"tacit acceptance of the persecution and murder of millions of Jews\" he queries the precise translation of \"tacit acceptance\", prevaricating to the last. </p> <p>In her 750-page biography of Speer, Gitta Sereny has the freedom to question his every statement, to pore over every scrap of evidence. David Edgar has no such luxury in the three-and-a-half-hour play he has fashioned from the book for the National Theatre. He can present Speer through his own and other people's eyes but he cannot deal in the minutiae of scholarship. While I broadly welcome Edgar's attempt to restore public issues and events to our increasingly privatised stage, I also think his play raises an acute aesthetic problem. How do you encompass the evils of Nazism? Through fact? Through fiction? Or through a hybrid mixture of the two? </p> <p>Edgar is not alone in using Speer as a means of exploring the nature of Nazism. Only last year at the Almeida we saw Esther Vilar's two-hander, Speer, in which Klaus Maria Brandauer appeared as Hitler's former architect and armaments minister. But Vilar's play was a rigged moral debate based on a totally artificial premise: that Speer would have accepted an invitation to lecture in East Berlin in 1980 and would have agreed to be subjected to forensic interrogation by his host. Vilar's purpose was quite plain: to put Speer in the dock and expose his supposed penitence as a survival tactic. </p> <p>Edgar's play strikes me as in every respect superior to Vilar's, in that it denies itself the soft option of posthumous arraignment to acknowledge Speer's masked complexity, hall-of-mirrors conscience and fatal erotic enthralment to Hitler. </p> <p>But two other works have also lately put Speer on stage: one factually, the other obliquely. The former was a version of the Nuremberg war crimes trial, edited by the Guardian's Richard Norton-Taylor and staged at the Tricycle in 1996. We were able to hear, in their own words, the testimonies of Speer, Goering, Field-Marshal Keitel and the pedantic philosopher Alfred Rosenberg. </p> <p>What struck me at the time was the variety of moral evasions they offered, from Goering's denial of all knowledge of liquidation policies to Rosenberg's semantic quibbles over the precise meaning of \"extermination\"; beside this, Speer's retrospective condemnation of Hitler and limited confession of guilt acquired a rambling sympathy. But the great virtue of the Tricycle's piece was that it presented the evidence and allowed us to form our own conclusions. </p> <p>The other, more oblique work is a play in which Speer's name is never mentioned at all: Harold Pinter's Ashes to Ashes. Pinter has freely admitted that the play was triggered by reading Sereny's book. In particular, Pinter was haunted by the horrific image of an underground labour camp in the Harz mountains where the workers were hurled by the guards into their own shit. But Pinter was also clearly intrigued by Speer's late-life love affair with a young German woman. His play becomes an extremely complex exploration not just of the magnetism of evil but of the spiritual duality that enables people to exist as both agents of tyranny and functioning human beings. </p> <p>What this suggests to me is that the documentary or the imaginative approach are the theatre's best weapons for addressing the subject of Nazism. If Edgar's play achieves only limited success, it is because it attempts to combine the two. On the documentary level, it is perfectly honourable. But it suffers from a structural flaw: the use of Speer in the first half as an unreliable narrator whose confessions to the Spandau pastor, Georges Casilis, have to wait until the second part for correction and re-evaluation. </p> <p>It is when Edgar allows himself dramatic licence that the play takes wing: there is one extremely powerful moment at the end when the furious ghost of Hitler returns to haunt Speer's imagination and to ask why, when he talked of elimination and extermination, he was never taken literally. Edgar, you feel, has at last liberated himself from his source and you begin to see the play he might have written. </p> <p>As it stands, Albert Speer is a perfectly valid examination of Speer's continued deception of himself and others.

Colours from one painting don't leak into its neighbours - not literally at least - but with sound you can barely stem the flow. In Mariko Mori's video installation, the artist oohs and aahs away in her guise as purple-hued space cadet, her ethereal vocals seeping quietly from a speaker. But she is constantly drowned out by Stephan von Huene's adjacent exhibit, a wooden robot emitting boisterous clicks and burps.

Paul Sch\u00fctze's elegant Site Three is its own microclimate, a glass-floored space with watery videos on three walls, and a very sculpted three-dimensional soundtrack: chill-out space as conceptual steam bath. In Brian Eno's Civic Recovery Centre (Quiet Club), a slide show mutates gently in the dark, to old-fashioned ambient rumblings; I was rather pleased to find its insular sobriety punctured by some low-level squeaking from outside. </p> <p>Another dark chamber contains Christian Marclay's film Guitar Drag, in which an electric guitar is dragged along a road on the end of a rope, making a godawful feedback death-rattle.

But there was also the pleasure of finding sheer brutalist noise in this rather studious environment. </p> <p>Outside on the sculpture court, Christina Kubitsch has draped a canopy of magnetic induction cables; put on headphones and you can wander around a virtual forest of birdsong and waterfalls. You still get occasional infiltration from the South Bank outside: clattering skateboards, burbles from Greyworld's walkway installation. But remove the phones and you're suddenly somewhere more interesting - outside the spectacle, watching 20 other people wandering around in silent reverie, listening to the oasis that is nowhere but in their own heads. </p> <p>Visual exhibitions, come to think of it, are not so different from Sonic Boom: some works will always be \"louder\" and drown out the opposition because they are brighter, or bigger, or more heavily publicised. But you also realise how some quiet works make their presence felt simply by asking you to sift them out from the hubbub. With Max Eastley's kinetic sculptures, you have to refocus your ears to a barely perceptible scrape or the tinkle of a few beads on a wire. One piece is a line of bobbing stick figures tracing invisible patterns on a white surface. The subliminal scratch is just sufficiently present to stand out from the overall wash of oo-ee-oo atmospherics and electronic haze. This is the natural sound of next to nothing, but it demonstrates with Zen discretion that near-silence can sometimes drown out the surrounding noise, just for a moment - the blink of an ear?</p> <p>Sonic Boom is at the Hayward Gallery, London SE1 (020-7928 3144), till June 18.</p>",

But all is not well in the Hamptons, a 30-mile long fork of land at the end of Long Island which is the favourite hideaway of the rich and famous.</p> <p>Money is not a problem in a place where it costs an average of $1m (\u00a3670,000) to buy a house on the 12-mile strip linking East Hampton, Southampton and Bridgehampton.</p> <p>\"Money has no meaning out here in the Hamptons,\" said Steven Gaines, the best-selling author of Philistines at the Hedgerow: Passion and Property in the Hamptons . \"Once you're insanely rich, this is the place to come. It's really summertime on laughing gas.\"</p> <p>But the part-time inhabitants of this ultra-rich enclave are still up in arms about a debate older than the United States itself - the issue of taxation without representation.</p> <p>Lowell Harwood, owner of a $6m beach house, with swimming pool, tennis court and putting green in Southampton, wants to know why should he pay local taxes when he does not have a vote.</p> <p>Mr Harwood, 70, who made millions through property development in Manhattan, and others like him are thought to pay about three-quarters of Southampton's property taxes but cannot take part in local elections because they are not permanent residents. He and about 100 others also pay water taxes for water they do not receive.</p> <p>\"Nobody is going to feel sorry for us,\" he said. \"That is not what we are looking for. We just want justice. If I can afford a house like mine these people feel that I can afford to pay their water bill. I don't mind giving money to charity but I don't like it taken away.\"</p> <p>No one in Southampton village has had water from the Hampton Bays district since a pipe was severed 62 years ago, yet Mr Harwood has to pay $1,800 a year for this, on top of the $700 for water he does receive from the Town of Southampton Water Authority.</p> <p>The monied migrants who help to swell the village's year-round 3,900 population by another 25,000 each summer would like a referendum on the water bills - except they would not be able to take part in it.</p> <p>Mr Harwood has said he may consider legal action to press his case if the tax situation does not change.</p> <p>His stand divides representatives in the area, which is just three hours away from Manhattan by road. \"It is a grave injustice to take the money of summer residents and not give them full mem bership in the club, said Bill Hattrick, a permanent resident who is president of the Southampton Association, most of whose 700 members are part-timers.</p> <p>But Joseph Romanosky, the village mayor, said: \"Permanent residents feel they can't drive around any more because of traffic and sometimes they can't even walk around because of the crowds of summer people. And now you are telling them that the summer people should have the right to vote?

      "bodyText": "The Memorial Day weekend, the first big bash of summer, is barely out of the way and there are weeks to go yet before the pinnacle of the season, the Fourth of July celebrations. But all is not well in the Hamptons, a 30-mile long fork of land at the end of Long Island which is the favourite hideaway of the rich and famous. Money is not a problem in a place where it costs an average of $1m (\u00a3670,000) to buy a house on the 12-mile strip linking East Hampton, Southampton and Bridgehampton. \"Money has no meaning out here in the Hamptons,\" said Steven Gaines, the best-selling author of Philistines at the Hedgerow: Passion and Property in the Hamptons . \"Once you're insanely rich, this is the place to come. It's really summertime on laughing gas.\" But the part-time inhabitants of this ultra-rich enclave are still up in arms about a debate older than the United States itself - the issue of taxation without representation. Lowell Harwood, owner of a $6m beach house, with swimming pool, tennis court and putting green in Southampton, wants to know why should he pay local taxes when he does not have a vote. Mr Harwood, 70, who made millions through property development in Manhattan, and others like him are thought to pay about three-quarters of Southampton's property taxes but cannot take part in local elections because they are not permanent residents. He and about 100 others also pay water taxes for water they do not receive. \"Nobody is going to feel sorry for us,\" he said. \"That is not what we are looking for. We just want justice. If I can afford a house like mine these people feel that I can afford to pay their water bill. I don't mind giving money to charity but I don't like it taken away.\" No one in Southampton village has had water from the Hampton Bays district since a pipe was severed 62 years ago, yet Mr Harwood has to pay $1,800 a year for this, on top of the $700 for water he does receive from the Town of Southampton Water Authority. The monied migrants who help to swell the village's year-round 3,900 population by another 25,000 each summer would like a referendum on the water bills - except they would not be able to take part in it. Mr Harwood has said he may consider legal action to press his case if the tax situation does not change. His stand divides representatives in the area, which is just three hours away from Manhattan by road. \"It is a grave injustice to take the money of summer residents and not give them full mem bership in the club, said Bill Hattrick, a permanent resident who is president of the Southampton Association, most of whose 700 members are part-timers. But Joseph Romanosky, the village mayor, said: \"Permanent residents feel they can't drive around any more because of traffic and sometimes they can't even walk around because of the crowds of summer people. And now you are telling them that the summer people should have the right to vote? They don't know these people and they don't trust them.\" But if the permanent residents don't know many of the summer visitors then they are they are among the few people in the US who do not. The comedian Jerry Seinfeld is one of the most famous arrivals, having paid about $40m for a house formerly owned by Billy Joel, but others include many of America's most famous figures, including Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, and, just to give it a bit of edge, the rap figures Jay-Z and Sean \"Puffy\" Combs, both of whom have faced criminal charges relating to, respectively, assault and possession of firearms. Each year the Hamptons becomes more popular, raising the volume of grumbles from lifers about over-crowding. But some outsiders are prepared to make adjustments, of a sort. Jonathan Iseson, 42, a hedge fund manager, has just taken delivery of a new 48ft cruiser, docked at Sag Harbour yacht club. The last one was 55ft. \"I got rid of the wife so I didn't need the space,\" he said. At home with Hollywood's big hitters Jerry Seinfeld Once the highest-paid man on television for his sitcom series, which finished two years ago. Since then he has devoted his time to getting married, buying Billy Joel's house for about $40m and hanging out, as they say Steven Spielberg The movie director is credited with starting the trend that gives the Hamptons its cache.

These hotels, the horrified narrator told us, were appalling.

Imagine the temerity! </p> <p>The only remotely interesting bit was when Kim found a couple of bits of crisps under her bed. \"I don't want to go any further,\" she snorted, but seeing as how she'd only just complained that all there was to eat in this hotel was biscuits, she might have sounded a bit more grateful. </p> <p>No Service Please, We're British was a pointless programme which could have lasted five minutes had they got rid of the Tina Turner impersonator who was disgusted by the room he'd paid \u00a330 for, and the unmarried couple who'd handed over some \u00a340 to stay in a shabby hotel in Rhyl.

The revelation that cheap hotels are scummy will have the nation in uproar, haranguing scheming hotel proprietors and encouraging a march on Downing Street to stop this evil trade. Or not.</p>",

These hotels, the horrified narrator told us, were appalling. And these fly-by-night rascals had the cheek to charge a whole \u00a325 a night for the displeasure of staying in one of their sweaty-walled rooms. Imagine the temerity! The only remotely interesting bit was when Kim found a couple of bits of crisps under her bed. \"I don't want to go any further,\" she snorted, but seeing as how she'd only just complained that all there was to eat in this hotel was biscuits, she might have sounded a bit more grateful. No Service Please, We're British was a pointless programme which could have lasted five minutes had they got rid of the Tina Turner impersonator who was disgusted by the room he'd paid \u00a330 for, and the unmarried couple who'd handed over some \u00a340 to stay in a shabby hotel in Rhyl. (If you make a living out of pretending to be Ms Turner or you go to Rhyl to live in sin, you get all you deserve.) While the programme-makers might think \u00a330 is a lot of money - which it probably is if you're used to making programmes to Channel 5 budgets - the outrage of the narrator was just tiresome. The revelation that cheap hotels are scummy will have the nation in uproar, haranguing scheming hotel proprietors and encouraging a march on Downing Street to stop this evil trade. Or not.",

Her head appears with its bright yellow V marking on the neck from the slow unraveling of her body at the entrance to the hole. <p>Following my slash-and-compost method of gardening, I'd hacked down a hedge bank last autumn and stacked the grass, nettles and twigs in a corner of the garden. Rediscovering this gem of a heap, which has been festering nicely all winter, I had wanted to incorporate it into the new compost heap. Although I've been looking out for grass snakes I haven't found one since moving here, until today. I love making rotting heaps but I'm always loathe to move them for fear of disturbing the creatures which make their homes there. Carefully dissecting this heap and discovering the grass snake is wonderful because it realises an ambition to provide a breeding place for snakes. It also tells me some thing about the ecological quality of the garden if it can support a population. </p> <p>Judging by its size, this particular snake is an adult female. In her confined tunnel in the heap she seems huge and is perhaps two feet long. The breeding season for grass snakes is late April early May, so I assume she is in here preparing to lay eggs. If she has already laid I don't want to disturb the eggs because the embryos can easily be killed by turning them. </p> <p>Grass snakes like our compost and muck heaps because they maintain a constant warm temperature for incubation and plenty of moisture to prevent desiccation. People and snakes, it would seem, were made for each other. What happened to our thinking about snakes that we changed from revering them as sacred to fearing them as evil? The ram-headed serpent was one of the most impressive and truly typical of the Celtic cult animals. A snake-handled vessel from Carlisle, and the statue of the river goddess from Ilkley holding them illustrate the reverence in which they were held in Celtic and proto-Celtic traditions.</p>",

Rediscovering this gem of a heap, which has been festering nicely all winter, I had wanted to incorporate it into the new compost heap. Although I've been looking out for grass snakes I haven't found one since moving here, until today. I love making rotting heaps but I'm always loathe to move them for fear of disturbing the creatures which make their homes there. Carefully dissecting this heap and discovering the grass snake is wonderful because it realises an ambition to provide a breeding place for snakes. It also tells me some thing about the ecological quality of the garden if it can support a population. Judging by its size, this particular snake is an adult female. In her confined tunnel in the heap she seems huge and is perhaps two feet long. The breeding season for grass snakes is late April early May, so I assume she is in here preparing to lay eggs. If she has already laid I don't want to disturb the eggs because the embryos can easily be killed by turning them. Grass snakes like our compost and muck heaps because they maintain a constant warm temperature for incubation and plenty of moisture to prevent desiccation. People and snakes, it would seem, were made for each other. What happened to our thinking about snakes that we changed from revering them as sacred to fearing them as evil? The ram-headed serpent was one of the most impressive and truly typical of the Celtic cult animals. A snake-handled vessel from Carlisle, and the statue of the river goddess from Ilkley holding them illustrate the reverence in which they were held in Celtic and proto-Celtic traditions.",

      "bodyText": "A signalman wept yesterday as he described the fatal seconds of delay in which the Paddington rail disaster might have been averted. David Allen admitted wait ing up to 25 seconds after the Thames train went through a red light because he expected the driver to realise his mistake and stop. Only when it became clear the train was not stopping did Mr Allen change the signal for the London-bound Great Western express, the official inquiry was told yesterday. The inquiry had previously heard that if the Thames train had begun emergency braking within 15 seconds of the alert reaching the signaller, the crash would not have happened. Thirty-one people died in the disaster last October, including both drivers. About 40 survivors and victims' families packed the public hearing yesterday as Mr Allen confessed: \"There was a short period of time when I was expecting the driver to come on the phone and say to me that he had passed a signal at danger. \"Then he progressed further and I saw that we not only had a Spad [signal passed at danger] but that we had a train running away.\" The only means to stop the Thames train then was to send the driver an emergency radio message \"because he's entered the junction, and I can't stop him, he's gone to the point of no return,\" Mr Allen said. His colleague James Hillman, who had hurried across the control room to help, sent the emergency stop alarm. Mr Allen tried to change the points on the line to divert the Thames train out of the path of the express, but could not because the points were locked. The signaller admitted his standing instructions were to stop a train's movements immediately once it had passed a signal at danger, but in his previous experience of \"two or three\" Spads, the trains had always stopped safely. An independent report presented to the inquiry said Mr Allen's reaction time was not unreasonable, while counsel for his employers, Railtrack, said the company believed he had done his \"best in difficult circumstances\".",

The would-be assassin was a member of the presidential bodyguard and of the elite Revolutionary Guard who tried to convince senior clerics to issue an edict allowing him to kill President Mohammad Khatami. The plot was foiled by the son of an ayatollah, who called the authorities. It was the latest instance of an attempt to lend religious authority to political violence. Hardliners are increasingly asking traditionalist clerics to endorse murder plots against those regarded as enemies of Islam. Eight men accused of the attempted assassination of a presidential aide, Saeed Hajjarian, on March 12 are believed to have received a fatwa from a hardline cleric in their religious centre in Shahr-e Rey, a town outside Tehran. Three were acquitted, and five were convicted and sentenced to between three and 15 years in prison. Residents of Shahr-e Rey say it is well known that murder plots are concocted in the town's main religious centre, where hundreds of members of the Islamic militia and Revolutionary Guard gather each week to hear hardline clerics preach. Rogue agents in the intelligence ministry who confessed to murdering secular intellectuals in the late 90s are also believed to have sought fatwas from hardline clerics. Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali, who became known as Iran's hanging judge after the Islamic revolution, said last year that plots to kill perceived enemies were hatched in the Shi'ite city of Qom at the Haqqani school, once the breeding ground of liberal-minded clerics, now a haven for hardliners studying to be theologians. The loose coalition of hardline clerics and their extremist followers striving for more political power has become more apparent in the last few years. \"An alliance has always existed between conservative clerics and traditionalists in society, but it is more pronounced now,\" a senior cleric in Qom said. Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi, the leading ideologue of the right, routinely says that violence to uphold religious principles is legitimate. According to sources close to the president and clerics in Qom, the would-be presidential assassin first contacted Ayatollah Hossein Nouri-Hamadani, who referred him to another cleric he said had higher standing. When he met the second cleric, Ayatollah Mohammad Fazel-Lankaani, the cleric's son called the authorities. \"This was a self-sacrifice by the son. Now, he will risk having to face the right wing's wrath,\" a cleric in Qom said.

French legislation requires that a corpse be either buried or cremated. \"We have lost a battle, but we have not lost the war,\" said Mr Leroy, a philosophy teacher. \"Until now, French justice has interpreted the law strictly. But with European integration, France will have to recognise that its attitude is exaggerated.\" In their 20-page statement to the court, Mr and Ms Leroy pointed out that the ancient Egyptians and the Inuits also preserved their dead, and that more than 100 Americans have had their bodies - or parts of them - frozen through the American Cryonics Society. \"Why them and not us?\" demanded Mr Leroy, whose mother died last July. He admitted, however, that his legal quest would have to be resolved rapidly. \"At the moment, mother's body is refrigerated in the local morgue and the R\u00e9union authorities claim she's a health risk,\" he said. \"We have no time to lose.\"",

Lieutenant Colonel Sukarwo, the commander of Indonesian troops in the northern Moluccas, said up to 1,000 people armed with guns, grenades and swords attacked the villages of Makete and Duma in the Galela district on Halmahera island just before dawn on Monday. \"They came down from the hills and by sea in a coordinated assault,\" he said. \"People were caught by surprise and many could do nothing.

The regional military commander, Brigadier General Max Tamaela, said last night that the Muslims attacked several more villages in Galela yesterday. In Dokulamo at least seven people were killed, more than a dozen injured and many houses torched. Local media quoted witnesses as saying that there appeared to be no concerted effort to hunt the attackers. Brigadier General Tamaela has deployed hundreds of reinforcements in the district, issued a shoot-on-sight order and asked the navy to tighten their blockade of the northern Moluccas. All the attacks are thought to have been coordinated by members of Laskar Jihad, a militant Islamic organisation based in Java that has infiltrated more than 2,000 fighters and arms into the Moluccas to intensify the holy war against the Christians. \"There are also reports that some army deserters might be involved,\" Col Sukarwo said.

Admittedly the own-brand wine was half price at \u00a35.99, but 48 bottles . . . it doesn't really fit the urchin boy in rags image, now does it?

With no apparent intention of repaying any of the \u00a32m he owes, Neil sustains the poverty-stricken image with verve and style . . . by going to Sainsbury's and buying not one, not two, not three but four cases of champagne! Admittedly the own-brand wine was half price at \u00a35.99, but 48 bottles . . . it doesn't really fit the urchin boy in rags image, now does it? A furious Laura Osborne of Mottram St Andrew, who found Sainsbury's almost out of stock after Neil's raid, writes to the Wilmslow Express newspaper to ask: \"Does the champagne lifestyle for the Hamilton's never stop?\" It is a theme taken up with relish by Neil's chief creditor. \"Up to his neck in debt, but still able to knock back the bubbly,\" says Mohamed Al Fayed. \"At least he's down to non-vintage now - that must hurt. Who says there's no justice?\" You do, actually, Mr Fayed. After all, you're the one whistling for \u00a32m while Neil and Christine clink flutes. \u0095Stupidest MP 2000 title favourite and defending champion David Winnick is in touch again, faxing extracts from Hansard recording his own priceless contributions to democracy concerning Sierra Leone (a country he sometimes mixes up with Sri Lanka).

      "bodyText": "The government is being taken to the European human rights court over allegations that the security and intelligence agencies have been engaged in the wholesale tapping of telephone conversations between Britain and Ireland. It has refused to deny claims, first made last year, that it tapped the phones from a tower at Capenhurst in Cheshire. The tower - described by the Ministry of Defence as an \"electronic test facility\" - intercepted phone calls carried by radio microwave between British Telecom relay stations at Gwaenysgor, Clywd, and Pale Heights, near Chester. The stations carried Ireland's telecommunications links through Britain. The government has never denied claims about the purpose of the Capenhurst tower which were first made by Channel 4 News in July last year. Lawyers representing the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, Liberty, its British counterpart, and British Irish Rights Watch, claim the interceptions breached article 8 of the European human rights convention guaranteeing the right to privacy. The Capenhurst tower, they said, had the capacity to intercept 10,000 simultaneous phone channels from Dublin to London and elsewhere. Tapped conversations included legally privileged material such as discussions between human rights groups and individuals who sought their assistance, they said. They pointed to a section of the 1985 Interception of Communications Act which allows the security and intelligence agencies to seek warrants enabling them to tap conversations without referring to a specific target or address. The act allows the home secretary to issue a warrant covering any information the agencies say they need to carry out their functions - so-called \"certified\" material - from \"external communications\". However, they can only gather this material by intercepting other conversations and information passing through the communications link. \"The procedure ... by its nature requires all material, regardless of whether it falls within the scope of the purposes defined in the warrants or not, to be intercepted,\" Richard Clayton, counsel for the human rights groups, said in their submission to the European court. He added: \"The material is then examined after the event in order to discover whether it falls within the scope of the warrant.\" He said the 1985 act effectively allows interception for \"any purpose\". The Capenhurst tower is redundant and up for sale and Ireland has a new fibre optic telecommunications system. Early this year, David Andrews, the former Irish foreign minister, said he accepted assurances from Robin Cook that Britain was not involved in indiscriminate or blanket tapping of Irish communications. Minutes of an Irish security committee, released under the country's freedom of information act, concluded there was \"no firm evidence available to the Irish authorities that commercial telecommunications traffic originating in or destined for this country has been intercepted in a systematic or extra-legal way\". However, members of the committee argued that interception technology in possession of many countries, including Britain, suggests that illegal bugging is going on. The human rights groupsbringing the test case argue that indiscriminate bugging is being allowed by existing English law in contravention of the human rights convention. John Wadham, director of Liberty, said yesterday that the loophole in the 1985 act will remain in the new regulation of investigatory powers bill which gives the security and intelligence agencies sweeping new bugging powers.",

These have now replaced Crosland's \"fucking grammar schools\" as the single main source of Oxbridge admissions. I do not advocate the return of selection in state schools; but simply point out the perverse consequences of retaining an unequal system that is segregated by wealth and income - that is, by class. According to Blair's adviser, \"Universities are fashioned by the schools that supply them... Far from bringing the classes together, England's schools - private and state - are now a force for rigorous segregation\".</p> <p>I think I am now beginning to understand the third way. Does it involve approaching problems from the wrong end? <br> <b>Dr Geoffrey Ingham</b><br> Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, Cambridge</p> <p>\u0095 An admissions tutor admitted to me how impossible it is not to judge applicants according to how well he thought they would \"fit in with the Cambridge scene\". Others delight in complaining that the problems are all external: if only there were no public schools; if only the government gave enough funding to the education sector; if only we could break down the preconceptions of all those students who don't apply.</p> <p>For all their goodwill, academics at my own institution seem unwilling to accept that they may have any degree of influence; or that they play any part whatsoever in perpetuating the social divisions that already exist within our education system. Perhaps this is the first preconception that should be broken down. <br> <b>Tristan Jones </b><br> President, Cambridge University Students' Union</p> <p>\u0095 A friend, from a private school, was rejected by Queens College, Cambridge in 1998. He is now at Yale. I am firmly egalitarian, but I do not believe that the government should be worrying about the privileged few, of whom Laura Spence is undoubtedly one. She, like my friend or I, is privileged by virtue of being intelligent. Whether she goes to Oxford or Harvard is irrelevant.</p> <p>Gordon Brown should be trying to provide money for the thousands of underprivileged children who live below the poverty line, and trying to raise standards in state education (by raising both spending and tax). He should help those who don't have a chance in life, not those who have a choice between top universities. The government should be more interested in the effects of their policies than in their popularity. <br><b> Philip Woolfe</b><br> Peterhouse, Cambridge</p>",

      "bodyText": "By far the most cogent explanation of how private schools have increased their grip on Oxbridge admissions (Letters, May 30) since their post-war low point of 38% in the late 1960s has been provided by the prime minister's education adviser, Andrew Adonis (A Class Act: The Myth of Britain's Classless Society, 1997). Since the mid 1970s, as Adonis shows, the consumer power unleashed by the middle class flight from Labour's comprehensives led to the revitalisation of the moribund mass of private schools. These have now replaced Crosland's \"fucking grammar schools\" as the single main source of Oxbridge admissions. I do not advocate the return of selection in state schools; but simply point out the perverse consequences of retaining an unequal system that is segregated by wealth and income - that is, by class. According to Blair's adviser, \"Universities are fashioned by the schools that supply them... Far from bringing the classes together, England's schools - private and state - are now a force for rigorous segregation\". I think I am now beginning to understand the third way. Does it involve approaching problems from the wrong end? Dr Geoffrey Ingham Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, Cambridge \u0095 An admissions tutor admitted to me how impossible it is not to judge applicants according to how well he thought they would \"fit in with the Cambridge scene\". Others delight in complaining that the problems are all external: if only there were no public schools; if only the government gave enough funding to the education sector; if only we could break down the preconceptions of all those students who don't apply. For all their goodwill, academics at my own institution seem unwilling to accept that they may have any degree of influence; or that they play any part whatsoever in perpetuating the social divisions that already exist within our education system. Perhaps this is the first preconception that should be broken down. Tristan Jones President, Cambridge University Students' Union \u0095 A friend, from a private school, was rejected by Queens College, Cambridge in 1998. He is now at Yale. I am firmly egalitarian, but I do not believe that the government should be worrying about the privileged few, of whom Laura Spence is undoubtedly one. She, like my friend or I, is privileged by virtue of being intelligent. Whether she goes to Oxford or Harvard is irrelevant. Gordon Brown should be trying to provide money for the thousands of underprivileged children who live below the poverty line, and trying to raise standards in state education (by raising both spending and tax). He should help those who don't have a chance in life, not those who have a choice between top universities. The government should be more interested in the effects of their policies than in their popularity. Philip Woolfe Peterhouse, Cambridge",

The measure of any democracy is to be found not only in the quality and efficacy of the government, but also in the quality and efficacy of the opposition.</p> <p>The Good Friday Agreement correctly establishes a system of government that may be characterised as institutionalised inclusion. This should certainly obtain in the transitional phase. It has costs, though, for the parties who take up office in the four party executive.</p> <p>It means they can never again go to their respective electorates and suggest that they will be able to fully implement their personal party manifestos. (Though this may be no bad thing.)</p> <p>Every party wish list will be tempered by at least two others, and the resultant programme of government will be at best a confluent compromise, at worst a confused collage.</p> <p>This system of including al most all the parties in government also has potential costs for democracy.</p> <p>We witnessed, in the pilot run of the executive, a congelation of power around the big two parties - the SDLP and the UUP - which saw, among other things, the abolition of a scrutiny committee on equality. Perhaps more worryingly, there were attempts to reduce the amount of Short money to be provided to parties in opposition.</p> <p>The Agreement is silent on the nature of opposition voices in the assembly. Our past experience, as one of those small voices, has proved that we are now, more than ever, vital - to provide a constructive critique and challenge our permanent coalition government.</p> <p>If Peter Preston's vision of \"normal\" politics is to have any chance of emerging, non-executive parties need to be able to function effectively. And that means they have to be properly resourced. There is nothing wrong with a coalition government, but when, as happened in January, the government cultivates clientalism without taking account of opposition voices, the quality of the democracy is diluted. We have come too far to accept second best now.</p> <p><b>Kate Fearon</b><br> Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, Stormont, Belfast <br><a href=\"mailto:kate.fearon@virgin.net\">kate.fearon@virgin.net</a></p> <p>\u0095 Ronan Bennett (Brute force, May 27) argues \"there is too much remembering and casting up of the past\", and then proceeds to tar the Royal Ulster Constabulary with the brush of John Nixon's sectarian killings of the 1920s.</p> <p>While the RUC have been guilty of corruption and human rights violations, officers have also shown immense bravery, particularly in protecting public security against terrorist attacks.

      "bodyText": "Peter Preston makes a prescient, and pressing, point about the role of the opposition in the Northern Ireland assembly (Peace first. Then normality, May 29) . The measure of any democracy is to be found not only in the quality and efficacy of the government, but also in the quality and efficacy of the opposition. The Good Friday Agreement correctly establishes a system of government that may be characterised as institutionalised inclusion. This should certainly obtain in the transitional phase. It has costs, though, for the parties who take up office in the four party executive. It means they can never again go to their respective electorates and suggest that they will be able to fully implement their personal party manifestos. (Though this may be no bad thing.) Every party wish list will be tempered by at least two others, and the resultant programme of government will be at best a confluent compromise, at worst a confused collage. This system of including al most all the parties in government also has potential costs for democracy. We witnessed, in the pilot run of the executive, a congelation of power around the big two parties - the SDLP and the UUP - which saw, among other things, the abolition of a scrutiny committee on equality. Perhaps more worryingly, there were attempts to reduce the amount of Short money to be provided to parties in opposition. The Agreement is silent on the nature of opposition voices in the assembly. Our past experience, as one of those small voices, has proved that we are now, more than ever, vital - to provide a constructive critique and challenge our permanent coalition government. If Peter Preston's vision of \"normal\" politics is to have any chance of emerging, non-executive parties need to be able to function effectively. And that means they have to be properly resourced. There is nothing wrong with a coalition government, but when, as happened in January, the government cultivates clientalism without taking account of opposition voices, the quality of the democracy is diluted. We have come too far to accept second best now. Kate Fearon Northern Ireland Women's Coalition, Stormont, Belfast kate.fearon@virgin.net \u0095 Ronan Bennett (Brute force, May 27) argues \"there is too much remembering and casting up of the past\", and then proceeds to tar the Royal Ulster Constabulary with the brush of John Nixon's sectarian killings of the 1920s. While the RUC have been guilty of corruption and human rights violations, officers have also shown immense bravery, particularly in protecting public security against terrorist attacks. Over 300 RUC officers have died in the \"Troubles\", many at the hands of Provisionals in attacks as bad as any perpetratd by Nixon. Jon Moran Bury, Lancs",

The contacts he built up gave him unrivalled access to regional sites, and the opportunity to pursue an interest in archaeology sparked at lectures by Wilfred Crosland and Philip Corder. A founding member of the Helmsley Archaeological Society, he taught evening classes around the north York moors, and received many honours, including an MBE. In 1995, a collection of papers on the archaeology of north-east York shire, Moorland Monuments, honoured Raymond and his friend and collaborator, the late Don Spratt. Raymond had a great generosity of spirit, freely assisting researchers and students. Innumerable publications have benefited from his photographs. His own published work comprises 90 monographs, articles and extended notes. His archaeological and photographic archive is now housed at the Ryedale Folk museum, of which he was a founder.

In March the owner of Harrods, Mohamed Al Fayed, won the rights to the website name dodialfayed.com after a United Nations trademark body ruled that Robert Boyd from Dayton, Ohio had no legitimate interest in owning his late son's name. The Geneva-based World Intellectual Property Organisation ruled against Mr Boyd after he offered the domain name for sale for $400,000 (\u00a3250,000).

In the course of this campaign - of which I was the only member for 17 years, being joined in the last few years by Robert Sheldon, Joel Barnett, Edward du Cann and, fatefully, Norman St John Stevas - I did some historical research.</p> <p> As part of Gladstone's reforms, the Public Accounts Committee was created in 1861 and the Exchequer and Audit Department, in 1866. The 1866 act said that every appropriation (that is, out-turn) account should be examined by the comptroller \"on behalf of the House of Commons\".</p> <p>This legislation was referred to the PAC for its committee stage. During it, the comptroller suggested that the act should state that the audit should be conducted according to rules laid down by the House of Commons. The treasury official giving evidence said that was the intent, but that there really was no need to say so in the act.</p> <p> In a debate on audit in 1903, the comptroller said his task was not only to certify the regularity of expenditure, but to comment on its merits (now forbidden by the legislation). \"I am a parliamentary officer,\" he said. In debates and committee reports on the subject in 1912, 1916, 1921, 1932 and 1946, the status of the CAG, as an officer of parliament, was confirmed.</p> <p> In 1976-77, I was a member of the expenditure committee and persuaded its general sub-committee to take up Normanton's strictures. In giving evidence to us, the comptroller of the day said: \"I am, of course, totally independent, even of parliament.\" The treasury's observations on the committee report said the CAG \"was not subject to directions from any quarter\".</p> <p>The expenditure committee recalled the comptroller for questioning; he now said that his status before the PAC \"was that of a witness\". Digging himself even deeper, he then wrote a memorandum to the committee saying that his department was \"an important instrument of the treasury\".</p> <p> Even a supine parliament had to take notice of the treasury's blatant encroachment on its rights, and audit reform moved up the political agenda, became Labour party policy and was (mostly) achieved by Norman St John Stevas (Lord Fawsley) in his private members' bill, which made it into law in 1983.</p> <p> I have written elsewhere (Whitehall: Does Parliament Work? Gollancz, 1992) of the establishment's skulduggery in trying to sink Stevas's bill. The chairmen of the nationalised industries, which were brought into the scope of audit, lobbied hard against it - and persuaded their trades unions to do the same.</p> <p>I was asked to tea by the chancellor and invited to drop the matter because the Queen, who nominally appointed the CAG, would be annoyed. (Some years later, I let it be known that I was considering applying to be comptroller - on the grounds that I knew a great deal about state audit in Britain - as the position was about to be vacated. I was told that the prime minister, as head of the treasury, would not allow my appointment).</p> <p> The act, however, was still not entirely what we reformers wanted: there were still significant areas of public spending not subject to its audit (for example, social housing, TECs). Its staff, though now mostly qualified or qualifying, do not have the higher degrees of the manager/engineers, accountant/social scientists of, for example, the US General Accounting Office.</p> <p> Now the government resources and accounts bill has been brought before parliament. Ostensibly designed to put government accounting on an accrual (that is, commercial) basis, this bill will govern much of what the PAC/NAO does and, more important, does not do.</p> <p> This bill does not allow the NAO statutory access to such new service providers as private contractors and voluntary bodies, which spend billions of public money - managing prisons, for example, and providing New Deal training. It does not allow the state audit of some 60 quangos (such as English Heritage) nor the 200 limited companies established by central government (for example, the student loans company) nor private/public partnerships.</p> <p>Oddly, while the government insists, under the \"best value\" proposals, that the local government Audit Commission is to police the performance indicators or output measures of local councils, the NAO is forbidden to do the same for central government departments.</p> <p> On January 20 this year, the PAC quizzed the chief secretary of the treasury, Andrew Smith, on these matters. \"We have to be satisfied... that there was no costly duplication of effort, of scrutiny and audit,\" he said, urging the committee \"not to accept that there was a conspiracy on the part of the people behind me somehow to deflect or obstruct the public interest in proper scrutiny\". He went down, babbling.</p> <p> All that MPs and the PAC need to remember is the great principle that parliament should have the right to audit the use made of every penny of public money voted by parliament. Simple, isn't it?</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nao.gov.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">National Audit Office</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">HM Treasury</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/commons/selcom/pachome.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Public Accounts Committee</a></p>",

Even a supine parliament had to take notice of the treasury's blatant encroachment on its rights, and audit reform moved up the political agenda, became Labour party policy and was (mostly) achieved by Norman St John Stevas (Lord Fawsley) in his private members' bill, which made it into law in 1983. I have written elsewhere (Whitehall: Does Parliament Work? Gollancz, 1992) of the establishment's skulduggery in trying to sink Stevas's bill. The chairmen of the nationalised industries, which were brought into the scope of audit, lobbied hard against it - and persuaded their trades unions to do the same. I was asked to tea by the chancellor and invited to drop the matter because the Queen, who nominally appointed the CAG, would be annoyed. (Some years later, I let it be known that I was considering applying to be comptroller - on the grounds that I knew a great deal about state audit in Britain - as the position was about to be vacated. I was told that the prime minister, as head of the treasury, would not allow my appointment). The act, however, was still not entirely what we reformers wanted: there were still significant areas of public spending not subject to its audit (for example, social housing, TECs). Its staff, though now mostly qualified or qualifying, do not have the higher degrees of the manager/engineers, accountant/social scientists of, for example, the US General Accounting Office. Now the government resources and accounts bill has been brought before parliament. Ostensibly designed to put government accounting on an accrual (that is, commercial) basis, this bill will govern much of what the PAC/NAO does and, more important, does not do. This bill does not allow the NAO statutory access to such new service providers as private contractors and voluntary bodies, which spend billions of public money - managing prisons, for example, and providing New Deal training. It does not allow the state audit of some 60 quangos (such as English Heritage) nor the 200 limited companies established by central government (for example, the student loans company) nor private/public partnerships. Oddly, while the government insists, under the \"best value\" proposals, that the local government Audit Commission is to police the performance indicators or output measures of local councils, the NAO is forbidden to do the same for central government departments. On January 20 this year, the PAC quizzed the chief secretary of the treasury, Andrew Smith, on these matters. \"We have to be satisfied... that there was no costly duplication of effort, of scrutiny and audit,\" he said, urging the committee \"not to accept that there was a conspiracy on the part of the people behind me somehow to deflect or obstruct the public interest in proper scrutiny\". He went down, babbling. All that MPs and the PAC need to remember is the great principle that parliament should have the right to audit the use made of every penny of public money voted by parliament. Simple, isn't it?

I think he has earned that chance.\" </p> <p>McManaman will not be given a specified role in tonight's line-up. According to Keegan it will be a case of \"go where you want, do what you want. I think it takes away something from anybody like him, a free spirit, to stick him out wide on the left, although he could still do it there.\" </p> <p>But what about the rest of the England team? Will they be sufficiently cute to bring out those qualities in McManaman so evident against Valencia at the Stade de France and, in the Champions League quarter-finals, Manchester United at Old Trafford?

It's just that I have been the one who has pushed forward trying to find the gaps. </p> <p>\"You still have a job to do, still have your opponents to pick up. You can't afford to run here, there and everywhere.\" </p> <p>Keegan, on reflection, concurred with this view. \"No-body really gets a free role,\" he said. \"It won't be a question of Steve going where he wants and the rest of the team getting the ball to him. But when he starts to run at people and use that tremendous energy he's got he frightens defenders. </p> <p>\"He can do it from wherever he wants against Ukraine. The team will not be built around Steve McManaman, but it will be built in a way where Steve McManaman can express himself.\" </p> <p>To give McManaman a free rein, Keegan is expected to play three at the back and four across the middle with McManaman operating behind the two strikers, who look like being Alan Shearer and Robbie Fowler. Michael Owen, like Dennis Wise, will be rested. </p> <p>Steven Gerrard will win his first full cap, playing alongside Paul Ince or Paul Scholes in central midfield, and Tony Adams will return to the defence unless Keegan feels he does not want to risk the Arsenal man suffering a recurrence of his back injury with the tournament so close. </p> <p>Gareth Southgate could also return and an appearance by Gareth Barry at some stage should not be ruled out. Nigel Martyn, the second-choice goalkeeper, looks set to be given a run-out. Richard Wright can expect to play against Malta on Saturday. </p> <p>Shortly after tonight's match Keegan will announce his squad of 22 for Euro 2000, having told the six players who will miss the cut the bad news after training today. </p> <p>Four are likely to be David James, Rio Ferdinand, Ray Parlour and Jamie Redknapp. The other two will come from Andy Cole, Kevin Phillips, Robbie Fowler, Nick Barmby and Kieron Dyer.</p>",
