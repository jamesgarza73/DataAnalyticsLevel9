It usually has an early clamminess to it that allows the batsmen their pound of flesh for a couple of days, and then the spinners come into play. Twirly men get their wickets in Lahore but so do the quickies. </p> <p>But this pitch is already biscuit-dry, grassless and with a mosaic of cracks. Push with a finger and they move. </p> <p>Javed Miandad, the Pakistan coach, had promised a turning pitch for England's batsmen in the same gleeful way that one might offer an agoraphobe a walk across the Gobi Desert. This looks like being no idle threat. The pitch will crumble and with it, many believe, England's chances of competing in this series, offered up on the altar to the mysteries, wiles and genius of Saqlain Mushtaq and Mushtaq Ahmed. </p> <p>For years, ever since uncovered pitches disappeared from the game, English batsmen have been laid waste by class spin bowling in helpful conditions. Abdul Qadir, Shane Warne, Anil Kumble, Stuart MacGill and Muttiah Muralitharan have all, at times, exposed poor techniques, leaden footwork and frail confidence. This winter, first in Pakistan and then Sri Lanka, offers as stern a test as any for England. </p> <p>Each on his own, Mushtaq or Saqlain would be a match winner. Together they represent the most formidable examination of batting skills that can be offered by spin today. </p> <p>At 30 Mushtaq is the elder by six years and more experienced by 20 Tests. England first encountered him in Saiwal on Mike Gatting's tour when, as a teenager, he employed the Qadir strut in to bowl. He took wickets even then and has since claimed 32 victims in eight Tests against them. </p> <p>Saqlain by contrast has never played a Test against England, although he is familiar with them from his exploits at Surrey which brought him 66 wickets at 15 runs apiece in 12 matches last season. Only Muralitharan challenges his spin supremacy today. </p> <p>Saqlain and Mushtaq pose different sets of problems. The former spins from the finger and is deadly accurate, and his arm-ball, unique as far as anyone can remember, spins away from the right-hander and appears to be undetectable. The theory is that this is spun over the top of the hand in the manner of a finger-spun top-spinner, but with unusual flexibility the rotation is angled not down the pitch but towards first slip. It is to his armoury what a completely disguised googly is to Mushtaq's. </p> <p>Indeed, Mushtaq employs all the tricks that a wrist spinner can muster: leg-break and googly, of course, but top-spinner, flipper and all the variations in between as well, all delivered from a high arm with enviable accuracy. </p> <p>If they operate in tandem England will have no respite. Mike Atherton, for one, appreciates the difficulties inherent in each, although he has played only once against Saqlain. \"The problem with him is the thing that turns, not just floats, away. You would be looking to play an orthodox off-spinner on a turning pitch to the leg-side with the spin and do the bulk of your scoring there. He is happy to see you do that because you would be hitting this mystery ball across the line. </p> <p>\"You simply have to learn to pick which way it is going either from the hand or in the air. Off the pitch is a last resort. The earlier the better and you need to be selective about the leg-side rather than hitting there willy-nilly.\" </p> <p>Mushtaq can spin his leg-spinner hard, but bowls with a high arm in contrast to Warne or, say, Ian Salisbury, and gets less sideways movement but more bounce as a result. Of him, Atherton says that the key has to be looking at the hand and trying to pick the variations early. </p> <p>\"He does give it some air,\" he said, \"so you might think about using your feet if you are comfortable with the prospect. In general, though, the key is to pick the length and use quick and precise footwork.\" </p> <p>One of the compelling prospects of the next few weeks will be to watch how the England batsmen develop individual counter-measures. Alec Stewart, for example, now more confident against spin first up, will use his feet and hit down the ground, whereas Graeme Hick hits over the top more readily than most and made a century against Muralitharan at the Oval a couple of years ago. Nasser Hussain, on the other hand, likes to sweep the ball. </p> <p>Perhaps the likeliest batsman to succeed will be the left-handed Graham Thorpe, a worker of the ball, who will more readily oppose Saqlain's variation and Mushtaq's more spun leg-break.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>One afternoon last month, barely a week before his sudden death at the age of 56, George Armstrong was leaning on a rail at Arsenal's training ground, watching the under-19s. On their way to a comfortable win over Watford, the junior Gunners were looking impressive. But Armstrong, the club's reserve team coach, was taking a longer view. </p> <p>\"If they get rid of the transfer system,\" he said, pausing to applaud a fine pass from Moritz Volz, the tall German boy in midfield, \"the wages will go mad. There'll be some 20-year-olds on 30 grand a week. And then how on earth are you going to persuade them to come back and train in the afternoons?\" </p> <p>As England prepare to launch a new generation of footballers on to the international scene in Turin tomorrow night, the future training and education of young players within the domestic game may be an even more important consideration than the identity of the next national coach. Arsenal are one of 38 English clubs participating in the FA Premier League academy system, now in its third year, and using it as a means of raising the level of locally produced players to match the standard of the young talent also being recruited from around the world. </p> <p>George Armstrong was part of that process. Thirty years ago, when Arsenal won their first league and cup double, the little Geordie winger missed not a single match all season. Raised in the deepest traditions of the English game, he nevertheless recognised the benefits that came with the arrival of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Running the reserves in the Wenger era meant not just grooming young players for the first team squad but helping them cope with the radical changes to the environment in which professional footballers grow up. If it all went according to plan, one or two of those boys on the training pitch would find themselves earning 30 grand a week before their 21st birthdays. </p> <p>\"Some of the clubs we play,\" Armstrong continued, \"fill their reserve sides with senior players who can't get a game in the first team. But the manager here likes me to play the kids.\" A couple of nights later his team travelled to Chelsea and, featuring barely a name familiar to the average Premier League fan, lost by the only goal to a team stuffed with internationally known figures. </p> <p>The players selected by Armstrong for what was to be his last side were almost all the products of Arsenal's youth scheme, which is run by another great figure from Highbury's recent past. From his office within the club's new training headquarters at London Colney, just inside the M25, Liam Brady supervises the progress of a group of around 130 boys aged between eight and 19, all of whom, under academy rules, live no further than 90 minutes' travel away. </p> <p>During their first five years with the club, Brady explained, the boys train for six to eight hours a week at evenings and weekends. From the age of 13, roughly 10 boys a year are sent to Higham Park School in Walthamstow where, in return for grants that have helped provide the school with a performing arts centre, the academic timetable is adjusted to allow the boys more time with club coaches at a special facility close to the school. \"It's been good for them, as far as we can tell,\" Steve Riches, the school's deputy head, said last week. \"We try to give them as normal a programme as possible, to help them keep their options open.\" </p> <p>This is the way things are being done at the de luxe end of the academy system, which was designed by Howard Wilkinson, the FA's technical director, to provide the same quality of coaching as France's centres de formation , the platform for success set up by G\u00e9rard Houllier, Aim\u00e9 Jacquet and their fellow visionaries. \"The idea is to give the clubs greater access to the boys,\" Wilkinson said. \"By starting at nine rather than 13, the clubs have more of an opportunity to influence their technical, social, intellectual and emotional development. Everything is intensified. You get not only a better footballer, but a person who can deal with the problems that come with being a top-class athlete.\" </p> <p>Another advantage of getting them four years earlier, Liam Brady pointed out, is a reduction of the influence of boys clubs and schools teams, those good-hearted incubators of the sort of crash-bang football that became the curse of the English game. Now all the early coaching is directed at developing skills, with the object of \"getting them to fall in love with the game\", in Brady's words. </p> <p>\"You wouldn't be getting a boy of that age to run half-laps in 28 seconds,\" he said. \"That comes later. And as they get older, you're also teaching them about their responsibilities to their team-mates. We're encouraging them to be confident in their own ability, and to try things, but we're also telling them that essentially teams are what win matches and trophies.\" </p> <p>Although academy status is given only to clubs capable of fulfilling a set of strict conditions concerning personnel, facilities and procedures, some critics of the scheme express doubts that, in all but a handful of clubs, the development of the coaching side is keeping pace. In France, for instance, where \"coaching the coaches\" is the keystone of the national football philosophy, the coaches are called together once a year for a week's compulsory intensive training at one of the regional centres. In England, by contrast, the annual requirement is 36 hours of in-service training. </p> <p>\"It's like producing school teachers,\" Wilkinson, himself a former teacher, said. \"You hope they'll feel they have a vocation, and that they'll want to enthuse the kids and get them to aspire to better things. So we have a continuous professional development programme, which people are not always enthusiastic about.\" </p> <p>But in purely footballing terms the FA's technical director has no intention of imposing any sort of national tactical formula. \"We want to educate the coaches better and then encourage them to add their own thoughts and imagination to the mix,\" he said. \"It would be totally wrong to turn out clones. It's not about giving them an A-to-Z of football practices.\" </p> <p>Instead the tactical philosophy must come from within each club. \"We play 4-4-2,\" Brady said, \"because that's the way Arsenal play, and I think it's important to have that kind of continuity. The manager has never insisted on it, but it's obvious that if we want to get our players into the first team, they've got to feel at home with the system when they make the step up.\" </p> <p>Although Brady's bunch includes boys from Germany, Brazil, France and Zaire, many of the brightest prospects are English, such as the Peterborough-born David Bentley, a 16-year-old whose uncommon vision and technique make him appear the natural heir to Dennis Bergkamp's No10 shirt. The benefits are reciprocal. The foreign players learn to cope with the pace of the English game while the English boys are exposed to ideas from other footballing cultures. Brady mentioned watching the 19-year-old left-back Ashley Cole, a member of England's Under-21 squad for tonight's match against Italy in Monza, making his Arsenal first-team debut. \"The first thing he's looking for is to get the ball to Bergkamp's feet or Henry's feet. Now that's a drastic change. Down the years, he'd have been told to belt it into the channels.\" </p> <p>At a club such as Arsenal, the quality of coaching is not in question. But for men like Brady, the frustration comes when their managers solve a short-term problem by picking up a foreign telephone directory and reaching for the chequebook. Wenger has used the less significant cup ties to blood some of his youngsters, but Brady, who established himself in the Arsenal first team at 18, knows that such a swift transition is much harder now that the stakes are so high. </p> <p>\"If even one or two from each year make it into the first team squad, we'll have done our job,\" he said over a bowl of soup in the training centre's restaurant, where the under-17s and under-19s were mingling between matches. \"The boys have to come to terms with that. Whoever you are, you're not going to have a smooth ride all the way through your career. If you can't handle disappointment, you're not going to make it.\" </p> <p>The young players receive a degree of pastoral care that would have been inconceivable a few years ago. \"You try to show a boy that he has to live a certain lifestyle if he's going to achieve his aims, and you show him that this lifestyle goes hand in hand with being a caring individual, with respecting authority, and with respecting team discipline. If he can learn all that, it's a lesson that will help him to succeed in his life beyond football.\" </p> <p>His eyes swivelled to the queue of boys waiting for their lunch. \"Michael! Take that off and put it in your pocket!\" A young man in a club tracksuit swiftly removed the large gold medallion from around his neck. \"John! What are you doing, eating that? You've got a match kicking off in an hour and a half!\" And another boy sheepishly replaced the lid of the soup tureen before putting his bread roll back into a basket. </p> <p>Small things. Small lessons. All part of a footballer's education, nowadays designed not merely to win matches and trophies and international caps but, as George Armstrong recognised, to confront perhaps the most testing opponent of all, the unimaginable impact on a young life of 30 grand a week.

      "bodyText": "One afternoon last month, barely a week before his sudden death at the age of 56, George Armstrong was leaning on a rail at Arsenal's training ground, watching the under-19s. On their way to a comfortable win over Watford, the junior Gunners were looking impressive. But Armstrong, the club's reserve team coach, was taking a longer view. \"If they get rid of the transfer system,\" he said, pausing to applaud a fine pass from Moritz Volz, the tall German boy in midfield, \"the wages will go mad. There'll be some 20-year-olds on 30 grand a week. And then how on earth are you going to persuade them to come back and train in the afternoons?\" As England prepare to launch a new generation of footballers on to the international scene in Turin tomorrow night, the future training and education of young players within the domestic game may be an even more important consideration than the identity of the next national coach. Arsenal are one of 38 English clubs participating in the FA Premier League academy system, now in its third year, and using it as a means of raising the level of locally produced players to match the standard of the young talent also being recruited from around the world. George Armstrong was part of that process. Thirty years ago, when Arsenal won their first league and cup double, the little Geordie winger missed not a single match all season. Raised in the deepest traditions of the English game, he nevertheless recognised the benefits that came with the arrival of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Running the reserves in the Wenger era meant not just grooming young players for the first team squad but helping them cope with the radical changes to the environment in which professional footballers grow up. If it all went according to plan, one or two of those boys on the training pitch would find themselves earning 30 grand a week before their 21st birthdays. \"Some of the clubs we play,\" Armstrong continued, \"fill their reserve sides with senior players who can't get a game in the first team. But the manager here likes me to play the kids.\" A couple of nights later his team travelled to Chelsea and, featuring barely a name familiar to the average Premier League fan, lost by the only goal to a team stuffed with internationally known figures. The players selected by Armstrong for what was to be his last side were almost all the products of Arsenal's youth scheme, which is run by another great figure from Highbury's recent past. From his office within the club's new training headquarters at London Colney, just inside the M25, Liam Brady supervises the progress of a group of around 130 boys aged between eight and 19, all of whom, under academy rules, live no further than 90 minutes' travel away. During their first five years with the club, Brady explained, the boys train for six to eight hours a week at evenings and weekends. From the age of 13, roughly 10 boys a year are sent to Higham Park School in Walthamstow where, in return for grants that have helped provide the school with a performing arts centre, the academic timetable is adjusted to allow the boys more time with club coaches at a special facility close to the school. \"It's been good for them, as far as we can tell,\" Steve Riches, the school's deputy head, said last week. \"We try to give them as normal a programme as possible, to help them keep their options open.\" This is the way things are being done at the de luxe end of the academy system, which was designed by Howard Wilkinson, the FA's technical director, to provide the same quality of coaching as France's centres de formation , the platform for success set up by G\u00e9rard Houllier, Aim\u00e9 Jacquet and their fellow visionaries. \"The idea is to give the clubs greater access to the boys,\" Wilkinson said. \"By starting at nine rather than 13, the clubs have more of an opportunity to influence their technical, social, intellectual and emotional development. Everything is intensified. You get not only a better footballer, but a person who can deal with the problems that come with being a top-class athlete.\" Another advantage of getting them four years earlier, Liam Brady pointed out, is a reduction of the influence of boys clubs and schools teams, those good-hearted incubators of the sort of crash-bang football that became the curse of the English game. Now all the early coaching is directed at developing skills, with the object of \"getting them to fall in love with the game\", in Brady's words. \"You wouldn't be getting a boy of that age to run half-laps in 28 seconds,\" he said. \"That comes later. And as they get older, you're also teaching them about their responsibilities to their team-mates. We're encouraging them to be confident in their own ability, and to try things, but we're also telling them that essentially teams are what win matches and trophies.\" Although academy status is given only to clubs capable of fulfilling a set of strict conditions concerning personnel, facilities and procedures, some critics of the scheme express doubts that, in all but a handful of clubs, the development of the coaching side is keeping pace. In France, for instance, where \"coaching the coaches\" is the keystone of the national football philosophy, the coaches are called together once a year for a week's compulsory intensive training at one of the regional centres. In England, by contrast, the annual requirement is 36 hours of in-service training. \"It's like producing school teachers,\" Wilkinson, himself a former teacher, said. \"You hope they'll feel they have a vocation, and that they'll want to enthuse the kids and get them to aspire to better things. So we have a continuous professional development programme, which people are not always enthusiastic about.\" But in purely footballing terms the FA's technical director has no intention of imposing any sort of national tactical formula. \"We want to educate the coaches better and then encourage them to add their own thoughts and imagination to the mix,\" he said. \"It would be totally wrong to turn out clones. It's not about giving them an A-to-Z of football practices.\" Instead the tactical philosophy must come from within each club. \"We play 4-4-2,\" Brady said, \"because that's the way Arsenal play, and I think it's important to have that kind of continuity. The manager has never insisted on it, but it's obvious that if we want to get our players into the first team, they've got to feel at home with the system when they make the step up.\" Although Brady's bunch includes boys from Germany, Brazil, France and Zaire, many of the brightest prospects are English, such as the Peterborough-born David Bentley, a 16-year-old whose uncommon vision and technique make him appear the natural heir to Dennis Bergkamp's No10 shirt. The benefits are reciprocal. The foreign players learn to cope with the pace of the English game while the English boys are exposed to ideas from other footballing cultures. Brady mentioned watching the 19-year-old left-back Ashley Cole, a member of England's Under-21 squad for tonight's match against Italy in Monza, making his Arsenal first-team debut. \"The first thing he's looking for is to get the ball to Bergkamp's feet or Henry's feet. Now that's a drastic change. Down the years, he'd have been told to belt it into the channels.\" At a club such as Arsenal, the quality of coaching is not in question. But for men like Brady, the frustration comes when their managers solve a short-term problem by picking up a foreign telephone directory and reaching for the chequebook. Wenger has used the less significant cup ties to blood some of his youngsters, but Brady, who established himself in the Arsenal first team at 18, knows that such a swift transition is much harder now that the stakes are so high. \"If even one or two from each year make it into the first team squad, we'll have done our job,\" he said over a bowl of soup in the training centre's restaurant, where the under-17s and under-19s were mingling between matches. \"The boys have to come to terms with that. Whoever you are, you're not going to have a smooth ride all the way through your career. If you can't handle disappointment, you're not going to make it.\" The young players receive a degree of pastoral care that would have been inconceivable a few years ago. \"You try to show a boy that he has to live a certain lifestyle if he's going to achieve his aims, and you show him that this lifestyle goes hand in hand with being a caring individual, with respecting authority, and with respecting team discipline. If he can learn all that, it's a lesson that will help him to succeed in his life beyond football.\" His eyes swivelled to the queue of boys waiting for their lunch. \"Michael! Take that off and put it in your pocket!\" A young man in a club tracksuit swiftly removed the large gold medallion from around his neck. \"John! What are you doing, eating that? You've got a match kicking off in an hour and a half!\" And another boy sheepishly replaced the lid of the soup tureen before putting his bread roll back into a basket. Small things. Small lessons. All part of a footballer's education, nowadays designed not merely to win matches and trophies and international caps but, as George Armstrong recognised, to confront perhaps the most testing opponent of all, the unimaginable impact on a young life of 30 grand a week. On its success, far more than on tomorrow night's result, England's footballing future rests. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Denise Platt Chief inspector, Social Services Inspectorate, Department of Health Social Services Inspectorate A figure held in high regard in local and central government, with access to political power, Platt \"operates effectively to promote not just social work but the whole of social care at the centre and to the public,\" said a panellist. \"She's dangerous - when she wants to be,\" said another. Platt has held many of the top posts in social services, after starting out as a hospital social worker. She was the first head of social services at the Local Government Association. She has been a president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, while social services director at Hammersmith and Fulham council in west London. When she became social services chief inspector in 1998, she was the first woman to hold the post for a generation. \"She's a well established figure in social care and she's now in a powerful role in the Department of Health, delivering government's social care agenda,\" said one panel expert. Spearheading an \"increasingly interventionist\" inspectorate, Platt might be expected to have a fascination for targets and indicators. But her main concern appears to be the qualitative experience of social care clients, rather than ticking check boxes. 2.

The building in Tokyo's Nagatacho district is usually the calm control centre of one of the world's most effective political machines, which has held power for all but one of the past 45 years. But it has plunged into a chaos of accusation and counter-accusation since Friday, when LDP heavyweight Koichi Kato made a blatant grab for power by calling for the resignation of his party boss, the prime minister Yoshiro Mori.

So did the entire left. The council is now run by a Labour rump in coalition with a Tory rump helped out by Liberal Democrats who are always eager to take part in anything PC.

The answer goes much deeper than incompetence. It goes back to Thatcher's assault on local democracy. Her government abolished the large councils which raised some of their rates from the rich to help the poor (GLC, Ilea and the metropolitan boroughs), and stifled the rest by capping their ability to raise rates. This put a stop to the process of municipal reform that sustained so many Labour councillors when they were elected (including rightwing Labour politicians like Herbert Morrison, the first Labour mayor of Hackney). </p> <p>In reply to Thatcher, there was none of the defiance shown by another Labour mayor, George Lansbury, at Poplar in 1921.

I cite a press release issued by Hackney Council on March 18 1998 entitled \"Top government official helps launch Hackney's anti-poverty strategy\". The \"top government official\" was Guy Gardiner from the cabinet office's social exclusion unit who visited Hackney the following day for the launch of the council's \"ground-breaking anti-poverty strategy\". The ground was broken with Hackney's two MPs over appropriately proletarian fish and chips in a local pensioners' club. The strategy, said the press release, \"is closely linked to Prime Minister Tony Blair's work on social exclusion\". A foreword to the strategy was written by Professor Peter Townsend, the veteran anti-poverty campaigner. The strategy, wrote Townsend, needed \"decently paid jobs and more of them in local public services\". </p> <p>What happened to that strategy? It vanished as fast as the fish and chips. A cabinet office spokeswoman told me nothing more was said on the matter. Guy Gardiner, who turns out to be an assistant chief constable in Kent, was an \"external adviser\" to the cabinet office. And now, as Hackney disappears under mountains of rubbish bags, the strategy of providing more jobs in the public services has been replaced by, well, you've guessed it, privatisation and cuts (and the sacking of hundreds of public service workers). Blair's great campaign against social exclusion turns out to be devoted in Hackney to social exclusion on an unimaginable scale. </p>",

And now, as Hackney disappears under mountains of rubbish bags, the strategy of providing more jobs in the public services has been replaced by, well, you've guessed it, privatisation and cuts (and the sacking of hundreds of public service workers). Blair's great campaign against social exclusion turns out to be devoted in Hackney to social exclusion on an unimaginable scale.",

Judge Terry Lewis ruled that counties may file supplemental or corrected totals after the deadline, and Florida's Republican secretary of state, Katherine Harris, may consider them if she employs \"the sound exercise of discretion\". It is a blow for Al Gore whose lawyers are expected to appeal against the decision in Tallahassee to Florida's supreme court.They have less than four hours to do so. Earlier, Mr Gore's campaign team swiftly rejected \"out of hand\" a suggestion by George W Bush's team of a way to resolve Florida's contested election. The Bush team had pledged to accept the results of manual recounts in scattered counties if Mr Gore would agree to a halt in the counting at the disputed 5pm (2200GMT) deadline set by state election officials. \"If the Gore campaign accepts this proposal and drops its litigation, we will dismiss our lawsuits,\" the Republican former secretary of state, James A Baker III, said at a news conference in Tallahassee. Otherwise, Mr Baker said, \"when is it going to end? I ask you, when is it going to end?\" William Daley, the Gore campaign manager, rejected the offer, saying Democrats would await the then impending court decision. But as important as the Lewis ruling is, it is only one of a mushrooming series of events popping up around the state that stands to pick the next president. Mr Bush held a 388-vote in an unofficial tally by the Associated Press, although the vote totals will change with the recounts as well as with the tally of overseas absentee ballots set for Friday night. Florida offers 25 electoral vote and the candidate who wins them stands to become the nation's 43rd president after one of the closest elections in history. Meanwhile, Mr Bush's lead in New Mexico disappeared when officials in Dona Ana County found 500 votes that had not been counted for Mr Gore. That gave Gore a 374-vote lead in the state, which has five electoral votes. A Gore victory in New Mexico would not affect the fact that Florida's equally close vote determines the outcome of the presidential election. But it would make any Gore victory more decisive and a Bush victory even narrower, with just two electoral votes to spare. Representatives for Mr Bush and Mr Gore have been clashing all day over the deadline aimed at shutting down all vote counting in Florida except for overseas ballots. Heavily Democratic Palm Beach county delayed its recount while the legal battle played out. Earlier today, representing Mr Gore, the former secretary of state, Warren Christopher, accused Ms Harris, the chief elections official in Florida and a Bush supporter, of taking a \"move in the direction of partisan politics\" by sticking with the 5pm deadline for certifying the county-by-county results. However, Karen Hughes, a spokeswoman for Mr Bush, responded: \"The vice president essentially said we should ignore the law so that he can overturn the results of this election.\" The Republicans are still considering whether to take their fight to block a manual count to an appeals court, and perhaps the supreme court. The Gore campaign won a federal court ruling yesterday that permitted hand recounts to continue in a few Democratic areas of the state. Officials in Palm Beach County, a Democratic bastion, said they cannot finish their hand count in time to meet the deadline, and they opted today to delay action until they see whether they have the authority to proceed. A hand count was proceeding in Volusia County while officials in Miami-Dade County were deciding today whether to take the same step. Even as Bush representatives intensified their efforts to get the counting wrapped up quickly, except for overseas ballots that must be received by midnight on Friday, Mr Christopher said he wouldn't rule out the idea of broadening the hand recount to cover the entire state if that suggestion were put in play. \"It's certainly something we'd want to look at,\" he said. \"Anything that would bring this to a fair result is one that I think we would have to look at very carefully.\" But both Mr Christopher and William Daley, Gore's campaign chief, said no such deal had been discussed with Mr Bush's officials. The Los Angeles Times reported today that some officials in both campaigns are intrigued by the idea of a state-wide recount to break the deadlock, but the two sides have not discussed it with each other yet. Meanwhile today, Mr Bush's lead in New Mexico disappeared today when officials in Dona Ana County found 500 votes that had not been counted for Gore. That gave Mr Gore a 374-vote lead in the state, which has five electoral votes. A Gore victory in New Mexico would not affect the fact that Florida's equally close vote determines the outcome of the presidential election. But it would make any Gore victory more decisive and a Bush victory even narrower, with just two electoral votes to spare. Mr Gore went before cameras outside the White House yesterday and said: \"I would not want to win the presidency by a few votes cast in error or misinterpreted or not counted, and I don't think Governor Bush wants that either.\" One week after the nation voted, neither contender has an electoral college majority, and both need the 25 electoral votes offered by Florida to fashion one. Mr Bush holds a 388-vote lead in an unofficial state wide recount tally maintained by the Associated Press, not including the unknown number of overseas absentee ballots. Mr Gore leads in the national vote by about 200,000. However, the US presidency is not decided on the popular vote but by the electoral college.

But Mr Gent said Vizzavi, a joint-venture with Vivendi, had not been affected by BT's renewed claims that the the venture was breaking an agreement with the French media giant. The Paris-based company is a partner of BT in French phone company Cegetel. This week, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) ruled against BT's claim that Vizzavi breaks a shareholder pact between the two companies. Mr Gent said he was confused by BT's behaviour, given that the company had made heavy hints about selling its 26% stake in Cegetel. \"I am not sure what BT's game is, but if they are potential sellers maybe this suing game is to get a better price. I sometimes think BT's legal department is out of control,\" he said. BT's dispute grows more complicated by the day - it is using a separate ruling made by the ICC to demand up to \u00a31bn in compensation. The ICC ruled that Vivendi had breached a different shareholder agreement by signing a deal between Cegetel's SFR mobile phone arm and Vizzavi. BT declined to comment on the situation, saying it is against the rules of the ICC tribunal. Mr Gent added that Vodafone might sell its 15% holding in Cegetel to Vivendi and will discuss the matter with Vivendi chairman Jean-Marie Messier. Vizzavi will operate on the combined companies' mobile, fixed and cable television networks in Europe and has been launched as a brand in the UK, the Netherlands and France. Plans are underway to make Vizzavi an international service available anywhere in the world, tailored to meet local needs and interests. Vivendi expects Vizzavi to break even within three years, following an initial investment of up to \u00a3950m.",

      "trailText": "In the second of a three-part series on next week's byelections we look at the former Speaker's West Bromwich West seat",
      "byline": "Kevin Maguire",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The racist shadow of the British National Party is hanging over the battle to succeed Betty Boothroyd in West Bromwich West. Nick Griffin, the 41-year-old leader of the far right group, is standing and intends to exploit whatever prejudices he can stir up on council estates and narrow streets in a constituency where one in five people are from ethnic minorities.</p> <p>\"Anti-white discrimination and resentment it causes is a major issue with people in the area and we will certainly address that,\" says Mr Griffin, betraying the fact the BNP has essentially not changed despite attempts to present it as a more moderate force.</p> <p>Next week's byelection, triggered by Ms Boothroyd's decision to hang up her wig and quit the Commons and Speaker's chair, will see the first real contest in the seat since 1992 when, after calculating for subsequent boundary changes, Labour enjoyed a 6,174 majority over the Tories. Barring a catastrophe for the people's party, Labour will hold the constituency on November 23 but on an expected low turnout the BNP could do uncomfortably well in an area where the far right has a long record.</p> <p>The National Front chairman, Martin Webster, polled 5,500 votes against Ms Boothroyd in the 1973 byelection that propelled her into parliament. At the last general election, as the Tories and Liberal Democrats respected tradition and declined to challenge the Speaker, NF candidate Steve Edwards - standing under that racist party's National Democrat colours - secured 4,181 or 11.4% of the votes.</p> <p>More recently at May's local elections the BNP secured 23.6% in Tipton Green, one of the constituency's seven wards, and the 230 complaints from racist graffiti and hate mail to disputes with neighbours, employers and police being handled by Sandwell racial harassment unit suggest the BNP has had some success in raising tensions. The unit covers four constituencies including West Bromwich West, and Maxie Hayles, its chair, says: \"The BNP are trying to make themselves look decent when in fact they are encouraging racial terrorism.\"</p> <p>Local police maintain race relations are improving. Sandwell council, covering West Bromwich West, is led by Tarsem King, the first Sikh to enter the House of Lords after being made a peer in June last year. Mahboob Hussaine, a Labour councillor with Pakistani roots, believes the tide is turning against the far right: \"The communities band together more strongly than before. People will vote for the best candidate and on their merits rather than the colour of their skin.\"</p> <p>The West Bromwich West constituency is one of those quirks of boundary commission changes, a seat that does not include the town it is named after. It is instead a collection of gritty metal bashing towns including Tipton, Wednesbury and Oldbury that merged into one sprawling conurbation during the industrial revolution. At the heart of the Black Country in the middle of England near the M5-M6 junction, it has no significant middle class or executive estates. Nearly half the workforce are employed in manufacturing (particularly car components with Longbridge 12 miles down the road) and construction, with almost half the electorate living in council houses.</p> <p>A quarter of voters are retired, few have post-16 qualifications, and very high levels of strokes, heart disease and osteoporosis have seen the government declare Sandwell a health action zone.</p> <p>Ms Boothroyd is remembered with affection but the lack of a proper election in 1997 has left the local machines of the main parties rusty and there are some complaints that, as Speaker, she grew remote.</p> <p>The Tories and Liberal Democrats accuse Labour of trying to hide the election, even claiming it wanted a truce on lamppost placards. Millbank resisted the temptation to parachute in a New Labour clone, leaving the local party to select bearded Adrian Bailey, Sandwell council's deputy leader, a former librarian and walking encyclopaedia of lower levels football after a lifetime supporting Cheltenham Town. Despite the Birmingham Post's description of Mr Bailey, 54, as about as inspiring as a vandalised bus shelter, he will be heading to Westminster on November 23.</p> <p>Canvassing with Urdu and Punjabi speakers, Mr Bailey enjoys a warm welcome on most doorsteps. The problem will be getting his vote out because most people appear to take it for granted Labour will win. Labour's own Mondeo man - he has had two car radios stolen in the past five years - is making fighting crime a big issue. \"I take nothing for granted but we are working hard for the constituency,\" says Mr Bailey. He is relieved no discontented Labour figure is standing to draw votes away from his campaign after a \"Labour Change\" candidate in 1997 gained more than 8,500 votes.</p> <p>Tory hopes are pinned on a recently elected councillor who her critics claim is a political novice. Karen Bissell, a 35-year-old legal executive, will be lent a hand by William Hague later this week and seems to make most headway in local markets when she campaigns on issues such as pressure from local trading standards officers to list weights in kilograms not pounds. She too is trying to make crime an issue, though claims that the local police station shuts at 6pm because of staff shortages have been contradicted by senior officers.</p> <p>Ms Bissell is also making much of the jailing of 75-year-old Mary Rooney for refusing to pay her council tax over a planning dispute. \"How on the one hand can Labour run Sandwell imprison a pensioner for a \u00a3360 debt and on the other propose to its members that we should write off \u00a3300,000 worth of upaid debt, which incidentally includes non-payment of council tax?\" she asks.</p> <p>If Sadie Smith fails to clean up at the polls for the Liberal Democrats, she will at least have left part of the constituency a little tidier after donning rubber gloves to collect litter. Refusing to divulge her age - though her more garrulous aides wagered she is about 60 - she proved her devotion to pavement politics to show that if Mr Bailey's council could not be trusted to keep the streets clean, she could.

      "bodyText": "The racist shadow of the British National Party is hanging over the battle to succeed Betty Boothroyd in West Bromwich West. Nick Griffin, the 41-year-old leader of the far right group, is standing and intends to exploit whatever prejudices he can stir up on council estates and narrow streets in a constituency where one in five people are from ethnic minorities. \"Anti-white discrimination and resentment it causes is a major issue with people in the area and we will certainly address that,\" says Mr Griffin, betraying the fact the BNP has essentially not changed despite attempts to present it as a more moderate force. Next week's byelection, triggered by Ms Boothroyd's decision to hang up her wig and quit the Commons and Speaker's chair, will see the first real contest in the seat since 1992 when, after calculating for subsequent boundary changes, Labour enjoyed a 6,174 majority over the Tories. Barring a catastrophe for the people's party, Labour will hold the constituency on November 23 but on an expected low turnout the BNP could do uncomfortably well in an area where the far right has a long record. The National Front chairman, Martin Webster, polled 5,500 votes against Ms Boothroyd in the 1973 byelection that propelled her into parliament. At the last general election, as the Tories and Liberal Democrats respected tradition and declined to challenge the Speaker, NF candidate Steve Edwards - standing under that racist party's National Democrat colours - secured 4,181 or 11.4% of the votes. More recently at May's local elections the BNP secured 23.6% in Tipton Green, one of the constituency's seven wards, and the 230 complaints from racist graffiti and hate mail to disputes with neighbours, employers and police being handled by Sandwell racial harassment unit suggest the BNP has had some success in raising tensions. The unit covers four constituencies including West Bromwich West, and Maxie Hayles, its chair, says: \"The BNP are trying to make themselves look decent when in fact they are encouraging racial terrorism.\" Local police maintain race relations are improving. Sandwell council, covering West Bromwich West, is led by Tarsem King, the first Sikh to enter the House of Lords after being made a peer in June last year. Mahboob Hussaine, a Labour councillor with Pakistani roots, believes the tide is turning against the far right: \"The communities band together more strongly than before. People will vote for the best candidate and on their merits rather than the colour of their skin.\" The West Bromwich West constituency is one of those quirks of boundary commission changes, a seat that does not include the town it is named after. It is instead a collection of gritty metal bashing towns including Tipton, Wednesbury and Oldbury that merged into one sprawling conurbation during the industrial revolution. At the heart of the Black Country in the middle of England near the M5-M6 junction, it has no significant middle class or executive estates. Nearly half the workforce are employed in manufacturing (particularly car components with Longbridge 12 miles down the road) and construction, with almost half the electorate living in council houses. A quarter of voters are retired, few have post-16 qualifications, and very high levels of strokes, heart disease and osteoporosis have seen the government declare Sandwell a health action zone. Ms Boothroyd is remembered with affection but the lack of a proper election in 1997 has left the local machines of the main parties rusty and there are some complaints that, as Speaker, she grew remote. The Tories and Liberal Democrats accuse Labour of trying to hide the election, even claiming it wanted a truce on lamppost placards. Millbank resisted the temptation to parachute in a New Labour clone, leaving the local party to select bearded Adrian Bailey, Sandwell council's deputy leader, a former librarian and walking encyclopaedia of lower levels football after a lifetime supporting Cheltenham Town. Despite the Birmingham Post's description of Mr Bailey, 54, as about as inspiring as a vandalised bus shelter, he will be heading to Westminster on November 23. Canvassing with Urdu and Punjabi speakers, Mr Bailey enjoys a warm welcome on most doorsteps. The problem will be getting his vote out because most people appear to take it for granted Labour will win. Labour's own Mondeo man - he has had two car radios stolen in the past five years - is making fighting crime a big issue. \"I take nothing for granted but we are working hard for the constituency,\" says Mr Bailey. He is relieved no discontented Labour figure is standing to draw votes away from his campaign after a \"Labour Change\" candidate in 1997 gained more than 8,500 votes. Tory hopes are pinned on a recently elected councillor who her critics claim is a political novice. Karen Bissell, a 35-year-old legal executive, will be lent a hand by William Hague later this week and seems to make most headway in local markets when she campaigns on issues such as pressure from local trading standards officers to list weights in kilograms not pounds. She too is trying to make crime an issue, though claims that the local police station shuts at 6pm because of staff shortages have been contradicted by senior officers. Ms Bissell is also making much of the jailing of 75-year-old Mary Rooney for refusing to pay her council tax over a planning dispute. \"How on the one hand can Labour run Sandwell imprison a pensioner for a \u00a3360 debt and on the other propose to its members that we should write off \u00a3300,000 worth of upaid debt, which incidentally includes non-payment of council tax?\" she asks. If Sadie Smith fails to clean up at the polls for the Liberal Democrats, she will at least have left part of the constituency a little tidier after donning rubber gloves to collect litter. Refusing to divulge her age - though her more garrulous aides wagered she is about 60 - she proved her devotion to pavement politics to show that if Mr Bailey's council could not be trusted to keep the streets clean, she could. Ms Smith is leader of Sandwell council's official opposition, a 10-strong Liberal Democrat group, though unfortunately for her poll prospects not one of the 10 are in West Bromwich West. \"All we hear are complaints about the council,\" she says. \"Adrian Bailey is deputy leader so he must take responsibility.\" The fifth candidate is the UK Independence Party's Jonathan Oakton, 52.

He will play alongside Arsenal's Butt-a-like Ray Parlour and Cap'n Dave Beckham in what is expected to be a three-man midfield.

The head Fox, currently keeping an eye on team England, shocked the world (or El Tel at least) by picking not one man over the age of 30 in his 26-man squad to face Italy. Today, he spooked them again by allowing Nicky Butt onto the pitch from the very start of the game. That Pete, he crazy like a Fox.

      "body": "<p>Three years ago, Christie Martin was 24 years old and weighed 35 and a half stone. She collected her groceries in the middle of the night from 24-hour stores; she never lingered at the school gates, in case it embarrassed her daughter: she was a complete outsider. </p> <p>Then she was warned that she could be dead within six months, and with a sense of resignation, she decided to undergo a stomach bypass operation, a procedure which could have been fatal for someone of her bulk. There were post-operative complications and a month of painful convalescence but the weight dropped off at the rate of more than a stone a month for the first year and today, Christie, from Arkansas, USA, is, at 12 stone, a third of her former size and is still, slowly, shedding the pounds. She has yet to relinquish the self-loathing of the seriously obese, but life is finally moving on and, on the surface at least, Christie's story is a personal triumph. </p> <p>So how did Christie get so fat in the first place? She says that she came from a destitute and broken family and was abused, mentally and physically. By the age of eight, she was nearly 12 stone. \"Every night, I prayed I wouldn't wake up in the morning, but I had to act like it didn't bother me. </p> <p>\"At 15, I went to live with my father and he didn't buy groceries but made us live on Slimfast. Then I'd go round to my mother's house and eat supper there and she'd say: 'Slow down.' Everyone made me feel uncomfortable about eating so I'd try to eat the way they wanted me to, but when they weren't looking I'd eat anything that was available. I did most of my eating secretly. When I was made to clear the table and put the leftovers away, I would take them into the kitchen and stand and eat it all real quick. I felt hungry and ashamed.\" </p> <p>As she grew up, Christie's relationships with men were often abusive: her weight made her feel she deserved nothing better. \"I think obese people settle for the leftovers.\" At 19, she gave birth to her daughter Olivia, by her first husband. They split up when Olivia was two. A year later she met Robert, who was to be her second husband. (She admits she stayed with him so that the \u00a316,000 cost of her surgery would be met under his medical insurance.) </p> <p>Christie's weight severely limited her life with her daughter. \"Other people had to take her out. I tried taking her places. I couldn't get into the car at the fairground but I could push her on the swing until I got out of breath and every part of my body started hurting.\" There was also the problem of shielding Olivia from other people. \"People would stare at me or chase me in their car and shout: 'Why don't you die, you big fat fuck?' As I took a step, teenagers would should: 'Ba-boom, ba-boom.' Olivia said once: 'Mummy, that's mean. Why are they doing that?' I began going out less and less.\" </p> <p>Finally Christie was referred to Professor George Khan at the Baptist Memorial Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, who believes that extreme obesity can be cured only by surgery. Christie was suffering from sleep apnoea, in which the tongue slips down the throat, threatening suffocation and causing the sleeper to wake continually, gasping for breath. To allow her to rest, she was sent home with her windpipe cut open for three weeks before the stomach bypass. </p> <p>Tonight an ITV documentary will chart her struggles during and after her operation. In the film, Christie is seen saying goodbye to her daughter before the operation. \"I'd have done anything for Olivia and without the operation our days together were definitely numbered. It was scary but I knew she would be taken care of if anything happened to me,\" she says. </p> <p>In surgery, Christie's stomach and intestine were divided so that all food must pass through a half inch pouch. After a minute portion of food she feels full. \"I still pile it all on my plate but have to throw it away.\" </p> <p>After she had lost 19 stone, she had 15lbs of loose skin cut away, giving her waist definition for the first time. \"I felt attractive to men but I had such low self esteem I had to get a buzz going first, by getting a few beers down me.\" She also turned to drugs, including marijuana and cocaine. \"I had a new body but I didn't know who I was anymore. The weight came off so quickly I couldn't deal with it. Losing weight made me feel better for a while. Wo! It was wonderful. But then I realised I was still sad and miserable and wanted to die. I had been hiding behind the fat. It had been an excuse for not going out and not dealing with my problems.\" </p> <p>Christie is currently living in a shelter for the homeless since leaving another abusive boyfriend. She has been offered a three-bed, two-bath flat on a government assistance plan and hopes to find work soon. Tragically, Christie's problems are being replicated in Olivia, now eight, who, in the Carlton film, is seen gaining weight. \"It's getting hard to buy clothes for her. I tell my family not to goad her. If they make an issue of it, it'll make her want to go and eat. I'm trying to keep her active. We go walking and play in the park. </p> <p>\"She was passed around my family so much and now I'm trying to rebuild our relationship. I was mentally abused and sometimes I say mean things to her. I get mad and say: 'God! You're so slow' or 'Go ahead, get fat. Be like I was', then I ask her to please forgive me. It is a long road for both of us.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Christie's Story is on ITV tonight at 10pm.</p>",

By the age of eight, she was nearly 12 stone. \"Every night, I prayed I wouldn't wake up in the morning, but I had to act like it didn't bother me. \"At 15, I went to live with my father and he didn't buy groceries but made us live on Slimfast. Then I'd go round to my mother's house and eat supper there and she'd say: 'Slow down.' Everyone made me feel uncomfortable about eating so I'd try to eat the way they wanted me to, but when they weren't looking I'd eat anything that was available. I did most of my eating secretly. When I was made to clear the table and put the leftovers away, I would take them into the kitchen and stand and eat it all real quick. I felt hungry and ashamed.\" As she grew up, Christie's relationships with men were often abusive: her weight made her feel she deserved nothing better. \"I think obese people settle for the leftovers.\" At 19, she gave birth to her daughter Olivia, by her first husband. They split up when Olivia was two. A year later she met Robert, who was to be her second husband. (She admits she stayed with him so that the \u00a316,000 cost of her surgery would be met under his medical insurance.) Christie's weight severely limited her life with her daughter. \"Other people had to take her out. I tried taking her places. I couldn't get into the car at the fairground but I could push her on the swing until I got out of breath and every part of my body started hurting.\" There was also the problem of shielding Olivia from other people. \"People would stare at me or chase me in their car and shout: 'Why don't you die, you big fat fuck?' As I took a step, teenagers would should: 'Ba-boom, ba-boom.' Olivia said once: 'Mummy, that's mean. Why are they doing that?' I began going out less and less.\" Finally Christie was referred to Professor George Khan at the Baptist Memorial Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, who believes that extreme obesity can be cured only by surgery. Christie was suffering from sleep apnoea, in which the tongue slips down the throat, threatening suffocation and causing the sleeper to wake continually, gasping for breath. To allow her to rest, she was sent home with her windpipe cut open for three weeks before the stomach bypass. Tonight an ITV documentary will chart her struggles during and after her operation. In the film, Christie is seen saying goodbye to her daughter before the operation. \"I'd have done anything for Olivia and without the operation our days together were definitely numbered. It was scary but I knew she would be taken care of if anything happened to me,\" she says. In surgery, Christie's stomach and intestine were divided so that all food must pass through a half inch pouch. After a minute portion of food she feels full. \"I still pile it all on my plate but have to throw it away.\" After she had lost 19 stone, she had 15lbs of loose skin cut away, giving her waist definition for the first time. \"I felt attractive to men but I had such low self esteem I had to get a buzz going first, by getting a few beers down me.\" She also turned to drugs, including marijuana and cocaine. \"I had a new body but I didn't know who I was anymore. The weight came off so quickly I couldn't deal with it. Losing weight made me feel better for a while. Wo! It was wonderful. But then I realised I was still sad and miserable and wanted to die. I had been hiding behind the fat. It had been an excuse for not going out and not dealing with my problems.\" Christie is currently living in a shelter for the homeless since leaving another abusive boyfriend. She has been offered a three-bed, two-bath flat on a government assistance plan and hopes to find work soon. Tragically, Christie's problems are being replicated in Olivia, now eight, who, in the Carlton film, is seen gaining weight. \"It's getting hard to buy clothes for her. I tell my family not to goad her. If they make an issue of it, it'll make her want to go and eat. I'm trying to keep her active. We go walking and play in the park. \"She was passed around my family so much and now I'm trying to rebuild our relationship. I was mentally abused and sometimes I say mean things to her. I get mad and say: 'God! You're so slow' or 'Go ahead, get fat. Be like I was', then I ask her to please forgive me. It is a long road for both of us.\" \u0095 Christie's Story is on ITV tonight at 10pm.",

Where previously they would have had to resort to dark mutterings about the perils of dental neglect - scare tactics along the lines of \"all your teeth will fall out\" - Deliargyris, a cardiologist at the University of North Carolina, has come up with a rather more convincing threat. According to a study he presented to the American Heart Association's annual meeting at the weekend, gum disease could be a significant contributory factor in a large proportion of heart attacks. </p> <p>The most common afflictions always seem the most baffling to medical researchers: just look at the common cold. In the case of heart attacks, one third of all instances of the country's biggest killer remain unexplained by the conventional risk factors of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and smoking. </p> <p>Deliargyris may be edging towards a solution to the mystery. In his study, periodontal disease - the official term for advanced gum disease, as opposed to the less serious gingivitis - was found in 85% of subjects who had suffered heart attacks, compared with 29% of those who had not. The 85% in question also displayed abnormally high levels in their bloodstream of a protein, CRP, which is associated with both conditions. </p> <p>Alarming stuff. And yet the finding is only a small part of a growing body of evidence suggesting that this most common of ailments - gum disease affects around 10% of the population to a serious degree, and many others less acutely - could be implicated in a wide range of conditions, from pneumonia to premature birth. </p> <p>The mouth is awash with bacteria at the best of times, but most of them are beneficial. Problems only arise when destructive bacteria - plaque - are allowed to build up, leading to sore and bleeding gums, bad breath and loose teeth. Swollen and torn gums provide the bacteria with an easy entry point into the bloodstream, where they can trigger an inflammatory response in the arteries associated with heart attacks. </p> <p>\"The one thing we know about [gum disease and heart attacks] is that they tend to initiate an immune response, also called an inflammatory response, in the body. We believe that patients with a heart attack and periodontal disease have an exaggerated inflammatory response . . . that might put them at risk of future heart attacks,\" says Deliargyris, whose findings have particular significance for those who have already suffered a heart attack and want to reduce the risk of a repeat occurrence. \"This work also raises the possibility that by treating severe gum disease in people with heart attacks, we might be able to reduce their CRP levels and their risk of another heart attack.\" </p> <p>To probe the links between the mouth and the heart is to enter the murky world of epidemiological correlation - where the prevalence of one condition in a population suffering from another cannot be taken as proof of causation, and few experts are willing to say for certain what they think is going on. But the evidence, in study after study, is growing more convincing. One such investigation found that gum disease was a stronger predictor of heart disease in the American subject group than any of the conventional risk factors. </p> <p>\"We know that bacteria get from the mouth to the bloodstream very regularly - if you have a tooth extracted, for example, it will happen to a minor degree,\" says Newell Johnson, professor of oral medicine and pathology at King's College, London. \"Most people clear it from their bloodstream quickly, but if you have advanced periodontal disease, you already have a deep-seated infection in pockets around the teeth.\" </p> <p>Once the plaque bacteria have entered the bloodstream, it may not just be coronary problems that ensue. A study published in September found that women with severe gum disease were more than seven times more likely to give birth to a premature, low-weight baby than those with healthy gums, possibly because the bacteria in plaque can have an inflammatory effect on the placenta. \"The results of the trial indicate that the effect of gum disease in pregnancy seems to be as harmful as other well-established risk factors such as smoking,\" the report's author, Professor Steven Offenbacher, said at the time. </p> <p>Dental professionals are understandably unwilling to say so, but overvigorous flossing or brushing can also contribute to the problem once gum disease has taken hold, further damaging tissue in the mouth and sending more bacteria into the bloodstream. But it's not that simple, of course: underzealous brushing is one of the surest ways to contract the disease in the first place. Another is a deficiency in levels of saliva, which contains antibodies that fight infection: a dry mouth - brought on, for example, by many prescription drugs - can increase the risk of gum disease considerably. </p> <p>There are those who dispute the link entirely. Two months ago, the world's medical media fixated briefly on a study from the University of Washington suggesting that there was no clear connection between gum disease and heart attacks - or if there was, it was \"very small or very hard to reliably detect\", according to Philippe Hujoel, the lead researcher.

Nevertheless, he adds, \"With heart disease the evidence shows a strong association. And it appears to be like a dose response: the worse the gum disease, the greater the risk of coronary heart disease. </p> <p>\"What we still haven't established, though, is the impact of intervention: whether, if you treat gum disease successfully, you actually reduce the risk of coronary events.\" While the jury is out, the British Heart Foundation recommends that anybody with a heart condition should take particularly good care of their mouth and teeth: the same advice, of course, that we have all been receiving since we were toddlers - only this time with an even better incentive for compliance.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Every country in Europe has been affected by the dramatic increase in refugees and asylum seekers. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent economic turmoil, together with the hundreds of thousands of households displaced by the Balkan conflicts has placed unprecedented pressure on receiving countries.</p> <p>Social workers help asylum seekers rebuild their lives after trauma. They work against a rising tide of xenophobia affecting many European countries.</p> <p>Belatedly, the UK government has made positive noises about the contribution some refugees can make to British society and has strengthened resettlement support services. However, some of the restrictions already introduced by home secretary Jack Straw, under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, leave a new group of asylum seekers out of any entitlement to help with accommodation costs. This may prompt a challenge under the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>Conservative home secretary Michael Howard had previously introduced legislation drawing a distinction between asylum seekers who make their application in the country, usually after locating friends or family members, and those who make their application at the port of entry. The second group retained their entitlement to social security benefits and housing costs.</p> <p>Many of the latter were placed in social housing by local authorities, pending a decision on their asylum application. Their rent was covered through their benefit entitlement. The huge backlog of applicants awaiting a decision (over 75,000) means that there is a long wait, during which families put down roots, place children in school and begin the process of settling in to a new life and new community.</p> <p>Since September 25, if an application for asylum is rejected, this group of asylum seekers lose their social security benefits and have to apply to the national asylum support service (NASS). Under the scheme, asylum seekers receive vouchers and may be dispersed to any part of the country.

      "bodyText": "Every country in Europe has been affected by the dramatic increase in refugees and asylum seekers. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent economic turmoil, together with the hundreds of thousands of households displaced by the Balkan conflicts has placed unprecedented pressure on receiving countries. Social workers help asylum seekers rebuild their lives after trauma. They work against a rising tide of xenophobia affecting many European countries. Belatedly, the UK government has made positive noises about the contribution some refugees can make to British society and has strengthened resettlement support services. However, some of the restrictions already introduced by home secretary Jack Straw, under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, leave a new group of asylum seekers out of any entitlement to help with accommodation costs. This may prompt a challenge under the Human Rights Act. Conservative home secretary Michael Howard had previously introduced legislation drawing a distinction between asylum seekers who make their application in the country, usually after locating friends or family members, and those who make their application at the port of entry. The second group retained their entitlement to social security benefits and housing costs. Many of the latter were placed in social housing by local authorities, pending a decision on their asylum application. Their rent was covered through their benefit entitlement. The huge backlog of applicants awaiting a decision (over 75,000) means that there is a long wait, during which families put down roots, place children in school and begin the process of settling in to a new life and new community. Since September 25, if an application for asylum is rejected, this group of asylum seekers lose their social security benefits and have to apply to the national asylum support service (NASS). Under the scheme, asylum seekers receive vouchers and may be dispersed to any part of the country. Over 85% of applications for asylum are turned down at first (although roughly a fifth of all appeals are successful). The consequences are severe. Although households with school age children are excluded from the scheme so that their education will not be disrupted, the impact on childless households and those with children under school age is immediate. They are unable to pay rent and face eviction. To receive any help, they have to move to an area where they know nobody. They have no income other than vouchers. The backlog of in-country applicants is such that as many as 15,000 people may be in this position - although the slow pace of decisions means that few cases have yet come through to housing departments. The majority of asylum-seeking households are still in London. The Association of London Government has negotiated with NASS to ensure that councils in the capital do not lose out in rental income from asylum seekers whose application fail. Mark Brangwyn, the association's policy adviser, says: \"We are working with the national asylum support scheme to find a solution which is fair to local authorities and minimises the disruption.\" One possibility is that NASS meets the rental costs of families and that only single or childless couples will be dispersed. However that could militate against the government's dispersal policy. And some authorities will be keen to see asylum seekers dispersed because of pressure to rehouse the indigenous homeless.

      "body": "<p> American film-maker Craig Baldwin is the Ancient Mariner of American underground cinema, button-holing the unwary with rambling, hair-raising narratives of doom and perdition. His stories, in which no less than the entire history of Western culture is at stake, are paranoid epics of warfare and psychological combat. Baldwin's speciality is sampled cinema - he slowly, painstakingly builds mosaics of TV and film footage, sometimes only a couple of seconds long, and transforms them, with the addition of breathless voice-overs, into paranoid narratives of conspiracy and mind control. </p> <p>Spectres of the Spectrum is only marginally less delirious than Baldwin's Tribulation 99: Alien Anomalies Under America, a mock-reactionary sci-fi story that satirically presented Kissinger, Pinochet and the Contras as intrepid hunters of extra-terrestrial vampires. </p> <p>Where Tribulation 99 laid itself open to incomprehension by masquerading as a crypto-fascist rant, Spectres positions itself on the revolutionary margins of the near future. Its heroes, seen in live-action footage, are a young telepathic woman, Boo Boo, and her father Yogi, agit-prop broadcasters in the people's Resistance to the New Electromagnetic Order. </p> <p>The narrative key to all this is a 1950s popular science TV show, in which Boo Boo's grandmother has concealed a message which will aid the future revolutionaries. As Boo Boo travels back in time to unlock granny's secret, Yogi scans the history of the electro-magnetic power struggle, from Benjamin Franklin's kite, through electrical pioneer Nikola Tesla, to the age of the internet and its \"corporate colonisation of the imagination\". </p> <p>Disorienting as the film is, you can always trace a passionate conviction - the opposition to the ownership of images. Baldwin's sampling style wrests found images away from copyright and any official meanings they may once have had. Innocuous moments of family entertainment yield worrying new meanings, dark warnings of a future world under the surveillance of \"Disney spy satellites\". </p> <p>Baldwin's work draws on a history of underground film-making from Joseph Cornell to 1980s scratch video as well as today's climate of anti-corporate culture-jamming. Spectres of the Spectrum (SOS for short) is radical pop art, and head-spinningly entertaining storytelling, if you manage to keep up with it. </p> <p> At the National Film Theatre, London SE1 (020-7928 3232), tonight.</p>",

      "bodyText": "American film-maker Craig Baldwin is the Ancient Mariner of American underground cinema, button-holing the unwary with rambling, hair-raising narratives of doom and perdition. His stories, in which no less than the entire history of Western culture is at stake, are paranoid epics of warfare and psychological combat. Baldwin's speciality is sampled cinema - he slowly, painstakingly builds mosaics of TV and film footage, sometimes only a couple of seconds long, and transforms them, with the addition of breathless voice-overs, into paranoid narratives of conspiracy and mind control. Spectres of the Spectrum is only marginally less delirious than Baldwin's Tribulation 99: Alien Anomalies Under America, a mock-reactionary sci-fi story that satirically presented Kissinger, Pinochet and the Contras as intrepid hunters of extra-terrestrial vampires. Where Tribulation 99 laid itself open to incomprehension by masquerading as a crypto-fascist rant, Spectres positions itself on the revolutionary margins of the near future. Its heroes, seen in live-action footage, are a young telepathic woman, Boo Boo, and her father Yogi, agit-prop broadcasters in the people's Resistance to the New Electromagnetic Order. The narrative key to all this is a 1950s popular science TV show, in which Boo Boo's grandmother has concealed a message which will aid the future revolutionaries. As Boo Boo travels back in time to unlock granny's secret, Yogi scans the history of the electro-magnetic power struggle, from Benjamin Franklin's kite, through electrical pioneer Nikola Tesla, to the age of the internet and its \"corporate colonisation of the imagination\". Disorienting as the film is, you can always trace a passionate conviction - the opposition to the ownership of images. Baldwin's sampling style wrests found images away from copyright and any official meanings they may once have had. Innocuous moments of family entertainment yield worrying new meanings, dark warnings of a future world under the surveillance of \"Disney spy satellites\". Baldwin's work draws on a history of underground film-making from Joseph Cornell to 1980s scratch video as well as today's climate of anti-corporate culture-jamming. Spectres of the Spectrum (SOS for short) is radical pop art, and head-spinningly entertaining storytelling, if you manage to keep up with it. At the National Film Theatre, London SE1 (020-7928 3232), tonight.",

      "trailText": "<p>As small publishers fight back against Waterstone's, John Smith &amp; Son celebrates 249 years of independence, Bertelsmann looks to a filesharing future, and the Booker fails to inspire readers</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> The spirit of popular revolt, perhaps inspired by the fuel protesters, has hit the book business. Small publishers across the country are starting to fight back against what they see as a threat to their livelihoods from Waterstone's, the nation's largest dedicated bookseller. The latest spat between the big W and its suppliers came in response to a letter sent out by Waterstone's to smaller publishers stating that, from this week, it would be buying in their titles at a new standard discount of 50% - an increase in some cases from 35%. Waterstone's said the new terms would be used regardless of whether publishers replied to its letter or not. </p> <p>Smaller publishers, many of whom already feel ill-disposed to the ailing retail chain, reacted as small publishers are wont to do when such demands are issued in this way: they threatened to withhold their books. Tiverton-based local publisher Halsgrove went a step further and issued a press release stating its reasons for suspending dealings with the bookseller and calling on its customers to support its stance. Accusing Waterstone's of the \"worst case of commercial arrogance\" it had come across, the publisher argued that the bookseller was \"attempting to dig themselves out of trouble\" by imposing the new terms and thereby making \"regional publishing unviable\". It is not the first time that Waterstone's has raised the ire of publishers and risked the loss of their titles and no doubt it will not be the last. </p> <p>Waterstone's defended itself in the trade press by arguing that it was losing money on these books and needed to \"professionalise\" its relationships with smaller publishers. Quite how Waterstone's interprets the word \"professionalise\" is anyone's guess but more puzzling still, given the level of accounting sophistication it would take to calculate the real cost of selling individual books, was the assertion that the bookseller was actually losing money on these titles. Still, if Waterstone's believes it can arrest the decline in the performance of its business by offering fewer books to its customers and going to war with its suppliers, who in the trade can argue?</p> <p><strong>Birthday buy-out for John Smith</strong></p> <p>Better news from across the border where bookseller John Smith &amp; Son celebrated its 249th year of independence by announcing that its present managing director, Willie Anderson, was to buy the business from its current chairman, Robert Clow and his family. </p> <p>The deal is something of a personal triumph for Anderson, one-time president of the Booksellers Association and a vociferous supporter of all things independent. Mr Anderson, who has been managing director of the chain since 1994, has overseen the business during a period of much needed retrenchment thanks to the expansion of the US chain Borders and Waterstone's into its territories. </p> <p>The fact that John Smith has survived in what Mr Anderson calls a \"volatile and uncertain\" market speaks volumes about the loyalty of its customers and the flexibility of its staff. The management buy-out will also be welcomed by those publishers who fear more power being placed in the hands of the large bookselling chains.</p> <p><strong>Bertelsmann's not caught napping</strong></p> <p>Meanwhile, in a galaxy far away, Bertelsmann has struck up a deal with Napster, the online peer-to-peer music-sharing renegade. Under the terms of the deal Bertelsmann will fund Napster's development into a legal (ie profitable) model and suspend its legal assault on Napster's file-sharing operation. </p> <p>Why should this be of interest to the book business? Bertelsmann owns Random House, the largest book publishing company in the UK and US. It also owns the UK's largest book club operator, Book Club Associates, and the (second largest) online bookseller, Bol.com. </p> <p>Not only did the deal see Thomas Middelhoff, chairman of Bertelsmann, admit that \"file-sharing technology will be used in the future, no matter what the outcome of the lawsuit against Napster may be\", he added that the technology would open up \"in the medium term, an additional distribution channel... for our other content businesses\". </p> <p>The fact that Middelhoff has, so far, declined to comment further on what he meant by this statement should not be taken as an indication that he does not yet know how the technology will be used by Bertelsmann's book publishing companies. </p> <p><strong>Booker-bashing continues apace</strong></p> <p>And, finally, what of the Booker? This year's award, won by Margaret Atwood, has drawn the usual criticism for failing to inspire book buyers. While Booker-bashing has become a favourite pastime of literary journalists in need of a safe story, there is some truth to the latest round of carping. </p> <p>According to BookTrack, which records book sales in 4,600 outlets, only two titles - Atwood's The Blind Assassin and Azzopardi's The Hiding Place - have sold more than 1,000 copies since the shortlist was announced. Atwood has sold more than 6,000 and Azzopardi 1,007. Furthermore, despite the swathes of publicity devoted to the Booker shortlist, only one book is selling appreciably more copies now than it was in the week of the shortlist's announcement: Brian O'Doherty's The Desposition of Father McGreevy sold 363 copies last week, compared to 67 in the first week.

      "bodyText": "The spirit of popular revolt, perhaps inspired by the fuel protesters, has hit the book business. Small publishers across the country are starting to fight back against what they see as a threat to their livelihoods from Waterstone's, the nation's largest dedicated bookseller. The latest spat between the big W and its suppliers came in response to a letter sent out by Waterstone's to smaller publishers stating that, from this week, it would be buying in their titles at a new standard discount of 50% - an increase in some cases from 35%. Waterstone's said the new terms would be used regardless of whether publishers replied to its letter or not. Smaller publishers, many of whom already feel ill-disposed to the ailing retail chain, reacted as small publishers are wont to do when such demands are issued in this way: they threatened to withhold their books. Tiverton-based local publisher Halsgrove went a step further and issued a press release stating its reasons for suspending dealings with the bookseller and calling on its customers to support its stance. Accusing Waterstone's of the \"worst case of commercial arrogance\" it had come across, the publisher argued that the bookseller was \"attempting to dig themselves out of trouble\" by imposing the new terms and thereby making \"regional publishing unviable\". It is not the first time that Waterstone's has raised the ire of publishers and risked the loss of their titles and no doubt it will not be the last. Waterstone's defended itself in the trade press by arguing that it was losing money on these books and needed to \"professionalise\" its relationships with smaller publishers. Quite how Waterstone's interprets the word \"professionalise\" is anyone's guess but more puzzling still, given the level of accounting sophistication it would take to calculate the real cost of selling individual books, was the assertion that the bookseller was actually losing money on these titles. Still, if Waterstone's believes it can arrest the decline in the performance of its business by offering fewer books to its customers and going to war with its suppliers, who in the trade can argue? Birthday buy-out for John Smith Better news from across the border where bookseller John Smith &amp; Son celebrated its 249th year of independence by announcing that its present managing director, Willie Anderson, was to buy the business from its current chairman, Robert Clow and his family. The deal is something of a personal triumph for Anderson, one-time president of the Booksellers Association and a vociferous supporter of all things independent. Mr Anderson, who has been managing director of the chain since 1994, has overseen the business during a period of much needed retrenchment thanks to the expansion of the US chain Borders and Waterstone's into its territories. The fact that John Smith has survived in what Mr Anderson calls a \"volatile and uncertain\" market speaks volumes about the loyalty of its customers and the flexibility of its staff. The management buy-out will also be welcomed by those publishers who fear more power being placed in the hands of the large bookselling chains. Bertelsmann's not caught napping Meanwhile, in a galaxy far away, Bertelsmann has struck up a deal with Napster, the online peer-to-peer music-sharing renegade. Under the terms of the deal Bertelsmann will fund Napster's development into a legal (ie profitable) model and suspend its legal assault on Napster's file-sharing operation. Why should this be of interest to the book business? Bertelsmann owns Random House, the largest book publishing company in the UK and US. It also owns the UK's largest book club operator, Book Club Associates, and the (second largest) online bookseller, Bol.com. Not only did the deal see Thomas Middelhoff, chairman of Bertelsmann, admit that \"file-sharing technology will be used in the future, no matter what the outcome of the lawsuit against Napster may be\", he added that the technology would open up \"in the medium term, an additional distribution channel... for our other content businesses\". The fact that Middelhoff has, so far, declined to comment further on what he meant by this statement should not be taken as an indication that he does not yet know how the technology will be used by Bertelsmann's book publishing companies. Booker-bashing continues apace And, finally, what of the Booker? This year's award, won by Margaret Atwood, has drawn the usual criticism for failing to inspire book buyers. While Booker-bashing has become a favourite pastime of literary journalists in need of a safe story, there is some truth to the latest round of carping. According to BookTrack, which records book sales in 4,600 outlets, only two titles - Atwood's The Blind Assassin and Azzopardi's The Hiding Place - have sold more than 1,000 copies since the shortlist was announced. Atwood has sold more than 6,000 and Azzopardi 1,007. Furthermore, despite the swathes of publicity devoted to the Booker shortlist, only one book is selling appreciably more copies now than it was in the week of the shortlist's announcement: Brian O'Doherty's The Desposition of Father McGreevy sold 363 copies last week, compared to 67 in the first week. Some in the book trade suggest that concentrating on sales figures is missing the point of the Booker, which is supposed to award merit not saleability. Undoubtedly true, but if the nation's most talked about literary prize fails to inspire book readers to actually read the books in question then, it might seem reasonable to ask, what is the point? The fall-out from this year's slow sales could be interesting. Booksellers have complained of difficulties in getting hold of some of the titles on the list, while publishers have been disappointed by the promotion the shortlisted titles have received in some shops, not least from WH Smith which loudly announced earlier in the year that it was getting behind the Booker like never before. It seems too obvious to suggest that a lack of books will lead to a dearth in sales, but in a week in which entente cordiale between publishers and booksellers has been stretched to its limit, perhaps the trade should just enjoy the party and let others worry about the business of selling books.",

      "bodyText": "Waheed Alli will leave Carlton Communications today, it has been confirmed. The Labour peer, who was brought into Carlton after it acquired his Planet 24 production outfit, is said to be the victim of a restructuring at the ITV company. His departure, to be announced later today, was confirmed by a spokesman. He will spend more time in politics as the government prepares for the general election. Lord Alli joined Carlton's TV as the head of its production business just 18 months ago. Many questioned how he fitted into a company that already had a de facto production boss in former BBC executive Steve Hewlett. At the time many in the industry were surprised with the seniority of his position given that the company had only recently poached Hewlett from Channel 4. However his position in the company seemed assured and many believed he would outlive Hewlett because of his links to the Labour party. Lord Alli, who set up Planet 24 with his partner Charlie Parsons and Bob Geldof, is best known as one of the masterminds behind Channel 4's The Big Breakfast. He and Parsons also have the worldwide rights to Survive!, the reality game show that became a sensational hit in the US this summer.",

Recent examples include a 1997 survey by the Prisons Inspectorate which found that a quarter of young prisoners were homeless on reception; a 1998 Nacro research study of juveniles in young offender institutions, 60% of whom had unstable living conditions; and the Social Exclusion Unit's finding in the same year that half of rough sleepers had at some time been in a prison or remand centre. </p> <p>Young people leaving care are a particularly vulnerable group. Nearly two-thirds have moved to independent living by the age of 18 and most experience difficulties in coping. Up to 20% of young people leaving care experience homelessness within two years of leaving. Some 26% of all prisoners and 38% of those under 21 have been in care, compared with 2% of the general population. </p> <p>Offenders who are imprisoned often lose their homes. A recent large scale resettlement survey by Nacro found that 13% of prisoners were homeless before their sentence and a further 34% had lost homes through being in prison. Nearly half the sample was therefore at risk of being homeless on release.

One home office research study, which followed up nearly 600 men for two years after release, found that less than a third of those with homes to go to were reconvicted, compared with 69% of those with no home. </p> <p>There are many obstacles to housing offenders and those at risk of offending. These include the serious shortage of affordable rented accommodation; changes in benefit arrangements which have made it harder for single people with low incomes to find housing; and delays in processing housing benefit claims so that people can wait months before getting their benefit. </p> <p>Ex-offenders have also been affected by local authorities' greater powers to exclude potential tenants under the Housing Act 1996. Some authorities have used these powers to reduce ex-offenders' access to housing, in some cases taking a blanket approach to people with criminal records or to particular categories of offender.

In these instances it will be the volunteer who will have to pay for the check despite offering their time and skills for free.</p> <p>Research carried out by ICM on behalf of NCVO asked different age groups whether they would be discouraged from volunteering if they had to pay for the checks. Around half of all those questioned said they would be put off by charges. The highest proportion was found among 19-21 year olds (60%). This research clearly shows the significant impact that charges on criminal record checks will have on the number of people who will volunteer.</p> <p>So what will the total cost be? According to the NCVO's own research based on figures provided in recent parliamentary questions, the total cost will be around \u00a316m a year. Despite the damage these charges could do to the voluntary sector this cost would be small change to the public purse.</p> <p>In the run up to a general election, the NCVO has commissioned research looking at what charities and voluntary organisations are looking for in the political parties' election manifestos. The results showed that the vast majority want an increased role in delivering public services while receiving core funding from the government. It seems that charities are more ready than ever to work in equal and fair partnership with government and extend their responsibilities into areas that hitherto have been part of the state's sphere. </p> <p>However, I firmly believe that in order to achieve this goal, the government must foster an environment in which charities can prosper. Its failure to provide free criminal records checks for volunteers is just the kind of policy that hinders this process. The NCVO will be working with other organisations to co-ordinate a sustained parliamentary campaign to put pressure on them to do so.</p> <p>For more information on NCVO's parliamentary campaign for the introduction of free criminal record checks for volunteers, email Richard Hebditch on Richard.Hebditch@ncvo-vol.org.uk </p> <p>\u0095 Stuart Etherington is chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations</p> <p>What's your opinion?

Around half of all those questioned said they would be put off by charges. The highest proportion was found among 19-21 year olds (60%). This research clearly shows the significant impact that charges on criminal record checks will have on the number of people who will volunteer. So what will the total cost be? According to the NCVO's own research based on figures provided in recent parliamentary questions, the total cost will be around \u00a316m a year. Despite the damage these charges could do to the voluntary sector this cost would be small change to the public purse. In the run up to a general election, the NCVO has commissioned research looking at what charities and voluntary organisations are looking for in the political parties' election manifestos. The results showed that the vast majority want an increased role in delivering public services while receiving core funding from the government. It seems that charities are more ready than ever to work in equal and fair partnership with government and extend their responsibilities into areas that hitherto have been part of the state's sphere. However, I firmly believe that in order to achieve this goal, the government must foster an environment in which charities can prosper. Its failure to provide free criminal records checks for volunteers is just the kind of policy that hinders this process. The NCVO will be working with other organisations to co-ordinate a sustained parliamentary campaign to put pressure on them to do so. For more information on NCVO's parliamentary campaign for the introduction of free criminal record checks for volunteers, email Richard Hebditch on Richard.Hebditch@ncvo-vol.org.uk \u0095 Stuart Etherington is chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations What's your opinion?

      "bodyText": "It is a sign of the political times that the single most powerful individual in health, ministers aside, is Downing Street policy adviser Robert Hill: not a health professional or a civil servant, but a \"special adviser\" accountable only to his boss, prime minister Tony Blair. Mr Hill's writ runs large over health policy and yet he is virtually unknown outside Whitehall and Westminster. His influence will dramatically shape the future of the NHS, but neither he nor his employer is obliged to divulge anything about his work, his decisions or even himself. Women make up 80% of the NHS workforce, but none wield any serious power over health policy. The service may be undergoing its most radical changes for 50 years, but the people who influence this reform are, as ever, predominantly white, male and middle aged. The most influential woman in the NHS, the Royal College of Nursing general secretary Christine Hancock, has announced that she is to retire next summer - and there is no guarantee that her replacement will be a woman, let alone an individual with comparable stature and leverage. And while patients are rhetorically central to the NHS plan, no individual representing consumer interests is connected to high-level NHS power networks; rather, power is concentrated in the hands of central government and producer interests - the trade unions and professional associations. The presence of Paul Dacre, editor of the Daily Mail and tribune for middle England, is an indication of how powerful the media has become in directing the tone, timing and nature of government policy decisions and announcements. Health is no exception. The only ethnic minority power player is Chai Patel, a private health sector businessman of Indian parentage. Incidentally, he is the only individual in the top 15 to have made a registered donation to the Labour Party - he gave at least \u00a35,000 in 1999. The list contains some individuals who are arguably ciphers for institutional power. It is no disrespect to Alastair Bridges to assert that his influence depends on his role as field commander of the Treasury tank battalion currently parked on Department of Health lawns. Others, such as Professor George Alberti, transcend institutional power. As president of the Royal College of Physicians, his influence rests not there but as a trusted ministerial adviser and fixer who has credibility with the medical establishment. Analysis of the professional backgrounds of the NHS Power 15 reveals that medicine and NHS management supply most of the key players. Including Patel, there are five qualified doctors. Including Simon Stevens, and Hancock, there are five with NHS management experience. Of the 15, only Unison head of health Bob Abberley, who was a hospital operating theatre assistant, and Hancock, who was a nurse, have hands-on experience of the NHS outside medicine and management. Notable omissions from the top 15 are anyone with specialist expertise and influence in mental health, cancer, and heart disease - the government's three principle priorities for investment. The list is inevitably invidious. Powerful individuals who just missed the cut include: Sir Donald Irvine, chairman of the General Medical Council; Sir Richard Sykes, chairman of Glaxo Wellcome; and Dr Mac Armstrong, former British Medical Association secretary, now Scotland's chief medical officer. Not far behind comes Rabbi Julia Neuberger, director of the King's Fund health policy think tank; Ian Carruthers, chief executive of East Dorset health authority and doyen of NHS managers; Denise Platt, chief inspector of social services; and Mike Richards, NHS national cancer director. Finally, no list of powerful people would be complete without a conspiracy theory. Although there is no evidence of an actual conspiracy, an astonishing proportion of influential doctors come from health secretary Alan Milburn's and Blair's north-east stamping ground: Messrs Alberti, Rawlins, Donaldson and Irvine.

An injunction was obtained against Nel Lister, a friend of the Blairs' former nanny Ros Mark, who is writing a book about the Blair family. It was to have included claims the prime ministerial couple lacked parental control and proper personal security. Mrs Blair wanted to stop Mrs Lister revealing information she had learned from Ms Mark, who had signed a privacy agreement when she was employed. It is the latest step in the Blairs' battle to keep their domestic life private in a year when it has repeatedly been publicised. In July son Euan, 16, was found drunk in central London and in August was accused of rowdy behaviour in an Italian hotel. The Blairs were also criticised for trying to stop pictures of new baby Leo being published. At the beginning of the year Ms Mark, nanny for four years to Euan, Nicky and Kathryn, tried to publish her memoirs but was prevented by a court injunction. Mrs Lister, a 49-year-old friend of Ms Mark's family, yesterday gave a legal undertaking at the high court in London to hand over three computer disks containing material relating to the Blairs. But Mrs Lister was not willing to pass on her own research relating to Mrs Blair's response to the threat to her privacy, which Mrs Lister described as \"heavy-handed\". She refuted suggestions of trying to blackmail Mrs Blair after asking for \u00a340,000 in return for not publishing and to cover her expenses. The judge ruled that the material Mrs Lister had obtained from Ms Mark - which included references to the Blairs' \"alarming disregard to parental control\" and \"lack of personal security\" - fell within the confidentiality agreement which Ms Mark and her brother Thomas signed with the Blairs. The judge warned Mrs Lister that she would be in contempt if she did not comply with the order and would be at risk of going to prison.",

Joined the Downing Street policy unit team in May 1997. He is Tony Blair's trusted advisor on health. \"Blair and Hill share the same core beliefs on health,\" says one insider.</p> <p>Credited with coming up with initiatives such as NHS Direct and walk-in centres, and establishing a Daily Mail-friendly \"safety first\" approach to mental health policy, to the horror of the clinical establishment.</p> <p>He is Blair's emissary to the Department of Health (DoH), where he delivers high-voltage news of his master's dissatisfaction, and reputedly has the power to make or break ministerial careers.</p> <p>Quiet, intelligent, and regarded by some as aloof and pompous. \"When I knew him he was called Bob, and now its Robert,\" says one former union colleague. But no one questions his power. \"If it (a health policy idea) doesn't fit in his world view, it's unlikely to happen,\" claims one observer.</p> <p><strong>2. Nigel Crisp</strong><br> NHS chief executive<br><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/\">NHS.uk</a><br> Chief executive of both the NHS Executive and the DoH. The first NHS chief to combine the two posts, and therefore the first NHS chief with a seat among the power brokers at the civil service top table. Widely respected in the NHS management community, he arrived in his present job after the launch of the NHS plan, but responsibility for its implementation lies in his hands.</p> <p><strong>3. Sir George Alberti</strong><br> President, Royal College of Physicians<br><a href=\"http://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/\">Royal College of Physicians</a><br> Blair's modernising representative on Planet Consultant. Plugged into the higher level medical power networks, although his influence stretches further afield: he helped draw up the national health framework on coronary heart disease, sits on the NHS modernisation board, and advised ministers on the appointment of Nigel Crisp as NHS chief executive.</p> <p><strong>4. Simon Stevens</strong><br>Head of the strategic policy unit, Department of Health<br><a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk\">Department of Health</a><br> Career NHS manager turned policy advisor to both former health secretary Frank Dobson and incumbent Alan Milburn. The latter created a strategic policy unit in the DoH (possibly to counterbalance the influence of Number 10 and the Treasury), and made Stevens head of it. Worked closely on the NHS plan, now looking at health policy options for a second term of Labour government.</p> <p><strong>5. Professor Liam Donaldson</strong><br> Chief medical officer for England and Wales<br><a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/cmo/cmoh.htm\">DoH Chief Medical Officer</a><br> As the holder of the top doctor's post in England and Wales he is the clinical face of the DoH, and has immense influence on key public health issues (as the recent Phillips' report on the BSE crisis, which examined the role of his predecessors, made clear). As chief medical officer to the government, not just the DoH, he has serious reach across Whitehall, while his experience as a senior NHS manager gives him credibility in the NHS.</p> <p><strong>6.

If he can withstand furious counter-attacks from an outraged pharmaceutical industry lobby and the right-wing press (witness the furore over flu drug Relenza), he will have immense power to shape NHS clinical practice and investment decisions.</p> <p><strong>7. Alastair Bridges</strong><br> Head of Treasury health team<br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/index.html\">HM Treasury</a><br> The Treasury is increasingly influential on health policy, imposing the financial and performance framework in which the NHS operates, and - according to its critics - micro-managing the NHS in an unprecedented way.

      "bodyText": "1. Robert Hill Number 10 policy unit adviser on health 10 Downing Street \"We don't release information about Number 10 staff.\" The government is not required to tell us anything about the most powerful individual in the NHS. What we know is that he is a former theology student, one-time binman, National Union of Public Employees officer (he was active in the 1982 NHS strike, the longest in health service history), and Labour Party official. Joined the Downing Street policy unit team in May 1997. He is Tony Blair's trusted advisor on health. \"Blair and Hill share the same core beliefs on health,\" says one insider. Credited with coming up with initiatives such as NHS Direct and walk-in centres, and establishing a Daily Mail-friendly \"safety first\" approach to mental health policy, to the horror of the clinical establishment. He is Blair's emissary to the Department of Health (DoH), where he delivers high-voltage news of his master's dissatisfaction, and reputedly has the power to make or break ministerial careers. Quiet, intelligent, and regarded by some as aloof and pompous. \"When I knew him he was called Bob, and now its Robert,\" says one former union colleague. But no one questions his power. \"If it (a health policy idea) doesn't fit in his world view, it's unlikely to happen,\" claims one observer. 2. Nigel Crisp NHS chief executive NHS.uk Chief executive of both the NHS Executive and the DoH. The first NHS chief to combine the two posts, and therefore the first NHS chief with a seat among the power brokers at the civil service top table. Widely respected in the NHS management community, he arrived in his present job after the launch of the NHS plan, but responsibility for its implementation lies in his hands. 3. Sir George Alberti President, Royal College of Physicians Royal College of Physicians Blair's modernising representative on Planet Consultant. Plugged into the higher level medical power networks, although his influence stretches further afield: he helped draw up the national health framework on coronary heart disease, sits on the NHS modernisation board, and advised ministers on the appointment of Nigel Crisp as NHS chief executive. 4. Simon Stevens Head of the strategic policy unit, Department of Health Department of Health Career NHS manager turned policy advisor to both former health secretary Frank Dobson and incumbent Alan Milburn. The latter created a strategic policy unit in the DoH (possibly to counterbalance the influence of Number 10 and the Treasury), and made Stevens head of it. Worked closely on the NHS plan, now looking at health policy options for a second term of Labour government. 5. Professor Liam Donaldson Chief medical officer for England and Wales DoH Chief Medical Officer As the holder of the top doctor's post in England and Wales he is the clinical face of the DoH, and has immense influence on key public health issues (as the recent Phillips' report on the BSE crisis, which examined the role of his predecessors, made clear). As chief medical officer to the government, not just the DoH, he has serious reach across Whitehall, while his experience as a senior NHS manager gives him credibility in the NHS. 6. Professor Mike Rawlins Chair, National Institute for Clinical Excellence National Institute for Clinical Excellence Respected pharmacologist who brings clinical credibility to the job of deciding which drugs and treatments are cost-effective enough to be made available on the NHS. If he can withstand furious counter-attacks from an outraged pharmaceutical industry lobby and the right-wing press (witness the furore over flu drug Relenza), he will have immense power to shape NHS clinical practice and investment decisions. 7.

Influence also over long term care and social care policy through his many government committee appointments, including the NHS older people task force and the Cabinet Office better regulation task force. 9.

Bogle's position gives him the power to stall the government's ambitious project should his members revolt over plans to tighten regulation of doctors, or limit consultants' private earnings. 10. Paul Dacre Editor, Daily Mail Daily Mail The Mail's tales of impending NHS collapse are read and possibly believed by the millions who reside in that virtual geographical space known as middle England. Not the obvious newspaper of choice for NHS policy makers but its sallies into the healthcare arena cause tremors in the corridors of the DoH in a way that no other national media outlet can. 11. Peter Homa Chief executive, Commission for Health Improvement (CHI) Commission for Health Improvement Respected career manager and former head of government waiting list taskforce, now in charge of the nascent regulatory body aimed at driving up standards of NHS care.

      "bodyText": "Waheed Alli's departure from Carlton Communications follows a shake-up designed to streamline the ITV company's TV and media operations. It is believed the Labour peer decided to leave Carlton because he was not offered a new boardroom position overseeing production for ITV, as well as satellite and digital TV and online services. Lord Alli, who is managing director of Carlton Productions, hit the headlines recently after he masterminded the \u00a310m return to ITV of seventies motel soap Crossroads. The Crossroads revival was seen as a major triumph for Lord Alli who, like other executives before him, was determined to rid Carlton of its reputation for second-rate programming. In a restructuring to be announced later today a new executive board will be created, bringing together the cream of executives at Carlton Communications and Carlton TV. It is believed that Carlton will now redefine itself with a new management structure for content and channels. The new board will be headed up by Gerry Murphy, the recently installed chief executive of Carlton Communications, while Nigel Walmsley, chairman of Carlton TV and executive director of Carlton Communications, will be named deputy chief executive. Clive Jones, chief executive of Carlton TV will get a new role as chief executive of Carlton channels. Carlton TV director of programming Steve Hewlett is to continue with his current job. In an interview Lord Alli gave to the Financial Times three weeks ago, it was clear that he believed his future was intimately linked with that of the company. In words that have come back to haunt him, he told the paper of his long term plans. He said: \"I am a big enough character and confident enough to stop the corporate jobsworths destroying the culture of the company. There are stacks of corporate jobsworth people willing to strangle the creative culture out of companies - 'You may not have coloured walls. You have to have grey carpets.

      "body": "<p><strong> I Have a Dream by Neil Tonge </strong> (Hodder Wayland, \u00a38.50, 7-11 years) presents a chance encounter between a little boy and Martin Luther King. The illustrated narrative concentrates on the motivation behind his commitment to racial equality, and on the famous Montgomery bus boycott that triggered reform in the USA. This was not a man fighting for himself, but on behalf of all those segregated or discriminated against. Although specific in its remit, there is a distinct resonance with racial iniquity both at home and abroad. </p> <p><strong> I Was a Rat! ... or The Scarlet Slippers by Philip Pullman</strong> (Corgi \u00a33.99, 10+ yrs) is a chameleon of a story, shifting with every re-reading. As storytellers go, Pullman is among the best, and, although renowned for the deservedly feted His Dark Materials trilogy, this slimmer volume is no less ingenious. Plundering the world of traditional fairytale and adding some trenchant references to the unpalatable way in which the press can manipulate their readers, this story works on several levels and poses any number of conundrums about perceptions of ourselves and those around us. </p> <p><strong> Warlands by Rachel Anderson</strong> (OUP, \u00a35.99, 9-15 yrs) Accident of birth fascinates Anderson, whose books often look at how a quirk of nature dictates the direction of a life. Using experience of her own adopted son, Sang, the author tells a series of stories about Ho, a Vietnamese orphan whose history is unknown. A whole narrative and emotional framework must be created so he can take his place among the family. His abysmal behaviour strains their commitment, but through the stories they slowly provide a haven in which he thrives, secure in himself and with others. </p> <p><strong> Falling Awake by Vivian French</strong> (Barrington Stoke \u00a34.50, 11-16 yrs) Vivian French tackles the horrors of drug addiction head on, starting with a ghastly drug-induced nightmare. And it continues, even as reality and consciousness kicks in. The negative side-effects of drug-taking are made very clear, but the over-riding impression is of the drugs economy which, even on this local scale, targets the weakest. </p> <p><strong> The Monarchy by Emily Moore</strong> (What's the Big Idea? series, Hodder, \u00a33.99, 11-15yrs). Emily Moore gets her teeth into The Monarchy, subtitled 'National Treasure or a Right Royal Disgrace?' It is fairly clear in which direction she leans, but she avoids diatribe or blue-rinse defence. Historically and socially fascinating and entertainingly illustrated, there is fodder here for spirited debate about the nature of power and the accident of inherited status within a much broader context than simply the beleaguered Windsors. </p> <p><strong> Tommy Trouble by Stephen Potts </strong>(Mammoth \u00a33.99, 9-12 yrs) Theresa Breslin's Carnegie-winning Whispers in the Graveyard was ground-breaking in its exposure of the consequences of illiteracy - this book explores similar territory for a younger readership. Tommy is ridiculed by his teacher, bullied by his peers and largely ignored by his weary, lonely mother. A friendship with the old man he meets at the war memorial provides the incentive and support he needs to begin to explore the world of words. His journey is not neatly complete by the time this gentle story closes. Life will never be easy for Tommy. </p>",

      "bodyText": "I Have a Dream by Neil Tonge (Hodder Wayland, \u00a38.50, 7-11 years) presents a chance encounter between a little boy and Martin Luther King. The illustrated narrative concentrates on the motivation behind his commitment to racial equality, and on the famous Montgomery bus boycott that triggered reform in the USA. This was not a man fighting for himself, but on behalf of all those segregated or discriminated against. Although specific in its remit, there is a distinct resonance with racial iniquity both at home and abroad. I Was a Rat! ... or The Scarlet Slippers by Philip Pullman (Corgi \u00a33.99, 10+ yrs) is a chameleon of a story, shifting with every re-reading. As storytellers go, Pullman is among the best, and, although renowned for the deservedly feted His Dark Materials trilogy, this slimmer volume is no less ingenious. Plundering the world of traditional fairytale and adding some trenchant references to the unpalatable way in which the press can manipulate their readers, this story works on several levels and poses any number of conundrums about perceptions of ourselves and those around us. Warlands by Rachel Anderson (OUP, \u00a35.99, 9-15 yrs) Accident of birth fascinates Anderson, whose books often look at how a quirk of nature dictates the direction of a life. Using experience of her own adopted son, Sang, the author tells a series of stories about Ho, a Vietnamese orphan whose history is unknown. A whole narrative and emotional framework must be created so he can take his place among the family. His abysmal behaviour strains their commitment, but through the stories they slowly provide a haven in which he thrives, secure in himself and with others. Falling Awake by Vivian French (Barrington Stoke \u00a34.50, 11-16 yrs) Vivian French tackles the horrors of drug addiction head on, starting with a ghastly drug-induced nightmare. And it continues, even as reality and consciousness kicks in. The negative side-effects of drug-taking are made very clear, but the over-riding impression is of the drugs economy which, even on this local scale, targets the weakest. The Monarchy by Emily Moore (What's the Big Idea? series, Hodder, \u00a33.99, 11-15yrs). Emily Moore gets her teeth into The Monarchy, subtitled 'National Treasure or a Right Royal Disgrace?' It is fairly clear in which direction she leans, but she avoids diatribe or blue-rinse defence. Historically and socially fascinating and entertainingly illustrated, there is fodder here for spirited debate about the nature of power and the accident of inherited status within a much broader context than simply the beleaguered Windsors. Tommy Trouble by Stephen Potts (Mammoth \u00a33.99, 9-12 yrs) Theresa Breslin's Carnegie-winning Whispers in the Graveyard was ground-breaking in its exposure of the consequences of illiteracy - this book explores similar territory for a younger readership. Tommy is ridiculed by his teacher, bullied by his peers and largely ignored by his weary, lonely mother. A friendship with the old man he meets at the war memorial provides the incentive and support he needs to begin to explore the world of words. His journey is not neatly complete by the time this gentle story closes. Life will never be easy for Tommy.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The reports of the demise of press freedom in Hong Kong after the 1997 handover were greatly exaggerated - but there is now a new concern that Beijing may have started to lean more heavily.</p> <p>The most obvious sign of heavy-handedness came from the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, who blew his top recently at some persistent questioning from young Hong Kong reporters. \"I'm angry\", he shouted, accusing them of being \"too simple and naive\".</p> <p>Now Mr Jiang appears to have punished the Hong Kong media by barring access for them to a high profile event today across the border. Hong Kong's chief executive Tung Chee-hwa will attend a ceremony to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.</p> <p>Mr Tung will see Mr Jiang unveil a bronze statue to the former leader Deng Xiaoping, architect of the \"open-door policy\" under which Shenzhen has flourished.</p> <p>But journalists from Hong Kong are not invited, and there will not even be an official photographer to accompany Mr Tung. Mr Jiang, observers are suggesting, is \"still angry\".</p> <p>More serious worries have been raised by the resignation of Willy Wo-lap Lam, China editor of Hong Kong's main English-language newspaper, the South China Morning Post. The Post's China coverage has been seen as a litmus test of press freedom and so far has proved a good advertisement for official tolerance.</p> <p>Its Beijing-based correspondents regularly expose Chinese corruption in high places, while Mr Lam's commentaries have explored the inside story of top-level intrigue and contention within the Beijing leadership. Mr Lam has resigned after a staff reorganisation which gave his formal title to a former mainland Chinese journalist while inviting him to stay on as associate editor.</p> <p>This move, although justified in terms of expanding the Post's China coverage, came only a few months after Mr Lam had been publicly criticised by the paper's controlling shareholder, Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok Hock Nien.</p> <p>Mr Kuok was a member of a group of Hong Kong tycoons feted in Beijing by Mr Jiang. Mr Lam wrote a cutting commentary suggesting that they had been pressed to support Chief Executive Tung in return for economic favours.</p> <p>Mr Kuok denounced Mr Lam's commentary in a letter to his newspaper, backed a couple of days later by fellow-tycoons. Journalists from other countries acknowledge that a proprietor criticised in his own paper would have taken offence elsewhere too. It is the China connection which makes the affair especially sensitive.</p> <p>More than half the Post's editorial staff - 115 reporters and editors - have now signed a letter expressing their concern, and affirming their own commitment to editorial freedom.</p> <p>They say they deplore the way that Mr Lam was given the impression that he was being sidelined, \"especially in sensitive circumstances just a few months after the unprecedented public criticism of him by Mr Kuok;.\"</p> <p>Mr Lam believes that this is part of a move to \"depoliticise\" the Post's China coverage. Former Post editor Jonathan Fenby says that during his tenure he came under pressure from the Post proprietor to remove Mr Kuok.</p> <p>Tales of newspaper upheavals are rarely completely straightforward. Mr Lam was an incisive writer rather than an editorial manager and his replacement has wider responsibilities.

      "bodyText": "The reports of the demise of press freedom in Hong Kong after the 1997 handover were greatly exaggerated - but there is now a new concern that Beijing may have started to lean more heavily. The most obvious sign of heavy-handedness came from the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, who blew his top recently at some persistent questioning from young Hong Kong reporters. \"I'm angry\", he shouted, accusing them of being \"too simple and naive\". Now Mr Jiang appears to have punished the Hong Kong media by barring access for them to a high profile event today across the border. Hong Kong's chief executive Tung Chee-hwa will attend a ceremony to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. Mr Tung will see Mr Jiang unveil a bronze statue to the former leader Deng Xiaoping, architect of the \"open-door policy\" under which Shenzhen has flourished. But journalists from Hong Kong are not invited, and there will not even be an official photographer to accompany Mr Tung. Mr Jiang, observers are suggesting, is \"still angry\". More serious worries have been raised by the resignation of Willy Wo-lap Lam, China editor of Hong Kong's main English-language newspaper, the South China Morning Post. The Post's China coverage has been seen as a litmus test of press freedom and so far has proved a good advertisement for official tolerance. Its Beijing-based correspondents regularly expose Chinese corruption in high places, while Mr Lam's commentaries have explored the inside story of top-level intrigue and contention within the Beijing leadership. Mr Lam has resigned after a staff reorganisation which gave his formal title to a former mainland Chinese journalist while inviting him to stay on as associate editor. This move, although justified in terms of expanding the Post's China coverage, came only a few months after Mr Lam had been publicly criticised by the paper's controlling shareholder, Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok Hock Nien. Mr Kuok was a member of a group of Hong Kong tycoons feted in Beijing by Mr Jiang. Mr Lam wrote a cutting commentary suggesting that they had been pressed to support Chief Executive Tung in return for economic favours. Mr Kuok denounced Mr Lam's commentary in a letter to his newspaper, backed a couple of days later by fellow-tycoons. Journalists from other countries acknowledge that a proprietor criticised in his own paper would have taken offence elsewhere too. It is the China connection which makes the affair especially sensitive. More than half the Post's editorial staff - 115 reporters and editors - have now signed a letter expressing their concern, and affirming their own commitment to editorial freedom. They say they deplore the way that Mr Lam was given the impression that he was being sidelined, \"especially in sensitive circumstances just a few months after the unprecedented public criticism of him by Mr Kuok;.\" Mr Lam believes that this is part of a move to \"depoliticise\" the Post's China coverage. Former Post editor Jonathan Fenby says that during his tenure he came under pressure from the Post proprietor to remove Mr Kuok. Tales of newspaper upheavals are rarely completely straightforward. Mr Lam was an incisive writer rather than an editorial manager and his replacement has wider responsibilities. The Post's current editor Robert Keatley admits that the organisational changes \"could have been carried out with greater care and sensitivity\". The Post printed its own journalists' protest and a number of critical letters. It had allowed Mr Lam to stand by his original story after it was attacked by Mr Kuok. Yet in Hong Kong's very specific context of \"one country two systems\", such episodes are bound to be widely interpreted as threatening to undermine a very important feature of its own \"system\". Understandably, Mr Lam feels hard done by, and public opinion will only be re-assured if the Post's China coverage as a whole remains unaffected. And, of course, if President Jiang Zemin stops being angry....

      "bodyText": "William Hague took a first step towards tapping into English nationalism yesterday by unveiling plans to strip Scottish MPs of their rights to vote on matters south of the border. In a speech in Oxford, which has been widely condemned, the Tory leader promised to change House of Commons procedures to guarantee \"English votes on English laws\". Mr Hague warned that there was a danger of political instability unless the \"West Lothian question\" was tackled. The question was first posed by the Labour MP Tam Dalyell who warned devolution would create an anomaly in which Scottish MPs could vote on matters in England, while English MPs would have no vote on matters in Scotland. Mr Hague said the anomaly had already arisen after Scottish Labour MSPs voted for one form of tuition fees north of the border, while voting, as Westminster MPs for a different system in England. He said: \"We saw what happened when the Scottish people felt the poll tax had been imposed on them by an English majority. Reverse the situation and add the West Lothian dimension and you have an explosive situation. Ignore English consciousness, or bottle it up, and it could turn into dangerous nationalism.\" Mr Hague, who also pledged to reduce the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster, cast his speech as a constructive attempt to stem growing English nationalism since the establishment of the Scottish parliament. His remarks show the Tories believe there are votes to be had south of the border from those who think England got a raw deal over devolution. The Tory leader also said Britain could face a constitutional crisis if Labour were beaten in England, but won a majority at Westminster on the basis of Scottish and Welsh MPs. Mr Hague's speech was condemned last night by the Liberal Democrats as \"a petty attempt to seek revenge on the voters who rejected them\". Alasdair Morgan, the SNP's Westminster group leader, described the move as \"typical Tory anti-Scottishness\".",

      "bodyText": "Coca-Cola is to retain Universal McCann as its UK media buying agency. This morning's announcement may signal an end to months of speculation surrounding the future of the drink giant's entire roster of agency partners, including media, creative and PR. In June, Coke asked its three European creative agencies to pitch for a Europe-wide branding campaign for its brands, which include Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper, Fanta and Lilt. It will be the first time in recent history that its brands' European advertising will be created locally rather than imported from the US. Senior players at each agency are still awaiting a decision from Coke, with many beginning to doubt that the company itself knows the best way forward. A media review was announced a few months later. Further question marks hung over its UK roster of agencies as Coke began to appoint work to non-roster companies. PR was then said to be under the microscope. Recent US campaigns to be imported to the UK include \"Coca Cola. Enjoy\" and \"Always Coca Cola\". But senior executives at Coke have increasingly called for a more local approach and greater freedom for marketing executives to do what's right for their own markets. BBJ's associated companies, Carat Insight and Carat Interactive, have now been appointed to handle media planning. Charlotte Oades, Coca-Cola's UK and Ireland marketing director, said: \"Universal McCann will now be working with BBJ/Carat and together they will give us an even greater depth of consumer and media insight and more innovative and creative media planning. \"Given the dramatic expansion of our media mix and the new technologies we are exploring, this configuration will serve our needs best.\" Meanwhile, Coke has also retained Wieden &amp; Kennedy to handle its diet Coke business.

Ist Lesen so popul\u00e4r wie fr\u00fcher? Werden wir bald kein Buch mehr aufschlagen, sondern statt dessen den Computer anschalten und uns die Schriftst\u00fccke auf den Bildschirm laden? </p> <p> <strong> Was haltet Ihr [ihr] von Harry Potter? </strong></p> <p><strong> Nicola (12): </strong> Ich finde ihn einfach <strong>genial</strong>. Er wei\u00df immer eine L\u00f6sung, ist witzig und sieht auch noch nett aus. Den w\u00fcrde ich gerne mal in Wirklichkeit kennenlernen. </p> <p> <strong> Frank (15): </strong> Ich habe alle vier B\u00e4nde gelesen. Jeder war so spannend wie der andere. Ich konnte die B\u00fccher nicht mehr weglegen. Und das ist schon was, denn <strong> normalerweise</strong> lese ich nicht so gerne. </p> <p> <strong> Peter (13): </strong> Ich war vor kurzem auf einer Harry-Potter-Party im Buchladen. Das war, als der neue Band ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde. Ich fand es total gut, mit den anderen Fans zu reden. Wir haben uns ausgedacht, wie es weitergehen k\u00f6nnte. </p> <p> <strong> Lest Ihr [ihr] oft? Und welche B\u00fccher gefallen Euch [euch] am besten? </strong></p> <p><strong>Luca (18): </strong> Ich habe fr\u00fcher oft gelesen. Jetzt mu\u00df [muss] ich gerade mehr f\u00fcr die Schule lernen. Da bleibt leider kaum Zeit. </p> <p> <strong> Ariane (14): </strong> Was mir gef\u00e4llt, \u00e4ndert sich st\u00e4ndig. Fr\u00fcher waren es Tiergeschichten. Jetzt lese ich gerne Zukunftsromane. Das ist witzig, weil man sich vorstellen kann, was davon einmal wahr wird. </p> <p> <strong> Nicola: </strong> Nun ja, Phantasiegeschichten wie die von Harry Potter mag ich am liebsten. In diesen B\u00fcchern kommen immer ganz besondere Wesen vor. Jetzt soll es ja auch einen Harry-Potter-Film geben. Ich bin neugierig, wie diese Tiere und Menschen dann im Kino aussehen. </p> <p> <strong> Von vielen B\u00fcchern gibt es Leseproben im Internet. Lest Ihr [ihr] sie manchmal? </strong> </p> <p><strong>Ariane: </strong> Nein. Das ist mir zu <strong> umst\u00e4ndlich</strong> . Lieber h\u00f6re ich mich bei Freundinnen um, was sie gerade lesen. Und wenn sie ein Buch gut finden, leihe oder kaufe ich es mir. Bis ich die Internet-Seiten aufgerufen habe, das dauert mir viel zu lange. </p> <p> <strong> Peter: </strong> Den neuen Harry-Potter habe ich mir \u00fcber das Internet bestellt. Ich habe aber keine einzige Zeile vorher gelesen. Es h\u00e4tte mich dann nur <strong> ge\u00e4rgert</strong> , da\u00df [dass] ich am Ende der Leseprobe nicht gewu\u00dft [gewusst] h\u00e4tte, wie es weitergeht. </p> <p> <strong> Luca: </strong> Das habe ich ehrlich gesagt noch nie getan. Entweder ich will lesen oder im Internet surfen. Ich habe auch noch nie ein Buch \u00fcber das Internet gekauft. In einen Laden zu gehen und dort zwischen den Regalen zu st\u00f6bern - dieses Gef\u00fchl kann das Internet nie ersetzen. </p> <p> <strong> Also haben elektronische B\u00fccher auch keine Chance? </strong></p> <p><strong>Ariane: </strong> Das kann man so nicht sagen. Wenn ich in meiner Freizeit lese, m\u00f6chte ich das nicht vor dem Computer tun. Das ist ungem\u00fctlich. Aber Fachliteratur f\u00fcr die Schule oder den Beruf w\u00fcrde ich schon am PC lesen. </p> <p> <strong> Frank: </strong> Doch, haben sie schon. Wenn ich daran denke, wieviel elektronische B\u00fccher man auf einem Laptop speichern kann. Und diese B\u00fccher kann man \u00fcberall mitnehmen. Und das, ohne viel zu <strong> schleppen</strong> . </p> <p> <strong> Luca: </strong> Elektronik wird in unserem Leben eine immer gr\u00f6\u00dfere Rolle spielen. Und wahrscheinlich <strong> macht</strong> diese Entwicklung vor dem Buch nicht <strong> halt</strong> [Halt]. Es tut mir leid [Leid], aber ich kann es nicht \u00e4ndern. </p> <p> <strong> Ist Lesen unpopul\u00e4r geworden, weil es zu viele andere Dinge gibt, die man in seiner Freizeit tun kann?</strong> </p> <p><strong>Nicola: </strong> Kinder finden Lesen immer noch toll. Und Erwachsene auch, glaube ich. Man braucht niemanden dazu, man lernt dabei und man kann <strong> abschalten</strong> . </p> <p> <strong> Peter: </strong> Nat\u00fcrlich gehe ich auch mal ins Kino, spiele am Computer oder schaue Fernsehen. Dann habe ich eben einfach keine Lust zum Lesen. Das liegt aber nicht daran, da\u00df [dass] es zu viele andere Freizeit besch\u00e4ftigungen gibt. Man hat eben nicht immer <strong> Bock</strong> auf das gleiche. </p> <p> <strong> Luca: </strong> Wenn man an ganz fr\u00fcher denkt, an unsere Gro\u00dfeltern: die hatten auch nicht mehr Zeit als wir. Nur lag das nicht daran, da\u00df [dass] es so viele Dinge gab, die man tun konnte.

Werden wir bald kein Buch mehr aufschlagen, sondern statt dessen den Computer anschalten und uns die Schriftst\u00fccke auf den Bildschirm laden? Was haltet Ihr [ihr] von Harry Potter? Nicola (12): Ich finde ihn einfach genial. Er wei\u00df immer eine L\u00f6sung, ist witzig und sieht auch noch nett aus. Den w\u00fcrde ich gerne mal in Wirklichkeit kennenlernen. Frank (15): Ich habe alle vier B\u00e4nde gelesen. Jeder war so spannend wie der andere. Ich konnte die B\u00fccher nicht mehr weglegen. Und das ist schon was, denn normalerweise lese ich nicht so gerne. Peter (13): Ich war vor kurzem auf einer Harry-Potter-Party im Buchladen. Das war, als der neue Band ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde. Ich fand es total gut, mit den anderen Fans zu reden. Wir haben uns ausgedacht, wie es weitergehen k\u00f6nnte. Lest Ihr [ihr] oft? Und welche B\u00fccher gefallen Euch [euch] am besten? Luca (18): Ich habe fr\u00fcher oft gelesen. Jetzt mu\u00df [muss] ich gerade mehr f\u00fcr die Schule lernen. Da bleibt leider kaum Zeit. Ariane (14): Was mir gef\u00e4llt, \u00e4ndert sich st\u00e4ndig. Fr\u00fcher waren es Tiergeschichten. Jetzt lese ich gerne Zukunftsromane. Das ist witzig, weil man sich vorstellen kann, was davon einmal wahr wird. Nicola: Nun ja, Phantasiegeschichten wie die von Harry Potter mag ich am liebsten. In diesen B\u00fcchern kommen immer ganz besondere Wesen vor. Jetzt soll es ja auch einen Harry-Potter-Film geben. Ich bin neugierig, wie diese Tiere und Menschen dann im Kino aussehen. Von vielen B\u00fcchern gibt es Leseproben im Internet. Lest Ihr [ihr] sie manchmal? Ariane: Nein. Das ist mir zu umst\u00e4ndlich . Lieber h\u00f6re ich mich bei Freundinnen um, was sie gerade lesen. Und wenn sie ein Buch gut finden, leihe oder kaufe ich es mir. Bis ich die Internet-Seiten aufgerufen habe, das dauert mir viel zu lange. Peter: Den neuen Harry-Potter habe ich mir \u00fcber das Internet bestellt. Ich habe aber keine einzige Zeile vorher gelesen. Es h\u00e4tte mich dann nur ge\u00e4rgert , da\u00df [dass] ich am Ende der Leseprobe nicht gewu\u00dft [gewusst] h\u00e4tte, wie es weitergeht. Luca: Das habe ich ehrlich gesagt noch nie getan. Entweder ich will lesen oder im Internet surfen. Ich habe auch noch nie ein Buch \u00fcber das Internet gekauft. In einen Laden zu gehen und dort zwischen den Regalen zu st\u00f6bern - dieses Gef\u00fchl kann das Internet nie ersetzen. Also haben elektronische B\u00fccher auch keine Chance? Ariane: Das kann man so nicht sagen. Wenn ich in meiner Freizeit lese, m\u00f6chte ich das nicht vor dem Computer tun. Das ist ungem\u00fctlich. Aber Fachliteratur f\u00fcr die Schule oder den Beruf w\u00fcrde ich schon am PC lesen. Frank: Doch, haben sie schon. Wenn ich daran denke, wieviel elektronische B\u00fccher man auf einem Laptop speichern kann. Und diese B\u00fccher kann man \u00fcberall mitnehmen. Und das, ohne viel zu schleppen . Luca: Elektronik wird in unserem Leben eine immer gr\u00f6\u00dfere Rolle spielen. Und wahrscheinlich macht diese Entwicklung vor dem Buch nicht halt [Halt]. Es tut mir leid [Leid], aber ich kann es nicht \u00e4ndern. Ist Lesen unpopul\u00e4r geworden, weil es zu viele andere Dinge gibt, die man in seiner Freizeit tun kann? Nicola: Kinder finden Lesen immer noch toll. Und Erwachsene auch, glaube ich. Man braucht niemanden dazu, man lernt dabei und man kann abschalten . Peter: Nat\u00fcrlich gehe ich auch mal ins Kino, spiele am Computer oder schaue Fernsehen. Dann habe ich eben einfach keine Lust zum Lesen. Das liegt aber nicht daran, da\u00df [dass] es zu viele andere Freizeit besch\u00e4ftigungen gibt. Man hat eben nicht immer Bock auf das gleiche. Luca: Wenn man an ganz fr\u00fcher denkt, an unsere Gro\u00dfeltern: die hatten auch nicht mehr Zeit als wir. Nur lag das nicht daran, da\u00df [dass] es so viele Dinge gab, die man tun konnte. Es lag daran, da\u00df [dass] sie so viel arbeiten mu\u00dften [mussten]. Glossar/Glossary abschalten: to switch off (mentally and physically) sich \u00e4rgern to be annoyed Bock haben (coll.) to like to do sth. genial ingenious haltmachen [Halt machen] to stop die Lesewut reading mania normalerweise normally, generally schleppen (coll.) to carry a heavy weight umst\u00e4ndlich tedious, ineffective der Zauberer wizard",

But the controversy released an avalanche of words and raised issues that are still being discussed by academics and journalists. Masson himself, though, has left it all behind. As something of an antidote to all this, he has turned his attention to animals - with considerable success. \"To some extent I got sick of people,\" he says. \"You know, I'd been a psychoanalyst and I'd had a very unpleasant experience, to put it mildly, with the world of established psychoanalysis. And it really made me question that if these are the people who are supposed to be our mentors, the people who are treating people who are not mentally well, then there is something seriously wrong either with the criteria of mental health and the training or with our species. Yes... to some extent turning to animals was a result of being somewhat disillusioned.\" </p> <p>So from being a succ\u00e8s de scandale in the intellectual salons of Europe and New York, Masson moved along to become a box office bestseller with When Elephants Weep: the Emotional Lives of Animals, written with Susan McCarthy, which got on the New York Times bestseller list and sold half a million copies. It was quickly followed by Dogs Never Lie About Love: Reflections on the Emotional Lives of Dogs, which was equally successful. His latest book, just published in Britain, is The Emperor's Embrace: Fatherhood in Evolution. </p> <p>The title derives from the paternal devotion of the emperor penguin, an inhabitant of the bleakly hostile ice continent of Antarctica who takes guardianship of his mate's unhatched egg throughout the endless night and sub-zero temperatures of the deepest antarctic winter. The hatching rookeries are beyond the reach of all but the most intrepid. Masson, a dedicated Californian, didn't actually go to Antarctica to observe them: \"Too cold, too forbidding\". The embrace of these particular emperors is reserved for the times when the environment is at its most cruel. To describe how the birds protect their young in a collaborative and supportive shield would be, in a way, to reveal the narrative drive. But the story is a dramatic celebration of fatherhood and dads everywhere should be cheered by its heroism. </p> <p>Masson says he wrote it because, at the age of 55, he was about to become a father for the second time. He'd read a lot of books about becoming a father the first time round and found them inadequate then. This time he wondered if things had improved. They hadn't. </p> <p>It seemed like an opportunity to do something - and to do it rather differently by writing about animal fathers. \"It is a topic never written about. There are a few scholarly books and articles but generally very little about what kind of fathers animals are.\" </p> <p>What he did find on the subject seemed to endorse a generally held belief that male animals have no interest in children. He set out to test the hypothesis. \"One of the questions I thought I might be able to answer, but I haven't, is whether there's a tremendous variation within a species as there is within us. We run the whole gamut from wonderful fathers to terrible fathers. I wondered if animal species do too.\" </p> <p>What he found was that most scientists didn't even like the question. \"I have to say all of my books have been badly reviewed by the scientific community. They don't like them.\" </p> <p>Masson concedes that some of the criticism is valid. He's not a scientist. Much of what he writes is speculative and he readily admits he is \"simply regurgitating what other people have said and putting another slant on it\". But he insists that the questions he asks about the emotional life of animals are legitimate and deserve scientific investigation. </p> <p>\"I think it is hard,\" he says, \"for some people to give up the idea that we are the pinnacle of creation. Underlying it [the criticism] is 'how dare he, or anyone, compare us humans to these mere animals'. And I think people who do painful things to some other creature do not want to be told that that creature is their superior.\" </p> <p>When Masson wrote his second bestseller it was to \"make a really strong case for a most outrageous thesis, namely that dogs feel more profoundly than we do\". He believes it, even if some critics think he is insane. </p> <p> To make the point he does a creditable imitation of the reception he gets when he meets his German shepherd, Sasha - now living with his ex-wife Terri and daughter, Simone, in Oakland, California - after six month's absence. The urgent crying and howling noises accompanied by ecstatic wriggling and rolling around is familiar to most dog owners. \"It doesn't take a scientist to see that she's having a deeply emotional response to seeing me again,\" says Masson. \"So for anyone to say there's nothing going on in her mind at that point is insane. We don't know exactly what, that's true. But then I don't know exactly what is going through your mind as you listen to me either.\" </p> <p>That's true, too. What I'm thinking is that New Zealand is closer to the Antarctic and the emperor penguin than anywhere else in the world, excepting the barren wastes of Tierra del Fuego and Cape Horn. It is tempting to speculate that Masson's admiration of the giant bird has drawn him to this group of small islands in the South Pacific. </p> <p>But the reasons are more emotional than scientific. He and his German-born wife, paediatrician Leila Siller and their four-year- old son, Ilan, simply fell in love with New Zealand.

There are 41 shopping days left to Christmas - that's including Sundays, which, unless you live on Oxford Street, don't really count because we don't want anything from Woolworths or Halfords. Lose Sundays, and you only have 35 days. </p> <p>Now, you think that's a lot don't you? You're secretly rather thrilled, in fact, that despite the reappearance of plastic reindeer on your nearest high street, Christmas is still well over a month away. Which means you don't have to think about it yet. </p> <p>Wrong. Why not break the habits of a lifetime? While you're at it, why not break the habits of the brotherhood of man? Stop being so entirely crap and get your partner/spouse/girlfriend a decent Christmas present for a change. </p> <p>You think I'm making a sweeping generalisation, don't you? That you can't judge all men by the mistakes of a few. Wrong again. Even among the random selection of friends that happened to be on the end of a phone at 4.30pm yesterday, I can deliver an impressive list of totally undesirable gifts. </p> <p>Last year, Bun got two (really horrible) fleeces from a farming supplies shop; Jane, a concrete mixer complete with red satin bow (\"he thought it would be useful\"); Stef, a bunch of flowers from a petrol station (she dumped him); Ciara, a ceiling mobile that had previously belonged to her boyfriend and was stuck to the ceiling of the flat that they shared; Elaine received earrings (when she doesn't have pierced ears); Jacqui, a boxed set of Van Morrison CDs (I would definitely have left him for that); and my personal best was membership of the AA. </p> <p>As Lisa put it: \"I don't need the Christians' festive reminder to 'put Christ back into Christmas'. Each year when I open the present from my boyfriend - it's right there on the tip of my tongue - 'Gardening gloves? Christ!' \" </p> <p>But all of this doesn't apply to you, right? You're a shrewd shopper who has developed a keen intuition for what your partner would really like for Christmas. The deep-fat fryer/cashmere lookalike sweater/black-and-red peephole bra that she got last year was just what she wanted. She said so. </p> <p>The trouble with women though, is that they probably wouldn't tell you even if they didn't like it. In the first flush of a new relationship she'll want to protect your feelings. In the second or third flush of an old relationship she'll be saving up her post-Christmas-gift-anticlimax to use in a row at a later date. Around about July time, you'll be midway through an argument when she'll say: \"No I haven't lost the car keys again. And another thing. Your Christmas present was shit.\" </p> <p>You can avoid all this, once you've admitted to yourself that you have no clue how a woman's mind works when it comes to presents. You may have a perfectly legitimate reason for choosing a particular gift, but women may not see things in the same way. You buy her a fabulous candle, a superfast car, some silk underwear, or a Magimix juice extractor - what more could she possibly want? But for women, these gifts fall into four revealing categories which are: </p> <p>1. The impersonal gift - any number of meaningless objects whose proximity to the front doors of many department stores means they smack of indifference. A candle isn't a present, it's the means by which you'll find the bottle opener during next winter's power cut. Related gifts: potpourri, miniature soaps, wooden carvings, silk scarves, perfume. </p> <p>2. The vicarious gift. The 25-piece DIY set you've had on your wish list for years isn't really for her is it? Nor is the sports car. Nor is the boxed set of Men Behaving Badly videos or the weekend away in the Black Forest at a classic car show. </p> <p>3. The innuendo gift. Here's the trickiest one for men to get their heads around. If you buy your partner sexy underwear, she'll decide that you think she's a slut or that you wished that she was a slut. Buy her a dress that's too big and she'll decide you think she's fatter than she is or that you wish she was. Choose diamond earrings and she'll be certain you think she's either flash trash or a gold digger. Clothes, jewellery, underwear - don't touch it. </p> <p>4. The housewifey gift. Anything for the kitchen is just plain naff. Women don't want what they need, they want what they don't need. A set of 16 kitchen knives may well be used against you at a later date. Also see bathroom accessories, cookery books, shoe trees and clothes dryers. </p> <p>So how is a bloke supposed to get his partner a present that she really, really wants? Unless you can persuade her to drop Father Christmas a line, the answer to your Christmas present dilemma lies with your partner's best mate. Give her a call, set aside an afternoon and have a wee shop. Don't leave it until the last minute and make sure that you give her plenty of time to have a conversation with your partner first. </p> <p>In the meantime, ladies - start dreaming up your list.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the three women who have made it to the top in advertising claims that the industry will always be hell for mothers. \"Men like to have it all,\" said Christine Walker of Walker Media. \"In the final analysis women will not get away from the issue of juggling career and children. \"It's tough as hell and you have to be prepared to work bloody long hours. I've succeeded because I am totally insensitive. It never occurs to me that I can't achieve something. I am deeply ambitious. \"I can see why women may not want to work in media agencies - media owners are dominated by men. There is a very laddish culture where people are expected to work hard and play hard.\" Success, said Ms Walker, can be measured by women's level of commitment to the business. \"In order to be successful you have to network. You have to be out every night and for most women the priorities lie elsewhere.\" But women interviewed by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising believe that a glass ceiling still exists, no matter how hard you work. \"I find it depressing beyond belief that whether we like it or not, the glassy bit is still there,\" one female executive told the surveyors.",

According to the damning report, which is published later this month, the industry is failing to attract enough high-calibre women and runs the risk of losing what female talent it has. Findings from the latest Women in Advertising study from the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising will reveal that while women make up half of the number of employees in advertising, only 9% make it into senior management. Only three women out of thousands have made it to the very top. Christine Walker of Walker Media, MT Rainey of Rainey Kelly Campbell Roalfe/Y&amp;R and Amanda Walsh of Walsh Trott Chick Smith are the only women who have their names above the door of a top 50 advertising or media agency. The IPA survey found that attitudes towards women in the sector have improved little over the past 10 years. Four in 10 women say they felt they were discriminated against with 18% of those citing lack of family-friendly employee policies. A common complaint was offensive language - being referred to as a girl or being subjected to comments about dress. Women also complained that men made assumptions about them having children and that they were often not invited to agency outings because they involved sport. \"If we lived in the States, there'd be lawsuits all over the place.

      "body": "<p>Four hundred foetuses which were miscarried, stillborn or aborted have been discovered stored without their parents' consent at Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool, it has emerged.. </p> <p>All but 80 of the foetuses originated from two maternity hospitals in the city, which merged five years ago to form the Liverpool women's hospital. The others are from other hospitals around the north west. </p> <p>The foetuses, which range in development from early pregnancy to almost full term, were sent to Alder Hey for post mortem examinations between 1988 and 1995, because it provided a pathology service. </p> <p>Alder Hey hospital is already the subject of an independent inquiry into the issue of the organ retention of 893 babies and children. It was ordered by the health secretary, Alan Milburn, last year. Ministers received a copy last week of the inquiry report from Michael Redfern QC. </p> <p>Dick van Velzen, the pathologist at the centre of the organ retention scandal, is believed to have been responsible for storing the foetuses. The families were not told that they had been retained. </p> <p>Ian Cohen, a solicitor representing many of the families affected by organ retention, said they had been making discreet inquiries about the foetuses over the past four weeks. </p> <p>\"It now transpires that there is in fact a collection and, more worryingly, it seems to be directly connected to the period when Professor van Velzen was in charge of postmortems at Alder Hey,\" he said. </p> <p>His colleague, Raymond Goodman, said: \"We have for some time been requesting full information as to exactly what has gone on in relation to these foetuses, upon what authority they have been retained and what research has been carried out.\" </p> <p>But the NHS executive in the north west accused Pity II, the parents' support group, of another attempt to put the boot into Alder Hey. </p> <p>\"There is nothing new or newsworthy about this story,\" said its spokesman, Hugh Lamont. \"It has been looked at by the inquiry - it is not a secret.\" </p> <p>He said the revelation formed part of the terms of reference of Alder Hey's special incident project board, set up this year, which includes members of Pity II. It was discussed at a meeting in July. </p> <p>Kate Jackson, the project director of Alder Hey's serious incident team, said the hospital was aware that a number of foetuses had been retained. \"We do not contact families proactively,\" she said. \"Many families will not want to be reminded. We do rely on parents to contact the hospital.\" </p> <p>She said any families who had been affected would be offered the same support and counselling as other families whose children's organs were retained following their death at Alder Hey.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Four hundred foetuses which were miscarried, stillborn or aborted have been discovered stored without their parents' consent at Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool, it has emerged.. All but 80 of the foetuses originated from two maternity hospitals in the city, which merged five years ago to form the Liverpool women's hospital. The others are from other hospitals around the north west. The foetuses, which range in development from early pregnancy to almost full term, were sent to Alder Hey for post mortem examinations between 1988 and 1995, because it provided a pathology service. Alder Hey hospital is already the subject of an independent inquiry into the issue of the organ retention of 893 babies and children. It was ordered by the health secretary, Alan Milburn, last year. Ministers received a copy last week of the inquiry report from Michael Redfern QC. Dick van Velzen, the pathologist at the centre of the organ retention scandal, is believed to have been responsible for storing the foetuses. The families were not told that they had been retained. Ian Cohen, a solicitor representing many of the families affected by organ retention, said they had been making discreet inquiries about the foetuses over the past four weeks. \"It now transpires that there is in fact a collection and, more worryingly, it seems to be directly connected to the period when Professor van Velzen was in charge of postmortems at Alder Hey,\" he said. His colleague, Raymond Goodman, said: \"We have for some time been requesting full information as to exactly what has gone on in relation to these foetuses, upon what authority they have been retained and what research has been carried out.\" But the NHS executive in the north west accused Pity II, the parents' support group, of another attempt to put the boot into Alder Hey. \"There is nothing new or newsworthy about this story,\" said its spokesman, Hugh Lamont. \"It has been looked at by the inquiry - it is not a secret.\" He said the revelation formed part of the terms of reference of Alder Hey's special incident project board, set up this year, which includes members of Pity II. It was discussed at a meeting in July. Kate Jackson, the project director of Alder Hey's serious incident team, said the hospital was aware that a number of foetuses had been retained. \"We do not contact families proactively,\" she said. \"Many families will not want to be reminded. We do rely on parents to contact the hospital.\" She said any families who had been affected would be offered the same support and counselling as other families whose children's organs were retained following their death at Alder Hey.",

      "body": "<p>The government has said that policy and practice development should revolve around the needs of patients and services users. There is no greater need for this than in mental health services. </p> <p>But a new Mind survey on patients' views of conditions in psychiatric wards, titled Environmentally Friendly?, highlights patients' dissatisfaction with their treatment. </p> <p>The national service framework for mental health emphasises meeting people's needs with safe, sound and supportive services. It promotes ten core principles focusing on service users including:</p> <p>\u0095 Principle 3, which calls for services that respond to the needs of different groups and individuals and challenges discrimination on the grounds of age, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability and sexuality. It encourages NHS staff to treat patients as individuals and with dignity.</p> <p>\u0095 Principle 8, which states that the health and social care system must be shaped around the needs of patients or service users - not the other way around. It calls for the health service to develop partnerships and co-operation at all levels of care. That means developing partnerships between patients, their carers and families and NHS staff; between the health and social care sectors; between government departments; between the public sector and between voluntary organisations and private providers.</p> <p>The NHS plan shows that the government is committed to enhance patient care. For those who deliver the services, the challenge is translating this policy into real improvements in care and treatment. </p> <p>Environmentally Friendly? does not leave out the positive experiences of mental health service users, and these cases are worth noting, given the stretch of most hard-pressed and dedicated staff in meeting a growing need.</p> <p>However, for many mental health service users, the government's rhetoric is a long way from the reality. The report highlights an unacceptable incidence of non-therapeutic environments in psychiatric wards. Service users report feeling unsafe, unheard and unaffected by the plethora of well intended legislation. </p> <p>Mind welcomes the government's emphasis on outcome-focused change, for example, its guidance recently issued to health authorities and trusts on Cleanliness in Hospitals (NHSE, July 2000).</p> <p>But if user services are to improve, mental health staff need to make changes in the way they monitor and report interaction with their clients. Clinical governance development plans, which are meant to reflect improvement, should make a stronger impact in the services. And it is crucial that patients spell out their requirements for quality services. </p> <p>For providers, it is a challenge, but one which is well worth the engagement, because - as many mental health service users will tell you - the stakes are high.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government has said that policy and practice development should revolve around the needs of patients and services users. There is no greater need for this than in mental health services. But a new Mind survey on patients' views of conditions in psychiatric wards, titled Environmentally Friendly?, highlights patients' dissatisfaction with their treatment. The national service framework for mental health emphasises meeting people's needs with safe, sound and supportive services. It promotes ten core principles focusing on service users including: \u0095 Principle 3, which calls for services that respond to the needs of different groups and individuals and challenges discrimination on the grounds of age, gender, ethnicity, religion, disability and sexuality. It encourages NHS staff to treat patients as individuals and with dignity. \u0095 Principle 8, which states that the health and social care system must be shaped around the needs of patients or service users - not the other way around. It calls for the health service to develop partnerships and co-operation at all levels of care. That means developing partnerships between patients, their carers and families and NHS staff; between the health and social care sectors; between government departments; between the public sector and between voluntary organisations and private providers. The NHS plan shows that the government is committed to enhance patient care. For those who deliver the services, the challenge is translating this policy into real improvements in care and treatment. Environmentally Friendly? does not leave out the positive experiences of mental health service users, and these cases are worth noting, given the stretch of most hard-pressed and dedicated staff in meeting a growing need. However, for many mental health service users, the government's rhetoric is a long way from the reality. The report highlights an unacceptable incidence of non-therapeutic environments in psychiatric wards. Service users report feeling unsafe, unheard and unaffected by the plethora of well intended legislation. Mind welcomes the government's emphasis on outcome-focused change, for example, its guidance recently issued to health authorities and trusts on Cleanliness in Hospitals (NHSE, July 2000). But if user services are to improve, mental health staff need to make changes in the way they monitor and report interaction with their clients. Clinical governance development plans, which are meant to reflect improvement, should make a stronger impact in the services. And it is crucial that patients spell out their requirements for quality services. For providers, it is a challenge, but one which is well worth the engagement, because - as many mental health service users will tell you - the stakes are high.",

The entire Poptones catalogue will be distributed in Japan after the company signed a licensing deal with Sony. Mr McGee's stripped-down label harks back to his early days at Creation, the record company he founded in the early 1980s which went on to launch Oasis. Poptones signs its acts onto small contracts in a deliberate attempt to move away from the style of bigger labels, which often sign artists on six-album deals. Mr McGee also aims to capitalise on music sales over the internet, though the bulk of sales will still come from conventional retail channels. Mr McGee said: \"We had tremendous success in Japan with Creation, particularly with Oasis and Primal Scream.

Tax makes up 68.5% of the total price.</p> <p><b>March 1993:</b> The Conservative chancellor, Norman Lamont, announces a 10% increase in road fuel duties. At the same time, he reveals plans to increase these duties by at least 3% above the rate of inflation every year from the next year - a formula that becomes known as the \"fuel duty escalator\". </p> <p><b>November 1993:</b> Chancellor Kenneth Clarke increases the escalator to at least 5% in real terms for each future budget. </p> <p><b>Mid-1994:</b> The price of unleaded petrol passes 50p a litre in the UK. Tax now makes up 76.5% of the price.</p> <p><b>The approaching crisis</b><br></p> <p><b>November 1997:</b> In the first Labour budget for 18 years, Gordon Brown announces an immediate 9.3% rise in petrol duty and states that the escalator would in future be at least 6%. </p> <p><b>Mid-1998:</b> Unleaded petrol now costs around 65p a litre, with tax making up 81.9% of the price. </p> <p><b>March 1999:</b> In an effort to increase crude oil prices, which have remained low for the past three years, Opec cuts oil production. </p> <p><b>November 1999:</b> Mr Brown reveals that the escalator mechanism will be scrapped. This is welcomed by road users and organisations such as the AA and RAC, but infuriates Friends of the Earth and other environmental groups. </p> <p><b>March 2000:</b> In the budget, petrol duties are raised by just under 2p a litre. Rising crude oil prices lead to substantial increases in petrol prices - and government tax revenues. </p> <p><b>August 2000:</b> Petrol protests erupt across France, causing massive disruption. British commentators suggest that similar events \"could never happen here\". UK petrol prices pass 80p a litre, with tax making up around 72% of the total price. An attempt to persuade motorists to \"boycott the pumps\" in protest falls flat.</p> <p><b>The September crisis</b></p> <p><b>Early September:</b> Crude oil prices reach $35 a barrel, pushing petrol prices well beyond 80p. </p> <p><b>September 7:</b> About 100 farmers and truckers block access to the Stanlow oil refinery in Cheshire.</p> <p><b>September 10:</b> Protests spread across the country and further refineries are closed. Despite limited media coverage of the protests, some motorists begin to buy extra supplies of fuel. This leads to queues at petrol stations and the first shortages.</p> <p><b>September 11:</b> Britain now faces widespread shortages of fuel. The government is granted emergency powers by the privy council to regulate fuel supplies, but tanker drivers refuse to leave their depots, citing intimidation by protesters.</p> <p><b>September 12:</b> Tony Blair promises to get fuel supplies moving again within 24 hours but says he will not give in to illegal protests.</p> <p><b>September 13:</b> There is little sign of the prime minister's demands being met. </p> <p><b>September 14:</b> The Daily Mail calls for the blockades to end. Most protesters call off their blockades in the face of the government's defiance of their demands, growing economic disruption and signs that the public mood is turning against them. Protesters set a 60-day deadline for government action.</p> <p><b>The aftermath</b></p> <p><b>September 20:</b> The shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, promises that the Tory party will cut petrol prices by 3p a litre if elected. The social security secretary, Alistair Darling, describes Mr Portillo's announcement as \"opportunistic\" and a \"return to the worst of Tory boom and bust\".</p> <p><b>Late September:</b> The government puts plans in place to cope with any future petrol protests. The home secretary, Jack Straw, takes charge of the government's \"fuel taskforce\". Oil companies agree to reinforce their distribution systems. </p> <p><b>October:</b> The government continues to attack the fuel protesters as dangerous supporters of illegal action. Fears grow that when the 60-day deadline expires protesters will attack the national grid.</p> <p><b>October 29:</b> Ahead of the government's pre-Budget report, Mr Blair says the government will not give in to calls for cuts in petrol taxation.</p> <p><b>November:</b> Shaun Woodward, the Labour MP for Witney who defected from the Conservatives, claims that there are links between the fuel protesters and the far-right British National party. By now the movement's credibility has been badly damaged by the government's campaign against them and polls suggest that public support for renewed action is slipping.</p> <p><b>November 6:</b> Divisions between petrol campaigners grow, with some now calling for only a token demonstration after the end of the 60-day deadline. Hauliers propose a slow-driving convoy from Jarrow to London, but the plan is attacked as tasteless by surviving Jarrow hunger marchers and police say they will dictate the truckers' route. </p> <p><b>November 8:</b> In his pre-Budget report, Gordon Brown offers a \u00a31.5bn package to appease drivers. His plans include a 3p cut in tax on low-sulphur fuel and a \"BritDisc\" system to charge overseas trucks for using British roads. The chancellor says his tax cuts surpass those proposed by the Tories.</p> <p><b>November 9:</b> Divisions among protesters grow. Some welcome the chancellor's concessions, while others begin a go-slow convoy, aiming to reach London on November 13. </p> <p><b>November 10:</b> The convoy fails to impress, with few drivers taking part. The police disrupt its progress.</p> <p><b>November 13:</b> The 60-day deadline expires with minimal attention.</p> <p><b>November 14:</b> Truckers plan to gather in Hyde Park to renew their demand for a 26p cut in fuel tax, but the battle for public opinion seems to have been lost.</p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000\">Special report: pre-Budget report</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/transport\">Special report: transport in Britain</a><br></p> <p><b>Graphic</b><br> http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/petrol/graphic/0,7367,395741,00.html \"&gt;Fuel protest convoy<br></p> <p><b>Interactive quiz</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/quiz/questions/0,5961,368738,00.html\">Quiz: do you know your oil?</a><br></p> <p><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.rha.net/fairplay2000/\" target=\"_new\">Fair play on fuel</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.freighttaxes.com/\" target=\"_new\">Freight Transport Associtation</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.boycott-the-pumps.com/\" target=\"_new\">Boycott the pumps</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.iru.org/IRU_New/Services/Waiting.E.html\" target=\"_new\">International transport union</a><br><a href=\"http://npr.org/news/specials/oil/gasprices.chronology.html \" target=\"_new\">Oil prices over time</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.number10.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">10 Downing Street</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.fuelinfo.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Fuelinfo: government fuel site</a></p>",

March 1999: In an effort to increase crude oil prices, which have remained low for the past three years, Opec cuts oil production. November 1999: Mr Brown reveals that the escalator mechanism will be scrapped. This is welcomed by road users and organisations such as the AA and RAC, but infuriates Friends of the Earth and other environmental groups. March 2000: In the budget, petrol duties are raised by just under 2p a litre. Rising crude oil prices lead to substantial increases in petrol prices - and government tax revenues. August 2000: Petrol protests erupt across France, causing massive disruption. British commentators suggest that similar events \"could never happen here\". UK petrol prices pass 80p a litre, with tax making up around 72% of the total price. An attempt to persuade motorists to \"boycott the pumps\" in protest falls flat. The September crisis Early September: Crude oil prices reach $35 a barrel, pushing petrol prices well beyond 80p. September 7: About 100 farmers and truckers block access to the Stanlow oil refinery in Cheshire. September 10: Protests spread across the country and further refineries are closed. Despite limited media coverage of the protests, some motorists begin to buy extra supplies of fuel. This leads to queues at petrol stations and the first shortages. September 11: Britain now faces widespread shortages of fuel. The government is granted emergency powers by the privy council to regulate fuel supplies, but tanker drivers refuse to leave their depots, citing intimidation by protesters. September 12: Tony Blair promises to get fuel supplies moving again within 24 hours but says he will not give in to illegal protests. September 13: There is little sign of the prime minister's demands being met. September 14: The Daily Mail calls for the blockades to end. Most protesters call off their blockades in the face of the government's defiance of their demands, growing economic disruption and signs that the public mood is turning against them. Protesters set a 60-day deadline for government action. The aftermath September 20: The shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, promises that the Tory party will cut petrol prices by 3p a litre if elected. The social security secretary, Alistair Darling, describes Mr Portillo's announcement as \"opportunistic\" and a \"return to the worst of Tory boom and bust\". Late September: The government puts plans in place to cope with any future petrol protests. The home secretary, Jack Straw, takes charge of the government's \"fuel taskforce\". Oil companies agree to reinforce their distribution systems. October: The government continues to attack the fuel protesters as dangerous supporters of illegal action. Fears grow that when the 60-day deadline expires protesters will attack the national grid. October 29: Ahead of the government's pre-Budget report, Mr Blair says the government will not give in to calls for cuts in petrol taxation. November: Shaun Woodward, the Labour MP for Witney who defected from the Conservatives, claims that there are links between the fuel protesters and the far-right British National party. By now the movement's credibility has been badly damaged by the government's campaign against them and polls suggest that public support for renewed action is slipping. November 6: Divisions between petrol campaigners grow, with some now calling for only a token demonstration after the end of the 60-day deadline. Hauliers propose a slow-driving convoy from Jarrow to London, but the plan is attacked as tasteless by surviving Jarrow hunger marchers and police say they will dictate the truckers' route. November 8: In his pre-Budget report, Gordon Brown offers a \u00a31.5bn package to appease drivers. His plans include a 3p cut in tax on low-sulphur fuel and a \"BritDisc\" system to charge overseas trucks for using British roads. The chancellor says his tax cuts surpass those proposed by the Tories. November 9: Divisions among protesters grow. Some welcome the chancellor's concessions, while others begin a go-slow convoy, aiming to reach London on November 13. November 10: The convoy fails to impress, with few drivers taking part. The police disrupt its progress. November 13: The 60-day deadline expires with minimal attention. November 14: Truckers plan to gather in Hyde Park to renew their demand for a 26p cut in fuel tax, but the battle for public opinion seems to have been lost.

      "bodyText": "Fuel protesters today demanded to meet the prime minister, Tony Blair, as the first of their lorries arrived in London. Around 50 lorries which had assembled at Thurrock Services, Essex, this morning were the first to arrive in the capital. They were stopped by police and parked on the A40 Westway in west London. After some negotiations between police and the protesters' spokesman Andrew Spence, it was agreed that a tractor, a Land Rover, and one articulated lorry would be allowed to proceed to Downing Street. The main body of protesters was assembling prior to setting off on foot to Hyde Park. They are expected to walk to Westminster after a rally and speeches. The tractor making its way to Downing Street was draped with a banner reading \"The Labour government are killing British farmers. More suicides this year than ever before.\" The first vehicle in the convoy was driven by haulier, Andy Courtney, who said he was losing \u00a310,000 worth of business by having 13 of his 14 lorries involved in the process. Mr Courtney arrived driving a Toyota Land Cruiser with a sign saying: \"Taxed Out Of Work\" in the windscreen. Other trucks displayed placards in their windows including \"Blair Out Now\" and \"Blair Stitch Up Project\". Mr Courtney said: \"It's time the government came out and met us, not us come to meet them. They throw money around like confetti everywhere apart from where it is needed and expect us to pick up the bill for it.\" However, a spokesman for Mr Blair said: \"The government has never wanted to pick a fight with anybody. We have acknowledged repeatedly that the price of petrol is high and this causes particular problems, for example, for people in rural communities. \"We have done what we can, but to do more would be to start to jeopardise the extra investment the government is putting into public services, to possibly impact on interest rates and we are not prepared to put in jeopardy the hard-won economic stability.\" The spokesman added ministers had said they were prepared to meet protesters, but there had been no request for a meeting today. The transport minister, Lord Macdonald, at his meeting with members of the government's road haulage forum this afternoon, is expected to spell out some of the benefits outlined by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in his pre-budget report last week. Lord Macdonald is expected to say that this year alone tax changes excise duty on lorries would be worth about \u00a34,000 a truck for 250,000 vehicles. Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, said: \"Public support for the fuel protest has clearly evaporated. Causing traffic chaos in London will only alienate the public further.\" In Edinburgh, a slow-moving convoy of fuel protesters in more than 80 lorries, coaches and private vehicles sounded their horns as they drove into the city centre. Earlier, police in London had relaxed their plans for a total exclusion zone preventing protest lorries driving into the centre of the capital because they now expect fewer vehicles to be taking part. Last night, protesters had claimed the main truck convoy heading to London on the M1 was acting as a decoy, with many more vehicles heading directly to the capital. Gateshead-based haulier Craig Eley said as many as 40 other trucks from north-east England had either already arrived in the capital or were planning to travel down last night or early today. \"There will be more protesters than people think,\" he said. \"The plan has been to get as many people to London as possible without getting arrested. \"It is fair to say that Andrew [Spence, the convoy leader] has been a good decoy.\" He claimed all the extra vehicles, travelling at normal speeds and not in convoy, would be carrying genuine loads for delivery in the capital and could not be stopped by police. Yesterday was the 60-day deadline for tax concessions, set by protesters after they brought Britain to a standstill in September.

      "body": "<p>Jesus Christ, who dropped a bomb on this place?\" came the cry over CB radio, as the People's Fuel Lobby's go-slow convoy pulled into the Hollies truck stop at Cannock in Warwickshire. Velvet curtain tassels pinned to lorry windscreens shook as trucks heaved over potholes deep with mud. Freddie Mercury was singing I Want to Break Free on the local radio. It was dark, it was raining. We were three miles from the nearest pub. Men were jumping through puddles carrying their washbags to the prefab shower then drawing the blinds on their truck and climbing onto makeshift bunks for the night, next to pictures of their kids.</p> <p>All there was for comfort on the second night of their convoy was an enormous truckers' caff serving huge helpings of custardish-like scrambled eggs. Outside the caff sat Gareth, an alternative documentary maker who was following the convoy in a camper van.</p> <p>\"What's wrong Gareth, like?\"</p> <p>\"The plates are so big here I can't get them into the shot.\"</p> <p>This is the story of the \"Big Boys,\" six struggling Geordie hauliers, an unemployed couple living under a green duvet in an F-reg Fiesta, and \"Jimmy the Drain,\" a Carlisle-based drain cleaner with a dog called Millie. These were the people who blockaded the oil refineries in September and brought the country to a halt. After Gordon Brown's pre-Budget statement they felt tax on fuels was still too high and they were driving for four days at 20mph down the country to make a stand.</p> <p>Dubbed \"The Fat Blokes\" by Guardian cartoonist Steve Bell, told by their leader, Welsh farmer Brynle Williams, to piss off and go home three days ago, pulled apart by the press for their dwindling numbers, outnumbered by the police at every turn, called \"pillocks\" over the CB system by a small group of opposing hauliers in Birmingham, they are an unflagging hardcore of protesters, determined to march till the end.</p> <p>Today, 400 miles from their starting point, they will rally in Hyde Park at midday and the original five will go to Downing Street to deliver a message to Tony Blair \"on behalf of all the public, even lawnmowers users\" that fuel taxes are crippling the country.</p> <p>Most of these men are broke. They have put \u00a31,000 into fuel for this journey. They are losing work in businesses that were already suffering. Tony Finlay, 28, and his wife Alison, 34, from the Less Tax of Fuel campaign had driven from Durham in their Fiesta in which they had slept for the duration. They have spent \u00a351 on petrol and are down to their last fiver. \"We're going to keep going until the fuel runs out. Then we'll just have to sit in a lay-by and wait for a week until Friday, the next date we can draw cash out of our account. We are unemployed, don't call us selfish for being here. We've made a huge sacrifice.\"</p> <p>It is cold at night under their duvet, plus they have hardly any money for food. The chill air is giving Alison bladder trouble and she has to keep getting out of the car at 2am to sprint across the truck stop. \"There is nowhere to squat with all these trucks parked here,\" she says. Behind the car there is only a field full of bemused sheep.</p> <p>It all started on Friday morning at Birtley truck stop south of Gateshead with 20 tons of manure and an inflatable alien propped on top and tied to a stake. \"Who's carrying the stink now\", cried a banner on a tractor. But a 6.30am, as the sun rose over the potholed park, a handful of farmers searched in vain for the protesters. Suddenly a 20-ton hay-bale wagon drove into the stop, tooting.</p> <p>\"Aye, aye, it's Norman Nattress and his hay, he was at Stanlow, like.\" One by one the hauliers began to arrive.</p> <p>Paul Stobbart, 32, rolled in on a seven-and-a-half ton truck with a caravan on the back for his wife Lesley and their 12-year-old daughter Samantha. \"It's a 1986 reg caravan. I usually have it in the field with the horses, like. It's got a shower, a toilet and a gas fire, its like a home from home. When you've got a wife and bairn you've got to get a wash, like.\"</p> <p>Two weeks before the convoy left, they were demanding a fee - to cover fuel costs - for the media to get on a lorry for the full ride to London. In the event, no one paid and the People's Fuel Lobby was more than generous about taking passengers. But there wasn't enough room on the 20 wagons for all the documentary makers and cameramen, let alone press. I had walked half a mile up the A1(M) at 6am to join the convoy, carrying a huge backpack and a bag of oranges (the press had a perverse idea they'd all get scurvy), but there were reporters in brand-new fleeces running through puddles, looking for what had been billed as 200 lorries.</p> <p>Albert Storey, aka \"The Wanderer\", who had driven 70 miles from Carlisle in a 38-ton powder tanker, stepped in when he realised there was a lone woman hitchhiking with 20 angry hauliers. \"Are you daft? We're not having that, get on.\"</p> <p>We broke pies together at 25mph all the way to Lymm in Cheshire, past the Angel of the North.

      "bodyText": "Jesus Christ, who dropped a bomb on this place?\" came the cry over CB radio, as the People's Fuel Lobby's go-slow convoy pulled into the Hollies truck stop at Cannock in Warwickshire. Velvet curtain tassels pinned to lorry windscreens shook as trucks heaved over potholes deep with mud. Freddie Mercury was singing I Want to Break Free on the local radio. It was dark, it was raining. We were three miles from the nearest pub. Men were jumping through puddles carrying their washbags to the prefab shower then drawing the blinds on their truck and climbing onto makeshift bunks for the night, next to pictures of their kids. All there was for comfort on the second night of their convoy was an enormous truckers' caff serving huge helpings of custardish-like scrambled eggs. Outside the caff sat Gareth, an alternative documentary maker who was following the convoy in a camper van. \"What's wrong Gareth, like?\" \"The plates are so big here I can't get them into the shot.\" This is the story of the \"Big Boys,\" six struggling Geordie hauliers, an unemployed couple living under a green duvet in an F-reg Fiesta, and \"Jimmy the Drain,\" a Carlisle-based drain cleaner with a dog called Millie. These were the people who blockaded the oil refineries in September and brought the country to a halt. After Gordon Brown's pre-Budget statement they felt tax on fuels was still too high and they were driving for four days at 20mph down the country to make a stand. Dubbed \"The Fat Blokes\" by Guardian cartoonist Steve Bell, told by their leader, Welsh farmer Brynle Williams, to piss off and go home three days ago, pulled apart by the press for their dwindling numbers, outnumbered by the police at every turn, called \"pillocks\" over the CB system by a small group of opposing hauliers in Birmingham, they are an unflagging hardcore of protesters, determined to march till the end. Today, 400 miles from their starting point, they will rally in Hyde Park at midday and the original five will go to Downing Street to deliver a message to Tony Blair \"on behalf of all the public, even lawnmowers users\" that fuel taxes are crippling the country. Most of these men are broke. They have put \u00a31,000 into fuel for this journey. They are losing work in businesses that were already suffering. Tony Finlay, 28, and his wife Alison, 34, from the Less Tax of Fuel campaign had driven from Durham in their Fiesta in which they had slept for the duration. They have spent \u00a351 on petrol and are down to their last fiver. \"We're going to keep going until the fuel runs out. Then we'll just have to sit in a lay-by and wait for a week until Friday, the next date we can draw cash out of our account. We are unemployed, don't call us selfish for being here. We've made a huge sacrifice.\" It is cold at night under their duvet, plus they have hardly any money for food. The chill air is giving Alison bladder trouble and she has to keep getting out of the car at 2am to sprint across the truck stop. \"There is nowhere to squat with all these trucks parked here,\" she says. Behind the car there is only a field full of bemused sheep. It all started on Friday morning at Birtley truck stop south of Gateshead with 20 tons of manure and an inflatable alien propped on top and tied to a stake. \"Who's carrying the stink now\", cried a banner on a tractor. But a 6.30am, as the sun rose over the potholed park, a handful of farmers searched in vain for the protesters. Suddenly a 20-ton hay-bale wagon drove into the stop, tooting. \"Aye, aye, it's Norman Nattress and his hay, he was at Stanlow, like.\" One by one the hauliers began to arrive. Paul Stobbart, 32, rolled in on a seven-and-a-half ton truck with a caravan on the back for his wife Lesley and their 12-year-old daughter Samantha. \"It's a 1986 reg caravan. I usually have it in the field with the horses, like. It's got a shower, a toilet and a gas fire, its like a home from home. When you've got a wife and bairn you've got to get a wash, like.\" Two weeks before the convoy left, they were demanding a fee - to cover fuel costs - for the media to get on a lorry for the full ride to London. In the event, no one paid and the People's Fuel Lobby was more than generous about taking passengers. But there wasn't enough room on the 20 wagons for all the documentary makers and cameramen, let alone press. I had walked half a mile up the A1(M) at 6am to join the convoy, carrying a huge backpack and a bag of oranges (the press had a perverse idea they'd all get scurvy), but there were reporters in brand-new fleeces running through puddles, looking for what had been billed as 200 lorries. Albert Storey, aka \"The Wanderer\", who had driven 70 miles from Carlisle in a 38-ton powder tanker, stepped in when he realised there was a lone woman hitchhiking with 20 angry hauliers. \"Are you daft? We're not having that, get on.\" We broke pies together at 25mph all the way to Lymm in Cheshire, past the Angel of the North. (\"It would be alright with a bit of paint but it doesn't look like an angel.\") The CB radio blared and morale was strong. \"Keep it together boys.\" \"Drop your speed at the back and let this wagon in on your back door, breaker.\" \"I've got Sky News on my front door, breaker.\" \"Oh no, I've not combed my hair.\" The media did not emerge as hate figures until Saturday morning when the press, confused by the numbers of vehicles on the convoy counted 20 vehicles pulling into a truck stop. This was the number also counted from bridges. Hauliers felt this did not do justice to trucks which had \"joined\" in the middle lane of the M6. \"I am very disappointed in you. I've got a 23-ton wagon full of shite waiting for us in London and I'm going to pour it all over your head if you don't report this fairly,\" said Andrew Spence of the People's Fuel Lobby. I had already been thrown off Albert's truck for reporting that some lorries had got lost at the back of the convoy. \"You're making us look like fools,\" he said. John Coxon of the People's Fuel Lobby took a more lenient view, though: \"You might be intensely annoying,\" he said. \"But we can't leave you at the truck stop.\" Farmer Bill Headley in a 40-ton trailer with two tractors on the back gave me a lift to Milton Keynes, even making his farmer passenger get out and hitch a ride in a TV van. By Saturday several mythical figures had emerged as patron saints of the convoy. The first were the \"barristers\" who, protesters vowed, would deal with any hiccups from their offices \"overlooking Hyde Park\". The second was the \"sandwich woman on the dole\".

Pennant said the fact that farmers and hauliers had joined showed all kinds of classes were working together in this convoy. He was with them until the end in his sparkling Land Rover, staying at hotels or driving home at night. Yesterday the truckers said they would travel to London in coaches if the convoy was stopped. \"Oh, I don't think I've ever travelled in a coach before,\" said Pennant over a mug of tea. \"Farmers don't use public transport. They have their own means of getting around.\"",

      "body": "<p>France, in case anyone had forgotten, currently holds the rotating six-month presidency of the European Union. And next month, in Nice, a summit will be held which should, in theory and among other things, agree the major institutional changes needed to enlarge the EU to up to 30 members.</p> <p>So it comes as something of a surprise to realise - as both Britain's foreign and prime ministers produce resoundingly pro-European (or at least, anti-Eurosceptic) speeches today, less than a month after Tony Blair's previous contribution to the European debate in Warsaw - that the last time a senior French figure said anything serious about Europe was back in June.</p> <p>That was when President Jacques Chirac spoke to the Bundestag in Berlin. Seeking to make up ground on Germany, whose Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer had just made an altogether alarming federalist speech, Mr Chirac talked warmly, but confusingly of inner cores and more intensive integration, remaining vague as to the details so as to offend no one.</p> <p>Since then, however, no leading French politician has made a proper pronouncement on Europe and France's place in it. Indeed the prime minister Lionel Jospin has, like the rest of his government, managed to avoid outlining exactly what kind of Europe France would like since he was elected, which is more than three years ago.</p> <p>There is, of course, an important reason why Messrs Blair and Cook should feel obliged to deliver pro-European blasts from time to time, and that is that the majority of the British people - thanks largely to an often outrageously deceitful Eurosceptic press - remains worried about what Europe represents.</p> <p>The corollary of that may, of course, hold true in France. Since opinion polls continue to show that nearly 60% of the French describe themselves as \"enthusiastic\" or \"favourable\" to the European project, while 70% would like even faster integration, it may be that Messrs Jospin and Chirac simply do not need to make any big European speeches.</p> <p>But another possibility is equally, if not more, likely: France's leaders do not make any big European speeches because they do not actually have any big European ideas. And they do not have any big European ideas because they are not actually very pro-European.</p> <p>In fact, the vision of a federal Europe painted by Mr Fischer inspires horror in most French politicians, many of whom are genuinely far closer to the British view of Europe than anyone in the Eurosceptic British press would like to admit. The very word \"federal\" is anathema in France, where power is by tradition centralised and not split between the capital and the regions.</p> <p>And although a majority of French people do favour a more powerful or federal EU (without actually having thought much about what that might imply), important groups from both sides of the political divide - the Communists and radical Republicans on the left, and some Gaullists and Eurosceptic ex-Gaullists on the right - are fiercely opposed to any more power being transferred to Brussels.</p> <p>Not for nothing is France the biggest offender when it comes to observing EU directives. Not for nothing does it refuse to accept some of the important constraints imposed by the single currency (the country's 2001 Budget, for example, is in clear violation of Paris' promise to Brussels to reduce its budget deficit).</p> <p>France's leaders are reluctant to go very much further down the road to integration.

      "bodyText": "France, in case anyone had forgotten, currently holds the rotating six-month presidency of the European Union. And next month, in Nice, a summit will be held which should, in theory and among other things, agree the major institutional changes needed to enlarge the EU to up to 30 members. So it comes as something of a surprise to realise - as both Britain's foreign and prime ministers produce resoundingly pro-European (or at least, anti-Eurosceptic) speeches today, less than a month after Tony Blair's previous contribution to the European debate in Warsaw - that the last time a senior French figure said anything serious about Europe was back in June. That was when President Jacques Chirac spoke to the Bundestag in Berlin. Seeking to make up ground on Germany, whose Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer had just made an altogether alarming federalist speech, Mr Chirac talked warmly, but confusingly of inner cores and more intensive integration, remaining vague as to the details so as to offend no one. Since then, however, no leading French politician has made a proper pronouncement on Europe and France's place in it. Indeed the prime minister Lionel Jospin has, like the rest of his government, managed to avoid outlining exactly what kind of Europe France would like since he was elected, which is more than three years ago. There is, of course, an important reason why Messrs Blair and Cook should feel obliged to deliver pro-European blasts from time to time, and that is that the majority of the British people - thanks largely to an often outrageously deceitful Eurosceptic press - remains worried about what Europe represents. The corollary of that may, of course, hold true in France. Since opinion polls continue to show that nearly 60% of the French describe themselves as \"enthusiastic\" or \"favourable\" to the European project, while 70% would like even faster integration, it may be that Messrs Jospin and Chirac simply do not need to make any big European speeches. But another possibility is equally, if not more, likely: France's leaders do not make any big European speeches because they do not actually have any big European ideas. And they do not have any big European ideas because they are not actually very pro-European. In fact, the vision of a federal Europe painted by Mr Fischer inspires horror in most French politicians, many of whom are genuinely far closer to the British view of Europe than anyone in the Eurosceptic British press would like to admit. The very word \"federal\" is anathema in France, where power is by tradition centralised and not split between the capital and the regions. And although a majority of French people do favour a more powerful or federal EU (without actually having thought much about what that might imply), important groups from both sides of the political divide - the Communists and radical Republicans on the left, and some Gaullists and Eurosceptic ex-Gaullists on the right - are fiercely opposed to any more power being transferred to Brussels. Not for nothing is France the biggest offender when it comes to observing EU directives. Not for nothing does it refuse to accept some of the important constraints imposed by the single currency (the country's 2001 Budget, for example, is in clear violation of Paris' promise to Brussels to reduce its budget deficit). France's leaders are reluctant to go very much further down the road to integration. They would be happy with something that offered just a few more social guarantees than the lowest common denominator, the free-trade bloc they suspect Britain wants, but absolutely not with the United States of Europe that they suspect Germany is after. France's leaders would, in fact, be satisfied (indeed delighted) with something very close to Mr Blair's vision of a Europe based on the almost ad-hoc cooperation of sovereign governments - itself a vision very similar to Charles de Gaulle's famous \"Europe des patries\". But they can't really say so in public, for fear of losing face to Germany. So they say nothing at all.

Carlton cited Monsignor Renard as a precedent, but said it would have not allowed the programme to have been shown in a neighbouring European country first. \"The fact that this happened 14,000 miles away means that viewers will not be missing out,\" a spokesman said. British television series are regularly syndicated to Australia, where Morse is popular. The Royle Family, Cold Feet and The Bill have been recent hits.

      "body": "<p>Britain</p> <p> Britain will be a warmer place in future, with drier summers and more frequent droughts, but with wetter autumns and winters. In other words: more rain and more river flooding. </p> <p>And there is a double jeopardy. The coastal areas are pinched - in danger of fresh water flooding from within, in danger of high tides from without. </p> <p>Higher sea levels as a result of global warming, combined with the fact that southern England is sinking by about 30 centimetres a century, means that tides will become more threatening. One pessimistic estimate puts the average sea level rise around the coast of East Anglia at 80cm in 50 years' time. </p> <p>One of the greatest threats to Britain is a storm surge - a gigantic wave of low pressure sweeping across the Atlantic from Canada and funnelling down the North Sea which raises the ocean by 30cm and sends it crashing into the English east coast. The west coast is vulnerable to similar surges in the Irish Sea. </p> <p>The surge tide of February 1953 killed more than 300 people in eastern England. </p> <p>It was to prevent such disasters happening again that defences such as the Thames barrier were built. </p> <p>Detailed regional studies of climate change impacts across the UK show a patchwork of consequences, some dramatic, some sad, some welcome. </p> <p>In the south-east, average annual temperatures are expected to increase by 1.2 to 3.4C; winter rainfall to go up by 6%-22%, summer rainfall to drop by 8%-22%. </p> <p>Tracts of country like the Surrey Hills, Kent's \"garden of England\" and the Hampshire downs could experience invasion by alien species. Faster coastal erosion will hasten the end for coastal landmarks like Hurst Castle Spit, Selsey Bill and East Head. New crops like grapes, soya, maize, sunflowers and navy beans could spread. Milder weather is good news for species such as the Adonis Blue butterfly, sand lizard and smooth snake; bad for the likes of the mole cricket, marsh gentian and shallow-rooted beech. </p> <p>In the north-west, 95,000 people, and much of the region's industry and tourism, lie in the coastal plain. Hundreds of miles of sea defences protect them, and local authorities reckon existing and planned new works should keep towns like Morecambe and Blackpool safe for 50 years. </p> <p>There is concern over biodiversity and wildlife habitats. Mudflats and saltmarshes used by species like the knot, curlew, oystercatcher, pink-footed goose, godwit and sanderling may disappear; in upland areas like the Cumbrian mountains, the Pennines and the Peak District, Arctic species like the arctic char, a fish, and plants such as Alpine Lady's Mantle will be put under pressure. <strong> James Meek</strong></p> <p><strong> Russia</strong><br> </p> <p>The permafrost - permanently frozen subsoil - which covers 65% of Russia is becoming less permanent.

      "bodyText": "Britain Britain will be a warmer place in future, with drier summers and more frequent droughts, but with wetter autumns and winters. In other words: more rain and more river flooding. And there is a double jeopardy. The coastal areas are pinched - in danger of fresh water flooding from within, in danger of high tides from without. Higher sea levels as a result of global warming, combined with the fact that southern England is sinking by about 30 centimetres a century, means that tides will become more threatening. One pessimistic estimate puts the average sea level rise around the coast of East Anglia at 80cm in 50 years' time. One of the greatest threats to Britain is a storm surge - a gigantic wave of low pressure sweeping across the Atlantic from Canada and funnelling down the North Sea which raises the ocean by 30cm and sends it crashing into the English east coast. The west coast is vulnerable to similar surges in the Irish Sea. The surge tide of February 1953 killed more than 300 people in eastern England. It was to prevent such disasters happening again that defences such as the Thames barrier were built. Detailed regional studies of climate change impacts across the UK show a patchwork of consequences, some dramatic, some sad, some welcome. In the south-east, average annual temperatures are expected to increase by 1.2 to 3.4C; winter rainfall to go up by 6%-22%, summer rainfall to drop by 8%-22%. Tracts of country like the Surrey Hills, Kent's \"garden of England\" and the Hampshire downs could experience invasion by alien species. Faster coastal erosion will hasten the end for coastal landmarks like Hurst Castle Spit, Selsey Bill and East Head. New crops like grapes, soya, maize, sunflowers and navy beans could spread. Milder weather is good news for species such as the Adonis Blue butterfly, sand lizard and smooth snake; bad for the likes of the mole cricket, marsh gentian and shallow-rooted beech. In the north-west, 95,000 people, and much of the region's industry and tourism, lie in the coastal plain. Hundreds of miles of sea defences protect them, and local authorities reckon existing and planned new works should keep towns like Morecambe and Blackpool safe for 50 years. There is concern over biodiversity and wildlife habitats. Mudflats and saltmarshes used by species like the knot, curlew, oystercatcher, pink-footed goose, godwit and sanderling may disappear; in upland areas like the Cumbrian mountains, the Pennines and the Peak District, Arctic species like the arctic char, a fish, and plants such as Alpine Lady's Mantle will be put under pressure. James Meek Russia The permafrost - permanently frozen subsoil - which covers 65% of Russia is becoming less permanent. A gradual melting process has already begun in developed areas of Siberia and scientists have warned that if temperatures continue to rise, the southern permafrost frontier could retreat by around 150 miles over the next 25 years. In places like the diamond-producing town Mirny, in Yakutia, a quarter of the population have been evacuated because their homes, built on permafrost foundations, have begun to slide into the melting soil. Services along the newer Trans-Siberian railway track have been suspended for days, as parts of the track twist and sink. Roads and bridges have buckled, while oil and gas pipelines have been damaged by the gradual shifting movement. Villagers in the northern extremities of Russia, who have traditionally stored their food in pits cut into the permafrost, have returned to find their stocks destroyed. Were the upper section of permafrost to melt, scientists believe 12 times the level of CO2 normally in the atmosphere would be released, and 2,500 times the normal level of methane, worsening the greenhouse effect.

John Gittings US The movie horror-fantasy of the sea engulfing east coast cities could become reality this century if nothing is done to halt global warming, scientists believe. Take, as they project, temperatures increasing by between 1.5C and 6C (2.7F and 11F), causing the sea to expand and rise by as much as 60cm (2ft); add stronger storms and greater precipitation causing more extreme downpours and cities such as New York and Boston might be in jeopardy. Phenomena already attributed to global warming include: 196,000 hectares (485,000 acres) in Florida burned and 300 homes and other structures destroyed by fires two years ago, and an ice storm that killed 44 in New England the same year.

      "body": "<p>He may have taken a drubbing from the US justice department, but the champ came out jabbing. Unlike Lennox Lewis, who strutted his stuff the night before, Bill Gates lasted 90 minutes without getting booed. </p> <p>More than 10,000 people turned up to see Microsoft's chief software architect give his traditional opening keynote speech at the Comdex computer trade show on Sunday. Previously the event was held in a hotel conference centre, leading to long queues and a scramble for tickets. This time it was in the huge MGM Garden Arena, where acts such as Bruce Springsteen and Carlos Santana are more customary fare. </p> <p>Like them, Mr Gates gave his fans what they came for: glimpses of products that will not appear for a couple of years. </p> <p>The most interesting was \"the tablet\": a slim, flat-screen PC that not only recognises handwriting but also lets users insert words and move phrases around in the same way that text is handled by a word processor. This includes the facility to change upright handwriting into slanted italic and the use of \"shape recognition technology\" to clean up drawings. </p> <p>The tablet was running the next version of Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating system, codenamed Whistler after the Canadian ski resort. </p> <p>Mr Gates' string of helpers included Dave Lauren, son of Ralph Lauren, plugging Polo.com, the fashionwear company's new website. Mr Lauren introduced the idea of \"merchantainment\", which he ominously defined as \"a combination of merchandising and entertainment\". </p> <p>As well as flogging future products, Mr Gates' speech had a message. \"The browser approach that has dominated the past five years was great, but it's really starting to show its age,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "He may have taken a drubbing from the US justice department, but the champ came out jabbing. Unlike Lennox Lewis, who strutted his stuff the night before, Bill Gates lasted 90 minutes without getting booed. More than 10,000 people turned up to see Microsoft's chief software architect give his traditional opening keynote speech at the Comdex computer trade show on Sunday. Previously the event was held in a hotel conference centre, leading to long queues and a scramble for tickets. This time it was in the huge MGM Garden Arena, where acts such as Bruce Springsteen and Carlos Santana are more customary fare. Like them, Mr Gates gave his fans what they came for: glimpses of products that will not appear for a couple of years. The most interesting was \"the tablet\": a slim, flat-screen PC that not only recognises handwriting but also lets users insert words and move phrases around in the same way that text is handled by a word processor. This includes the facility to change upright handwriting into slanted italic and the use of \"shape recognition technology\" to clean up drawings. The tablet was running the next version of Microsoft's Windows 2000 operating system, codenamed Whistler after the Canadian ski resort. Mr Gates' string of helpers included Dave Lauren, son of Ralph Lauren, plugging Polo.com, the fashionwear company's new website. Mr Lauren introduced the idea of \"merchantainment\", which he ominously defined as \"a combination of merchandising and entertainment\". As well as flogging future products, Mr Gates' speech had a message. \"The browser approach that has dominated the past five years was great, but it's really starting to show its age,\" he said. It was time to move on to a system based on powerful software rather than dumb software and powerful hardware. This was a jibe at Sun Microsystems, a Silicon Valley company that sells large servers and recommends basing all software on web browsers which can run independently of Microsoft operating systems. Mr Gates pulled no punches, saying this was a \"big iron view\" of computing, based on a \"stupid client model\". The future required a more balanced approach typified, unsurprisingly, by Microsoft's \".Net\" strategy. However, Mr Gates was careful not to appear too devoted to the PC. He showed Microsoft's smart phone, codenamed Stinger, which has \"the full power of the Pocket PC built in\", and referred to Microsoft's huge investments in WebTV and television set-top boxes, and in the Xbox games console, due next year. He did not complain about Microsoft's share price, which has taken a beating in the past year, wiping about $40bn off his paper fortune.

Since the group urged its supporters to join the RSPCA, 600 applications for membership have been suspended.</p> <p>At the hearing, which begins today, Mr Meade will contest the society's efforts to adopt sweeping powers to decide membership.</p> <p>Among nine categories specified by the RSPCA as a bar to joining the society, an individual membership can be turned down if the application is from the same family or address, or even same area, as that of a CAWG supporter.</p> <p>Senior figures in the society have privately accused CAWG of attempting a coup, but Mr Meade, who won show jumping gold medals at the 1968 Mexico and 1972 Munich Olympics, denies the allegation and maintains that CAWG was formed by those in rural areas who believe the RSPCA had \"lost its way\".</p> <p>The former chairman of the International Equestrian Federation, who faces expulsion from the RSPCA if the society wins the case, accused the society of acting like a cult, requiring members and would-be members to sign up for every existing policy. He denied entryism and said CAWG had no membership list; it instead relied on its supporters to reveal whether or not they were in the RSPCA.</p> <p>\"The society appears to be intolerant, almost afraid of having a debate. I would have thought that it is basically wrong to exclude people who are genuinely interested in animal welfare.

      "bodyText": "Hunt supporters, led by the Olympic equestrian medallist Richard Meade, will this week challenge plans to refuse them membership of the RSPCA, the world's most venerable animal welfare charity. The high court is to rule on who can join the society in the latest battle over the RSPCA's 24-year policy of opposing hunting with dogs. The society recently claimed it was a victim of entryism by Mr Meade's Countryside Animal Welfare Group. Since the group urged its supporters to join the RSPCA, 600 applications for membership have been suspended. At the hearing, which begins today, Mr Meade will contest the society's efforts to adopt sweeping powers to decide membership. Among nine categories specified by the RSPCA as a bar to joining the society, an individual membership can be turned down if the application is from the same family or address, or even same area, as that of a CAWG supporter. Senior figures in the society have privately accused CAWG of attempting a coup, but Mr Meade, who won show jumping gold medals at the 1968 Mexico and 1972 Munich Olympics, denies the allegation and maintains that CAWG was formed by those in rural areas who believe the RSPCA had \"lost its way\". The former chairman of the International Equestrian Federation, who faces expulsion from the RSPCA if the society wins the case, accused the society of acting like a cult, requiring members and would-be members to sign up for every existing policy. He denied entryism and said CAWG had no membership list; it instead relied on its supporters to reveal whether or not they were in the RSPCA. \"The society appears to be intolerant, almost afraid of having a debate. I would have thought that it is basically wrong to exclude people who are genuinely interested in animal welfare. If people behave sensibly, are responsible and caring, then I think it is an extraordinary thing to exclude them from membership,\" said Mr Meade. Farmers, anglers and others are under-represented in the RSPCA, argues CAWG, which wants to alter the society's opposition to the sale of livestock at markets and its concerns over the \"infliction of pain and suffering on fish\" as well as its campaign for a ban on hunting with dogs. The RSPCA is governed by a 1932 act of parliament and has 750,000 registered supporters, but its policies are determined by 55,000 members who pay \u00a317.50 a year (\u00a325 for couples) for the right to vote at the annual meeting. The charity has been the focus of an organised campaign in the past. Fifteen years ago anti-vivisectionists tried to persuade it to take a tougher line against animal tests in laboratories. The decision to put 600 membership applications on hold, CAWG claims, has already thrown up a series of anomalies, including the acceptance of a woman with an urban address in Swindon when her sister with a more rural address in Cirencester was refused. The RSPCA says it will admit individuals who support hunting but not those from organised groups. \"We are seeking to deal in a general way with membership drives that might be damaging to the society - that is campaigns by groups to encourage their members to join the society in order to further their own aims rather than the society's aims,\" said an RSPCA spokeswoman. David Jagger, a Shrewsbury vet who also hunts, had his application blocked despite being occasionally employed by the RSPCA, most recently to treat an injured cat. \"On the one hand I am suitable to work for the RSPCA and on the other hand I am deemed not suitable for membership of the RSPCA,\" said Mr Jagger. \"I support a lot of the society's aims and feel they have been unfair to me.\"",

She couldn't turn on a tap, she couldn't reach things in the kitchen.\" Around 150 children have undergone the surgery, although Emma is the tallest person he has operated on. \"Each case is taken on its individual merits,\" he said. \"Somebody else who is 4ft 9in may be fine, but Emma was not fine about being that height.\" The operation would have cost around \u00a34,000, with each day in hospital costing around \u00a3180, without complications. Both Emma's femurs were broken in the six-hour operation and pins used to attach the bones to a metal frame. This was screwed increasingly tightly to stretch her legs, which grew about 1mm a day. But Emma's left leg broke within two hours of her discharge. She is now in hospital with her third fracture. Her mother, Irene, said: \"We would have tried to do the operation privately if the NHS had not been able to do it.\"",

According to a Sunday Times front-page report (\"Dando murder squad interviews PM's spin doctor\") inadvertently I caused Alastair Campbell to be pulled by the Bill.</p> <p>No one will wish to dredge up the grievous confusion whereby it came to be written (note the sudden Biblical tone; where did that come from?) that Ali had claimed over lunch to have once been Miss Dando's lover. No such claim was made, either seriously or in jest, as he assured us, and in fiasco terms, this is well up there with Cherie's car pass and the separation of Gordon and Sarah. However (and this doesn't do much for public confidence) the only people unaware of my absolute unreliability appear to be the police - and a detective who saw the item interviewed Alastair before eliminating him from inquiries. I hope no one is amused at the thought of my old friend's face while being questioned because of a cock-up here. I know I don't. In fact I'm very, very sorry about it. Now then, let that be an end to the whole sorry business.</p> <p>\u0095What a marvellous Saturday for Bernard Manning. By the time Channel 4 broadcast its favourable Heroes of Comedy documentary about him, Bernard had already enjoyed a triumph on the football field. Radcliffe Borough, the non-league club run by his son Young Bernard of which he is life president, beat Unibond First Division rivals Burscough 2-1 to qualify for the first round - \"first round proper\" to use the correct cliche - of the FA Cup. Next Sunday, Bernard will lead them out at Bury's Gig Lane ground, which is being borrowed for the home tie with York City. You'd have thought York had suffered enough, wouldn't you? It'll be boils next. Then locusts.</p> <p>\u0095Last Wednesday, reports the Washington Post, poll worker Gene Tracy, 79, walked into an election HQ in Florida to explain how an entire bag of ballot papers had been left in his car. \"I about had a cotton-pickin' stroke,\" he told a local reporter. \"I hollered for my wife and I said, 'The dadburn ballots are still in the car'.\" Dadburn ballots indeed. Who now will dare accuse the USA of putting its democracy in the hands of rogues, incompetents, fools, and the cast of the Beverly Hillbillies?</p> <p>\u0095Did anyone else hear the New Labour MP for Ealing Stephen Pound on Bryan Hayes's show on Radio 5 Live on Friday night? Blimey, chief, don't say nuffink, nor nuffink, nor not; but straight up, he sounded like the man who answers the phone dahn Boris the Jackal Johnson's manor. That or the character Cockney Wanker out of Viz. Speaking of the dome, for example, Mr Pound referred to a visit there with his wife thus: \"I took the Guv'nor to see it, and she was well choked.\" God spare us from Mockney MPs who think they're comedians. Steve, son, two words in yer shell-like: shut it.</p> <p>\u0095Last week's item about a Reader's Digest executive being approached by a tart provokes Alastair Stirling to write from Glasgow to recall \"a gag so old it needs carbon dating\" about a Church of Scotland minister who was tired after a long train journey \"and made his way up from Central Station and over Blythswood Square. From the shadows a voice was heard: 'Hello there darlin', d'ye fancy super sex?' To which the minister replied: 'Just the soup thanks. I'm absolutely starving'.\"</p> <p>\u0095We began with inquiring police, and so must we end. In the Austrian town of Graz, detectives seek a fake nurse inevitably known as the \"Angel of Mercy\" for her habit of sneaking into hospital wards late at night and having sex with male patients who are seriously ill, preferably in a coma. Eleven incidents in five hospitals have been noted this year. \"She believes she's doing the patients a favour,\" says Bernard Kaiser of the Graz police. \"But it's disrespectful.\"</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",

No one will wish to dredge up the grievous confusion whereby it came to be written (note the sudden Biblical tone; where did that come from?) that Ali had claimed over lunch to have once been Miss Dando's lover. No such claim was made, either seriously or in jest, as he assured us, and in fiasco terms, this is well up there with Cherie's car pass and the separation of Gordon and Sarah. However (and this doesn't do much for public confidence) the only people unaware of my absolute unreliability appear to be the police - and a detective who saw the item interviewed Alastair before eliminating him from inquiries. I hope no one is amused at the thought of my old friend's face while being questioned because of a cock-up here. I know I don't. In fact I'm very, very sorry about it. Now then, let that be an end to the whole sorry business. \u0095What a marvellous Saturday for Bernard Manning. By the time Channel 4 broadcast its favourable Heroes of Comedy documentary about him, Bernard had already enjoyed a triumph on the football field. Radcliffe Borough, the non-league club run by his son Young Bernard of which he is life president, beat Unibond First Division rivals Burscough 2-1 to qualify for the first round - \"first round proper\" to use the correct cliche - of the FA Cup. Next Sunday, Bernard will lead them out at Bury's Gig Lane ground, which is being borrowed for the home tie with York City. You'd have thought York had suffered enough, wouldn't you? It'll be boils next. Then locusts. \u0095Last Wednesday, reports the Washington Post, poll worker Gene Tracy, 79, walked into an election HQ in Florida to explain how an entire bag of ballot papers had been left in his car. \"I about had a cotton-pickin' stroke,\" he told a local reporter. \"I hollered for my wife and I said, 'The dadburn ballots are still in the car'.\" Dadburn ballots indeed. Who now will dare accuse the USA of putting its democracy in the hands of rogues, incompetents, fools, and the cast of the Beverly Hillbillies? \u0095Did anyone else hear the New Labour MP for Ealing Stephen Pound on Bryan Hayes's show on Radio 5 Live on Friday night? Blimey, chief, don't say nuffink, nor nuffink, nor not; but straight up, he sounded like the man who answers the phone dahn Boris the Jackal Johnson's manor. That or the character Cockney Wanker out of Viz. Speaking of the dome, for example, Mr Pound referred to a visit there with his wife thus: \"I took the Guv'nor to see it, and she was well choked.\" God spare us from Mockney MPs who think they're comedians. Steve, son, two words in yer shell-like: shut it. \u0095Last week's item about a Reader's Digest executive being approached by a tart provokes Alastair Stirling to write from Glasgow to recall \"a gag so old it needs carbon dating\" about a Church of Scotland minister who was tired after a long train journey \"and made his way up from Central Station and over Blythswood Square. From the shadows a voice was heard: 'Hello there darlin', d'ye fancy super sex?' To which the minister replied: 'Just the soup thanks. I'm absolutely starving'.\" \u0095We began with inquiring police, and so must we end. In the Austrian town of Graz, detectives seek a fake nurse inevitably known as the \"Angel of Mercy\" for her habit of sneaking into hospital wards late at night and having sex with male patients who are seriously ill, preferably in a coma. Eleven incidents in five hospitals have been noted this year. \"She believes she's doing the patients a favour,\" says Bernard Kaiser of the Graz police. \"But it's disrespectful.\" diary@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>My local council, Hackney, is bust. Why? Huge articles in the Guardian and Observer concentrated on the incompetence of councillors and officials. The Guardian traced the Hackney horror back to 1982 when \"the hard left took over\".</p> <p>Well, the hard left, if it ever existed, vanished without trace from Hackney council years ago. So did the entire left. The council is now run by a Labour rump in coalition with a Tory rump helped out by Liberal Democrats who are always eager to take part in anything PC. PC used to stand for \"politically correct\" but now it stands for the two remedies to which all three major parties aspire: privatisation and cuts.</p> <p>How has a once vibrant local Labour party been so humiliated? The answer goes much deeper than incompetence. It goes back to Thatcher's assault on local democracy. Her government abolished the large councils which raised some of their rates from the rich to help the poor (GLC, Ilea and the metropolitan boroughs), and stifled the rest by capping their ability to raise rates. This put a stop to the process of municipal reform that sustained so many Labour councillors when they were elected (including rightwing Labour politicians like Herbert Morrison, the first Labour mayor of Hackney).</p> <p>In reply to Thatcher, there was none of the defiance shown by another Labour mayor, George Lansbury, at Poplar in 1921. He went to prison rather than implement government policies against the poor. \"The workers must be given tangible proof that Labour administration means something different from capitalist administration,\" he said.</p> <p>No such proof was available to local electors during Thatcher's attack on them. So the problem became not the power of local councils but their impotence. If you can't do anything about poverty in your area, why bother being a councillor at all? In areas like Hackney, pretty well everyone with any reformist inclination has dropped out of the council, leaving the spineless residue with nothing but PC - privatisation and cuts.</p> <p>The government meanwhile treats elected local councils as springboards for their vacuous public relations offensives. I cite a press release issued by Hackney Council on March 18 1998 entitled \"Top government official helps launch Hackney's anti-poverty strategy\". The \"top government official\" was Guy Gardiner from the cabinet office's social exclusion unit who visited Hackney the following day for the launch of the council's \"ground-breaking anti-poverty strategy\". The ground was broken with Hackney's two MPs over appropriately proletarian fish and chips in a local pensioners' club. The strategy, said the press release, \"is closely linked to Prime Minister Tony Blair's work on social exclusion\". A foreword to the strategy was written by Professor Peter Townsend, the veteran anti-poverty campaigner. The strategy, wrote Townsend, needed \"decently paid jobs and more of them in local public services\".</p> <p>What happened to that strategy? It vanished as fast as the fish and chips. A cabinet office spokeswoman told me nothing more was said on the matter. Guy Gardiner, who turns out to be an assistant chief constable in Kent, was an \"external adviser\" to the cabinet office.

      "bodyText": "My local council, Hackney, is bust. Why? Huge articles in the Guardian and Observer concentrated on the incompetence of councillors and officials. The Guardian traced the Hackney horror back to 1982 when \"the hard left took over\". Well, the hard left, if it ever existed, vanished without trace from Hackney council years ago. So did the entire left. The council is now run by a Labour rump in coalition with a Tory rump helped out by Liberal Democrats who are always eager to take part in anything PC. PC used to stand for \"politically correct\" but now it stands for the two remedies to which all three major parties aspire: privatisation and cuts. How has a once vibrant local Labour party been so humiliated? The answer goes much deeper than incompetence. It goes back to Thatcher's assault on local democracy. Her government abolished the large councils which raised some of their rates from the rich to help the poor (GLC, Ilea and the metropolitan boroughs), and stifled the rest by capping their ability to raise rates. This put a stop to the process of municipal reform that sustained so many Labour councillors when they were elected (including rightwing Labour politicians like Herbert Morrison, the first Labour mayor of Hackney). In reply to Thatcher, there was none of the defiance shown by another Labour mayor, George Lansbury, at Poplar in 1921. He went to prison rather than implement government policies against the poor. \"The workers must be given tangible proof that Labour administration means something different from capitalist administration,\" he said. No such proof was available to local electors during Thatcher's attack on them. So the problem became not the power of local councils but their impotence. If you can't do anything about poverty in your area, why bother being a councillor at all? In areas like Hackney, pretty well everyone with any reformist inclination has dropped out of the council, leaving the spineless residue with nothing but PC - privatisation and cuts. The government meanwhile treats elected local councils as springboards for their vacuous public relations offensives. I cite a press release issued by Hackney Council on March 18 1998 entitled \"Top government official helps launch Hackney's anti-poverty strategy\". The \"top government official\" was Guy Gardiner from the cabinet office's social exclusion unit who visited Hackney the following day for the launch of the council's \"ground-breaking anti-poverty strategy\". The ground was broken with Hackney's two MPs over appropriately proletarian fish and chips in a local pensioners' club. The strategy, said the press release, \"is closely linked to Prime Minister Tony Blair's work on social exclusion\". A foreword to the strategy was written by Professor Peter Townsend, the veteran anti-poverty campaigner. The strategy, wrote Townsend, needed \"decently paid jobs and more of them in local public services\". What happened to that strategy? It vanished as fast as the fish and chips. A cabinet office spokeswoman told me nothing more was said on the matter. Guy Gardiner, who turns out to be an assistant chief constable in Kent, was an \"external adviser\" to the cabinet office. And now, as Hackney disappears under mountains of rubbish bags, the strategy of providing more jobs in the public services has been replaced by, well, you've guessed it, privatisation and cuts (and the sacking of hundreds of public service workers). Blair's great campaign against social exclusion turns out to be devoted in Hackney to social exclusion on an unimaginable scale. \u0095However clever we journalists think we are, we can only publish new stories when we find them out, and we can only find them out when somebody tells us. The journalist's hero or heroine runs great risks to provide proof of secrecy and skulduggery in high places. Such a hero is Mordechai Vanunu, who went to the Sunday Times in 1986 with proof of one of the most important stories since the war: the fact that Israel was making nuclear weapons. The Sunday Times made full use of this fantastic scoop, but did not properly protect its source. Mordechai was seduced by an agent from Israeli intelligence, kidnapped, drugged and carried off to Israel where he was jailed for 18 years.

Until young people received encouragement from their parents to start a business - as they did in America - levels of entrepreneurship in the laggards would remain weak.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Budding entrepreneurs would be better off leaving Britain and seeking their fortunes in the sunnier climes of Brazil, according to a survey of top executives. The second annual Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, which measures the number of adults involved in new firms, places Britain 12th in a league table of 21 countries. The monitor, published by London Business School and Babson College in the United States, ranks Britain behind Australia, India and Brazil. If true, it would appear that Gordon Brown's vision of transforming the UK into a haven for entrepreneurs is a long way from being fulfilled. The survey found that only one in 33 adults is trying to start a business, compared to one in 8 in Brazil, one in 10 in the United States and one in 12 in Australia. Languishing at the bottom of the league table are Japan and Ireland, where fewer than one in a 100 people is trying to start a business. The survey, which is based on a sample of 43,000 individuals and nearly 800 experts around the globe, claims that there is a strong link between entrepreneurial activity and economic growth, although the authors admit that there are a number of anomalies. For example, both Ireland and Singapore, which consistently post strong growth rates, have low levels of entrepreneurship. Professor Paul Reynolds of London Business School and Babson College, said this was because both countries relied heavily for growth on external trade rather than indigenous entrepreneurial activity. However, he admitted that France, which shows the same pattern of high growth and a low rate of entrepreneurship, was harder to explain. Prof Reynolds said levels of entrepreneurship were influenced by a wide range of factors, including the age structure of the population, the availability of finances for start-ups, the perception of opportunity and the number of people going into higher education. He said the main ingredient was cultural. Until young people received encouragement from their parents to start a business - as they did in America - levels of entrepreneurship in the laggards would remain weak.",

The agreement with the European semiconductor manufacturer gives TTPCom more platforms from which to sell its software and designs to handset manufacturers. TTPCom floated last month, raising \u00a340m to fund overseas expansion and to recruit staff. It designs mobile phone chips and software which it licenses out to manufacturers. The products are aimed at the digital cellular market and are expected to be used in the next generation of mobile phones. The company said the growth of palmtop and handheld devices with telephony built in was key to TTPCom's future.

      "bodyText": "Bidders spurn airwave auction The auction for licences to beam high-speed wireless internet services appeared headed for a flop yesterday as a second bidder withdrew and the others snubbed more than half the regions on offer. FirstMark Communications, a private US company, pulled out during round five on day two, following Unica Communications, which quit on Friday before the bidding started. The auction had raised less than \u00a336.5m by the end of round six, compared to analysts' initial estimates of \u00a31bn or more for the final tally. Eight companies remain in the running for 42 licences. However, eight of the 14 regions have failed to attract bids, with the action centring on London and other big cities. Energis leads the bidding with \u00a34.5m for one of three London licences. World Online under scrutiny The Rotterdam headquarters of internet service provider World Online has been raided following allegations of insider trading during the company's disastrous initial public offering in March. The company said it was cooperating with Dutch justice department investigators. Schroders' new arm for the rich Schroders, the financial services group, has introduced a Europe-wide private banking business targeting clients with more than \u00a3250,000 in spare cash. It claims to stand out from those promoted by other financial institutions for the \"mass affluent\", with \u00a350,000 to invest. Holding firms in Lazards merge Eurafrance and Azeo, which hold 4% and 13% respectively in Paris-based Lazards, plan to merge by the end of the first quarter of 2001. The two companies are under pressure from investors to improve returns. Michel David-Weill, chairman of Lazards and of Eurafrance, was quoted in the French media as saying the bank was not for sale. Yet it has been linked with Deutsche Bank and Italian group Mediobank. VW withdraws from show Volkswagen has pulled out of next year's London motor show, saying it prefers to concentrate on the Birmingham biennial motor show in 2002. A recent survey of car manufacturers found they preferred to exhibit in the larger and more prestigious Birmingham show.

I filed it in the wrong place in my mind, among the wrong artists, mistaking him for a kind of neo-Pop signmaker, an artist whom one could lodge somewhere between American painter Peter Halley and British artist Julian Opie. I liked a set of geometric, semi-abstract motifs cut in stone that Mullican placed around the edge of a pond in Middleheim Sculpture Park in Antwerp, and whenever I thought about Mullican's work I would find myself beside that little lake in my imagination, as though barely discerning something that lay beneath the surface. </p> <p>My fuzzy misappraisal of Mullican, even my inability to focus on what he did, is itself an illustration of the preoccupations of his art. His work is about how we log the world, how we perceive signs and symbols and pictures, and how we flesh them out into full-blown mental images. His work is also about the imaginary mental maps we make, the lists, the baggage, the black holes in our consciousness, and the cosmologies we keep in our heads. Further - there's always a further in Mullican's art - his is an art that triggers thoughts that leap from one thing to another. His work is encyclopedic, leaky, paradoxical and complicated. Mullican has made drawings, photographs, sculptures, objects, performances, texts, appropriations, rubbings, installations, banners. He has made drawn, painted, printed, carved and cast signs; computer-generated models; virtual-reality pieces. It is exhausting to list. I don't claim to understand the half of it, but seeing his work en masse is as absorbing as it is often incomprehensible. </p> <p>Mullican's solo show at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford is just one half of a travelling exhibition of his work. Another swathe of it is also currently at the Tapies Foundation in Barcelona. Imagining the unseen half of the show is part of the game. The exhibition, after all, is subtitled More Details From an Imaginary Universe. I get caught up in details - his stained glass pieces, beautiful abstract windows leaning against a wall; the fact that all Mullican's work is colour-coded, but that I can't remember which colours denote inner experience, the hard-assed world of facts and the things we've heard about but haven't quite grasped for ourselves. </p> <p>I laugh at his lexicon of hand-drawn symbols - a nose, an eye, the devil and the fires of hell and a toothpaste tube. Among his collection of photographs, pinned-up scrapbook- style on the wall, Mullican often uses a photographic portrait of a dead man, and invariably places it next to a picture of a painted wooden mannequin of a young boy. These images make us think about how the smiling wooden face is more life-like than the deathly portrait of someone who once truly was alive. \"I slept like a log,\" the saying goes. Mullican's Sleeping Child is a timber off-cut, one end resting on a pillow on the floor. A child might turn anything into a doll, and we are invited to view the piece of wood in just such a light. The lump of sawn wood, the soft white pillow. </p> <p>Inevitably, I also think (as has Mullican) of certain kinds of reductive sculpture from the 1960s and 1970s, and how Mullican has turned the simplest thing into a symbol, and how complex such symbols can be. He has remade this work several times over the years, and it is more than a one-line gag. Like the double portrait, it tells us something about affective, and how impossible it is to live like Mr Gradgrind, in a world of mere utility and facts. I guess Sleeping Child is a kind of Ur-sculpture, a comment on creativity. But, however much it is a symbol, it is a thing. It has presence. Its components are familiar, yet it disturbs. It hangs around in my head and won't go away. </p> <p> I look at Mullican's bold pictographic signs and read the artist's name, and the words God, Before Birth, Death, Heaven and Hell, and realise that these concepts have become off-limits for most artists, even though they have been the major preoccupations of art for thousands of years. Mullican watches the world - and life - go by. He knows detachment is impossible, and that in the midst of things any world-view is liable to be scrambled, incomplete. </p> <p>The stick man, that universal pictogram, is a major presence in Mullican's work. His stick man's name is Glen. Glen falls asleep on the floor, he squats against the wall and thinks about the time he hurt himself skiing. He holds his hands to his ears because, a caption tells us, the sound from next door is driving him crazy. We flesh Glen out for ourselves, and imagine his maunderings and his worries. We fill the empty white space around him in our minds, imagining his complications. We do the same thing when we read a novel or watch a movie. Filling in the details, and knowing that the world we invent is a dubious, faulty place, is just one of the lessons of Mullican's work. </p> <p>Glen's world is just a fragment among fragments in this cluttered, strange exhibition. There are bulletin boards, reams of pictograms, big painted signs and videos of the artist, hypnotised, performing and acting out various activities. Mullican hypnotised - acting as a five-year-old, and as a 55-year-old, is painful to watch. He is both there and not there, self-aware but somehow not there. He speaks of the experience as one of acute clarity, but fuzzy at the edges. He says it is like having jet lag, though I reckon many of us go around in such a state most of the time. </p> <p>At Oxford, there are things that make you laugh and confuse you. There were also one or two moments when Mullican almost had me in tears. On one of his casually arranged bulletin boards is a text from a performance, to be read aloud by the artist. It recounts incidents from the fictional life of a woman, from her birth to her death. It includes rites of passage, such as, \"Learning to use her hands... experiencing puberty... her husband dies\", alongside stray but poignant details: \"Learning about gravity in school... tasting that there's too much salt in the salad... thinking of her husband's childhood... the backyard flooded during a heavy rain.\" </p> <p>Time goes by and the incidents pile up.

Reading, we flip between her inner thoughts and feelings and objective fact, places, experiences and things. It is a life of accumulated details; then it ends. The text is poignant and terribly restrained. You feel a whole life hidden behind a dam of facts, a personality in suspension. Focus on the little things in Mullican's work, and it is great.

Penry, whose IQ has been tested at 56, spends his days colouring with crayons and looking at comics he cannot read, his lawyers say.Now, after 20 years on death row, he is due to be executed this Thursday by lethal injection.</p> <p>Penry, 44, seems uncertain about just what that means. \"The only thing what I know is that they will have a needle in my arm, just like an IV, that's going to put me to sleep,\" he said in a recent hour-long interview from behind a window on death row in Livingston, Texas. \"I think it's a cruel thing to do, to put me to sleep.\"</p> <p>He is to die for the 1979 rape and murder of Pamela Mosley Carpenter, 22, the daughter of a prominent local family, who was decorating her new home when he forced his way in. Penry was on parole after serving two years for an earlier rape.</p> <p><b> Tormented childhood</b><br></p> <p>Penry, who rode to the crime scene on his bicycle, was the son of an absent father who taunted him as retarded and a mother who tormented him because she considered him illegitimate, relatives said. According to family members and neighbours, when he was a child, his mother burned him in a scalding bath, locked him in his room without food or water and forced him to eat his own faeces and drink his own urine.</p> <p>The case has attracted widespread attention. In 1989 it was the subject of a landmark ruling by the US supreme court which said it was not cruel and unusual punishment to execute those with learning disabilities. But a sharply divided court said that a jury had to consider evidence of such disabilities when deciding whether to impose the death sentence, and it ordered a new trial for Penry.</p> <p>At his second trial, Penry was again sentenced to death.</p> <p>Now, although his lawyers have appealed to the supreme court, arguing that the judge's instructions to the jury at the second trial were defective, the real battle is for the hearts of the 18 people on the Texas board of pardons and paroles, which has granted clemency in a capital case only once in the last five years. A wide range of individuals and organisations have asked the board to spare Penry's life.</p> <p>Describing it as an \"urgent humanitarian appeal\", the European Union wrote that executions of people with learning disabilities \"degrade the dignity and worth of the human person\". The American Bar Association, which has no policy on the death penalty in general, wrote that such executions were \"unacceptable in a civilised world\".</p> <p>In their arguments to the board, the state and Penry's lawyers reflect opposing attitudes to the death penalty. Almost half of the state's brief is devoted to graphic details of the crime, and it concludes by saying Penry should be executed \"for the sake of Pamela Carpenter\".</p> <p>In contrast, Penry's lawyers barely mention the crime or the victim, and they ask for mercy for the defendant. The victim's family \"has suffered an unspeakable loss and the hearts of everyone on the defence team go out to them\", his lawyer, Robert Smith - whose New York law firm is representing Penry without a fee - wrote in his brief to the pardons board.</p> <p>\"The question before you now, however, is the appropriate punishment for Penry,\" Mr Smith said. \"There is no societal retribution in killing a person with the mind of a six-year-old.\"</p> <p>Of the 38 states which have capital punishment, 13 bar the execution of people with learning disabilities, as does federal law. The classification covers people with an IQ of below 70 who are unable to adapt to daily life. Those who oppose the execution of people with such disabilities say they lack the moral culpability to justify their receiving the ultimate punishment.</p> <p>Last year, the Texas legislature rejected a bill that would have barred such executions. One of the prosecutors in the Penry case, William Lee Hon, an assistant district attorney, testified against the bill.</p> <p>In an interview, Mr Hon said that he did not accept that Penry had learning disabilities, and he did not understand how the supreme court, in its 1989 opinion, agreed with such a finding. Mr Hon said that Penry was a \"sociopath\", and that he had been sent to schools for people with learning disabilities merely because he was \"an uncontrollable child\".</p> <p>Penry was one of four siblings. His mother was 18 when he was born, and she was placed in a mental institution in Oklahoma for nearly a year after his birth, according to state records.</p> <p>Penry's childhood has been described by his two sisters, an aunt, and a neighbour in court documents as one of unrelenting abuse at the hands of his mother.</p> <p>\"We were all abused, but he was abused the worst,\" said one of the sisters, Sally Belinda Potts Gonzales, who is two years younger than Penry. \"She would beat him with anything in sight. She would threaten to gouge his eyeballs out with her long fingernails. She would threaten to cut off his private parts with a butcher knife.\"</p> <p>She said that her mother had taken her brother out of school in the first grade because he had embarrassed her by getting in trouble climbing a flagpole.</p> <p>Because Penry would wander around the neighbourhood, his mother locked him in his room for long periods without food or water. \"When the poor kid got thirsty,\" his sister said, \"she'd make him drink his urine out of the toilet.\"</p> <p>Ms Gonzales added that as a child she had also seen her mother force Penry to eat his own faeces.</p> <p>Mr Hon said he did not believe the accounts of the boy's abuse because he thought family members were not telling the truth, quoting their testimony that Penry had been scalded in a bath by his mother. The prosecutor said that Mrs Penry, who is now dead, had testified she left her son in the sink near a hot water heater, and that he had grabbed a hose line and sprayed himself.</p> <p>Mr Hon said he believed the mother, adding: \"Self-mutilation, even at that early age, would not surprise me.\"</p> <p>When Penry was nine, his IQ was 56, according to a state psychologist's report. \"John seems so seriously impaired that he is incapable of intellectually functioning at anything like an age-appropriate level,\" the report said.</p> <p>At 12, Penry was institutionalised at the Mexia State School for the Mentally Retarded. When staff gave him a haircut, according to a school report, they noticed many small scars on his head. When he was asked about them, the report stated that staff were told: \"They were from cuts made by a large belt buckle which his mother used when whipping him.\"</p> <p>At 15, he was given a reading test, which required him to match drawings with the corresponding words. He identified a door as a dress, a chicken as a drum, and a hat as a flag, according to the test.</p> <p>When he was 22, Penry was convicted of rape. A state psychiatrist found that he was still a bed-wetter, that his judgment was \"severely impaired\" and that he had little regard for others or even himself.</p> <p>Penry said he had meant no harm to the woman he had raped, the psychiatrist wrote in his report, but that \"he had never had a woman before and he wanted to see what it would be like\".</p> <p><b> Shunned in prison</b><br></p> <p>He is not unaware that people say he has learning disabilities. \"They say I have a mentality of a kid, but I don't know what that means,\" he said in the prison interview. \"I wanted to learn so bad. I wanted to be just like you and everybody else. I can't. I'm very slow.\"</p> <p>Penry said he knew that some inmates avoided him. \"I have noticed some of the guys don't like talking to me because I can't carry on no conversation like most people,\" he said. \"I'm not on their level. I ask them: 'What, do I bore you?'\"</p> <p>He said he spent 21 hours a day locked in his cell and one hour out of it. When asked how many hours there were in a day, he said, \"I don't know, I think six.\" Asked how high he could count, he counted on his fingers to 10, then closed his eyes, clenched his fists and concentrated before replying: \"To 40, I think.\"</p> <p>As his execution date approaches, he said: \"I'm scared. Sometimes, I take my head and pound it against the wall so bad that it hurts.\"</p> <p>He went on: \"I walk back and forth in my house and wonder why does it have to be me.\"</p> <p>In another part of the interview, Penry talked about his belief in Santa Claus. \"They keep talking about Santa Claus being down in the North Pole.\" he said. \"Some people say it's not true. I got to where I do believe there's a Santa Claus.\"</p> <p>2000 New York Times News Service</p>",

Shunned in prison He is not unaware that people say he has learning disabilities. \"They say I have a mentality of a kid, but I don't know what that means,\" he said in the prison interview. \"I wanted to learn so bad. I wanted to be just like you and everybody else. I can't. I'm very slow.\" Penry said he knew that some inmates avoided him. \"I have noticed some of the guys don't like talking to me because I can't carry on no conversation like most people,\" he said. \"I'm not on their level. I ask them: 'What, do I bore you?'\" He said he spent 21 hours a day locked in his cell and one hour out of it. When asked how many hours there were in a day, he said, \"I don't know, I think six.\" Asked how high he could count, he counted on his fingers to 10, then closed his eyes, clenched his fists and concentrated before replying: \"To 40, I think.\" As his execution date approaches, he said: \"I'm scared. Sometimes, I take my head and pound it against the wall so bad that it hurts.\" He went on: \"I walk back and forth in my house and wonder why does it have to be me.\" In another part of the interview, Penry talked about his belief in Santa Claus. \"They keep talking about Santa Claus being down in the North Pole.\" he said. \"Some people say it's not true. I got to where I do believe there's a Santa Claus.\" 2000 New York Times News Service",

      "bodyText": "A defiant President Joseph Estrada was impeached yesterday in the Philippines congress, but insisted that he would \"face the trial\" rather than resign. There were cheers from the gallery as the house of representatives passed the indictment against Mr Estrada, on charges of corruption, in eight minutes flat. He is accused of receiving 10m pesos (\u00a3140,000) every month for nearly two years as a payoff from an illegal gambling operation run by his former crony, provincial governor Luis Singson. In another charge, Mr Estrada is said to have \"unexplained wealth\", arising from financial interests held by him and \"his wife and mistresses and their children\". There was no debate or formal vote in the house where the assent of only one-third of its members is needed to bring the impeachment motion to the senate. Government supporters complained loudly that the usual rules had not been observed, but opposition congressmen waved triumphantly and chanted \"Erap [Mr Estrada's nickname] resign\". Mr Estrada dismissed in advance a nationwide strike set by the opposition for today, saying that \"no amount of rally will force me to step down\". The president appealed to the working classes to support him, arguing that there was no need for demonstrations which would reduce confidence in the Filipino peso and threaten their jobs. \"The rally and strike will affect our countrymen, especially our poor workers who earn very little and who will go hungry if they do not get their daily wage even for one day,\" he said in a radio broadcast. But Mr Estrada himself is widely regarded as the principal cause of the peso's slide while his populist appeal has weakened. \"The economic crisis is central because Erap is seen as a negative factor,\" says the economist Professor Walden Bello. \"The fall of the currency has become a daily referendum on him.\" Working class Filipinos no longer provide active support for Mr Estrada whom they voted to power in 1998. \"But they are not going to denounce him either. They are very cynical about this whole process,\" says Mr Bello. In other articles of impeachment, Mr Estrada is accused of participating directly in real estate business through a family-controlled corporation, and in using his position to secure favours for his \"relatives, pals and friends\". He is also said to have spoken in favour of two sons who faced legal action after one was involved in a dispute at a hospital and the other failed to pay some hotel bills. Members of Mr Estrada's coalition, who still command a theoretical majority in congress, are seeking to oust key figures in the impeachment process. In a move initiated by an Estrada ally, the senate president, Franklin Drilon, a former presidential supporter who quit the coalition earlier this month and demanded Mr Estrada's resignation, was replaced by an independent , Aquilino Pimentel. Commentators believe that Mr Estrada will show he is serious about not going down without a protracted political fight. In a rival pro-Estrada rally staged on Saturday, hundreds of thousands of Filipinos had joined a \"prayer meeting\" in Manila. Many of them belonged to the charismatic Catholic movement El Shaddai which is run by the president's personal spiritual adviser. At a much smaller rally on Sunday, Mr Estrada appeared on the same platform as Imelda Marcos in her home town, Batac. She is the widow of the former president, Ferdinand Marcos, who was forced to flee in 1986 by a popular movement against his corrupt regime. After Mrs Marcos told the rally she was \"praying for the president and the Filipino people\", Mr Estrada repaid the compliment by calling her \"the most beautiful first lady in Philippine history\". The president's dwindling support sagged further after his admission last week that 400m pesos (\u00a35.6m) was channelled into a youth fund controlled by his aides. \"He basically testified against himself,\" said opposition representative Isabela Alvarez. \"He dug his own grave.\"",

Only three, who were convicted of manslaughter, were given jail terms - of just two to three years. Two were let off with warnings. The remaining six were given suspended sentences of between one and two years. The outcome of the trial came as a big setback to the drive by the German government to clamp down on the far right and promote greater tolerance of foreigners. Its campaign, which has won the backing of all Germany's mainstream parties, inspired a demonstration last week that brought more than 200,000 people on to the streets of Berlin in support of a multi-ethnic society. The general secretary of the liberal Free Democrats, Guido Westerwelle, said: \"I find it hard to take this sentence, even to the point of retaining my composure.\" Mr Westerwelle, who worked as a lawyer in the juvenile courts before entering politics, said the suspended sentences and warnings were \"incomprehensible\". Farid Guendoul from Algeria died in the town of Guben near the Polish border in January 1999. He had hurled himself through the glass door of a house to get away from his pursuers and severed an artery at the knee. He bled to death in 15 minutes. During the trial, the court heard how the defendants had set out to catch a Cuban they suspected of carrying out a machete attack on one of their associates. The judge in his summing up acknowledged that their manhunt was well-prepared: three cars were used, and the defendants coordinated their movements by mobile telephone.

The trial and the circumstances surrounding it reeked of tolerance for the activities of the neo-Nazi right. In court, the defendants felt free to pull faces, insult witnesses and deride evidence. Their lawyers held up the proceedings with a flood of objections that dragged out the hearing for 17 months. The speaker of the lower house of parliament, Wolfgang Thierse, called the delays \"scandalous\". Only one defendant pleaded guilty. He was subsequently beaten up in a disco. His co-defendants got a foretaste of the outcome when one of them was convicted of beating up an immigrant while still on trial. He was ordered to pay DM500 (\u00a3150) to charity.

      "bodyText": "Only one Florida county is likely to meet today's 5pm deadline to complete a hand count of the presidential vote, raising the prospect that hundreds of thousands of mainly Democratic votes will not be counted, and paving the way for a political crisis. As of yesterday, Governor George W Bush was still leading the presidential race in Florida by more than 380 votes after two automated counts, but Democrats have argued that that margin might be overturned if the count was checked by hand. They have also called for recounts in four populous and largely Democratic counties, where Gore supporters said there were irregularities or the possibility of an error in the machine count. Of those four counties, only Volusia (the area surrounding Daytona beach on the east Florida coast) is likely to have completed its manual count by the deadline laid down by the Florida secretary of state, Katherine Harris, for the counties to certify their vote. After completing a sample recount over the weekend, Palm Beach county authorities decided to go ahead with a full hand recount yesterday, but with about 430,000 votes to count, there seemed almost no chance the task could be completed on time. It took 11 hours for the sample count of fewer than 5,000 votes on Saturday. \"This will take six days in 14-hour shifts from 7am to 9pm,\" said the Palm Beach elections supervisor Therese LePore. She said there would be two seven-hour shifts for workers and that the count would be conducted at the county's emergency operations centre. Meanwhile, officials in Broward county only began a manual recount of a sample group of precincts yesterday. And the huge Miami-Dade area is only due to decide today on whether to have recount at all. In each county, Democrats have argued that there is reason to believe that there were irregularities in the vote-counting process which may have led to an under-counting of votes for vice-president Gore. In Volusia, where more than 184,000 votes were cast, computers which read ballot papers by optical scan broke down in one precinct, and produced an impossible result in another precinct. Meanwhile, in Palm Beach county the ballot was in the form of a punchcard, with which voters indicated their preferences by punching out a small perforated rectangle alongside their candidate's name. Democrats argued that some of those small rectangles, called \"chad\", clung to the voting card and were pushed back into their hole when the cards were fed into the vote counting machines, nullifying the vote. Furthermore, more than 19,000 votes in the county were invalidated after last Tuesday's vote because they were double-punched and hundreds of people complained that a confusing ballot paper led them to vote accidentally for the Reform Party's Pat Buchanan instead of Democrat Al Gore. Even if today's Florida deadline holds, it would not represent the end of the count, which would only come on Friday evening with a final tally of absentee ballots sent in by Americans living abroad. Republicans have argued that they traditionally win a majority of the absentee ballot as many overseas voters are in the armed forces. However, Democrats argue that they have solid support among the lower ranks in forces, and they say they expect thousands of votes from Jewish Floridians living in Israel, who traditionally support the Democratic party. Officials from Volusia county yesterday went to court in Tallahassee to lift Ms Harris's deadline. Although they expected to certify their count in time, they said they wanted to avoid any risk that the county's vote would not be counted. In announcing her decision, Ms Harris said that any county which had not completed its count and certified its vote in time would not be counted in the final Florida tally. However, the state's agriculture commissioner and electoral board member, Bob Crawford, said that if the state authorities did not receive county results by Tuesday they would certify the election with the latest machine recount from every county. Meanwhile, vote-checking and recounting was also under way in Oregon, New Mexico and Iowa were the vote was also too close too call. At one point, Mr Bush was leading by only 17 votes in New Mexico, in the closest presidential election in recent US history.",

Since she took office there have been rumblings over the number of flights she has taken at taxpayers' expense - 34 in six months last year, all but two of them over long weekends.

      "bodyText": "Last April German officials presented the Russian president Vladimir Putin with an elaborately inlaid chest and a tiny fragment of amber. They were apparently all that's left of the Amber Room , an 11-foot square, bejewelled chamber which the Prussian king gave Peter the Great in 1716. It remained at Tsarskoye Selo, the imperial residence near St Petersburg, until Nazi troops packed it up as loot in 1941. No one has seen it since. But, as Aubrey Manning reports in Unearthing Mysteries (11.0am, Radio 4), they are still looking. The eccentric workings of the European single market are examined by Mark Whitaker for File On 4 (8.0pm, Radio 4). One of the community's key policies is designed to spread the richest regions' wealth to struggling peripheral areas. Yet a British government scheme to attract private investment to the north-east has been ruled illegal. It would, the commission claimed, give some of the enterprises there an unfair advantage.",

In a report on the future of the post office network the trade and industry select committee cast doubt over the cornerstone of the government's plans to give the post offices new income, because of hostility from high street banks and unrealistic costings. The government has tried to defuse a politically explosive collapse in the network of 18,000 post offices by negotiating new markets for them, including proposals that they become a universal bank for the socially excluded. The government has proposed that banks be obliged to make their basic accounts accessible through post offices and pay for the privilege. The system would also ensure that social security benefit payments could still be paid in cash through post offices. But confidential information given to the select committee by the post office has led the MPs to warn that the banks \"will be unwilling to pay for the service unless the post office comes up with a cheaper and fairer system\". The committee concluded: \"There remains a substantial gap between the post office's aspirations to provide financial services and its ability to do so at present.\" The MPs point out that retail banks do not want a large number of their customers to switch to a new post office bank, nor will they want the rate of take-up of basic accounts to swamp their systems with non-profitable business. Each \"socially excluded\" account would need an average daily balance of \u00a31,300 to cover the annual costs of the system.

Encyclopaedic in his range of interests and intell-ectual pursuits, Flusser was renowned as a scholar of biblical and rabbinic Judaism, and of Christianity.</p> <p>Formally a historian, he lectured in the department of comparative religion at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem for more than 50 years. A scholar of both the classics and talmudic literature, he was aided by a knowledge of 26 languages, in nine of which he lectured to audiences around the world.</p> <p>Flusser lived in near obscurity, not to say penury, until his late 30s. Born in Austria, he developed his love of philology, history and animals in Prague. His family, thoroughly emancipated Austrian Jews, were tough on their physically awkward child, and sent him to the local Christian school.</p> <p>According to one of his two sons, Johanan, it was a reaction to his assimilated parents that triggered Flusser's interest in Judaism. He escaped the full horrors of the Holocaust years, but was put through a humiliating encounter with the SS on his way to receiving an exit visa from Europe, and forced to declare that he was \"a Jewish pig\".</p> <p>In Palestine in the late 1930s, he became an observant Jew and a master of biblical and talmudic texts. His interest in Christianity was stimulated by Gershom Scholem, who enabled him, in 1955, to land a secure academic position, a boon for himself and for his recently wedded wife Hannah, herself a Holocaust survivor and widow.</p> <p>Flusser's fame had a double edge. His vastly popular book on Jesus, published first in 1968 in German, and subsequently in seven other languages (including English), demonstrated how the historical Jesus was totally at home in the Jewish and rabbinical environment of his time. It was only later that Christianity emerged through the hands of others less sympathetic to, and certainly not as knowledgeable of, their saviour's Jewish roots. Only his thorough knowledge of Greek and Jewish sources allowed Flusser to compare the Jewish original and the early Christians' distorted interpretations.</p> <p>Flusser came to admire - and even to love - Jesus, seeing in him a legitimate heir to the Hebrew prophets, a man possessed of the holy spirit. When he spoke of this kinship with the Dominican priest and philosopher, Father Marcel Dubois, he referred to him as, \"My teacher and your God\".</p> <p>A ccording to Dubois, one of the highest level intellectuals Rome ever sent to the holy land, Flusser's Jesus changed New Testament scholarship radically. Flusser was a free spirit, observed Dubois, and because he was serious about spiritual matters, he was able to believe in Jesus' spirituality and yet stay an observant Jew. \"He saw the real significance of religion - of God's way to speak to humankind; at the same time, he saw the humour in it.\" Unlike his fellow professor and friend-in-combat, Yehoshua Leibowitz, who stressed the differences between Judaism and Christianity, Flusser saw \"the deep connections\".</p> <p>Of the many prizes that he was awarded, the prestigious Israel Prize for his redaction of the 10th-century book, The Josippon, was probably his most coveted. It marked his central concern with late antiquity and its historical repercussions in Jewish history.</p> <p>The New Testament And Christian-Jewish Dialogue, an English language festschrift in Flusser's honour, published by the Ecumenical Theological Research Fraternity in Israel (no 24/25), contains a bibliography of Flusser's books and more than 700 articles. It also contains a warm appreciation of the man himself by both Jewish and Christian scholars.</p> <p>Flusser is survived by his wife, two sons and seven grandchildren</p> <p>\u0095 David Flusser, biblical scholar, born September 15 1917; died September 15 2000</p>",

He escaped the full horrors of the Holocaust years, but was put through a humiliating encounter with the SS on his way to receiving an exit visa from Europe, and forced to declare that he was \"a Jewish pig\". In Palestine in the late 1930s, he became an observant Jew and a master of biblical and talmudic texts. His interest in Christianity was stimulated by Gershom Scholem, who enabled him, in 1955, to land a secure academic position, a boon for himself and for his recently wedded wife Hannah, herself a Holocaust survivor and widow. Flusser's fame had a double edge. His vastly popular book on Jesus, published first in 1968 in German, and subsequently in seven other languages (including English), demonstrated how the historical Jesus was totally at home in the Jewish and rabbinical environment of his time. It was only later that Christianity emerged through the hands of others less sympathetic to, and certainly not as knowledgeable of, their saviour's Jewish roots. Only his thorough knowledge of Greek and Jewish sources allowed Flusser to compare the Jewish original and the early Christians' distorted interpretations. Flusser came to admire - and even to love - Jesus, seeing in him a legitimate heir to the Hebrew prophets, a man possessed of the holy spirit. When he spoke of this kinship with the Dominican priest and philosopher, Father Marcel Dubois, he referred to him as, \"My teacher and your God\". A ccording to Dubois, one of the highest level intellectuals Rome ever sent to the holy land, Flusser's Jesus changed New Testament scholarship radically. Flusser was a free spirit, observed Dubois, and because he was serious about spiritual matters, he was able to believe in Jesus' spirituality and yet stay an observant Jew. \"He saw the real significance of religion - of God's way to speak to humankind; at the same time, he saw the humour in it.\" Unlike his fellow professor and friend-in-combat, Yehoshua Leibowitz, who stressed the differences between Judaism and Christianity, Flusser saw \"the deep connections\". Of the many prizes that he was awarded, the prestigious Israel Prize for his redaction of the 10th-century book, The Josippon, was probably his most coveted. It marked his central concern with late antiquity and its historical repercussions in Jewish history. The New Testament And Christian-Jewish Dialogue, an English language festschrift in Flusser's honour, published by the Ecumenical Theological Research Fraternity in Israel (no 24/25), contains a bibliography of Flusser's books and more than 700 articles. It also contains a warm appreciation of the man himself by both Jewish and Christian scholars. Flusser is survived by his wife, two sons and seven grandchildren \u0095 David Flusser, biblical scholar, born September 15 1917; died September 15 2000",

      "body": "<p>This is a story about a family breakdown. A separation, a divorce and a child's education. The child is Nicole Lavelle. When she was 12 years old, her parents split up. Two years later they divorced and Nicole went to live with her father in Dunblane, near Stirling, while her mother and sister moved to the Midlands. </p> <p>Callum Lavelle, a senior computer executive, enrolled his daughter at Harrogate Ladies' College, a boarding school which she liked at first. But she soon began to miss home and family life. </p> <p>She wanted to move to a school closer to her mother, but according to Nicole, her father did not approve. As she sees it, he was happy to pay the \u00a312,000 fees for Harrogate, but when she decided to go to King's School, Worcester, to be near her mother, he withdrew his support. </p> <p>Last week Nicole, now 16, made legal history when she took her father to court to force him to pay her annual \u00a36,600 school fees. He claims he simply cannot afford to pay regular fees for private education at the moment; she argues the only explanation for his action is the continuing feud between her parents. </p> <p>The Lavelles' case is a vivid illustration of how schools are increasingly being used as a battleground for estranged parents. Last week King's School was understandably reluctant to comment on the case. \"It's a private matter between Nicole and her father,\" a spokesperson said. </p> <p>Private it should be, but increasingly, with the breakdown of marriages and the ever-diversifying range of family situations in Britain today, our schools - under-funded and over-stretched - are finding themselves caught up in the battles between warring parents. And there's nothing private about it then. </p> <p>Such cases do not often reach the courts. Many separated or divorced couples remain on reasonable terms in the interests of their children and their children's education. They reach amicable agreements; schools are informed and staff can then try to take into account the new family situation of the child concerned. </p> <p>But in another case earlier this year an unnamed Englishwoman was ordered by two judges to send her children to a French-speaking school against her wishes. Her estranged husband, a Frenchman, wanted them to retain their language and cultural background. In that case, one of the children's head teachers was dragged into the fray, making a plea to the court asking that the girl should be allowed remain in her English-speaking school. </p> <p>Cynthia Thumwood, headteacher of Hanover Primary School in Islington, London, often finds herself involved with the fall-out from family breakdowns. \"The most difficult thing is when it's acrimonious and the legal beagles are involved. We often find as a school that parents want to use you as piggy-in-the-middle to gather evidence against the other parent. </p> <p>\"Often it's not centred around the welfare of the child but around the acrimony between parents - when they want to make things difficult for the other parent.

      "bodyText": "This is a story about a family breakdown. A separation, a divorce and a child's education. The child is Nicole Lavelle. When she was 12 years old, her parents split up. Two years later they divorced and Nicole went to live with her father in Dunblane, near Stirling, while her mother and sister moved to the Midlands. Callum Lavelle, a senior computer executive, enrolled his daughter at Harrogate Ladies' College, a boarding school which she liked at first. But she soon began to miss home and family life. She wanted to move to a school closer to her mother, but according to Nicole, her father did not approve. As she sees it, he was happy to pay the \u00a312,000 fees for Harrogate, but when she decided to go to King's School, Worcester, to be near her mother, he withdrew his support. Last week Nicole, now 16, made legal history when she took her father to court to force him to pay her annual \u00a36,600 school fees. He claims he simply cannot afford to pay regular fees for private education at the moment; she argues the only explanation for his action is the continuing feud between her parents. The Lavelles' case is a vivid illustration of how schools are increasingly being used as a battleground for estranged parents. Last week King's School was understandably reluctant to comment on the case. \"It's a private matter between Nicole and her father,\" a spokesperson said. Private it should be, but increasingly, with the breakdown of marriages and the ever-diversifying range of family situations in Britain today, our schools - under-funded and over-stretched - are finding themselves caught up in the battles between warring parents. And there's nothing private about it then. Such cases do not often reach the courts. Many separated or divorced couples remain on reasonable terms in the interests of their children and their children's education. They reach amicable agreements; schools are informed and staff can then try to take into account the new family situation of the child concerned. But in another case earlier this year an unnamed Englishwoman was ordered by two judges to send her children to a French-speaking school against her wishes. Her estranged husband, a Frenchman, wanted them to retain their language and cultural background. In that case, one of the children's head teachers was dragged into the fray, making a plea to the court asking that the girl should be allowed remain in her English-speaking school. Cynthia Thumwood, headteacher of Hanover Primary School in Islington, London, often finds herself involved with the fall-out from family breakdowns. \"The most difficult thing is when it's acrimonious and the legal beagles are involved. We often find as a school that parents want to use you as piggy-in-the-middle to gather evidence against the other parent. \"Often it's not centred around the welfare of the child but around the acrimony between parents - when they want to make things difficult for the other parent. As a school you can't get involved. You have to keep reminding people that's their private affair and they must deal with it.\" In the 11 years that Lesley Hughes has been head of Longcroft School, a comprehensive with 1,500 pupils in Beverley, East Riding, Yorkshire, the school has rarely become directly involved in an acrimonious family breakdown - although on one occasion an aggrieved, angry parent turned up at school demanding access to their child which had been denied by the courts. \"One of the issues we've become more aware of is the need to be very clear about what the situation is in law,\" said Hughes. Because there was a custody order in place, and the school was clear about where it stood legally, it was able to act decisively and say \"no\". Longcroft, like other schools, is increasingly having to cater for estranged parents, both of whom are interested in and concerned about their child's development, but who may wish to see the school separately. \"In the past (separated) parents have made joint appointments to talk about their child's progress, but we have had more parents wanting separate appointments,\" she said. Schools face an infinite number of practical problems involved in dealing with changes in families. Increasingly, there is no single main adult contact between home and school; that contact may not be the child's parent; and children may divide their time between two households. And schools still largely revolve around an outdated model of the family - two parents who can come to parents' evening (often held early in the evening, when most working parents are still in the office) and a non-working mother at home who can be contacted at all times.

Without this kind of personal connection, the programme would lose its force. \"It works because they know what I think of them and how I believe in them and how I want them to succeed,\" she says.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I remember being very impressed, upon starting secondary school, to discover that it had its own swimming pool. I knew of no other local schools that enjoyed a dip on their doorstep. When it was demolished - subsidence, I think - not long after I left the school, it felt like a real loss. </p> <p>There was one problem with my admiration for the pool: I couldn't swim. At the age of 11, in fact, I'd have had trouble getting across its 5m width, even with the assistance of floats, armbands, and fins and flippers of my own. The thought of doing the same without these back-ups was a less likely prospect than passing my A-levels in that first term. </p> <p>As it turned out, neither of these fantasies was to come true during my time at the school. Exams followed their normal course as, I suppose, did my swimming lessons, given the fact that not one of us who was not already \"water confident\" ever made it down to the deep end. A report last week by Ofsted into swimming provision at key stage 2 - the only level of the national curriculum at which swimming is compulsory - confirmed that my experience was far from unusual: almost one in five children now leaves primary school unable to swim the 25m specified in the curriculum. As swimming declines to optional status at secondary level, those who haven't managed the length of a pool by the time they leave year 6 are unlikely ever to catch up with their peers. </p> <p>\"There is this one window of opportunity at key stage 2 and it has to be grabbed,\" says David Sparkes, chief executive of the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA). \"After that, many people feel embarrassed that they can't swim, and that puts a barrier up. Very few secondary schools actually offer swimming, so it's unlikely that the inability to swim will be picked up after the age of 11.\" </p> <p>Even if the opportunity for further instruction is there, learning to swim in the teenage years is a fraught business. During my brief spell of primary school lessons, I enjoyed it - although the same could probably not be said for the teacher charged with cramming my waist-length hair into a recalcitrant swimming cap. The Ofsted report, in fact, praised pupils' responses to the lessons at KS2, stating, \"the overwhelming majority of pupils looked forward to their lessons\". </p> <p>But all this changed, for me, at secondary school. A combination of adolescent self-consciousness (mine) and adolescent bitchiness (everyone else) meant that I was never likely to emerge victorious at the end of a 25m front crawl. \"Forgotten\" costumes, rather too frequent periods and, when actually forced into the pool, a display of utter terror were called into play by me, and other non-swimmers, to make sure we would never join the ranks of those who sped from one end of the pool to another. Floats, at this crucial stage of teen image-forming, were unthinkable. Failure was the more comfortable option. </p> <p>For those charged with getting the nation's children treading water, this won't do. Figures from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) reveal that the third most common cause of accidental death for those aged under 14 is drowning - due, it claims, to children's misjudgments of their ability and a failure to appreciate the dangers of water. The last annual survey recorded a 50% increase in deaths by drowning in this age group. More than half of those who drowned could swim. </p> <p>\"The national curriculum includes water safety, but a lot of youngsters are just not getting this knowledge,\" says Sparkes. Val Sumner, technical support officer at the Royal Life Saving Society (RLSS), part of the Swim for Life campaign that fought to get swimming into schools, agrees. \"The time devoted to swimming and water safety in the average primary school is negligible. You can't expect to turn all non-swimmers into confident swimmers in the time they have.\" </p> <p>The problems, as with so many issues in education, rarely come down to natural ability. Ofsted inspectors noted that, while 91% of pupils in rural schools reached the 25m target by the age of 11, just 67% of those in the most deprived areas managed the same. An average of 5.29 hours per year was spent on swimming lessons in the most advantaged schools, compared to 3.49 hours in their least well-off counterparts. The report notes, tellingly, that those schools with the best record of provision for non-swimmers were those which \"encouraged [parents] to join a swimming club or go swimming together at the local pool\". In other words, it's often what happens outside school swimming lessons that determines whether the key stage 2 target is met. </p> <p>This is hardly a surprise. With all the other pressures on the curriculum, schools are hard-pressed to find time to teach everything. Competence in swimming - in which success is monitored by Ofsted, but does not count towards league table position - is a less urgent concern. Sumner confirms that it is often not in the school's interest to push children to become better swimmers. \"Once you've achieved that attainment target of 25m, there's no point in continuing the lessons,\" she explains. \"Walking to the pool and back, getting changed - that's one and a half hours of valuable lesson time for a 20-minute swim.\" </p> <p>Worse, many schools have no members of staff qualified to teach swimming, forcing them to pay instructors' fees. The ASA would like to see government funds ringfenced for lessons and more help for training teachers. A scheme in conjunction with BT is already up and running but, says Sparkes, more support is needed. </p> <p>Schools cannot levy charges for transport or lessons that take place within school hours, but they can ask for voluntary contributions; one-quarter of schools fund KS2 swimming in this way. Add the yearly costs of pool use and instructor fees (anything from \u00a31,000 to \u00a39,000, according to Ofsted), and the fact that most children learn to swim outside school time, and the arguments for forcing schools to take responsibility for swimming look weak. Over half, in fact, have slashed the time they devote to it over the past three years. </p> <p>But the experts see problems in abandoning the statutory commitment to teach water competence. \"Swimming is not getting the attention it needs in schools, and the result is that we are seeing a nation of appalling adult swimmers,\" says Sumner. \"If adults themselves are less competent, then they're less able to teach. It's a downward spiral.\" </p> <p><strong>What is the best way to teach a child to swim?</strong><br></p> <p> Advice from experts and the experience of parents provide a model swimming guide for children. The problem is, it bears little relation to that practised in schools. </p> <p>Swimming is a compulsory element of key stage 2, although schools have the option to introduce it in the earlier key stage 1. Most lessons, according to Ofsted findings, actually take place in year 5, when children are nine or 10. But experts suggest that the ideal time to learn is somewhat earlier. </p> <p>\"The longer you leave it, the more difficult it gets,\" says David Sparkes of the Amateur Swimming Association. \"The best age to learn is about six, when there are no built-in inhibitions. It's a good time to teach them: their co-ordination, strength and motor skills are about right.\" </p> <p>It's a view backed up by Val Sumner of the Royal Life Saving Society. \"The critical time is usually about the age of seven,\" she says. \"Of course, some will swim younger and some will swim older. But, for most, seven is the age when their bodies and their mental processes are sufficiently developed. Little children will become more water confident with lessons, but in terms of making satisfactory progress, the child needs to be around the seven years mark.\" </p> <p>The problem for schools is that their pupils' seventh birthdays clash with compulsory testing for KS1: many simply cannot afford the time away from the classroom. Some might even be hoping that, by year 5, parents will already have taken the initiative. </p> <p>Joanna Smith, with three children aged eight, six and two, did exactly that. Her eldest daughter, Rosie, had a term of swimming lessons at school; Elinor, six, has had none so far. Both have begun private swimming lessons with an instructor who teaches only two children at a time. \"They didn't do classes properly at school,\" she says. \"The truth is that, as with many things, swimming is better done on a smaller class basis, and that's too much to ask of a school.\" </p> <p>Sumner agrees that the current set-up in schools of lessons spread over a term is inefficient. \"It needs more organisation - a term's worth concentrated over 10 days would be far more effective. It corresponds to the manner in which children learn.\" </p> <p>Smith's daughters have certainly found the intensity of one-to-two lessons more productive. The drawback, she admits, is the cost. </p> <p>\"It is expensive - I pay \u00a3100 for a six-week course - and how on earth could a DfEE budget stretch to that?\"</p>",

Due to the new government guidelines, children in years 4 and 5 will now be expected to build on the skills they've acquired in class by doing half an hour of homework, four or five times a week. All children will be taking homework diaries home with them. Please sign these to let us know that your child has done the work. There will be a place for you to write down how you think your children are coming along. We will use the same book to pass on information that we think you might find useful. </p> <p>A day or two later my nine-year-old daughter announced at breakfast that she'd forgotten to put her spelling words into sentences. She began to cry and told me that now she was going to be punished by being kept in at break. As we still had plenty of time, I sat Helen down and got her started. This was when I found out there was a form she had to follow. But she could not quite remember it. </p> <p>We muddled through and later that week she told me she had done badly on her homework because she'd done it in pencil, not pen. But that was just a little error, I insisted. What had the teacher said to make her think she'd done badly? \"I only got three stars. Some people got four. I'll never get four.\" It was the first time she'd ever talked about her schoolwork being marked. </p> <p>On Wednesday night, we were meant to practice her tables. And we did, for hours, because every time I tried to stop, Helen started worrying about the ones she still didn't know. Then on Friday she woke up crying at 3am and told me she was worried she was not going to have enough time to finish her homework by Monday. Her assignment was to take a story she loved and give it a new ending. She wanted to rewrite Helen of Troy, but she was afraid that if she got it wrong, she wouldn't even get ONE star. It took me most of Sunday to calm her down enough to get her to give it a try. </p> <p>So yes, I did speak to her teacher, who was appalled and concerned. She made it clear to Helen that she was not in any danger of getting punished. The homework kept coming, but with the two of us working together to reassure Helen, she found her confidence. She can still tell me exactly how many people in her class got more stars than she did, and how many got fewer. But she also insists that she likes getting stars, because \"that way I know if my homework is good or not and before when I only did things in class I never knew.\" </p> <p>Both her father and I have come to like the homework routine, too. We have a much clearer idea of what she's learning, and the bigger, more creative projects she has at weekends are fun to help her with. My six-year-old, who has watched all this from a jealous distance, seems to associate homework with getting a lot of attention. Two weeks ago, when her teacher told her that her homework was to read for 20 minutes, she told me it was the happiest day of her life. </p> <p>However, it's clear when I ask around that our case is not typical. A friend with a very active son the same age has such a hard time making him sit down that they are spending up to three hours a night on homework that should take 30 minutes. Another friend who works three nights a week is distraught because her dyslexic babysitter can't help her children. Another is thinking of taking her child out of after-school ballet, because she's too tired to do homework when she gets home. None of the above are against homework, but they don't understand why it has suddenly become such a big deal. They also wonder if it is advisable for children so young. </p> <p>They are in good company. The \"Homework Question\" is as old as it is difficult to answer. Educators have been arguing about it in this country since homework became commonplace in the mid-19th century. The average workload has gone up and down in keeping with political ideologies. Whenever there has been widespread public concern about \"falling standards\", schools have responded to the crisis by assigning more homework. Eventually a moment arrives when they give one assignment too many, then there is uproar about the cruelty of it all. Schools respond by assigning less and less until one day someone asks why it is that standards are dropping and draws the inevitable, if oversimplified, conclusion: more homework needed. </p> <p>That's where we are at the moment. Since home-school agreements were introduced last year, most parents have had to sign a statement saying they will help their children with their homework. The guidelines published by the DfEE last year recommend that children in years 1, 2, and 3 do one hour of homework a week, and that children in years 5 and 6 do half an hour five times a week. Primary schools are under no obligation to assign homework but are expected to make their policy explicit. </p> <p>According to the 1997 Ofsted study on which the government's guidelines are based, schools with successful homework strategies are ones in which homework is appropriate to the age of the child and increases gradually over time. Feedback is clear and prompt; rewards and sanctions are clear and consistent. There is extra guidance and support for those who need it. Parents and teachers \"work in partnership\". </p> <p>There is simply an assumption that homework is a good thing. However, outside of government departments, the consensus is less secure. New research published today by Parentline Plus suggests that homework anxiety amongst both children and their parents is a much larger problem than the DfEE realises. Four hundred parents who called the helpline were surveyed about their children's school-related problems. Bullying emerged as their greatest concern; but homework was not far behind. </p> <p>In a related pilot study specifically about homework problems, Parentline Plus found that parents were not just lacking in confidence but also unclear as to exactly what their children were expected to do, and what role they were meant to play as parents. </p> <p>They needed better information from schools, not just about the actual assignments, but about how much help they were meant to provide. Many also wanted the schools to provide workshops, so that they could have a general idea of what their children were learning. Maths was the subject they wanted most help with, but there was also a high level of uneasiness expressed by parents who had schooled in a very different way, in this country and abroad. </p> <p>Many educators are uneasy, too. A 1999 study led by Steve Timms of Durham University found there was no evidence that homework in primary schools boosted academic performance, and some evidence that it might even cause harm. In the same year, David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, warned that too much homework could mean no time for sports and hobbies. </p> <p>There is also widespread concern in the profession that clumsily constructed homework policies could lead to a widening of the gap between children with educated parents and children whose parents who have no English or who left school early. In a MORI poll conducted last winter, a third of parents admitted to being worried about making mistakes while helping their children. </p> <p>Even those who think homework can be a good thing point out that, actually, it's hard to prove. Those schools deemed most successful tend to be the ones with successful homework policies, but this is only one of many factors. Even if it had been established that more homework led directly to higher Sats scores (and it hasn't), it is not clear that high achievement at seven or 11 leads directly to high achievement in secondary school - or in life. </p> <p>So the question is, why is Blunkett going to all this trouble, when it's not clear what the benefits are? According to Dr Richard Cowan, of the Institute of Education at the University of London, the government has two larger projects in mind. The first is to train parents so that they can play a key part in the education process. However, there is a long way to go, he thinks; right now, schools are telling parents what to do rather than engaging with them as equal partners. </p> <p>Dr Cowan has higher hopes for the government's second, even loftier, project: this, he thinks, is to produce a new generation of workers who take the initiative. Homework is seen as a practice that breeds such qualities - and, certainly, that is how I would describe the transformation I've seen in my daughter over the past two months. But it's a programme that needs fine-tuning so that the needs of each child are taken into account. </p> <p>In the best-case scenario, homework could become the vehicle by which parents and teachers learned to work with each other more closely. But according to Dorit Braun, chief executive of Parentline Plus, there has to be a big change in the way schools engage with pupils and their families. \"They need to be more explicit. They need to communicate more effectively.\" Last but not least, she says, they need to forget about targets and Ofsted from time to time, and remind themselves \"who schools are for\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "It began with a chirpy letter. Dear Parents, it said. Due to the new government guidelines, children in years 4 and 5 will now be expected to build on the skills they've acquired in class by doing half an hour of homework, four or five times a week. All children will be taking homework diaries home with them. Please sign these to let us know that your child has done the work. There will be a place for you to write down how you think your children are coming along. We will use the same book to pass on information that we think you might find useful. A day or two later my nine-year-old daughter announced at breakfast that she'd forgotten to put her spelling words into sentences. She began to cry and told me that now she was going to be punished by being kept in at break. As we still had plenty of time, I sat Helen down and got her started. This was when I found out there was a form she had to follow. But she could not quite remember it. We muddled through and later that week she told me she had done badly on her homework because she'd done it in pencil, not pen. But that was just a little error, I insisted.

      "body": "<p>Prisoners and prostitutes are now students of Wales' most ancient seat of learning - a thought to have the bishop who founded it spinning in his grave. But Bishop David Burgess would be even more surprised to find a mosque housed in the college he founded in 1822 to train men for the church. </p> <p>Lampeter's grey stone quadrangle - an Oxbridge college dropped onto the Welsh hills - is still standing, its chapel still in daily use, but the smallest public university in Europe is having to run hard to stand still. The mosque signals the presence of many Muslim students, who are attracted by the renowned department of theology, religious studies and Islamic studies. It is also a sign that Bishop David has been followed as a benefactor of the university by Sheikh Khalifa of Abu Dhabi and the rulers of Bahrain and Qatar. Their \u00a31.8m endowment helps fund Islamic studies in the heart of rural Wales. </p> <p>The prisoners and prostitutes, on the other hand, are among the increasing band of Lampeter's distance-learning students - some of the 2,500 people now working towards a degree in voluntary sector studies. The university's Welsh department has uncovered a worldwide appetite for learning the language via the internet - more than 600 signed up, half from Wales and the rest scattered from Korea to Sweden to Puerto Rico. (One Slovakian student was so taken with Catatonia's Cerys Matthews that apparently she just had to learn the language.) </p> <p>Unique it may be, but the University of Wales, Lampeter, to give it its full title, is a microcosm of the threats facing Welsh higher education - and the ingenuity with which parts of the sector are responding. </p> <p>Size is one problem. With little more than 1,000 undergraduates on campus, Lampeter has the numbers of a school but has to provide the education of a university - with the library, the computing and the specialist lecturers that entails. </p> <p>It is not a problem for the students - all the ones I met were extraordinarily positive about the experience and didn't pine for the bright city lights. </p> <p>Caroline Gradwell, a third year student from Blackpool studying English, said she wanted to stay after graduating. \"There are lots of people living in the hills in caravans because they can't bear to leave Lampeter. I love it - I wouldn't have gone anywhere else. It's friendly, no one feels isolated or on their own. The lecturers know your name and you feel people take an interest in you rather than just your tuition fees.\" </p> <p>Adam D'Arcy found it a big change from his home city of Edinburgh but is enjoying his anthropology and archaeology course - and being on the student union executive. </p> <p>In a small town without a cinema or night club, the student union takes on a lot of significance - there's entertainment as long as you make it yourself. There is a thriving gay and lesbian society. </p> <p>FJ Ali is among the 30% of mature students - she went to art college in London 12 years ago and worked in the fashion trade before coming to Lampeter to study anthropology and Islamic studies. (This was despite the Big Issue branding it the dullest university in the country at the time she took the plunge.) </p> <p>\"The age range is very varied,\" she says. \"It's an education in itself just being here - it's very cosmopolitan for the middle of Wales! It has a family feel - there's no division between lecturers and students. It's a great lifestyle if you've got an enthusiasm to learn. It prepares you socially better than any other university. It's not just teenagers - it prepares you to deal with a varied social world.\" </p> <p>Enthusiastic though the students are, there are fewer of them. Three years ago intake was about 450 a year. Last year it was 350, and this October dropped to 300. One whole hall of residence is empty. </p> <p>Lampeter has been hit by three trends sparked by the introduction of tuition fees - a triple whammy, according to Professor David \"DP\" Davies, the pro-vice chancellor. Mature students - one of the university's strong points - have become more reluctant to take full-time degrees for fear of debt. More students are living at home, or at least in their home areas where they can find term-time jobs more easily; Lampeter's local population is sparse. And the trend towards more vocational subjects, as students want to be sure of paying off their debts, does not suit the university's strengths in classics, archaeology and religious studies. </p> <p>This year things got worse. Figures for admissions to Welsh universities are expected to show an overall drop of 10%, attributed to the last-minute rise in recruitment by the old, well-placed universities in England when they were given more leeway by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The knock-on effect was to take students from many of the new universities - and from Wales. </p> <p>\"A place like ours is finding it increasingly difficult to provide the level of service that students and staff working in a university expect to have in terms of administration, computing network, library etc. Technology doesn't stand still, and you need more skilled people to keep it going,\" explains Davies. </p> <p> Lampeter has compensated by moving swiftly into part-time undergraduate and masters degrees, often through distance learning. Theology is now taught in church groups around Wales and England, and there is a Masters in Celtic Christianity with summer schools in Ireland. \"We are a long way from London, but very close to Ireland and some of us are beginning to look west. The European Union is keen on partnerships in other nation states.\" </p> <p>The religious studies department (ironically one of the biggest in the country, where Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and the Chinese traditions of Taoism and Confucianism are all taught by believers) is also beginning to attract more international students. Lampeter is discussing a merger with Newport 90 miles away - but seems in no rush. </p> <p>Size is definitely a problem for Wales, where small institutions are a feature of higher education - 13 serving a student population that in England would be catered for by five or six institutions of 12,000 to 15,000. </p> <p>Last year the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales detonated a bombshell by proposing precisely that. The case for mergers was argued in the light of the need for new technologies and flexibility. \"What is striking about developments in the provision of learning opportunities is the extent to which the significance of the campus is diminishing. Courses are taken out to the work place, continuous attendance on campus is not a requirement for learning, staff (particularly where a division of labour occurs) need not all be located in the same place.\" </p> <p>Previous mergers \"prompted\" by the funding council - the Welsh Agricultural College with Aberystwyth and Coleg Normal with Bangor - had both been timely and prevented more severe difficulties developing, said the document, which bemoaned the reluctance of Welsh institutions to consider mergers. Proposals for Lampeter to join with Trinity College Carmarthen and be tween Swansea and the Swansea Institute of Higher Education had come to nothing: \"The Council believes the evidence provided above points inexorably to the increasing problems likely to be faced by relatively small institutions, and concludes that Wales should aim for fewer, larger, institutions.\" </p> <p>The merger plan has been put on ice as the Welsh Assembly's new Labour/Liberal Democrat leadership orders a complete review of post-16 education. Steve Martin, the funding council's new chief executive remarks: \"Although there is a degree of collaboration, we still have a disproportionate number of relatively small institutions in a world that demands increasing economies of scale.\" </p> <p>But he is quick to disavow any intention to issue merger directives. \"They are independent institutions -we can't make them do things,\" he said more than once during our interview. But there will have to be more collaboration both between higher education institutions and with further education colleges -something potentially easier in Wales as the funding bodies for the two sectors are under one executive. </p> <p>Welsh universities must not only compete with English ones for students and staff - the competition is global. Sir Adrian Webb, vice-chancellor of Glamorgan University, says they cannot afford to lag behind in developing new teaching and learning methods: \"It is all expensive in hardware, software, staff time to develop curricula and prepare materials.\" He is critical of the merger document but believes a smaller number of big organisations - not necessarily merged - and a number of small collegial ones, might be best. </p> <p>The assembly, unlike the Scottish parliament, has no direct powers over universities or student funding, though it may come to test the limits of the current arrangements and has made an extra \u00a315m available for student hardship. What not all its politicians appreciate is the dependence of Welsh universities on England - 55% of their students are from outside Wales, predominantly from England (even if some have Welsh family connections). And ironically it is the most Welsh institutions - Aberystwyth, Bangor, Lampeter - that are the most dependent. </p> <p>And it is easy for students - and staff - to travel in the other direction. From South Wales it is quicker to get to London than the north of the principality, where Liverpool and Manchester are in easy reach. Professor Phil Gummett, the new director of higher education for the Welsh funding council, points out that most academics could take a job at an English university without moving house. </p> <p>How would the assembly - and Welsh academia - react to the idea that their future is so bound up with England that the eventual outcome will be a northern consortium linked to Manchester and/or Liverpool and perhaps two or three institutions in south Wales tied to Bath or Bristol? That is the prediction of one highly placed insider in the Welsh establishment, who says: \"I don't think the Welsh higher education system is big enough to cope.\" Prudently, he remains anonymous. </p> <p><strong> Full-timers in Welsh higher education in 1998/99 </strong> </p> <p>U of Glamorgan <strong> 10,477</strong> </p> <p>U of Wales, Aberystwyth <strong> 6,903</strong> </p> <p>U of Wales, Bangor <strong> 7,020</strong> </p> <p>Cardiff <strong> 15,658</strong> </p> <p>U of Wales, Lampeter <strong> 1,401</strong> </p> <p>U of Wales, Swansea <strong> 9,242</strong> </p> <p>U of Wales, Coll of Medicine <strong> 2,326</strong> </p> <p>U of Wales Institute, Cardiff <strong> 5,904</strong> </p> <p>U of Wales Coll, Newport <strong> 3,004</strong> </p> <p>North East Wales Institute <strong> 2,637</strong> </p> <p>Swansea Inst of HE <strong> 3,129</strong> </p> <p>Trinity College Carmathen <strong> 1,197</strong> </p> <p>Welsh Coll of Music/Drama <strong> 513 </strong></p> <p>Total <strong>69,411</strong> </p> <p> \u0095 The scope for institutional mergers: <a href=\"http://www.wfc.ac.uk/education/hefcw/pub99/w99101he.html\">www.wfc.ac.uk/education/</a></p>",

(This was despite the Big Issue branding it the dullest university in the country at the time she took the plunge.) \"The age range is very varied,\" she says. \"It's an education in itself just being here - it's very cosmopolitan for the middle of Wales! It has a family feel - there's no division between lecturers and students. It's a great lifestyle if you've got an enthusiasm to learn. It prepares you socially better than any other university. It's not just teenagers - it prepares you to deal with a varied social world.\" Enthusiastic though the students are, there are fewer of them. Three years ago intake was about 450 a year. Last year it was 350, and this October dropped to 300. One whole hall of residence is empty. Lampeter has been hit by three trends sparked by the introduction of tuition fees - a triple whammy, according to Professor David \"DP\" Davies, the pro-vice chancellor. Mature students - one of the university's strong points - have become more reluctant to take full-time degrees for fear of debt. More students are living at home, or at least in their home areas where they can find term-time jobs more easily; Lampeter's local population is sparse. And the trend towards more vocational subjects, as students want to be sure of paying off their debts, does not suit the university's strengths in classics, archaeology and religious studies. This year things got worse. Figures for admissions to Welsh universities are expected to show an overall drop of 10%, attributed to the last-minute rise in recruitment by the old, well-placed universities in England when they were given more leeway by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The knock-on effect was to take students from many of the new universities - and from Wales. \"A place like ours is finding it increasingly difficult to provide the level of service that students and staff working in a university expect to have in terms of administration, computing network, library etc. Technology doesn't stand still, and you need more skilled people to keep it going,\" explains Davies. Lampeter has compensated by moving swiftly into part-time undergraduate and masters degrees, often through distance learning. Theology is now taught in church groups around Wales and England, and there is a Masters in Celtic Christianity with summer schools in Ireland. \"We are a long way from London, but very close to Ireland and some of us are beginning to look west. The European Union is keen on partnerships in other nation states.\" The religious studies department (ironically one of the biggest in the country, where Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and the Chinese traditions of Taoism and Confucianism are all taught by believers) is also beginning to attract more international students. Lampeter is discussing a merger with Newport 90 miles away - but seems in no rush. Size is definitely a problem for Wales, where small institutions are a feature of higher education - 13 serving a student population that in England would be catered for by five or six institutions of 12,000 to 15,000. Last year the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales detonated a bombshell by proposing precisely that. The case for mergers was argued in the light of the need for new technologies and flexibility. \"What is striking about developments in the provision of learning opportunities is the extent to which the significance of the campus is diminishing. Courses are taken out to the work place, continuous attendance on campus is not a requirement for learning, staff (particularly where a division of labour occurs) need not all be located in the same place.\" Previous mergers \"prompted\" by the funding council - the Welsh Agricultural College with Aberystwyth and Coleg Normal with Bangor - had both been timely and prevented more severe difficulties developing, said the document, which bemoaned the reluctance of Welsh institutions to consider mergers. Proposals for Lampeter to join with Trinity College Carmarthen and be tween Swansea and the Swansea Institute of Higher Education had come to nothing: \"The Council believes the evidence provided above points inexorably to the increasing problems likely to be faced by relatively small institutions, and concludes that Wales should aim for fewer, larger, institutions.\" The merger plan has been put on ice as the Welsh Assembly's new Labour/Liberal Democrat leadership orders a complete review of post-16 education. Steve Martin, the funding council's new chief executive remarks: \"Although there is a degree of collaboration, we still have a disproportionate number of relatively small institutions in a world that demands increasing economies of scale.\" But he is quick to disavow any intention to issue merger directives. \"They are independent institutions -we can't make them do things,\" he said more than once during our interview. But there will have to be more collaboration both between higher education institutions and with further education colleges -something potentially easier in Wales as the funding bodies for the two sectors are under one executive. Welsh universities must not only compete with English ones for students and staff - the competition is global. Sir Adrian Webb, vice-chancellor of Glamorgan University, says they cannot afford to lag behind in developing new teaching and learning methods: \"It is all expensive in hardware, software, staff time to develop curricula and prepare materials.\" He is critical of the merger document but believes a smaller number of big organisations - not necessarily merged - and a number of small collegial ones, might be best. The assembly, unlike the Scottish parliament, has no direct powers over universities or student funding, though it may come to test the limits of the current arrangements and has made an extra \u00a315m available for student hardship. What not all its politicians appreciate is the dependence of Welsh universities on England - 55% of their students are from outside Wales, predominantly from England (even if some have Welsh family connections). And ironically it is the most Welsh institutions - Aberystwyth, Bangor, Lampeter - that are the most dependent. And it is easy for students - and staff - to travel in the other direction. From South Wales it is quicker to get to London than the north of the principality, where Liverpool and Manchester are in easy reach. Professor Phil Gummett, the new director of higher education for the Welsh funding council, points out that most academics could take a job at an English university without moving house. How would the assembly - and Welsh academia - react to the idea that their future is so bound up with England that the eventual outcome will be a northern consortium linked to Manchester and/or Liverpool and perhaps two or three institutions in south Wales tied to Bath or Bristol? That is the prediction of one highly placed insider in the Welsh establishment, who says: \"I don't think the Welsh higher education system is big enough to cope.\" Prudently, he remains anonymous.

      "body": "<p>Tomorrow students will gather in London for the National Union of Students' latest attempt to bottle that old-fashioned spirit, student protest, and send it out to galvanise the pre-election campaign against tuition fees. </p> <p>This, the \"biggest ever\" demonstration against tuition fees, is the best chance president Owain James - with London mayor Ken Livingstone in tow - will ever have to inspire the confidence of his members. But the union's grand online strategy, which was meant to bring students out on the streets of Kennington, has fallen flat. </p> <p>It started so promisingly. At the beginning of September, the NUS announced an \"online revolution\" for their members which would, Owain James promised, reach out to every student in the country. Lured by bargains and online discounts, they would see an NUS that was a long way from the braying, disunited politicking of campus elections; a union that saved them money and campaigned on their behalf. </p> <p>Most student union websites had already thrown up a site of their own. Some were sophisticated efforts; others were just a page with a few contacts. Many used the JANET network, and depended on their university for webspace and email facilities. The NUS spotted an opportunity. And in June, a 30-year deal was signed with ITM Activate which would offer all unions free hosting, email, software and an e-commerce service. </p> <p>\"Major partners\" in the revolution - Abbey National, Studentmobiles, Microsoft and, of course, Activate.co.uk, a jobs site owned by ITM - were signed up. Individual unions were urged to join in with the promise of \u00a3500 worth of computer equipment and a guaranteed income. </p> <p>If 30 years strikes you as a long time in the internet's future, you're not alone. \"The length of the deal was a strong reason not to join,\" says Alistair Thompson, the president of Portsmouth SU, which has signed a deal with Virginstudent.com instead. \"We were told that big universities might not get [the computer equipment at all],\" explains Thompson, \"and I was concerned about our own student database.\" </p> <p>Do Portsmouth students even know about tomorrow's demonstration? Certainly not from their own <a href=\"http://www.upsu.net\">website</a>, which no longer even links to NUS Online. </p> <p>By August, ITM Activate had announced that it intended to float on the stock market.

      "bodyText": "Tomorrow students will gather in London for the National Union of Students' latest attempt to bottle that old-fashioned spirit, student protest, and send it out to galvanise the pre-election campaign against tuition fees. This, the \"biggest ever\" demonstration against tuition fees, is the best chance president Owain James - with London mayor Ken Livingstone in tow - will ever have to inspire the confidence of his members. But the union's grand online strategy, which was meant to bring students out on the streets of Kennington, has fallen flat. It started so promisingly. At the beginning of September, the NUS announced an \"online revolution\" for their members which would, Owain James promised, reach out to every student in the country. Lured by bargains and online discounts, they would see an NUS that was a long way from the braying, disunited politicking of campus elections; a union that saved them money and campaigned on their behalf. Most student union websites had already thrown up a site of their own. Some were sophisticated efforts; others were just a page with a few contacts. Many used the JANET network, and depended on their university for webspace and email facilities. The NUS spotted an opportunity. And in June, a 30-year deal was signed with ITM Activate which would offer all unions free hosting, email, software and an e-commerce service. \"Major partners\" in the revolution - Abbey National, Studentmobiles, Microsoft and, of course, Activate.co.uk, a jobs site owned by ITM - were signed up. Individual unions were urged to join in with the promise of \u00a3500 worth of computer equipment and a guaranteed income. If 30 years strikes you as a long time in the internet's future, you're not alone. \"The length of the deal was a strong reason not to join,\" says Alistair Thompson, the president of Portsmouth SU, which has signed a deal with Virginstudent.com instead. \"We were told that big universities might not get [the computer equipment at all],\" explains Thompson, \"and I was concerned about our own student database.\" Do Portsmouth students even know about tomorrow's demonstration? Certainly not from their own website, which no longer even links to NUS Online. By August, ITM Activate had announced that it intended to float on the stock market. With a 2.5% stake in the company and the chance of an other 2.5% if the site performed well, the NUS stood to make up to \u00a350m - unheard-of riches for the union. Three months ago ITM was valued at up to \u00a310bn by City analysts. \"We're not trying to get money out of it,\" insists James. \"If we ever did make any money from it, the SUS would vote on it.

It could be that the formation of her Adult Basic Skills Strategy Unit marks the point at which Britain at last provides the necessary resources and new thinking. Yet doubts persist. Could we, even now, fail to make the necessary leap of the imagination? </p> <p>For 25 years, people like Alan Tuckett of the adult learners' organisation, Niace, and Alan Wells of the Basic Skills Agency have campaigned to get something serious done about adult basic skills. They have kept it on the public agenda, but, as Tuckett puts it, \"never quite high enough.\" </p> <p>Basic skills are central to social policy, he says. Poor numeracy, for example, has a very high correlation with crime, because an innumerate person cannot plan, is prey to loan sharks, and can easily turn to crime. More than two thirds of prisoners have poor numeracy. We have more adults with basic skills needs than any country in Europe except for Ireland and Poland. One adult in five is unable to cope with everyday tasks such as consulting a telephone directory. </p> <p>In the 1980s, the Manpower Services Commission started running 36-week courses, but then these were cut to 13 weeks, which is not enough for those with the most serious problems. Will things be better this time? There are plenty of good auguries. The Moser report concentrated minds wonderfully, and basic skills are one area in which the government seems willing to find enough money. </p> <p>Pember herself is generally well thought of. The 45-year-old principal of Canterbury College has an OBE for service to further education, and understands that basic skills are essentially a job for government. You can't shuffle it off onto local authorities, or suppose that the private sector will ride to the rescue, as the government is inclined to do with schools. You need to make the Whitehall connections that link what the education department does with what, say, the Home Office does with prisons. Employers see it as the job of the state to provide their staff with basic skills. </p> <p>Pember was a successful college principal, and has worked for local government as well as in colleges, so she understands how the machine works. It was while working for Enfield Council in the 1980s that she first became interested in basic skills, because it was her job to find out what industry and employers wanted from further education. She saw that people without good key skills were destined for the scrapheap. </p> <p>She is, of course, uncomfortably close to New Labour. That might be seen as an advantage in a job where nothing can be achieved without the commitment of ministers. But this closeness, combined with the fact that she is not a traditional basic skills expert, has fuelled fears that even now the government is not ready to think the radical thoughts that the experts say need to be thought. </p> <p>\"They say the strategy will be radical,\" says Alan Wells. \"I hope it will. My fear is that it will be too traditional.\" He worries that policy-makers' vision is still bound by college-based courses. \"How do you motivate the 7m people with poor basic skills? Some of them will come into colleges. But there is no evidence that the majority will do that. People think there's an audience out there, and all you have to do is give them a bit of childcare and they will come in. They won't.\" </p> <p>In Ireland, he says, they advertised a self-help pack on television; and in Britain, a survey has shown that more than half of those with poor basic skills want to learn in their own home. A few years ago the Basic Skills Agency gave a literacy pack out via the BBC. And why not make packs available through supermarkets? </p> <p>There's some evidence that policy-makers' thinking is still college-bound. Pember herself talks a lot about teaching. She wants to see basics skills teaching being accredited by a university, to ensure that \"if learners move from one provider to another, they will feel at home - the learning materials will be the same.\" She wants to see a common training for basics skills teachers. She talks of ensuring that efforts to tackle basic skills are co-ordinated across the country and across government - her basic skills unit at Canterbury had to bid for money from up to 15 sources. It's all excellent, but hardly radical. </p> <p>Unlike Wells, she has not been steeped in basic skills thinking for years. That could be an advantage, according to Steve Broomfield, the chief executive of Warrington Council and a former further education college principal who, as a government adviser, has been a kind of godfather to Pember's strategy unit. He says: \"She is not a basic skills expert, but that is a good thing. She's new, she'll bring fresh ideas to it.\" </p> <p>Pember herself points out that she first trained as a primary school teacher, so she ought to know something about teaching basic skills. She fully expected to spend her career in primary schools. Like most of her generation she knew practically nothing about colleges. But, fatefully, she applied for a job at Redbridge Technical College for interview experience. The moment she stepped inside, she knew that colleges were the place she wanted to work in. \"You saw you could make a difference to these people's lives,\" she says. Many of her students had basic skills needs. </p> <p>If enthusiasm were enough, she would be home and dry already. \"I'm very optimistic - I think an excellent strategy will come out of this, better than anywhere else in the world.

      "body": "<p>The British empire left much of the developing world a legacy of universities teaching through the medium of English. Not surprisingly, many of their students look to Europe for their postgraduate qualifications, particularly for the masters degrees in science and engineering that give access to globally recognised professional qualifications. But increasingly it is continental, and especially German, universities which are attracting students who might previously have come to the United Kingdom. Why is this happening? </p> <p>Eighteen months ago, the higher education ministers from 29 European countries met in Bologna and signed a declaration setting out objectives for the development of European higher education. In the United Kingdom the declaration was noticed little, and understood less. Among its concrete proposals, the one which attracted most attention was the intention to replace seven- or eight-year continental courses with two cycles of qualification based on bachelors and masters degrees. </p> <p>To view this, complacently, as the rest of Europe lining up with the UK would be a grave mistake. A prime objective of the Bologna declaration is to promote the international competitiveness of the European higher education system. To do this it was necessary to adopt the structure of degrees that is commonly recognised throughout the world. That objective is being pursued with alacrity: in Germany there are already 400 pilots of the bachelors/masters structure. </p> <p>Adoption of a familiar structure of qualifications is not enough to become competitive. Increasingly, English is to higher education what Microsoft is to computing. Like it or not, it is becoming the universal language. And that is why, as the Germans pilot their new, post-Bologna qualifications, they will teach many of them in English. </p> <p>The UK's natural advantages in the overseas student market are being whittled away. The advantages of historical links are not what they were. The generation now in power in many developing countries is the generation that was the first to suffer from the sharp increase in overseas student fees that Britain imposed 30 years ago. The UK cannot compete on price, as fees charged to overseas students remain amongst the highest in Europe. And now the advantage of the English language is diminished, as universities across Europe provide teaching in English. </p> <p>But the reputation and standing of UK higher education should not rest on accidents of history, price, or convenience of a common language. UK higher education will stand or fall on academic standards. </p> <p>In 1997 the Dearing Report called for \"greater explicitness and clarity about standards and the levels of achievement required for different awards\". Dearing was addressing the concerns of employers who wanted to know what they could expect from candidates for jobs. To illustrate his point, he cited the confusion that arose from five different usages of the qualification \"masters\". Today, it is not just UK employers who want to know what degrees stand for, it is would-be students from around the world. </p> <p>Calibrating standards across subjects and between countries may seem daunting. But regardless of discipline or location, all higher education has one thing in common. It is concerned with exploration and discovery at the boundaries of our knowledge and understanding. Through grappling with complex subject matter, and difficult concepts, students learn to order and explain information, to define and to solve problems. Teaching that is informed by the fresh insights that come from research and development helps provide students with an appreciation of the uncertainty, ambiguity and limits of knowledge.

      "bodyText": "The British empire left much of the developing world a legacy of universities teaching through the medium of English. Not surprisingly, many of their students look to Europe for their postgraduate qualifications, particularly for the masters degrees in science and engineering that give access to globally recognised professional qualifications. But increasingly it is continental, and especially German, universities which are attracting students who might previously have come to the United Kingdom. Why is this happening? Eighteen months ago, the higher education ministers from 29 European countries met in Bologna and signed a declaration setting out objectives for the development of European higher education. In the United Kingdom the declaration was noticed little, and understood less. Among its concrete proposals, the one which attracted most attention was the intention to replace seven- or eight-year continental courses with two cycles of qualification based on bachelors and masters degrees. To view this, complacently, as the rest of Europe lining up with the UK would be a grave mistake. A prime objective of the Bologna declaration is to promote the international competitiveness of the European higher education system. To do this it was necessary to adopt the structure of degrees that is commonly recognised throughout the world. That objective is being pursued with alacrity: in Germany there are already 400 pilots of the bachelors/masters structure. Adoption of a familiar structure of qualifications is not enough to become competitive. Increasingly, English is to higher education what Microsoft is to computing. Like it or not, it is becoming the universal language. And that is why, as the Germans pilot their new, post-Bologna qualifications, they will teach many of them in English. The UK's natural advantages in the overseas student market are being whittled away. The advantages of historical links are not what they were. The generation now in power in many developing countries is the generation that was the first to suffer from the sharp increase in overseas student fees that Britain imposed 30 years ago. The UK cannot compete on price, as fees charged to overseas students remain amongst the highest in Europe. And now the advantage of the English language is diminished, as universities across Europe provide teaching in English. But the reputation and standing of UK higher education should not rest on accidents of history, price, or convenience of a common language. UK higher education will stand or fall on academic standards. In 1997 the Dearing Report called for \"greater explicitness and clarity about standards and the levels of achievement required for different awards\". Dearing was addressing the concerns of employers who wanted to know what they could expect from candidates for jobs. To illustrate his point, he cited the confusion that arose from five different usages of the qualification \"masters\". Today, it is not just UK employers who want to know what degrees stand for, it is would-be students from around the world. Calibrating standards across subjects and between countries may seem daunting. But regardless of discipline or location, all higher education has one thing in common. It is concerned with exploration and discovery at the boundaries of our knowledge and understanding. Through grappling with complex subject matter, and difficult concepts, students learn to order and explain information, to define and to solve problems. Teaching that is informed by the fresh insights that come from research and development helps provide students with an appreciation of the uncertainty, ambiguity and limits of knowledge. Learning to make sound judgements in complex, unpredictable contexts is a key intellectual skill. Knowledge itself knows no national boundaries, so its own boundary provides a common, global point of reference for the calibration of degree standards. Proximity to that boundary is the reference point proposed by the Quality Assurance Agency for determining the stan dards of UK degrees. The Qualifications Framework for Higher Education, launched today, sets out expectations for degrees at all levels. An honours degree is expected to address the mastery of knowledge, understanding and ideas at the forefront of an academic discipline; and the problem-solving and communication skills that should be developed by study at that level. The expectations of masters degrees will challenge universities to show that they are awarding the title for advanced study requiring a critical awareness of current academic problems, and the ability to advance new hypotheses. Use of the title for conversion courses teaching undergraduate material should stop. In making clear the achievements represented by the main degree titles, and the attributes and abilities that holders of those degrees possess, the UK is leading the world in developing a new explicitness about academic standards. That will ensure that in the new European common market of qualifications, established by the Bologna Declaration, it is UK standards that set the pace. And it is those standards, not the accidents of history or language, that will maintain the UK's pre-eminent role in the global market for overseas students. \u0095 John Randall is chief executive, Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>After months of direct action, blockading building societies and post office counters, further education students finally forced the government to back down last week in the row over personal savings. As the chastened Chancellor, Gordon Brown, announced that the age limit for tax-free individual savings accounts (ISAs) was to be reduced from 18 to 16, students welcomed the news that they would no longer be crippled by the upper bracket 40% tax rate or forced to only attend day-release courses from their Cayman Island havens for fear of contravening tax-exemption laws. </p> <p>Well, that's the story we would like to have run. In fact, the news that Gordon's twin pillars of thrift and prudence are to be extended to the tune of a tax-free \u00a33,000 per annum to 16-year olds, either at work or at school, has been greeted with almost total indifference, except for concerns for the Chancellor's mental health. </p> <p>Very few studies have been conducted into the savings habits of young people. As banks and building societies generally like to know as much as possible about the public's financial routines, one can only assume this is not an oversight but an indication that there is nothing much to report. </p> <p>Most 16-year-olds in full-time work are likely to be earning around \u00a38,000 per year; after deductions for tax, national insurance, rent and living expenses there's not going to be much to save. For students, the picture is bleaker still. Further education students may get a massive \u00a3150 individual learning allowance, and some might be lucky enough, depending on their parents' income, to qualify for between \u00a35 and \u00a330 per week under the newly piloted Educational Maintenance Allowance. How much of that are they expected to save? Not much, if the Further Education Development Agency's own research into student hardship is anything to go by. This suggests that 65% of 19-year-olds on full-time courses work at least 10 hours just to keep their head above water. </p> <p>The National Union of Students is clearly sceptical but is anxious to impart a diplomatic spin. \"We obviously support any measures that encourage savings,\" says Mark Atkinson, NUS chief executive representative for further education. But who is it aimed at? \"Perhaps it's a government admission of the widening gulf between student incomes and expenditure,\" he continues. \"Maybe by encouraging 16- and 17-year-olds to save, they hope they will have fewer financial difficulties in post-18 education.\" </p> <p>This has a logic, albeit a somewhat tortured one. But it might still not be quite what Gordon Brown had in mind. For that, one has to ask the financial experts. \"It's basically a means to allow the better-off to save more money,\" says one, who prefers to remain anonymous. \"Well-off parents can now put away extra cash in a child's name at 16 rather than 18. In theory, this money is being saved on behalf of the child, but this is not set in stone as the child could always be asked to give it back.\" So it's just another scam, then? \"You said it, not me,\" he mutters, before downing another glass of champagne.</p>",

      "bodyText": "After months of direct action, blockading building societies and post office counters, further education students finally forced the government to back down last week in the row over personal savings. As the chastened Chancellor, Gordon Brown, announced that the age limit for tax-free individual savings accounts (ISAs) was to be reduced from 18 to 16, students welcomed the news that they would no longer be crippled by the upper bracket 40% tax rate or forced to only attend day-release courses from their Cayman Island havens for fear of contravening tax-exemption laws. Well, that's the story we would like to have run. In fact, the news that Gordon's twin pillars of thrift and prudence are to be extended to the tune of a tax-free \u00a33,000 per annum to 16-year olds, either at work or at school, has been greeted with almost total indifference, except for concerns for the Chancellor's mental health. Very few studies have been conducted into the savings habits of young people. As banks and building societies generally like to know as much as possible about the public's financial routines, one can only assume this is not an oversight but an indication that there is nothing much to report. Most 16-year-olds in full-time work are likely to be earning around \u00a38,000 per year; after deductions for tax, national insurance, rent and living expenses there's not going to be much to save. For students, the picture is bleaker still. Further education students may get a massive \u00a3150 individual learning allowance, and some might be lucky enough, depending on their parents' income, to qualify for between \u00a35 and \u00a330 per week under the newly piloted Educational Maintenance Allowance. How much of that are they expected to save? Not much, if the Further Education Development Agency's own research into student hardship is anything to go by. This suggests that 65% of 19-year-olds on full-time courses work at least 10 hours just to keep their head above water. The National Union of Students is clearly sceptical but is anxious to impart a diplomatic spin. \"We obviously support any measures that encourage savings,\" says Mark Atkinson, NUS chief executive representative for further education. But who is it aimed at? \"Perhaps it's a government admission of the widening gulf between student incomes and expenditure,\" he continues. \"Maybe by encouraging 16- and 17-year-olds to save, they hope they will have fewer financial difficulties in post-18 education.\" This has a logic, albeit a somewhat tortured one. But it might still not be quite what Gordon Brown had in mind. For that, one has to ask the financial experts. \"It's basically a means to allow the better-off to save more money,\" says one, who prefers to remain anonymous. \"Well-off parents can now put away extra cash in a child's name at 16 rather than 18. In theory, this money is being saved on behalf of the child, but this is not set in stone as the child could always be asked to give it back.\" So it's just another scam, then? \"You said it, not me,\" he mutters, before downing another glass of champagne.",

      "body": "<p>Celeste Morton has been told her mother Gracia is dead. She doesn't know how it happened, or why, and so far, she hasn't wanted - or perhaps dared - to ask. For the moment, the difficult questions which she must have are locked inside the private world of this bright, otherwise inquisitive, seven-year-old girl. In some ways, it is a relief for those who care for her.</p> <p>Because nobody, including her father Jonathan, her aunt Constanza Lezama, and one of Scotland Yard's most scrupulous detectives, Hamish Campbell - can tell her the answers she will one day want to know.</p> <p>Three years ago last Sunday, Gracia Morton, then 40, disappeared without trace. She dropped Celeste at nursery school in Holland Park, west London, and was due to meet her brother-in-law, Peter Thomas, at the Barbican, where he was performing with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. She never arrived.</p> <p>The police deal with reports of missing people all the time, but this case was particularly unusual. Gracia, an Argentinian musician who moved to the UK in 1985, was not a difficult or troubled woman. She was in fine spirits. No money had been taken from her bank account, and her flat in Kensington was exactly as she left it. Her passport was among her belongings at home. Her luggage and clothes were untouched.</p> <p>Could Gracia abandon her daughter suddenly and without warning? Preposterous, her family said. Detectives dismissed the idea too. She adored Celeste.</p> <p>Gracia left one confusing clue. After kissing her daughter goodbye, she popped in to see her estranged husband, Jonathan, who owns a house in nearby St Ann's Road, Holland Park. They had been separated for 10 months. The 62-year-old architect told detectives she had asked him to fetch their daughter later that day and keep her overnight. She also asked him to look after her Rover car and gave him the keys to the vehicle and her flat. She did not tell him where she was going or what she intended to do. After this, the trail goes cold.</p> <p>There have been no sightings of Gracia since then. There has been no contact of any kind. Her savings remain untouched. To begin with, her older sister Constanza, 45, an interpreter who lives in Oxfordshire, hoped Gracia would call or write to explain, but the more she thought about it, the gloomier she became. Gracia was punctilious, straightforward and reliable.</p> <p>Constanza now assumes her younger sister was attacked and killed, but because her body has not been found, she says she has been grieving a \"non-death\". The intense pain she and her family felt when Gracia first vanished has been replaced by a desperate aching to understand what happened.</p> <p>\"It is hard to move on,\" says Constanza. \"Above all, I am sad because I miss my sister so much. I can't even talk about that without crying, especially at a time like this.</p> <p>\"And I am livid. Livid that something like this could happen with apparent impunity. That somebody has killed my sister and left us nothing. That someone has done something terrible and got away with it.\"</p> <p>Constanza spent the third anniversary of Gracia's disappearance with her other sister, Maria, the youngest of the three. The sis- ters were very close and chatted most days.</p> <p>The last time Constanza spoke to Gracia - 24 hours before she disappeared - they gossiped about their family and teased each other about Christmas. \"I remember the conversation so well. She loved Christmas and I hated it. She was trying to soften me up, telling me all the things we could do that would make it more bearable. We had a gossip about the family, as we always did. She was very relaxed. Her life was full of projects and she was enjoying her job.</p> <p>\"She had had a difficult time with the separation, but that was behind her and she was looking forward. She was a positive woman. There was absolutely nothing to make me think something was wrong. It is strange how conversations like this have become landmarks in my life,\" she adds. \"Keeping the memories alive are terribly important to us all.\"</p> <p>Constanza's prime concern is Celeste, who is living with her father. \"She will tell you, 'Mummy is dead', but she does not talk about what has happened in any proper sense.

      "bodyText": "Celeste Morton has been told her mother Gracia is dead. She doesn't know how it happened, or why, and so far, she hasn't wanted - or perhaps dared - to ask. For the moment, the difficult questions which she must have are locked inside the private world of this bright, otherwise inquisitive, seven-year-old girl. In some ways, it is a relief for those who care for her. Because nobody, including her father Jonathan, her aunt Constanza Lezama, and one of Scotland Yard's most scrupulous detectives, Hamish Campbell - can tell her the answers she will one day want to know. Three years ago last Sunday, Gracia Morton, then 40, disappeared without trace. She dropped Celeste at nursery school in Holland Park, west London, and was due to meet her brother-in-law, Peter Thomas, at the Barbican, where he was performing with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. She never arrived. The police deal with reports of missing people all the time, but this case was particularly unusual. Gracia, an Argentinian musician who moved to the UK in 1985, was not a difficult or troubled woman. She was in fine spirits. No money had been taken from her bank account, and her flat in Kensington was exactly as she left it. Her passport was among her belongings at home. Her luggage and clothes were untouched. Could Gracia abandon her daughter suddenly and without warning? Preposterous, her family said. Detectives dismissed the idea too. She adored Celeste. Gracia left one confusing clue. After kissing her daughter goodbye, she popped in to see her estranged husband, Jonathan, who owns a house in nearby St Ann's Road, Holland Park. They had been separated for 10 months. The 62-year-old architect told detectives she had asked him to fetch their daughter later that day and keep her overnight. She also asked him to look after her Rover car and gave him the keys to the vehicle and her flat. She did not tell him where she was going or what she intended to do. After this, the trail goes cold. There have been no sightings of Gracia since then. There has been no contact of any kind. Her savings remain untouched. To begin with, her older sister Constanza, 45, an interpreter who lives in Oxfordshire, hoped Gracia would call or write to explain, but the more she thought about it, the gloomier she became. Gracia was punctilious, straightforward and reliable. Constanza now assumes her younger sister was attacked and killed, but because her body has not been found, she says she has been grieving a \"non-death\". The intense pain she and her family felt when Gracia first vanished has been replaced by a desperate aching to understand what happened. \"It is hard to move on,\" says Constanza. \"Above all, I am sad because I miss my sister so much. I can't even talk about that without crying, especially at a time like this. \"And I am livid. Livid that something like this could happen with apparent impunity. That somebody has killed my sister and left us nothing. That someone has done something terrible and got away with it.\" Constanza spent the third anniversary of Gracia's disappearance with her other sister, Maria, the youngest of the three. The sis- ters were very close and chatted most days. The last time Constanza spoke to Gracia - 24 hours before she disappeared - they gossiped about their family and teased each other about Christmas. \"I remember the conversation so well. She loved Christmas and I hated it. She was trying to soften me up, telling me all the things we could do that would make it more bearable. We had a gossip about the family, as we always did. She was very relaxed. Her life was full of projects and she was enjoying her job. \"She had had a difficult time with the separation, but that was behind her and she was looking forward. She was a positive woman. There was absolutely nothing to make me think something was wrong. It is strange how conversations like this have become landmarks in my life,\" she adds. \"Keeping the memories alive are terribly important to us all.\" Constanza's prime concern is Celeste, who is living with her father. \"She will tell you, 'Mummy is dead', but she does not talk about what has happened in any proper sense. She does not know and she does not ask. There are certain things she will talk about, safe areas. She will recognise a pair of earrings and say, 'They were mummy's.' But when I ask her if she misses her mother, she clams up.\" Constanza believes Celeste is blocking off hurtful thoughts, and she is fearful of the psychological damage that may have been done over the last three years. \"I think we need to take professional advice on how to explain a disappearance like this to a little girl. I hope that I am wrong, but I worry there are things being stored up inside that need to be let out.\" Although they have given up hope that Gracia is alive, the sisters will continue to look for her. Constanza's husband, Peter, has been working with a forensic archaeologist to identify possible areas where Gracia's body may have been buried. They are still quietly confident that the police inquiry will eventually uncover a vital clue. \"I don't believe in the idea of a perfect murder,\" says Constanza.\"I am heartened that the police have not given up hope.

Pledges from all 15 EU member countries for the proposed new European rapid reaction force are due to be made in Brussels next week at an unprecedented meeting of foreign and defence ministers.

Responding to Tory claims, the officials insisted there was no question of setting up a \"European army\". The joint force would not even be a standing army, they said.

Mr Ball, 53, who lives in Cornwall, co-founded the project in 1994 with Tim Smit, the former music producer responsible for restoring Cornwall's Lost Gardens of Heligan. The project, which secured more than \u00a337m of millennium commission funding in 1997, is not due to open to the public until spring. However, it has already attracted 450,000 visitors who have been able to watch the transformation of the site. At the heart of the project are two giant biomes or indoor greenhouses, where planting is under way - to include Amazonian, African and Asian plants like cocoa trees, vanilla orchids and bamboo. The aim is to illustrate mankind's dependence on plants. The writ, details of which emerged yesterday, shows Mr Ball was locked in a wrangle with Eden over payments before his sacking and had raised concerns with the board, the trustees and the millennium commission about alleged mismanagement. According to the writ the commission had instructed accountants KPMG to investigate Mr Ball's complaints in June last year, but refused to show him the report. A spokeswoman for the commission said KPMG had investigated but found \"nothing of substance\". She added: \"We informed Mr Ball about this in March this year. The report is internal and confidential. The commission cannot comment on the action.\" The writ says that because of the actions of Eden's directors, Mr Ball is no longer able to have an ongoing interest in Eden; he is therefore seeking compensation for his investment of time and expenses, for the benefits he expected from the project, and for his intellectual property rights. Mr Ball also seeks an injunction that Eden acknowledges him in all publications as the project's co-founder and originator.",

      "trailText": "But Cook's big splash is a bit overwritten",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A brace of speeches yesterday by Tony Blair and Robin Cook in which they sought to remind the British public of the benefits of European Union membership was remarkable in several respects.</p> <p>One is that such boosterism is deemed to be necessary at all. The truth of the prime minister's assertion that \"to cut ourselves off from the major strategic alliance on our doorstep would be a supreme act of folly\" should be obvious to all. The foreign secretary's list of reasons for valuing our common European home - three million jobs, open and expanding markets, greater national security, enhanced global influence - should be equally self-evident and convincing.</p> <p>That such statements do in fact need to be made, 27 years after Britain acceded to the Treaty of Rome, amounts to a grudging recognition of the corrosive, growing influence of euroscepticism, within and beyond the Tory party.</p> <p>Only a few months ago, a reluctant Mr Blair was being urged to make the case for joining the euro. Now, after the Danish referendum and his own remarks in Seoul, the single currency is well and truly off Labour's pre-election agenda (although not William Hague's). Instead, more basic questions about EU membership have come into play. For that reason, the government's pro-Europe PR offensive is as welcome as it is overdue.</p> <p>If Labour is being forced to fight old battles, it must shoulder part of the blame. It has allowed Mr Hague to gain the initiative over the euro: significantly, the first of the \"five commitments\" of his election battleplan is Keep the Pound. This obsessive Tory emphasis encourages a broader europhobia. Labour became embroiled in a furious row over France's refusal to lift the beef ban, for example, but watched helplessly as the EC failed to force Paris to back down.</p> <p>For the lay voter, fairly or unfairly, this episode seriously undermined Labour's claims to wield greater influence within Europe. Labour supports a common EU foreign and defence policy but fails to explain exactly how such projects serve Britain's interests in its relations with the US or Nato or, say, in Sierra Leone.</p> <p>Mr Cook blames sections of the British media for peddling \"euro-myths\". His claim that some press reporting is biased against Brussels and thus disinforms the British public is certainly justified. His contention that \"it is patriotism, it is national self-interest, to argue for Britain's full engagement as a leading partner in Europe\" and that it is a self-defeating \"betrayal\" constantly to obstruct and criticise efforts at enhanced cooperation, while a trifle overwrought, is one we support. But it is plain daft to suggest there are not serious problems concerning the EU's aspirations, institutions and lack of democracy that require continuous, rigorous media examination.</p> <p>In describing next month's Nice summit as unadulterated \"good news\", Mr Cook lurches towards the very kind of misleading exaggeration he deplores in Britain's press. He also commits the cardinal journalistic error of underestimating his audience. Nice will present difficult choices for Britain, for example on the surrender of the national veto in many areas. People know this. And they know the Tories will exploit it.</p> <p>It is unclear whether Nice will deliver other measures needed to facilitate enlargement; or whether France and Germany will again embarrass Britain with their federalising ideas and plans for a two-speed community. Speaking up for the EU and for Britain's membership is vitally important. But that should not mean pretending that everything in the Brussels garden is blooming.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A brace of speeches yesterday by Tony Blair and Robin Cook in which they sought to remind the British public of the benefits of European Union membership was remarkable in several respects. One is that such boosterism is deemed to be necessary at all. The truth of the prime minister's assertion that \"to cut ourselves off from the major strategic alliance on our doorstep would be a supreme act of folly\" should be obvious to all. The foreign secretary's list of reasons for valuing our common European home - three million jobs, open and expanding markets, greater national security, enhanced global influence - should be equally self-evident and convincing. That such statements do in fact need to be made, 27 years after Britain acceded to the Treaty of Rome, amounts to a grudging recognition of the corrosive, growing influence of euroscepticism, within and beyond the Tory party. Only a few months ago, a reluctant Mr Blair was being urged to make the case for joining the euro. Now, after the Danish referendum and his own remarks in Seoul, the single currency is well and truly off Labour's pre-election agenda (although not William Hague's). Instead, more basic questions about EU membership have come into play. For that reason, the government's pro-Europe PR offensive is as welcome as it is overdue. If Labour is being forced to fight old battles, it must shoulder part of the blame. It has allowed Mr Hague to gain the initiative over the euro: significantly, the first of the \"five commitments\" of his election battleplan is Keep the Pound. This obsessive Tory emphasis encourages a broader europhobia. Labour became embroiled in a furious row over France's refusal to lift the beef ban, for example, but watched helplessly as the EC failed to force Paris to back down. For the lay voter, fairly or unfairly, this episode seriously undermined Labour's claims to wield greater influence within Europe. Labour supports a common EU foreign and defence policy but fails to explain exactly how such projects serve Britain's interests in its relations with the US or Nato or, say, in Sierra Leone. Mr Cook blames sections of the British media for peddling \"euro-myths\". His claim that some press reporting is biased against Brussels and thus disinforms the British public is certainly justified. His contention that \"it is patriotism, it is national self-interest, to argue for Britain's full engagement as a leading partner in Europe\" and that it is a self-defeating \"betrayal\" constantly to obstruct and criticise efforts at enhanced cooperation, while a trifle overwrought, is one we support. But it is plain daft to suggest there are not serious problems concerning the EU's aspirations, institutions and lack of democracy that require continuous, rigorous media examination. In describing next month's Nice summit as unadulterated \"good news\", Mr Cook lurches towards the very kind of misleading exaggeration he deplores in Britain's press. He also commits the cardinal journalistic error of underestimating his audience. Nice will present difficult choices for Britain, for example on the surrender of the national veto in many areas. People know this. And they know the Tories will exploit it. It is unclear whether Nice will deliver other measures needed to facilitate enlargement; or whether France and Germany will again embarrass Britain with their federalising ideas and plans for a two-speed community. Speaking up for the EU and for Britain's membership is vitally important. But that should not mean pretending that everything in the Brussels garden is blooming.",

It's very hard because I love Middlesbrough.\" </p> <p>\"As far as I am concerned, if he doesn't want to play for the club then his request is granted,\" said Robson. </p> <p>The Scotland defender Brian O'Neil yesterday joined Derby in a swap deal which saw Stefan Schnoor return to Germany with Wolfsburg.

      "bodyText": "Birmingham City's co-owner David Sullivan may raise his stake in Tottenham - but only for business reasons. \"Spurs are a company I believe are underpriced and undervalued,\" said Sullivan, who already owns a 1% stake in the club. \"I may raise my stake to 9.9% but I won't be going any higher until I've done my job at Birmingham.\" That job is guiding the Midlands club to the Premiership, after which he plans to sell up and become involved elsewhere, either at Cardiff City, his home-town club, or nearer his Essex base. The Middlesbrough manager Bryan Robson has transfer-listed his Italian defender Gianluca Festa at the player's request. The 31-year-old, signed from Internazionale for \u00a32.7m in 1997, has been out of the side in recent weeks and, with the \u00a38m defender Ugo Ehiogu back in training after a calf injury, asked Robson for a move. \"I have asked to leave because I am not playing but I believe that I deserve to,\" said Festa. \"I can accept being on the bench if the team is doing well, but we are not. It's very hard because I love Middlesbrough.\" \"As far as I am concerned, if he doesn't want to play for the club then his request is granted,\" said Robson. The Scotland defender Brian O'Neil yesterday joined Derby in a swap deal which saw Stefan Schnoor return to Germany with Wolfsburg. O'Neil has signed a 2-year contract and is expected to make his debut against Bradford on Saturday. Fears that the Croatian Igor Biscan's transfer to Liverpool would collapse have been lifted after the \u00a35m midfielder was granted a work permit. He will now arrive at Anfield on December 1 - two weeks earlier than originally planned. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Boutique, is not a wry tribute to George Best's 1970s clothes store but the adopted name of the Skint Records-associated Brighton club that put the tour together. Three bands (and a few DJs) alternate every night, and as for the booze, the whole shebang is sponsored by Carling, with the NME and Rizla. The beer certainly flows, much of it from full cans hurled dangerously from the stage, so we hope the sponsor's involvement extends to public liability insurance and the provision of tin hats for the crowd. If only our lovely licensing laws were as adventurous as this bill. Sadly, the Draconian restrictions ensure that hotly-tipped South are on absurdly early, before most of the audience have arrived.

He won't ever get to be as famous as Michael Brecker (he doesn't go in for saxophone aerobics, warp-speed runs, explosive climaxes), but over the course of an hour-and- a-half he delivered an astonishing succession of solos - and he got better as the show went on. </p> <p>A long, swerving tenor solo on a fast opener to the second half burst the usual boundaries of how far single improvised motifs could be extended, and Potter played a ballad of breathtaking fragility for the encore that confirmed how strong he was in the opposite dynamic direction. </p> <p>Though the improvising was of a high standard, the written materials were almost as distinctive - and coupled with the meticulous accuracy of the playing, even at extremes of the sax and double-bass registers, they were crucial to the gig's remarkable consistency.</p>",

Motian, a former partner of Keith Jarrett and the late Bill Evans, is a percussionist with an eccentrically personal signature, using space and fragmented patterns to imply rhythms as much as state them. Johnson, a regular Motian partner, is a bassist with a comparable intelligent delicacy - and Chris Potter has lately emerged as one of the most remarkable saxophone improvisers. Motian's full percussion panoply was on display on Saturday, with tickling cymbal figures followed by exclamatory slams, softly whis-pering brushwork, and brief surges of swing. But though this was a sublime group performance, it was really Potter's night. He won't ever get to be as famous as Michael Brecker (he doesn't go in for saxophone aerobics, warp-speed runs, explosive climaxes), but over the course of an hour-and- a-half he delivered an astonishing succession of solos - and he got better as the show went on. A long, swerving tenor solo on a fast opener to the second half burst the usual boundaries of how far single improvised motifs could be extended, and Potter played a ballad of breathtaking fragility for the encore that confirmed how strong he was in the opposite dynamic direction. Though the improvising was of a high standard, the written materials were almost as distinctive - and coupled with the meticulous accuracy of the playing, even at extremes of the sax and double-bass registers, they were crucial to the gig's remarkable consistency.",
