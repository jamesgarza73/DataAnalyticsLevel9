Stone, fed by Paul Merson, forced the first with a fierce right-foot shot which Weaver tipped over his crossbar. From the subsequent corner Merson found Gareth Southgate, whose far-post header looked set to break the deadlock before Weaver palmed the ball away for another corner.",

      "bodyText": "Robbie Fowler's late winner was his first goal since last December but it took extra-time to separate two closely matched sides last night in a match that bristled with commitment, making a mockery of those who take this competition lightly. All those around him may have shown the now traditional disrespect for this particular tournament by sending out young and deliberately weakened line-ups but not the Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier. The Liverpool side that took the field on a filthy, inclement night was awash with household names - even if the likes of Emile Heskey and Christian Ziege dropped down to the bench - as the good folk of Merseyside were invited to worship at the red altar for a fourth time in 12 days. The football was neat and tidy, the sweet ebb and flow cunningly disguising the fact that neither side seemed capable of creating anything of merit once over the halfway line. Indeed, until Liverpool shook the evening out of its lethargy with a lovely goal on 11 minutes the tie held all the appeal and urgency of a testimonial fixture. However, as any self-respecting manager will tell you, goals can not only change but also make games. The danger to the Chelsea goal was minimal when the ball fell to the feet of Dietmar Hamann some distance outside the penalty area. But, one flick of Hamann's right boot and the ball was delivered into the path of Danny Murphy who steered a low, precise shot inside Ed de Goey's far post. The goal hardly seemed to register on those in blue; if there was an injection of pace into Chelsea's hitherto pedestrian football it was negligible. Dennis Wise did his best to stir things up in his side's spluttering engine room but once again he had placed aggression above productivity. He's an old dog and he simply will not be taught new tricks. Even so, Chelsea were level by the half-hour, Gianfranco Zola arriving unannounced in between Sami Hyypia and Djimi Traore to head home Celestine Babayaro's cross from the right flank. A rather ungainly streaker and a chaplinesque tumble by referee Harris apart, the second half was only marginally more appealing than the first although Liverpool's football did gather momentum as the minutes ticked away. They should have moved back in front two minutes after the restart but, sadly, Robbie Fowler has been restored to health but not potency. After Vladimir Smicer's shot had been blocked, it fell nicely for Fowler but he mistimed his header from close range and found only De Goey's midrift. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink had endured one of his less productive evenings at the sharp end of the Chelsea attack but his delicious volley from 20 yards went within six inches of its intended target. The Chelsea coach Claudio Ranieri signalled his attacking intentions by sending on the Icelandic striker Eidur Gudjohnsen for Babayaro and the later introduction of Jody Morris for the young centre-back John Terry relieved the team of another natural defender. However, not even the appearance of Gustavo Poyet could stop the game sliding towards extra-time. Amid some fierce challenges, Heskey was lucky to stay on the pitch after an atrocious studs-up lunge that caught Mario Melchiot above the knee and Ziege was also fortunate that the refere did not see him elbow Morris in the face.

      "bodyText": "Leicester, leaders of the Premiership three weeks ago, were bought down to earth by First Division Crystal Palace at Filbert Street last night. Palace, whose manager Alan Smith had berated his side for their recent lack of commitment, won 3-0. Goals from Clinton Morrison, a 17th-minute header, and Steve Thomson gave them a shock 2-0 lead at the interval and the Latvian Andrejs Rubins added a third early in the second half to dump the holders out of the Worthington Cup. Leicester were attempting to reach their fourth final in five years. Fulham, whose 100% league run was ended by Wolves last month, avenged that goalless draw by beating the Midlanders 3-2, recovering from being a goal down to score through Luis Boa Morte (2) and his prolific French partner Louis Saha. Simon Osborn scored for Wolves in the final minute. At the Britannia stadium Rikhardur Dadason's last-minute goal gave Stoke a 3-2 win over Barnsley. The Icelander, a substitute, had been signed 24 hours earlier and been on the pitch for four minutes. Barnsley had twice equalised through Mateo Corbo and Lee Jones.

In the England camp this was scarcely surprising given the allegations against Alec Stewart and the possibility, for much of the day, that his tour was over. </p> <p>Stewart stayed away from the ground, as did Nasser Hussain, Darren Gough and Andy Caddick, leaving the team in the hands of Graham Thorpe, who fiddled around with his new bowling toy all day - eight used in all, including himself but, oddly, not Graeme Hick - without making much headway against the Pakistan Board Patron's XI. </p> <p>Pick of the bunch was Matthew Hoggard, who in 19 good burly overs concentrated well on the demands of the new ball on a grassy pitch - if England thought they might get a sniff of a turner on which to practise, they were sadly deluded - and some testing field placings that loaded the off-side early on and left acres of unprotected land on the leg-side, to finish with three for 33. </p> <p>Good catches were held by Hick, low to his right at second slip, and Thorpe, chest-high at third, with Craig White, whose own bowling relied too much on an ineffective bouncer, clinging on to a nifty one plunging forward at point. Hoggard, though, is down the pecking order of pace bowlers, and it was to Ian Salisbury and Ashley Giles that England were looking to produce more than a token offering of spin during the coming series. </p> <p>Giles bowled his 18 overs tidily in unhelpful conditions and collected the wicket of the Test batsman Mohammad Wasim with a nicely flighted delivery that found the outside edge as he drove vigorously. </p> <p>Salisbury, though, despite numerous pleas for lbw that went unheeded, looked unremarkable. If any tremors were to be felt from the Pakistan team then it can only have been Inzamam-ul-Haq practising his skipping, and the real comparison will come when the opposition's highly rated young spinners get their chance later in the match. </p> <p>The day's most assured batting came from the wristy young left-hander Qaisar Abbas. He came to the crease after Hoggard's new-ball stint had done for Imran Abbas and Kamran Ali, and Marcus Trescothick, bowling first-change, induced an edge from the opener Naved Ashraf, another Test batsman, as he chased a wide swinging ball. In three hours Qaisar hit nine boundaries in an unbeaten 71 as the home side reached 188 for five.</p>",

Stewart stayed away from the ground, as did Nasser Hussain, Darren Gough and Andy Caddick, leaving the team in the hands of Graham Thorpe, who fiddled around with his new bowling toy all day - eight used in all, including himself but, oddly, not Graeme Hick - without making much headway against the Pakistan Board Patron's XI. Pick of the bunch was Matthew Hoggard, who in 19 good burly overs concentrated well on the demands of the new ball on a grassy pitch - if England thought they might get a sniff of a turner on which to practise, they were sadly deluded - and some testing field placings that loaded the off-side early on and left acres of unprotected land on the leg-side, to finish with three for 33. Good catches were held by Hick, low to his right at second slip, and Thorpe, chest-high at third, with Craig White, whose own bowling relied too much on an ineffective bouncer, clinging on to a nifty one plunging forward at point. Hoggard, though, is down the pecking order of pace bowlers, and it was to Ian Salisbury and Ashley Giles that England were looking to produce more than a token offering of spin during the coming series. Giles bowled his 18 overs tidily in unhelpful conditions and collected the wicket of the Test batsman Mohammad Wasim with a nicely flighted delivery that found the outside edge as he drove vigorously. Salisbury, though, despite numerous pleas for lbw that went unheeded, looked unremarkable. If any tremors were to be felt from the Pakistan team then it can only have been Inzamam-ul-Haq practising his skipping, and the real comparison will come when the opposition's highly rated young spinners get their chance later in the match. The day's most assured batting came from the wristy young left-hander Qaisar Abbas. He came to the crease after Hoggard's new-ball stint had done for Imran Abbas and Kamran Ali, and Marcus Trescothick, bowling first-change, induced an edge from the opener Naved Ashraf, another Test batsman, as he chased a wide swinging ball. In three hours Qaisar hit nine boundaries in an unbeaten 71 as the home side reached 188 for five.",

      "body": "<p>We have all done it. At the end of a particularly irritating meeting we send off an email to our close friends at the office telling them exactly what we think of the new manager's dress sense, nasal hair growth and corporate vision. Or we come across a particularly juicy photograph of two people locked in an embrace, one of whom just happens to look like the new photocopier engineer, and email a copy to one or two select colleagues. </p> <p>It is part of the net culture in many offices. But, as 40 people fired from mobile phone company Orange in September for exchanging 'inappropriate' material over the internal email system found out, it can also get you into a lot of trouble. </p> <p>It has always been possible to monitor staff email. Now, regulations which came into force on October 24 permit your employer to read your email and monitor which websites you have been visiting. And they can use that information against you. </p> <p>The Telecommunications (Lawful Business Practice) (Interception of Communications) Regulations have been drawn up by the Department of Trade and Industry under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Act mean that employers can also listen in to and record phone calls, check who you are calling on your mobile phone and search the hard drive of your laptop, if these items are provided through work. And they can do all of this without asking or telling you they are doing it, if they think you are committing a crime or doing something 'unauthorised', like sending personal emails or booking your holiday online. </p> <p>According to e-minister Patricia Hewitt, the new rules must \"strike the right balance between protecting the privacy of individuals and enabling industry and business to get the maximum benefit from new communications technology\". They have been welcomed by employers' organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry, which believes that routine monitoring of email is both normal and acceptable. </p> <p>But for trades unions or civil liberties organisations, the main concern is the imbalance between the rights of employers and those being monitored. \"We have been calling for the regulation of surveillance for some time now,\"said John Wadham, director of human rights group Liberty, \"but these regulations do not go far enough to protect people's privacy.\" </p> <p>Yaman Akdeniz, director of online civil liberties pressure group Cyber-Rights and Cyber-Liberties, calls the regulations \"very vague\" and fears \"anything is justified under them\". Caspar Bowden, director of the Foundation for Internet Policy Research, says: \"The DTI has given bullying bosses carte blanche to pry and exploit knowledge of the private lives of employees.\" </p> <p>But, there is a general acceptance that some degree of monitoring of email and web use is legitimate. If an employee is on holiday, ill, on a delayed train or away at a conference, it is important that email is dealt with and working documents can be accessed. In these cases, says Akdeniz, employers should be obliged to tell staff what they are doing, since \"whatever policy they use it should be open and transparent to the employees\". Wadham wants employees to ensure that \"everyone knows that their communications are going to be under surveillance and under what circumstances\". </p> <p>The new regulations state clearly that only \"communications relevant to the system controller's business\" can be monitored and recorded. Yet people may send and receive emails which reveal office affairs or health problems, and these could be being read by managers and systems administrators. </p> <p>One solution is for staff to be told that personal use of the system is not allowed, although this would be hard to enforce. Wadham believes workers should be provided with guaranteed privacy in some areas, perhaps through a separate personal email account for non-work matters. Employers could also agree not to restrict staff use of web-based email, limiting their interest to communications from work email addresses. </p> <p>Even with an agreed policy, there are still problems when monitoring is secret, perhaps because an employee is suspected of criminal activity or breaking their contract. It is also highly likely that monitoring will uncover personal information which is not relevant to the job. </p> <p>Nigel Wildish, an expert in IT law at London law firm Field Fisher Waterhouse, thinks \"the issue is to what extent an employer can intercept or block employee email that is not to do with the business\". He cites the need to stop viruses or block obscene material as legitimate. </p> <p>Journalists are worried because many have confidential sources who use email from their workplaces. Milverton Wallace, organiser of the annual NetMedia conference for online journalists, has arranged a seminar on legal ways around the regulations. He says: \"Unless we can find ways of guaranteeing that our communications with sources are really confidential, we will not be able to expose wrongdoing or investigate government or business effectively.\" </p> <p>The new regulations do not address the issue of how an employer uses the information obtained. If personal data is being read then the Data Protection Act (DPA) comes into force. This requires that personal data should be obtained legally and used fairly - a provision absent from RIPA. </p> <p>The Data Protection Registrar has just published a draft code of conduct on the use of personal data in employer/ employee relationships which deals with monitoring email. It accepts that \"not all monitoring necessarily falls within the scope of the Act\", but argues that \"systems that involve the interception of personal electronic communications such as email will almost certainly be covered\". Employers would have to ensure \"monitoring operates in such a way that it does not intrude unnecessarily on employees' privacy or autonomy\". </p> <p>Phil Jones, assistant commissioner in the registrar's office, says this could mean an employer who acquires personal information by surveillance under the RIPA regulations could still be prosecuted by the DPR. \"We are saying that when there is going to be any form of monitoring of email or phone calls then the fair thing to do is to be open with individuals. There should be clear policies\", he says. </p> <p>Rod Armitage, head of legal affairs at the Confederation of British Industry, has criticised the draft code for not acknowledging the needs of employers. \"It has failed to recognise the context in which business email systems work,\" he says. However, Jones feels that the possible conflict has been rather overstated. \"The code is a draft that covers lots of employee and personnel issues\", he said, \"and interception is a minor part.\" But he admits that \"we may see legal challenges to how interception is carried out, although not to the fact of doing it\". </p> <p>Wildish says that \"the RIPA powers are wider and more helpful to employers than the Data Protection Registrar's code of practice\", and he is critical of the DTI and the DPR for \"not talking together before they launched this\". </p> <p>Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which became part of UK law on October 1, guarantees respect for private life, while Article 10 gives a right to freedom of expression. Judges are now bound to consider all legislation within the context of this act. This means that intrusive, excessive or unreasonable surveillance could be illegal, despite the RIPA regulations. </p> <p>Wildish says: \"it is difficult to see how the Human Rights Act will be interpreted. For one thing, companies have human rights too, including the right not to have viruses infect systems\". When employers do not clearly state their policies, employees will be forced to act on the basis that their email is being read and their web visits logged. </p> <p>The only hope for those concerned for civil liberties comes from Nigel Wildish, who points out that \"an employer needs a system that complies with all three acts, so the one most favourable to employees will determine how much employers can intercept\". At present that means that the Data Protection Registrar's draft code of conduct offers the best way of stopping snooping employers. We can therefore expect to see intensive lobbying of the Registrar before the code is finalised in January, as employers attempt to make it easier to monitor their staff. </p> <p><strong> What employees can do</strong><br> Perhaps the most useful thing you can do is to try to make your employers issue guidelines on how and why they will monitor email and internet use. If they refuse, assume the worst -they are reading everything. </p> <p>There are limits to how secure you can make yourself when using a work computer on a work network, simply because whoever owns the hardware and internet connection controls almost everything. They can read cached web pages, look at your mail boxes, log messages at the server, tap into the physical network, grab all data passing through the router or firewall and even log every key press and mouse click you make. </p> <p>Use your own mobile phone at work for personal calls (assuming your desk is not wired for sound) and your own laptop for all personal files or emails. You could even bring a laptop and modem into work and dial up your own ISP - although you may get into trouble for making 'personal' calls. </p> <p>The latest handheld computers or top of the range mobile phones will let you surf the web and send email - and you don't have to limit yourself to the low-tech Wap services. </p> <p>If this is not possible, stop using work computers for private email or Web surfing. Find the local cybercafe and head there at lunchtimes instead of having a sandwich at your desk. </p> <p>If you really have to be online for your friends while you are at work, think carefully about what you are doing. </p> <p>Web-based email services such as HotMail may seem secure because your messages are stored on their computers and sent over their connections, but the web pages you are looking at still have to come into (and go out of) your work network and this means they can be monitored. Since you are using the work computer and internet connection, this is even allowed under RIPA. </p> <p>You can get secure web email - Hushmail.com offers the best-known service and the British campaigning group Cyber Rights and Cyber Liberties has just set up its own Hushmail service at <a href=\"http://www.cyber-rights.net\">www.cyber-rights.net</a> This will give you private email, although the fact that you are using an encrypted mail service may attract attention. </p> <p>So you also need to use Anonymiser to hide the web pages you are visiting from any curious systems administrator. </p> <p>Unfortunately if your employers have installed keystroke logging software not even this will help as they will still be able to find out what you are typing. </p> <p>And if MI5 or the police want to monitor your activities in cyberspace, you stand very little chance of keeping things from them unless you invest significant time and effort in it. </p> <p>Posting hand-written letters may be your only option. </p> <p><strong> See also...</strong><br> </p> <p>For the DTI's Lawful Business Practice Regulations <br> <a href=\"http://www.dti.gov.uk/cii/lbpresponse.htm\">www.dti.gov.uk/cii</a> </p> <p> For secure web-based email<br> <a href=\"http://www.cyber-rights.net\">www.cyber-rights.net</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk\">www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.cbi.org.uk\">www.cbi.org.uk</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.anonymiser.com\">www.anonymiser.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://freenet.sourceforge.net\" target=\"_new\">http://freenet.sourceforge.net</a> </p> <p>For online privacy advice <br> <a href=\"http://www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm\">www.hmso.gov.uk/acts/acts1998/19980042.htm</a> </p> <p>For the Human Rights Act <br> <a href=\"http://www.ffwlaw.com\">www.ffwlaw.com</a> </p> <p>For Orange sackings story <br> Orange sacks staff for net porn - reported at <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/2000/34/ns-17649.html\">www.zdnet.co.uk/news/2000/34/ns-17649.html</a> </p> <p> Living with the RIP Act, a journalist's guide to surviving cyber regulation, is on November 16 in London.

According to e-minister Patricia Hewitt, the new rules must \"strike the right balance between protecting the privacy of individuals and enabling industry and business to get the maximum benefit from new communications technology\". They have been welcomed by employers' organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry, which believes that routine monitoring of email is both normal and acceptable. But for trades unions or civil liberties organisations, the main concern is the imbalance between the rights of employers and those being monitored. \"We have been calling for the regulation of surveillance for some time now,\"said John Wadham, director of human rights group Liberty, \"but these regulations do not go far enough to protect people's privacy.\" Yaman Akdeniz, director of online civil liberties pressure group Cyber-Rights and Cyber-Liberties, calls the regulations \"very vague\" and fears \"anything is justified under them\". Caspar Bowden, director of the Foundation for Internet Policy Research, says: \"The DTI has given bullying bosses carte blanche to pry and exploit knowledge of the private lives of employees.\" But, there is a general acceptance that some degree of monitoring of email and web use is legitimate. If an employee is on holiday, ill, on a delayed train or away at a conference, it is important that email is dealt with and working documents can be accessed. In these cases, says Akdeniz, employers should be obliged to tell staff what they are doing, since \"whatever policy they use it should be open and transparent to the employees\". Wadham wants employees to ensure that \"everyone knows that their communications are going to be under surveillance and under what circumstances\". The new regulations state clearly that only \"communications relevant to the system controller's business\" can be monitored and recorded. Yet people may send and receive emails which reveal office affairs or health problems, and these could be being read by managers and systems administrators. One solution is for staff to be told that personal use of the system is not allowed, although this would be hard to enforce. Wadham believes workers should be provided with guaranteed privacy in some areas, perhaps through a separate personal email account for non-work matters. Employers could also agree not to restrict staff use of web-based email, limiting their interest to communications from work email addresses. Even with an agreed policy, there are still problems when monitoring is secret, perhaps because an employee is suspected of criminal activity or breaking their contract. It is also highly likely that monitoring will uncover personal information which is not relevant to the job. Nigel Wildish, an expert in IT law at London law firm Field Fisher Waterhouse, thinks \"the issue is to what extent an employer can intercept or block employee email that is not to do with the business\". He cites the need to stop viruses or block obscene material as legitimate. Journalists are worried because many have confidential sources who use email from their workplaces. Milverton Wallace, organiser of the annual NetMedia conference for online journalists, has arranged a seminar on legal ways around the regulations. He says: \"Unless we can find ways of guaranteeing that our communications with sources are really confidential, we will not be able to expose wrongdoing or investigate government or business effectively.\" The new regulations do not address the issue of how an employer uses the information obtained. If personal data is being read then the Data Protection Act (DPA) comes into force. This requires that personal data should be obtained legally and used fairly - a provision absent from RIPA. The Data Protection Registrar has just published a draft code of conduct on the use of personal data in employer/ employee relationships which deals with monitoring email. It accepts that \"not all monitoring necessarily falls within the scope of the Act\", but argues that \"systems that involve the interception of personal electronic communications such as email will almost certainly be covered\". Employers would have to ensure \"monitoring operates in such a way that it does not intrude unnecessarily on employees' privacy or autonomy\". Phil Jones, assistant commissioner in the registrar's office, says this could mean an employer who acquires personal information by surveillance under the RIPA regulations could still be prosecuted by the DPR. \"We are saying that when there is going to be any form of monitoring of email or phone calls then the fair thing to do is to be open with individuals. There should be clear policies\", he says. Rod Armitage, head of legal affairs at the Confederation of British Industry, has criticised the draft code for not acknowledging the needs of employers. \"It has failed to recognise the context in which business email systems work,\" he says. However, Jones feels that the possible conflict has been rather overstated. \"The code is a draft that covers lots of employee and personnel issues\", he said, \"and interception is a minor part.\" But he admits that \"we may see legal challenges to how interception is carried out, although not to the fact of doing it\". Wildish says that \"the RIPA powers are wider and more helpful to employers than the Data Protection Registrar's code of practice\", and he is critical of the DTI and the DPR for \"not talking together before they launched this\". Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which became part of UK law on October 1, guarantees respect for private life, while Article 10 gives a right to freedom of expression. Judges are now bound to consider all legislation within the context of this act. This means that intrusive, excessive or unreasonable surveillance could be illegal, despite the RIPA regulations. Wildish says: \"it is difficult to see how the Human Rights Act will be interpreted. For one thing, companies have human rights too, including the right not to have viruses infect systems\". When employers do not clearly state their policies, employees will be forced to act on the basis that their email is being read and their web visits logged. The only hope for those concerned for civil liberties comes from Nigel Wildish, who points out that \"an employer needs a system that complies with all three acts, so the one most favourable to employees will determine how much employers can intercept\". At present that means that the Data Protection Registrar's draft code of conduct offers the best way of stopping snooping employers. We can therefore expect to see intensive lobbying of the Registrar before the code is finalised in January, as employers attempt to make it easier to monitor their staff. What employees can do Perhaps the most useful thing you can do is to try to make your employers issue guidelines on how and why they will monitor email and internet use. If they refuse, assume the worst -they are reading everything. There are limits to how secure you can make yourself when using a work computer on a work network, simply because whoever owns the hardware and internet connection controls almost everything. They can read cached web pages, look at your mail boxes, log messages at the server, tap into the physical network, grab all data passing through the router or firewall and even log every key press and mouse click you make. Use your own mobile phone at work for personal calls (assuming your desk is not wired for sound) and your own laptop for all personal files or emails. You could even bring a laptop and modem into work and dial up your own ISP - although you may get into trouble for making 'personal' calls. The latest handheld computers or top of the range mobile phones will let you surf the web and send email - and you don't have to limit yourself to the low-tech Wap services. If this is not possible, stop using work computers for private email or Web surfing. Find the local cybercafe and head there at lunchtimes instead of having a sandwich at your desk. If you really have to be online for your friends while you are at work, think carefully about what you are doing. Web-based email services such as HotMail may seem secure because your messages are stored on their computers and sent over their connections, but the web pages you are looking at still have to come into (and go out of) your work network and this means they can be monitored. Since you are using the work computer and internet connection, this is even allowed under RIPA. You can get secure web email - Hushmail.com offers the best-known service and the British campaigning group Cyber Rights and Cyber Liberties has just set up its own Hushmail service at www.cyber-rights.net This will give you private email, although the fact that you are using an encrypted mail service may attract attention. So you also need to use Anonymiser to hide the web pages you are visiting from any curious systems administrator. Unfortunately if your employers have installed keystroke logging software not even this will help as they will still be able to find out what you are typing. And if MI5 or the police want to monitor your activities in cyberspace, you stand very little chance of keeping things from them unless you invest significant time and effort in it. Posting hand-written letters may be your only option. See also...

      "bodyText": "The goverment yesterday accused the BBC of deliberate distortion in its reporting of the readiness of the NHS to cope with a winter crisis. The prime minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, forced its flagship Today programme to tone down claims that the NHS faces a more severe beds crisis than last year after insisting that the BBC's own hospital survey showed just the opposite. In a foretaste of election tussles to come on a critical political battleground the Department of Health first intervened to protest about the way the survey was being reported after monitoring the earliest bulletins of the day on Radio 4. After getting replies from 81 of the 123 UK health authorities the BBC concluded that 73 expected this winter to produce \"the same or more pressure\" on the NHS. In fact 47 of the authorities had said it would be the same and 71 reported they were now \"very or fairly confident\" that they were better placed to deal with winter pressures. The answers which justified the gloomy tone of the BBC's report - \"most hospital administrators feel there are some very difficult months ahead\" - came when 31 authorities said they expected to cancel non-urgent surgery (29 did not) and 22 said they expected greater pressure than last winter. Though the Today programme stuck to its guns and interviewed both Dr Liam Fox, the Tory health spokesman and Nigel Crisp - on his first day as the NHS's new chief executive and Department of Health permanent secretary - the BBC's initial claims were qualified as the morning wore on. Mr Crisp's officials had seen the survey overnight and he took it into the Today studio. \"I have got your survey in front of me which I must say I think is encouraging because it is saying that people are planning for winter,\" he declared. No 10 called the BBC line \"an outrage\". By midday the BBC's website presented the survey in more emollient terms, with an opening paragraph revealing that \"health authorities expect to face severe pressure this winter - but believe they will cope better this time around\". \"It became less bad, but it was still wrong right up to 9 o'clock when it was being reported that the Department of Health spokesman was saying that 90% of health authorities questioned (71) thought they were better off, though it was actually their own survey which said that,\" said a senior health official. \"In effect they were reporting the positive news as if it was spin and spinning news that did not really exist. The substance of the survery was good, it was the BBC spin that was bad.\" Downing Street remained angry. Mr Campbell later fired off a letter of protest which was being studied at the BBC last night prior to a formal reply No 10 wants an investigation of what Tony Blair's spokesman called \"sad and totally unacceptable (behaviour) by the BBC's flagship programme\" in seeking to copy the Tory tabloids in generating a sense of winter crisis again as the expected May election looms. The issue is hyper-sensitive to both sides at Westminster because the government has belatedly commited billions of extra cash to NHS reform and better delivery of services to sceptical voters. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, on Tuesday signed a \"concordat\" with the private sector to buy their services for NHS patients. In his letter to Tony Hall, the BBC's chief executive, Mr Campbell complained that reporting that \"highlights and over-dramatises selective information from surveys and which underplays other equally, if not more significant findings should have no place in BBC News\".",

      "bodyText": "The equal opportunities commission yesterday backed plans to modernise the House of Commons , saying scrapping all-night sittings would lure more women to Parliament. Ending all debates at 10pm will prove more \"family friendly\", the commission believes, while reforms to introduce timetabling of debates will make Parliament more efficient and effective. The commission's unequivocal support for the plans - which would form part of the most radical shake-up of Parliament in 20 years - was outlined in a letter from its chairwoman, Julie Mellor, to Margaret Beckett, leader of the Commons and chairwoman of its modernisation committee , which will be released to MPs today in preparation for their debate on modernisation on Tuesday. In the letter, Ms Mellor con gratulates the modernisation committee on approving the plans, and notes: \"I am sure these changes will pave the way for further changes to make the House of Commons more efficient, effective and family friendly\". She adds that the proposals would \"make the job of an MP more attractive to a greater variety of women and men\". She suggests even more could be done to make Parliament more efficient, including ensuring MPs manage their work more efficiently, and the development of a culture that supports \"the professionalism of politicians\". Support from the commission is likely to be seized on by Labour backbenchers who have been pressing for more civilised hours. One MP said: \"It's important because it shows many people outside are watching how modernisation progresses and want to see an efficient and modern house.\" Conservative politicians are still expected to oppose the end of late night sittings, claiming it will weaken the ability of the Opposition to hold the government to account and amounts to a cynical attempt to stifle them. Forcing MPs to sit through the night is an old tactic to disrupt the governement's timetabling of Commons business, and was used by Labour MPs throughout the eighties. The committee, which has already initiated reforms ensuring backbenchers can hold more debates in the mornings and allowing MPs to leave the Commons earlier on Thursdays, suggests debates end at 10pm from Monday to Wednesday, allowing MPs to escape from Westminster after voting at 10.30pm. But it also offers an olive branch to the Conservatives and Lib Dems by proposing a cross-party committee to agree on how the government timetables Commons debates.",

Nearly 900 students taking a range of arts degrees were covered in the assessment for the Falmouth college of arts meanwhile, compared to only 60 undergraduates on the bachelor of arts degree inspected at Oxford university. The inspections, often a sore point among academics as they create much paperwork, cover six broad areas: curriculum design; teaching and learning assessment; student progression; student support; learning resources; and quality management. The Quality assurance agency, which oversees the inspections, is currently drafting plans for new style assessments that promise a 'lighter touch' for institutions. The latest raft of results would help justify such a move: only three cases from hundreds of inspections emerge where departments actually failed. Liverpool university's nursing department, Derby's medical course and Wigan and Leigh college's art and design courses managed to score only one out of four in one of the six sections assessed - a result leading automatically to a re-inspection. Yet there are many concerns that the assessments should not be turned into an exercise either too vague or jargon-ridden that it is of no benefit to the customers of higher education: students. In keeping with the widely used practice within the academic sector, we list here the total cumulative scores for the assessments so far made available by the QAA. These provide a good guide to the teaching quality at the department. Those interested in the detailed results, should access the reports available on the QAA website",

      "bodyText": "Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools, yesterday stepped up his attack on A-level standards but stoked fresh controversy by admitting he had no research-based evidence to support his claim. In heated exchanges in the Commons, Mr Woodhead clashed with MPs on the education select committee over his \"personal style\" as head of Ofsted, and defended his \"public forays\" into areas of education that did not fall within his remit. Questioned by MPs about highly publicised remarks in an interview with the Guardian, when he claimed that A-levels should be made more difficult, Mr Woodhead insisted he had never claimed the \"gold standard\" exams were too easy. \"We don't have the evidence to know, and that is true of GCSEs as well,\" he said. He took issue with the Guardian's headline, which read \"A-levels too easy, says Woodhead\", but continued: \"We have got to make A-level and GCSE examinations even more demanding\". Otherwise, the drive to raise standards in schools could be affected, as the difficulty of exams had a \"profound influence on what happens in classrooms and one of their prime purposes is discriminating between students\". During a lengthy session with the committee, Mr Woodhead was rebuked by the chairman, Barry Sheerman, for being \"offensive\" to another MP and for his habit of making making \"flip remarks\" about important issues\". But the head of the Office for Standards in Education insisted that he would not be censored on areas perceived to be outside his remit - such as higher education - and that he would continue to speak out when he felt it necessary. Mr Sheerman said that \"there is a feeling that those forays sometimes detract from the overall work of Ofsted\". A Liberal Democrat MP, Evan Harris, asked Mr Woodhead to clarify the remarks in the interview with the Guardian in September, saying he could not understand the difference between A-levels not being too easy and needing to be more difficult. \"I'm sorry if you find it difficult to hold those two propositions in your head but I don't think it's that hard really\", Mr Woodhead retorted. Mr Sheerman said he found it offensive that Mr Woodhead should make such a remark about the undisputed intelligence of a committee member who held an Oxford medical degree. Mr Woodhead also faced criticism for failing to meet researchers representing the commission for racial equality, and claiming to be too busy during a four month investigation into race inequality in England's schools. Mr Sheerman said Mr Woodhead was guilty of \"flawed judgment\" in passing the matter on to colleagues, saying: \"I don't think that was good enough in terms of the standards in public life that I've been used to.\" The Liberal Democrat education spokesman, Phil Willis, later called on the government to sack Mr Woodhead for bringing Ofsted into disrepute. \"His refusal to supply any evidence to back up his outrageous claims about A-level standards and vacuous degrees means he is totally out of control,\" he said. \"While it is rumoured he has plans to resign before the next election and embarrass Labour ministers with his views, he should not be given the option.

The current editor says the response was of a different order to anything else he has seen since he took over the paper (and this is the editor who presided over the demise of Aitken, Hamilton and Mandelson). What was that about? </p> <p>I think something rather odd happened. Normally, when you publish an investigation in a newspaper, you hope you are uncovering something which nobody knows. With these stories, however, we did the reverse - we delivered something which masses of people knew but which no one with any power would admit. That torrential response was not shock or horror but a clamour of recognition of a reality that was being denied. </p> <p>In the 18 months I spent researching them, I got deeper into the workings of a government department than I have ever done before. It was not a reassuring experience. I started with a vague feeling of unspecified benevolence towards the secretary of state for education, David Blunkett. I came out with a feeling close to contempt, having peered into a department which, I eventually concluded, was habitually lying and cheating and was presiding over a shambles - something which it was enabled to do mainly by the scale of that self-same dishonesty. </p> <p>I came away with a picture of ministers beset by problems and lost for solutions - lost, either because they simply didn't understand the issues well enough to know what to do, or because they did know and couldn't bear the political consequences. Rather than admit they were stuck, they were reaching for pseudo-solutions, policies which gave them something to talk about, gave the appearance of action, gave the pundits something to chew on while the real problems sat unsolved in the background, because (as the ministers often very well knew) the alleged solutions were entirely bogus. </p> <p>We looked at Fresh Start, Mr Blunkett's brave new cure for the weakest schools - and found a mass of evidence which had discredited the idea in the United States years before Mr Blunkett ever pulled it out of his briefcase and started pretending it should be taken seriously. We looked at \"special measures\", the routine procedure for dealing with a school that fails its Ofsted report - and (after months of negotiations) we dug out statistics which completely contradicted the ministers' grandiose claims of success. We looked at the official claims for the virtues of our \"mentoring\" scheme - and then unearthed the department's own devastating find ings of its miserable weakness. These initiatives are high-octane guff. And they reflect the great underlying problem, that the entire strategy of Mr Blunkett's department is based on an analysis of school failure which has the intellectual weight of a joke in a Christmas cracker. Everything else flows from that analysis, and the simple reality is that it's phony. </p> <p>And then there are the outright lies. In one of the early stories, we gave credit to Mr Blunkett for securing a \u00a319bn increase in funding for education - a few months later, we discovered that we had been conned. Well, the whole country had been conned. What was worse, the conman got away with it. On the single occasion when he was challenged about it - in the House of Commons, by the Liberal Democrat education spokesman, Phil Willis - Hansard records the secretary of state's reaction. He laughed. And that was that (although he never again repeated the \u00a319bn lie). </p> <p>This is a lesson not just about the cynicism of politicians but also about our own gullibility - particularly our gullibility as journalists. We allow Whitehall to manage us: Mr Blunkett makes a big announcement about extra funds for Fresh Start schools; we report it, as though there were some kind of sense in it; and then we go off into micro- criticism of its detail, whether this is quite enough extra cash, whether there is really such a thing as a superhead, without explaining that the whole project is a proven failure. We are pushed into a sideshow. </p> <p> W ithin a week of Mr Blunkett first telling his \u00a319bn-whopper, he was caught out by the Treasury select committee, who exposed the most successful of his several sleights of hand. They did the same for the then health secretary, Frank Dobson, whose claims about new cash for his department were similarly fictitious. The point is that the press missed the story. The Treasury select committee's report sank like a stone, the journalists chased off to the next press conference, and the various ministers carried on fibbing for 18 months before they were caught out. (Frank Dobson's budget was exposed as a hoax by BBC Panorama, by coincidence, in the week after we took apart Mr Blunkett's.) </p> <p>I spent the first three or four months of this research being as stupid as it is possible for a journalist to be without getting sacked. I started, in the approved fashion, by reading files of old newspaper stories; I read the book by the former education minister, George Walden; I went to see senior people at the Department for Education and Ofsted. And I emerged with the clear view that school failure was primarily caused by bad teachers and, in particular, by bad teachers who had been led astray by \"trendy teaching methods\" from the 1960s. Then two things happened. First, I read a book called Failing School Failing City by Martin Johnson, a veteran teacher and now president of the NASUWT union. Then I started going into schools. And I realised that my working theory was complete garbage, that the truth was simpler, nastier and very plain to see, as the first two stories, set in Sheffield, attempted to make clear: you cannot make sense of why some schools fail and some succeed without taking account of the corrosive impact of child poverty, which has soared in this country in the past 20 years. Combine that with the effects of the Conservative education reforms of the late 1980s and you have a design for educational failure. </p> <p>You can look at any area of our schooling system - the effect of private schools on their state counterparts, the scale and distribution of funding, teacher stress and teacher pay, syllabus and teaching technique, truancy and exclusion, the outbreak of teacher cheating in exams - and you cannot explain what is happening unless you take primary account of child poverty and Kenneth Baker's reforms. There are other factors in there as well, but those two are essential. The reality is that unless Mr Blunkett acknowledges this and until he finds the political courage to scrap almost all of the market-driven reforms of the late 1980s, none of the dinky little schemes which he has launched will save our schools from crisis. </p> <p>The School Report by Nick Davies is published today by Vintage, \u00a36.99. <br><strong><a href=\"http://www.uk.bol.com\">Buy it at BOL</a></strong> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:davies@pavilion.co.uk\">davies@pavilion.co.uk</a></p>",

The south-west section of the M25 and the M3 in Hampshire were waterlogged, while parts of the M1 in Nottinghamshire was also partly submerged. After an electrical storm hit London and the south-east this morning the fire brigade said that it was dealing with up to 50 reports of flooding - mostly in the capital's southern suburbs More than an inch of rain fell in just an hour in the west Chilterns as the deluge swept into the capital before heading north towards the midlands. In Yorkshire, water levels in the River Ouse and River Derwent were still high and being closely monitored, with just under an inch of rain expected in the next 20 hours. York city officials said that its \u00a38m flood defence system had stopped damage from being much worse after flood waters threatened historic monuments. Elsewhere, flood warnings were lifted on most rivers in Hampshire, Sussex and Kent despite an inch of rain falling across the three counties.

      "body": "<p>When Zahid Mubarek, 19, was sentenced to 90 days in Feltham young offenders' institution for shoplifting \u00a36 worth of razor blades and interfering with a motor vehicle, he and his family were shocked. Zahid, from east London, was a well-meaning lad, perhaps a touch naive, who had fallen in with the wrong crowd. He seemed genuinely sorry, and in letters to his family he speculated about joining the army full time, having spent time on manoeuvres through the Prince's Trust.</p> <p>He never got the chance. Tragically, the short sharp shock turned out to be a life sentence. Five hours before he was due to be released, while his family were preparing a welcome home celebration, Zahid was beaten to death with a wooden table leg by his cell mate, Robert Stewart, 20, a racist psychopath with a history of violence who was on remand for sending malicious communications.</p> <p>Yesterday Stewart was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment at Kingston crown court.</p> <p>Zahid's death has devastated and angered his family, who originate from Pakistan, in equal measure. His father says they are still not over the shock of losing the eldest son, and that the crucial question concerning his death remains unanswered: why was an Asian petty thief put in the same cell as a violent racist who openly expressed admiration for the killers of Stephen Lawrence? The question remains despite Stewart's conviction.</p> <p>Last night, Zahid's father demanded that the Home Office answer the question through a full judicial inquiry into racism in the prison service. \"The real tragedy is that my son's murder could have been avoided if the prison service had done its job properly,\" he said. \"My son should never have been put in the same cell as him.</p> <p>\"Why didn't the prison service read the 200-odd letters which are not only abusive and racist but predict my son's murder?\"</p> <p>The Mubarek family has already received an apology from Martin Narey, director-general of the prison service.</p> <p>In the early hours of March 21 this year, Stewart took the table leg and, in the dim glow cast by the the toilet light, began to batter the sleeping Mubarek. He hit him between seven and 11 times. \"It was mad,\" he wrote in a subsequent letter to a friend also charged with murder. \"His head splattered all over like a tomato fucking everywhere.\"</p> <p>With Mubarek slipping into a coma from which he would never recover, Stewart calmly pushed the alarm button in the cell. When prison officers arrived he pointed at the bloodied figure on the bed next to him and said: \"He's had an accident.\" Later, when asked why he had done it, Stewart replied: \"I don't even know myself.\" Twenty minutes later he slept as he awaited the police; one prison officer said: \"He looked like he was in a world of his own.\"</p> <p>Evidence disclosed at Stewart's trial revealed that prison staff knew of his racial prejudices, his violent tendencies and unpredictable behaviour, yet still allowed him to share a cell with his victim. A series of letters written by Stewart, who has RIP tattooed on his forehead, revealed a man with deep-seated racist views.</p> <p>In one letter dated the day before he killed Mubarek, he wrote: \"Did you watch Romper Stomper [a film about skinheads] the other day? Fat film. I wish dem [sic] blokes were in and dem what killed Stephen Lawrence. The niggers would soon shut up.</p> <p>\"I'm going to nail bomb the Asian community of Great Norbury. Its [sic] all about immigrants getting smuggled into here, Romanians, Pakis, niggers, Chinkies, taking over the country and using us to breed half castes.\"</p> <p>A letter written a month before the attack provided a chilling forecast of the murder of Mr Mubarek: \"If I don't get bail on the 7th I'll take extreme measures to get shipped out. I'll kill me fucking pad mate if I have to. Bleach me sheets and pillowcases white, make myself a Ku Klux Klan suit and walk out me pad holding a flaming cross.\"</p> <p>The letter ended with a scrawled swastika.</p> <p>In another he wrote: \"It's shit in here. Planet of the apes. I've got a pad mate to come back to. A Paki.\"</p> <p>Prison officers at Feltham testified that 10% of all letters are read for censorship purposes and that if anything disturbing is found all mail sent by that inmate is monitored. Of the hundreds of letters Stewart wrote before the attack in which he made his racism clear, just one was intercepted and returned to him, but no further action was taken.</p> <p>Stewart's conviction raises fresh questions about Feltham, the largest young offenders' institution in the UK, home to 745 inmates. Last year the chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham. described it as \"rotten to the core\". In August a deputy governor resigned in protest at the Dickensian conditions and last week Lord Woolf said one of the factors in setting a minimum tariff for the killers of James Bulger was the \"corrosive\" atmosphere they would face in institutions such as Feltham.</p> <p>Imran Khan, solicitor acting for the Mubareks, yesterday said the case was a \"wake-up call\" for the prison service, and drew parallels with the murder of Stephen Lawrence and its effect on the police force.</p> <p>\"This is a wake-up call for the prison service in the same way Stephen Lawrence was a wake-up call for the police force,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Khan added that negligence and institutional racism pervaded Britain's prisons, and called for an inquiry.</p> <p>DCI Paul McAleenan of the Metropolitan police, who led the inquiry, welcomed the verdict and said a file on all the circumstances of the death had been passed to the CPS.</p> <p>The murder sets Feltham's failings in harsh relief. Stewart had prepared his weapon some time before the attack. He had snapped it off, then propped it back under the table and covered the upper half with a cloth. Cells are subject to a daily \"fabric\" check in which window bars and doors are tested, but only get a full search every three months.</p> <p>Stewart's history should also have suggested to the prison service that he posed a potential threat to his cellmate.</p> <p>Born and raised in Hyde, an impoverished suburb on the eastern edge of the greater Manchester sprawl, Stewart became institutionalised from a young age. Beaten severely by his father and ignored by his mother, he was in care by the age of 14 and was referred to a child psychiatrist.</p> <p>Soon Stewart scaled the bottom rung of the criminal ladder, becoming involved in burglaries, car crime and occasional arson. At 15 he received his first custodial sentence and by the time he reached Feltham earlier this year he had served in nine young offenders' institutions. He has 19 previous convictions on 69 counts, including actual bodily harm - he stabbed a man in the face with a screwdriver as he tried to steal his car - and common assault.</p> <p>His prison record contains plentiful evidence of what both crown and defence psychiatric experts later diagnosed as \"psychopathy\". Stewart was diagnosed as having a personality disorder in 1997 but was not tested again until he was allowed to share a cell with with his victim.</p> <p>In a two-year period from 1997, at several institutions, Stewart committed a litany of violent, disruptive and dangerous offences. He removed bricks from his cell wall in an attempt to escape. He threw the entire contents of his cell including a mattress out of the window and was moved to a segregation unit. In addition, Stewart conducted a dirty protest and set fire to his cell.</p> <p>He also has a history of self-harm. He tried to set fire to himself and in 1998 at Lancaster Farms young offenders' institution he attempted to hang himself.</p> <p>Just as his violent tendencies were no mystery to prison authorities, nor was his unpredictable state of mind. His prison file, which runs to 56 pages, is littered with references from senior officers to his fragile mental health and the danger he posed to others, yet these were apparently ignored when the decision was taken to put Stewart and Mubarek in the same cell.</p> <p>One entry on his file reads: \"Unable to control his impulsive actions, he has been started on medication. Displays of unpredictable and erratic behaviour and determined to escape.\" Another senior officer suggested that a doctor should see him.</p> <p>A third entry demonstrates a clear awareness of the risk Stewart posed to others: \"This lad is a disaster waiting to happen. He cannot be trusted ... I feel we're just waiting for our next problem.\"</p> <p>The \"problems\" have continued. On the eve of his murder trial, Stewart took a prisoner hostage and threatened him with a knife. Neither does he appear to understand remorse. During the trial he said he did not feel regret at what he had done, and on the opening day he aimed a V sign at the Mubarek family.</p> <p>Philip Joseph, a forensic psychologist, described Stewart as \"the classic example of a controlled psychopath\".</p> <p>Zahid's father prefers a less academic description: \"That man is just evil, there is no other word to describe it. We will never get over what he has done,\" he said.</p>",

In the early hours of March 21 this year, Stewart took the table leg and, in the dim glow cast by the the toilet light, began to batter the sleeping Mubarek. He hit him between seven and 11 times. \"It was mad,\" he wrote in a subsequent letter to a friend also charged with murder. \"His head splattered all over like a tomato fucking everywhere.\" With Mubarek slipping into a coma from which he would never recover, Stewart calmly pushed the alarm button in the cell. When prison officers arrived he pointed at the bloodied figure on the bed next to him and said: \"He's had an accident.\" Later, when asked why he had done it, Stewart replied: \"I don't even know myself.\" Twenty minutes later he slept as he awaited the police; one prison officer said: \"He looked like he was in a world of his own.\" Evidence disclosed at Stewart's trial revealed that prison staff knew of his racial prejudices, his violent tendencies and unpredictable behaviour, yet still allowed him to share a cell with his victim. A series of letters written by Stewart, who has RIP tattooed on his forehead, revealed a man with deep-seated racist views. In one letter dated the day before he killed Mubarek, he wrote: \"Did you watch Romper Stomper [a film about skinheads] the other day? Fat film. I wish dem [sic] blokes were in and dem what killed Stephen Lawrence. The niggers would soon shut up. \"I'm going to nail bomb the Asian community of Great Norbury. Its [sic] all about immigrants getting smuggled into here, Romanians, Pakis, niggers, Chinkies, taking over the country and using us to breed half castes.\" A letter written a month before the attack provided a chilling forecast of the murder of Mr Mubarek: \"If I don't get bail on the 7th I'll take extreme measures to get shipped out. I'll kill me fucking pad mate if I have to. Bleach me sheets and pillowcases white, make myself a Ku Klux Klan suit and walk out me pad holding a flaming cross.\" The letter ended with a scrawled swastika. In another he wrote: \"It's shit in here. Planet of the apes. I've got a pad mate to come back to. A Paki.\" Prison officers at Feltham testified that 10% of all letters are read for censorship purposes and that if anything disturbing is found all mail sent by that inmate is monitored. Of the hundreds of letters Stewart wrote before the attack in which he made his racism clear, just one was intercepted and returned to him, but no further action was taken. Stewart's conviction raises fresh questions about Feltham, the largest young offenders' institution in the UK, home to 745 inmates. Last year the chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham. described it as \"rotten to the core\". In August a deputy governor resigned in protest at the Dickensian conditions and last week Lord Woolf said one of the factors in setting a minimum tariff for the killers of James Bulger was the \"corrosive\" atmosphere they would face in institutions such as Feltham. Imran Khan, solicitor acting for the Mubareks, yesterday said the case was a \"wake-up call\" for the prison service, and drew parallels with the murder of Stephen Lawrence and its effect on the police force. \"This is a wake-up call for the prison service in the same way Stephen Lawrence was a wake-up call for the police force,\" he said. Mr Khan added that negligence and institutional racism pervaded Britain's prisons, and called for an inquiry. DCI Paul McAleenan of the Metropolitan police, who led the inquiry, welcomed the verdict and said a file on all the circumstances of the death had been passed to the CPS. The murder sets Feltham's failings in harsh relief. Stewart had prepared his weapon some time before the attack. He had snapped it off, then propped it back under the table and covered the upper half with a cloth. Cells are subject to a daily \"fabric\" check in which window bars and doors are tested, but only get a full search every three months. Stewart's history should also have suggested to the prison service that he posed a potential threat to his cellmate. Born and raised in Hyde, an impoverished suburb on the eastern edge of the greater Manchester sprawl, Stewart became institutionalised from a young age. Beaten severely by his father and ignored by his mother, he was in care by the age of 14 and was referred to a child psychiatrist. Soon Stewart scaled the bottom rung of the criminal ladder, becoming involved in burglaries, car crime and occasional arson. At 15 he received his first custodial sentence and by the time he reached Feltham earlier this year he had served in nine young offenders' institutions. He has 19 previous convictions on 69 counts, including actual bodily harm - he stabbed a man in the face with a screwdriver as he tried to steal his car - and common assault. His prison record contains plentiful evidence of what both crown and defence psychiatric experts later diagnosed as \"psychopathy\". Stewart was diagnosed as having a personality disorder in 1997 but was not tested again until he was allowed to share a cell with with his victim. In a two-year period from 1997, at several institutions, Stewart committed a litany of violent, disruptive and dangerous offences. He removed bricks from his cell wall in an attempt to escape. He threw the entire contents of his cell including a mattress out of the window and was moved to a segregation unit. In addition, Stewart conducted a dirty protest and set fire to his cell. He also has a history of self-harm. He tried to set fire to himself and in 1998 at Lancaster Farms young offenders' institution he attempted to hang himself. Just as his violent tendencies were no mystery to prison authorities, nor was his unpredictable state of mind. His prison file, which runs to 56 pages, is littered with references from senior officers to his fragile mental health and the danger he posed to others, yet these were apparently ignored when the decision was taken to put Stewart and Mubarek in the same cell. One entry on his file reads: \"Unable to control his impulsive actions, he has been started on medication. Displays of unpredictable and erratic behaviour and determined to escape.\" Another senior officer suggested that a doctor should see him. A third entry demonstrates a clear awareness of the risk Stewart posed to others: \"This lad is a disaster waiting to happen. He cannot be trusted ... I feel we're just waiting for our next problem.\" The \"problems\" have continued. On the eve of his murder trial, Stewart took a prisoner hostage and threatened him with a knife. Neither does he appear to understand remorse. During the trial he said he did not feel regret at what he had done, and on the opening day he aimed a V sign at the Mubarek family. Philip Joseph, a forensic psychologist, described Stewart as \"the classic example of a controlled psychopath\". Zahid's father prefers a less academic description: \"That man is just evil, there is no other word to describe it. We will never get over what he has done,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "The latest ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Palestinians was gravely undermined today when car bombers struck in Jerusalem's crowded Mahane Yehuda market, killing two people. The bombing came minutes before the ceasefire, hammered out by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and veteran Israeli negotiator Shimon Peres, was due to take effect. The ceasefire is ultra fragile and, with tension running sky-high, a single incident could reignite the conflagration which has claimed at least 162 lives since the end of September. But after five weeks of mayhem, it is the first small sign that peace can return. Already, Israeli troops have begun pulling back tanks and other vehicles from flashpoints, and the assorted Palestinian security forces have started, almost for the first time, to restrain stone-throwers. The intifada - the mass uprising against Israeli rule by thousands of Palestinians - is on hold, for the moment at least. Today's bombing, part of a separate and continuing terror campaign by extremist Palestinian militia, will undoubtedly inflame the situation but does not denote the collapse of the ceasefire. Peres is perhaps the only man in the region who could have persuaded Yasser Arafat to order his forces to quell the disturbances. Since the fighting erupted on September 28, the Palestinian president has bellowed defiance to Israel and the world. He has claimed throughout that Israel was to blame, for allowing maverick rightwing leader Ariel Sharon to visit the Jerusalem Haram al-Sharif mosque compound. He has also bitterly criticised the brutal Israeli military response to the initial rioting. Israelis, for their part, almost universally believe that Arafat deliberately and cynically stoked the intifada to force territorial concessions, especially in Jerusalem. As the blood and recriminations flowed, many observers believed that the Middle East peace process was doomed, and that Israel might even resume its military occupation of the territories controlled by Arafat on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Now that dire prospect is receding, thanks in large measure to Peres who, in his late seventies, has lost none of his flair and taste for deal-making. Peres is a consummate wheeler-dealer. He has been at the centre of Israel's vituperative, ill-tempered political system since the state was founded more than 50 years ago. He has been prime minister four times, a long serving foreign minister, and always the eminence grise behind whichever throne he could find. It was Peres who secretly negotiated the 1993 Oslo peace accord that stunned the world, and Peres who nudged forward the negotiations which brought Arafat back to Palestine. Ironically, it was also Peres who, after the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, brought the peace process to the brink of collapse with a series of blunders that led the election of a rightwing Likud government.

As military helicopters and planes fly overhead, the transfixed birds lean further and further back until they topple over. Now the Royal Navy vessel HMS Endurance has been drafted in by scientists to visit the island of South Georgia, near the Falklands, to study whether airtraffic is changing the birds' natural behaviour and making them fall over. The phenomenon was first noticed by servicemen during the Falklands conflict as the skies filled with aircraft. The crew of the Endurance have suggested that the comical-looking birds are mesmerised by the aircraft which they may regard as predators. Operations officer Stuart Matthews said: \"Some environmentalists want to limit flights because they claim there is an environmental impact on the penguins.\" For five weeks this winter scientists will film the birds' reaction as Endurance's two Lynx helicopters fly over the isolated British outpost. Their findings could affect the way all countries operate aircraft in the southern wastelands. The project, conducted by Endurance and Richard Stone of the British Antarctic Survey, is the biggest yet organised. Dr Stone said the scientists would also be checking the penguins' stress levels. \"We are prepared to watch them flap around and fall over as helicopters go over,\" he said. \"The penguins also tend to shake their heads and flap their flippers. If something disturbs them enough they move away or even start running.\" The survey will focus on the island's population of king penguins, the second biggest penguin in the world, weighing 35kg and a metre in height.

Either that, or in giving his first press conference as England manager, Sven-Goran Eriksson has provided enough rope to hang himself, his assistant Tord Grip and as many Swedes as Jeff Powell can get his hands on. (Only joking there, Jeff Jeff??? Jeff!!!)</p> <p>Svennis the Menace, as he henceforth will be known until we think of something better, took his opportunity today to impress upon the press just how proud he is to manage England, a country whose football he has always admired. \"If you look around you know why I took the job,\" he said, presumably asking the room to look around at a bunch of wrinkled bilious hacks. \"I think it is one of the most prestigious jobs you can have. I am honoured and pleased and I hope to do well.\"</p> <p>All well and good. Svennis then went on to say that he was \"hopeful\" of taking charge of the three World Cup qualifiers England face in March and June next year, and that there was a lot of talent in the current England set-up (even if, when asked, he could not name the Leicester goalkeeper). However, in his one-hour grilling, Svennis did manage one mistake of Al Gore-normous proportions. </p> <p>\"I have always been very close to England and English football,\" Svennis told the world. \"I have been in the Boot Room at Liverpool with Joe Fagan and on the bench for one game when Bobby Robson won the title with Ipswich.\" The title that Robson never won, that is (Ipswich's sole Championship coming in 1962). Now, where's that Powell got to?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>BIG CUP, BAD BEHAVIOUR</strong></p> <p>When in Prague, the Fiver likes to belt out the Sparta hymn with much gusto. \"Ooooo Sparta! Ooooo go go!\" we sing. And we're certainly not the only ones. But at the moment, it looks like Sparta could be \"Ooooo out \" of Europe next week - and it's all down to a dirty deal which has been struck between Arsene's Arsenal Wenger and Lazio/England boss Svennis the Menace. Having already qualified for the next round, both managers have agreed to rest several key players for their final Big Cup matches next week, a move which could have serious repercussions on Sparta and Shakhtar Donetsk's battle for third spot and a place in Euro-Vase.</p> <p>What happens, for instance, if Wenger drafts in Christopher Wreh after his four years in the football wilderness? Suddenly it's advantage Sparta. And how will Atillio Lombardo's head cope with the onset of the Czech winter? You see? So, fearing a major diplomatic incident - if not a small-scale nuclear war - we decided to give Uefa a call. \"Each team has submitted a squad list of 25 players and after that it is up to each coach to decide which players he wants to field from this list,\" a Uefa spokeswoman sniffed before hanging up.</p> <p>But never mind the bureaucrats - what about the fans? \"If Lazio bench Pavel Nedved they'll be riots here,\" warns Jeff Donovan of the Prague Post. \"He used to play for Sparta and the fans want to see him back almost as much as they want to win the match.\" And if that's not bad enough, you can guess the reaction in Ukraine if Arsenal's plane arrives without the Horse on board. \"Of course Oleg Luzhny's absence will disappoint the Shakhtar fans,\" says a distraught Roman Woronowjzz of the Ukraine Weekly. \"He's, like, Ukraine's third-biggest player!\" Wenger and Svennis - shame on you both.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"We have looked for a solution and considered various alternatives.

They require \u00a340,000 and I'm saying it should be \u00a325,000 - not because I want to say \u00a325,000, but we have got a budget here.\"</p> <p>Surprisingly, Archibald was allowed to take away his personal effects - after all, the liquidators could have fetched a few quid for those down the pawn shop.

      "body": "<p>As well as publishing test reports, the Good Houskeeping Institute answers readers' queries. Here are the five most often asked about toasters </p> <p> <strong> 1 Does paying more buy better toasting?</strong> </p> <p> Not necessarily: in fact, the cheaper basic toasters tested by Good Housekeeping performed better than most of the ones in the higher price brackets. Pay more and you'll get a stylish retro design, chrome or stainless steel finish, larger capacity and extra features such as one-side toasting and the option of using one, two or four slots at a time - or even an add-on gadget for making toasted sandwiches. </p> <p> <strong> 2 Which features are worth looking for?</strong> </p> <p> A frozen bread setting is useful for those urgent freezer-to-toast moments, and variable-width slots are a must if you want to be able to toast different thicknesses of bread, muffins, rolls and crumpets. A removable crumb tray makes cleaning easier (don't forget to empty it every few uses, to avoid the smell and potential safety hazard of burning crumbs), and it's handy to have a mid-cycle cancel option in case you change your mind or it looks as if your toast is getting overdone. A well-designed high-lift option is also worth having - the loading lever lifts small items above the top of the toaster so they can be removed without burning your fingers. If you have young children in your household opt for the greater safety of a plastic-walled toaster, which will generally have cooler walls than those with a metal casing. Unless beefburgers are your staple diet, you can probably live without a one-side toasting feature. A warming rack can be useful, but reheat features tend to over-dry your toast. </p> <p> <strong> 3 Is it worth choosing an electronic sensor toaster?</strong> </p> <p> Most toasters operate on a timer system. The longer the toaster is on, the hotter the elements become and the faster the bread cooks, so if you are making consecutive batches of toast they will get darker and darker. More sophisticated electronic models have sensors which automatically adjust the browning times according to the temperature inside the toaster so browning is more consistent, especially when toasting batches of bread. However in practice we found this made little difference. None of our winning models is sensor-controlled. </p> <p> <strong> 4 If I need to do four slices at a time, which toaster should I buy?</strong> </p> <p> The Swan AH1P1 is good value for bulk browning, but if sleek design is more important to you than consistent toasting, the Kenwood TT990 (the four-slice version of the Kenwood TT390) and the Rowenta TP486 are worth a look. </p> <p> <strong> 5 Which are the best for toasting crumpets and teacakes?</strong> </p> <p> To prevent burned fingers and jamming, you need a toaster with an excellent high-lift facility and wide slots such as the Kenwood TT390, Swan AH1P1, Philips Essence or Morphy Richards Trio. The Tefal Avanti Deluxe is specially designed with angled slots and a high-lift lever to make removal of small items pain-free.</p>",

A removable crumb tray makes cleaning easier (don't forget to empty it every few uses, to avoid the smell and potential safety hazard of burning crumbs), and it's handy to have a mid-cycle cancel option in case you change your mind or it looks as if your toast is getting overdone. A well-designed high-lift option is also worth having - the loading lever lifts small items above the top of the toaster so they can be removed without burning your fingers. If you have young children in your household opt for the greater safety of a plastic-walled toaster, which will generally have cooler walls than those with a metal casing. Unless beefburgers are your staple diet, you can probably live without a one-side toasting feature. A warming rack can be useful, but reheat features tend to over-dry your toast. 3 Is it worth choosing an electronic sensor toaster? Most toasters operate on a timer system. The longer the toaster is on, the hotter the elements become and the faster the bread cooks, so if you are making consecutive batches of toast they will get darker and darker. More sophisticated electronic models have sensors which automatically adjust the browning times according to the temperature inside the toaster so browning is more consistent, especially when toasting batches of bread. However in practice we found this made little difference. None of our winning models is sensor-controlled. 4 If I need to do four slices at a time, which toaster should I buy? The Swan AH1P1 is good value for bulk browning, but if sleek design is more important to you than consistent toasting, the Kenwood TT990 (the four-slice version of the Kenwood TT390) and the Rowenta TP486 are worth a look. 5 Which are the best for toasting crumpets and teacakes? To prevent burned fingers and jamming, you need a toaster with an excellent high-lift facility and wide slots such as the Kenwood TT390, Swan AH1P1, Philips Essence or Morphy Richards Trio. The Tefal Avanti Deluxe is specially designed with angled slots and a high-lift lever to make removal of small items pain-free.",

Wisden mentioned the \"Sri Lankans' propensity to commit themselves to shots even when plagued by doubt,\" while a report by CricInfo referred to Ranatunga's \"half-hearted\" first-innings dismissal - although it also says he disputed his dismissal in the second innings scorecard 2 Delhi groundsman Ram Adhar admits he took money to doctor the pitch to suit India's spinners in the one-off Test against Australia in 1996-97. India won by seven wickets. Umpire Peter Willey said it was the worst first-day pitch he had seen, while Wisden observed that \"conspiracy theories were inevitable once the bone-dry, fractured and shifting pitch was revealed...Taylor chose to bat on what could have been mistaken for a third-day strip.\" scorecard 3 Brian Lara was alleged to have received $40,000 to underperform in two one-day internationals in India in 1994-95. His scores in the five-match series were 10, 6, 39, 89 and 47 scorecard of the 1st ODI 4 Sachin Tendulkar says he was astonished by the slow batting of Manoj Prabhakar and Nayan Mongia in a one-day match against West Indies at Kanpur in 1994-95. Wisden reports that the pair \"came together requiring 63 from nine overs but their stonewalling defence produced only 16. Though Prabhakar completed an unbeaten century, the selectors dropped him and Mongia from the rest of the series.\" scorecard 5 Mohammad Azharuddin admitted he was paid to fix three one-day games. In one of them, a Titan Cup match against South Africa at Rajkot in 1996-97, he was out for a 23-ball 9 scorecard Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com",

      "body": "<p>The 44th Regus London Film Festival is beginning, or so we were hoping, with stirring power chords, a chest-busting bass line and some big retro-adolescent laughs. The opening film is Cameron Crowe's avowedly semi-autobiographical project about William, a cutely innocent 15-year-old boy in 1973 who flukes his way into going on the road with a rock band and writing about it for Rolling Stone magazine.</p> <p>The imaginary band, Stillwater (a name calculated to evoke half-remembered echoes of real life titans of old), has a charismatic lead guitarist, Russell (Billy Crudup), who takes William under his wing. Then there is the rock journalist Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who in his dishevelled big-brotherish way has kind of taken young William under his wing as well.</p> <p>All of which infuriates William's protective mother, Frances McDormand, who considers that William's place is under her wing. And so it is we are invited to believe that the moral centre of this intensely conservative film is the importance, and the place of, family .</p> <p>This is a very sentimental, low-cal, and oddly humourless account of life on the road with a heavy rock band in the seventies. Forget what you've read by Hunter S Thompson, PJ O'Rourke or indeed Lester Bangs; rock'n'roll is about as decadent as Martha Stewart with all the raunch of an episode of Sesame Street.</p> <p>Sex? We know the legends about jail-bait groupies and mass debauch sessions indulged in by those mega-rock egotists for whom feminism was just a rumour. Almost Famous coyly brushes that stuff under the carpet and primly distinguishes between slut groupies and \"band-aids\" - nice girls who follow the guys around like muses. Sweet hippie rock chick Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) is one such, on whom William naturally nurses a crush.</p> <p>Drugs? No nasty jacking up. Russell has a U certificate acid trip ending with throwing himself into a swimming pool fully clothed. Freaky.</p> <p>Rock'n'roll? Stillwater's music is so dull it had me yearning for the thrills of Wishbone Ash. There are \"band has bad gig\" scenes and \"band has row\" scenes which seem lifted straight from Spinal Tap, but not nearly as plausible or as well acted. And as William, young Patrick Fugit has a pudgy little embryo Tobey Maguire face with that certain sort of perky gormlessness that makes you want to slap him. Almost Famous sucks the energy and danger out of both the music and the journalism of the time, turning it into a nostalgic family-oriented theme park ride.</p> <p>Box office: 020 7928 3232.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The 44th Regus London Film Festival is beginning, or so we were hoping, with stirring power chords, a chest-busting bass line and some big retro-adolescent laughs. The opening film is Cameron Crowe's avowedly semi-autobiographical project about William, a cutely innocent 15-year-old boy in 1973 who flukes his way into going on the road with a rock band and writing about it for Rolling Stone magazine. The imaginary band, Stillwater (a name calculated to evoke half-remembered echoes of real life titans of old), has a charismatic lead guitarist, Russell (Billy Crudup), who takes William under his wing. Then there is the rock journalist Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who in his dishevelled big-brotherish way has kind of taken young William under his wing as well. All of which infuriates William's protective mother, Frances McDormand, who considers that William's place is under her wing. And so it is we are invited to believe that the moral centre of this intensely conservative film is the importance, and the place of, family . This is a very sentimental, low-cal, and oddly humourless account of life on the road with a heavy rock band in the seventies. Forget what you've read by Hunter S Thompson, PJ O'Rourke or indeed Lester Bangs; rock'n'roll is about as decadent as Martha Stewart with all the raunch of an episode of Sesame Street. Sex? We know the legends about jail-bait groupies and mass debauch sessions indulged in by those mega-rock egotists for whom feminism was just a rumour. Almost Famous coyly brushes that stuff under the carpet and primly distinguishes between slut groupies and \"band-aids\" - nice girls who follow the guys around like muses. Sweet hippie rock chick Penny Lane (Kate Hudson) is one such, on whom William naturally nurses a crush. Drugs? No nasty jacking up. Russell has a U certificate acid trip ending with throwing himself into a swimming pool fully clothed. Freaky. Rock'n'roll? Stillwater's music is so dull it had me yearning for the thrills of Wishbone Ash. There are \"band has bad gig\" scenes and \"band has row\" scenes which seem lifted straight from Spinal Tap, but not nearly as plausible or as well acted. And as William, young Patrick Fugit has a pudgy little embryo Tobey Maguire face with that certain sort of perky gormlessness that makes you want to slap him. Almost Famous sucks the energy and danger out of both the music and the journalism of the time, turning it into a nostalgic family-oriented theme park ride. Box office: 020 7928 3232.",

Graham Cook, head of thomascook.com's online partnerships, said: \"We've got a very pro-active partnership strategy and we'll be announcing a whole number of long-term partnerships in the coming months.\" Mr Cook said was in the process of signing up more high-profile partnerships but refused to say whether Lastminute.com was on his list. \"This is the first of the big ones,\" he added. Thomas Cook and QXL reckon they can build the site into the definitive auction portal for travel. QXL members and visitors to thomascook.com will be able to bid as little as \u00a31 on travel deals from JMC and Thomas Cook Holidays. The alliance will come as a blow to Lastminute.com, which has been widely criticised for its dwindling inventory of travel deals. Airtours pulled out of Lastminute.com in the summer and rumours have started circulating that other operators looking to put all their energies into their own online ventures have been thinking of following suit. Thomas Cook subsidiary JMC currently supplies inventory to Lastminute.com while Thomascook.com hasn't yet signed a partnership. Questioned about the logic of partnering with a company facing an uncertain future, Mr Cook said he felt QXL had the best customer service and the strongest b2c auction platform.

And what was his average prior to that hundred?</strong> asks Brian Walsh </p> <p>He didn't make a century until his 27th Test (42nd innings) after his debut in 1985-86. The breakthrough innings came against England at Headingley in the first Test of the 1989 Ashes series: Waugh liked the idea so much that he went on to make 177 not out, then added 152 not out in his next innings, at Lord's. He scored 21 not out in the second innings and 43 in the third Test at Edgbaston - 393 runs between dismissals. Waugh's average before that first century was 30.52, with ten half-centuries. Now he averages a lofty 50.43 - and he's got 22 Test centuries, with at least one against all eight opponents he's played (Australia haven't played Bangladesh yet, of course).</p> <p><strong> Can you please tell me more about a player called John Human? I believe he played Test cricket in the 1930s,</strong> asks Charles Davies-Scourfield </p> <p>John Hanbury Human, who was born in 1912, was a right-hand batsman and legspinner who played for Cambridge University (1932-34) and Middlesex (1935-38). He hit 158 not out on his first-class debut, for Cambridge v HDG Leveson Gower's XI at Eastbourne in 1932, and captained Cambridge University in 1934. He didn't actually play for England, although he did tour Australia and New Zealand in 1935-36 with a strongish MCC team which didn't play any Tests. He died in Sydney in 1991.</p> <p> <strong> Who bowled an 18-ball over against Middlesex in 1982?</strong> asks Jane Herford </p> <p>This was Gladstone Small, the West Indian-born Warwickshire fast bowler who later played for England. The match was played at Coventry, and Small managed to overstep the crease 11 times, and also bowled a wide in the course of one over. (Oddly, the \"Wisden Almanack\" match report doesn't mention this incident.) A fortnight later Small bowled 28 no-balls in 12 overs against Worcestershire.

Five of them happen regularly - bowled, caught, leg before wicket (lbw), run out and stumped. Another, hit wicket, happens less often. Three more are rare enough to get a little section all of their own in the \"Wisden Almanack\" - handled the ball, hit the ball twice, and obstructing the field. And the tenth method hardly ever happens - Timed Out. That's when the incoming batsman wilfully takes more than two minutes to come to the crease.</p> <p> <strong> Can you remind me about Somerset's infamous declaration in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup?</strong> asks Dan Tozer </p> <p>This was a match at Worcester, on 23-24 May, 1979. Somerset were top of their group, and knew they would stay there on strike rate (rate of wickets taken) as long as they did not lose too heavily. So Somerset's captain Brian Rose decided to go against \"all known cricketing principles by deliberately losing the game\", as \"Wisden\" put it. After one over, in which the only score was a no-ball from Van Holder, Somerset declared. Worcestershire passed the total in ten balls, to win by ten wickets. It didn't do Somerset any good: a few days later they were thrown out of the competition for \"bringing the game into disrepute\".</p> <p><strong> Who once scored 322 in less than a day against Warwickshire?</strong> asks Dan Raistrick </p> <p>Another Somerset question: this was the one and only Viv Richards, back in 1985. The match was at Taunton, and started on June 1. Viv came in at No. 4 at a sticky time: opener Paul Bail had retired hurt after being hit on the head, and next man Nigel Felton was out first ball. But Richards wasn't bothered. His first hundred came up in 105 balls, the second in 76, and the third in only 63. In all he batted for 294 minutes and faced 258 balls, and smashed 42 fours and eight sixes, several of them into the River Tone. He was out before the end of the day for 322 (out of 479 while he was in), bowled by Anton \"Yogi\" Ferreira, a South African allrounder, who later scored a century himself as Warwickshire forced a draw.</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is acting editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

      "body": "<p>As the Paralympics closed this week amid widespread acclaim that they, like their sister Olympics, had been the best in history, not all disabled people were celebrating. </p> <p>Bruce Maguire, a blind internet user from Sydney, is bringing a damages claim next week against the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (Socog) for \"humiliation and loss of opportunity to participate\" by failing to make its web site (<a href=\"http://www.olympics.com\">www.olympics.com</a>) accessible to him. </p> <p>Visually impaired internet users and some physically disabled people access information online by converting text into speech or Braille. These methods require accessible web design such as descriptive \"tags\" for images or the provision of text alternatives to graphics files (see panel). </p> <p>Maguire's case will be heard on Monday by the <a href=\"http://www.hreoc.gov.au\">Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission</a>. At a preliminary hearing earlier this year, the commission found that Socog and its technology partner IBM had breached section 24 of the country's disability discrimination act, and should take immediate action to make the Olympics and Paralympics sites accessible. </p> <p>Under advice from IBM, Socog argued that to make the site accessible would cost $A2.2m (\u00a3800,000) and take a year. This was refuted by two web design professionals, brought in by Maguire, who estimated that the site could be fixed in just a few weeks at a fraction of the cost. </p> <p>In the intervening weeks and throughout the games, Socog refused to comply with the ruling, leading to Maguire's new action. Although the commission is not a court, any damages award will be legally enforceable, and Maguire says he is prepared to take the battle all the way to the Federal Court. There is also a possibility that a class action could eventually be brought on behalf of all blind people in Australia. </p> <p>\"I don't think of myself as an activist, but when I encounter this kind of discrimination, I feel I have a responsibility to do something,\" Maguire says. </p> <p>\"I use the web every day - it's a vital tool for many visually impaired people. I tried using the Olympics site several times, without much success, but the worst time was when my son and I had planned to see the fencing. I ended up feeling frustrated and humiliated. In particular, I felt angry and hurt that I was not able to interact with my son in the same way as any sighted parent.\" </p> <p>Both IBM and Socog - a committee of grandees including the lord mayor of Sydney - blame each other for the inaccessibility of the site. </p> <p>At the August hearing, Socog argued that it was IBM's job, as designer and builder of the site, to tackle such issues. This week it was unwilling to comment ahead of the new hearing, but it is understood to be disappointed with the way IBM has sought to divest itself of responsibility. </p> <p>IBM sees it differently. A spokesperson said this week: \"We designed the sites to tight specifications set out by Socog: there was no leeway. All questions of accessibility are down to them.\" </p> <p>But Paul Davis, a web accessibility expert who runs the UK disability portal Ten-20.com , says IBM's assertion is ridiculous. \"Of course they should be advising Socog on accessibility, as they were the technical experts hired to do the job. They'll probably spend more money fighting the case than it would have cost to make the site accessible in the first place.\" </p> <p>And despite some basic remedial work carried out belatedly by IBM, Davis confirmed that the Paralympics site was still entirely inaccessible to blind people. \"It is missing text tags for images, and the Javascript will probably crash any older text readers or speech browsers. Plus the frames may pose problems.\" </p> <p>The case could set an important precedent: recent UK research into the accessibility of online shopping sites by the Royal National Institute for the Blind found that high street names from NatWest bank to Safeway supermarkets were guilty of \"lazy web design and ignorance\", which excluded a potential 8.5 million disabled customers. </p> <p>The charity is now warning UK web designers to take heed of the Australian case or risk similar actions against them under this country's disability discrimination act. </p> <p>The institute's campaigns officer Julie Howell says: \"For the first time, a country has demonstrated that inaccessible web services are discriminatory. Web designers here should think very carefully before making an inaccessible site, as they could find themselves on the wrong side of the law.\" </p> <p> \u0095 The author writes for E-Access Bulletin, a free email newsletter on technology and vision impairment.

Bruce Maguire, a blind internet user from Sydney, is bringing a damages claim next week against the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (Socog) for \"humiliation and loss of opportunity to participate\" by failing to make its web site (www.olympics.com) accessible to him. Visually impaired internet users and some physically disabled people access information online by converting text into speech or Braille. These methods require accessible web design such as descriptive \"tags\" for images or the provision of text alternatives to graphics files (see panel). Maguire's case will be heard on Monday by the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. At a preliminary hearing earlier this year, the commission found that Socog and its technology partner IBM had breached section 24 of the country's disability discrimination act, and should take immediate action to make the Olympics and Paralympics sites accessible. Under advice from IBM, Socog argued that to make the site accessible would cost $A2.2m (\u00a3800,000) and take a year. This was refuted by two web design professionals, brought in by Maguire, who estimated that the site could be fixed in just a few weeks at a fraction of the cost. In the intervening weeks and throughout the games, Socog refused to comply with the ruling, leading to Maguire's new action. Although the commission is not a court, any damages award will be legally enforceable, and Maguire says he is prepared to take the battle all the way to the Federal Court. There is also a possibility that a class action could eventually be brought on behalf of all blind people in Australia. \"I don't think of myself as an activist, but when I encounter this kind of discrimination, I feel I have a responsibility to do something,\" Maguire says. \"I use the web every day - it's a vital tool for many visually impaired people. I tried using the Olympics site several times, without much success, but the worst time was when my son and I had planned to see the fencing. I ended up feeling frustrated and humiliated. In particular, I felt angry and hurt that I was not able to interact with my son in the same way as any sighted parent.\" Both IBM and Socog - a committee of grandees including the lord mayor of Sydney - blame each other for the inaccessibility of the site. At the August hearing, Socog argued that it was IBM's job, as designer and builder of the site, to tackle such issues. This week it was unwilling to comment ahead of the new hearing, but it is understood to be disappointed with the way IBM has sought to divest itself of responsibility. IBM sees it differently. A spokesperson said this week: \"We designed the sites to tight specifications set out by Socog: there was no leeway. All questions of accessibility are down to them.\" But Paul Davis, a web accessibility expert who runs the UK disability portal Ten-20.com , says IBM's assertion is ridiculous. \"Of course they should be advising Socog on accessibility, as they were the technical experts hired to do the job. They'll probably spend more money fighting the case than it would have cost to make the site accessible in the first place.\" And despite some basic remedial work carried out belatedly by IBM, Davis confirmed that the Paralympics site was still entirely inaccessible to blind people. \"It is missing text tags for images, and the Javascript will probably crash any older text readers or speech browsers. Plus the frames may pose problems.\" The case could set an important precedent: recent UK research into the accessibility of online shopping sites by the Royal National Institute for the Blind found that high street names from NatWest bank to Safeway supermarkets were guilty of \"lazy web design and ignorance\", which excluded a potential 8.5 million disabled customers. The charity is now warning UK web designers to take heed of the Australian case or risk similar actions against them under this country's disability discrimination act. The institute's campaigns officer Julie Howell says: \"For the first time, a country has demonstrated that inaccessible web services are discriminatory. Web designers here should think very carefully before making an inaccessible site, as they could find themselves on the wrong side of the law.\" \u0095 The author writes for E-Access Bulletin, a free email newsletter on technology and vision impairment.

He was the last surviving member of the defiant, blacklisted filmmakers nicknamed the Hollywood 10, who refused to cooperate with the House of Un-American Activities Committee in 1947. \u0095 With less than a week till the American elections, Hollywood stars have been coming out in support of their chosen presidential candidate. Al Gore finds Ben Affleck, Whoopi Goldberg and Cher among his backers. They have signed up to join Gore on the campaign trail during this crucial week when Gore and Republican candidate George W Bush are neck and neck. So far action heros Chuck Norris and Charlton Heston have come out in support of Bush, as well as 10 star Bo Derek and country music star Loretta Lynn. Meanwhile Green candidate Ralf Nader has his own fair share of Hollywood lovies. Campaigning on the environmental ticket are Susan Sarandon, Bill Murray and Tim Robbins. \u0095 Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore have signed up to co-star in The Duplex, a comedy about a young couple who have a chance to live in a gorgeous duplex in a very fashionable area of New York. The only problem is that they have to kill the cute old lady who currently lives there. The script has been written by Larry Doyle and Miramax will produce the project. It is not known when production will start. Spiller is currently directing his comedy Zoolander and Barrymore has already signed up to star in the remake of Barbarella. \u0095 Tomb Raider fans: make a note in your diary on November 9, for that is when Paramount will be broadcasting a sneak preview of the new Lara Croft film starring Angelina Jolie, currently in production in London. We are promised a grand tour of the sets, plus an interview with director Simon West. Afterwards you will be able to ask him questions, as well as \"key members of the production staff'\" The whole thing will kick off at 7.30pm on the official Tomb Raider website. \u0095 According to Ain't It Cool, Michael Jackson's plans for his film The Nightmare of Edgar Allen Poe, in which he will play the febrile scribe, are all set to go ahead. Co-producer Gary Pudney revealed \"Michael's not going to look exactly like Poe, but you won't be able to tell the difference between them 10 minutes into the picture. It's going to be absolutely spectacular, full of gruesome goodies and concluding with all the ghosts Poe wrote about coming back to haunt him at the end of his life. We'll also be hiring six to eight other incredible actors... he'll have an acting coach prior to production and during shooting.\" Pudney has also suggested that Jackson is looking to put his singing career on the backburner, as he concentrates on acting. Future projects with Hollywood icons Marlon Brando and Elizabeth Taylor are planned.",

      "body": "<p>Microsoft is in talks with several wireless companies in Britain about developing new internet services for mobile phones. </p> <p>The software group is understood to have held talks with British Telecom and Vodafone about offering mobile services. The initiative is part of its strategy described in September by Paul Gross, senior vice president of Microsoft Mobility, as \"investing in relationships with leading operators, so that together we can enable users to access customised corporate services at any time, any place and from any device\". </p> <p>Rick Belluzzo, group vice president, said that the company was actively pursuing partnerships around the world with mobile phone companies. </p> <p>\"We need to do more in wireless and we need partnerships,\" he told the Guardian. \"We're talking to everybody.\" </p> <p>Microsoft claims to have the biggest internet network in the world with more than 200m users a month in 33 countries, but its services attract just a few million subscribers compared with 25m who pay to use America Online services. </p> <p>In June, Microsoft announced a new internet strategy based on offering integrated services online, which it hopes consumers will subscribe to.

      "bodyText": "Microsoft is in talks with several wireless companies in Britain about developing new internet services for mobile phones. The software group is understood to have held talks with British Telecom and Vodafone about offering mobile services. The initiative is part of its strategy described in September by Paul Gross, senior vice president of Microsoft Mobility, as \"investing in relationships with leading operators, so that together we can enable users to access customised corporate services at any time, any place and from any device\". Rick Belluzzo, group vice president, said that the company was actively pursuing partnerships around the world with mobile phone companies. \"We need to do more in wireless and we need partnerships,\" he told the Guardian. \"We're talking to everybody.\" Microsoft claims to have the biggest internet network in the world with more than 200m users a month in 33 countries, but its services attract just a few million subscribers compared with 25m who pay to use America Online services. In June, Microsoft announced a new internet strategy based on offering integrated services online, which it hopes consumers will subscribe to. To kickstart the consumer end of this strategy, the company launched a global marketing effort expected to cost $1bn over the next year. Its new services will be offered as part of MSN, its consumer website. Wall Street analysts have been sceptical of Microsoft's efforts given the entrenched subscriber base on AOL, but the company has made it clear that it intends to compete aggressively in every web-based market. Mr Belluzzo, who carries two web-enabled phones, said: \"We will take on AOL in every service.\" The Microsoft executive spoke to an audience of investors in Monterey this week to \"underscore the significant transformation of Microsoft\" announced in June. The company is also talking with News Corporation about a possible $1bn investment in Sky Global, the media group's satellite television division. These talks come after Microsoft has spent billions on investing in cable television companies in Europe which compete with Sky for viewers. Mr Belluzzo said this apparently contradictory behaviour made sense in the fledgling market for interactive services as few people knew how the industry was going to develop. \"Everyone is placing bets everywhere,\" he admitted. Mr Belluzzo's presentations to fund managers and analysts in Monterey sought to explain why the company felt that .NET was so important. Microsoft has built its business from selling packaged software from retail shelves. The new strategy will see a shift towards its customers buying such services, from the Office set of calendars and spreadsheets to Encarta, online. The company launched its marketing drive after reaching alliances with content providers such as Disney's children's channel. \"The next few months are going to be about taking our brand and awareness to the next level across the globe.\" His emphasis on the global nature of MSN was designed to underscore the fact that AOL \"is a US play\".

      "body": "<p>Sven-Goran Eriksson was on his way to catch a plane to London by the time Lazio's president Sergio Cragnotti laid down a public challenge to his coach last night. </p> <p>\"We expect people to be professional and to respect their contract to the end,\" he said. \"And when I say the end I mean the end.\" </p> <p>The implication was clear: permission to coach England part-time was out of the question; Eriksson should either devote his energies solely to Lazio until July or leave straight away, an outcome supported by 70% of the club's fans, according to a radio poll. </p> <p>At a press conference in Hertfordshire today the Swede is expected to clarify whether he will indeed slip the leash to coach England part-time for the three pre-July qualifiers. </p> <p>Cragnotti's position in this game of brinkmanship is unambiguous. Yet Eriksson's assistant Tord Grip, who has been released by Lazio to begin his scouting work for England, took a different line. \"It leans toward a compromise, that Sven will get a chance to coach England in the three World Cup qualifiers,\" he said. </p> <p>Amid such confusion it was little wonder that from the bowels of the Olympic stadium before yesterday's Serie A match against Brescia, Eriksson was unsure whether the chanting outside was friendly or hostile. England's football establishment had given its verdict but the 50,000 Romans in the stands had yet to share their thoughts on the new England coach. </p> <p>From the central lower section of the north stand the Ultras fired flares and bellowed their anthem: \"One hundred years together.\" Would the Swede who had brought success be given a hero's welcome or savaged as a defector? The banner headline in the fans' unofficial newsletter was clear: \"Sven's blow below the belt.\" </p> <p>Whistling started the split second he appeared on a giant video screen. Sporadic abuse rippled into jeers as he entered the tunnel. Maybe it was habit, maybe it was good manners, but when he emerged, mobbed by cameramen and blinking in the sunshine, the whistling faded. There was a cheer, albeit a small cheer. </p> <p>A song of joy he has heard for four years wafted from the stands: \"Sven-Goran Eriksson, la la la la.\" Not the most sophisticated lyrics, and without the ardour of old, but rarely did they mean so much. </p> <p>Eriksson stopped, smiled and waved. The message was clear. The crowd was fickle but he would not be thrown to the lions. Not unless he screwed up. </p> <p>Losing to Brescia, just promoted from Serie B and with out their only star, Roberto Baggio, would be a mighty slip-up. In the third minute Brescia scored through a retaken penalty by Dario Hubner. Flares from Brescia's fans cracked in the stands but Eriksson the Quiet, as Romans call him, was exactly that. </p> <p>Salvation arrived in the 34th minute when Simone Inzaghi was pushed in the penalty area and scored from the spot. \"Let the avalanche begin,\" shouted an Ultra, but Lazio lacked the killer instinct of last season. The few chances that were created were fluffed. \"Bring on David Beckham,\" shouted another Ultra. No one laughed. </p> <p>With 14 minutes left Eriksson replaced the midfielder Dejan Stankovic with the former Middlesbrough striker Fabrizio Ravanelli, dumping his beloved 4-4-2 formation in favour of 4-3-3. </p> <p>It worked. Two minutes later Ravanelli struck, Lazio were ahead and Brescia had no way back. It was 2-1 to Lazio and at the end the crowd roared, more in relief than elation, and Eriksson scurried into the tunnel. </p> <p>Roving the stadium corridors, Cragnotti insisted: \"I do not feel betrayed.\" A reporter giggled. \"Really?\" </p> <p>Later, however, Cragnotti said in a live television interview: \"We were prepared to give Eriksson a four- or five-year contract. We wanted to start the Eriksson era. We were very keen to keep him. But it's his choice. It's a life choice.\" </p> <p>But by then Eriksson was on his way to be introduced to England. </p> <p> o You've read the piece, now have your say.

Amid such confusion it was little wonder that from the bowels of the Olympic stadium before yesterday's Serie A match against Brescia, Eriksson was unsure whether the chanting outside was friendly or hostile. England's football establishment had given its verdict but the 50,000 Romans in the stands had yet to share their thoughts on the new England coach. From the central lower section of the north stand the Ultras fired flares and bellowed their anthem: \"One hundred years together.\" Would the Swede who had brought success be given a hero's welcome or savaged as a defector? The banner headline in the fans' unofficial newsletter was clear: \"Sven's blow below the belt.\" Whistling started the split second he appeared on a giant video screen. Sporadic abuse rippled into jeers as he entered the tunnel. Maybe it was habit, maybe it was good manners, but when he emerged, mobbed by cameramen and blinking in the sunshine, the whistling faded. There was a cheer, albeit a small cheer. A song of joy he has heard for four years wafted from the stands: \"Sven-Goran Eriksson, la la la la.\" Not the most sophisticated lyrics, and without the ardour of old, but rarely did they mean so much. Eriksson stopped, smiled and waved. The message was clear. The crowd was fickle but he would not be thrown to the lions. Not unless he screwed up. Losing to Brescia, just promoted from Serie B and with out their only star, Roberto Baggio, would be a mighty slip-up. In the third minute Brescia scored through a retaken penalty by Dario Hubner. Flares from Brescia's fans cracked in the stands but Eriksson the Quiet, as Romans call him, was exactly that. Salvation arrived in the 34th minute when Simone Inzaghi was pushed in the penalty area and scored from the spot. \"Let the avalanche begin,\" shouted an Ultra, but Lazio lacked the killer instinct of last season. The few chances that were created were fluffed. \"Bring on David Beckham,\" shouted another Ultra. No one laughed. With 14 minutes left Eriksson replaced the midfielder Dejan Stankovic with the former Middlesbrough striker Fabrizio Ravanelli, dumping his beloved 4-4-2 formation in favour of 4-3-3. It worked. Two minutes later Ravanelli struck, Lazio were ahead and Brescia had no way back. It was 2-1 to Lazio and at the end the crowd roared, more in relief than elation, and Eriksson scurried into the tunnel. Roving the stadium corridors, Cragnotti insisted: \"I do not feel betrayed.\" A reporter giggled. \"Really?\" Later, however, Cragnotti said in a live television interview: \"We were prepared to give Eriksson a four- or five-year contract. We wanted to start the Eriksson era. We were very keen to keep him. But it's his choice. It's a life choice.\" But by then Eriksson was on his way to be introduced to England. o You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the contingency arrangements being put in place in the event of further blockades of fuel or other essential supplies.</p> <p>The background to these arrangements is the severe disruption to fuel supplies which occurred between 7th and 14th September.</p> <p>Since the protests a large number of meetings with outside bodies have been held by Ministers across Government to discuss the concerns over fuel prices, in particular as they impact on the farming and haulage industries, which are already facing major structural problems. Indeed, prior to the protests there were many such meetings and in the March Budget, as well as ending the fuel duty escalator, in place since 1993, the Chancellor of the Exchequer cut VED (Vehicle Excise Duty) for the haulage industry and for smaller vehicles.</p> <p>In the past few weeks Ministers in various departments have held numerous meetings with organisations campaigning about the high cost of fuel. These include the Road Haulage Association, the Freight Transport Association, the Fuel Forum, the People\u00d5s Fuel Lobby, Farmers for Action and the Disabled Drivers\u00d5 Association. In addition to setting up the Fuel Task Force, we have also held a number of meetings with oil company representatives, the trades unions and representatives of the food and other industries affected by the protests. And Ministers have also visited all the main fuel refineries and depots to talk at first hand to the tanker drivers, company managers, police and others about the lessons to be learned from the protests.</p> <p>As a result, I think that no one can fairly say that we have not made every effort to listen to people\u00d5s concerns, and of course in the days which remain before the Chancellor\u00d5s statement we shall continue to do so.</p> <p>Let me now explain to the House why it is so important to make proper preparations to protect people, industry and services as so far as possible against further disruption.</p> <p>The United Kingdom now has the fourth largest economy in the world. Employment is at record levels and inflation is the lowest in Europe. But, like all modern economies, fundamental changes in the way in which we live and work, and all the just-in-time arrangements, increase our vulnerability to those determined to cause disruption.</p> <p>Whatever the motives of those involved, the disruption which took place in September very nearly caused serious damage to our economy.</p> <p>The British Chamber of Commerce has published details of the effect of the disruption on the commercial activities of its members across the country. For example, in St Helens, they reported that more than a quarter of businesses lost orders, 6 per cent laid off staff and a third predicted a long-term impact on sales. In Peter borough, almost four in ten firms reported they\u00d5d suffered lost sales and 16 per cent had to close temporarily. Many other companies suffered financial problems and lost orders. The British Chambers of Commerce concluded from their research that if the protests had \"persisted for much longer\" they would have caused \"severe damage to many firms from which some would not have recovered\". These conclusions have been endorsed by many others including the TUC and the CBI.</p> <p>Later today I will be placing in the library a report summarising information available to Government departments about the impact of the disruption.</p> <p>The blockades also disrupted essential public services. At some blockades the protestors sought to excuse the impact of the disruption by letting through supplies which they had judged as essential.</p> <p>But there are literally millions of people who perform functions without which the health and other essential services would grind to a halt, from nurses, doctors, hospital receptionists and cleaners to volunteers delivering meals-on wheels, cooks and telephone operators and of course the patients themselves. They all need fuel, yet their needs were barely recognised by those at the terminal gates.</p> <p>It is therefore not from any desire whatever for confrontation, which we still seek to avoid, but because of our responsibilities as a Government to the country as a whole that we must now make preparations to minimise the risk of this happening again.</p> <p>So following the September events, my Rt Hon Friend the Prime Minister asked me to chair a Fuel Task Force to help ensure that Government, industry and others were better prepared to ensure the continuity of supplies for the future.</p> <p>The Task Force included Ministers and representatives from the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales, the police, the oil industry, trades unions and others. It has met on four occasions. Its members first agreed a Memorandum of Understanding, which committed all concerned to work together to ensure continuity of oil supplies. The arrangements include plans to direct fuel supplies to a limited number of designated filling stations and to give priority to essential users. We have upgraded arrangements to ensure that the local authorities and other priority users are better prepared for any future disruption.</p> <p>As I told the House in a written statement last week and as my Rt Hon Friend the Armed Forces Minister repeated on Monday, we have asked the Ministry of Defence to train military drivers to help drive tankers should such assistance prove necessary; but this would be very much as a last resort.</p> <p>Preparations have also been made to help:</p> <p>\u0095 to protect food depots<br> \u0095 to keep major roads open <br> \u0095 and to protect potential targets other than oil terminals.</p> <p>There has of course been a lot of debate as to whether intimidation of drivers took place. It could well be that some drivers were sympathetic to the aims of the protesters</p> <p>Many of those involved in the protests were intent on acting lawfully and peacefully, and did so. Peaceful protest is an important right in any properly functioning democracy. It is a right which I regard as one of my first duties to defend, as do the police.</p> <p>But the behaviour of some of the protestors did create a climate in which the drivers and their managers judged that it was unsafe to allow normal operations to continue.</p> <p>Along with Ministerial colleagues, I have spoken to a large number of the tanker drivers involved. Those I met told me of a real sense of fear that they felt about driving in the face of threats of intimidation and physical attack. I am placing in the Library a detailed log of 180 incidents of intimidation recorded by the oil companies, amended only to avoid identifying publicly the drivers involved. This picture of intimidation is confirmed by the Transport and General Workers\u00d5 Union, whose members form a substantial majority of the drivers concerned.</p> <p>Tactics of intimidation are unacceptable in any circumstances, but particularly so against the driver of an oil tanker in personal charge of many thousands of litres of highly explosive fuel.</p> <p>The police and the oil companies therefore have drawn up detailed plans better to safeguard tanker drivers from the threat of intimidation and better to ensure that the tankers can move freely on to and along the highway. Tanker drivers have the right to go about their daily business in security and safety. Ensuring this is a central aim of our preparations.</p> <p>Mr Speaker, let me repeat again that the last thing this Government wants is any kind of confrontation. There will always be people who hold strong and opposing views on many issues \u00d0 including, today, what to do about oil prices, and the problems affecting farmers, and the difficulties facing the road haulage industry. Peaceful protest can and does play an important role in drawing such concerns to the attention of Government and of Parliament. It is then for we in Government and Parliament to make choices.</p> <p>But I hope the whole House will join me in saying that no one has the right to instigate the kind of disruption that we saw in September \u00d0 and still less to threaten the disruption now being prepared. We have already heard public threats to blockade not only the fuel supply, but also food distribution depots. The consequences of such disruption are obvious \u00d0 and they would hit the weakest and most vulnerable first. There can be no justification for any such action and it is opposed by every employers\u00d5 organisation and trades union and by established hauliers and farmers representatives.</p> <p>Mr Speaker, the measures I have outlined today should ensure that the Government, industry and our health and other public services will be better prepared to cope with the sort of direct action we witnessed in September. But real risks will remain if people persist in protesting in an extreme and irresponsible way. Those now seeking further disruption must understand that the demands they have made could not be met without great damage to jobs and industry, to essential services including the NHS, to pensioners and children. We all have responsibilities.</p> <p>Whatever the supposed Budget surplus \u00d0 and some figures being mooted are wildly exaggerated \u00d0 Government action is necessarily limited in three ways: it must be consistent with keeping interest rates and so mortgages at their present low level; it must not prevent us taking action to support pensioners who also need help; and it must not change the absolutely essential programme of investment in key public services \u00d0 schools, hospitals, transport and the police \u00d0 which the Chancellor announced in July.</p> <p>The right to argue, to complain and to protest is an essential feature of our democratic society. Preventing law-abiding people from going about their business, and threatening the well-being of the country is not. I hope the whole House will join in support of the measures and the approach which I have outlined today.</p> <p><b>Useful link: </b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/petrol\">Special report: petrol war</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the contingency arrangements being put in place in the event of further blockades of fuel or other essential supplies. The background to these arrangements is the severe disruption to fuel supplies which occurred between 7th and 14th September. Since the protests a large number of meetings with outside bodies have been held by Ministers across Government to discuss the concerns over fuel prices, in particular as they impact on the farming and haulage industries, which are already facing major structural problems. Indeed, prior to the protests there were many such meetings and in the March Budget, as well as ending the fuel duty escalator, in place since 1993, the Chancellor of the Exchequer cut VED (Vehicle Excise Duty) for the haulage industry and for smaller vehicles. In the past few weeks Ministers in various departments have held numerous meetings with organisations campaigning about the high cost of fuel.

In addition to setting up the Fuel Task Force, we have also held a number of meetings with oil company representatives, the trades unions and representatives of the food and other industries affected by the protests. And Ministers have also visited all the main fuel refineries and depots to talk at first hand to the tanker drivers, company managers, police and others about the lessons to be learned from the protests. As a result, I think that no one can fairly say that we have not made every effort to listen to people\u00d5s concerns, and of course in the days which remain before the Chancellor\u00d5s statement we shall continue to do so. Let me now explain to the House why it is so important to make proper preparations to protect people, industry and services as so far as possible against further disruption. The United Kingdom now has the fourth largest economy in the world. Employment is at record levels and inflation is the lowest in Europe. But, like all modern economies, fundamental changes in the way in which we live and work, and all the just-in-time arrangements, increase our vulnerability to those determined to cause disruption. Whatever the motives of those involved, the disruption which took place in September very nearly caused serious damage to our economy. The British Chamber of Commerce has published details of the effect of the disruption on the commercial activities of its members across the country. For example, in St Helens, they reported that more than a quarter of businesses lost orders, 6 per cent laid off staff and a third predicted a long-term impact on sales. In Peter borough, almost four in ten firms reported they\u00d5d suffered lost sales and 16 per cent had to close temporarily. Many other companies suffered financial problems and lost orders. The British Chambers of Commerce concluded from their research that if the protests had \"persisted for much longer\" they would have caused \"severe damage to many firms from which some would not have recovered\". These conclusions have been endorsed by many others including the TUC and the CBI. Later today I will be placing in the library a report summarising information available to Government departments about the impact of the disruption. The blockades also disrupted essential public services. At some blockades the protestors sought to excuse the impact of the disruption by letting through supplies which they had judged as essential. But there are literally millions of people who perform functions without which the health and other essential services would grind to a halt, from nurses, doctors, hospital receptionists and cleaners to volunteers delivering meals-on wheels, cooks and telephone operators and of course the patients themselves. They all need fuel, yet their needs were barely recognised by those at the terminal gates. It is therefore not from any desire whatever for confrontation, which we still seek to avoid, but because of our responsibilities as a Government to the country as a whole that we must now make preparations to minimise the risk of this happening again. So following the September events, my Rt Hon Friend the Prime Minister asked me to chair a Fuel Task Force to help ensure that Government, industry and others were better prepared to ensure the continuity of supplies for the future. The Task Force included Ministers and representatives from the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales, the police, the oil industry, trades unions and others. It has met on four occasions. Its members first agreed a Memorandum of Understanding, which committed all concerned to work together to ensure continuity of oil supplies. The arrangements include plans to direct fuel supplies to a limited number of designated filling stations and to give priority to essential users. We have upgraded arrangements to ensure that the local authorities and other priority users are better prepared for any future disruption. As I told the House in a written statement last week and as my Rt Hon Friend the Armed Forces Minister repeated on Monday, we have asked the Ministry of Defence to train military drivers to help drive tankers should such assistance prove necessary; but this would be very much as a last resort. Preparations have also been made to help: \u0095 to protect food depots \u0095 to keep major roads open \u0095 and to protect potential targets other than oil terminals. There has of course been a lot of debate as to whether intimidation of drivers took place. It could well be that some drivers were sympathetic to the aims of the protesters Many of those involved in the protests were intent on acting lawfully and peacefully, and did so. Peaceful protest is an important right in any properly functioning democracy. It is a right which I regard as one of my first duties to defend, as do the police.

Tactics of intimidation are unacceptable in any circumstances, but particularly so against the driver of an oil tanker in personal charge of many thousands of litres of highly explosive fuel. The police and the oil companies therefore have drawn up detailed plans better to safeguard tanker drivers from the threat of intimidation and better to ensure that the tankers can move freely on to and along the highway. Tanker drivers have the right to go about their daily business in security and safety. Ensuring this is a central aim of our preparations. Mr Speaker, let me repeat again that the last thing this Government wants is any kind of confrontation.

It was an unusual sight in a country proud of its open legal system, where television cameras frequently record the wheels of justice in motion. But then the events inside courtroom 14 have been unusual in almost every respect. </p> <p>The handful of spectators who filled the small courtroom every day before Justice Peter Salmon banished the press and public have been treated to a cloak-and-dagger drama worthy of an airport potboiler. Which is fitting enough, because that's precisely what the case is about. In short, it pits a New Zealender who took part in the SAS's botched, and now infamous, Bravo Two Zero raid into Iraq against the might of the British government. Mike Coburn (the pseudonym for the New Zealander) wants to add to the already groaning bookshelf devoted to the escapade; the British government is very keen that he does not. </p> <p>Which all sounds simple enough. Except that it isn't. For the events in court 14 have triggered something far messier. It is a battle over the history of one of the British military's most documented clandestine operations of modern times. At its heart lies the prickly question of who bears responsibility for the mission's spectacular failure: three of the eight-man patrol killed; four captured and tortured by the Iraqis. At least one survivor of the mission has pointed the finger at Vince Phillips, a soldier who died in the operation and who has been accused posthumously of compromising the safety of his comrades. Coburn, meanwhile, has been directing his fire higher, castigating senior SAS officers for issuing the squad with poor equipment and botching their rescue. </p> <p>But these already murky waters are further muddied by other questions. Is it right that one former SAS soldier should be prevented from telling his story when no less than 57 books about the regiment were published between February 1997 and December 1998, 22 of them by \"insiders\"? Is the truth about what really happened in the Iraqi desert being sacrificed at the alter of a mini-indus try that has already turned several former soldiers into rich men? Is it even possible, in this age of saturation news coverage and true-life blockbusters, to keep the workings of a secret military unit secret? And in New Zealand, to these is being added another: is it really the place of a modern democracy to keep the secrets of it's former colonial master? </p> <p>Not all of this would have been instantly apparent from the curious drama that has unfolded in court over the past week. In the witness stand, high-ranking SAS officers and men, flown in from around the world, exchanged Balaclavas and blackened faces for the camouflage shield of a high screen from behind which they gave their evidence. Disembodied British public school voices boomed out from the hidden witness box as men known only as B, or ST, or XY or Z responded to questions with the kind of clipped military precision that assumes instant obedience. The sizeable contingent of reporters following the case has been thoroughly frustrated in its efforts to catch even a glimpse of the procession of secret soldiers. Officials and witnesses for the British Ministry of Defence were smuggled into court via the underground car park and labyrinthine internal stairways and made their entrance through the door normally reserved for use by the judge. </p> <p>The irony is that the Ministry of Defence has spent more than NZ$1m trying to maintain a cloak of secrecy over one of the most extensively documented (not to mention filmed) episodes in the history of the SAS. It is by now common knowledge that the mission began with an eight-man patrol - Bravo Two Zero - being dropped by helicopter deep inside Iraq in January 1991, during the Gulf war. Its mission was to blow up Scud missiles and command-and-control communications lines in western Iraq. Two members of the patrol - Steven Lane and Bob Consiglio - died in firefights; Vince Phillips died in the desert; the other four were captured, and one escaped to Syria. </p> <p>This heroic disaster has spawned a series of bestselling books which have shattered the shield of official secrecy surrounding the SAS. It has also exploded the myth of ruthless efficiency and absolute loyalty surrounding the regiment whose badge caries the motto, \"Who Dares Wins\". </p> <p>The first member of the patrol to go into print was Andy McNab, a pseudonym of its leader. His book, Bravo Two Zero, made him a fortune. It has sold 1.5m copies and has been translated into 16 languages. </p> <p>It was followed soon after by The One That Got Away, from Chris Ryan. He described how he walked 200 miles across the desert for eight days without food and water. He also criticised McNab for being less than entirely frank and questioned Phillips' ability, claiming he was reluctant to go on the mission. </p> <p>Last month, Peter Radcliffe - the real name of the SAS regimental sergeant major in the Gulf at the time - weighed into the controversy with a his own tome, which attacked both earlier books about the mission. </p> <p>Coburn, pseudonym of the New Zealander called Mark the Kiwi in McNab's book, criticises senior SAS officers and accuses Ryan of blackening the name of Phillips. Yesterday, Ryan responded, maintaining that Phillips was a professional soldier but was let down by senior officers who, Ryan says, should not have picked him for the mission. </p> <p>Ryan also accuses the SAS of double standards. He says he was forced to give his own story to General Sir Peter de la Billiere, chief of British land forces during the Gulf war and a former SAS commanding officer. It is an exaggeration, perhaps, but there is enough evidence to back up his case. De la Billiere's own book on the war, Storm Command, published in 1992, was the first detailed account of the campaign, including Bravo Two Zero's hitherto secret mission. </p> <p>It was clear de la Billiere had spoken to the surviving members of the patrol: \"The superhuman courage and endurance of one soldier, whom I will call Corporal Chris X... make an amazing story and one which perfectly exemplifies the spirit and traditions of the SAS.\" De la Billiere continued with a tantalising 15 pages on the episode. The green light for McNab, not to say Ryan, could not have been clearer. </p> <p>Coburn revealed to the Auckland court that de la Billiere invited the five surviving members of Bravo Two Zero to a Christmas dinner in 1992, in the company of the general's literary agent. It was clear, said Coburn, that the meal was arranged to seek their help in a second de la Billiere book devoted entirely to the SAS patrol's mission. </p> <p>This will not endear de la Billiere to the current SAS establishment which banned him from regimental functions in response to Storm Command. De la Billiere said through his publisher yesterday: \"I've said my bit.\" </p> <p>Coburn has not. This week, he accused senior officers of issuing the patrol with faulty equipment, dropping it too close to enemy lines, and delaying a rescue attempt because the men were \"expendable\". He added: \"The vast majority of reasons for Bravo Two Zero's failure lay not with the patrol but with the regimental hierarchy. Those failures resulted in the deaths of three men... As the regiment's then CO is now director of Special Forces, it is not too difficult to see why it is not in his interest for the details in Soldier 5 (Coburn's book) to be subjected to further scrutiny\". </p> <p>Signals equipment failed, and the patrol was given the wrong radio frequency. Coburn also claimed that they were told by their commander on their return they were lucky not to have been court-martialled. \"It seemed incredible after all we had been through,\" said Coburn. </p> <p>McNab and other former SAS commandos have been weighing in this week, attacking Ryan and praising Coburn. In his book, Radcliffe attacks members of the patrol for disregarding orders, rejecting advice that they should take a vehicle with them, and ignoring instructions to escape, not west or north, but south to Saudi Arabia. No wonder, he says, RAF and US rescue helicopters could not find them. </p> <p>Radcliffe accuses members of Bravo Two Zero of gratuitous exaggeration. \"As far as I'm concerned,\" he writes, the truth is sensational enough without anyone having to embellish it. </p> <p>As the feud between the survivors escalated, a leaked classified SAS report concluded that Sergeant Vince Phillips was \"difficult to work with\" and \"lacked the will to survive\". The report, which fell into the hands of the Mail on Sunday, claims that Phillips fell asleep on watch, compromised the operation by getting up and moving about when the others were hiding from a goatherd, and that his \"heart was simply not in the task\". </p> <p>Coburn, 36, has told the Auckland court he wants to restore Phillips' reputation and give any profits from his book to the sergeant's family. </p> <p>As the government made its case to keep his book off the shelves in Auckland, a former director of Britain's special forces, identified only as XY, told the court that Coburn's book would do \"massive harm\". </p> <p>Terrorist organisations, international drug cartels and foreign intelligence services had used books by insiders to build up \"an incremental understanding\"of secret SAS techniques, he claimed. \"The SAS's work is of vital importance to national security - their operations must remain discreet and disclosure inhibits their ability to complete their task,\" he added. </p> <p>Perhaps XY came closer to the real reason behind the attempt by the MoD to suppress Coburn's book. \"If this book is published it will breach the principle of confidentiality contracts,\" he said. Yet the books written by McNab and Ryan were cleared by the MoD before publication, so why get at Coburn? The official answer is that Coburn signed a contract forcing his silence when he was still serving in the SAS - the others did not. </p> <p>For the MoD it is a test case on which its whole culture of secrecy depends. If Coburn is allowed to go ahead and publish, what message will that give to others, including Stella Rimington, the former head of MI5 who wants to publish her memoirs? Yet even if Coburn loses in the Auckland court, the sweeping nature of the MoD's \"confidentiality contracts\" are almost certainly incompatible with the Human Rights Act. </p> <p>The MoD, it seems, will not learn. Despite the many books written about the SAS and the extent of the publicity given to SAS operations - many with unofficial MoD approval - it still tries to put the finger in the dyke. </p> <p>In New Zealand, meanwhile, public opinion is swinging in behind the local lad. There's an increasing resentment over what is perceived as the New Zealand authorities kowtowing to the mandarins of Whitehall and loaded phrases such as \"the British military establishment\" have been slipping into coverage of the case. Whether or not Coburn is allowed to go ahead and publish his book, enough has come out in court to undermine the whole purpose of the exercise, reminiscent of the Thatcher government's futile attempt to suppress Spycatcher, the memoirs of the former MI5 officer Peter Wright .\"The MoD has decided on a high-risk strategy,\" a senior Whitehall figure close to the intelligence world put it yesterday, \"at the moment it's not paying off.\"</p>",

Thus, users who want to find the site for their local McDonald's will be asked whether they are seeking an address for head office; a restaurant or customer services. Mr Mitchell, who resigned as managing director of AltaVista UK in August, said WebTop offers a different service to Autonomy, the software firm which uses similar technology in its Kenjin application. \"Autonomy goes for the corporate market, but our target is business to consumer operations. We can restructure how the web is presented within your portal and to your customers,\" he added. WebTop will license the service to commercial portals, allowing customers to search the web without leaving the site. The company will also generate revenue through sharing advertising income from the search engine. Bright Station, which has developed WebTop, also owns the SmartLogiK knowledge management solution, which it plans to float on the stockmarket early next year. The company bought the technology assets of the failed online clothes retailer boo.com in June, which have been folded into its Sparza subsidiary. Mr Mitchell confirmed plans to spin off WebTop, with an announcement expected soon.",

      "body": "<p>Jackson Evans and Josiah Bartlet have raised no campaign funds, addressed no meetings, hired no consultants and aired not a single ad in the US presidential election. Yet both of these leading Americans have helped to shape the Gore-Bush contest, and both will have a home in the White House irrespective of the result of Tuesday's vote. That's because they are fictional presidents. </p> <p>The two men are presidents in, respectively, the latest Hollywood White House movie, The Contender, and the award-winning television drama series The West Wing. Presidents Evans and Bartlet have other things in common. Both are pragmatic but liberal-leaning Democrats. They are Hollywood-handsome guys. They are dignified but know how to relax and relate. They are capable of taking stands on matters of principle. And neither of them has ever had an affair with a White House intern. </p> <p>Evans and Bartlet are examples of the Democratic presidents that Hollywood liberals would like the US to have had in recent years. They are Clinton without the naughty bits. Both men exemplify America's love affair with the platonic presidency. </p> <p>The West Wing offers a vision of the Clinton administration as it might have been without Monica Lewinsky and Ken Starr. Aaron Sorkin's weekly scripts invite Americans to see President Bartlet and his staff as warm-hearted political professionals whose moral consciences remain alive and close to the surface at all times. They constantly wrestle behind the scenes with the rights and wrongs of the policies and tactics of White House life. The fundamental theme of the series is that this administration is populated by nice people, with whose sense of decency we can all identify. </p> <p>\"He's the president we would all love to have,\" says Peter Rollins, a film historian at Oklahoma State University. \"There's so little back-biting in his White House. These are people who really care. They are the leaders we crave. Character is not one theme - it's the theme. It's clearly propaganda for the Democrats.\" </p> <p>Bartlet is played by Martin Sheen, who has plenty of White House experience, having played JFK for television as well as Michael Douglas's chief of staff in Rob Reiner's movie The American President. Sheen has also been drumming up support for Al Gore in California and Washington over the past month. \"I'm the acting president,\" Sheen recently joked on a TV talk show. </p> <p>Just as it is impossible to watch The West Wing without thinking of Clinton, so it's hard not to see something of the real president in Rob Lurie's new movie The Contender. President Jackson Evans, played by Jeff Bridges, has many things in common with Clinton. Evans is nearing the end of two terms in the White House and is preoccupied with ensuring his legacy. Fate intervenes when the vice-president dies, providing the president with the opportunity to nominate Senator Laine Hanson (played by Joan Allen) to be America's first woman vice-president. </p> <p>Hanson is the central figure in the movie, which concerns the ruthless attempts by a Gingrich-style Republican congressman (Gary Oldman) to block her nomination by fair means or, for the most part, foul. As in The West Wing, the president remains slightly remote from the narrative, though Bridges manages superbly to convey a richly complicated Clintonesque character who is sexy, charming and folksy yet ruthless and pragmatic. </p> <p>Though one senses that President Evans might very easily respond if a curvaceous intern flashed her thong at him, this president puts his reputation firmly on the line for sexual equality rather than sexual gratification. His climactic moment is purely oratorical, as he calls on Congress to stand by his choice of Hanson and thus renew the American dream. </p> <p>It's a moment of purest hooey, accompanied by lush strings, and Oldman has denounced Hollywood studio chiefs for allegedly re-cutting the movie to make it more propagandist than Lurie intended. Oldman says that DreamWorks bosses Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg (bigtime Democrats all) forced Lurie to edit the movie to mesh with Al Gore's election agenda. </p> <p>Although that claim is only partly credible, Oldman is on to something. The film is a piece of propaganda. </p> <p>The Contender, like The West Wing, is part of the increasingly freewheeling re-creation of the ennobled presidency for the entertainment age. For most of the 20th century, Hollywood made movies about real presidents in preference to purely fictional ones (notable exceptions being Gabriel Over the White House, in 1933, and Doctor Strangelove). Abraham Lincoln was a particular favourite, and Washington, Wilson, both Roosevelts and JFK (in the 1963 Cliff Robertson movie PT109) were the subjects of heroic biopics. </p> <p>All this began to change with Richard Nixon, Vietnam and Watergate. Nixon has of course featured in a significant list of films - notably All the President's Men, Oliver Stone's Nixon and last year's brilliant minor classic Dick. But his legacy to the movies - and to American public life - is even richer. He exposed his own misdeeds so blatantly that even the most starry-eyed idealists had no alternative but to see the dark side of the presidency. </p> <p>From the late 1960s the biopic was pretty much dead. But the need to venerate the presidency and the president is rooted deep within the American psyche. No other advanced nation outside the totalitarian world has such a compelling need to revere its political leaders. So Hollywood has played an increasingly important role in supplying the collective need for heroic and principled presidents. </p> <p>For many Americans, including himself, Ronald Reagan created a presidency that was an unprecedented mixture of fact and fiction.

      "bodyText": "Jackson Evans and Josiah Bartlet have raised no campaign funds, addressed no meetings, hired no consultants and aired not a single ad in the US presidential election. Yet both of these leading Americans have helped to shape the Gore-Bush contest, and both will have a home in the White House irrespective of the result of Tuesday's vote. That's because they are fictional presidents. The two men are presidents in, respectively, the latest Hollywood White House movie, The Contender, and the award-winning television drama series The West Wing. Presidents Evans and Bartlet have other things in common. Both are pragmatic but liberal-leaning Democrats. They are Hollywood-handsome guys. They are dignified but know how to relax and relate. They are capable of taking stands on matters of principle. And neither of them has ever had an affair with a White House intern. Evans and Bartlet are examples of the Democratic presidents that Hollywood liberals would like the US to have had in recent years. They are Clinton without the naughty bits. Both men exemplify America's love affair with the platonic presidency. The West Wing offers a vision of the Clinton administration as it might have been without Monica Lewinsky and Ken Starr. Aaron Sorkin's weekly scripts invite Americans to see President Bartlet and his staff as warm-hearted political professionals whose moral consciences remain alive and close to the surface at all times. They constantly wrestle behind the scenes with the rights and wrongs of the policies and tactics of White House life. The fundamental theme of the series is that this administration is populated by nice people, with whose sense of decency we can all identify. \"He's the president we would all love to have,\" says Peter Rollins, a film historian at Oklahoma State University. \"There's so little back-biting in his White House. These are people who really care. They are the leaders we crave. Character is not one theme - it's the theme. It's clearly propaganda for the Democrats.\" Bartlet is played by Martin Sheen, who has plenty of White House experience, having played JFK for television as well as Michael Douglas's chief of staff in Rob Reiner's movie The American President. Sheen has also been drumming up support for Al Gore in California and Washington over the past month. \"I'm the acting president,\" Sheen recently joked on a TV talk show. Just as it is impossible to watch The West Wing without thinking of Clinton, so it's hard not to see something of the real president in Rob Lurie's new movie The Contender. President Jackson Evans, played by Jeff Bridges, has many things in common with Clinton. Evans is nearing the end of two terms in the White House and is preoccupied with ensuring his legacy. Fate intervenes when the vice-president dies, providing the president with the opportunity to nominate Senator Laine Hanson (played by Joan Allen) to be America's first woman vice-president. Hanson is the central figure in the movie, which concerns the ruthless attempts by a Gingrich-style Republican congressman (Gary Oldman) to block her nomination by fair means or, for the most part, foul. As in The West Wing, the president remains slightly remote from the narrative, though Bridges manages superbly to convey a richly complicated Clintonesque character who is sexy, charming and folksy yet ruthless and pragmatic. Though one senses that President Evans might very easily respond if a curvaceous intern flashed her thong at him, this president puts his reputation firmly on the line for sexual equality rather than sexual gratification. His climactic moment is purely oratorical, as he calls on Congress to stand by his choice of Hanson and thus renew the American dream. It's a moment of purest hooey, accompanied by lush strings, and Oldman has denounced Hollywood studio chiefs for allegedly re-cutting the movie to make it more propagandist than Lurie intended. Oldman says that DreamWorks bosses Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg (bigtime Democrats all) forced Lurie to edit the movie to mesh with Al Gore's election agenda. Although that claim is only partly credible, Oldman is on to something. The film is a piece of propaganda. The Contender, like The West Wing, is part of the increasingly freewheeling re-creation of the ennobled presidency for the entertainment age. For most of the 20th century, Hollywood made movies about real presidents in preference to purely fictional ones (notable exceptions being Gabriel Over the White House, in 1933, and Doctor Strangelove). Abraham Lincoln was a particular favourite, and Washington, Wilson, both Roosevelts and JFK (in the 1963 Cliff Robertson movie PT109) were the subjects of heroic biopics. All this began to change with Richard Nixon, Vietnam and Watergate. Nixon has of course featured in a significant list of films - notably All the President's Men, Oliver Stone's Nixon and last year's brilliant minor classic Dick. But his legacy to the movies - and to American public life - is even richer. He exposed his own misdeeds so blatantly that even the most starry-eyed idealists had no alternative but to see the dark side of the presidency. From the late 1960s the biopic was pretty much dead. But the need to venerate the presidency and the president is rooted deep within the American psyche. No other advanced nation outside the totalitarian world has such a compelling need to revere its political leaders. So Hollywood has played an increasingly important role in supplying the collective need for heroic and principled presidents. For many Americans, including himself, Ronald Reagan created a presidency that was an unprecedented mixture of fact and fiction. If Reagan was frequently unable to tell the difference between real life and the movies, it is not surprising that Americans would blur the distinctions too. Clinton's presidency has seen a remarkable acceleration of this process. With the exception of Nixon, real presidents no longer feature on the Hollywood agenda. Imaginary presidents, on the other hand, are now so thick on the ground that they are the subject of academic books and conferences, including one that Peter Rollins is helping to organise just after the real election. Broadly speaking, presidential movies fall into two categories. There are those that depict the president as a man of action, such as Independence Day, in which the president destroys an alien invasion, and Air Force One, where Harrison Ford performs spectacular heroics to recapture his plane from a group of terrorist hijackers led by Gary Oldman (again). Then there are those that depict him as a man of wisdom and judgment, a benign if worldly embodiment of a nation at peace with itself. The West Wing, The Contender and The American President fall into this category. In each of these categories the president is manifestly Un-Clinton in one way or another. The presidential action movies compensate for Clinton's lack of a military past and Vietnam draft evasion. The feelgood domestic presidential movies compensate for Clinton's sexual dalliances and the trauma of his impeachment.

Some policy ideas, such as the working families tax credit, have been taken straight off Mr Clinton's shelf.</p> <p>The president's emphasis on centrist, inclusive politics has more than an echo in Mr Blair's third way. Mr Clinton's campaigning tactics, and his reliance on focus groups to track public opinion, have been aped by both Labour and the Tories.</p> <p>Mr Blair memorably stuck up for Mr Clinton during a visit to Washington at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Mr Clinton has reciprocated in his tireless support for Mr Blair's efforts to achieve a lasting constitutional settlement in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>By way of contrast, Mr Blair and Mr Bush have never met. Indeed, the Texas governor has only ever made three trips outside the US, apart from visits to Mexico.</p> <p>Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, is a more familiar figure in Britain. But while offering more in the way of policy continuity, even a Gore administration would not be immune to unilateralist or neo-isolationist trends within America - especially if Congress remains under Republican majority control.</p> <p>Mr Bush's ardent support for the deployment of a national missile defence (NMD), designed to protect the US from \"rogue states\", is a prime area of concern for Britain.</p> <p>Although Mr Bush has suggested extending such a missile shield to protect Britain and Europe, NMD is essentially a policy that puts US interests first, risks a new arms race with Russia and China, and potentially undermines the Nato concept of collective security.</p> <p>When Condoleezza Rice, Mr Bush's foreign policy adviser, recently suggested that a Bush administration would pull US troops out of Kosovo and Bosnia, similar concerns were expressed.</p> <p>Such a unilateral pullout would call into question Nato unity of purpose, as well as risking the democratic gains in the Balkans that have been achieved since last year's Kosovo intervention.</p> <p>These considerations only compound existing strains caused by EU efforts to create a separate European defence identity, backed by a nascent European army reserve. Both Mr Gore and Mr Bush have doubts about this project which some in Washington see as a French plot to undermine US influence in Europe.</p> <p>Britain's policy of \"critical engagement\" with problematic regimes, pioneered by foreign secretary Robin Cook, is another source of possible future friction with both Mr Gore and Mr Bush.</p> <p>Britain's attempts to repair diplomatic bridges with Iran, Libya, Cuba and North Korea have often run ahead of US policy.</p> <p>The two countries take very different views of relations with Cuba, for example. The US maintains a strict embargo.

      "bodyText": "The imminent end of the Clinton era carries serious foreign policy implications for Britain, particularly if the Republican candidate, George W Bush, is victorious next Tuesday. Tony Blair and New Labour have maintained close links with Bill Clinton and the new Democrats. Some policy ideas, such as the working families tax credit, have been taken straight off Mr Clinton's shelf. The president's emphasis on centrist, inclusive politics has more than an echo in Mr Blair's third way. Mr Clinton's campaigning tactics, and his reliance on focus groups to track public opinion, have been aped by both Labour and the Tories. Mr Blair memorably stuck up for Mr Clinton during a visit to Washington at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Mr Clinton has reciprocated in his tireless support for Mr Blair's efforts to achieve a lasting constitutional settlement in Northern Ireland. By way of contrast, Mr Blair and Mr Bush have never met. Indeed, the Texas governor has only ever made three trips outside the US, apart from visits to Mexico. Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, is a more familiar figure in Britain. But while offering more in the way of policy continuity, even a Gore administration would not be immune to unilateralist or neo-isolationist trends within America - especially if Congress remains under Republican majority control. Mr Bush's ardent support for the deployment of a national missile defence (NMD), designed to protect the US from \"rogue states\", is a prime area of concern for Britain. Although Mr Bush has suggested extending such a missile shield to protect Britain and Europe, NMD is essentially a policy that puts US interests first, risks a new arms race with Russia and China, and potentially undermines the Nato concept of collective security. When Condoleezza Rice, Mr Bush's foreign policy adviser, recently suggested that a Bush administration would pull US troops out of Kosovo and Bosnia, similar concerns were expressed. Such a unilateral pullout would call into question Nato unity of purpose, as well as risking the democratic gains in the Balkans that have been achieved since last year's Kosovo intervention. These considerations only compound existing strains caused by EU efforts to create a separate European defence identity, backed by a nascent European army reserve. Both Mr Gore and Mr Bush have doubts about this project which some in Washington see as a French plot to undermine US influence in Europe. Britain's policy of \"critical engagement\" with problematic regimes, pioneered by foreign secretary Robin Cook, is another source of possible future friction with both Mr Gore and Mr Bush. Britain's attempts to repair diplomatic bridges with Iran, Libya, Cuba and North Korea have often run ahead of US policy. The two countries take very different views of relations with Cuba, for example. The US maintains a strict embargo. Britain is in favour of normalisation and, only this week, sent a trade delegation to Havana led by a junior minister. While Britain is a keen supporter of the United Nations, and especially its international peacekeeping role, Mr Bush is deeply sceptical - while Mr Gore could scarcely be called enthusiastic. Mr Bush argues against unilateral or US military intervention in world troublespots unless justified by overriding US national security interests. He does not, for example, believe that a repeat of the 1994 Rwanda genocide would justify direct US action. Contrast this with Britain's policy in Sierra Leone, where a substantial military commitment has been made in support of the UN peacekeeping force and nation-building. The Clinton-Gore administration refused to get involved there. Both Mr Gore and Mr Bush reject the idea of placing US troops under UN command. The failure of US mediation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will not bring any change in approach from either Mr Gore or Mr Bush. Although many Arab countries believe the US is biased towards Israel, Washington is likely to resist any attempt by Britain or the EU to replace it as the leading peace intermediary. Other areas of potential friction include ongoing US trade disputes with the EU (which have brought sanctions against British exports), the creation of a rule-based trading system that is fair to developing countries, efforts to curb weapons proliferation, the UN's proposed international criminal court, and America's disinclination to fully support international environmental agreements like the Kyoto accord. On all these issues, both Mr Gore and Mr Bush are likely to espouse positions that do not concur with those of Britain. Perhaps most worryingly of all for Mr Blair, the change of leadership in Washington that could lead to a weakening of the \"special relationship\" with the US comes at a time when Britain is also at odds with its EU partners over fundamental questions such as the euro and greater European integration. Which, in a worst case scenario, leaves the United Kingdom all alone in the North Sea, caught between two stools and with declining influence all round.

Military drivers are being trained to drive petrol tankers. Earlier today, Tory leader William Hague accused the government of creating a \"climate of anxiety\" over fuel protests. He also urged protesters not to allow themselves to be provoked by the government's tough tactics, warning that they would lose public support if they broke the law or caused disruption on a massive scale. \"The government are making the situation worse by talking so much about bringing in the Army and by holding the pre-Budget statement so close to the 60-day deadline - they could have had it already and ended the uncertainty - and by talking about stockpiling fuel,\" said Mr Hague. Mr Straw said the government action on fuel duties was limited by the need to keep interest rates at their present low levels, the need to support pensioners, and the need to preserve essential investment in key public services.

      "bodyText": "What difference has the internet made to our lives? Spend a few days in Silicon Valley and the answer seems all-pervasive. The web has changed the way that people work, communicate and speak with each other in the area of the world that adopted it earlier and more enthusiastically than any other. If you take away the wealth created by the internet and the widespread obsession with the stock market (difficult, even after the recent downturn), you are still left with a society that cannot imagine a time spent completely offline. While Silicon Valley provides a welter of anecdotal evidence about the influence of the web, academic researchers are increasingly looking at what the web has meant to the rest of the US and the world. The first annual study of how the web influences the way Americans behave has just been released by the centre for communication policy at the University of California in Los Angeles. The report, based on interviews with a cross-section of more than 2,000 people, is a work-in-progress. Broad rather than focused, it aims to provide a snapshot of a nation at the start of a revolution that its authors believe \"could equal the influence of the printing press\". The study, Surveying the Digital Future, is funded by some of the world's largest technology companies as well as non-profit research foundations. One founder of a media website said that, when his company suffered an electricity blackout last week, his employees wandered around unable to think what to do. \"I had to point out that they could still use the phones,\" he said. More and more public places, from lifts to train stations, provide real-time news updates on electronic screens to city dwellers that turn to handheld computers for maps and timetables and traffic updates. The internet has also changed the way people speak when they do communicate verbally. Valleyspeak is a whole new dialect. \"To aim\" is no longer just an alternative verb for strive, for example. It now means to communicate through instant messaging in the same way that Hoover came to mean vacuum to an earlier generation. Jeffrey Cole, who is behind the report, said that he expects 15 other countries to carry out a similar study next year, including the UK. The founder of the World Internet Project, Mr Cole is looking for a British university to mastermind a domestic study. As a diverse array of countries start domestic studies, the first postcard from the US edge provides an interesting glimpse into what the web has already done. What it has not yet achieved is universal coverage. While Silicon Valley represents the perfect demographic mix for internet users - white, male and urban - it is not representative of the nation as a whole. Some 32% of the study participants had no access to the internet at all. More than half of these (many over 45) said they had no plans to get connected any time soon. The rest said they wanted access but had no computer at home and the new technology was too expensive. The study makes a positive comment about this divide between the technological haves and have-nots by pointing out that it took television 46 years to reach two-thirds of US households, compared with seven for the fast-moving web. One of the most surprising findings in the survey is the element of common ground between the views of constant internet users and the non-users. Both groups - from those who proclaimed themselves unable to live without the web to those who had no desire to live with it - shared a common mistrust of the technology. Some 64% of regular users and even more non-users cited the lack of privacy as their biggest single concern, with credit card fraud coming second. \"The extraordinary degree of concern over privacy and credit card information goes across all levels,\" says Cole. \"That's surprising.\" Specifically, Americans are worried about how and why companies are gathering information about them and what they are doing with that information. Other recent surveys have also underscored the fact that the usual concerns about an overzealous big brother government have been replaced by fears about money-grubbing businesses and a lack of security. Cole believes that increased familiarity will ease some of these concerns over time. What is clear is that the extent of the concerns could hinder the sorts of ambitions for the web that would make it both an international passport and wallet.

Britain sits at the top of the UN list of national businesses investing overseas, but also shows an inexorable increase in foreign ownership of British enterprises, 10% of it, last year, being German. Around 9,000 UK companies are owned by Americans. The British accept this with nonchalance. When BMW swallowed Rover, the only political concern was about preserving jobs.

Superbly contemptuous of the notion that a Europe-owned City could diminish our national identity, we think Brussels will destroy it.

But these do not fully encompass the emotional turbulence of British opinion, which has as much to do with heart as mind, with viscera as neurones. The insouciance that enables Brits to ride over every assault on their economic heartland seems entirely to desert them in face of any adjustment, however minor, resulting from our 27-year membership of the EU.</p> <p>The contrast, I suggest, is between substance and symbol. Substance we can evidently sign away, as long as the economics add up. This is not always a reliable test, by the way. The BMW takeover of Rover ended in tears, and foreign-owned banks may survive a recession less readily than if British interests still controlled them. But we blithely swallow that. Symbol, on the other hand, must be defended at all costs. The part of Britain/England the EU mainly threatens are her symbols not her substance.</p> <p>Passports are a symbol.

Mr Cordone quoted an Israeli official as telling Amnesty that forces had been on a virtual war footing since the flare-up began, and that investigations into deaths at the hands of Israeli forces had been called off. One of only two cases being looked into was that of a Palestinian boy, whose death in his father's arms was captured by the world's media. Amnesty called for an independent inquiry into the crisis in order to study individual cases of human rights abuses and bring the guilty to justice. \"There is a pattern of gross human rights violations that may well amount to war crimes,\" Mr Cordone said. He urged both sides to react to attacks with proportionate force, saying Israeli troops had appeared to move from firing tear gas to live rounds too quickly. \"If a kid is throwing stones at you, but is not putting any lives at risk, then you do not shoot him,\" he said.

Yesterday the shares climbed 5p to 285p. </p> <p>The company has issued successive profit warnings and a subsequent takeover approach from Infogrames of France was abandoned last month after lengthy discussions.

      "bodyText": "Eidos, the troubled computer games publisher, yesterday lost its second director in a matter of weeks when chief executive Charles Cornwall announced his intention to quit. Michael McGarvey, who will step up from chief operating officer to take Mr Cornwall's place, said his departure had been a mutual decision. \"There was no boardroom scuffle and neither was this out of the blue,\" Mr McGarvey said. \"This is a management succession from the kind of entreprenerial attitude needed to get the business off the blocks to a more strategic and focused approach.\" Eidos, which owns the popular Tomb Raider franchise featuring Lara Croft, has suffered a turbulent 12 months during which its share price has plunged from a peak of \u00a312 last year. Yesterday the shares climbed 5p to 285p. The company has issued successive profit warnings and a subsequent takeover approach from Infogrames of France was abandoned last month after lengthy discussions. Jeremy Lewis, chief financial officer at Eidos, left the company three weeks ago. Eidos has not been helped by weak market conditions, with game players waiting for the next generation of consoles to hit the shops before spending cash on new titles. Mr McGarvey yesterday warned Eidos's fortunes were unlikely to show much improvement until the next financial year. \"In the short term it is very difficult to put your finger on what the market will do and conditions will remain challenging for the balance of the financial year,\" he said. \"Next April to March 2002 will provide the platform for growth.\" Mr Cornwall, who was on a six month contract, first raised his intention to leave at the start of the year and will not receive a pay-off. But he will keep options worth around \u00a31.8m at current share prices. Mr Cornwall in effect engineered the creation of Eidos in its present shape through the merger of a series of small technology companies during the mid-1990s. He had been a director of the business since 1993, prior to which he was a corporate financier at Chartered West LB. In a statement Mr Cornwall said he intended to devote more time to his other technology and mining interests in the US and South Africa. Julian Morse, a games analyst at broker Beeson Gregory, said Eidos could be ready to turn the corner, and changed his stance from hold to buy. \"The stock has come back a long way because there has been a lack of investor confidence.

      "bodyText": "Channel 4, having withdrawn its media rights offer of \u00a3250m in the summer because racing \"could not get its act together\", yesterday made a joint submission with BSkyB and Arena worth a projected \u00a3750m over 10 years. The \"Go Racing\" consortium formed by the three companies has offered the Racecourse Association a guaranteed \u00a3400m (\u00a380m for marketing) with \u00a350m guaranteed in cash in year one. But the real strength and attraction of the offer resides in a share of revenue generated through worldwide TV and internet betting which is expected to be in excess of \u00a3750m. With a rival offer from Carlton worth \u00a3400m, plus possible extra revenue of \u00a3150m from global income having already been made but not taken up by the RCA, this new submission seems to be favourite. Channel 4 are very keen to win this contract, but in the official statement yesterday said they \"will make no assurances of continued racing coverage outside this proposal\". This means they will not cooperate with Carlton in their bid, as was suggested in some quarters, and that if the consortium's bid is not accepted then racing will be off Channel 4 screens for the foreseeable future. The BBC are included in the \"Go Racing\" offer and will be able to buy the rights to their existing portfolio of racing coverage, worth at the moment around \u00a37m per year. Television coverage, particularly the mass audiences brought to the sport by the terrestrial stations, is widely agreed to be crucial to the health of racing and research by the British Horseracing Board shows that betting turnover increases by over 230% when it is televised. The \"Go Racing\" offer promises 4,000 hours of racing coverage each year, which is more than any other sport receives in this country. There will be a dedicated Go Racing channel produced by Channel 4 and running nine hours a day, seven days a week, with four to six races per hour. There will be an interactive TV service including on-screen betting, a comprehensive website allowing international betting on UK racing, more meetings from the less fashionable tracks on terrestrial TV, a daily lunchtime racing programme on Channel 4 and improved coverage on Sky Sports with 60 programmes a year. David Brook, Channel 4's director of strategy, said: \"The consortium can demonstrate a long-term commitment to British horseracing that our rivals cannot begin to match.

      "body": "<p>The difficulties of persuading ministers to appear on current affairs programmes have been well documented. With the exception of that man for all programmes, the endlessly versatile and incessantly available John Prescott, it sometimes seems that cabinet ministers have taken a vow of silence. Or a vow, at least, never to submit to questioning on Newsnight, nor on The World at One, nor, unless great tragedy or triumph beckons, on the Today programme.</p> <p>This elusiveness, Alastair Campbell explained, in the days before he too disappeared from view, was because our ministers are very busy men. \"Given the remarkable expansion in BBC programmes it would not be impossible for ministers to spend their entire time at 4 Millbank answering interview requests, and none at all doing their job,\" he wrote to the Times in 1998, when Tony Blair was first accused of preferring a nice bit of anecdotage on a comfy sofa to being asked a series of connected questions about his government. \"Of course this means we can pick and choose, and we do,\" Campbell continued. \"Very few people - in politics or the media - take The World at One seriously, so such regular appearances are less likely. Newsnight is on late, with a dwindling audience.\"</p> <p>On the other hand, the great communicator pointed out, appearances on daytime chat shows introduced ministers to \"millions of people, many of whom do not follow politics closely, and it is important that elected politicians continue to find ways of engaging them in the political process.\" This reasoning, or something like it, must explain why those two very busy men, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland and the prime minister, both appeared on BBC2 last Saturday, being interviewed on a programme made by and for children called Pass the Mic.</p> <p>If they were hoping to reach an audience which does not follow politics closely, then the pair could not, if you discount Tweenies, have chosen better. So unpolitical were these young programme makers, that they decided to approach Mandelson and Blair as visiting celebrities: the former arrived on the set by crashing through a paper screen, followed a few minutes later (and through a fresh piece of paper), by his dog, a golden retriever called Bobby, \"Bobs\" for short. In the circumstances, it might have been something of an anticlimax to learn that this ebullient dog-cuddler was the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, and so we duly didn't.</p> <p>\"First off Peter, what do you think of the set?\" Peter liked it. He liked the chairs, too. And the company. \"I think the best interviewers are those who are very relaxed, charming, not confrontational, not going at you hammer and tongs,\" he confided, \"because an interviewer who just, you know, beats up on you the whole time, you just go back like that [he mimed timorous recoil]; you're immediately very careful about what you say, the shutters go down, the drawbridge comes up, and you just want to survive and you don't actually want to say very much.\"</p> <p>Here on Pass the Mic, Mandelson said, it was different. \"You're so laid back and you are so relaxed that you made me relaxed myself, and you've made me say all sorts of unguarded things that I wouldn't normally do.\"</p> <p>No doubt the spurned presenters of Newsnight and The World at One will want to study Pass the Mic's technique: child presenters, little props and surprises, lots of irreverence tinged with a very real, human sympathy. There was a fake moustache, which Mandelson gamely put on: \"Don't you think I look younger than I did in the 1980s?\" A copy of Peter Rabbit (for whom Mandelson was named) was flourished. \"You know what my middle name is, don't you?\" In the end, Pass the Mic viewers were left in no doubt that the real \"Peter\" is a warm and playful animal-lover whose Machiavellian reputation can only have been invented by the vicious, grown-up media.</p> <p>His buddy, Tony, to whom he chose to Pass the Mic, was almost, but not quite as polished in his guilelessness, confiding that while his sons were into music, his daughter favoured Pok\u00e9mon. Sensibly, perhaps, neither minister spoiled the celebrity joshing with tedious allusions to current politics, nor did the children feel any duty to pipe up with Blue Peterish inquiries about the prospects for world peace or retirement homes for dolphins. The aim, so far as one could be discerned, was not to interest teenagers in politics but to flatter their indifference.</p> <p>This was a striking joint prostration, even for an administration which has always been eager to ingratiate itself with the under-16s, to the point of crashing a three-year-old's birthday party, referring to something called a \"Euan test\", and in Blair's case, acknowledging his oldest son as a source of political enlightenment: \"I had never heard my boy talk about politics before, ever, and suddenly he got on to the environment.\"</p> <p>Only last month, the government used a poem by an 11-year-old to alert the nation to the merits of the Human Rights Act. \"I am not very old/But I think I understand/How the new Human Rights Act/Would work throughout the land.</p> <p>I am quite old, but I think I understand how sucking up to 11-year-olds might work throughout the land. If there is something in all the reports about the proliferation of \"kidults\", those unwieldy, 35-ish, Harry Potter-reading, Stuart Little-watching, trainer-wearing scooter riders who feel no shame in sharing a hobby with Po from the Teletubbies, then perhaps there are kidult voters, too, who want kidult politicians who understand about PlayStations.</p> <p>Even if the arrival of this type has been overstated by label-loving journalists, there is persuasive evidence that children are now directing their parents' choice of food and homes, cars and holidays. Maybe, if Blair and Mandelson succeed in impressing the audiences of Pass the Mic and similar teen rallies, the children will ordain a parental vote for the party of Pok\u00e9mon-aware pet-lovers, the pester-power politicians. Let's just hope they never get to hear Blair's views on the loving slap.</p> <p><b>Who will protect our peeresses?</b></p> <p>The appointment of Sir Thomas More, the keen heretic burner, as the patron saint of politicians has had a mixed reception, but the pontiff's choice of saint is surely less dismaying than the revelation that politicians have never until now had a martyr to call their own. According to Catholic Online, which boasts \"the largest collection of facts and information concerning Saints and Angels on the Internet\", virtually every profession - many of them much more despised than politics - already has a saint to call upon for help or intercession.</p> <p>Journalists, for instance, benefit from the guidance of Francis de Sales. Advertisers and accountants, lawyers and cab drivers - each guild has its dedicated saint or seraphim. Even arms dealers have their own protector: Adrian of Nicomedia.

      "bodyText": "The difficulties of persuading ministers to appear on current affairs programmes have been well documented. With the exception of that man for all programmes, the endlessly versatile and incessantly available John Prescott, it sometimes seems that cabinet ministers have taken a vow of silence. Or a vow, at least, never to submit to questioning on Newsnight, nor on The World at One, nor, unless great tragedy or triumph beckons, on the Today programme. This elusiveness, Alastair Campbell explained, in the days before he too disappeared from view, was because our ministers are very busy men. \"Given the remarkable expansion in BBC programmes it would not be impossible for ministers to spend their entire time at 4 Millbank answering interview requests, and none at all doing their job,\" he wrote to the Times in 1998, when Tony Blair was first accused of preferring a nice bit of anecdotage on a comfy sofa to being asked a series of connected questions about his government. \"Of course this means we can pick and choose, and we do,\" Campbell continued. \"Very few people - in politics or the media - take The World at One seriously, so such regular appearances are less likely. Newsnight is on late, with a dwindling audience.\" On the other hand, the great communicator pointed out, appearances on daytime chat shows introduced ministers to \"millions of people, many of whom do not follow politics closely, and it is important that elected politicians continue to find ways of engaging them in the political process.\" This reasoning, or something like it, must explain why those two very busy men, the secretary of state for Northern Ireland and the prime minister, both appeared on BBC2 last Saturday, being interviewed on a programme made by and for children called Pass the Mic. If they were hoping to reach an audience which does not follow politics closely, then the pair could not, if you discount Tweenies, have chosen better. So unpolitical were these young programme makers, that they decided to approach Mandelson and Blair as visiting celebrities: the former arrived on the set by crashing through a paper screen, followed a few minutes later (and through a fresh piece of paper), by his dog, a golden retriever called Bobby, \"Bobs\" for short. In the circumstances, it might have been something of an anticlimax to learn that this ebullient dog-cuddler was the secretary of state for Northern Ireland, and so we duly didn't. \"First off Peter, what do you think of the set?\" Peter liked it. He liked the chairs, too. And the company. \"I think the best interviewers are those who are very relaxed, charming, not confrontational, not going at you hammer and tongs,\" he confided, \"because an interviewer who just, you know, beats up on you the whole time, you just go back like that [he mimed timorous recoil]; you're immediately very careful about what you say, the shutters go down, the drawbridge comes up, and you just want to survive and you don't actually want to say very much.\" Here on Pass the Mic, Mandelson said, it was different. \"You're so laid back and you are so relaxed that you made me relaxed myself, and you've made me say all sorts of unguarded things that I wouldn't normally do.\" No doubt the spurned presenters of Newsnight and The World at One will want to study Pass the Mic's technique: child presenters, little props and surprises, lots of irreverence tinged with a very real, human sympathy. There was a fake moustache, which Mandelson gamely put on: \"Don't you think I look younger than I did in the 1980s?\" A copy of Peter Rabbit (for whom Mandelson was named) was flourished. \"You know what my middle name is, don't you?\" In the end, Pass the Mic viewers were left in no doubt that the real \"Peter\" is a warm and playful animal-lover whose Machiavellian reputation can only have been invented by the vicious, grown-up media. His buddy, Tony, to whom he chose to Pass the Mic, was almost, but not quite as polished in his guilelessness, confiding that while his sons were into music, his daughter favoured Pok\u00e9mon. Sensibly, perhaps, neither minister spoiled the celebrity joshing with tedious allusions to current politics, nor did the children feel any duty to pipe up with Blue Peterish inquiries about the prospects for world peace or retirement homes for dolphins. The aim, so far as one could be discerned, was not to interest teenagers in politics but to flatter their indifference. This was a striking joint prostration, even for an administration which has always been eager to ingratiate itself with the under-16s, to the point of crashing a three-year-old's birthday party, referring to something called a \"Euan test\", and in Blair's case, acknowledging his oldest son as a source of political enlightenment: \"I had never heard my boy talk about politics before, ever, and suddenly he got on to the environment.\" Only last month, the government used a poem by an 11-year-old to alert the nation to the merits of the Human Rights Act. \"I am not very old/But I think I understand/How the new Human Rights Act/Would work throughout the land. I am quite old, but I think I understand how sucking up to 11-year-olds might work throughout the land. If there is something in all the reports about the proliferation of \"kidults\", those unwieldy, 35-ish, Harry Potter-reading, Stuart Little-watching, trainer-wearing scooter riders who feel no shame in sharing a hobby with Po from the Teletubbies, then perhaps there are kidult voters, too, who want kidult politicians who understand about PlayStations. Even if the arrival of this type has been overstated by label-loving journalists, there is persuasive evidence that children are now directing their parents' choice of food and homes, cars and holidays. Maybe, if Blair and Mandelson succeed in impressing the audiences of Pass the Mic and similar teen rallies, the children will ordain a parental vote for the party of Pok\u00e9mon-aware pet-lovers, the pester-power politicians. Let's just hope they never get to hear Blair's views on the loving slap. Who will protect our peeresses? The appointment of Sir Thomas More, the keen heretic burner, as the patron saint of politicians has had a mixed reception, but the pontiff's choice of saint is surely less dismaying than the revelation that politicians have never until now had a martyr to call their own. According to Catholic Online, which boasts \"the largest collection of facts and information concerning Saints and Angels on the Internet\", virtually every profession - many of them much more despised than politics - already has a saint to call upon for help or intercession. Journalists, for instance, benefit from the guidance of Francis de Sales. Advertisers and accountants, lawyers and cab drivers - each guild has its dedicated saint or seraphim. Even arms dealers have their own protector: Adrian of Nicomedia. Moving up the evolutionary scale, geese have been allotted Martin of Tours (not, admittedly, that he has been a conspicuous success in the job). And yet, until this week, politicians were on their own. This could explain a lot, couldn't it? Everything from the choice between Gore and Bush to the disappointing turnout at the last European elections; from the shrivelling of the Commons to the existence of William Hague. Still, miracles can happen. Some already believe that the simultaneous appointment of a Catholic speaker and a new patron saint of politicians is more than just a coincidence. But if the spiritual renewal of Westminster as a whole is to be accomplished it will require another patron saint to intercede on behalf of the Labour peeresses, that stern sorority whose high calling must needs set them apart from temporary, elected politicians. Although the most obvious candidate for the job, Baroness Margaret Jay, is regrettably ineligible, being not formally canonised, there is no shortage of choice. Inevitably most of the more impressive candidates have already been bagged by other professions, but it would be a pity if this stopped the baronesses considering St Ferdinand III of Castile, the patron saint of rulers, or Saint Anne, the patron saint of good housekeeping. Or my final suggestion, St Michael the Archangel, who being both \"one of the chief princes\" and the heavily armed patron saint of paratroopers, would seem to be the ideal entity to take Blackstone's battalion under his wing.",

      "bodyText": "France called for tight European controls on shipping yesterday after dangerous chemicals began leaking from the tanker Ievoli-Sun, the day after she sank off Alderney with a 6000 tonne cargo. President Jacques Chirac went to Cherbourg to talk to marine officials, after being told that the Italian registered Ievoli-Sun was barely seaworthy before she left Fawley, Hampshire, for Yugoslavia. Earlier President Chirac had called Romano Prodi, the president of the European commission, and other European Union leaders to demand rapid introduction of severe new controls, including a ban on single hull tankers. While he was at the French port, a minesweeper that had located the ship was taken out of the area and other shipping warned to stay clear because of a risk that leaking styrene could explode. The Ievoli-Sun, lying upside down in about 90 metres of water, had a large hole in the hull which had opened while she was being towed on Tuesday. The sinking, less than a year after the fuel tanker Erika went down and caused hundreds of miles of pollution along the French coast, has exposed serious faults in inspection procedures. The French transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot,said that if reforms promised after the Erika disaster had been in place now the Ievoli-Sun \"would have been banished from the seas\". However, according to the minister, Italy and Greece had opposed the changes. Although the Italian ship was only 10 years old, there have been a number of reports that she was poorly maintained. The captain of the tugboat Abeille-Flandres, who went aboard, said the ship was rusty and in poor condition. His opinion confirmed other reports, including an official inspection in Holland on October 26, after the ship was detained in the port of Moerdijk for four days because of problems with watertight doors and the electrical circuit. This was the third time she had been stopped in Dutch ports because of her suspect condition. The Dutch said faults were repaired before the Ievoli-Sun left for Fawley, after being chartered by Shell and Exxon-Mobil to carry chemicals to Bar in Yugoslavia. But France has asked Italy for explanations on the Ievoli-Sun's record and the inspections by the Rina verification company in Italy, which also gave a seaworthiness certificate to the Maltese-registered Erika. The Erika was given a fairly high mark for safety by Rina, which was much more critical of the state of the Ievoli-Sun. French authorities have been told that the Naples-based tanker, which belongs to a family-owned fleet, only just scraped through a seaworthiness test despite lengthy repairs. Greenpeace's French spokesman, Bruno Rebelle, criticised the French government, which holds the European presidency, for not rushing through reforms which would automatically ban ships that had twice failed inspectionprocedures. \"France and Europe are stuck between attempts to improve security and the need to maintain a competitive fleet,\" he said.",

He said these issues of social dislocation were \"eating people's souls\".</p> <p>The government needed to address the disaffection of the young by rebalancing the curriculum, increasing parental responsibility, and spreading prosperity. The important task was to reignite youth's interest in education, he suggested, referring to the recent film: \"Not everyone could become a Billy Elliot, but the government needs to do more to provide after school clubs and vocational education.\"</p> <p>Mandelson is one of a series of Labour election strategists who have admitted the government is struggling to find a \"vocabulary of achievement\" that does not alienate voters.</p> <p>Giving the Herbert Morrison lecture at Westminster, Mr Mandelson (a grandson of the postwar Labour home secretary) admitted that his party was going through \"testing times\", since the size of the government's majority had inflated expectations as to the speed with which it could deliver on its commitments.</p> <p>\"The truth is that a massive majority does not actually make solving the problems of the NHS easier or quicker, it merely means there are fewer tight votes in the Commons\", he said.</p> <p>The party had learned lessons about government, \"about the balance of listening and leading, about the need not to over-claim, about the great potential but also the impatience of the British people. And the constant conversation we need to keep having with the public, in language that makes an emotional and not just a political connection between government and governed.\"</p> <p>However, he said, there was only one question that mattered: \"Why was it that, after 1945, a great Labour government that achieved so much in its first term, failed to meet the challenge of renewal and allowed its huge majority to melt away and be followed by 13 years of Tory rule? And how can we be sure to avoid the same fate?</p> <p>\"Competent implementation of a victorious manifesto is a necessary but not sufficient condition for future success. We have to keep thinking and re-thinking our ideas. We have to hatch new policies, bold strokes and forward positions that keep us ahead of the times\".</p> <p>He said lack of social cohesion and fear of crime in cities was one great issue to address in the second term - theft, intimidation, abuse, vandalism or burglary. \"It is what people are talking about - either because they are experiencing it, or hearing about it, or reading about it. And it is eating into their souls.\"</p>",

Himself sometimes called the King of Spin, the Northern Ireland secretary conceded that, in New Labour's early days in power, \"the enthusiasm of our rhetoric did not help\". \"Not yet chastened by the sheer hard work and grind of government, we were all a bit guilty of letting some of our sense of the possible get out of sync with the pace of change on the ground.\" But, he said, the recent poll recovery would continue so long as the party renewed itself and adopted a more ambitious second term manifesto, one that addressed the breakdown in social cohesion and the fear of crime. He said these issues of social dislocation were \"eating people's souls\". The government needed to address the disaffection of the young by rebalancing the curriculum, increasing parental responsibility, and spreading prosperity. The important task was to reignite youth's interest in education, he suggested, referring to the recent film: \"Not everyone could become a Billy Elliot, but the government needs to do more to provide after school clubs and vocational education.\" Mandelson is one of a series of Labour election strategists who have admitted the government is struggling to find a \"vocabulary of achievement\" that does not alienate voters. Giving the Herbert Morrison lecture at Westminster, Mr Mandelson (a grandson of the postwar Labour home secretary) admitted that his party was going through \"testing times\", since the size of the government's majority had inflated expectations as to the speed with which it could deliver on its commitments. \"The truth is that a massive majority does not actually make solving the problems of the NHS easier or quicker, it merely means there are fewer tight votes in the Commons\", he said. The party had learned lessons about government, \"about the balance of listening and leading, about the need not to over-claim, about the great potential but also the impatience of the British people. And the constant conversation we need to keep having with the public, in language that makes an emotional and not just a political connection between government and governed.\" However, he said, there was only one question that mattered: \"Why was it that, after 1945, a great Labour government that achieved so much in its first term, failed to meet the challenge of renewal and allowed its huge majority to melt away and be followed by 13 years of Tory rule? And how can we be sure to avoid the same fate? \"Competent implementation of a victorious manifesto is a necessary but not sufficient condition for future success. We have to keep thinking and re-thinking our ideas. We have to hatch new policies, bold strokes and forward positions that keep us ahead of the times\". He said lack of social cohesion and fear of crime in cities was one great issue to address in the second term - theft, intimidation, abuse, vandalism or burglary. \"It is what people are talking about - either because they are experiencing it, or hearing about it, or reading about it. And it is eating into their souls.\"",

In fact, where Clinton was concerned, they got a divorce.</p> <p>Now, the same separation of job performance and character lies at the heart of the 2000 race for US president. Voters agree with Gore, but they like Bush. They would rather have Gore's policies but Bush's character.

After Carter's incompetence and weakness, they wanted decisiveness and direction and voted for Ronald Reagan.</p> <p>The negative parts of the Clinton legacy, his scandals, leave Americans wanting a man of character, judgment, maturity, and an almost disinterested integrity. They find it in George W Bush.</p> <p>Gore, sullied by association with Clinton and crippled by a stunning inability to convey his innate warmth and wit over the camera, falls wide of the mark.</p> <p>Yet it is the positive aspects of Clinton's record, his successes more than his failures, that drive the voters into the arms of Bush. If crime were skyrocketing, unemployment high, inflation looming, a budget deficit crippling the economy, then voters would want a man with whom they would agree on these momentous issues. It is the very achievements of Clinton that leave them uninterested in what would otherwise be burning issues like crime, welfare, fiscal policies, foreign affairs, and social programmes.</p> <p>Ungrateful for Clinton's accomplishments and unforgiving of his failures, Americans want the opposite of Bill Clinton for their next president. If he was a good president but a bad man, they want a good man to succeed him and they are not terribly worried about whether or not he will make a good president.</p> <p>In deciding to stick with Clinton through scandal, America's head triumphed over its heart.

If they began to feel he had let them down they drew negative conclusions about him politically as well as personally. But, beginning with the Clinton impeachment proceedings, these two ideas - job performance and personal integrity - became separate. In fact, where Clinton was concerned, they got a divorce. Now, the same separation of job performance and character lies at the heart of the 2000 race for US president. Voters agree with Gore, but they like Bush. They would rather have Gore's policies but Bush's character. While the vice-president echoes their views, the Republican candidate elicits their admiration, affection, and trust. Every nation's politics marches to the beat of its own recent experience. After Richard Nixon's scandals, Americans wanted integrity above all else and voted for Jimmy Carter. After Carter's incompetence and weakness, they wanted decisiveness and direction and voted for Ronald Reagan. The negative parts of the Clinton legacy, his scandals, leave Americans wanting a man of character, judgment, maturity, and an almost disinterested integrity. They find it in George W Bush. Gore, sullied by association with Clinton and crippled by a stunning inability to convey his innate warmth and wit over the camera, falls wide of the mark. Yet it is the positive aspects of Clinton's record, his successes more than his failures, that drive the voters into the arms of Bush. If crime were skyrocketing, unemployment high, inflation looming, a budget deficit crippling the economy, then voters would want a man with whom they would agree on these momentous issues. It is the very achievements of Clinton that leave them uninterested in what would otherwise be burning issues like crime, welfare, fiscal policies, foreign affairs, and social programmes. Ungrateful for Clinton's accomplishments and unforgiving of his failures, Americans want the opposite of Bill Clinton for their next president. If he was a good president but a bad man, they want a good man to succeed him and they are not terribly worried about whether or not he will make a good president. In deciding to stick with Clinton through scandal, America's head triumphed over its heart. In backing Bush and rejecting Gore, the heart is winning the day. Dick Morris was chief strategist for President Clinton in his successful 1996 bid for re-election. He is head of www.vote.co.uk www.vote.co.uk",

The composites manufacturing plant in Derby, which makes glass fibre and carbon fibre jet engine parts, will close by the middle of next year. </p> <p>Rolls announced that the work will be contracted out to Austrian firm Fischer Advanced Composite Components. The move is expected to save \u00a33m a year for the next five years. </p> <p> <strong>Luminar opens 40 new clubs</strong></p> <p> Luminar, the nightclub operator which doubled in size with the acqusition of Northern Leisure in the summer, is planning to open 40 new outlets next year. Expansion plans were announced yesterday following a trebling in pre-tax profits from \u00a34.3m to \u00a313.2m which sent the share price racing to 695p, up 30p.</p> <p><strong>Axa loses court round</strong></p> <p> The Consumers' Association yesterday won the first round of its legal battle against insurance group Axa's plans for dividing up \u00a31.7bn in surplus cash. </p> <p>The association said the insurer was not offering its 660,000 policyholders a fair share of the so-called \"orphan assets\", and yesterday the high court ruled that Axa should pay \u00a3100,000 costs so that policyholder Stuart MacWhirter's challenge can be properly heard in court. </p> <p>The association has been helping Mr MacWhirter, a chartered accountant in London, to take his case to court after he objected to the way Axa is planning to distribute the surplus money.</p> <p><strong>Lynx errors found</strong></p> <p> Shares in British financial software firm Lynx Group were hit yesterday after the company said it had uncovered accounting errors and issued a profits warning. It expects to make not less than \u00a310.5m profit compared with \u00a311m last year. Analysts had been expecting profits of \u00a310.8m to \u00a312.3m for the year to September 30. </p> <p>The company said the \u00a310.5m figure did not include \u00a35m in accounting errors in its Value Added Distribution business. The division's finance director resigned after the company uncovered the mistake which went on for a number of years. </p> <p>Lynx shares ended up 0.5p at 111.5p after pulling back from large early falls.</p> <p><strong>Centrica buys Avalanche</strong></p> <p> Centrica, the ever-expanding energy, home and roadside services group, paid \u00a3114.5m for Canada's Avalanche Energy. </p> <p>In August the group became the latest British utility to seek greater earnings outside the sway of British regulators by buying Direct Energy in Calgary for \u00a3406m. </p> <p>Avalanche, a small, independent producer, owns fields in Alberta, accounting for 90% of its assets. Most of the gas is uncontracted, giving Centrica direct access. </p> <p>The acquisition, due to be completed by the end of this month, brings Centrica close to its target of owning 20% of the gas it supplies to its Canadian customers.</p>",

Rolls announced that the work will be contracted out to Austrian firm Fischer Advanced Composite Components. The move is expected to save \u00a33m a year for the next five years. Luminar opens 40 new clubs Luminar, the nightclub operator which doubled in size with the acqusition of Northern Leisure in the summer, is planning to open 40 new outlets next year. Expansion plans were announced yesterday following a trebling in pre-tax profits from \u00a34.3m to \u00a313.2m which sent the share price racing to 695p, up 30p. Axa loses court round The Consumers' Association yesterday won the first round of its legal battle against insurance group Axa's plans for dividing up \u00a31.7bn in surplus cash. The association said the insurer was not offering its 660,000 policyholders a fair share of the so-called \"orphan assets\", and yesterday the high court ruled that Axa should pay \u00a3100,000 costs so that policyholder Stuart MacWhirter's challenge can be properly heard in court. The association has been helping Mr MacWhirter, a chartered accountant in London, to take his case to court after he objected to the way Axa is planning to distribute the surplus money. Lynx errors found Shares in British financial software firm Lynx Group were hit yesterday after the company said it had uncovered accounting errors and issued a profits warning. It expects to make not less than \u00a310.5m profit compared with \u00a311m last year. Analysts had been expecting profits of \u00a310.8m to \u00a312.3m for the year to September 30. The company said the \u00a310.5m figure did not include \u00a35m in accounting errors in its Value Added Distribution business. The division's finance director resigned after the company uncovered the mistake which went on for a number of years. Lynx shares ended up 0.5p at 111.5p after pulling back from large early falls. Centrica buys Avalanche Centrica, the ever-expanding energy, home and roadside services group, paid \u00a3114.5m for Canada's Avalanche Energy. In August the group became the latest British utility to seek greater earnings outside the sway of British regulators by buying Direct Energy in Calgary for \u00a3406m. Avalanche, a small, independent producer, owns fields in Alberta, accounting for 90% of its assets. Most of the gas is uncontracted, giving Centrica direct access. The acquisition, due to be completed by the end of this month, brings Centrica close to its target of owning 20% of the gas it supplies to its Canadian customers.",

Accusing ministers of a \"deafening silence\" over their initial plans to curb directors' excessive pay, David Gould, head of investment services at the national association of pension funds, NAPF, said it could be as late as 2003 before they were implemented. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary - who once raised the prospect of directors being forced to stand for re-election every year - is now understood to favour a much milder measure to ensure shareholder control over boardroom remuneration. Giving the government's long awaited response to an 18-month consultation period in the new year, he is expected to abandon a once favoured option of forcing a vote each year at annual company meetings on their remuneration committee reports. Legislation has been ruled out of December's shortened Queen's speech to placate industry and the City before the general election. Amid signs of cabinet splits on the issue, Mr Byers is instead likely to favour measures to shorten the notice period - now six weeks - for shareholders to table resolutions at annual meetings. Industry sources said this could involve pre-publication of reports on firms' websites, enabling shareholders to see remuneration committee reports early and table critical resolutions. Mr Byers' friends think this will achieve the same effect as forcing annual shareholder votes but Mr Gould rebutted this, saying firms were under no legal obligation to publish remuneration reports annually. Ministers have been encouraged by evidence such as the shareholders' revolt against a \u00a310m package to Vodafone's Chris Gent to believe the campaign against boardroom excess has borne fruit. \"When we started hardly anybody turned up for annual meeting votes,\" one Whitehall source said.

Flora Bravina, a 50-year-old paediatrician and longtime opponent of Serbian rule in Kosovo, was released on the orders of the Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica. She was arrested by Serbian police in Kosovo during last year's Nato bombing campaign and transferred to prison in Serbia when Yugoslav forces withdrew from the province. \"Justice has been served,\" said Mrs Bravina's lawyer, Branko Stanic, as she was driven out of a women's prison in Pozarevac. The order for her release was brought to the prison by the president's own legal adviser, Filip Golubovic. In December last year, Mrs Bravina was charged with terrorism and sentenced to 12 years in prison, based on what the court alleged were links between her and the Kosovo Liberation Army. That sentence was quashed by the Serbian supreme court earlier this summer. A new trial was ordered and was due to take place on November 16. The campaign for the release of Mrs Bravina and hundreds of other political prisoners has dominated the political debate in Kosovo over the last year, and President Kostunica has been under pressure from the west to free them. Some prisoners were released while Slobodan Milosevic was still in power, but hopes of more progress on the issue were raised when Mr Kostunica took over. Kosovo's three leading Albanian parties mentioned the issue of prisoners in their first response to the political changes in Belgrade.

Initially the prisoners' status was linked to progress on finding around 1,000 Serbs who went missing in Kosovo during and after the war. The head of the UN Mission in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, welcomed Mrs Bravina's release, adding that she had been \"sorely missed\" and that she should never have been sentenced to jail. He also urged Mr Kostunica to go further and ensure the release of the remaining political prisoners. That, he said, \"would be a major stride towards meaningful dialogue and...peace\". Mrs Bravina had earlier told her family that she would not leave jail unless her fellow inmates were released too. This prompted concern among some of the new Yugoslav government's advisers. The US and British governments have called for all political prisoners to be set free.",

      "body": "<p>British companies are experiencing a \"climate of anxiety\" over their role in the e-commerce revolution, according to research published yesterday. </p> <p>A survey of 300 companies of different sizes and across a range of industries found that fewer than half (46%) were pursuing, or had implemented, an e-commerce plan. Of this minority, 84% had their own website but only 2% used the site for online transactions, according to E-Business Review magazine. </p> <p>David Bicknell, the magazine's managing editor, said: \"It is clear that UK plc lacks confidence about its preparations for the e-economy. </p> <p>\"Our research suggests that perhaps the main constraining factors are still the lack of skilled individuals to make e-business in the UK happen and a general lack of knowledge. Until we have a genned-up, e-skilled workforce, the climate of anxiety about moving forward will continue to grow.\" </p> <p>The survey also found that 31% of executives responsible for e-commerce felt their companies had been losing interest in the internet and were falling behind rivals. Only 22% felt they were ahead of competitors. </p> <p>In focus group research, banks, building societies and retail chains were among businesses which confessed to soft pedalling on e-commerce. They were still monitoring their websites, and the broader online market, rather than offering transactions over the web or linking up key partners or suppliers, the research showed. </p> <p>Some organisations added that e-business was now low on their corporate priority list. </p> <p>Among the concerns voiced were difficulties in acquiring and keeping skilled staff, problems integrating websites with established departments and the marketing costs of a high-profile web presence. </p> <p>Some firms had experienced difficulties after leaving online strategy to their marketing departments, with IT personnel given responsibility only for implementation. </p> <p>But Martha Bennett, vice-president of research in Europe for Giga Information Group, said that the pendulum swing away from e-commerce belied the business opportunities still available on the web. </p> <p>\"There is a golden opportunity right now, especially for existing companies that have perhaps been a bit slow in adapting to the internet,\" she said. \"It is the perfect time for them to recruit the much needed technical staff and get their websites working for them. </p> <p>\"We need to get out of the mind set of thinking about on and off-line companies.

      "bodyText": "British companies are experiencing a \"climate of anxiety\" over their role in the e-commerce revolution, according to research published yesterday. A survey of 300 companies of different sizes and across a range of industries found that fewer than half (46%) were pursuing, or had implemented, an e-commerce plan. Of this minority, 84% had their own website but only 2% used the site for online transactions, according to E-Business Review magazine. David Bicknell, the magazine's managing editor, said: \"It is clear that UK plc lacks confidence about its preparations for the e-economy. \"Our research suggests that perhaps the main constraining factors are still the lack of skilled individuals to make e-business in the UK happen and a general lack of knowledge. Until we have a genned-up, e-skilled workforce, the climate of anxiety about moving forward will continue to grow.\" The survey also found that 31% of executives responsible for e-commerce felt their companies had been losing interest in the internet and were falling behind rivals. Only 22% felt they were ahead of competitors. In focus group research, banks, building societies and retail chains were among businesses which confessed to soft pedalling on e-commerce. They were still monitoring their websites, and the broader online market, rather than offering transactions over the web or linking up key partners or suppliers, the research showed. Some organisations added that e-business was now low on their corporate priority list. Among the concerns voiced were difficulties in acquiring and keeping skilled staff, problems integrating websites with established departments and the marketing costs of a high-profile web presence. Some firms had experienced difficulties after leaving online strategy to their marketing departments, with IT personnel given responsibility only for implementation. But Martha Bennett, vice-president of research in Europe for Giga Information Group, said that the pendulum swing away from e-commerce belied the business opportunities still available on the web. \"There is a golden opportunity right now, especially for existing companies that have perhaps been a bit slow in adapting to the internet,\" she said. \"It is the perfect time for them to recruit the much needed technical staff and get their websites working for them. \"We need to get out of the mind set of thinking about on and off-line companies. Firms with strong existing brands can easily benefit from from the the internet as an additional channel of trade. \"There is evidence emerging that those companies with a wide variety of transaction channels tend to be the most profitable.\"",

Villagers took cover behind walls as heavy fire from all directions hit the main street. At least 12 Palestinians and four Israeli soldiers were wounded. Two Israeli helicopters fired machine guns as they evacuated the army casualties, who had been trapped for almost an hour.

The prime minister, Ehud Barak, called a special meeting of his security cabinet to discuss what his aide, Danny Yatom, described as \"a very negative jump in the scope and severity of events\". Earlier in the same area, say Israeli police, Palestinian gunmen fired on the Jewish settlement of Gilo and Israeli troops responded by firing at the adjacent Palestinian district of Beit Jala. Gilo, occupied by Israel in 1967 and annexed to Jerusalem, has been a regular trouble spot since the violence erupted five weeks ago. In Gaza, where tens of thousands of mourners attended funerals of four Palestinians killed on Tuesday, two Palestinians, aged 15 and 17, were shot dead yesterday during stone-throwing clashes with soldiers at the Karni crossing on the Israel-Gaza border. During the funeral processions there were shouts of \"revenge\" and calls for a \"day of heightened escalation\" on Friday. Meanwhile, Israel's elder statesman, Shimon Peres, said he would shortly hold talks with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat - the first high-level meeting between the two sides for six weeks. Mr Peres, who was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with Mr Arafat for earlier peace efforts, is believed to have a better relationship with Mr Arafat than Mr Barak has. But although Mr Peres said he would be seeking Mr Afarat's commitment to last month's Sharm al-Sheikh truce agreement, his expectations were not high. \"I just think that, even when there is shooting, we need to talk,\" he told Israeli army radio. Mr Arafat yesterday met the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, in Gaza city, and called for greater European involvement in peace talks. \"We are looking for a German stance, a European stance to push the peace process forward, to protect the peace process,\" he said.

He said he would ask the US to intervene to lift what he described as Israel's siege and to press Israel to ease tension by withdrawing troops from the entrances of Palestinian cities. Israel's Likud leader, Ariel Sharon, said yesterday that he did not believe that the peace process was dead, but \"I don't believe we can reach a permanent agreement\". He said that the issues of Jerusalem, security in the Jordan river area, and the right of return claimed by Palestinians made a permanent settlement impossible.

In a sign of growing Jewish distrust of Israel's Arab citizens, the Israeli army said yesterday that it plans to erect electrified fences around some villages to protect them from \"hostile\" neighbours. Weapons storage rooms and firing posts would also be provided. The army has drawn up a list of villages to be fortified, which all lie within Israel's 1967 boundaries. Those selected are in Galilee or close to the occupied West Bank, and are near to Arab villages or in isolated areas where they could potentially be cut off. The plan still needs to be approved by a ministerial committee. Arab citizens, who make up about 18% of Israel's 6m population, have largely stayed out of the recent violence - though 13 of them have been killed since the intifada began. Simultaneously, the Damascus-based Fatah Uprising group, which broke away from Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah movement in 1983, announced that a group called the \"Omar al-Mukhtar Forces\" would be carrying out attacks within Israel as part of the militant arm of Fatah Uprising. It said the aim would be \"to strengthen our struggle inside our occupied land and meet all the needs of resistance and secure its continuity and momentum\". Although Omar al-Mukhtar Forces has existed for about two years and has claimed several attacks inside Israel, its connection with Fatah Uprising had not previously been known.

After weeks confined to the sidelines by the Gore high command, Mr Clinton belatedly gets his chance to turn things around for his party with the first of two high profile rallies in California, possibly followed by visits to close-fought Michigan and his home state of Arkansas at the weekend. Mr Clinton's prime task is to energise traditional Democrats to vote in what is expected to be another low participation contest. Recent polls have frightened Democratic leaders by suggesting that Mr Bush could be mounting a comeback challenge for California's 54 electoral college votes, the biggest prize in the presidential race. Turnout will be a vital issue everywhere because polls show that the Democratic faithful are marginally less enthused to vote on Tuesday than their Republican counterparts. However, the polls said the same thing in the 1998 midterm elections, when core Democrats actually voted in unexpectedly large numbers at the height of the Clinton impeachment crisis. Mr Clinton's main target in all his appearances is the black American vote, which has remained resolutely loyal to him throughout his travails. The Democrats have spent much of the campaign keeping Mr Clinton at arm's length, in a clear attempt to separate themselves from any whiff of sexual sleaze. But sex may well be very much on the agenda in Los Angeles tonight. Not far from where Mr Clinton will be rallying the troops, Larry Flynt, the publisher of the porn magazine Hustler and a supporter of the Democrats, will also be campaigning. He will be making a rare show at his own \"get out the vote\" rally in Hollywood at almost the same time as the president's appearance. Instead of aides and secret servicemen, Mr Flynt will be flanked by \"the girls of Hustler magazine\" and will be signing autographs and copies of his autobiography, An Unseemly Man. Mr Flynt, the subject of the film, The People vs Larry Flynt, is likely to provide exactly the sort of lewd publicity that the Gore campaign is frantic to avoid. Gore advisers had all their worst fears confirmed this week when Mr Clinton gave an interview to Esquire magazine in which he said that the Republicans should apologise to the country for trying to drive him from office over the Monica Lewinsky affair. Mr Clinton's impeachment remains the most intriguing, semi-submerged issue of this year's campaign, making the man who is probably the Democratic party's greatest asset simultaneously its most crucial potential liability. In a campaign full of ironies, it remains perfectly possible that Mr Gore could lose the White House at the same time as the Democrats recapture control of the Congress by ousting at least three Republicans who played leading roles in the impeachment drive. Meanwhile, as Mr Bush kept up his momentum towards victory with two campaign rallies in Minnesota, the Democrats insisted that they could still come from behind in the national polls and retain the White House next week. As if to prove the point, Mr Gore spent a full day on the stump in Florida, another vital and vote-rich state where local polls continue to show him leading Mr Bush. The battle for Florida has drawn almost all the key players this week, including the Republican nominee's father, former President George Bush, who campaigned in the state on Tuesday. Like Mr Clinton, the former Republican president has been kept very much in the wings by his party's high command.

In the US, the Nasdaq, where many technology companies are listed, has slumped 40% this year, while e-retailers on this side of the Atlantic, including Boo.com and the most recent casualty, CD retailer Boxman, have gone to the wall. You could be forgiven for thinking that the notion of e-tycoons is as unrealistic as the hope of dot.com profits. </p> <p>Not so. The internet has made millions for some, like newbie millionaires Charlie Muirhead and Neil Bradford. Muirhead is the 24-year-old founder of Orchestream, a software developer which has raised $32m in venture capital, while Bradford, 28, has seen his wealth take a quantum leap after his firm, Fletcher Research, was acquired by Forrester, the Boston-based internet technology research house, in May last year. </p> <p>Both have made a pile of money, albeit mostly on paper, and can afford to take time off and indulge in an extended cruise in the Caribbean. But they are still hard at work and seem to have undergone little change in their lifestyle. In that sense, Muirhead and Bradford are no different from tycoons past and present. Rupert Murdoch trundles on, despite his advanced years. America's most controversial tycoon, John D Rockefeller, beavered away despite amassing colossal fortunes. </p> <p>But why do they show so little inclination to pack it all in and become lotus-eaters? It seems that, besides enjoying what they do, the desire to keep on working or to stick to ventures in the field they know is probably a way of keeping grounded. </p> <p>Bradford, who works out of an office on Charlotte Street in central London, still sports the classic new economy attire - Gap trousers and open-necked shirt. And he is clearly a man more at ease in talking about the future of the internet than about any lifestyle changes precipitated by his new-found wealth. Yes, he has bought a house, he says, but his interest in analysis of the internet revolution remains undimmed. </p> <p>He appears lost for words when asked if he thinks he deserves his new-found wealth. After a pause, he says: \"I don't want to say it was due to luck, because that would sound like false modesty. We had to work very hard.\" </p> <p>But he does admit to occasionally waking up and feeling that the Fletcher Research success story is all a bit unreal. \"Two years ago we were working in a converted warehouse in Ladbroke Grove on a shoestring, with a couple of computers, some phone lines, and relying on credit card funding,\" he says. \"My friends had great jobs at great companies and we asked ourselves how long we could keep going, how long we could flog a dead horse.\" </p> <p>Now it is probably their friends who are casting envious glances at Bradford and Will Reeve, Fletcher Research co-founder. They struck gold when Forrester, one of the world's most respected internet research firms, decided to buy Fletcher. The two now have Forrester shares by the bucket-load and enjoy a degree of security most people can only dream of. The biggest impact on Bradford, however, seems to be that he can concentrate on research, his forte. </p> <p>\"The job's changed,\" he said. \"We used to muck in and do everything: writing, editing, researching. As you grow, your roles become more defined. People can concentrate on what they are best at.\" </p> <p>While his professional world has been transformed, Bradford maintains that his personal life has changed little. \"It's not as if I've dumped my old friends and party in Soho with glamorous models,\" he says. \"I still hang out with my university friends, and people I've known for ever see no differences.\" </p> <p>At Orchestream, Muirhead falls into the same category of new economy millionaires who prefer to keep their noses to the grindstone. </p> <p>Orchestream developed a piece of software designed to ensure the reliable transmission of data along computer companies' networks and the internet, using the basic internet protocol (IP) technology that allows computers to communicate with each other over the net. </p> <p>After that success, instead of resting on his laurels, Muirhead has started Igabriel, a network of angel investors that can help start-ups. The network builds on the extensive network Muirhead built up in his previous company's brief but rapid rise. Capped at about 100 movers and shakers - Brent Hoberman of Lastminute.com is part of the inner circle - Igabriel focuses on wireless and mobile commerce opportunities. The network says it has backing from a prominent private equity firm and intends to take on around 25 to 30 business plans a year. </p> <p>Asked why he doesn't just stop to enjoy his money, Muirhead insists that he is not in it for the money. </p> <p>'I want to do something for the people who are starting out now because I know what it was like for me when I started Orchestream without any contacts,\" says Muirhead. His ambition is to remain a \"perpetual entrepreneur\". Like Forrester, Muirhead makes the point that his ilk are driven by challenges rather than financial rewards. Money is clearly secondary to the buzz of being trailblazers in this hot but volatile sector. </p> <p>Because fortunes in the UK internet sector are a recent phenomenon, these new millionaires have yet to lift their eyes beyond their immediate world. In the US, where new money is quickly acquiring the status of old money, internet millionaires have branched out. </p> <p>At Cisco, the internet infrastructure company, quite a few of the new rich have started private family foundations with funds that range between $1m and \u00a3100m. Some foundations are designed to address specific issues such as cancer research or education. Others accept grant requests from any qualified non-profit organisation. </p> <p>The biggest foundation, of course, is that of Microsoft's Bill Gates, who has turned philanthropist with a vengeance. Major donations to date include $250m to international vaccine projects through the Gates Foundation and a further $209m to endow the Gates Cambridge Scholarship Trust. </p> <p>Given the way trends migrate here from America, it is likely that the new British e-tycoons will embark on philanthropic activities in their turn, especially as the chancellor, Gordon Brown, is giving them tax breaks. </p> <p>Leading the way is one of Britain's earliest internet tycoons, QXL founder Tim Jackson. He has recently stepped down as a non-executive director at the online auction house to concentrate on his new venture capital role at Carlyle Internet Partners Europe and at a charitable foundation he is setting up.</p>",

Asked why he doesn't just stop to enjoy his money, Muirhead insists that he is not in it for the money. 'I want to do something for the people who are starting out now because I know what it was like for me when I started Orchestream without any contacts,\" says Muirhead. His ambition is to remain a \"perpetual entrepreneur\". Like Forrester, Muirhead makes the point that his ilk are driven by challenges rather than financial rewards. Money is clearly secondary to the buzz of being trailblazers in this hot but volatile sector. Because fortunes in the UK internet sector are a recent phenomenon, these new millionaires have yet to lift their eyes beyond their immediate world. In the US, where new money is quickly acquiring the status of old money, internet millionaires have branched out. At Cisco, the internet infrastructure company, quite a few of the new rich have started private family foundations with funds that range between $1m and \u00a3100m. Some foundations are designed to address specific issues such as cancer research or education. Others accept grant requests from any qualified non-profit organisation. The biggest foundation, of course, is that of Microsoft's Bill Gates, who has turned philanthropist with a vengeance. Major donations to date include $250m to international vaccine projects through the Gates Foundation and a further $209m to endow the Gates Cambridge Scholarship Trust. Given the way trends migrate here from America, it is likely that the new British e-tycoons will embark on philanthropic activities in their turn, especially as the chancellor, Gordon Brown, is giving them tax breaks. Leading the way is one of Britain's earliest internet tycoons, QXL founder Tim Jackson. He has recently stepped down as a non-executive director at the online auction house to concentrate on his new venture capital role at Carlyle Internet Partners Europe and at a charitable foundation he is setting up.",

      "body": "<p>Last year, a litter of pet supplies sites set out to be the fat cats of the online world, creaming in huge profits from the \u00a33bn market for pet products and services created by Britain's millions of pet owners. As recently as the start of this year, investors still nursed hopes that they would soon be purring with delight at the scale of their newly made fortunes. All the site owners had to do was to persuade pet lovers to shop online. </p> <p>But it has proved to be a lot harder than it sounds. Despite spending millions on advertising, pet web supply sites on both sides of the Atlantic have failed to generate the revenues they expected. San Francisco-based Petopia.com recently laid off 120 people - 60% of its workforce - as it continued to struggle in its hunt for new finance. Its difficulties began in February, when Pets.com went public but then saw its shares plummet in value. In the wake of the disappointing flotation, Petopia and Petsmart.com both pulled their plans for public shore offerings and began a hunt for money from elsewhere. </p> <p>In the UK, the mood has changed too. Venture capitalists are running scared, and the main talk is of mergers and acquisitions. Rumours are rife of pet sites putting themselves up for sale so investors can make some kind of return on their money. If you were once considered smart to be investing in a pet web site, in the current climate you are likely to be considered barking mad. </p> <p>Petspark.com's chief executive, Adrian Marrullier, explains: \"When the business plans were originally composed, they did not take into account the level of uptake from the British public, and they did not take into account the cost of delivery.\" </p> <p>Petspark's site is heavily dependent on pet food sales, and Marrullier is attempting to appeal to customers to help him make the business more profitable. At the moment he has to subsidise the postage of cat and dog food to the tune of about \u00a35 a delivery. \"Most dot.coms are profitable before they have to pay for postage,\" he says. \"We are about to embark on a campaign where we will explain this to our customers and we will give them the option to pay full postage.\" </p> <p> Not only has it been difficult asking online pet customers to fork out for the cost of deliveries, but it has also been hard to get them to break with traditional shopping habits. \"Pets have a unique position in a family. The pet is a member of the family and not a possession. A pet can be a surrogate husband for a widow or be treated like a child,\" Marrullier says. </p> <p>Because of that, a pet's food is usually bought as part of the main family shopping at a supermarket. While he argues that specialist pet sites can offer greater choice than supermarkets, it has proved hard to migrate traditional pet shoppers online. </p> <p>Some pet site owners argue that smart marketing is the key to the revival of the sector. Kevin Hague, founder of PetPlanet.co.uk, hopes his site will become profitable early next year. He says it is important to identify a segment of the pet market that can be reached effectively without burning up huge amounts of cash in an advertising blitz. </p> <p>\"There is a core market of pet obsessives and these are the guys we want to get online. It's about targeting breed charities,\" says Hague. Niche pet groups are seen as a good way of building up the credibility of an online pet service. In the early stages, they can even be used to fine tune site content offerings. </p> <p>But the fall-out in the UK pet sector is starting. Petplanet recently snapped up Petz.co.uk, and other acquisitions are tipped to follow. Speculation is intense over who is going to be the next to be bought out. </p> <p>Charles Fallon, chief executive of PetsPyjamas, claims that his rivals are jealous of the size of his pan-European business, but refuses to confirm strong industry speculation that it is up for sale. \"We have people approaching us all the time and we always look at the options,\" he says. </p> <p>PetsPyjamas, which has a traditional catalogue business as well, claims that online orders are up by about 30% on last year. Nevertheless, he concedes that it is tough making money in the online pet sector. \"It is very hard for an internet business to make money solely as an internet business. More and more dot.coms are introducing traditional catalogue businesses as part of their propositions.\" </p> <p>Knowing that investors in the pet sector are not going to reap the handsome profits they originally anticipated, pet site owners realise that from now on it is important to manage their expectations. </p> <p>\"I don't think we will be profitable until about 2002. But we have to manage expectations. Some people in this market will just be happy to get their money back,\" reckons Petspark's Marrullier, who organises monthly meeting with his investors to keep them up to date with progress against agreed targets. </p> <p>In many ways, the pet sector has become a miniature version of the problems afflicting the broader dot.com world. Having spent heavily on advertising, plenty of them failed to put together a business model that could deliver sufficient returns to sustain their phenomenal cash burn rate. Now they are either facing liquidation or the prospect of being swallowed up by an online rival or a bricks and mortar company. </p> <p>\"To an extent, the venture capitalists are to blame,\" says Jacqui Hendriks, a senior analyst for the Gartner Research Group. Many venture capitalists were hypnotised by new ideas, she says, and failed to thoroughly scrutinise the business models that were supposed to deliver the dreams. </p> <p>Ironically, there are even reports of some venture capitalists sending away some pet site owners in the early days because they were not being ambitious enough. \"Now dot.coms are having to become more realistic,\" adds Hendriks. \"They have to be like bricks and mortar companies.\" </p> <p>From an investor's point of view, a lot of pet sites are now in the dog house. Investors feel they have been let down and hope to recoup their losses from different sectors. </p> <p>But analysts tend to see this falling out of love with the pet sector as an over-emotional reaction and believe that the online market still holds potential, if sites can get their strategies right. </p> <p>With uncompromising financial realities starting to bite, pet sites are learning to fight tooth and nail to survive.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last year, a litter of pet supplies sites set out to be the fat cats of the online world, creaming in huge profits from the \u00a33bn market for pet products and services created by Britain's millions of pet owners. As recently as the start of this year, investors still nursed hopes that they would soon be purring with delight at the scale of their newly made fortunes. All the site owners had to do was to persuade pet lovers to shop online. But it has proved to be a lot harder than it sounds. Despite spending millions on advertising, pet web supply sites on both sides of the Atlantic have failed to generate the revenues they expected. San Francisco-based Petopia.com recently laid off 120 people - 60% of its workforce - as it continued to struggle in its hunt for new finance. Its difficulties began in February, when Pets.com went public but then saw its shares plummet in value. In the wake of the disappointing flotation, Petopia and Petsmart.com both pulled their plans for public shore offerings and began a hunt for money from elsewhere. In the UK, the mood has changed too. Venture capitalists are running scared, and the main talk is of mergers and acquisitions. Rumours are rife of pet sites putting themselves up for sale so investors can make some kind of return on their money. If you were once considered smart to be investing in a pet web site, in the current climate you are likely to be considered barking mad. Petspark.com's chief executive, Adrian Marrullier, explains: \"When the business plans were originally composed, they did not take into account the level of uptake from the British public, and they did not take into account the cost of delivery.\" Petspark's site is heavily dependent on pet food sales, and Marrullier is attempting to appeal to customers to help him make the business more profitable. At the moment he has to subsidise the postage of cat and dog food to the tune of about \u00a35 a delivery. \"Most dot.coms are profitable before they have to pay for postage,\" he says. \"We are about to embark on a campaign where we will explain this to our customers and we will give them the option to pay full postage.\" Not only has it been difficult asking online pet customers to fork out for the cost of deliveries, but it has also been hard to get them to break with traditional shopping habits. \"Pets have a unique position in a family. The pet is a member of the family and not a possession. A pet can be a surrogate husband for a widow or be treated like a child,\" Marrullier says. Because of that, a pet's food is usually bought as part of the main family shopping at a supermarket. While he argues that specialist pet sites can offer greater choice than supermarkets, it has proved hard to migrate traditional pet shoppers online. Some pet site owners argue that smart marketing is the key to the revival of the sector. Kevin Hague, founder of PetPlanet.co.uk, hopes his site will become profitable early next year. He says it is important to identify a segment of the pet market that can be reached effectively without burning up huge amounts of cash in an advertising blitz. \"There is a core market of pet obsessives and these are the guys we want to get online. It's about targeting breed charities,\" says Hague. Niche pet groups are seen as a good way of building up the credibility of an online pet service. In the early stages, they can even be used to fine tune site content offerings. But the fall-out in the UK pet sector is starting. Petplanet recently snapped up Petz.co.uk, and other acquisitions are tipped to follow. Speculation is intense over who is going to be the next to be bought out. Charles Fallon, chief executive of PetsPyjamas, claims that his rivals are jealous of the size of his pan-European business, but refuses to confirm strong industry speculation that it is up for sale. \"We have people approaching us all the time and we always look at the options,\" he says. PetsPyjamas, which has a traditional catalogue business as well, claims that online orders are up by about 30% on last year. Nevertheless, he concedes that it is tough making money in the online pet sector. \"It is very hard for an internet business to make money solely as an internet business. More and more dot.coms are introducing traditional catalogue businesses as part of their propositions.\" Knowing that investors in the pet sector are not going to reap the handsome profits they originally anticipated, pet site owners realise that from now on it is important to manage their expectations. \"I don't think we will be profitable until about 2002. But we have to manage expectations. Some people in this market will just be happy to get their money back,\" reckons Petspark's Marrullier, who organises monthly meeting with his investors to keep them up to date with progress against agreed targets. In many ways, the pet sector has become a miniature version of the problems afflicting the broader dot.com world. Having spent heavily on advertising, plenty of them failed to put together a business model that could deliver sufficient returns to sustain their phenomenal cash burn rate. Now they are either facing liquidation or the prospect of being swallowed up by an online rival or a bricks and mortar company. \"To an extent, the venture capitalists are to blame,\" says Jacqui Hendriks, a senior analyst for the Gartner Research Group. Many venture capitalists were hypnotised by new ideas, she says, and failed to thoroughly scrutinise the business models that were supposed to deliver the dreams. Ironically, there are even reports of some venture capitalists sending away some pet site owners in the early days because they were not being ambitious enough. \"Now dot.coms are having to become more realistic,\" adds Hendriks. \"They have to be like bricks and mortar companies.\" From an investor's point of view, a lot of pet sites are now in the dog house. Investors feel they have been let down and hope to recoup their losses from different sectors. But analysts tend to see this falling out of love with the pet sector as an over-emotional reaction and believe that the online market still holds potential, if sites can get their strategies right. With uncompromising financial realities starting to bite, pet sites are learning to fight tooth and nail to survive.",

The American evidence suggests that Baytril hampers attempts to treat serious cases of campylobacter, of which there were 55,000 recorded instances in Britain last year. The bug, often found in birds, causes profuse diarrhoea in humans. Some cases need further treatment and in the US this involves a human antibiotic. Experts here question however whether people are regularly treated in the same way. About 700kg of Baytril was used under prescription in poultry in Britain last year to treat bacterial infection. It is not meant to be used less than eight days before a bird is killed for the table. Richard Young, policy adviser to the Soil Association, said: \"We have known for years that intensive livestock production is unacceptable for animal welfare. This provides more evidence it is also unacceptable for human health.\"",

      "bodyText": "The equal opportunities commission yesterday backed plans to modernise the House of Commons, saying scrapping all-night sittings would lure more women to Parliament. Ending all debates at 10pm will prove more \"family friendly\", the commission believes, while reforms to introduce timetabling of debates will make Parliament more efficient and effective. The commission's unequivocal support for the plans - which would form part of the most radical shake-up of Parliament in 20 years - was outlined in a letter from its chairwoman, Julie Mellor, to Margaret Beckett, leader of the Commons and chairwoman of its modernisation committee, which will be released to MPs today in preparation for their debate on modernisation on Tuesday. In the letter, Ms Mellor congratulates the modernisation committee on approving the plans, and notes: \"I am sure these changes will pave the way for further changes to make the House of Commons more efficient, effective and family friendly\". She adds that the proposals would \"make the job of an MP more attractive to a greater variety of women and men\". She suggests even more could be done to make Parliament more efficient, including ensuring MPs manage their work more efficiently, and the development of a culture that supports \"the professionalism of politicians\". Support from the commission is likely to be seized on by Labour backbenchers who have been pressing for more civilised hours. One MP said: \"It's important because it shows many people outside are watching how modernisation progresses and want to see an efficient and modern house.\" Conservative politicians are still expected to oppose the end of late night sittings, claiming it will weaken the ability of the Opposition to hold the government to account and amounts to a cynical attempt to stifle them. Forcing MPs to sit through the night is an old tactic to disrupt the governement's timetabling of Commons business, and was used by Labour MPs throughout the eighties. The committee, which has already initiated reforms ensuring backbenchers can hold more debates in the mornings and allowing MPs to leave the Commons earlier on Thursdays, suggests debates end at 10pm from Monday to Wednesday, allowing MPs to escape from Westminster after voting at 10.30pm. But it also offers an olive branch to the Conservatives and Lib Dems by proposing a cross-party committee to agree on how the government timetables Commons debates.",

So, \"35 to 37%!\" yelled Mr Hague (the figure allegedly had something to do with tax). Miss Widdecombe rolled her eyes. Mr Portillo closed his. \"When we came to office it was 35.3%,\" said Mr Blair. Miss Widdecombe threw her head back in fake laughter. Mr Portillo's chin nodded down into his chest. Anyone unfamiliar with that razor-sharp mind might have imagined he was dozing. \"Fully \u00a3670 a year for the typical hard-working family!\" Mr Hague continued. Miss Widdecombe leaned forward, plaited both her fingers and arms together, then placed the resulting cat's cradle on her knees, as if the horror of these statistics had caused her body to go into spasm. Mr Portillo suddenly shook his head and opened his eyes. Mr Blair hit back with more meaningless numbers. \"Ten per cent under the last administration, 6% under Labour!\" he said. Mr Hague returned with, \"In 1997, the poorest fifth paid only 37p in the pound.\" Miss Widdecombe hugged herself (her arms can't quite reach round). Mr Portillo slumped gently forward on the bench. Finally Mr Blair announced that \"\u00a3200 of your figures assumes that every family in the country smokes 20 or 30 cigarettes a day!\" It was the equivalent of the triumphant cry of \"Mornington Crescent\". As Labour MPs dissolved in happy laughter, the lovely Samantha would have awarded him maximum points.",

It started with accusations against Pakistanis; then it was extended to other assorted foreigners; now, for the first time, an England player has been directly implicated. The noise you heard yesterday was the sound of indignation roaring out of the shires.</p> <p>The allegation against Alec Stewart was in fact a very minor detail in the Indian police report. But in Britain parochial interest has obscured the truly sensational suggestions: that Mohammad Azharuddin has actually admitted being corrupt, and that Brian Lara now stands accused.</p> <p>Match-fixing is a crime especially associated with the incessant, contrived and context-free one-day international tournaments that fill every spare space in the cricketing schedule to provide cheap TV programmes. Azharuddin has played more of these than anybody else. If he falls, it is the damnation of an era, not just a person.</p> <p>Still, there is something peculiarly shocking about the naming of Stewart. In an unheroic era for English cricket, he has been a staunch and soldierly symbol of defiance. Though his name has been whispered for some time, it is still a bit like reading a headline saying Pope In Sex Shocker. Not him too, surely?</p> <p>Well, I hope not. I have met hundreds of professional cricketers and can only think of three who have written a thank you letter for some small service rendered. Alec was one of them. The Stewarts are a fine, close-knit family who have stood for many of whatever virtues remain in English cricket.</p> <p>Even if the allegation is true, then in itself it amounts to nothing criminal. This was 1993, when a fixer in India was simply a bloke who might know how to buy a bottle of whisky or a train ticket. If a bookmaker asked for information, so what? It would have seemed no different than putting one's name on top of a bit of ghost-written garbage in a newspaper - money for old rope, but hardly reprehensible. Alec would have had an extra reason not to be suspicious: though his father was also an England cricketer, his grandpa was a bookie.</p> <p>It was 1998 before anyone began to realise that Indian bookmakers were engaged in entrapment. Giving harmless information to them was the first dip of the toes into a murky river swirling towards destruction. Soon, they start to make other, more dangerous, requests. And there are no thank you letters.</p> <p>Stewart has denied everything, point-blank, and so far there is no corroboration. This makes things simpler. You cannot rely on solitary denunciations. Whatever Lord MacLaurin might have said about people being guilty until proved innocent, it is obviously right that Stewart should continue playing - unless and until there is serious evidence against him.</p> <p>If he is lying, it is a different matter. Something that is hardly even a misdemeanour then becomes wholly felonious. After years of cover-ups at every level, it is crucial that cricketers and cricket at last tell the whole truth.</p>",

The noise you heard yesterday was the sound of indignation roaring out of the shires. The allegation against Alec Stewart was in fact a very minor detail in the Indian police report. But in Britain parochial interest has obscured the truly sensational suggestions: that Mohammad Azharuddin has actually admitted being corrupt, and that Brian Lara now stands accused. Match-fixing is a crime especially associated with the incessant, contrived and context-free one-day international tournaments that fill every spare space in the cricketing schedule to provide cheap TV programmes. Azharuddin has played more of these than anybody else. If he falls, it is the damnation of an era, not just a person. Still, there is something peculiarly shocking about the naming of Stewart. In an unheroic era for English cricket, he has been a staunch and soldierly symbol of defiance. Though his name has been whispered for some time, it is still a bit like reading a headline saying Pope In Sex Shocker. Not him too, surely? Well, I hope not. I have met hundreds of professional cricketers and can only think of three who have written a thank you letter for some small service rendered. Alec was one of them. The Stewarts are a fine, close-knit family who have stood for many of whatever virtues remain in English cricket. Even if the allegation is true, then in itself it amounts to nothing criminal. This was 1993, when a fixer in India was simply a bloke who might know how to buy a bottle of whisky or a train ticket. If a bookmaker asked for information, so what? It would have seemed no different than putting one's name on top of a bit of ghost-written garbage in a newspaper - money for old rope, but hardly reprehensible. Alec would have had an extra reason not to be suspicious: though his father was also an England cricketer, his grandpa was a bookie. It was 1998 before anyone began to realise that Indian bookmakers were engaged in entrapment. Giving harmless information to them was the first dip of the toes into a murky river swirling towards destruction. Soon, they start to make other, more dangerous, requests. And there are no thank you letters. Stewart has denied everything, point-blank, and so far there is no corroboration. This makes things simpler. You cannot rely on solitary denunciations. Whatever Lord MacLaurin might have said about people being guilty until proved innocent, it is obviously right that Stewart should continue playing - unless and until there is serious evidence against him. If he is lying, it is a different matter. Something that is hardly even a misdemeanour then becomes wholly felonious. After years of cover-ups at every level, it is crucial that cricketers and cricket at last tell the whole truth.",

Steve held no grudge against the man. \"Twelve roses for 80 quid! Who's going to buy that? Why don't they sell local tropical flowers?\" At last he wrenched off his whiskers and stood magnificently revealed as managing director of The Rest Of The World. Moral of the series is that nowadays nobody knows what the boss looks like. \"The only acceptable British picnic is whelks with vinegar and pepper, in the car, parked on a seafront somewhere with headscarves on and the windows rolled down.\" Jeremy Round, as quoted by Rick Stein in Rick Stein's Seafood Lovers' Guide (BBC 2).",

In neighbouring Pakistan, where the England team is touring, English cricket officials were left reeling by the report, following claims that the former captain, Alec Stewart, had been paid \u00a35,000 to supply information to a bookmaker in 1993. Rumours that English players had been involved in match-fixing had been circulating within cricket for several years but none had ever been named and nobody had ever pointed the finger of accusation so publicly at any English player. Even the world's most famous cricketer, the West Indian batsman Brian Lara was implicated, with one bookmaker alleging that he paid him $40,000 (\u00a326,500) for playing badly in two one-day internationals in India in 1994. Even before the report was made fully public yesterday, its contents had started to leak out and the denials were already being issued throughout the cricketing world.

The Cronje scandal prompted Indian authorities into taking action and it is largely through their efforts that the lid on match-fixing has been lifted. In a cricket-obsessed country like India millions of pounds are regularly bet on cricket matches. The bets are taken by businessmen working as illegal bookmakers who will also take wagers on how many wickets a team may lose, the number of runs a particular player may score or wickets he might take.

The use of computer and mobile phones has given a major fillip to the racket.\" While some of the players named in the CBI report have been accused of being paid to play badly, others like Stewart stand accused of supplying information. For bookmakers, gaining information on which team has won the toss or pitch conditions will affect the odds they set and this can make a difference between winning or losing large amounts of money. The CBI based its report on the testimony of 16 Indian bookmakers who all confessed to being involved in match-fixing. One of the main names to emerge in connection with the players is Mukesh Gupta, a Delhi-based businessman and part-time bookmaker, who claimed that he paid hundreds of thousands of pounds to players in return for playing badly or supplying information.

      "bodyText": "Suspicion that the doomed jumbo jet in Wednesday's Singapore Airlines disaster in Taiwan may have used the wrong runway heightened the agony as rescue workers removed the final bodies from the typhoon-swept wreckage at Chiang Kai-shek international airport. The airport authorities and Singapore Airlines gave different versions of what might have caused the death of 79 of the 179 passengers and crew. Nearly all those who died were killed instantly, trapped in their seats as the plane burst into flames. The plane's fuel tanks had been full for the 15-hour flight to Los Angeles. More than 50 survivors were in hospital in Taipei, some suffering from severe burns and smoke inhalation. More than 40 scrambled to safety, including the three cockpit crew. Only one person remained unaccounted for last night. Yesterday morning emergency teams surrounded the crash site with a ring of parked trucks and cars to try to prevent the gale-force winds from disturbing vital evidence. The two \"black box\" flight recorders have been located. The plane had slammed back on to the runway while taking off in appalling weather conditions, which were at first thought to have caused the crash. But speculation mounted yesterday that the plane had hit an object on the scheduled runway, or might have taxied on to the wrong runway altogether, one that was out of service, its edges littered with construction equipment. Taiwanese officials, on the defensive for keeping the airport open as Typhoon Xangsane drew near, insisted that wind speeds and visibility levels were within proper limits. They hinted at pilot error, suggesting that the plane may have swerved off its runway and on to the one which was under repair. But a Singapore Airlines official said that the pilot, Captain CK Foong, a veteran with more than 11,000 hours of flying time to his record, \"saw an object on the runway and he tried to take off and he hit the object\". If true, this would suggest negligence on the part of the airport. The airline said there was no evidence that the plane used the wrong runway. But, as daylight dawned, it became clear that the wreckage lay on a parallel runway to the one that Flight SQ006 should have used for take-off. \"We cannot tell at this stage whether he took the wrong runway, or veered off to the supplementary runway and then hit the equipment,\" said the airport's head of traffic control, Zhang Guozheng, yesterday.

      "body": "<p>It reads a bit like a detective story, but there is not enough evidence to convict. We're talking about endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), man-made chemicals that are additives in plastics, packaging, household cleaners, food cans, cosmetics and deodorants. Our crops are sprayed with pesticides, some of which are also classified as EDCs. Then there are the natural EDCs, grouped as phytoestrogens, which are found in plants and vegetables. Our lives are awash with EDCs, but the big question is whether or not they are affecting our fertility and our health. </p> <p>The story began in the 1930s with the wide introduction of industrial chemicals that would \"revolutionise\" our lives. Between 1933 and 1938, the journal Nature published some short reports on the biological effects of several industrial chemicals. They had activity like the female sex hormone oestrogen, albeit much weaker than the natural hormone. Then, in 1938, Edward Dodds announced his discovery of a chemical, diethylstilboestrol (DES), that could mimic the action of oestrogen, and Paul M\u00fcller announced his discovery of a powerful new pesticide, DDT. </p> <p>DES, was hailed as a \"wonder drug\" and DDT as a \"miraculous pesticide\". The two chemicals were not only structurally related, the pesticide also had weak oestrogenic activity. They were both found to feminise young male animals. </p> <p>Fresh evidence of the decline of certain wildlife populations began to surface in the late 1950s. During the next 20 years, more and more field studies pointed to the possibility that man-made chemicals released into our environment could disrupt normal sexual development and hence the breeding competence of subsequent generations. For example, abnormally small penises were seen among alligators born in Lake Apopka in Florida, which had been polluted by an industrial spillage. Intersex or hermaphrodite fish were found in UK rivers receiving sewage effluent, and male sexual organs were found in female molluscs, particularly those living around harbours and marinas. </p> <p>By the 1980s, concern resurfaced after studies on wildlife populations showed that pollution was affecting fertility and survival. A DDT-like pesticide was blamed for the decline in the alligator population and tributyl tin in anti-barnacle marine paint was linked with intersex molluscs. The only chemicals identified as possible causative agents for intersex fish living by sewage works were natural oestrogens and a synthetic oestrogen in the contraceptive pill secreted in urine. </p> <p>More than 50 years later, the long forgotten evidence from the 1930s that industrial chemicals had oestrogenic activity resurfaced. Ana Soto and her colleagues, working in Boston on an oestrogen sensitive tumour cell line, suddenly found their experiments had all gone haywire. </p> <p>After months of laborious detective work they discovered that the cause of the problem was plastic tubes. Without changing specification, the company supplying the laboratory plastics had added an oestrogenic alkylphenol, nonylphenol, to their products. This industrial chemical, also used in domestic products and cosmetics, was leaching into their culture solutions so that cells were growing like crazy. In California, by coincidence, David Feldman and his colleagues were also finding that their experiments were being contaminated by another plastic additive, bisphenol A. The list of EDCs was beginning to grow. </p> <p>The media really latched on to EDCs when Niels Skakkebaek and his colleagues at the University of Copenhagen researched the scientific literature and found that all the published data suggested that average sperm counts had dropped by almost 50% between 1938 and 1990. Was this a result of pollution and increased testicular cancer, which has doubled in the last 20 years? </p> <p> R ichard Sharpe, an expert in reproductive toxicology from the MRC reproductive unit in Edinburgh, believes the issue of declining sperm counts is a melting pot. \"There is no overall standard for the accuracy of counting sperm in the first place, and different laboratories with different samples and different observers will, of course, come up with different results. And one has to remember that sperm counts also show a natural seasonal variation. Strictly speaking, there is, as yet, no definitive evidence for declining sperm counts. But that doesn't necessarily mean they are not declining.\" </p> <p>Controlled laboratory studies have shown that EDCs can muscle in with the activity of sex hormones and, in high doses, can unbalance sexual development and function. At first they were all thought to be weak impostors of natural oestrogens, but it looks as though different chemicals may have different types of action. </p> <p>However they act, EDCs have been causally linked to the rise in the incidence of breast cancer and a trend towards earlier puberty. But is the rise in breast cancer due to better detection over the years, and is earlier puberty due to better nutrition? These are ponderables without any direct evidence. Certainly no evidence to convict. </p> <p>There are more than 80,000 man-made chemicals in everyday use and we don't know how many of them are capable of interfering with natural hormone functions in man or animals. According to a recent report on EDCs by the Royal Society, the US is to screen about 15,000 chemicals for endocrine-disrupting activity. Such tests, however, may not identify the long-term effects of these chemicals on reproductive development when cause and consequence may be separated by a considerable length of time. </p> <p>\"We don't know how these chemicals interact in our bodies, how our bodies degrade them, and what level of exposure is required before any adverse effects arise,\" says John Sumpter from Brunel University. He has spent many years surveying intersex fish in British rivers. \"What happens in a test tube does not necessarily happen in real life, but we cannot dismiss the issue.\" </p> <p>But \"based on the evidence we have before us\", reflects Richard Sharpe, \"I would not discount the possibility.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Small children who are doubly incontinent can tell the difference between a triceratops and a tyrannosaurus. It is as if their brains have raced ahead of their widdly bits. Variation in developmental timing, in which different parts of a creature develop at different rates, is not confined to young humans. Ernst Haeckel, Darwin's biggest fan in Germany, recognised that the process could have been important in evolution, and named it \"heterochrony\". </p> <p>For most of the past century, heterochrony has been seen as one of the most important agents of evolutionary change. In 1977, the Harvard evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould published a book, Ontogeny and Phylogeny, in which he re-affirmed the theory. </p> <p>It is easy to see why heterochrony is important: adult organisms represent the final working out of a long series of processes and events starting with the fertilisation of a single cell, the egg. In terms of embryology, it is hard to see how evolutionary change can occur without perturbing this process in some way. On the other hand, each stage of development depends critically on preceding events, so more than a little disturbance can be fatal. One way to nudge development into a different pathway is to alter not the nature of any developmental event, but its timing. </p> <p>Classic cases of heterochrony in action include the axolotl, a Mexican salamander that becomes sexually mature while still in the larval stage. In 1928, the marine biologist Walter Garstang suggested that all vertebrates - backboned animals, including humans - were, in a metaphorical sense, axolotls. He supposed that, long ago, the tadpole-like larvae of sessile sea creatures, called sea squirt, could have become sexually mature, reproducing to create more tadpoles and eliminating the sea-squirt stage from their life history.

      "bodyText": "Small children who are doubly incontinent can tell the difference between a triceratops and a tyrannosaurus. It is as if their brains have raced ahead of their widdly bits. Variation in developmental timing, in which different parts of a creature develop at different rates, is not confined to young humans. Ernst Haeckel, Darwin's biggest fan in Germany, recognised that the process could have been important in evolution, and named it \"heterochrony\". For most of the past century, heterochrony has been seen as one of the most important agents of evolutionary change. In 1977, the Harvard evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould published a book, Ontogeny and Phylogeny, in which he re-affirmed the theory. It is easy to see why heterochrony is important: adult organisms represent the final working out of a long series of processes and events starting with the fertilisation of a single cell, the egg. In terms of embryology, it is hard to see how evolutionary change can occur without perturbing this process in some way. On the other hand, each stage of development depends critically on preceding events, so more than a little disturbance can be fatal. One way to nudge development into a different pathway is to alter not the nature of any developmental event, but its timing. Classic cases of heterochrony in action include the axolotl, a Mexican salamander that becomes sexually mature while still in the larval stage. In 1928, the marine biologist Walter Garstang suggested that all vertebrates - backboned animals, including humans - were, in a metaphorical sense, axolotls. He supposed that, long ago, the tadpole-like larvae of sessile sea creatures, called sea squirt, could have become sexually mature, reproducing to create more tadpoles and eliminating the sea-squirt stage from their life history. These tadpoles evolved into the first fishes. Closer to home, anthropologists looked at the human form and suggested that human adults have more in common with immature than adult apes. In other words, human beings are simply apes that never grow up. This idea is explored with grisly relish in the novel After Many A Summer, in which the fifth Earl of Gonister and his mistress, Kate, fed mostly on an elixir of raw fish guts, live for more than 200 years - and turn into apes.

Macster has now been adopted as the official Mac client for Napster, meaning faster updates for Mac users. You can download the Mac software from www.napster.com/mac. (NM) Bluetooth arrives Toshiba claims it is the first vendor to make Bluetooth wireless products commercially available In the UK - it has certainly been the first to ship working samples to Online. The Bluetooth PC Card is a network card that enables a notebook PC to be linked wirelessly to other Bluetooth devices, including computers, mobile phones, handheld organisers and printers, when these become available. It costs \u00a3125 plus VAT. Toshiba was a founder member of the multi-vendor group that developed Bluetooth as an industry standard. Chips chopped Intel has slashed the price of its top-end processors to prepare the way for the Pentium 4, which is expected to appear later this month. The price of Pentium III chips running at 800MHz to 1GHz has been slashed by more than 30%. Prices of low-end Celeron processors have also been dropped, the 700MHz Celeron version falling by 36% to $88, so now all Celerons cost less than $100 in quantities of 1,000 or more. However, the prices of some low end chips were only cut by 5-7%. Intel is expected to announce 1.4GHz and 1.5GHz Pentium 4 chips costing $625 and $795 on November 20. Lower processor prices should result in cheaper PCs in the shops. First video cellphone Geo Interactive Media, from Israel, and Samsung Electronics, from Korea, have announced the world's first commercial MPEG4 streaming video cellphone. The phone uses Geo's Emblaze A2 video chip to play video streamed over GSM and CDMA mobile phone networks. The speed, image size and quality depend on the network bandwidth available but Geo says the phone will work with \"2G, 2.5G and 3G technologies\". UK mobile phone networks are at the 1G (first generation) level with the first 2G systems based on GPRS (general packet radio service) just coming into use. Notebook camera Sony has launched a 45g video camera that will enable notebook PC users to take up videoconferencing, if they can plug it into a USB serial port. The CMR-PC1 camera is designed to slot on to the top of the LCD screen and can be swivelled through 210 degrees to face away from the user. It offers VGA resolution (640 by 480 pixels) and delivers up to 30 frames per second for only \u00a399.99 including VAT. See www.sony-cp.com/camera (JS)",

The England and Wales Cricket Board said Stewart had never met the bookmaker and was willing to cooperate with any inquiry. The long-awaited report, compiled by India's Central Bureau of Investigation, confronted the international cricket authorities with their gravest crisis yet, appearing to confirm that match-fixing has been endemic in India - and ensnared cricketers from other Test countries, including England, West Indies and New Zealand. Mohammad Azharuddin, a former Indian captain, admits his part in throwing three matches, while the former West Indian captain, Brian Lara, is also implicated. Former Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Condon, head of the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit, is to investigate the claims against Stewart and eight other cricketers who are alleged to have been involved in match-fixing or supplying information to bookmakers. The ECB promised full co-operation but said Stewart would not be suspended and would remain on the current tour of Pakistan. According to the Indian report, Stewart was paid by Indian bookmaker Mukesh Gupta in return for supplying information on pitch and weather conditions during England's tour of India and Sri Lanka in 1993. Hansie Cronje, the former South African captain banned for life, earlier admitted receiving \u00a326,500 from Mukesh Gupta to fix a Test match. The ECB said: \"Alec Stewart has fully cooperated with the ECB over this matter, and has categorically denied to Lord MacLaurin, chairman of the ECB, and Tim Lamb, chief executive, that he has ever taken money from Mr Gupta or anyone else, for providing information related to a cricket match.\"",

      "bodyText": "There was good news for shareholders in online computer games specialist Gameplay yesterday as prestigious investment bank Goldman Sachs began coverage of the firm. Goldman rated the stock as a \"market performer\" and said Gameplay traded at an unjustified discount to the European e-commerce sector. In the longer term Goldman reckons the company is well placed to cash in on the emergence of digital distribution in the games industry. Gameplay customers can, for example, play many of its titles online, something that will improve as broadband communication technologies become the norm. However, Gameplay needs to raise an additional \u00a324m to see it through to profitability. Goldman estimates its \u00a348m cash pile will run out in six to seven quarters. Gameplay shares closed yesterday some 3.5p higher at 194.5p.",

      "bodyText": "Leaders of nationalist Ireland closed ranks yesterday to defy an attempt by David Trimble to ban Sinn Fein from attending a special cross-border ministerial council set up by the Good Friday agreement. Amid fears that the peace process could be unravelling, the Irish cabinet gave the go-ahead to its health minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin, to join his Sinn Fein counterpart, Bairbre de Br\u00fan, at a meeting of the council tomorrow. Seamus Mallon, the Social Democratic and Labour party deputy first minister in Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive, underlined his fury with the Ulster Unionists by announcing that he would clear his diary to attend the meeting in Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh. Mr Trimble last night dismissed the meeting, which is meant to launch a cross-border food safety agency, as a \"face-saving device\" for Sinn Fein. However, the decision of the Irish government and the SDLP to throw their collective weight behind Sinn Fein demonstrates the determination of nationalists to confront the Ulster Unionist leader. Mr Mallon, who decided to attend the meeting after a frosty meeting with Mr Trimble at Stormont yesterday, accused the UUP leader of \"flying in the face\" of the Good Friday agreement. Mr Trimble sparked off the crisis on Saturday when he defeated a challenge from hardline unionists by pledging to ban Sinn Fein ministers from attending meetings of the north-south ministerial council. His move was designed to punish the IRA for its \"failure\" to live up to its commitments on disarmament. Sinn Fein and the Irish government conceded yesterday that tomorrow's meeting would not be a formal meeting of the cross-border council because Mr Trimble, along with Mr Mallon, has the right to veto any minister from attending the body. It will instead be a bilateral meeting which will discuss health issues, ranging from the new food safety agency to a cross-border campaign to warn women who are attempting to become pregnant to take folic acid as a precaution against spina bifida. Ms de Br\u00fan said she was determined to press ahead with the Enniskillen meeting to show that Mr Trimble would not be allowed to \"play party politics\" with health. Her remarks were echoed by Mr Mallon who said he would be attending tomorrow's meeting to protect the \"integrity and operation\" of the cross-border bodies. He also rounded on Mr Trimble for refusing to agree to an emergency meeting of the power-sharing executive to discuss the crisis. \"As it stands, the first minister is vetoing a meeting of one of the institutions - the executive - and vetoing attendance of the responsible minister at another institution, the north-south ministerial council,\" Mr Mallon said. \"This flies in the face of a central element of the Good Friday agreement - that unionists and nationalists will operate these institutions in partnership.\" The Northern Ireland Office declined to comment on the decision to go ahead with tomorrow's meeting, saying that the cross-border body is run by Dublin and by the devolved institutions in Belfast.

      "bodyText": "Britain's love affair with Wallace and Gromit has now helped the cartoon characters' favourite cheese make its mark as a national favourite. The irresistible rise of Wensleydale cheese has reached new heights with the takeover of its makers' only serious rival. Less than 10 years after the Yorkshire village of Hawes rescued the Wensleydale creamery from closure by its then London owners, the cheesemakers have topped a five-fold expansion with the purchase of Fountain's Dairy at nearby Kirkby Malzeard. The move will allow new facilities for Cranberry Wensleydale, a Gromit favourite invented after the firm's revival which now outsells all other blended British cheeses. The merged companies will employ 175 people nine years after the Hawes workforce fell to a low of 11. The turnaround is one of the most romantic stories in the history of the cheese, whose many dramas go back to the French monks of Jervaulx abbey who developed Wensleydale in the 11th century. Bankrupted three times in the past 60 years, the creamery survived such indignities as the dumping of five tonnes of unsold cheese down a local lead mine and the wartime diversion of milk to make chocolate for the armed forces. The key figure in the cheese's modern history was Kit Calvert, a Wensleydale farmer and polymath who united warring local cheesemakers into a 1950s co-op which included both Hawes and Kirkby Malzeard. His spirit was invoked in 1992 when Dairy Crest, then the commercial arm of the Milk Marketing Board, decided to close down Hawes and make Wensleydale - unthinkably - in Lancashire. Protests, including a stony-faced boycott of the cycling milk race which was sponsored by Dairy Crest and fortuitously passed through Hawes, led to a David and Goliath victory and the start of targeted marketing after a management buyout.

      "bodyText": "A 34-year-old man who killed his former wife and their two young children in a frenzied knife attack was given three life sentences yesterday. After an eight day trial, Zainulabedin Zaidi was convicted of three counts of murder by a jury at Reading crown court. Zaidi, a former banker, stabbed his ex-wife Shazia, 27, to death in front of their seven-year-old daughter Saba, and six-year-old son Zeeshan, before slitting both children's throats at their home in Great Hollands, Bracknell, Berkshire, on March 17 this year. After the verdicts Detective Superintendent Trevor Davies, of Thames Valley police, dismissed Zaidi as \"a pathetic excuse for a human being\". He condemned him for having pleaded not guilty when the evidence against him was so overwhelming. The scene of crime had been \"one of the most appalling sights I have ever seen\", Mr Davies said. During the trial the jury was played a tape of the 999 call made by one of the children during the killings. On the tape a child's voice was heard pleading: \"Don't kill me, daddy\", then telling the operator: \"My dad is getting my mum and stabbing and killing me.\" Zaidi, from Slough, Berkshire, was in a jealous rage after his arranged Muslim marriage had irretrievably broken down and his former wife had re-married in a secret ceremony, the court was told. Adrian Redgrave QC, prosecuting, said Zaidi murdered his children \"in cold blood\" and that \"the conclusion is in escapable - the child that was last to die must have witnessed not only the killing of their mother but also the other child\". After the killings, Zaidi bought a curry then sought refuge with a friend in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. He was arrested the following day after nationwide appeals as to his whereabouts. Zaidi refused to give evidence during the trial and refused to speak to detectives, constantly maintaining his right to silence. During hours of interviews the only sentence he uttered was: \"I did not murder my wife and two children.\" Forensic evidence linked him to the murders - his former wife's blood found spattered on his shoes and watch. The jury took two and a half-hours to return a unanimous verdict of guilty on all three murders. Passing the three life sentences, Mr Justice Moses told Zaidi: \"I am quite satisfied you came armed with a knife. \"Once in the house you stabbed and cut Shazia's throat. You then stabbed and cut the throats of your son and daughter. They knew what you were about to do.\" Outside the court, Shazia's family issued a statement saying: \"We are relieved that justice has been served, however this doesn't ease our grief of losing our three cherished loved ones. \"The only comfort we have is that they are happy together in heaven, in peace, and finally free from the misery and torment he brought to their lives.\" Press Association",

Tony Woodley, the TGWU's chief car industry negotiator, said the suspension would enable both sides to remove any \"abuses\" in the scheme and develop a new one that would be acceptable to the workforces at Solihull and Gaydon. \"Flexibility has to be more user friendly, and under this agreement our members will be given a chance to review the deal without duress,\" he said.

Since a new management team took over two and a half years ago, Hepworth has sold its air filtration business, its ladder business in France and its mineral and chemical operations. Analysts expect that it may also sell its building materials division, which largely makes pipes.",

An elderly couple leave their quiet provincial home to visit their children in chaotic Tokyo, but find son and daughter far too busily self-centred to look after them. Beautifully portrayed and deeply affecting - simplicity bordering on the magical. </p> <p><strong> Wild At Heart</strong> </p> <p>(David Lynch, 1990) </p> <p>10.40pm, FilmFour </p> <p>The horrible opening in which Nicolas Cage's petty crook Sailor Ripley smashes in the skull of a would-be killer sets the bizarre, dark tone of Lynch's sub-Blue Velvet tale. Cage and Laura Dern's Lula are lovers on the run through a weird American South - stalked by a hitman hired by the mother-in-law-from-hell Marietta (Diane Ladd). A road movie with a vengeance, it's full of Lynch's demonic humour, energy and disturbed violence, and won the Palme d'Or at Cannes.

      "bodyText": "Tokyo Story (Yasujiro Ozu, 1953) 6pm, FilmFour One of the great Japanese director's finest works, full of the drama of family life. An elderly couple leave their quiet provincial home to visit their children in chaotic Tokyo, but find son and daughter far too busily self-centred to look after them. Beautifully portrayed and deeply affecting - simplicity bordering on the magical. Wild At Heart (David Lynch, 1990) 10.40pm, FilmFour The horrible opening in which Nicolas Cage's petty crook Sailor Ripley smashes in the skull of a would-be killer sets the bizarre, dark tone of Lynch's sub-Blue Velvet tale. Cage and Laura Dern's Lula are lovers on the run through a weird American South - stalked by a hitman hired by the mother-in-law-from-hell Marietta (Diane Ladd). A road movie with a vengeance, it's full of Lynch's demonic humour, energy and disturbed violence, and won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. The ace cast includes Willem Dafoe's throbbing Bobby Peru and Isabella Rossellini as his hot girlfriend, Perdita. Jackie Brown (Quentin Tarantino, 1997) 11.50pm, Sky Premier Pulp punk Tarantino's coming-of-age movie. An adaptation of Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch, it's an assured account of Pam Grier's middle-aged heroine, a stewardess with a past trying to make a living, then a killing, in a meticulously recreated 70s LA gangsterland.

The leading protagonist in terms of the US elections is the columnist of the Spectator and the Telegraph papers, Mark Steyn. Since midsummer he has been asserting - with what friends would see as consummate courage and detractors as raving foolhardiness - that Bush cannot be beaten. On September 15, he even put figures on his prediction: Bush would take at least 378 of the 538 seats in the electoral college. \"I figure my prediction can withstand pretty much anything this side of a third world war,\" he added.

This fraternity - all in their different ways building on polling evidence but mixing in economic portents and voters' feelings about how well off they are compared to last year - were all agreed that Gore was going to win 53 to 60% of the total vote cast for him plus Bush. Conspicuous among them was Michael Lewis-Beck of the University of Iowa, who forecast Mr Gore winning 56.2% of the two-party vote. A modest man, he admits to having got things wrong in the 1996 election. He gave Clinton 54.8% of the two-party vote. The electors gave him 54.7%.</p> <p>We have predestinarians here too. In recent months, the esteemed political analyst Peter Kellner has teamed up with their leading representative, Professor David Sanders of Essex University, to produce for the Observer a \"Kellner-Sanders Index\" which weights the opinion polls according to past performance and adds in such factors as consumer confidence. \"Despite recent wobbles,\" Kellner wrote when they launched it on July 2, \"Labour holds an 11-point lead and is on course for a big victory next year, unless Britain's economy hits trouble.\" Not as bold as Steyn, who requires a world war to upset his predictions, but still pretty confident stuff.</p> <p>And they could very well be right. And yet I have before me the results of an exercise at the 1997 election when various pundits were asked by Reuter to forecast Labour's likely majority.

The most powerful elected job in the universe seems likely to go to a man who, though broadly recognised as nowhere near as good on the issues as Gore, is seen as much the more likeable guy.

      "body": "<p>Apparently Brian Stewart, chairman of <strong> Scottish &amp; Newcastle,</strong> cannot understand why the share price of his company is low. </p> <p>Despite being of one Europe's biggest beer companies and making more than \u00a3400m of profit last year the Edinburgh-based company has a miserly stock market rating and is not even a FTSE 100 constituent anymore - it was relegated at the last index review. </p> <p>Indeed Mr Stewart's competitors cannot understand it either. However, instead of ruminating on the injustices of the stock market some are said to be preparing to do something about it. </p> <p>According to the market gossips one of S&amp;N's main rivals is poised to take advantage of its lowly share price by making a takeover offer. The names being mentioned in City dealing rooms yesterday were Dutch brewer Heineken and <strong> South African Breweries </strong> , 14p higher at 429p. </p> <p>Heineken recently signalled its intention to expand further overseas and SAB, according to analysts, is desperate to muscle its way into western Europe. </p> <p>For a predator intent on increasing its international presence the attractions of S&amp;N are evident. Earlier this year S&amp;N bought Kronenbourg from French beer manufacturer Danone for \u00a31.7bn with the aim of making it into a global brand. It followed that purchase with the acquisition of a 49% stake in Central De Cervejas, a Portuguese beer company. </p> <p>Moreover, S&amp;N is also in the process of selling its leisure operations Center Parcs and Pontins, which in the past has been viewed by potential predators as something of a poison pill. </p> <p>S&amp;N refused to comment on the speculation but the shares closed 9.5p higher at 482p giving some credence to the story. </p> <p>However, sources close to S&amp;N indicated that US value investors were taking a keen interest in the group snapping up any stock on offer in the marketplace. </p> <p>Leading shares meanwhile experienced another volatile session in which the FTSE 100 rose above 6,500, fell below 6,400, and then finished at a seven-week closing high. </p> <p>At the close the FTSE 100 was 19.2 points higher at 6,457.6, while the FTSE 250 rose 53.8 points to 6,683.1 and the Techmark was 40.68 points better at 3,431.39. </p> <p>Behind the volatility were wildly conflicting performances from the market's three biggest sectors: telecoms, banks and oils. </p> <p>After a bright start, telecom shares lurched sharply lower after US company WorldCom, a big player in the long-distance telecoms market, cut its revenue and profit forecasts. Worst affected by the news were UK equivalents <strong> Energis </strong>, down 40.5p to 549p, and <strong> Cable &amp; Wireless </strong>, off 45p to 930p.

      "bodyText": "Apparently Brian Stewart, chairman of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, cannot understand why the share price of his company is low. Despite being of one Europe's biggest beer companies and making more than \u00a3400m of profit last year the Edinburgh-based company has a miserly stock market rating and is not even a FTSE 100 constituent anymore - it was relegated at the last index review. Indeed Mr Stewart's competitors cannot understand it either. However, instead of ruminating on the injustices of the stock market some are said to be preparing to do something about it. According to the market gossips one of S&amp;N's main rivals is poised to take advantage of its lowly share price by making a takeover offer. The names being mentioned in City dealing rooms yesterday were Dutch brewer Heineken and South African Breweries , 14p higher at 429p. Heineken recently signalled its intention to expand further overseas and SAB, according to analysts, is desperate to muscle its way into western Europe. For a predator intent on increasing its international presence the attractions of S&amp;N are evident. Earlier this year S&amp;N bought Kronenbourg from French beer manufacturer Danone for \u00a31.7bn with the aim of making it into a global brand. It followed that purchase with the acquisition of a 49% stake in Central De Cervejas, a Portuguese beer company. Moreover, S&amp;N is also in the process of selling its leisure operations Center Parcs and Pontins, which in the past has been viewed by potential predators as something of a poison pill. S&amp;N refused to comment on the speculation but the shares closed 9.5p higher at 482p giving some credence to the story. However, sources close to S&amp;N indicated that US value investors were taking a keen interest in the group snapping up any stock on offer in the marketplace. Leading shares meanwhile experienced another volatile session in which the FTSE 100 rose above 6,500, fell below 6,400, and then finished at a seven-week closing high. At the close the FTSE 100 was 19.2 points higher at 6,457.6, while the FTSE 250 rose 53.8 points to 6,683.1 and the Techmark was 40.68 points better at 3,431.39. Behind the volatility were wildly conflicting performances from the market's three biggest sectors: telecoms, banks and oils. After a bright start, telecom shares lurched sharply lower after US company WorldCom, a big player in the long-distance telecoms market, cut its revenue and profit forecasts. Worst affected by the news were UK equivalents Energis , down 40.5p to 549p, and Cable &amp; Wireless , off 45p to 930p. But there was also pain for Vodafone , 10p lower at 276.75p and BT , 18p weaker at 709p. Nevertheless Telewest , the cable and telecoms company, managed to buck the trend putting on 11.25p to 125.25p as bid speculation continued to swirl around the stock. The latest tale centred around an approach from Dutch group UPC. The more sceptical believed Telewest was looking cheap in the run up to third-quarter figures due later this month. BP rose 12.5p to 597p, while Shell gained 7.5p to 562p. HSBC climbed 17p to 999p and Royal Bank of Scotland rose 23p to \u00a315.70. Also rising were fund management groups Amvescap , up 115p to \u00a316.55, and Schroders , 58p higher at \u00a313.05, both benefiting from positive comments made by Lehman Brothers. IT services group Logica fell 104p to \u00a319.35 on talk Morgan Stanley was trying to find buyers for a block of 4.7m shares. Building materials group Hepworth leapt 47p to 270.5p on news of bid approaches. Newcomer Charteris had a good debut run. Shares in the management consultancy closed at 116.5p, up 26.5p from their issue price.",

At the heart of the debate is the threat which is posed to the Staatsoper's orchestra, the Staatskapelle, known as a leading symphony orchestra in its own right.

Even French actresses have never really gone in for the casting couch system. If you are a French starlet, the deal is you remain faithful to a French \"auteur\".</p> <p>Even when action does take place, it is done in such a goddam refined way. Take the American Natalie Clifford Barney, one of the most famous lesbians of the 1930s. Her literary salon welcomed guests such as TS Eliot, James Joyce, Djuna Barnes, Gertrude Stein and Dolly Wilde, the niece of Oscar. According to a new biography of Wilde, the women's extracurricular activities were as rampant as their literary ones, with Wilde having to perform \"emergency seductions\" when she got bored and Barney keeping lists of her conquests under the categories liaison, demi-liaison and aventure. This sounds promising until you read on and find out that Barney had a habit of delivering herself to potential partners wrapped up in a large box of white lilies and riding her glass carriage though the streets in the early hours to sing opera tunes under the balconies of other lucky lovers.</p> <p>Ann-Marie Harper, a 33-year-old Englishwoman who has lived in Paris for the past eight years with Pierre, says her partner is often scandalised when he overhears her conversations with girlfriends. \"He says: 'But why are you so vulgaire? You talk about cocks and things, you are very indiscr\u00e8te.'</p> <p>\"Frenchmen seem to think it weird if you want to have a good time with other girls without them,\" Harper adds. \"And they are shocked that Englishwomen drink so much.\" Alcohol, she adds, is probably at the heart of British joie de vivre.</p> <p>Marie Darrieussecq, the first Frenchwoman novelist of recent years to write about sex as something dirty and unaesthetic, in her bestseller Pig Tales, agrees with the alcohol theory. She says she first noticed the difference between French and British versions of joie de vivre when, aged 14, she went to visit a penfriend in the north of England. \"We went to the pub and there was this group of men having a stag party. The English get a little crazy when they drink. Suddenly a female stripper entered the room and began to do her act. Everyone thought this was very funny. In France this would never happen. Strippers in public are considered vulgaire.\"</p> <p>The difference in approach to sex she pins down to the political climate of the 18th century. \"In France, salon culture developed during a time of peace and leisure. There was time for refined flirtation and intellectual intrigue. England at the same time was more interested in fighting wars.\"</p> <p>But it looks as though Godot might be around the corner after all. Darrieussecq mentions the recent kerfuffle caused by Baise-Moi, a film by her friend Virginie Despentes about two sexually predatory girls. It became a succ\u00e8s de scandale this summer when the far-right organisation Promouvoir banned it from cinemas in France, calling it obscene and anti-male.</p> <p>Another film-maker, Catherine Breillat, has become known for her film Romance, about a woman who goes around Paris compulsively having sex to try to get over the love she feels for her boyfriend. Poetic sex is anathema to Breillat. \"Even when sex is sordid,\" she recently told Liberation, \"there is a beauty in the sordid. The so-called erotic is about humiliation of women. It is seen as acceptable because it is 'pretty'. Pornography is ugly. I prefer the ugly.\"</p> <p>This autumn saw the release of a film Breillat made in 1975 (it was considered too risqu\u00e9 to show at the time). Called Une Vraie Jeune Fille (A Real Young Girl), it is about a teenager who can't stop thinking about sex. It opens at her bourgeois parents' house where the teenager is trying to masturbate under the dinner table with a spoon.</p> <p>There are further signs that the French are becoming more brave about being vulgaire. The other contemporary author making a splash is Michel Houellebecq, a French Bret Easton Ellis. The French love their existential crises and this is what Houellebecq writes about - people having weird sex because their lives are so meaningless that that is all they can do (and even that they don't do very well).</p> <p>Darrieussecq concludes that the trouble with the British is that they are too obsessed with sex per se. The true French lover, she insists, is an all-round sensualist. \"I am just as interested in describing what a piece of chocolate tastes like as I am in evoking how a great orgasm feels.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Stephanie Theobald's novel Biche is published by Flame, priced \u00a310.99.</p>",

You talk about cocks and things, you are very indiscr\u00e8te.' \"Frenchmen seem to think it weird if you want to have a good time with other girls without them,\" Harper adds. \"And they are shocked that Englishwomen drink so much.\" Alcohol, she adds, is probably at the heart of British joie de vivre. Marie Darrieussecq, the first Frenchwoman novelist of recent years to write about sex as something dirty and unaesthetic, in her bestseller Pig Tales, agrees with the alcohol theory. She says she first noticed the difference between French and British versions of joie de vivre when, aged 14, she went to visit a penfriend in the north of England. \"We went to the pub and there was this group of men having a stag party. The English get a little crazy when they drink. Suddenly a female stripper entered the room and began to do her act. Everyone thought this was very funny. In France this would never happen. Strippers in public are considered vulgaire.\" The difference in approach to sex she pins down to the political climate of the 18th century. \"In France, salon culture developed during a time of peace and leisure. There was time for refined flirtation and intellectual intrigue. England at the same time was more interested in fighting wars.\" But it looks as though Godot might be around the corner after all. Darrieussecq mentions the recent kerfuffle caused by Baise-Moi, a film by her friend Virginie Despentes about two sexually predatory girls. It became a succ\u00e8s de scandale this summer when the far-right organisation Promouvoir banned it from cinemas in France, calling it obscene and anti-male. Another film-maker, Catherine Breillat, has become known for her film Romance, about a woman who goes around Paris compulsively having sex to try to get over the love she feels for her boyfriend. Poetic sex is anathema to Breillat. \"Even when sex is sordid,\" she recently told Liberation, \"there is a beauty in the sordid. The so-called erotic is about humiliation of women. It is seen as acceptable because it is 'pretty'. Pornography is ugly. I prefer the ugly.\" This autumn saw the release of a film Breillat made in 1975 (it was considered too risqu\u00e9 to show at the time). Called Une Vraie Jeune Fille (A Real Young Girl), it is about a teenager who can't stop thinking about sex. It opens at her bourgeois parents' house where the teenager is trying to masturbate under the dinner table with a spoon. There are further signs that the French are becoming more brave about being vulgaire. The other contemporary author making a splash is Michel Houellebecq, a French Bret Easton Ellis. The French love their existential crises and this is what Houellebecq writes about - people having weird sex because their lives are so meaningless that that is all they can do (and even that they don't do very well). Darrieussecq concludes that the trouble with the British is that they are too obsessed with sex per se. The true French lover, she insists, is an all-round sensualist. \"I am just as interested in describing what a piece of chocolate tastes like as I am in evoking how a great orgasm feels.\" \u0095 Stephanie Theobald's novel Biche is published by Flame, priced \u00a310.99.",

In a decade that saw some of the greatest batsmen in history, he scored more runs than any of them. His fastidious nature, with its almost obsessive attention to neatness and a clean-cut image, belies a toughness of character beneath. He plays cricket to the edge of gamesmanship at times and perhaps beyond that. Off the field he has also had to undergo difficult times when Lynne, his wife, suffered serious illness. He might conceivably have captained England on a record number of times, but when the job was up for grabs following Graham Gooch's resignation in 1994, it went to Mike Atherton. Stewart was viewed by some as having canvassed too hard for the position. There was always the underlying feeling that his best role was as a second in command, a supplier of ideas without executive responsibility. And there was also the sneaking fear among the England hierarchy at that time that his nose for a commercial opportunity might have made him push that side of things too hard. Admissions and denials Mohammad Azharuddin: India Age 37 Tests 99 ODIs 334 Allegation: That he confessed to fixing games for Gupta Evidence: His statement admits match-fixing in a Titan Cup match at Rajkot in 1996 and an Asia Cup match the following year Likely outcome: A lifetime ban Aravinda de Silva: Sri Lanka Age 35 Tests 85 ODIs 268 Allegation: Gupta claimed De Silva had helped fix an Indian victory in the Lucknow Test in 1994, for $15,000 Evidence: No corroboration Likely outcome: Sri Lanka board said it would \"most likely\" initiate a criminal inquiry Arjuna Ranatunga: Sri Lanka Age 36 Tests 93 ODIs 269 Allegation: Gupta claimed Ranatunga had helped fix an Indian victory in the 1994 Lucknow Test. There has been no claim of payment Evidence: Uncorroborated. He denies any involvement Likely outcome: Uncertain Salim Malik: Pakistan Age 37 Tests 103 ODIs 283 Allegation: That he was offered money by Gupta Evidence: Overpowering. The Qayyum inquiry, an intensive investigation by the Pakistan judiciary, found Malik guilty of match-fixing. Clinching evidence included that given by Shane Warne and Mark Waugh about bribery attempts. Likely outcome: Life ban continues Asif Iqbal: Pakistan Age 57 Tests 58 ODIs 10 Allegation: Involvement with bookmakers Evidence: The Qayyum commission concluded: \"The allegation of match-fixing seems to have started when Asif Iqbal was captain in 1979-80.\" He was accused of betting on the result of a toss in a Test against India. Likely outcome: Another small nail, but no sign of a coffin Martin Crowe: New Zealand Age 38 Tests 77 ODI s143 Allegation: Named by Gupta as having taken $20,000 for pitch, weather and team information, but that he had shunned offers to fix matches Evidence: Crowe said he thought he was writing a captain's diary for Indian news outlets Likely outcome: Undamaged reputation, as long as his version remains accepted Brian Lara: West Indies Age 31 Tests 70 ODIs 173 Allegation: Gupta says he paid Lara $40,000 to under-perform in two one-day matches during the tour of India in 1995 Evidence: Uncorroborated Likely outcome: Unknown Hansie Cronje: South Africa Age 31 Tests 68 ODIs 188 Allegation: Gupta admitted paying $40,000 to Cronje during the Kanpur Test to ensure a South African loss Evidence: Cronje has testified Gupta paid him to fix matches Likely outcome: Lifetime ban will remain",

Once in a House on Fire by Andrea Ashworth</strong><br>An account of growing up with domestic violence that is harrowing and crystal clear, yet somehow still funny, brave and illuminating. No self-pity, no bitter feelings, just triumph over adversity.</p> <p><strong>2. Remind Me Who I Am Again by Linda Grant</strong><br>Grant's sister, Michele, hoped that this moving and beautifully written account of their mother's dementia would help others who live through such an experience to \"feel just a little bit less alone\". I'm sure that it will.</p> <p><strong>3. The Stone Diaries by Carol Shields</strong><br>The true story of Daisy Goodwill, whose mother, herself an orphan, died in childbirth at the very beginning of this book. She lasted only 40 pages but I can still almost feel her physical presence. So Daisy grows up without a mother. Poignant, funny, ordinary life made extraordinary.</p> <p><strong>4. Portnoy's Complaint by Phillip Roth</strong><br>I'm cheating slightly here, as these books are meant to be about mothers and daughters, but Portnoy has the mother of all mothers. Puts my mother in the shade. Slightly. For which I will always be grateful. I thought it tremendously funny. My mother did not.</p> <p><strong>5. Skating to Antarctica by Jenny Diski</strong><br>Vivid, caustic and compelling story of two journeys, one through Diski's bleak and messy childhood, the other out to comparatively clean and empty Antarctica. For thirty years Diski has not wanted to know about her mother. Now she finds out.</p> <p><strong>6. Clarissa by Samuel Richardson</strong><br>Lock up your daughter because she won't marry the oaf of your choice and she's bound to run off with a duplicitous rake, as Clarissa did. Richardson was a vicar who listened carefully to women and seemed to understand what they felt. But he couldn't quite deal with rape (or was it?) and so Clarissa dies of what appears to be a severe attack of the religious vapours. However, the rest of the book is utterly gripping and it is the first woman's confessional (epistolary) novel.</p> <p><strong>7. Shamela by Henry Fielding</strong><br>A brilliant parody of Richardson's Pamela (not a patch on Clarissa). Shamela's mother is a member of the oldest profession and Shamela is herself rather cavalier with her affections and her new husband's money, but she does manage to write letters like billy ho, what ever else is going on. I laughed out loud. And, as usual, Fielding's prose is sublime. The only snag is that one needs to read a little of prissy Pamela first, but it's definitely worth it.</p> <p><strong>8. Oranges are Not the Only Fruit by Jeanette Winterson</strong><br>The story of a young girl living in an evangelical household, who falls in love with another young girl. Makes something huge, colourful, humourous, light, airy and profound from a situation that you might expect to be pinched, dull and mean.</p> <p><strong>9. Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen</strong><br>What a worry daughters are. This has everything: greed, poverty, romance, suffering, snobbery and love. It makes the commonplace fascinating, is utterly gripping and exquisitely written.</p> <p><strong>10. Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole</strong><br>I couldn't resist one more son. Our hero, Ignatius J Rielly, is a huge, dreadful and magnificent slob. He is intellectual, tormented by flatulence, enraged with the modern world, and must find a job when his mother's welfare money runs out. His only relationship is with his mother. Naturally, she still loves him. Set in New Orleans, this is a riotous, evocative, breathtakingly witty and superbly written book with a cast of hugely colourful characters. It is also heartrending. Ignacius is a spectacular failure at everything. And, tragically, J Kennedy Toole committed suicide at 32.</p>",

      "body": "<p>City traders took a bet yesterday that UK interest rates are about to fall after new figures showed consumers and manufacturers tightening their belts, a warning of slower economic growth to come. </p> <p>Heavy discounting by retailers failed to attract customers on to the high streets last month, according to the Confederation of British Industry. Its latest snapshot of the retail sector showed sales growth was flat in October, after growing robustly the previous month and the first pause in growth since January 1999. </p> <p>\"Retail trading conditions are still tough and this standstill in sales highlights the fragility of the situation,\" said Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel. \"Competitive pressures remain strong and price cuts continue unabated.\" </p> <p>Manufacturing output slowed as well, according to a separate survey of the sector by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which showed the first decline in activity for 18 months. Although orders and output improved, the Cips activity index was dragged down by declining supply times as the delays caused by September's fuel protests lifted. </p> <p>\"[Manufacturing output] is keeping its head above water but only just. This certainly supports the growing feeling that rates may have peaked or that if the MPC raises rates again, it won't do so until early next year,\" said Fraser Coutts at 4Cast. </p> <p>Traders seized on evidence the economy is slowing, pushing up short sterling futures, a market guide to future levels of UK interest rates, to signal falling rates after weeks of sitting on the fence. </p> <p>A few weeks ago the market was betting that interest rates had peaked around 6% , taking its cue from a wealth of data showing subdued prices and tentative signs that economic growth was levelling off. </p> <p>However, traders were reluctant to price in a cut in rates, because the members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee voted unanimously in favour of keeping rates on hold at their October meeting. </p> <p>Analysts said yesterday's figures could persuade the more dovish members of the MPC to vote for lower interest rates at their meeting next week. But the hawks will be alarmed by a sharper the expected jump in house price inflation. Nationwide building society showed house prices rising 0.9% in October, the largest monthly rise since April. Prices were 9.9% higher than a year ago. </p> <p>Signs of slower growth and the prospect of rates having peaked helped send the pound to a three week low against a reinvigorated euro. Sterling fell to 59.3p against the euro, down a 0.5p from late Tuesday levels and its weakest since October 12. </p> <p>The euro reached a two-week high against the dollar yesterday, closing in London above 86 cents, buoyed by further evidence the US economy is slowing after new figures showed manufacturing contracted for the third month in a row. </p> <p>Traders were also wary about the risks of another coordinated euro buying spree by world central banks, after Bundesbank president Ernst Welteke and US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers both hinted at intervention. </p> <p>The euro's rise against the dollar yesterday was its fifth in a row, the longest rally the single currency has sustained for more than a year. However, few traders were prepared to declare its woes are over.</p>",

Its latest snapshot of the retail sector showed sales growth was flat in October, after growing robustly the previous month and the first pause in growth since January 1999. \"Retail trading conditions are still tough and this standstill in sales highlights the fragility of the situation,\" said Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel. \"Competitive pressures remain strong and price cuts continue unabated.\" Manufacturing output slowed as well, according to a separate survey of the sector by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which showed the first decline in activity for 18 months. Although orders and output improved, the Cips activity index was dragged down by declining supply times as the delays caused by September's fuel protests lifted. \"[Manufacturing output] is keeping its head above water but only just. This certainly supports the growing feeling that rates may have peaked or that if the MPC raises rates again, it won't do so until early next year,\" said Fraser Coutts at 4Cast. Traders seized on evidence the economy is slowing, pushing up short sterling futures, a market guide to future levels of UK interest rates, to signal falling rates after weeks of sitting on the fence. A few weeks ago the market was betting that interest rates had peaked around 6% , taking its cue from a wealth of data showing subdued prices and tentative signs that economic growth was levelling off. However, traders were reluctant to price in a cut in rates, because the members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee voted unanimously in favour of keeping rates on hold at their October meeting. Analysts said yesterday's figures could persuade the more dovish members of the MPC to vote for lower interest rates at their meeting next week. But the hawks will be alarmed by a sharper the expected jump in house price inflation. Nationwide building society showed house prices rising 0.9% in October, the largest monthly rise since April. Prices were 9.9% higher than a year ago. Signs of slower growth and the prospect of rates having peaked helped send the pound to a three week low against a reinvigorated euro. Sterling fell to 59.3p against the euro, down a 0.5p from late Tuesday levels and its weakest since October 12. The euro reached a two-week high against the dollar yesterday, closing in London above 86 cents, buoyed by further evidence the US economy is slowing after new figures showed manufacturing contracted for the third month in a row. Traders were also wary about the risks of another coordinated euro buying spree by world central banks, after Bundesbank president Ernst Welteke and US treasury secretary Lawrence Summers both hinted at intervention. The euro's rise against the dollar yesterday was its fifth in a row, the longest rally the single currency has sustained for more than a year. However, few traders were prepared to declare its woes are over.",

Approaching their silver wedding anniversary, Edgar and Alice live in dreadful isolation, in a wartime fortress nicknamed Little Hell, in the midst of enemy territory. Against this bitter backdrop, they have made their own diabolical emotional territory. Both as bad as each other, at least in the first part of the play (a sequel, oddly cheery, is included in the production), they have alienated all their friends and their children with their warring to the death.

Thanks to Gregory Motton's fine new translation, and Stewart Laing's steely direction, this is done, though there were a few suppressed barks of laughter at the more melodramatic moments. These are scripted moments, however, with Strindberg unable to show tenderness here without self-conscious hamming-up. \"Where am I?\" slurs Kurt, bewildered, when Alice strokes his cheek. This gentle mood lasts for seconds only. They are soon discussing another couple on the island who also celebrated their silver wedding recently. She had to wear her ring on her right hand; he had cut the fingers off her left one with his penknife. </p> <p>The central performances give the right sense of irreversible horror. Tam Dean Burn captures Strindberg's idea of Edgar as a \"refined demon\", while Anne Marie Timoney's Alice wins and loses our sympathy, just as she should, as she rejects but then mimics Edgar's wickedness.

Gone is the gloomy horror of the room in which Edgar and Alice have awaited \"the wonderful peace of death\". In a light-flooded room, we meet Judith (Edgar and Alice's daughter) and Allan (Kurt's son), the next generation. They are the products of this violent dysfunction and yet they are redemptive figures, restoring some emotional normality at the end.

      "body": "<p>On December 2 Smashing Pumpkins play their last ever gig in their home town of Chicago, bringing one of rock's most enduring sideshows to a close. Their 12-year history has thrown up tantrums, traumas, rock death, drugs, rucks, rumours and the sometimes entertainingly ridiculous ego of frontman Billy Corgan. When their latest Spinal Tap-like bust-up led to umpteenth manager Sharon (wife of Ozzy) Osbourne dumping the band for reasons of her \"health\", she declared, pricelessly, that Corgan \"makes me sick\". </p> <p>Pumpkins always seemed closer to a cabaret act than a rock band. Always second fiddle to the raging (rather than whingeing) Nirvana, they were always too muso for grunge, too Hollyweird for metal and neither cool nor electronic enough to hack it in their disastrous 1998 incarnation as a cool electronic rock band. Corgan's preening self-importance ensured that the band limped on throughout the 1990s, but their mega-selling years were far behind them. </p> <p>For this final tour, Corgan's supporting cast includes the band's original drummer, Jimmy Chamberlin (previously sacked after being found overdosed next to a deceased keyboard player - how lovely); Hole's statuesque bassist, Melissa Auf Der Maur (replacing D'Arcy Wretzky, lately in crack rehab); and Bowie pianist Mike Garson. With barely a word spoken, they convey a sense of drama and foreboding, and a feeling that this really is the last time, and it should be. Over an often painful 90 minutes, Corgan's self-regard means that he is incapable of playing anything simple. Lumbering, notes-per-minute wailathons evoke the coked-out sprawl of Kansas and the Eagles more than alt.rock. Even occasionally beautiful guitar melodies are soon swamped by synth gurgles, China drums and Corgan's unintentional proof that more means less. </p> <p>It doesn't help that he has a voice as irritating as William Hague's. He sounds like an angst-ridden Bill Gates, even emitting the most unlistenable, androidal \"Thank yew\" in rock history. But you have to hand it to the man: balding and resembling Nosferatu, he looks better in a wedding dress then his pal, Courtney Love. With typical grandiosity, the pompous twit ( \"on vocals, guitar and craziness\" - sheesh) soaks up a full 10 minutes of cheering diehards before deigning to do an encore. Later, the band take a final bow dressed as Posh, Bald Becks and the Gallaghers for the sublime 1979, meaning that Corgan's best music is upstaged by his own sideshow. Bye bye, Billy. Don't hurry back. </p> <p> Smashing Pumpkins are at Wembley Arena (0115- 912 9000) tomorrow and Saturday. </p>",

There was no pig in it, and it never fell down the well: the title simply evoked that particular convoluted, ill-fated spell in its characters' lives. Hong specialises in slow-building narratives with a jigsaw feel, that fall gently and seductively into place if you give them time, and if you're willing to keep an eye out for the fine details of his characters' everyday traumas. </p> <p>Hong's third film - originally and more concisely titled Oh! Soojung - is another structurally intricate story, this time about urban romance. It begins in a hotel room, where awkward young Jaehoon wonders whether his girlfriend Soojung - the virgin of the title - will turn up. We skip back to the start of their relationship, through seven chapters in which the couple meet, become lovers, have their first awkward attempts at sex, fall out, reunite, and arrange their hotel rendezvous. Then, after an enigmatic interlude in a stuck cable car, Hong repeats the seven chapters, but with notable variations. We learn new things about Soojung's life, notably that she has an awkward flirtation going with her film-maker boss. And we see events taking subtly different turns: the same dinners are eaten in the same restaurants as before, but with different people getting drunk and disgracing themselves. </p> <p>Between sections, as if to mock our confusion, a jangling piano provides a mocking, sardonic commentary on the whole affair. The two versions of Jaehoon and Soojung's romance are not so much alternatives as parallels. </p> <p>Hong is interested in slight but telling differences that at once cancel out and complement each other, as if to underline the provisional nature of experience, and especially the provisional, happenstance nature of cinema's supposedly destined love stories. Hong is a film-maker in full control, and not only narratively. The film is shot in crisp, wintry black and white, and long takes allow the drama to unwind at its own sweet, unpredictable pace, often taking unexpected detours into bittersweet farce. Chilly and distant though it sometimes feels, Virgin is never less than engrossing, and, true to its devious, fragmented construction, is even more rewarding the second time. </p> <p> Screenings at the NFT today and the ICA on Saturday.

His dancers move as if blind, urgent impulses are hurtling them through space, sometimes propelling them into violent collisions, sometimes sending them along lone, driven trajectories. However, in Strange Attractors, which is Petronio's latest and most grown-up piece, it's as if that energy is at least taking weekends in the country. </p> <p>This two-part show begins very strangely with a brief, dangling prelude in which the dancers are moulded together in a kind of collective, primitive embrace. They huddle in skewed but beautifully sculpted formations, though it's hard to tell whether they're meant to be damaged survivors of some traumatic event or a loyal family, for after a few minutes they simply abandon the stage. The long pause that follows makes you wonder if Petronio hasn't lost the plot, but eventually the opening phrases of Michael Nyman's commissioned score bring the eight principal dancers back, and for the next 30 minutes the stage is filled with confidently fluid, unfettered dance. </p> <p>Nyman's music is far more spacious and lyrical than Petronio's usual choice of score, and with the men dancers wearing silky grey pyjamas and the women in little black frocks (designs by Ghost), the look of the company is far more serene than the old days of pink corsets and bondage gear. Also, where the choreography used to scorch the floor in fierce bolts of movement, it now curves in on itself in deftly organised formations. The dynamic of the dancing is fast - the dancers' limbs still whirl and jab with fearless momentum, their hips and heads moving in whiplash counterpoint - but the moves are contained within long balanced phrases, which suggests a fury held in check. </p> <p>During certain passages the dancing is so very tightly contained that you start to wonder whether the piece is heading anywhere, but the final third of this section is simply beautiful. Elements in the music - a violin solo with a Vaughan Williams shimmer and some darkly romantic piano - elicit a kind of rapture from the choreography, with some of the dancers smiling as if surrendering to the pure pleasure of moving. </p> <p>In the second half everything shifts. James Lavette's acerbic score immediately sharpens the dancers' focus, and they become even more reckless in their moves, launching into split-second jumps and catches, and dancing so hard that their bodies judder with the aftershock; yet the tightness of the ensemble isn't lost and the stylishness of the company performances is undiminished. In Strange Attractors Petronio's interest seems definitively to have shifted from the individual to the stage, and this is elegantly emphasised by Anish Kapoor's magical stage design. Simple but luxurious lighting bathes the space in pinks and blues, while two hanging hemi-spheres of reflective metal not only bounce back the light in glittering points but also reflect diminutive images of the dancers, a whole stage world contained within their polished gaze.</p>",
