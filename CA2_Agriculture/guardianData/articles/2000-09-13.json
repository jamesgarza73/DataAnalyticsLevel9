      "body": "<p>Surrey last night celebrated their second consecutive championship, and the championship's inaugural First Division title, by watching Manchester United play Anderlecht. That seemed appropriate, because comparisons between the brown hats and the Red Devils are increasingly hard to resist. </p> <p>After a long, barren spell of underachievement - 28 years without a title, as opposed to United's 26 - they are now dominating the county game. </p> <p>\"We're a quality squad, no two ways about it,\" said Surrey's manager Keith Medlycott, after they had won the single point needed at the start of play by picking up a third Lancashire wicket shortly after lunch. \"We can pick from 18 or 20 players who can all come into first-class cricket and produce match-winning performances. Over the last few years sides haven't wanted to play us. People are probably fearful.\" </p> <p>Swap first-class cricket for first-team football, and Medders might have been Fergie. </p> <p>But that is where the comparison ends. Medlycott has kept a remarkably low profile despite presiding over a team who, with the Second Division of the National League already wrapped up, have won three trophies in as many years. A knighthood, at this stage, remains some way off. </p> <p>In cricketing tradition Adam Hollioake, the captain, is the public face and voice of this Surrey team. But he had other things on his mind while Medlycott was holding court in the Old Trafford library, typically leading from the front as the opposing skipper, Warren Hegg, rallied Lancashire. </p> <p>They had slipped to 154 for seven - with Neil Fairbrother, Chris Schofield and Glen Chapple all deceived by Saqlain Mushtaq - before Hegg and Gary Keedy put on 107 for the eighth wicket. Surrey were starting to look decidedly ragged, spurning four catches and a stumping, before Hollioake grabbed the ball himself and had Keedy caught at gully in the last over before tea. </p> <p>\"It's not been one of our best performances today,\" admitted Medlycott, putting it down to the inevitable let-down once the title was sealed. \"You could see how much it meant to them by how drained they are.\" </p> <p>Surrey had made the perfect start, with Martin Bicknell trapping Mike Atherton leg-before in his second over. They then received a substantial helping hand from Sourav Ganguly for their second wicket, as India's captain left Mark Chilton stranded by refusing to respond to his call. </p> <p>If poor running is one reason why Ganguly will not be missed at Old Trafford next year, another is his failure to score a championship century. His penultimate attempt ended on 54 when he was brilliantly caught by Hollioake at third slip off Alex Tudor, and that was the wicket which gave Surrey what they came for. It prompted a team huddle which included the 12th man Ben Hollioake - whom Medlycott hopes to keep at the Oval despite suggestions he should move on. </p> <p>Tudor, bowling an excellent spell, had Fairbrother missed twice in the slips from consecutive balls and then sent Graham Lloyd's middle stump cartwheeling. But Hegg kept Lancashire on course to finish second for the third year in a row, helped by Keedy and then Mike Smethurst in a ninth-wicket stand of 54. </p> <p>Hegg was left seven short of his second ton in five days when Peter Martin holed out, but Martin made amends by trapping Mark Butcher lbw in the first over of Surrey's reply. Chapple then pinned Nadeem Shahid and struck the elder Hollioake square in the box. The Surrey captain may have been the first man to accept the championship trophy with a voice an octave higher than it had been at the start of the day.</p>",

After a long, barren spell of underachievement - 28 years without a title, as opposed to United's 26 - they are now dominating the county game. \"We're a quality squad, no two ways about it,\" said Surrey's manager Keith Medlycott, after they had won the single point needed at the start of play by picking up a third Lancashire wicket shortly after lunch. \"We can pick from 18 or 20 players who can all come into first-class cricket and produce match-winning performances. Over the last few years sides haven't wanted to play us. People are probably fearful.\" Swap first-class cricket for first-team football, and Medders might have been Fergie. But that is where the comparison ends. Medlycott has kept a remarkably low profile despite presiding over a team who, with the Second Division of the National League already wrapped up, have won three trophies in as many years. A knighthood, at this stage, remains some way off. In cricketing tradition Adam Hollioake, the captain, is the public face and voice of this Surrey team. But he had other things on his mind while Medlycott was holding court in the Old Trafford library, typically leading from the front as the opposing skipper, Warren Hegg, rallied Lancashire. They had slipped to 154 for seven - with Neil Fairbrother, Chris Schofield and Glen Chapple all deceived by Saqlain Mushtaq - before Hegg and Gary Keedy put on 107 for the eighth wicket. Surrey were starting to look decidedly ragged, spurning four catches and a stumping, before Hollioake grabbed the ball himself and had Keedy caught at gully in the last over before tea. \"It's not been one of our best performances today,\" admitted Medlycott, putting it down to the inevitable let-down once the title was sealed. \"You could see how much it meant to them by how drained they are.\" Surrey had made the perfect start, with Martin Bicknell trapping Mike Atherton leg-before in his second over. They then received a substantial helping hand from Sourav Ganguly for their second wicket, as India's captain left Mark Chilton stranded by refusing to respond to his call. If poor running is one reason why Ganguly will not be missed at Old Trafford next year, another is his failure to score a championship century. His penultimate attempt ended on 54 when he was brilliantly caught by Hollioake at third slip off Alex Tudor, and that was the wicket which gave Surrey what they came for. It prompted a team huddle which included the 12th man Ben Hollioake - whom Medlycott hopes to keep at the Oval despite suggestions he should move on. Tudor, bowling an excellent spell, had Fairbrother missed twice in the slips from consecutive balls and then sent Graham Lloyd's middle stump cartwheeling. But Hegg kept Lancashire on course to finish second for the third year in a row, helped by Keedy and then Mike Smethurst in a ninth-wicket stand of 54. Hegg was left seven short of his second ton in five days when Peter Martin holed out, but Martin made amends by trapping Mark Butcher lbw in the first over of Surrey's reply. Chapple then pinned Nadeem Shahid and struck the elder Hollioake square in the box. The Surrey captain may have been the first man to accept the championship trophy with a voice an octave higher than it had been at the start of the day.",

      "body": "<p>James MacMillan's Parthenogenesis, a piece for actors, singers and instrumentalists, is based on the story of a young woman in Germany in the second world war who apparently gave birth to her own twin. It was supposed that the shock of a bombing raid made her cells spontaneously reproduce, resulting in a fatherless birth: parthenogenesis. </p> <p>Collaborating with librettist/poet Michael Symmons Roberts, and Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Wales (Cambridge's Theology Through the Arts project sponsored it), MacMillan uses the story to investigate the ethical questions surrounding human cloning. </p> <p>Presented as a dark annunciation, Parthenogenesis has Christopher Purves as Bruno, a \"falling angel\", whose intense relationship with Lisa Milne's Kristel culminates in his curse: \"A girl will come to you / She will have no father.\" The progeny of this non-union, Anna, played by actress Anastasia Hille, comments on the complexities of her existence in spoken interludes between each scene, to an electro-acoustic accompaniment of earth-shaking rumbles. </p> <p>The problems begin with the libretto. Just as in his words for MacMillan's song cycle Raising Sparks - performed by the Britten Sinfonia in the first half of their concert - Roberts's text is redolently symbolic. But in the context of a dramatic work, the poetry is leaden and unwieldy. His libretto has only one register - thinly veiled spiritual imagery - so the characters are reduced to a single, static dimension. </p> <p>These difficulties are compounded by MacMillan's music. As in Raising Sparks, he is scrupulously faithful to Roberts's text in finding musical analogies for the libretto's fecund symbolism. In Raising Sparks, the result is an overblown idiom that affects the gestures of high drama - operatic melismas and melodic lines - in response to the imagery, but does not support them with an integrated musical language.

      "bodyText": "James MacMillan's Parthenogenesis, a piece for actors, singers and instrumentalists, is based on the story of a young woman in Germany in the second world war who apparently gave birth to her own twin. It was supposed that the shock of a bombing raid made her cells spontaneously reproduce, resulting in a fatherless birth: parthenogenesis. Collaborating with librettist/poet Michael Symmons Roberts, and Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Wales (Cambridge's Theology Through the Arts project sponsored it), MacMillan uses the story to investigate the ethical questions surrounding human cloning. Presented as a dark annunciation, Parthenogenesis has Christopher Purves as Bruno, a \"falling angel\", whose intense relationship with Lisa Milne's Kristel culminates in his curse: \"A girl will come to you / She will have no father.\" The progeny of this non-union, Anna, played by actress Anastasia Hille, comments on the complexities of her existence in spoken interludes between each scene, to an electro-acoustic accompaniment of earth-shaking rumbles. The problems begin with the libretto. Just as in his words for MacMillan's song cycle Raising Sparks - performed by the Britten Sinfonia in the first half of their concert - Roberts's text is redolently symbolic. But in the context of a dramatic work, the poetry is leaden and unwieldy. His libretto has only one register - thinly veiled spiritual imagery - so the characters are reduced to a single, static dimension. These difficulties are compounded by MacMillan's music. As in Raising Sparks, he is scrupulously faithful to Roberts's text in finding musical analogies for the libretto's fecund symbolism. In Raising Sparks, the result is an overblown idiom that affects the gestures of high drama - operatic melismas and melodic lines - in response to the imagery, but does not support them with an integrated musical language. Similarly, in Parthenogenesis, MacMillan finds effective depictions of musical darkness and light: screeching dissonance and hyperbolic, high-register vocal writing, as opposed to limpid, chorale-like consonance and ingratiating vocal lines. But, having set up these dramatic extremes, he uses them whenever the text seems to demand it, instead of creating a musical structure that can sustain dramatic development. All this makes Parthenogenesis a heavy-handed treatment of the issues surrounding human cloning. Despite committed performances, it lacks a coherent musical, dramatic or intellectual purpose. Parthenogenesis will be broadcast on Radio 3 on September 20.",

In a double piece of good economic news, the office for national statistics announced that unemployment had fallen to a 20-year low while tight pay deals are keeping wage inflation firmly under control. The number of people out of work and claiming benefit last month fell by 18,000 to stand at 1,051,300, while the proportion of the workforce claiming benefit has fallen to 3.6%, its lowest since October 1975. Employment minister Tessa Jowell hailed the figures as adding to the government's \"sustained record of achievement\" while the TUC general secretary John Monks said the figures were \"excellent news\" and showed that full employment was now attainable. The claimant count has fallen by an average of nearly 20,000 a month since June, according to the ONS, raising hopes among Labour strate gists that it will fall below the key 1m level by Christmas. On the government's preferred measure on unemployment, based on the labour force survey, the number of people looking for work has also declined.

It is exactly like one of those delicate Eric Rohmer movies in which little happens on the surface but where by the end a whole set of relationships has been exposed and subtly changed. </p> <p>The title is exactly right: six people gather in the Loire countryside for a family funeral. Three of them are siblings and it becomes clear that there is a dark rivalry between Alex, an agitated literary critic, and the older Nathan who is a Nanterre lawyer. In part it stems from the enigmatic Elisa who was Alex's mistress and now loves Nathan: much of the tension stems from whether Elisa, whose car has broken down, will stay the night and in which bed. Watching helplessly are Edith, sister to the fractious brothers, their ageing uncle and his nervously new wife. </p> <p>Death, said Hazlitt, cancels everything but truth; and part of Reza's point is that it forces antique grudges, failures and longings into the open. Above all, you sense the heavy hand of the dead father on his three unmarried, middle-aged children. The neurasthenic Alex was expected to be a writer but settled for the quieter pastures of criticism. Nathan was the precociously brilliant older brother who lapsed into the law. Even Edith, who has a transient lover, sees herself as \"a dried-up old apple.\" While parents are alive, suggests Reza, we nurse our disappointments: once they are dead our alibis are gone. </p> <p>It may not display Reza's cutting edge. But it is poignant, graceful, wise: one notices the quiet skill with which Reza implies the marriage of the uncle, Pierre, is built on shifting sands. And Christopher Hampton's translation highlights the play's self-consciously literary quality: at one point the marooned Elisa remarks that her enforced return is like something out of a novel and when Pierre refers to Alex's \"rattlesnake compliments\" one is clearly meant to relish the choice phrase. </p> <p>Howard Davies's production, with an autumnal set by Rob Howell, is acted with finesse. The delicious Amanda Root is not my idea of a fading spinster, but Paul Higgins as the Hamletesque Alex and Matthew Marsh as the assured Nathan spar convincingly, Clare Holman is suitably mysterious as Elisa, and it is luxury casting to have David Calder as the Baudelaire-quoting uncle and Claire Bloom radiating stylish insecurity as his wife.

      "body": "<p>Leicester City breathed a sigh of relief yesterday on hearing that the second leg of their Uefa Cup first-round tie against Red Star Belgrade will be played tomorrow fortnight at a neutral venue. </p> <p>European football's governing body originally decided that it must take place in Belgrade on September 21, three days before elections in Yugoslavia, but only on condition that Red Star guaranteed player safety. </p> <p>That assurance failed to materialise by yesterday's deadline so the tie will revert to September 28. Red Star, who visit Filbert Street for the first leg tomorrow, have been given until 3pm on Monday to offer an alternative venue, which must meet Uefa approval. The Bulgarian capital of Sofia has been mentioned. </p> <p>The foreign office has warned British nationals against non-essential travel to Yugoslavia and it is believed the Football Association would have advised Leicester against travelling if Uefa had insisted that the tie go ahead in Belgrade. Last season Leeds were allowed to play a Uefa Cup tie against Partizan Belgrade in the Netherlands. </p> <p>The FA's chief executive David Davies said: \"This is the right decision for Leicester City and for European football. It had become perfectly clear that in no way could a match go ahead in Belgrade over the next fortnight in anything like normal conditions.\" </p> <p>Halifax's Mark Lillis became the second manager to be sacked this season - beating Gianluca Vialli by a matter of hours - after 15 months at the Shay. Lillis, 40, left after Saturday's 5-1 defeat at Mansfield which left Halifax bottom of the Third Division. </p> <p>Newcastle have finally made a bid for Colchester's Lomano Tresor Lua-Lua, the teenage forward watched by several Premiership clubs. Colchester insist they do not want to sell the 19-year-old, who was born in Zaire but raised in London, but will be hard pushed to resist any bid of more than \u00a31m. West Ham claim to have first refusal. </p> <p>Ipswich have agreed terms with Maribor for the Slovenia defender Amir Karic, who played in Euro 2000. The 26-year-old has had a medical and is expected to complete his move next week once a work permit has been granted. </p> <p>However, Everton's hopes of signing the Israel midfielder Idan Tal, 24, have been dashed after he was refused a permit because he failed to meet the criterion of playing 75% of his country's internationals. Everton plan to appeal.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leicester City breathed a sigh of relief yesterday on hearing that the second leg of their Uefa Cup first-round tie against Red Star Belgrade will be played tomorrow fortnight at a neutral venue. European football's governing body originally decided that it must take place in Belgrade on September 21, three days before elections in Yugoslavia, but only on condition that Red Star guaranteed player safety. That assurance failed to materialise by yesterday's deadline so the tie will revert to September 28. Red Star, who visit Filbert Street for the first leg tomorrow, have been given until 3pm on Monday to offer an alternative venue, which must meet Uefa approval. The Bulgarian capital of Sofia has been mentioned. The foreign office has warned British nationals against non-essential travel to Yugoslavia and it is believed the Football Association would have advised Leicester against travelling if Uefa had insisted that the tie go ahead in Belgrade. Last season Leeds were allowed to play a Uefa Cup tie against Partizan Belgrade in the Netherlands. The FA's chief executive David Davies said: \"This is the right decision for Leicester City and for European football. It had become perfectly clear that in no way could a match go ahead in Belgrade over the next fortnight in anything like normal conditions.\" Halifax's Mark Lillis became the second manager to be sacked this season - beating Gianluca Vialli by a matter of hours - after 15 months at the Shay. Lillis, 40, left after Saturday's 5-1 defeat at Mansfield which left Halifax bottom of the Third Division. Newcastle have finally made a bid for Colchester's Lomano Tresor Lua-Lua, the teenage forward watched by several Premiership clubs. Colchester insist they do not want to sell the 19-year-old, who was born in Zaire but raised in London, but will be hard pushed to resist any bid of more than \u00a31m. West Ham claim to have first refusal. Ipswich have agreed terms with Maribor for the Slovenia defender Amir Karic, who played in Euro 2000. The 26-year-old has had a medical and is expected to complete his move next week once a work permit has been granted. However, Everton's hopes of signing the Israel midfielder Idan Tal, 24, have been dashed after he was refused a permit because he failed to meet the criterion of playing 75% of his country's internationals. Everton plan to appeal.",

Following the debacle of John Hartson's attempt to join the club, Mols's squirming, menacing presence is going to be essential in the months ahead. He had returned gingerly to duty against Dundee on Saturday but there was still a communal apprehension about his physical powers here. One exquisite turn and burst of pace which left Markus Schupp floundering in the first half eased that anxiety. It did no harm to Mols's own self-belief when he prodded Rangers ahead in the ninth minute. As the Austrians made a hash of trying to shepherd the ball over their own by-line, Ronald de Boer crept through a side-door past the defenders and poked the ball back to Mols. The Dutchman lashed out a foot to score past a startled Josef Schicklgruber. In an arena in which the usual Ibrox racket seemed to bowl the players along Rangers found it hard not keep pounding at the visitors. Allan Johnston, used sparingly so far by Advocaat this season, had already struck a post before De Boer made it 2-0 after 19 minutes, stealthily advancing to the near post to reach Johnston's cross and flick it past Schicklgruber. Rangers also welcomed back Jorg Albertz, the big German of lumbering gait and thunderous shot, who seems to have the presence of a panzer division on the field. Last night Albertz could afford to be slovenly, missing a penalty after whacking in Rangers' third from 16 yards. Giovanni van Bronckhorst drilled a fourth for Rangers in the 71st minute before Billy Dodds's delightful chip completed the rout five minutes from time Rangers (4-4-2): Klos; Reyna, Konterman, Amoruso, Numan; Johnston, Ferguson, Van Bronckhorst, Albertz; De Boer, Mols. Sturm Graz (3-5-2): Schicklgruber; Mamedov, Foda, Strafner; Schopp, Schupp, Fleurquin, Koros, Prilasnig; Yuran, Reinmayr. Referee: L Cortez (Portugal).",

      "bodyText": "BATM, the Israel-based technology group which has been one of the stock market darlings of the past 12 months, suffered a 7.8% drop in its stock price yesterday despite turning in a 252% increase in half-year profits. The shares were dragged lower by weakness on the technology-laden Nasdaq market in the US - with sentiment also being damaged by the previous day's slump in GEO Interactive, the Tel Aviv-based technology business which has been a favorite among investors in London. At its peak, BATM reached 765p earlier this month - a near-300% increase over the past year. Yesterday the price dropped 60p to 655p, with part of the fall also attributed by analysts to profit-taking. BATM, which makes equipment for telecommunications networks, said pretax profits for the half-year had risen from $2.7m (\u00a31.9m) to $9.4m, partly on the back of its $330m acquisition of Telco Systems of America. Revenues were 237% higher at $36.8m. Dr Zvi Marom, BATM's chief executive, said the Telco deal meant the company's new focus was on developing its business in the US. America was the \"make it or break it\" market for the business. Dr Marom said the company would continue to pursue bolt-on acquisitions in the \"tens of millions of dollars\" price range to drive profitability. The company's share price has benefited from the drip-feed into the market of a series of partnerships with well known businesses. In the past six months it has received orders from Sprint in the US, welcomed Sun Microsystems as an investor and entered into research and development agreements with Sun Microsystems, mobile phone maker Nokia and Samsung. The company is seeking to increase its presence in South Korea, where it has an alliance with Samsung and from where it plans to expand in China. Dr Marom said: \"The amalgamation of Telco Systems with BATM is proceeding even better than we had anticipated, and the relationships we have entered into with our new business partners have been particularly gratifying.

And with everyone happy, Chelsea would surely storm up the league like a recently refuelled truck, and hand Cuddly Ken Bates his first Premiership trophy. Made sense to us.</p> <p>But just as Gianluca Vialli is unlikely to be signing Paolo Di Canio in the near future, we appeared to have misjudged the mood at Stamford Bridge. In fact it was more like a morgue than a mash-up. Just listen to Dennis Wise, who was so depressed he was wearing turned-up jeans and a curious Morrissey-style quiff. \"Everyone was disappointed - Luca was a good friend of mine,\" he wailed. \"We have not started very well. Maybe that is one of the reasons and that is down to us.\" </p> <p>Chief executive Colin Hutchinson joined in the mournathon as he revealed that \"The mood when I arrived was subdued.

But then Ray 'Butch' Wilkins stepped in to set everyone straight. \"That side of Chelsea Football Club is closed and we have to crack on and crack on in big style\", he said manfully.

Certainly not the Fiver, who will resist any attempts to shoehorn us into one of the most demanding jobs in professional football. It won't be Gianfranco Zola either, the overnight favourite for the job having been ruled out after Colin Hutchinson, managing director at Chelsea's of Chelsea said: \"we do not believe that we will take anybody from the current staff despite what some people have been suggesting.\" So who is up for the job? The Fiver profiles the candidates.</p> <p>1/ Terry Venables. The former England coach has been out of management since leaving Crystal Palace. Now the bookies' favourite, but close friends are said to be unsure whether Venables would be interested in a highly-paid position coaching cultured footballers at a glamorous London-based football club. Would not have been available for work if the Fiver's Tel for England campaign hadn't failed so miserably.</p> <p>2/ Arsenal's George Graham. Currently manager of Tottenham Hotspur, this shouldn't stop Graham from spreading the Gooner gospel to another of their deadly local rivals. A stern disciplinarian, his frill-less coaching style should go down well with Frank Leboeuf, Marcel Desailly, Gianfranco Zola, Jes Hog[list curtailed due to reasons of space], and John Harley. Would be able to hook up with old pal Jimbo Hasselbaink though.</p> <p>3/ Aime Jacquet. Basically just dossing around at the French FA, the former national coach could be tempted back into management if the package is right. Obviously close to the French contingent, Jacquet also has the continental approach that appeals to Ken Bates. Reports today have named Jacquet and Didier Deschamps as the new team. A partnership that would please the fans no end.</p> <p>4/ Marcello Lippi. Ideally qualified for the post as he is already coaching Internazionale, the Italian Chelsea (only with less Italians). Like Vialli he's also failed to get into the Champions League, so another duff result or five could see him looking to exchange the hothouse of Milan for the, er hang on, hothouse of London. </p> <p>5/ Craig from out of Big Brother.

And 38% lived in overcrowded homes with more than one person per room.</p> <p>They were almost three times as likely to live in a household without a phone than white, Indian or black Caribbean older people.</p> <p>The report said the ethnic dimension of social inequality among older people could no longer be overlooked. There were nearly 250,000 over-60s from ethnic minority groups, and this number was set to swell as these groups aged.</p> <p>The high point of immigration from the Caribbean was in the early 1960s. Immigration from India and Pakistan peaked in the early 1970s, and from Bangladesh and Hong Kong in the early 1980s.</p> <p>\"The proportion of older people within ethnic minority groups is expected to increase over the next couple of decades, as the first generation migrants from the different minority groups begin to retire,\" said the author of the report, Maria Evandrou of Kings College, London.</p> <p>On an index of multiple deprivation, the survey found 47% of Pakistani and Bangladeshi pensioners experience three or more types of disadvantage, compared to 42% of black Caribbeans, 26% Irish, 19% white and 13% Indian.</p> <p>Two-thirds of white elderly people live in owner-occupied accommodation, usually without mortgage commitments. Indian elders have the highest rates of owner-occupation (88%), but often with an outstanding mortgage.</p> <p>Black Caribbean, Irish and Pakistani and Bangladeshi older people were more likely to live in local authority or housing association accommodation.</p> <p>Black Caribbeans were least likely to live in a household with a car. Nearly two-thirds relied entirely on public transport, affecting ease of shopping and attending hospital.</p> <p>Just over a fifth of white and a quarter of Irish elderly people are in the bottom fifth of the income scale, compared to a third of the older black Caribbeans, half the Indians, and three-fifths of older Pakistani and Bangladeshis.</p> <p>\u0095 Shelter, the housing charity, warned yesterday that homelessness has reached record levels in England. Figures from the Department of the Environment showed the number of households living in temporary accommodation was 66,030 in the secondquarter, a rise of 11% on a year before.</p> <p>\"Households on low incomes are the innocent victims of the housing boom. As rents continue to soar thousands of households are becoming homeless. Our experience shows that temporary accommodation such as bed and breakfast hostels are totally unsuitable for nurturing stable family life,\" said Chris Holmes, the charity's director.</p> <p>Other official figures showed the number of homeless households living in bed and breakfast hostels was 8,380.</p> <p>Shelter said that while house prices were beginning to level out, soaring rents showed no signs of falling, leading to a shortage of affordable housing and homelessness for thousands of low-incomes families.</p> <p>The situation was particularly acute in London where rents have risen 62% since 1993 to an average of \u00a3285 per week for a two-bedroom flat. House prices in the capital now average \u00a3193,000.</p> <p>Shelter called for \"massive investment in decent affordable housing\". About 100,000 affordable homes per year had to be built between 2000 and 2011 to tackle the crisis, it said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Elderly people from the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities in Britain are far more likely to suffer from multiple deprivation than their Indian or white contemporaries, according to a survey of the over-60s published yesterday by the office for national statistics. It found 28% of older Pakistani and Bangladeshis were in households with no central heating that were more likely to suffer from dampness and condensation. And 38% lived in overcrowded homes with more than one person per room. They were almost three times as likely to live in a household without a phone than white, Indian or black Caribbean older people. The report said the ethnic dimension of social inequality among older people could no longer be overlooked. There were nearly 250,000 over-60s from ethnic minority groups, and this number was set to swell as these groups aged. The high point of immigration from the Caribbean was in the early 1960s. Immigration from India and Pakistan peaked in the early 1970s, and from Bangladesh and Hong Kong in the early 1980s. \"The proportion of older people within ethnic minority groups is expected to increase over the next couple of decades, as the first generation migrants from the different minority groups begin to retire,\" said the author of the report, Maria Evandrou of Kings College, London. On an index of multiple deprivation, the survey found 47% of Pakistani and Bangladeshi pensioners experience three or more types of disadvantage, compared to 42% of black Caribbeans, 26% Irish, 19% white and 13% Indian. Two-thirds of white elderly people live in owner-occupied accommodation, usually without mortgage commitments. Indian elders have the highest rates of owner-occupation (88%), but often with an outstanding mortgage. Black Caribbean, Irish and Pakistani and Bangladeshi older people were more likely to live in local authority or housing association accommodation. Black Caribbeans were least likely to live in a household with a car. Nearly two-thirds relied entirely on public transport, affecting ease of shopping and attending hospital. Just over a fifth of white and a quarter of Irish elderly people are in the bottom fifth of the income scale, compared to a third of the older black Caribbeans, half the Indians, and three-fifths of older Pakistani and Bangladeshis. \u0095 Shelter, the housing charity, warned yesterday that homelessness has reached record levels in England. Figures from the Department of the Environment showed the number of households living in temporary accommodation was 66,030 in the secondquarter, a rise of 11% on a year before. \"Households on low incomes are the innocent victims of the housing boom. As rents continue to soar thousands of households are becoming homeless. Our experience shows that temporary accommodation such as bed and breakfast hostels are totally unsuitable for nurturing stable family life,\" said Chris Holmes, the charity's director. Other official figures showed the number of homeless households living in bed and breakfast hostels was 8,380. Shelter said that while house prices were beginning to level out, soaring rents showed no signs of falling, leading to a shortage of affordable housing and homelessness for thousands of low-incomes families. The situation was particularly acute in London where rents have risen 62% since 1993 to an average of \u00a3285 per week for a two-bedroom flat. House prices in the capital now average \u00a3193,000. Shelter called for \"massive investment in decent affordable housing\". About 100,000 affordable homes per year had to be built between 2000 and 2011 to tackle the crisis, it said.",

It took six months to sign up the first supplier, but then momentum built up and eCountries now has about 400 service providers in its database, which covers four areas: legal translation and market research; recruitment; property services and insurance; and financial services.

The dual keys to success will be the thoroughness of its vetting process to keep out less-than-reputable companies and of course, whether people use the service. </p> <p>It could be cheaper and easier to conduct searches on the net and call up a few local companies, though there is no guaranteed safety net like with eCountries. If companies want their hand held as they strike out into new markets, eCountries could be their guide.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.eCountries.com/\">eCountries</a></p>",

With cross-border trade growing, eCountries believes there is plenty of scope for its venture as companies seek out reliable lawyers, accountants and other professionals in the countries in which they are doing business. Building up a database of service providers from accountancy firms to law firms was tough at first. It took six months to sign up the first supplier, but then momentum built up and eCountries now has about 400 service providers in its database, which covers four areas: legal translation and market research; recruitment; property services and insurance; and financial services. When a client posts a request on the site, it will get, at the very least, a global and a regional player in the specified sector. Great care is taken to vet the companies for marketplace. Of the 400 Russian companies suggested for eCountries's marketplace, only 50 survived the cull. In the most important part of the vetting process, a candidate who wishes to be included has to provide references from three companies with which it has done business. Clients \"are entering a walled garden for vetted suppliers,\" said Smith, who sold a broadcast monitoring business to Pearson in 1995 for \u00a34m and then went on to run the company's FT.com subsidiary. Schmidt, meanwhile, founded Asia Intelligence Wire and ran the Asian division of the Financial Times. eCountries expects to break even by 2002. Investors like the look of the top team, which includes Michael Elliott, the editor-in-chief, who jumped ship as international editor of Newsweek to get involved. He had no qualms about joining the new venture. \"I'd become more and more thrilled by the possibilities of the net,\" he said, \"Especially by its ability to be a global distribution mechanism for international news and information and I thought, 'If I don't make the leap into something new now, I never will.' I'm having a blast.\" eCountries has undoubtedly hit upon a good idea. The dual keys to success will be the thoroughness of its vetting process to keep out less-than-reputable companies and of course, whether people use the service. It could be cheaper and easier to conduct searches on the net and call up a few local companies, though there is no guaranteed safety net like with eCountries. If companies want their hand held as they strike out into new markets, eCountries could be their guide. Useful links eCountries",

Some midwives were fantastic and very accommodating to me and others ignored me. My wife spent four exhausted nights on a ward after a caesarean birth and couldn't even lift our baby.

When I arrived at the hospital for the birth, I was stressed out but I understood that all attention had to be on Clare. These days we have to work harder to make relationships last and being there for the birth is a key factor. \u0095 Verdict: No Tom Beardshaw Father of Cole, three months There is no real provision for dealing with fathers. Some midwives were fantastic and very accommodating to me and others ignored me. My wife spent four exhausted nights on a ward after a caesarean birth and couldn't even lift our baby. I was with her during the days, but between 8pm and 10am I was kicked out. Every morning my wife and child were very distressed. It was so frustrating because they wouldn't accept my help, so I had to sit around at home. Because fathers have only recently become involved in pregnancy and birth, no one has been trained to deal with them. \u0095 Verdict: Yes",

For the better? Not necessarily. </p> <p>Some changes are well-publicised: the rise in assisted conception; the advances in genetic screening; the extension of immunisation programmes against childhood diseases - and the fears of what additional problems the vaccines might bring; the latest findings in cot death research; and what Madonna thinks of British maternity hospitals. </p> <p>The fact that child-bearing and raising make front page news is in itself different from when I started out. Then, having children was a much more low-key, less self-conscious affair. </p> <p>I had my first two children in the 80s - the so-called style decade. That was me in the John Galliano jacket, with the Conran shop armchairs and the Dualit toaster. But my babies were not privy to such excesses. </p> <p>When I was expecting my first child I headed straight for the second-hand children's gear shops of west London where I was delighted to find a rather worn brown corduroy carrycot. It was wonderfully multifunctional: it sat on wonky wheels (as a pram), on a wooden stand (as a cot) and strapped in the back seat of the car (as a car seat). And it only set me back \u00a310. Why would I spend more on something that would be needed for such a short time? </p> <p>Since then the baby gear industry has gone into overdrive. The choice is vast and ever-changing. Just to take a newborn for a walk you are faced with a plethora of options: two-in-one or three-in-one \"travel systems\", front-facing or rear-facing, traditional pram, all-terrain pushchair. And you are still probably going to want a removable car seat, a Baby Bjorn carrier, and maybe a sling as well. And you'll probably stop using most of that within the first year - a period, according to Prima magazine, when the average parents spend \u00a34,500 on their baby. </p> <p>Everything costs a packet - a Land Rover all-terrain buggy for example is around \u00a3385 - and comes in a bewildering choice of \"designer\" patterns and colourways, as you might expect if you were purchasing a top-of-the-range BMW. As for second-hand, whether it's because of the scare over a connection between \"used\" mattresses and cot death, or simply that parents are gaining status from the fashionableness of their baby equipment, it does not seem nearly so common. </p> <p>That doesn't mean I'm not happy to join in this time around. As a baby-proud new mother, I was delighted to discover Tim Waterstone's newest enterprise, Daisy and Tom, an easy-pram-access shop on King's Road in Chelsea selling great clothes, good books, educational toys, an edited selection of prams and strollers, and even a kiddie haircutting business. In my day, Mothercare was almost top of the range. </p> <p>But the huge increase in things to buy - from sterilising units to magazines to the glories of Baby Gap - is only part of the change. There is a different mindset now. From the very point of conception, parents of the 21st century expect to be in control more than I ever did. A large number of women know the gender of the baby they are carrying. They write plans for the kind of birth they want and follow books that outline the rate at which their child should be developing. Yes, there were childcare manuals in 1986, but not many, and you felt rather foolish resorting to them. Now it is a market worth around \u00a36m a year in this country. </p> <p>The starkest current example of the quest for control is the runaway success of The Contented Little Baby Book by Gina Ford, a maternity nurse. If you follow its schedules - which start off with an hour-by-hour regime for a two-week-old baby - you will be able to set your watch by your newborn, and sleep through the night by at least four months. I suspect its popularity may be partially a result of modern parents witnessing the ghastliness of kids born to their libertarian predecessors, but it is spookily like the four-hourly feeds and leave 'em to cry disciplinarian tactics that my mother remembers guiltily from the 50s. </p> <p>Information is key for the contemporary parent. Everything has a name and every problem has a solution; they daren't sit back or wait and see. Having absorbed the antenatal classes, books, TV programmes, magazines and newspapers, first-time mothers reach the labour ward knowing almost as much as their consultants about the most arcane bits of obstetrics. </p> <p>The perfectly normal struggle to get a baby to sleep at night is now called \"sleep training\" for which there are a number of regimes to try. A London housewife called Annabel Karmel has become a baby food guru by writing books about what is basically mashing up fruit and vegetables. There's very little sense of doing what comes naturally - of having any kind of instinctive feeling for what might suit your particular child. </p> <p>The plethora of research into child development has thrown up fascinating stuff - I never knew small babies were drawn to black and white images for example - but has also created new terrors that are treated with deadly seriousness. When, for example, a new mattress was delivered this week, the cot death warning boldly stated: \"Do not let your baby get too hot (or too cold).\" </p> <p>Back in the 80s I blithely placed my babies on their tummies to sleep; routinely fed them delicious sloppy scrambled egg, and peanut butter sandwiches. While pregnant I drank coffee, wine, gin, whatever, and ate liver, unpasteurized cheese and seafood. I gave up breast feeding after a couple of months. I had never even heard of separation anxiety - and my older children seem fairly normal. Nowadays all of that is verboten , mostly because some report or other has shown them to be \"bad for baby\". </p> <p> But, for all that feeling of proscription and orthodoxy, I have welcomed some changes in modern motherhood with open arms. Seeing celebs like Catherine Zeta-Jones, Madonna and Patsy Kensit with pregnant bellies stylishly bedecked did make me feel less drab when pregnant. Women are no longer routinely weighed at their antenatal class appointments. Antenatal yoga classes are a wonderful invention. Epidurals are readily available and much more acceptable among all types of women, even the staunch NCT-types. From the hospital to the local health centre, there is much more information and help on offer (even if half of it freaks you out). Fathers are generally more involved, and welcomed. </p> <p>There is also one area in which progress has really changed the life of a new mother, and that is nappy technology. I am not talking about the change from cotton nappies to disposable - that did happen between my mother's childbearing years and my own - but the change from barely adequate disposable to miraculously absorbent, totally reliable disposal. And the best thing of all: some frighteningly efficient gel hidden within the depths of these lightweight new inventions means that there is simply no nappy rash anymore.

      "body": "<p>Mention step-families to anyone and they've got a story. A story like the one from my friend John, who was seven when he went to live with his mum and her new man. He hated the man, who told him to take all the toys out of the living room and keep them in his bedroom. His mum laughed with the man now, when she used to laugh with the child. Eventually the guy couldn't cope with the hostile child, so a year later John went to live with his auntie. </p> <p>Or another story from a woman I barely know, who told me about her 16-year-old daughter's crush on a 17-year-old boy. He's her new stepbrother, sleeping every other weekend in the room next door to hers. </p> <p>By the year 2010 there will be more step-families than birth families in the UK. Already 650 children see their parents go through a separation every day, and 40% of remarriages involve live-in stepchildren. Altogether, the number of children in step-families has more than tripled from three-quarters of a million in 1991 to 2.5m today. </p> <p>Blending two families, with their own allegiances, habits, in-jokes, shared trust and history, is not easy and it takes time. You may think it easier when one of the parents is childless, but no. \"Step-parents often compare themselves with immigrants who have been plunked down in a strange country to face an unfamiliar language and culture,\" says Genevieve Clapp, a family and divorce mediator. They frequently feel guilty because they don't instantly love their stepchildren, yet at the same time hurt when these children are unresponsive to their attempts at bonding. </p> <p>Then along comes a baby of their own, and the equation is all changed again - with lots of potential for jealousy, guilt and resentment besides. Affection bonds, say Clapp, are \"generally never as strong between a stepparent and stepchildren as they are between a biological parent and child\". </p> <p>Step-families have their work cut out: experts recommend them to move slowly, limiting or staggering change. The older the children are, the more resistant they usually are to a new family and the longer the adjustment period. Expectations often create difficulties: the last thing a step-family needs is pressure to reconstitute as a \"proper family\", adding more frustration, disappointment and guilt to an already emotionally fragile situation. </p> <p>But expectations abound, and what the research shows is that step-families are getting a raw deal. Researchers from the Institute of Psychiatry in London and the University of Bristol followed the lives of 10,000 women aged between 16 and 40 who had a baby in 1991. They found that four in 10 of the couples who had their first child together, but also lived with children from previous relationships, were not together 21 months after the birth - compared with only 5% of families where everyone was related to each other. Other figures show that 40% of remarriages end in divorce within four years. </p> <p>The support group Parentline Plus reports that four out of five calls concern step-families, and the majority of fathers lose touch with their children after the mother's remarriage. Children from step-families are likely to leave home earlier, at around 16 or 17, a recent Scottish survey revealed. With stepfathers outnumbering step mothers seven to one, the most common problem is discipline, with the men relying on an archetypal masculine role within the family. </p> <p>And this does not work. As Maureen Freely says in her book The Parent Trap: \"For a man who associates dominance with masculinity, the constraints of step-parenthood are likely to be problematic...

Bruno Bettelheim, a psychoanalyst, suggests the usefulness of the wicked stepmother myth in fairy tales is that it can help young children separate the good, kind mother from the scary, cross mother until a later stage when they are emotionally able to integrate these conflicting aspects and emotions. </p> <p>But the world has changed and it is all too easy for children to become stunted in their development by imposing the good-bad mother model on to their birth and stepmother; scapegoating the stepmother in an attempt to protect their feelings about the birth mother. (Interestingly stepmother families are the most likely to fail.) For the children involved, the cost of a parent's remarriage may be high. They may have to move home and school; share their bedroom with a stranger; give up the status of older sibling. Children suffer anxiety and loss. The parent's time, attention and love must now be shared, so the step-parent is usually an unwelcome intruder.

      "bodyText": "Mention step-families to anyone and they've got a story. A story like the one from my friend John, who was seven when he went to live with his mum and her new man. He hated the man, who told him to take all the toys out of the living room and keep them in his bedroom. His mum laughed with the man now, when she used to laugh with the child. Eventually the guy couldn't cope with the hostile child, so a year later John went to live with his auntie. Or another story from a woman I barely know, who told me about her 16-year-old daughter's crush on a 17-year-old boy. He's her new stepbrother, sleeping every other weekend in the room next door to hers. By the year 2010 there will be more step-families than birth families in the UK. Already 650 children see their parents go through a separation every day, and 40% of remarriages involve live-in stepchildren. Altogether, the number of children in step-families has more than tripled from three-quarters of a million in 1991 to 2.5m today. Blending two families, with their own allegiances, habits, in-jokes, shared trust and history, is not easy and it takes time. You may think it easier when one of the parents is childless, but no. \"Step-parents often compare themselves with immigrants who have been plunked down in a strange country to face an unfamiliar language and culture,\" says Genevieve Clapp, a family and divorce mediator. They frequently feel guilty because they don't instantly love their stepchildren, yet at the same time hurt when these children are unresponsive to their attempts at bonding. Then along comes a baby of their own, and the equation is all changed again - with lots of potential for jealousy, guilt and resentment besides. Affection bonds, say Clapp, are \"generally never as strong between a stepparent and stepchildren as they are between a biological parent and child\". Step-families have their work cut out: experts recommend them to move slowly, limiting or staggering change. The older the children are, the more resistant they usually are to a new family and the longer the adjustment period. Expectations often create difficulties: the last thing a step-family needs is pressure to reconstitute as a \"proper family\", adding more frustration, disappointment and guilt to an already emotionally fragile situation. But expectations abound, and what the research shows is that step-families are getting a raw deal. Researchers from the Institute of Psychiatry in London and the University of Bristol followed the lives of 10,000 women aged between 16 and 40 who had a baby in 1991. They found that four in 10 of the couples who had their first child together, but also lived with children from previous relationships, were not together 21 months after the birth - compared with only 5% of families where everyone was related to each other. Other figures show that 40% of remarriages end in divorce within four years.

      "body": "<p>It is widely accepted that the welfare settlement after the second world war was based on the assumption that there would be stable families and full-time work for men. Given the increased insecurity and flexibility of the labour market, the growth in women's employment and the rapid pace of family change in the late 20th century - divorce up threefold and the proportion of children born outside marriage up fourfold in one generation - it is no wonder that the principles underpinning the welfare state are in question. </p> <p>The old welfare model assumed that men would be breadwinners and women would take responsibility for the care of young and old in the family. While the model never wholly accorded with reality, it acted as a powerful prescriptive model reflected in public and private law. </p> <p>At the beginning of the 21st century, government's assumptions have changed dramatically. The drive of \"welfare-to-work\", begun by the Conservatives and developed by Labour, assumes an \"adult worker model family\". All adults who are capable will be in the labour market. But how far does the model fit social reality? And what about unpaid care work? </p> <p>The old male breadwinner model has certainly eroded. According to the general household survey, 81% of men and 62% of women aged 16-64 were economically active in 1975. By 1996, this figure was 70% for both sexes. Married women are just as likely to be employed as non-married women. In contrast, men's labour market participation has fallen; indeed the contribution by men to family income fell more than 10 percentage points between 1979-81 and 1989-91. </p> <p>However, the vast majority of the post-1945 increase in married women's employment is accounted for by part-time employment in the service of the welfare state (much of it low paid); 44% of women workers were part-time in 1998 and almost a quarter work \"short part-time\" - under 20 hours a week. So while families supported by a single male breadwinner are now undoubtedly in a minority, the division of paid work in dual earner households takes a variety of forms. Dual career couples are in fact relatively rare. The norm in Britain, as in many European countries, has become the more or less one-and-a-half-earner household. </p> <p>Government has been stressing the obligation to engage in paid work. But there is also an obligation to care and these two things must be balanced. The Labour government has not neglected the issue of care work. The national child care strategy is a first for a country that has consistently occupied a place near the bottom of the European child care league. The child care tax credit embodied in the working families tax credit scheme is also an important initiative in a country where the issue of reconciling work and family responsibilities has been historically ignored. Further, there is the new strategy for carers and proposals for second pension credits for those caring for young children or adults. </p> <p>However, all these positive initiatives are relatively small alongside the major programmes to get people into employment: the New Deal and the working families tax credit. There is no coherent policy on the care of dependants, young and old, to match the policy on paid work. </p> <p>The problems of moving towards a full adult worker model are fourfold. Unpaid care work is unequally shared between men and women, which has substantial implications for women's position in the labour market. Given the lack of good quality affordable care in the formal sector (public and private), many women have little option but to continue to provide it. A significant number of female carers want to feel that it is \"right\" to prioritise care over paid work. Women's low pay, especially in care-related jobs, means that full individualisation is hard to achieve, on the basis of long part-time or even full-time work. </p> <p>Just as policy assumptions based on a male breadwinner model disadvantaged women in particular, so assumptions based on an adult worker model are likely to do so. This does not mean that policy should swing back to a more traditional family model. Given the likelihood that all adults will have to rely more on self-provision in future, not least in respect of pensions, it is important that as many adults as possible are able to earn. However, it is important that government pays attention to the context for the promotion of a new adult worker model. Without access to affordable, good quality support for care, women in particular may resist the injunction to enter the labour market on more than a short part-time basis. Or they will enter and risk adverse effects on dependants. </p> <p>There are two examples of a long-standing adult worker model. In the US, the obligation to enter the labour market is embedded in a residual welfare system that often borders on the punitive. The US has extremely high rates of child poverty and high rates of juvenile imprisonment. Sweden and Denmark also operate an adult worker model, supported by an extensive range of care entitlements in respect of children and older people. Child poverty rates are the lowest in OECD countries and juvenile crime rates low. </p> <p> These contrasting experiences show there are policy choices. Taking care work seriously should be a priority and we need to share unpaid work between men and women more fairly. Policies that would promote the sharing of care include: paid parental leave, with a portion set aside for use by men (the so-called \"daddy month\" in the Scandinavian countries; a right to a shorter working day (as in Scandinavia) or a shorter working week (as in the Netherlands) for parents with small children; and greater provision of good quality child care and elder care. </p> <p>On the care side, jobs need to attract a living wage and certainly pay no less than working the checkout at Tesco; and the social security system needs to take account of people's lifetime labour market experience, particularly in respect of pension guarantees, so that carers do not suffer further consequences of low-paid work and periods with no pay. </p> <p>It is difficult to work full time and care for dependants. Something has to give. Policy-makers are concerned about the family and about parenting. They are concerned about work. It is strange that they are so little preoccupied with policies on care.</p> <p>\u0095 Jane Lewis is Barnett professor of social policy at Oxford University.

      "body": "<p>A short stroll down one stretch of the tidal reach of the Thames last Wednesday was illuminating. On the north foreshore, below the Royal Hospital in Chelsea, an eclectic group of people were gathered. Here, feet in the rising waters, keenly debating the need for land reform and the problems of the global and local environment, were the Queen's Asian chaplain, the bishop of Southwark, a Buddhist monk, a businessman, a journalist (myself), an artist, a Brazilian human rights worker, a baroness, a general and landowner, an MEP, a refugee, and the head of Amnesty International. </p> <p>With ducks looking on and the tide rushing in, the gathering of these 12 \"archetypal\" characters - under the auspices of the String of Pearls festival - was billed as the \"people's\" riposte to the UN social summit in New York. It was, most participants agreed, bizarre, symbolic and uplifting. </p> <p>The same day, a few miles downstream at Westminster, the Dome and its Thames-side were the centre of another furious political row, the doomed attraction having asked for - and been given- another \u00a347m to keep going. The government claimed the project was now about regenerating the local riverside community. </p> <p>At least one member of the Thames Waterside Regeneration project said the Dome had brought no discernible benefits for local employment or disadvantaged people, although Jenny Bates, of Friends of the Earth in Greenwich, disagreed, having seen marginal local returns of more than \u00a3750m. </p> <p>But the most optimistic view of the Thames that day came a mile downstream from Westminster, at Coin Street, the great and only central London community success story of the past 30 years. There, preparations were being made for this Sunday's Thames festival, the annual burgeoning celebration of the river and the communities who depend on it, love it or just happen to live by it. Christophe, the undisputed king pyro-artiste, following his millennium firework display on the Eiffel Tower, was in deep discussion with festival organiser Adrian Evans about how to light up the river and the city from 30 barges. </p> <p>Evans, in turn, was explaining that thousands of people, helped by artists and people from more than 78 community projects, would be walking in procession by lantern light in wild, river-related fancy costumes over Blackfriars bridge and down the embankment. </p> <p>Evans was upbeat. \"Most Londoners have a place for the Thames in their heart,\" he said. \"The river is becoming common ground. It now links London, rather than divides it. There is more respect for it by developers. It's as if we are revaluing the Thames for its 'riverness'. You can walk virtually the length.\" The Tate Modern, the London Eye, the millennium village at the Dome, the pagoda, the wibbly-wobbly bridge, and a bunch of new riverside developments allow access and have attracted people back. </p> <p>Much of this new awareness of the river as a resource for the metropolis and a source of pride, Evans and others believe, has been inspired by the great clean-up of the river. Human diversity has been found to improve when the ecology prospers. When the Thames was dead, Londoners turned away from it. Now that it is biologically alive people are flocking back like the birds. You can spot anglers, sailors, eel fishers, school parties and bishops nowadays on the river almost as easily as waders and ducks. </p> <p>It is a major reversal. Only 40 years ago a report to the Natural History Museum stated that there were no resident fish populations between Kew and Gravesend. Investment in sewage treatment cleaned up the water. Fish and wildlife began to reappear in the 1960s and the invertebrates in the 1970s. The small mammals still haven't made it, but there are 114 species of fish. </p> <p>But the river, like the Thames festival and the new cultural awareness of the river, is desperately fragile, say both the Environment Agency and Evans. The history of the Thames is for developments to extend further into the river foreshore, so further destroying its ecology. There are still few habitats along the tidal Thames. Only 1% of the tidal river now has a natural river bank and less than a third of its length has sloping, artificial banks. The rest is wall, limiting access, and increasing the river flow. </p> <p>Equally, the history of the Thames shows that human creativity has been snuffed out. Witness the depressing new housing developments along the river beyond Tower Bridge, uniformly elitist, mostly inaccessible, unwelcoming enclaves for people with several cars and huge mortgages. </p> <p>Yet improving the river, socially and ecologically, is a priority for many. The Thames has more interested par ties, watchdogs and \"owners\" than almost any other stretch of Britain. But, as river lovers point out, many institutions, councils, companies and others who want to promote access and sensitive development, are relatively powerless. </p> <p>An anonymous, undated article on the web sums up the situation. It is clearly written by someone who loves the river and knows its politics. The river, it says, is for sale. The Environment Agency, it accurately surmises, is under-staffed and under-funded, and only has power to advise. However much it may seek the agreement of developers to respect the the ecology of the river, it has weak legal status and only marginal influence on decision-makers. Many developers and councils are impervious to local opinion, have no environmental concerns, and \"pay lip-service to envi ronmental assessment, if at all\". Land owners such as Thames Water, British Gas and Railtrack, it accurately points out, still bear no statutory responsibility for ecological or social good practice. The Port of London Authority is not a statutory consultee in the planning process and as such does not see all river plans and cannot legally influence them. </p> <p>Equally, English Heritage has no remit to protect the Thames, and English Nature has very limited powers that relate only to statutory protected species. They have no overall powers regarding the cumulative impact of piecemeal development. </p> <p>Meanwhile, says Jenny Bates, of Friends of the Earth, the powerful London business community is trying to build three river crossings which would increase the traffic and intensify development in down stream riverside boroughs. \"Business argues that the river is a barrier and that London must work in a 360-degree circle,\" she says. \"They should, surely, be trying to meet local needs.\" </p> <p>So what would improve the situation? The anonymous author wants statutory protection of the Thames as a green corridor and a wildlife super-highway, and a change of planning emphasis away from the presumption to build. Educating planning officers, MPs and decision-makers is vital and there should be better cycle routes and more shore access. </p> <p>It will do for now. In the meantime, the Thames festival may have to wait a while before it can fully celebrate the return of the river to Londoners. </p> <p>\u0095 The Thames festival at the Oxo tower starts at midday on Sunday.

At least one member of the Thames Waterside Regeneration project said the Dome had brought no discernible benefits for local employment or disadvantaged people, although Jenny Bates, of Friends of the Earth in Greenwich, disagreed, having seen marginal local returns of more than \u00a3750m. But the most optimistic view of the Thames that day came a mile downstream from Westminster, at Coin Street, the great and only central London community success story of the past 30 years. There, preparations were being made for this Sunday's Thames festival, the annual burgeoning celebration of the river and the communities who depend on it, love it or just happen to live by it. Christophe, the undisputed king pyro-artiste, following his millennium firework display on the Eiffel Tower, was in deep discussion with festival organiser Adrian Evans about how to light up the river and the city from 30 barges. Evans, in turn, was explaining that thousands of people, helped by artists and people from more than 78 community projects, would be walking in procession by lantern light in wild, river-related fancy costumes over Blackfriars bridge and down the embankment. Evans was upbeat. \"Most Londoners have a place for the Thames in their heart,\" he said. \"The river is becoming common ground. It now links London, rather than divides it. There is more respect for it by developers. It's as if we are revaluing the Thames for its 'riverness'. You can walk virtually the length.\" The Tate Modern, the London Eye, the millennium village at the Dome, the pagoda, the wibbly-wobbly bridge, and a bunch of new riverside developments allow access and have attracted people back. Much of this new awareness of the river as a resource for the metropolis and a source of pride, Evans and others believe, has been inspired by the great clean-up of the river. Human diversity has been found to improve when the ecology prospers. When the Thames was dead, Londoners turned away from it. Now that it is biologically alive people are flocking back like the birds. You can spot anglers, sailors, eel fishers, school parties and bishops nowadays on the river almost as easily as waders and ducks. It is a major reversal. Only 40 years ago a report to the Natural History Museum stated that there were no resident fish populations between Kew and Gravesend. Investment in sewage treatment cleaned up the water. Fish and wildlife began to reappear in the 1960s and the invertebrates in the 1970s. The small mammals still haven't made it, but there are 114 species of fish. But the river, like the Thames festival and the new cultural awareness of the river, is desperately fragile, say both the Environment Agency and Evans. The history of the Thames is for developments to extend further into the river foreshore, so further destroying its ecology. There are still few habitats along the tidal Thames. Only 1% of the tidal river now has a natural river bank and less than a third of its length has sloping, artificial banks. The rest is wall, limiting access, and increasing the river flow. Equally, the history of the Thames shows that human creativity has been snuffed out. Witness the depressing new housing developments along the river beyond Tower Bridge, uniformly elitist, mostly inaccessible, unwelcoming enclaves for people with several cars and huge mortgages. Yet improving the river, socially and ecologically, is a priority for many. The Thames has more interested par ties, watchdogs and \"owners\" than almost any other stretch of Britain. But, as river lovers point out, many institutions, councils, companies and others who want to promote access and sensitive development, are relatively powerless. An anonymous, undated article on the web sums up the situation. It is clearly written by someone who loves the river and knows its politics. The river, it says, is for sale. The Environment Agency, it accurately surmises, is under-staffed and under-funded, and only has power to advise. However much it may seek the agreement of developers to respect the the ecology of the river, it has weak legal status and only marginal influence on decision-makers. Many developers and councils are impervious to local opinion, have no environmental concerns, and \"pay lip-service to envi ronmental assessment, if at all\". Land owners such as Thames Water, British Gas and Railtrack, it accurately points out, still bear no statutory responsibility for ecological or social good practice. The Port of London Authority is not a statutory consultee in the planning process and as such does not see all river plans and cannot legally influence them. Equally, English Heritage has no remit to protect the Thames, and English Nature has very limited powers that relate only to statutory protected species. They have no overall powers regarding the cumulative impact of piecemeal development. Meanwhile, says Jenny Bates, of Friends of the Earth, the powerful London business community is trying to build three river crossings which would increase the traffic and intensify development in down stream riverside boroughs. \"Business argues that the river is a barrier and that London must work in a 360-degree circle,\" she says. \"They should, surely, be trying to meet local needs.\" So what would improve the situation? The anonymous author wants statutory protection of the Thames as a green corridor and a wildlife super-highway, and a change of planning emphasis away from the presumption to build. Educating planning officers, MPs and decision-makers is vital and there should be better cycle routes and more shore access. It will do for now. In the meantime, the Thames festival may have to wait a while before it can fully celebrate the return of the river to Londoners. \u0095 The Thames festival at the Oxo tower starts at midday on Sunday.

En route it has netted \u00a3900,000 of lottery funding, \u00a3250,000 from the Home Office's active community unit, and \u00a3130,000 from the Department for International Development. Sky Digital is providing free air-time of up to 12 hours a day for three years - a commitment worth \u00a31.8m - but lean finances mean that the channel is taking up only three hours a day. </p> <p>Gerry Melling, its managing director and a former editor of GMTV, the breakfast station, says: \"No sane person would try to put a channel up and on the air for under about \u00a35m really.

It's got to survive by having interesting filming.\" No one would watch a channel that kept actively asking for something, he acknowledges. </p> <p>Programmes, usually 20 minutes long, will comprise about half charity films and half studio output, and may be repeated seven times - which sounds a lot, but will make the channel one of the least repeated on Sky Digital, according to Melling. More than 70 charities so far are booked to appear. The format is designed to appeal to people who are involved in, or contribute to, charities. They are expected to be female and, marginally, ABC1. Initially the channel will be only on Sky Digital but there are plans to extend it to other digital channels; it will be webcast -broadcast on the net - 24 hours a day, and in about 18 months should be on interactive television. </p> <p>Charities will be watching the Community Channel carefully. John Gray, director of communications at the British Red Cross, says that as digital TV only goes to a small number of people at present, the channel will need to be heavily publicised. \"It's early days - the initiative is very good and the concept is fascinating but I think my worry is how many years before we are really going to get it off the ground in terms of viewers being there to know about it and also to use it from time to time.\" </p> <p>The Red Cross's programme, promoting goods and volunteering, will be shown (and repeated) before Christmas and the charity will study the response in terms of viewing figures, which it initially expects to be small - possibly 10,000. \"I think they need to monitor the concept of the channel as it stands, to see if it's really taking off and working, and I hope it will,\" says Gray. </p> <p>Joe Korner, communications manager of the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB), says that his key issue is whom the audience will be. \"I think at the moment their thinking is that it's the voluntary sector,\" he says. \"The challenge for charities such as the RNIB is to get out beyond the people who already know about us to the general public.\" </p> <p>How the channel will be funded in future has yet to be resolved. \"We will ensure that commercial interests don't take over the channel and we will fight to the end to make this a charity-only channel that is run on a not for profit basis,\" says Melling. The channel is applying for more government funding and consultancy KPMG is doing models for future financing. One possibility, says Diehl, is to charge bigger charities for airtime (which is now free) or bring in corporate sponsors. Another is to take a cut of the price of goods bought. \"We've gone down the tele-shopping route, partly as a wheeze to show the charities' own films, but also because we know that charity trading is the one area of charities that's growing at the moment,\" she says. \"We think that the concept of a charity shop, an electronic charity shop - television and web - is an exciting one. The shopping channels are doing pretty well in the digital world.\" </p> <p>Diehl rates the channel's survival chances after three years as pretty high. \"We are the first in there and that's always useful.

Shelley Poticha, its executive director, says numerous programmes designed to revive cities have failed because they have sought a \"magic bullet\" in the form of massive public investment. While this attracted some private investment, it failed to \"employ the jobless, house middle-class families, or revive schools\". Gratz says that the best neighbourhood have not been torn down and rebuilt. Rather, they incorporate new flats and businesses, in old factories and warehouses, instead of big, publicly-funded projects. To be successful, she argues, regeneration schemes must be community-led and not imposed from the top by government. \"The role of the government must be as nurturer not initiator and funder,\" she warns. But city government certainly does have a role. Town halls in the US attract private developers with long, tax-free periods and a range of other incentives. In turn, businesses join cities in funding street improvements, light rail systems - in the case of Portland, Oregon - and new river walks and reborn city centres, such as Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It couldn't happen in England - yet. But Gratz is optimistic. She says: \"The thing that strikes me most about your cities is that you have not totally bulldozed your downtown areas the way we did. There is a lot going for you.\" \u0095 Peter Hetherington is the Guardian's regional affairs correspondent",

      "body": "<p>When Joyce Headley came to Birmingham from Jamaica with her parents and sisters in the early 60s, she dreamed of the snow and of becoming a nurse. She never imagined she'd end up in prison. </p> <p>But here she is working in one of Britain's most troubled prisons, the notorious HMP Brixton in south London, which has witnessed nine suicides and gone through three governors in the last four years. </p> <p>Headley's job, part of a scheme set up by the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders four years ago, is to help inmates find an alternative means to a life of crime after their release - the key ingredients to which are employment and housing. </p> <p>She became interested in community work via a playscheme for disadvantaged children where she worked as a volunteer in her 20s. \"I lived in a very deprived part of north London, in Stoke Newington, and so I saw what happened to people who had nothing - they turned to wrong-doing,\" says Brixton's lone rehabilitator. (Her planned nursing career ended after three years, and she confesses: \"I couldn't bear being around sickness and laying people out. It was an environment where I had no control or influence.\") </p> <p>After becoming a teacher's helper, Headley went to teacher training college (deferred after she decided her children needed her at home more) and then joined another ex-offender charity before landing a post in a \"jobclub\" at Pentonville prison, north London. </p> <p>Now aged \"50-ish\", she spends five days a week in Brixton, talking to men about their futures. \"I can help because I'm not judgmental,\" says Headley, whose own family struggled to make ends meet on arrival in Britain. \"You can't just write people off as bad because they've broken the law, especially if you are in a position to make a difference. Anyway, it's in everyone's interest to try to reduce repeat offending. I always tell the employers I invite into Brixton for seminars: 'It could be your mum or a member of your family who is burgled or attacked next.' Everyone deserves a chance at a job.\" </p> <p>Around 40 to 50 inmates visit Headley each week. \"I emphasise to the men they must always try to be rational and positive, and not behave like a victim,\" says Headley. This comes from her own experience bringing up a family in a white-dominated society. When she found her children bleaching their faces to be whiter, she told them they could be whatever they wanted to be if they wanted it enough. Still, she knows it's hard for inmates to retain a positive attitude to life on the outside when there is so much discrimination against them. Without a job to go to, she knows some 65% are likely to re-offend. </p> <p>Ken Hawley, a governor at Brixton with responsibility for inmate activities, says of Headley's work: \"It's about making the prison accessible to those who can help and advise inmates. Joyce is a great organiser, persuasive, and approachable. That, combined with her in-depth knowledge and understanding of inmates' problems, means she is really superb for this role.\" </p> <p>Most of the inmates Headley sees are from disadvantaged backgrounds - many with inevitable literacy and drug problems. \"They're at the bottom of the pile, with no way out,\" she says. \"And with no job, they revert to underhand dealings. </p> <p>\"I want to break down the barrier of employer prejudice, which is largely fear. By getting employers such as Iceland and Kwik-Fit into the custodial setting, I try to break down the myths about ex-offenders. When they see a prisoner in an education class, they often see someone who really is trying to do the best with what they've got instead of someone who is just bad.\" </p> <p>Headley has found jobs locally for several inmates with Iceland, which has pledged to expand the practice to employing ex-offenders nationally, and Kwik-Fit has also expressed interest. She says: \"There's nothing more satisfying than bumping into an inmate on the outside, which I often do, and finding they are working, or have set up a small business.\" </p> <p>She helps inmates to find accommodation, sorts out welfare benefits and gets those in financial difficulty on to debt management pro grammes. She listens to their emotional and domestic problems, and is the only civilian ever to win the prison's \"employee of the month\" award of its 500 staff, 200 of whom are officers. </p> <p>One inmate who acts informally as a \"buddy\" to other prisoners says: \"Men can have a confrontational attitude to other men, whereas they are kinder and gentler to a woman. Joyce is gold. Having her comforting presence and care is so important in a hostile environment like this, it's like water in a desert.\" </p> <p>\"When I walk around, there's such a high black population here I think: 'God, why are you all here? Wouldn't you rather be somewhere else?' None of them did it, of course - they were all fitted up - but quite a few of them do want to change their lives, and with the right help and support they could actually do it. Sadly, there isn't usually a budget for this work in prisons.\" </p> <p>The government has just announced funding for careers and housing advice for seven prisons, including Pentonville, to be run along similar lines to Brixton's Nacro project. </p> <p>Jobs can't get much tougher than persuading employers to take on men who've been in prison. Headley attributes her success to her parents, but not in a totally positive way. She says: \"They were terribly Victorian and strict, but they were in a strange country and were unquestioning of those in authority, such as doctors and teachers, in a way that only immigrants are.

      "body": "<p>Christine Barton can't write. She has a PhD, is an equal opportunities consultant, a trustee of various charities, and received an MBE in the recent birthday honours list, but she can't write. </p> <p>Christine is my partner. It's not that she doesn't know how to write. She knows how to write rather well; words are part of what she does. But she has multiple sclerosis and there are a lot of physical things she can't do. Not being able to hold a pen might seem trivial in comparison with not being able to stand, walk or feed yourself, but the consequences are far-reaching. </p> <p>Strictly, it's not writing that's the problem; with a personal computer and the latest voice recognition software, Christine can put words on screen almost as fast as she can think. The problem - and it's a big one - centres on that untidy, personal and often illegible squiggle which we all take for granted: our signature. Without the means to identify ourselves, we don't exist. And Christine can't sign her name. </p> <p>Because multiple sclerosis is a progressive condition, what begins as a minor inconvenience can rapidly become a major problem. As writing became more difficult, I started signing her cheques. Holding a pen at the very top produced a good approximation of her shaky signature, and no one ever queried it. Yes, I know it's illegal, but it's the best we could think of at the time. </p> <p>At first, I think we both accepted that further limitation of Christine's independence was inevitable. By now, she couldn't sign cheques, use her credit or Switch card, sign a passport or an insurance application, and I didn't even want to think about what might happen if we ever wanted to sell the house. </p> <p>Early solutions tended to accept the limitations. Christine arranged for a credit card to be issued in the name of her personal assistant. This solved the immediate problem of shopping, but wasn't a lot of use when she was out with friends or her daughter. A joint bank account was suggested, but Christine has always steadfastly resisted this - something to do with my belief that, if God had wanted us to keep our accounts in credit, he wouldn't have created overdrafts. However, I did become an authorised signatory on her account. </p> <p>People made helpful suggestions. Could Christine hold a pen in her mouth? Could a pen be put between her fingers and someone else move her hand? </p> <p>All were well intentioned, but the reality was that Christine's capacity to make her own decisions, to control her own life, was being progressively eroded. She was being penalised for not being able to write her name. But who is at fault - Christine, or a system which insists that she must? </p> <p>Attempting to open a new building society account was the catalyst: \"Certainly, madam, but we need a signature - someone will need to take power of attorney.\" </p> <p>Power of attorney involves handing over responsibility to someone else. Christine was not prepared to allow this. It would reduce her independence still further and reinforces the tacit link in the public mind between physical impairment and mental incapacity. It's the \"does she take sugar?\" syndrome, and it's unacceptable. Physical impairment need not and should not equal dependency. But it frequently does and that's why the system needs challenging. Christine started with the building society. It took a number of phone calls and some intensive consultation between the local branch and head office, but she now has her Nationwide Isa. The forms were filled in by the branch manager without signature and she can withdraw money from the local branch at any time, again without signature. The Inland Revenue was quite sniffy about the arrangement, claiming that there had to be a signature for the account to qualify for tax exemption, but Nationwide managed to overcome these objections. </p> <p>Next, the bank. Christine had been in protracted negotiations with Barclays because, being unable to sign, she could not use either her Barclaycard or Switch card in shops. Initially, they were unable to come up with any solution, so it was time to try a different tack. </p> <p>Christine is a trustee of Voluntary Action Sheffield. Its legal adviser suggested she try a number of routes, one of which eventually led to the British Bankers' Association in London - and this turned out to be the key. Joanna Elson, a director of the association, wrote to Christine enclosing a leaflet advising banks and customers what can be done when customers find it difficult to sign. This leaflet contained the crucial statement: \"English law recognises as a valid signature not only one written manually by the signatory, but also one appropriately embossed using a facsimile signature stamp.\" </p> <p>Christine now has a facsimile stamp. This was easily obtained by taking a copy of an old signature to a legal stationer who produced the stamp. Barclays supplied new Switch and Barclaycards which were embossed with the stamp (slight prob lem: on the cards, the ink from the stamp took three days to dry). A copy of the signature has also been scanned into her computer so that she can use this on letters. </p> <p>Now, when Christine goes shopping, she pays. Whoever accompanies her will use the stamp on her behalf, but she is in control. No retailer has ever questioned this method of payment. In fact, the reaction of most has been: \"What a good idea!\" </p> <p>There has been one challenge, almost inevitably from the legal profession. Christine was until recently a trustee of Age Concern Sheffield and, in this capacity, agreed to sign a lease for office accommodation. The solicitors handling the transaction initially refused to accept the facsimile, suggesting that the advice from the British Bankers' Association counted only as custom and practice and was not in fact law. Back to the association and Elson was able to supply the necessary references and precedents. Lease stamped! </p> <p>Christine is angered and frustrated by the barriers which society creates. \"You stop being a real person with the same rights as everyone else,\" she says. \"The more impaired you become the less rights you seem to have and this is not how it should be.\" </p> <p>But there's always another battle. Christine's passport needs renewing. The Passport Agency will accept a facsimile stamp on passport applications, but only with a covering statement from the applicant's GP. Do the rest of us need a statement from our GPs? No? Oh dear, here we go again.</p> <p><strong>Right impression </strong></p> <p>Nobody knows how many people cannot sign their name, or have problems doing so, but it is likely to number many thousands. As well as people with degenerative illnesses, there are those with severe physical and learning disabilities who may never have had a signature. </p> <p>The British Bankers' Association leaflet, which prompted Christine Barton to find a solution in the form of her own \"rubber stamp\" (pictured left), says some banks will provide templates to help position a signature on a cheque book or credit card, or will issue cards with a photograph of the user.</p> <p>The leaflet, available from the association on 020-7216 8800 or at www.bba.org.uk, offers tips for people who have difficulty producing a consistent signature: a weighted cuff may help curb a tremor; a thick or felt pen makes writing easier. An occupational therapist may advise further.</p> <p>\u0095 The British Bankers' Association can be contacted at Pinners Hall, 105-108 Old Broad Street, London EC2N 1EX</p>",

      "bodyText": "Christine Barton can't write. She has a PhD, is an equal opportunities consultant, a trustee of various charities, and received an MBE in the recent birthday honours list, but she can't write. Christine is my partner. It's not that she doesn't know how to write. She knows how to write rather well; words are part of what she does. But she has multiple sclerosis and there are a lot of physical things she can't do. Not being able to hold a pen might seem trivial in comparison with not being able to stand, walk or feed yourself, but the consequences are far-reaching. Strictly, it's not writing that's the problem; with a personal computer and the latest voice recognition software, Christine can put words on screen almost as fast as she can think. The problem - and it's a big one - centres on that untidy, personal and often illegible squiggle which we all take for granted: our signature. Without the means to identify ourselves, we don't exist. And Christine can't sign her name. Because multiple sclerosis is a progressive condition, what begins as a minor inconvenience can rapidly become a major problem. As writing became more difficult, I started signing her cheques. Holding a pen at the very top produced a good approximation of her shaky signature, and no one ever queried it. Yes, I know it's illegal, but it's the best we could think of at the time. At first, I think we both accepted that further limitation of Christine's independence was inevitable. By now, she couldn't sign cheques, use her credit or Switch card, sign a passport or an insurance application, and I didn't even want to think about what might happen if we ever wanted to sell the house. Early solutions tended to accept the limitations. Christine arranged for a credit card to be issued in the name of her personal assistant. This solved the immediate problem of shopping, but wasn't a lot of use when she was out with friends or her daughter. A joint bank account was suggested, but Christine has always steadfastly resisted this - something to do with my belief that, if God had wanted us to keep our accounts in credit, he wouldn't have created overdrafts. However, I did become an authorised signatory on her account. People made helpful suggestions. Could Christine hold a pen in her mouth? Could a pen be put between her fingers and someone else move her hand? All were well intentioned, but the reality was that Christine's capacity to make her own decisions, to control her own life, was being progressively eroded. She was being penalised for not being able to write her name. But who is at fault - Christine, or a system which insists that she must? Attempting to open a new building society account was the catalyst: \"Certainly, madam, but we need a signature - someone will need to take power of attorney.\" Power of attorney involves handing over responsibility to someone else. Christine was not prepared to allow this. It would reduce her independence still further and reinforces the tacit link in the public mind between physical impairment and mental incapacity. It's the \"does she take sugar?\" syndrome, and it's unacceptable. Physical impairment need not and should not equal dependency. But it frequently does and that's why the system needs challenging. Christine started with the building society. It took a number of phone calls and some intensive consultation between the local branch and head office, but she now has her Nationwide Isa. The forms were filled in by the branch manager without signature and she can withdraw money from the local branch at any time, again without signature. The Inland Revenue was quite sniffy about the arrangement, claiming that there had to be a signature for the account to qualify for tax exemption, but Nationwide managed to overcome these objections. Next, the bank. Christine had been in protracted negotiations with Barclays because, being unable to sign, she could not use either her Barclaycard or Switch card in shops. Initially, they were unable to come up with any solution, so it was time to try a different tack. Christine is a trustee of Voluntary Action Sheffield. Its legal adviser suggested she try a number of routes, one of which eventually led to the British Bankers' Association in London - and this turned out to be the key. Joanna Elson, a director of the association, wrote to Christine enclosing a leaflet advising banks and customers what can be done when customers find it difficult to sign. This leaflet contained the crucial statement: \"English law recognises as a valid signature not only one written manually by the signatory, but also one appropriately embossed using a facsimile signature stamp.\" Christine now has a facsimile stamp. This was easily obtained by taking a copy of an old signature to a legal stationer who produced the stamp. Barclays supplied new Switch and Barclaycards which were embossed with the stamp (slight prob lem: on the cards, the ink from the stamp took three days to dry). A copy of the signature has also been scanned into her computer so that she can use this on letters. Now, when Christine goes shopping, she pays. Whoever accompanies her will use the stamp on her behalf, but she is in control. No retailer has ever questioned this method of payment. In fact, the reaction of most has been: \"What a good idea!\" There has been one challenge, almost inevitably from the legal profession. Christine was until recently a trustee of Age Concern Sheffield and, in this capacity, agreed to sign a lease for office accommodation. The solicitors handling the transaction initially refused to accept the facsimile, suggesting that the advice from the British Bankers' Association counted only as custom and practice and was not in fact law. Back to the association and Elson was able to supply the necessary references and precedents. Lease stamped! Christine is angered and frustrated by the barriers which society creates. \"You stop being a real person with the same rights as everyone else,\" she says. \"The more impaired you become the less rights you seem to have and this is not how it should be.\" But there's always another battle. Christine's passport needs renewing. The Passport Agency will accept a facsimile stamp on passport applications, but only with a covering statement from the applicant's GP. Do the rest of us need a statement from our GPs? No? Oh dear, here we go again. Right impression Nobody knows how many people cannot sign their name, or have problems doing so, but it is likely to number many thousands. As well as people with degenerative illnesses, there are those with severe physical and learning disabilities who may never have had a signature. The British Bankers' Association leaflet, which prompted Christine Barton to find a solution in the form of her own \"rubber stamp\" (pictured left), says some banks will provide templates to help position a signature on a cheque book or credit card, or will issue cards with a photograph of the user. The leaflet, available from the association on 020-7216 8800 or at www.bba.org.uk, offers tips for people who have difficulty producing a consistent signature: a weighted cuff may help curb a tremor; a thick or felt pen makes writing easier. An occupational therapist may advise further. \u0095 The British Bankers' Association can be contacted at Pinners Hall, 105-108 Old Broad Street, London EC2N 1EX",

He would like to see the wood encourage other churches to create their own wildlife havens. Canon Robert Brunswick, rector of St Michael and All Angels, says the church council wanted to create something of lasting value for the local community. \"The land was grazed before, but the farmer retired last year so we felt it was the opportune moment to use the land in a different way.\"",

      "body": "<p>Peter Salmon says he has \"no regrets\" about his time as controller of BBC1. Speaking exclusively to Mediatheguardian.com this morning, Salmon acknowledged his three years in the job had been a \"rollercoaster ride\". But, he added, \"I've loved it and I'm going to take up my next job with the same relish\".</p> <p>He spoke about his highs and lows in the job and his ambitions for BBC sport. Here are his thoughts on ITV, on the leaking of his departure and the future of the channel he leaves.</p> <p><strong>On leaving BBC1:</strong> <br> I've been plotting a change for some months. As my predecessors will tell you, it's always tricky to work out what you do next because BBC1's such a momentous challenge. Ultimately I thought, I'm passionate about sport, I'm sure I'm going to learn a lot and I hope they are going to benefit from my experience. I'm thrilled.</p> <p><strong>On leaving just as BBC1 receives the \u00a3100m cash injection he argued for:</strong> <br> I'm relieved for BBC1 that Greg Dyke so quickly took up the challenge and delivered [the extra cash]. That will change everything. The new foundations for BBC1 are all there and the next incumbent gets to design the new building. You don't do this job for life, you're a caretaker. You've then got to have the strategy and the instinct to move on. </p> <p><strong>On the speculation over his future:</strong> <br> [The announcement] was precipitated a bit, but this has been in the pipeline for a while. It was the Edinburgh TV Festival: all that booze and too many dinners and drinks, it was just full of speculation. His highs and lows: I'm very proud of the schedule week in week out. I'm so lucky to have had so many brilliant colleagues, I can't tell you. I've had a lot of support and I've earned it by backing creative people. I've had real creative highs [such as] watching Walking with Dinosaurs soar. It didn't get placed after the EastEnders trial that Monday by accident. And to see Warriors gobble up so much money when we didn't have much to spend then become one of the best dramas of the last five years, in my opinion. But you have to take the brickbats as well as the bouquets. I've loved it and I'm going to take up my next job with the same relish. You can't do the big jobs without sticking your neck out, without gambling. </p> <p><strong>Peter Salmon's highs and lows:</strong> <br> <strong>Highs:</strong> Dinosaurs, Warriors, Royle Family, Clocking Off. <br> <strong>Lows:</strong> Vanessa Feltz's contract rows, the effect of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? on the BBC1 schedule. It's a marathon running these channels. In the race we're in a pretty good position. It's cyclical. ITV is having a bad autumn but they'll bounce back. David Liddiment is a canny leader. I'm so pleased to be leaving this autumn because it's brilliant. </p> <p><strong>His ambitions for BBC Sport:</strong> <br> I want the BBC to be a major player, a major creative force in sport and put the emphasis on creativity. We've a lot to learn from the Dinosaurs in terms of looking at the emerging technology. Innovation is very important to us. Digital developments such as the BBC's interactive Open Golf and Wimbledon coverage are the beginning of an interesting creative journey. Clearly we've got to build some new relationships with rights holders. I can't reveal what our priorities are. </p> <p><strong> Any regrets?</strong> <br> No. None. I'm glad to be doing something this big and this meaty.</p>",

But, he added, \"I've loved it and I'm going to take up my next job with the same relish\". He spoke about his highs and lows in the job and his ambitions for BBC sport. Here are his thoughts on ITV, on the leaking of his departure and the future of the channel he leaves. On leaving BBC1: I've been plotting a change for some months. As my predecessors will tell you, it's always tricky to work out what you do next because BBC1's such a momentous challenge. Ultimately I thought, I'm passionate about sport, I'm sure I'm going to learn a lot and I hope they are going to benefit from my experience. I'm thrilled. On leaving just as BBC1 receives the \u00a3100m cash injection he argued for: I'm relieved for BBC1 that Greg Dyke so quickly took up the challenge and delivered [the extra cash]. That will change everything. The new foundations for BBC1 are all there and the next incumbent gets to design the new building. You don't do this job for life, you're a caretaker. You've then got to have the strategy and the instinct to move on. On the speculation over his future: [The announcement] was precipitated a bit, but this has been in the pipeline for a while. It was the Edinburgh TV Festival: all that booze and too many dinners and drinks, it was just full of speculation. His highs and lows: I'm very proud of the schedule week in week out. I'm so lucky to have had so many brilliant colleagues, I can't tell you. I've had a lot of support and I've earned it by backing creative people. I've had real creative highs [such as] watching Walking with Dinosaurs soar. It didn't get placed after the EastEnders trial that Monday by accident. And to see Warriors gobble up so much money when we didn't have much to spend then become one of the best dramas of the last five years, in my opinion. But you have to take the brickbats as well as the bouquets. I've loved it and I'm going to take up my next job with the same relish. You can't do the big jobs without sticking your neck out, without gambling. Peter Salmon's highs and lows: Highs: Dinosaurs, Warriors, Royle Family, Clocking Off. Lows: Vanessa Feltz's contract rows, the effect of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? on the BBC1 schedule. It's a marathon running these channels. In the race we're in a pretty good position. It's cyclical. ITV is having a bad autumn but they'll bounce back. David Liddiment is a canny leader. I'm so pleased to be leaving this autumn because it's brilliant. His ambitions for BBC Sport: I want the BBC to be a major player, a major creative force in sport and put the emphasis on creativity. We've a lot to learn from the Dinosaurs in terms of looking at the emerging technology. Innovation is very important to us. Digital developments such as the BBC's interactive Open Golf and Wimbledon coverage are the beginning of an interesting creative journey. Clearly we've got to build some new relationships with rights holders. I can't reveal what our priorities are. Any regrets? No. None. I'm glad to be doing something this big and this meaty.",

Engineers are chasing each other down the hallways, firing soft-tipped darts from Nerf guns. Their programmer colleagues are busy playing table football, or hunched over video-games. And when real work begins, it is as likely to take the form of a \"bug bash\" - where programmers stay in the office long into the night until they have fixed a certain number of glitches in the system - as it is a conventional meeting. </p> <p>Or, at least, this is what the male ones are doing. These are scenes from Valley of the Boys, a documentary by Monika Khushf, director of engineering at the software company Intuit, which alarmed many by demonstrating just how male-dominated Silicon Valley's working culture really is. Khushf, interviewing male and female engineers from major technology companies including <a href=\"http://www.sun\" target=\"_NEW\">Sun Microsystems</a>, <a href=\"http://www.apple.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Apple Computers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.netscape.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Netscape</a>, portrayed a workplace where men spend long hours - weekends included - constructing elaborate model cities in Lego while their female colleagues look on, depressed or simply resigned. \"They're having a great old time,\" one woman told Khushf. \"And I'm sitting there going, 'Oh, please!'\" </p> <p>These women would not be surprised by a new list of the most influential people in the valley compiled by the San Jose Mercury, its leading newspaper. Not one woman made the top 10. And in Britain, we're no better - our three biggest internet companies, <a href=\"http://freeserve.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Freeserve</a>, the auction site <a href=\"http://www.qxl.com\" target=\"_NEW\">QXL </a>and the software firm <a href=\"http://www.autonomy.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Autonomy</a>, have one woman director between them. In any sector this would be a cause for concern - but in the supposedly revolutionary crucible of e-business, where casually attired workers pride themselves on abandoning the hang-ups of the old economy, it is little short of a disaster. </p> <p>It's not as if there aren't any women entrepreneurs to begin with: according to the National Foundation of Women Business Owners, the number of women-owned businesses in the US has more than doubled in the past decade. Indeed, American women seem positively fuel-injected when it comes to start-ups: they are launching businesses at twice the rate of their male counterparts. </p> <p>But it is becoming increasingly clear that the old boys' network that has been consigned to history is being replaced by a new one, focused on the venture capitalists who provide the speculative backing for the valley's big ideas. </p> <p>Insiders like to portray the new economy as running on little but caffeine and ideas, but of course, deep down, it runs on cash - and here, a new boys' network is vigorously asserting itself. According to Venture One, an organisation that provides information to venture capitalists, only 5% of the total venture capital funding in the States goes to companies with women chief executives. Of the 3,000 venture capitalists currently working in the US, only 90 are women, says Diana Reid, of the San Francisco-based Forum for Women Entrepreneurs. You do the math, as they say in San Jose. </p> <p>Reid and others are starting to mobilise the valley's women, in a movement that includes Women in Technology International - which holds an annual Silicon Valley summit in Santa Clara - and a range of \"incubators\", such as the San Francisco-based Women's Technology Cluster, which aims specifically to nurture technology start-ups run by women. Not that you will ever get anyone in the politics-free valley to admit to being an activist. \"We don't consider ourselves to be an affirmative-action group,\" says Reid. \"We're just trying to jump-start excellent business plans.\" </p> <p>In Britain, the situation is even worse when it comes to venture- capital funding. Lucy Marcus, who set up <a href=\"http://www.HighTech-Women.com\" target=\"_NEW\">HighTech-Women.com</a> to support women in technology-related fields by mentoring and networking, says there are a pitiful number of women venture capitalists working in London. \"I can name them without running out of fingers,\" she says. </p> <p>Launched in March this year, High Tech-Women already boasts 700 members. Recent months have also witnessed the launch of Busygirl.co.uk, the first business technology portal dedicated to women internet entrepreneurs, and Webgrrls.org.uk, another networking organisation. </p> <p>\"In the UK, getting VC finance is made more difficult because the VCs in town have always been traditional city boys of the old-school network,\" says May Chong of Webgrrls. \"They are men who have very little experience of doing business with women - let alone women who are younger and more 'techy' than them.\" </p> <p>The best-known American exception to all this is Carly Fiorina, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and the first woman to head one of America's 20 largest companies as measured by revenues. Recently named by Fortune magazine as the most powerful woman in business, she sees the gender divide as part of a wider problem of conformity - exactly the personality trait that most valley entrepreneurs expend energy trying to deny. </p> <p>\"Diversity needs to become a priority in the hi-tech industry,\" Fiorina says. \"Right now there is a virtual wall between available talent and available jobs: diversity is not a hiring practice nor a hiring priority in many Silicon Valley companies.\" This, combined with the \"less-than-open perspective of many hiring managers\" means, says Fiorina, that \"this industry has far too much conformity\". </p> <p>Strenuous attempts are being made to change things. The American Computer Experience, for example, offers free places to girls on its computer camps (predictably, computer summer camps are dominated by boys: only 10-15% of campers are girls). Other educational projects seek to educate the educators: surveys show that girls are put off computing by dull programming classes dominated by nerdy boys nursing violent videogames and an inability to communicate in anything other than computer programming languages. </p> <p>Wendy Tan is one of the lucky British women to be shown the money. At 29, she is the founder and chief executive of Moonfruit, a service provider specialising in website-building tools. \"In my career, it's so normal being the only woman that you don't notice it any more,\" she says. Of the 40 businesses in the investment portfolio of their major backer, the investment-fund firm Europ@web, Tan says she is the only female boss. </p> <p>Ultimately, the valley's unstoppable appetite for talent may force change. Says Carolyn Leightton, founder and chair of Women in Technology International: \"As the demand for talented technologists grows, and the supplies continue to shrink, those companies which are committed to removing the barriers for the advancement of women will certainly be the winners.\" Although it may be drowned out by the sound of the table-football games and the Nerf-gun shootouts, a quiet revolution may soon become an economic necessity.</p>",

It's not as if there aren't any women entrepreneurs to begin with: according to the National Foundation of Women Business Owners, the number of women-owned businesses in the US has more than doubled in the past decade. Indeed, American women seem positively fuel-injected when it comes to start-ups: they are launching businesses at twice the rate of their male counterparts. But it is becoming increasingly clear that the old boys' network that has been consigned to history is being replaced by a new one, focused on the venture capitalists who provide the speculative backing for the valley's big ideas. Insiders like to portray the new economy as running on little but caffeine and ideas, but of course, deep down, it runs on cash - and here, a new boys' network is vigorously asserting itself. According to Venture One, an organisation that provides information to venture capitalists, only 5% of the total venture capital funding in the States goes to companies with women chief executives. Of the 3,000 venture capitalists currently working in the US, only 90 are women, says Diana Reid, of the San Francisco-based Forum for Women Entrepreneurs. You do the math, as they say in San Jose. Reid and others are starting to mobilise the valley's women, in a movement that includes Women in Technology International - which holds an annual Silicon Valley summit in Santa Clara - and a range of \"incubators\", such as the San Francisco-based Women's Technology Cluster, which aims specifically to nurture technology start-ups run by women. Not that you will ever get anyone in the politics-free valley to admit to being an activist. \"We don't consider ourselves to be an affirmative-action group,\" says Reid. \"We're just trying to jump-start excellent business plans.\" In Britain, the situation is even worse when it comes to venture- capital funding. Lucy Marcus, who set up HighTech-Women.com to support women in technology-related fields by mentoring and networking, says there are a pitiful number of women venture capitalists working in London. \"I can name them without running out of fingers,\" she says. Launched in March this year, High Tech-Women already boasts 700 members. Recent months have also witnessed the launch of Busygirl.co.uk, the first business technology portal dedicated to women internet entrepreneurs, and Webgrrls.org.uk, another networking organisation. \"In the UK, getting VC finance is made more difficult because the VCs in town have always been traditional city boys of the old-school network,\" says May Chong of Webgrrls. \"They are men who have very little experience of doing business with women - let alone women who are younger and more 'techy' than them.\" The best-known American exception to all this is Carly Fiorina, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and the first woman to head one of America's 20 largest companies as measured by revenues. Recently named by Fortune magazine as the most powerful woman in business, she sees the gender divide as part of a wider problem of conformity - exactly the personality trait that most valley entrepreneurs expend energy trying to deny. \"Diversity needs to become a priority in the hi-tech industry,\" Fiorina says. \"Right now there is a virtual wall between available talent and available jobs: diversity is not a hiring practice nor a hiring priority in many Silicon Valley companies.\" This, combined with the \"less-than-open perspective of many hiring managers\" means, says Fiorina, that \"this industry has far too much conformity\". Strenuous attempts are being made to change things. The American Computer Experience, for example, offers free places to girls on its computer camps (predictably, computer summer camps are dominated by boys: only 10-15% of campers are girls). Other educational projects seek to educate the educators: surveys show that girls are put off computing by dull programming classes dominated by nerdy boys nursing violent videogames and an inability to communicate in anything other than computer programming languages. Wendy Tan is one of the lucky British women to be shown the money. At 29, she is the founder and chief executive of Moonfruit, a service provider specialising in website-building tools. \"In my career, it's so normal being the only woman that you don't notice it any more,\" she says. Of the 40 businesses in the investment portfolio of their major backer, the investment-fund firm Europ@web, Tan says she is the only female boss. Ultimately, the valley's unstoppable appetite for talent may force change. Says Carolyn Leightton, founder and chair of Women in Technology International: \"As the demand for talented technologists grows, and the supplies continue to shrink, those companies which are committed to removing the barriers for the advancement of women will certainly be the winners.\" Although it may be drowned out by the sound of the table-football games and the Nerf-gun shootouts, a quiet revolution may soon become an economic necessity.",

      "byline": "Colin Ford",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Jack Simmons, who has died aged 85, was emeritus professor of history at Leicester University and our finest railway historian.</p> <p>His authoratitive book, The Railways Of Britain: An Historical Introduction (1961), provided a clarion call for research, and a plea for an understanding of the role of railways in 19th and 20th century history. His original, dramatic and approachable work, St Pancras Station (1968), places the station, its railway and the men who built it - from magnates to navvies - at the centre of a spider's web that reached into every corner of Victorian life. \"For me,\" he said, 'St Pancras station is a building that exercises the force of life itself.\"</p> <p>By then, Simmons had established the transport history collection at Leicester University library, donating 200 objects of his own. The collection has since grown by tens of thousands of items, and become an immensely important research tool. He published Transport Museums In Britain And Western Europe (1970), and encouraged his fellow trustees on the Science Museum advisory committee to establish the National Railway Museum in York - in the teeth of opposition from those who thought all such national assets should be London.</p> <p>Simmons was born in Isleworth, Middlesex, and, after his father was killed in the first world war, his mother brought him up as an only child; he lived with her until she died in 1971. He went to Westminster school in 1928, and to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1933, gaining a modern history degree in 1937. After a year in Paris, he returned to Oxford and, having been found unfit for wartime military service, became Beit lecturer in the history of the British Empire in 1943.</p> <p>In 1947, aged 33, he was appointed as the first professor of history at what was then University College, Leicester, with just 200 students. Simmons's role in the growth of what became Leicester University can scarcely be exaggerated: he was, at various times, acting vice-chancellor, pro vice-chancellor, public orator and an energetic member of countless boards and committees. The year after university status was granted, he described it all in New University (1957), a rather dry account that betrays little of the strains of his own role. He should perhaps have become a vice-chancellor, but was held back by ill-health and a determination not to be deflected from his historical interests.</p> <p>Simmons was responsible for starting Leicester's highly regarded course for training museum professionals, and was a longtime chairman of its university press. He lectured and published on the empire and commonwealth, on Victorian Britain, on travel, the countryside, and his beloved Devon.</p> <p>His first book, African Discovery (1942), was edited with Margery Perham. His second, published in 1945, was an excellent life of Robert Southey, poet laureate to George III and IV. Sadly, his proposed study of Wordsworth never appeared.</p> <p>It had been in 1947, at his inaugural professorial lecture, that Simmons first drew attention to the lack of study of Victorian railways. Twenty-eight years later, the National Railway Museum opened and, from 1981 to 1984, he chaired its advisory committee - the museum's reading room was renamed in his honour.</p> <p>Simmons also served on the advisory committee of the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, which was opened in Bradord in 1983, and both museums published short, but excellent, catalogues by him: Dandy Cart To Diesel (1981) and Image Of The Train (1985 and 1993). The last words of the latter express the hope that his readers, and visitors to the exhibition \"may see here that there is more to the railway than they had supposed before, more to be noticed, and more to be enjoyed\".</p> <p>Jack Simmons helped many people to notice and enjoy not only railways but also landscape and architecture, language and literature, and food and wine. He took an interest in everything around him, and being interested meant making himself knowledgeable. Being knowledgeable meant sharing that knowledge.</p> <p>His last publication was the magisterial, but accessible, Oxford Companion To British Transport History (1997), edited with Gordon Biddle. Its articles add up to a comprehensive story of the rise and fall of British railways. In 1999, Simmons was awarded an OBE. He deserved more.</p> <p>\u0095 Jack Simmons, historian, born August 30 1915; died Septmber 3 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jack Simmons, who has died aged 85, was emeritus professor of history at Leicester University and our finest railway historian. His authoratitive book, The Railways Of Britain: An Historical Introduction (1961), provided a clarion call for research, and a plea for an understanding of the role of railways in 19th and 20th century history. His original, dramatic and approachable work, St Pancras Station (1968), places the station, its railway and the men who built it - from magnates to navvies - at the centre of a spider's web that reached into every corner of Victorian life. \"For me,\" he said, 'St Pancras station is a building that exercises the force of life itself.\" By then, Simmons had established the transport history collection at Leicester University library, donating 200 objects of his own. The collection has since grown by tens of thousands of items, and become an immensely important research tool. He published Transport Museums In Britain And Western Europe (1970), and encouraged his fellow trustees on the Science Museum advisory committee to establish the National Railway Museum in York - in the teeth of opposition from those who thought all such national assets should be London. Simmons was born in Isleworth, Middlesex, and, after his father was killed in the first world war, his mother brought him up as an only child; he lived with her until she died in 1971. He went to Westminster school in 1928, and to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1933, gaining a modern history degree in 1937. After a year in Paris, he returned to Oxford and, having been found unfit for wartime military service, became Beit lecturer in the history of the British Empire in 1943. In 1947, aged 33, he was appointed as the first professor of history at what was then University College, Leicester, with just 200 students. Simmons's role in the growth of what became Leicester University can scarcely be exaggerated: he was, at various times, acting vice-chancellor, pro vice-chancellor, public orator and an energetic member of countless boards and committees. The year after university status was granted, he described it all in New University (1957), a rather dry account that betrays little of the strains of his own role. He should perhaps have become a vice-chancellor, but was held back by ill-health and a determination not to be deflected from his historical interests. Simmons was responsible for starting Leicester's highly regarded course for training museum professionals, and was a longtime chairman of its university press. He lectured and published on the empire and commonwealth, on Victorian Britain, on travel, the countryside, and his beloved Devon. His first book, African Discovery (1942), was edited with Margery Perham. His second, published in 1945, was an excellent life of Robert Southey, poet laureate to George III and IV. Sadly, his proposed study of Wordsworth never appeared. It had been in 1947, at his inaugural professorial lecture, that Simmons first drew attention to the lack of study of Victorian railways. Twenty-eight years later, the National Railway Museum opened and, from 1981 to 1984, he chaired its advisory committee - the museum's reading room was renamed in his honour. Simmons also served on the advisory committee of the National Museum of Photography, Film and Television, which was opened in Bradord in 1983, and both museums published short, but excellent, catalogues by him: Dandy Cart To Diesel (1981) and Image Of The Train (1985 and 1993). The last words of the latter express the hope that his readers, and visitors to the exhibition \"may see here that there is more to the railway than they had supposed before, more to be noticed, and more to be enjoyed\". Jack Simmons helped many people to notice and enjoy not only railways but also landscape and architecture, language and literature, and food and wine. He took an interest in everything around him, and being interested meant making himself knowledgeable. Being knowledgeable meant sharing that knowledge. His last publication was the magisterial, but accessible, Oxford Companion To British Transport History (1997), edited with Gordon Biddle. Its articles add up to a comprehensive story of the rise and fall of British railways. In 1999, Simmons was awarded an OBE. He deserved more. \u0095 Jack Simmons, historian, born August 30 1915; died Septmber 3 2000",

      "bodyText": "A FEW weeks after the Northern Ireland Assembly elections in 1998, a group of armed and masked men entered the home of former republican prisoner Michael Donnelly in Derry. The gang beat Mr Donnelly so severely that both his legs were broken and an arm was shattered. His \"crime\" had been to call for a boycott of the elections in the Creggan area of the city. Mr Donnelly was a member of Republican Sinn Fein, which opposes the Good Friday Agreement. His attackers were local members of the Provisional IRA, who blamed his boycott campaign for a Sinn Fein candidate failing to get elected to the Assembly. The irony of the attack was not lost on hardline republicans. The victim had been tortured by the British Army in Long Kesh (now the Maze) during internment in 1971. Almost three decades later his former comrades had turned on this victim of British injustice just because he stood against the Sinn Fein peace strategy. The attack was meant to instil fear in radical republicans who did not agree with Sinn Fein's embrace of the partitionist agreement. And for a while it worked. There was only muted protest in Derry over the Donnelly attack and few young republicans seemed attracted by RSF's hard-line rhetoric. Last night's attack on Magillian Army camp just outside the city was important more for its symbolism than its destructive substance. Republican and security sources indicated this morning that the Continuity IRA, the paramilitary allies of RSF, was behind the blast. Magilligan became infamous during the early 1970s when civil rights demonstrators, including the SDLP leader John Hume, marched on the base and demanded freedom for internees held behind the barbed wire and the British Army watchtowers. For dissident republicans in the Derry/North-West salient there cannot be a better symbol to attack than Magilligan camp. The explosion also demonstrates that the CIRA and their political allies are confident to carry on their campaign of violence despite opposition, not only from traditional quarters of nationalism like the SDLP, but also Sinn Fein and, in particular, Martin McGuinness, who regards Derry as his home patch. The bombing is not just a challenge to the security forces but also the authority of Mr McGuinness and his party in their stronghold. Most people living in nationalist working-class estates like the Creggan and Galliagh support Sinn Fein's peace strategy and don't wish to see a return to the kind of devastation that wreaked chaos in Derry during the 1970s and 80s. But last night's blast is a reminder that there is a determined and recalcitrant republican minority prepared to risk not only imprisonment at the hands of their traditional enemies but also the wrath of their former comrades. And judging by the amount of pro-CIRA graffiti adorning the walls and bus shelters on the west bank of Derry, there are plenty of young recruits willing to pursue a campaign which men like Mr McGuinness have forsaken for good.",

      "bodyText": "A police station in Northern Ireland was rocked by an explosion today amid growing fears of a new bombing offensive by republican dissidents. The attack happened outside the Royal Ulster Constabulary station in Armagh, on the city's Newry Road. There were no immediate reports of any casualties, according to a police spokesman, but a pregnant woman walking close by narrowly missed being hit by a piece of flying metal, which bounced off a wall. The area was packed at the time with scores of children on their way to school. The mortar was fired from the back of a van parked on the building site of a new hotel and police said it was a \"miracle\" nobody was killed. It was the second attack by republican dissidents in less than 24 hours, confirmed heightening security force fears that the Real IRA, which bombed Omagh, could be launching a new offensive. Earlier a soldier escaped uninjured when an 80lb bomb partially exploded after he opened the door of a wooden hurt at a military training camp at Magilligan, County Londonderry. Another unexploded 80lb bomb was discovered nearby, police disclosed today. Special Branch chiefs in Belfast fear members of the Real IRA - the dissident group responsible for the Omagh bombing - have been preparing to launch a series of attacks across the Province. According to security sources, the group's numbers have been growing in Belfast, Londonderry and south Armagh. The explosion came days after the discovery on Saturday of a firebomb in a soft furnishing shop in English Street in Armagh, but Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said such action would not derail the peace process. He added: \"The people responsible for this will be tracked down and the police and security forces will bring a halt to this sort of activity.We are not going to tolerate any action, from any quarter, to disrupt and destablise the peace process which is so strong and so important to the people of Northern Ireland, and the future of Northern Ireland.\" Chief Inspector Derek Williamson said: \"It was launched without warning in an absolutely indiscriminate fashion and at a time when the place with busy with schoolchildren and people going to work. That showed utter contempt for the lives of everyone in the area. \"It was an attack of murderous intent, and it was all the more despicable because of the ongoing inquest into the Omagh bombing.\"",

Dare you move home or splash out on a new car? Should you save every penny you can in case the worst happens? That, in a nutshell, is the problem that oil-producing countries face on a grand scale. Today, they are wallowing in money with oil at more than $30 a barrel. But early last year it fetched only $10 and everyone had to tighten their belts drastically. The price rollercoaster can play havoc with national budgets and long-term economic planning. Even when times are good, nobody knows how long it will last.

Earlier in the day, bubbling tensions saw two protesters arrested for obstruction at the refinery in Sunderland and a van believed to contain riot police was called in to escort a tanker through blockades in Essex as it delivered fuel to a filling station. Central London became off-limits at lunchtime as more than 200 lorries converged on the area surrounding Trafalgar Square, in a bid to take their protest directly to the government at nearby Parliament Square. Prime Minister Tony Blair had summoned oil company heads to Downing Street for more round-the-table talks aimed at getting Britain moving, after earlier promising the nation things would begin returning to normality by Wednesday evening. And outside Number Ten, Shell chief executive Malcolm Brinder delivered a joint statement with John Manzoni his opposite number at BP, saying \"every effort\" would be made to comply with the emergency powers the government had implemented to ensure \"the maintenance of services essential to the running of the country. \"We will be stepping this up as soon as possible to get back to normal,\" he added. From Conservative Central Office, Tory leader William Hague called on Mr Blair to apologise for the situation and he accused the Government of failing to \"get a grip\" on a crisis which it had itself caused. He said: \"Their (the government's) sheer arrogance and refusal to take on board the public's grievances shows them to be an out-of-touch and tax-raising Government that has failed to get a grip on this crisis,\" However, Mr Hague urged protesters campaigning against high fuel duty to end their blockades of oil refineries and allow the country to get back to normal.

There is no ready-made language to describe this particular enemy of the people, the militant chambers of commerce. Meanwhile the unions parrot gleefully what the Rotarians used to say back in the 70s: Sir Ken Jackson of the AEEU, \"They have to understand the damage being caused to the economy;\" and John Edmonds of GMB, \"Ministers must not allow themselves to bow to these demonstrations by small businessmen and Tory supporters.\" Quite right too.</p> <p>These protesters are a small, tightly knit group of politically motivated men. Take the farmers. They have been blockading supermarkets over the falling price of milk - hardly a popular cause - but now they have found petrol hits the spot. But what cheek. Red diesel for tractors is taxed at just 3p a litre while ordinary diesel is taxed at 48p a litre, so it is time they got their state- subsidised tractors off our lawns. Their real grudge against Labour is ideological, angry at the right to roam and the banning of fox hunting. (Why were the protesters outside John Prescott's anniversary dinner in Hull yelling about banning hunting as well as petrol prices?) As ever, farmers seem oblivious of their special \u00a33bn a year welfare state for producing 1% of GDP. Here's an interesting fact: in all Wales there are 2,000 civil servants to cover everything, but nearly a quarter of them are clerks engaged full-time in processing claims and paying out grants to farmers. (Poor rural dwellers hit by fuel prices could be far better targeted with council tax cuts.)</p> <p>As for the truckers, they are highly selective when comparing petrol taxes with the rest of Europe. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) complains about unfair competition from French trucks, made worse now Jospin (so recently reviled by the right for caving in) has slashed their fuel tax rates. A French truck, says the RHA, can fill up in Calais, unload in Scotland, steal many small jobs from British firms on the way home all on one mighty tank. But do these British companies really want tax harmonisation with the French? If they had French petrol tax, would they accept French income tax, corporation tax and road tolls too?</p> <p>The Greedy Gordon attack carries some weight. The price rise from $10 to $34 a barrel in just 18 months should bring him in a windfall in extra VAT on fuel and extra revenues from the North Sea. Most estimates suggest \u00a31bn, the Mail came up with \u00a34bn. But until the end of the year it's unknowable and even then hard to calculate. If people are spending more on petrol, they are spending less elsewhere, so other tax revenues drop as company profits fall. But if at the end of the year there is a clear Treasury bonus, then the chancellor should commit that sum unequivocally to green investment in desperately under-subsidised renewable energy projects or public transport. (Or how about free buses for under 21s?)</p> <p>The government has sounded weak in this debate because Tony Blair never talks green. He is happy administering the thwack of firm government but green is for wimps. However this argument must be fought and won on its own merits. Friends of the Earth point out that road transport is the second fastest growing British source of carbon emissions and drivers still don't pay the true cost of their driving. Road transport costs the environment \u00a342bn a year but tax raised from road transport is only \u00a323bn. Government figures show how the cost of motoring has not changed in real terms in the past 25 years while train fares have risen by 53% and bus fares by 87%. We would be better off with fewer hauliers: 40 years ago more than half of all freight went by rail, now it is only 7%, although each ton transported by road gives out 80% more CO&lt;-&gt;2 <!----> than by rail.</p> <p>There was a sigh of relief at the weekend when Opec agreed to increase oil production by 800,000 barrels to try to ease prices. But those extra barrels will add 1/2% to the total global output of CO&lt;-&gt;2 <!----> at a time when the world is committed to reducing emissions by 7%. What a small puff of protest it took to blow the world off course. Environmentalists watching the protest spread right across Europe wait in trepidation to see whether most EU leaders will take the Blair or the Jospin route. At the November climate change summit in the Hague they had hoped for a united European front to shame the Americans, whose CO&lt;-&gt;2 <!----> emissions have risen by 20% instead of the cut they agreed at Kyoto. (Their cars use twice as much petrol, which is cheaper than Coca-cola). The fear is that the US will just laugh at a shamefaced Europe, where country after country has caved in at the first challenge.</p> <p>By chance this is the government's Flood Action Week, warning that global warming means a 10-fold flood increase this century. It looks depressingly unlikely that politics can deliver enough - or any - belt-tightening to save the world from global warming. The only hope is that higher prices make the cost of alternatives (wind and solar power) commercially enticing. It is happening in countries where governments kick-started it with heavy subsidies but Britain is losing out. (BP moved its solar panel factory to Europe.) Denmark is now the world's manufacturer of windmills, not us, though we have half of all Europe's wind potential.</p> <p>People in cars are transmogrified into \"the motorist\", a less sociable political animal than when they are \"parents\" or \"employees\" or even \"voters\". Why does petrol stir such fury? Every 1% rise in interest rates costs the average family \u00a310 a week on their mortgage, but there are no interest-rate protests, nor celebrations at inflation falling yesterday. Margaret Thatcher's deadly political instinct recognised the car as her great ally, her symbol of individual selfishness. New Labour has yet to find an eloquent language or attractive policies to tackle it. Now it must.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

But those extra barrels will add 1/2% to the total global output of CO&lt;-&gt;2 at a time when the world is committed to reducing emissions by 7%. What a small puff of protest it took to blow the world off course. Environmentalists watching the protest spread right across Europe wait in trepidation to see whether most EU leaders will take the Blair or the Jospin route. At the November climate change summit in the Hague they had hoped for a united European front to shame the Americans, whose CO&lt;-&gt;2 emissions have risen by 20% instead of the cut they agreed at Kyoto. (Their cars use twice as much petrol, which is cheaper than Coca-cola). The fear is that the US will just laugh at a shamefaced Europe, where country after country has caved in at the first challenge. By chance this is the government's Flood Action Week, warning that global warming means a 10-fold flood increase this century. It looks depressingly unlikely that politics can deliver enough - or any - belt-tightening to save the world from global warming. The only hope is that higher prices make the cost of alternatives (wind and solar power) commercially enticing. It is happening in countries where governments kick-started it with heavy subsidies but Britain is losing out. (BP moved its solar panel factory to Europe.) Denmark is now the world's manufacturer of windmills, not us, though we have half of all Europe's wind potential. People in cars are transmogrified into \"the motorist\", a less sociable political animal than when they are \"parents\" or \"employees\" or even \"voters\". Why does petrol stir such fury? Every 1% rise in interest rates costs the average family \u00a310 a week on their mortgage, but there are no interest-rate protests, nor celebrations at inflation falling yesterday. Margaret Thatcher's deadly political instinct recognised the car as her great ally, her symbol of individual selfishness. New Labour has yet to find an eloquent language or attractive policies to tackle it. Now it must. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

Instead, William Hague pronounced this a crisis \"made in Downing Street.\"</p> <p>In one sense he is right. The roots of this crisis are in Downing Street, though at Number 11, not Number 10 and in 1993, not 2000. It was then, in one of the few environmentally responsible actions that the Tory government ever undertook, that the then chancellor of the exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, brought in the fuel duty escalator, which automatically raised fuel duty above the level of inflation each year. Its purpose, apart from being a nice little earner for the Treasury, was to increase the cost of fuel to reflect the true environmental cost of motoring.</p> <p>So if Mr Hague is looking for someone to blame, he could start a little closer to home than Tony Blair.</p> <p>Mr Blair is far from blameless, but not in the way Mr Hague means. Labour's promise of an integrated transport policy that would be about more than just building roads - in honour of its pledge to \"reduce then reverse traffic growth\" - has been progressively enfeebled until now we have arrived at Lord MacDonald's formula of more roads and by-passes.</p> <p>And the government enjoyed the benefits of increased taxes on motoring. Mr Blair was hostile to investment in the alternatives that John Prescott initially advocated. High fuel taxes and good public transport would feel a lot better than high fuel taxes and public transport that is inadequate, dirty, unreliable and expensive as usual.</p> <p>But the truckers, farmers and fishermen who have brought us to this pass are not lobbying for better public transport. They are, rather, the battering ram that an unwholesome coalition of the Tory party, the tabloid press and a group of disaffected interest groups has managed to direct at the government.</p> <p>Riding on the back of an assorted collection of grievances there is a political agenda. The men on the picket line claim that their action is spontaneous: according to the Devon farmer Richard Haddock of Farmers for Action, it was the French example last week that set his own phone ringing. Like many of this week's protesters, he had not been active in protests before. Now he spends most of his waking hours on the picket line in the company, he says, of an unstructured assortment of OAPs, fishermen and truckers.</p> <p>It's an effective combination: the lack of formal involvement of big interest groups such as the NFU (who are sympathetic, according to Mr Haddock) means that there are no easy targets for injunctions and the passivity of the oil companies suggests they have, in any case, little to lose in this dispute. The combination of mobile phones and the internet makes networking easy and cheap.</p> <p>The protesting farmers, like the fishermen and the truckers, are fuelled by a raging sense of grievance and a powerful feeling that nobody cares. Now they have found a way of getting our attention. But try to get hold of their case and it's not easy to see how lowering excise duty on fuel would solve their problems. Mr Haddock's grievances, shared by thousands of small farmers, encompass everything from the havoc wrought by the BSE crisis to the low prices he receives for his crops.</p> <p>Nobody argues that farmers are having a good time, but the fact is that they pay almost no excise tax on the fuel they use on their farms, which makes them one of the few groups in the country who cannot reasonably blame the Treasury for the rise in fuel costs. The fishermen, too, have their troubles. But they pay no excise duty on their fuel at all, so for them to castigate fuel tax is doubly irrational. And as for the truckers, interesting though it is to see such a conservative body arguing for tax harmonisation with the EU, we should take it seriously only if it includes harmonisation - upwards - of business and income tax and of the wider cost of motoring, including motorway tolls. Level the playing field, by all means, but level all of it, and join the single currency while we are at it.</p> <p>So why target fuel taxes? Partly because paralysing transport is a devastatingly effective weapon that has been used to great effect in the past by interest groups who want to make political chaos: when the CIA wanted to destabilise Salvador Allende's Chile in the early 1970s, they organised a truckers' strike because they knew that if they paralysed the roads and interrupted food supplies, they could create unrest and make the government look weak and incompetent. Add to that the hectoring of the newspaper El Mercurio, heavily subsidised by the CIA at the time, which mobilised its middle-class readers in Santiago to bang their saucepans for all the world as though they were hungry. Within days they had the desired disorder, all created under the cloak of what was made to appear like popular protest.</p> <p>In Northern Ireland the Ulster Workers' Council strike of 1974, called by Loyalists unhappy with the Sunningdale power-sharing agreement, also targeted transport and succeeded in breaking the power-sharing executive. That was not a popular protest in the pure sense of the word either, but an example of effective popular mobilisation for political ends.</p> <p>Nor, so far, is the petrol war a popular protest against the government, though as it escalates and with the inflammatory urging of the tabloids it could become so.</p> <p>As far as the grievances on the picket lines are concerned, several palliatives suggest themselves. Britain could join the implausibly named Euroflutter scheme, which would impose a tax on foreign trucks using British roads. The farmers' prices could be made to reflect the cost of production. Or farm subsidies could be directed away from the big farmers to the small producers.</p> <p>But the one option that does not appeal is that the government lower the duty on fuel. In a stand-off like this, nobody interested in democratic government has an interest in seeing the government give way.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Scarred by the experiences of the miners' strike when they were accused of being Margaret Thatcher's stormtroopers, forces re very reluctant to be drawn into protracted conflict again.</p> <p>\"Policing by consent is what it is all about in Britain,\" said Kevin Morris, president-elect of the Police Superintendents Association and a veteran of policing protests against live animal exports in Shoreham. \"It would be appalling to go back to the way things were during the miners' strike. We don't want to get involved with that again.\"</p> <p>Circumstances are different now. Before the miners' strike, the Conservatives introduced specific powers through the Employment Act of 1980 and 1982 to restrict picketing and secondary picketing.</p> <p>\"The government introduced laws to deliberately take on the miners in an industrial dispute and even then it took nine months to defeat them,\" Mr Morris added. \"This is not an industrial dispute in the same way. It is a dispute involving an industry but there are different parties involved so those powers cannot be used.\"</p> <p>The police can turn to the 1980 Road Traffic Act and the 1986 Public Order Act. They give officers the right to intervene when protesters are obstructing the highway or if they are turning violent. There are also common law powers relating to unlawful assembly and breaches of peace.</p> <p>So far, there has been little appetite to use them. Other factors have also steered the police towards a policy of non-intervention. People are allowed to protest lawfully and human rights legislation demands that the police response be \"proportional\".</p> <p>Many of the demonstrators have allowed emergency supplies to leave the refineries after talks with the police, so is it \"proportional\" to break up a peaceful protest forcibly, probably with an inevitable escalation to violence?</p> <p>There are practical problems too. Very few police officers have heavy goods vehicle licences. If hauliers are arrested, the police will not be able to drive their lorries away. Officers would rather take the details of protesters and deal with them later rather than be confrontational.</p> <p>\"The government and the police have to respect the fact that these protests seem to have widespread public support,\" Mr Morris said.</p> <p>Privately, senior officers say they would prefer the government to sanction army intervention rather than applying pressure on them to act.</p> <p>Although the police have made it clear this is not a mess of their making, the forces were undoubtedly caught on the hop by the escalation of the dispute.</p> <p>There was very little, if any intelligence on the likelihood of demonstrations, which has forced the police to adopt a defensive position.</p> <p>The national information centre, at Scotland Yard, is used to coordinate police resourcing of critical situations, such as Millennium eve, and is linked to the Metropolitan police's \"golf tango\" special operations unit, which oversees London's uniformed response to emergency situations.</p> <p>\"There is no frustration between the police and Mr Straw,\" said a Home Office spokesman. \"He respects the position the police are in. A strategy is being formulated but it is being kept under wraps unless and until it is needed.\"</p>",

Although yesterday's meetings were amicable, Sir John reminded the Home Secretary that chief constables are \"operationally independent\" and will not bow to pressure to use force against demonstrators. Before yesterday the police had done very little to stop protesters setting up camp outside refineries and depots, preferring to \"manage\" the demonstrations as best they could once they were in place. Many senior officers believe the government has drifted unwittingly into a full scale crisis and cannot look to the police to sort it out. Scarred by the experiences of the miners' strike when they were accused of being Margaret Thatcher's stormtroopers, forces re very reluctant to be drawn into protracted conflict again. \"Policing by consent is what it is all about in Britain,\" said Kevin Morris, president-elect of the Police Superintendents Association and a veteran of policing protests against live animal exports in Shoreham. \"It would be appalling to go back to the way things were during the miners' strike. We don't want to get involved with that again.\" Circumstances are different now. Before the miners' strike, the Conservatives introduced specific powers through the Employment Act of 1980 and 1982 to restrict picketing and secondary picketing. \"The government introduced laws to deliberately take on the miners in an industrial dispute and even then it took nine months to defeat them,\" Mr Morris added. \"This is not an industrial dispute in the same way. It is a dispute involving an industry but there are different parties involved so those powers cannot be used.\" The police can turn to the 1980 Road Traffic Act and the 1986 Public Order Act. They give officers the right to intervene when protesters are obstructing the highway or if they are turning violent. There are also common law powers relating to unlawful assembly and breaches of peace. So far, there has been little appetite to use them. Other factors have also steered the police towards a policy of non-intervention. People are allowed to protest lawfully and human rights legislation demands that the police response be \"proportional\". Many of the demonstrators have allowed emergency supplies to leave the refineries after talks with the police, so is it \"proportional\" to break up a peaceful protest forcibly, probably with an inevitable escalation to violence? There are practical problems too. Very few police officers have heavy goods vehicle licences. If hauliers are arrested, the police will not be able to drive their lorries away. Officers would rather take the details of protesters and deal with them later rather than be confrontational. \"The government and the police have to respect the fact that these protests seem to have widespread public support,\" Mr Morris said. Privately, senior officers say they would prefer the government to sanction army intervention rather than applying pressure on them to act. Although the police have made it clear this is not a mess of their making, the forces were undoubtedly caught on the hop by the escalation of the dispute. There was very little, if any intelligence on the likelihood of demonstrations, which has forced the police to adopt a defensive position. The national information centre, at Scotland Yard, is used to coordinate police resourcing of critical situations, such as Millennium eve, and is linked to the Metropolitan police's \"golf tango\" special operations unit, which oversees London's uniformed response to emergency situations. \"There is no frustration between the police and Mr Straw,\" said a Home Office spokesman. \"He respects the position the police are in. A strategy is being formulated but it is being kept under wraps unless and until it is needed.\"",

      "body": "<p>The oil companies were on a collision course with Tony Blair last night over their failure to dispatch tankers from storage depots immediately to replenish the country's empty petrol stations.</p> <p>With a relatively small number of pickets managing to immobilise Britain, some ministers privately accused the companies of either colluding with the protesters or taking a line of no resistance.</p> <p>Police around the country insist that there is free movement in most areas and only limited picketing. But outside some depots small groups of protesters are discussing with managers which deliveries should be allowed and giving \"dispensations\" only to fuel for the emergency services.</p> <p>After crisis talks in Downing Street, John Prescott gave a hint of the government's frustration by telling the companies that it was their responsibility to ensure that supplies got to the forecourts.</p> <p>Ray Holloway, director of the Petrol Retailers Association, said it was right to ask why tankers were being kept in the depots despite the fact that the police had cleared almost all the blockades.</p> <p>\"It is reasonable to postulate that the oil companies have made a collective decision not to send out their tankers. We have to establish whether there is a real picket line and there is danger to the drivers, or if it is just protesters. And if there is no picket line, then you would be perfectly right to ask why not.\"</p> <p>The government's anger was underlined by Lord Mackenzie, a former senior policeman who now advises the home secretary, Jack Straw, on law and order, who said he was baffled that tankers were not leaving depots.</p> <p>\"It does not add up to me,\" he said. \"The people who are demonstrating, in a sense, I suppose, are supporters of the Conservative party. There's something not right about it. It's not a normal demonstration and they should get their sleeves rolled up and start delivering the oil where it belongs, at the petrol stations.\"</p> <p>Lord Mackenzie, a senior officer during the l984-5 miners' strike, said many protests seemed so minimal that they could not be regarded as picketing. \"Roads are often not blocked - if they were, the police would not hesitate in arresting people,\" he said. \"It seems to be the companies causing the difficulty, and there does seem some collusion with the protesters. Perhaps it's because if the fuel duty was reduced they would sell more petrol.\"</p> <p>With conspiracy theories flying thick and fast, Dave Bryan, the TGWU transport union national officer representing truckers, said tankers were idle \"because there has been a number of incidents in recent days where drivers have been physically abused by motorists and even followed home there is evidence of intimidation\".</p> <p>When the Guardian contacted several leading oil companies, they maintained a common line. Asked why their tankers were not leaving refineries and depots, a spokeswoman for Shell - more than half of whose 1,100 stations are running dry - said: \"We are concerned for the safety of our drivers and do not want to take any risk.\"</p> <p>Asked what threats drivers were facing, she mentioned an \"incident\" last Friday in which a traffic cone was thrown at a tanker.</p> <p>BP, with close to three quarters of its 1,500 stations out of action, came close to hinting it that was the victim of a government-inspired smear campaign, and said tankers would only leave depots with a police escort.</p> <p>The oil companies have been making bumper profits as the result of soaring crude prices, but not from the higher pump prices. Their profit margins on the forecourt are slim because of intense competition .</p> <p>Their profit comes from the rise in wholesale price of the oil they sell on to other corporations. They would like to see the government reduce the cut it takes at the petrol pump to stop consumer anger.</p> <p>In theory the companies can take out injunctions to remove the protesters from their depots and refineries.</p> <p>Andrew Ward, the corporate communications manager of TotalElfFina, told the BBC: \"We have investigated the legal implications of this. We are advised injunctions would be difficult because the protest is not by an official union presence, so therefore it would be difficult to serve injunctions, because we would have to serve many injunctions on individuals.\"</p> <p>Told that the police were saying that the roads were free of illegal picketing, he replied: \"We are at the moment liaising with police on a terminal basis to try and get our vehicles out of the terminals.\"</p> <p>Later, a company spokesman said \"The mood of the protesters is fairly amicable, and if we were to send drivers out it might change. Getting fuel to the pumps would only solve the short-term problem and not deal with the original concerns of protesters.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The oil companies were on a collision course with Tony Blair last night over their failure to dispatch tankers from storage depots immediately to replenish the country's empty petrol stations. With a relatively small number of pickets managing to immobilise Britain, some ministers privately accused the companies of either colluding with the protesters or taking a line of no resistance. Police around the country insist that there is free movement in most areas and only limited picketing. But outside some depots small groups of protesters are discussing with managers which deliveries should be allowed and giving \"dispensations\" only to fuel for the emergency services. After crisis talks in Downing Street, John Prescott gave a hint of the government's frustration by telling the companies that it was their responsibility to ensure that supplies got to the forecourts. Ray Holloway, director of the Petrol Retailers Association, said it was right to ask why tankers were being kept in the depots despite the fact that the police had cleared almost all the blockades. \"It is reasonable to postulate that the oil companies have made a collective decision not to send out their tankers. We have to establish whether there is a real picket line and there is danger to the drivers, or if it is just protesters. And if there is no picket line, then you would be perfectly right to ask why not.\" The government's anger was underlined by Lord Mackenzie, a former senior policeman who now advises the home secretary, Jack Straw, on law and order, who said he was baffled that tankers were not leaving depots. \"It does not add up to me,\" he said. \"The people who are demonstrating, in a sense, I suppose, are supporters of the Conservative party. There's something not right about it. It's not a normal demonstration and they should get their sleeves rolled up and start delivering the oil where it belongs, at the petrol stations.\" Lord Mackenzie, a senior officer during the l984-5 miners' strike, said many protests seemed so minimal that they could not be regarded as picketing. \"Roads are often not blocked - if they were, the police would not hesitate in arresting people,\" he said. \"It seems to be the companies causing the difficulty, and there does seem some collusion with the protesters. Perhaps it's because if the fuel duty was reduced they would sell more petrol.\" With conspiracy theories flying thick and fast, Dave Bryan, the TGWU transport union national officer representing truckers, said tankers were idle \"because there has been a number of incidents in recent days where drivers have been physically abused by motorists and even followed home there is evidence of intimidation\". When the Guardian contacted several leading oil companies, they maintained a common line. Asked why their tankers were not leaving refineries and depots, a spokeswoman for Shell - more than half of whose 1,100 stations are running dry - said: \"We are concerned for the safety of our drivers and do not want to take any risk.\" Asked what threats drivers were facing, she mentioned an \"incident\" last Friday in which a traffic cone was thrown at a tanker. BP, with close to three quarters of its 1,500 stations out of action, came close to hinting it that was the victim of a government-inspired smear campaign, and said tankers would only leave depots with a police escort. The oil companies have been making bumper profits as the result of soaring crude prices, but not from the higher pump prices. Their profit margins on the forecourt are slim because of intense competition . Their profit comes from the rise in wholesale price of the oil they sell on to other corporations. They would like to see the government reduce the cut it takes at the petrol pump to stop consumer anger. In theory the companies can take out injunctions to remove the protesters from their depots and refineries. Andrew Ward, the corporate communications manager of TotalElfFina, told the BBC: \"We have investigated the legal implications of this. We are advised injunctions would be difficult because the protest is not by an official union presence, so therefore it would be difficult to serve injunctions, because we would have to serve many injunctions on individuals.\" Told that the police were saying that the roads were free of illegal picketing, he replied: \"We are at the moment liaising with police on a terminal basis to try and get our vehicles out of the terminals.\" Later, a company spokesman said \"The mood of the protesters is fairly amicable, and if we were to send drivers out it might change. Getting fuel to the pumps would only solve the short-term problem and not deal with the original concerns of protesters.\"",

Trying to bring the country to a halt is quite another,\" he said.</p> <p>Raising already impossibly high stakes, Mr Blair said: \"Were we to yield to that pressure it would run counter to every democratic principle this country believes in, and what is more, if the government was to decide its policy on taxes in response to such behaviour, the credibility of economic policy vital to any country would be severely damaged.</p> <p>\"I will simply not allow that to happen.\"</p> <p>In a frantic attempt to prevent Britain descending into total chaos, Mr Blair spent the afternoon on the phone urging the chairmen and chief executives of the five big oil companies to force their tanker drivers to recommence supplies.</p> <p>There has been suspicion in the government for some time that the oil companies have been sitting on their hands, either because they would like to see fuel duty cut or because their employees are sympathetic towards the road hauliers.</p> <p>Ministers acknowledge that they have been urging greater coordination between the oil companies and the police for 48 hours, with little sign that the drivers are willing to break the blockades and restore the deliveries of non-essential supplies.</p> <p>After his round of phone calls to the oil bosses, Mr Blair said: \"We have made the necessary emergency order of council. The oil companies are agreed that they must move supplies.\"</p> <p>The police had agreed to do \"all that is necessary\" to protect against intimidation.</p> <p>\"The main union concerned has issued a strong statement urging members to work normally.</p> <p>\"Everything is now in place to get the tankers moving. We hope in the next 24 hours to have the situation on the way back to normal. It will take longer than that to be fully back to normal.\"</p> <p>If there is no significant breakthrough, Mr Blair will be forced to invoke emergency powers and send in the army to take over the distribution of petrol.</p> <p>Exposing the deep fears in the cabinet about the political implications of this crisis, the Education Secretary, David Blunkett, became the first minister to draw open parallels with the Winter of Discontent of 1979-80, saying: \"We are all bound by our history and remember the 'Crisis? What crisis'.\"</p> <p>At a round of meetings of the civil contingency committee yesterday, plans were laid for designating 150 petrol stations around the country for the exclusive supply of petrol to the emergency services. Meetings were held at the Department of Trade and Industry with the petrol retailers to organise supplies.</p> <p>The only sign of a political concession by Mr Blair were some hints that he would be willing to cut petrol duty in the Budget, or the pre-budget report in November.</p> <p>He said: \"The proper time to make proper budget judgments is at the time of the budget, when the year can be looked at as a whole.\"</p> <p>Mr Blair was hoping that a strong plea to the tanker drivers from Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, would have some influence on the tanker drivers.</p> <p>Mr Morris warned the drivers that they had to go back to work, saying: \"The campaign has crossed the line from democracy and into anarchy.\"</p> <p>Other union leaders called on the pickets to be hauled in front of the courts, just as striking miners were in the 80s.</p> <p>However, many of the drivers are not members of the TGWU, and even more are unlikely to be moved by Mr Morris's instructions.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair was at the centre of an extraordinary attempt to prevent the British economy collapsing into total paralysis last night when he made a series of personal pleas to oil bosses to instruct their tanker drivers to restore exhausted supplies to the country's petrol stations. But with Britain's car- and road-based economy less than 48 hours from total shutdown, endangering hospital operations and food supplies, there was no immediate sign that the majority of tanker drivers would respond. Mr Blair promised the oil companies that the police would provide complete protection to drivers, including escorts. The tanker drivers, many of them sympathetic to the road hauliers' complaints, say they are too frightened to drive out of the refineries and oil depots. But, giving the first indication that the police will get tough with the protesters, an order was served on 20 pickets last night to leave private property to stop blocking refineries in Colwick, Nottinghamshire. The Police Superintendents' Association said officers would have no choice but to make sure that tankers were able to leave depots and deliver their fuel if oil companies decided to send them out. A spokeswoman for BP said the company planned to move petrol once \"assurances\" had been given about drivers' safety. It was \"speculation\" to say that drivers might refuse to cross the protest lines, and might take strike action if forced to do so. Last night tankers taking petrol to empty filling stations left Purfleet refinery, in Essex: the first sign that the crisis might be easing. A police officer sat beside the driver of each tanker and police cars drove alongside as an escort. In Downing Street the government's civil contingencies committee was monitoring movements. By the time Mr Blair spoke, the petrol companies were predicting that 90% of their stations would have run out of fuel by this morning. The monumental scale of the crisis yesterday hit the transport system, the health service, food supplies, schools and businesses. A dramatic day started with the Prime Minister abandoning a visit to Yorkshire and rushing back to Downing Street to take personal charge of a round of crisis meetings. Despite further panic buying and continuing public support for the protests, Mr Blair gave an early evening press conference vowing that he would not buckle. He insisted that the government could not change tax policy between budgets in response \"to blockades, illegal pickets and direct action\". \"Legitimate protest is one thing. Trying to bring the country to a halt is quite another,\" he said. Raising already impossibly high stakes, Mr Blair said: \"Were we to yield to that pressure it would run counter to every democratic principle this country believes in, and what is more, if the government was to decide its policy on taxes in response to such behaviour, the credibility of economic policy vital to any country would be severely damaged. \"I will simply not allow that to happen.\" In a frantic attempt to prevent Britain descending into total chaos, Mr Blair spent the afternoon on the phone urging the chairmen and chief executives of the five big oil companies to force their tanker drivers to recommence supplies. There has been suspicion in the government for some time that the oil companies have been sitting on their hands, either because they would like to see fuel duty cut or because their employees are sympathetic towards the road hauliers. Ministers acknowledge that they have been urging greater coordination between the oil companies and the police for 48 hours, with little sign that the drivers are willing to break the blockades and restore the deliveries of non-essential supplies. After his round of phone calls to the oil bosses, Mr Blair said: \"We have made the necessary emergency order of council. The oil companies are agreed that they must move supplies.\" The police had agreed to do \"all that is necessary\" to protect against intimidation. \"The main union concerned has issued a strong statement urging members to work normally. \"Everything is now in place to get the tankers moving. We hope in the next 24 hours to have the situation on the way back to normal. It will take longer than that to be fully back to normal.\" If there is no significant breakthrough, Mr Blair will be forced to invoke emergency powers and send in the army to take over the distribution of petrol. Exposing the deep fears in the cabinet about the political implications of this crisis, the Education Secretary, David Blunkett, became the first minister to draw open parallels with the Winter of Discontent of 1979-80, saying: \"We are all bound by our history and remember the 'Crisis? What crisis'.\" At a round of meetings of the civil contingency committee yesterday, plans were laid for designating 150 petrol stations around the country for the exclusive supply of petrol to the emergency services. Meetings were held at the Department of Trade and Industry with the petrol retailers to organise supplies. The only sign of a political concession by Mr Blair were some hints that he would be willing to cut petrol duty in the Budget, or the pre-budget report in November. He said: \"The proper time to make proper budget judgments is at the time of the budget, when the year can be looked at as a whole.\" Mr Blair was hoping that a strong plea to the tanker drivers from Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, would have some influence on the tanker drivers. Mr Morris warned the drivers that they had to go back to work, saying: \"The campaign has crossed the line from democracy and into anarchy.\" Other union leaders called on the pickets to be hauled in front of the courts, just as striking miners were in the 80s. However, many of the drivers are not members of the TGWU, and even more are unlikely to be moved by Mr Morris's instructions.",

      "body": "<p>Returning from the UN special assembly in New York last week, Tony Blair was relatively confident that his government would see off the just-gathering petrol blockades.</p> <p>In a private conversation, President Jacques Chirac had told him that the French government would not make concessions to the farmers and hauliers paralysing his country. It seemed to Mr Blair that this might even be the moment when the Socialist French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, confronted the labour unions and irrevocably joined the Blairite Third Way.</p> <p>By the weekend Mr Blair was rudely disappointed as Mr Jospin succumbed first to the fishermen and then to the hauliers.</p> <p>Just as capital has globalised, so has protest. It gave fresh heart to the nascent demonstrations in Britain.</p> <p>But at Chequers Mr Blair had other things on his mind. He had sent troops to fight in the Sierra Leone jungle, and he had to brace himself for the potentially damaging serialised books portraying a feuding cabinet and a jealous chancellor.</p> <p>Over the weekend he held two conversations with Gordon Brown, and they agreed that the best solution was to put pressure on Opec members, particularly the Saudis, to bring the price of oil down to as low as $24 a barrel.</p> <p><b> Caught out</b><br></p> <p>Mr Brown, who had been repeatedly warned by Scottish Labour MPs of the danger of the high petrol prices, promised that he would ensure that EU finance ministers stood firm against fuel tax cuts. The pressure on Opec to increase output would remain.</p> <p>In retrospect, Whitehall admits that it was slow to recognise the speed with which the crisis would escalate. Mentally, ministers remembered the miners' strike of 1984-5 and the unions' failure to halt energy supplies. No one foresaw the scale of the menace ahead. One reason for that, it seems, is that there is no coordinating machinery to report to ministers that garage forecourts could be pumped dry.</p> <p>By Sunday, however, it was apparent that panic buying was starting to eat into supplies much faster than expected, especially in the north and Wales. It was agreed that Jack Straw, the Home Secretary, should convene an emergency meeting of the civil contingencies committee.</p> <p>It was also agreed that Mr Blair should go ahead with a two-day visit to the midlands and Yorkshire, designed to highlight the burgeoning dot.com economy. Cancelling would be to betray signs of panic and increase the run on petrol.</p> <p>The visit rapidly developed a surreal quality. The more Mr Blair enthused about the increasing pace of internet traffic in Britain, the slower vehicle traffic moved around the country. Privately, he knew that two of his industry ministers had rushed to Balmoral for the Queen's consent to invoke emergency powers.</p> <p>He had decided that he faced a battle of wills. There would be no change in petrol duty outside the normal budgetary cycle. He would not meet the protesters, or even the Road Haulage Association. The price of petrol was not out of line with Europe, and in any case the farmers did not pay special levies.</p> <p>The country would have to be patient as the oil price came down. In Thatcherite tones, he told colleagues that he would not be held to ransom. \"We cannot allow what happened in France to happen here.\"</p> <p>But there was also a mystery. His Whitehall planners had told him there were enough oil refineries, and enough of them unblocked, to ensure a proper flow of petrol. The picketing was good-natured and did not represent a genuine unlawful blockade, the police had reported. The oil companies said their drivers feared physical intimidation if they went through the picket lines.</p> <p>Mr Blair concluded that there needed to be greater coordination between the oil companies and the police.The police said the depot exits could be cleared if the tanker drivers were willing to use them. The oil companies said otherwise: the safety of their drivers was paramount.</p> <p>Why were the oil companies refusing to ask their drivers to go through the picket lines? One view in government circles is that oil company drivers have a lot of sympathy with the hauliers. They do the same job, share the same motorway cafes, and know that many hauliers are close to the financial edge. Some political sources pointed out that the oil companies had little economic stake in preserving the current level of petrol duty.</p> <p>By mid-evening he knew his tour was becoming untenable. The last straw came when he had to pull out of a dinner to celebrate John Prescott's 30 years as a Hull MP: protesters had blocked the routes to the restaurant with their cars. He drove back to the Sheffield Hilton where, in further overnight conversations, it was agreed that he had to return to London.</p> <p>The Education Secretary, David Blunkett, was left to spell out the eerie historical parallels with the Winter of Discontent. He said: \"We are all bound in by our history and we all remember the 'Crisis? What crisis?' of 30 years ago. The Prime Minister needs to be able to sit down, take the necessary advice and to decide what measures need to be taken. We are on the edge of a very real problem. The problem we face is panic buying. We need to ask people to be very calm, not [to] believe we are going to run out of petrol.\"</p> <p>By lunchtime Mr Blair was in Downing Street discussing the crisis with Mr Prescott; the Chief Secretary, Andrew Smith; the police; civil servants; the Industry Secretary, Mr Byers; and Mr Straw. Once again he focused on the companies' refusal to distribute petrol and decided to speak to their chief executives personally.</p> <p>At lunchtime Mr Prescott finally made the government's anger clear. \"We are quite convinced that the oil companies can face up to their responsibilities to see that oil is distributed properly.\"</p> <p><b>The special powers:</b></p> <p>\u0095 The Queen has given the government unprecedented powers to assume control of fuel distribution to keep the emergency services going: the cabinet's emergency contingency committee can instruct oil companies to deliver to ambulances, hospitals and schools</p> <p>\u0095 Ministers on the committee are expected to list up to 200 filling stations solely for the emergency services. Police will be in attendance in case of protests</p> <p>\u0095 If necessary the provision can be extended to buses and supermarkets to ensure that food supplies are maintained</p> <p>\u0095 At the Balmoral Privy Council meeting the Queen approved an order in council to set in motion the powers \"because there is imminent in the United Kingdom a threatened emergency affecting fuel supplies which make it necessary in Her Majesty's Opinion that the government should temporarily have at its disposal exceptional powers for controlling the sources and availability of energy\"</p> <p>\u0095 If protesters refuse to let oil tankers leave refineries, the government could fall back on a 1,500-mile network of pipes, normally used to to distribute fuel to military bases, to distribute civilian fuel</p> <p><b> Nicholas Watt </b> and<b> Michael White</b></p>",

Cancelling would be to betray signs of panic and increase the run on petrol. The visit rapidly developed a surreal quality. The more Mr Blair enthused about the increasing pace of internet traffic in Britain, the slower vehicle traffic moved around the country. Privately, he knew that two of his industry ministers had rushed to Balmoral for the Queen's consent to invoke emergency powers. He had decided that he faced a battle of wills. There would be no change in petrol duty outside the normal budgetary cycle. He would not meet the protesters, or even the Road Haulage Association. The price of petrol was not out of line with Europe, and in any case the farmers did not pay special levies. The country would have to be patient as the oil price came down. In Thatcherite tones, he told colleagues that he would not be held to ransom. \"We cannot allow what happened in France to happen here.\" But there was also a mystery. His Whitehall planners had told him there were enough oil refineries, and enough of them unblocked, to ensure a proper flow of petrol. The picketing was good-natured and did not represent a genuine unlawful blockade, the police had reported. The oil companies said their drivers feared physical intimidation if they went through the picket lines. Mr Blair concluded that there needed to be greater coordination between the oil companies and the police.The police said the depot exits could be cleared if the tanker drivers were willing to use them. The oil companies said otherwise: the safety of their drivers was paramount. Why were the oil companies refusing to ask their drivers to go through the picket lines? One view in government circles is that oil company drivers have a lot of sympathy with the hauliers. They do the same job, share the same motorway cafes, and know that many hauliers are close to the financial edge. Some political sources pointed out that the oil companies had little economic stake in preserving the current level of petrol duty. By mid-evening he knew his tour was becoming untenable. The last straw came when he had to pull out of a dinner to celebrate John Prescott's 30 years as a Hull MP: protesters had blocked the routes to the restaurant with their cars. He drove back to the Sheffield Hilton where, in further overnight conversations, it was agreed that he had to return to London. The Education Secretary, David Blunkett, was left to spell out the eerie historical parallels with the Winter of Discontent. He said: \"We are all bound in by our history and we all remember the 'Crisis? What crisis?' of 30 years ago. The Prime Minister needs to be able to sit down, take the necessary advice and to decide what measures need to be taken. We are on the edge of a very real problem. The problem we face is panic buying. We need to ask people to be very calm, not [to] believe we are going to run out of petrol.\" By lunchtime Mr Blair was in Downing Street discussing the crisis with Mr Prescott; the Chief Secretary, Andrew Smith; the police; civil servants; the Industry Secretary, Mr Byers; and Mr Straw. Once again he focused on the companies' refusal to distribute petrol and decided to speak to their chief executives personally. At lunchtime Mr Prescott finally made the government's anger clear. \"We are quite convinced that the oil companies can face up to their responsibilities to see that oil is distributed properly.\" The special powers: \u0095 The Queen has given the government unprecedented powers to assume control of fuel distribution to keep the emergency services going: the cabinet's emergency contingency committee can instruct oil companies to deliver to ambulances, hospitals and schools \u0095 Ministers on the committee are expected to list up to 200 filling stations solely for the emergency services. Police will be in attendance in case of protests \u0095 If necessary the provision can be extended to buses and supermarkets to ensure that food supplies are maintained \u0095 At the Balmoral Privy Council meeting the Queen approved an order in council to set in motion the powers \"because there is imminent in the United Kingdom a threatened emergency affecting fuel supplies which make it necessary in Her Majesty's Opinion that the government should temporarily have at its disposal exceptional powers for controlling the sources and availability of energy\" \u0095 If protesters refuse to let oil tankers leave refineries, the government could fall back on a 1,500-mile network of pipes, normally used to to distribute fuel to military bases, to distribute civilian fuel Nicholas Watt and Michael White",

Tuscany had offered to pay \u00a33,000 for the tests, which Italy's press hailed as a victory. When the samples matched Barnabei's DNA commentators said execution was immoral regardless of guilt or innocence. Jane Barnabei said her son was convicted not just on circumstantial evidence: \"It was evidence that was planted.\" Three Italian legislators met Virginia officials at the weekend and echoed two clemency appeals from Pope John Paul II. Since abolishing the death penalty for civilians in 1948, and for the military in 1994, Italian towns and villages have taken to holding vigils and sponsoring legal action for death-row prisoners abroad. Italy infuriated Turkey last year when it refused to extradite the Kurd rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan because Turkey retained capital punishment. In last Christmas's Urbit et Orbi (\"to the city and the world\") message the Pope called for a ban. Since January the Colosseum, antiquity's temple of blood, has been turned into a worldwide symbol against executions. It is lit up in golden lights every time a death sentence is commuted or a country abolishes capital punishment. In spontaneous comments which drew applause during his weekly public audience at St Peter's Square, the Pope today renewed his clemency plea. He said he was \"again uniting my voice to that of all those who ask that Derek Rocco Barnabei's life not be taken away.\"",

They're British.\" My German friend says it was a moment that changed her whole outlook on a part of life. \"For the first time, I realised you could have a concept of citizenship that was completely separate from the idea of ethnic origin.\" Her anecdote is particularly relevant in the week in which a new commission, headed by the respected Christian Democrat politician, Rita S\u00fcssmuth, starts work on a what promises to be a lengthy review of Germany's laws on nationality and immigration. German, like Britain, has begun to suspect that it needs more, nor less, immigrants for its economic wellbeing. But in Germany, to a far greater extent than in Britain, the issue is bedevilled by the concept of citizenship which my friend had unwittingly carried around with her till the day she went to that office in London. But then it was only last year that a law was introduced by Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's centre-left coalition to break the bond between blood and nationality. It allowed foreigners to become citizens after living in Germany for eight years, provided they gave up their existing passport. Those who had been born in Germany of foreign parents could keep dual citizenship, but were obliged to choose which to keep by the age of 23. By the time it became law, the measure had been watered down in response to bitter resistance, including a petition got up by the opposition Christian Democrats. The new nationality law cost the Social Democrats, the senior partners in the ruling coalition, a defeat in the first regional vote to be held after their general election victory - a result which, in turn, cost them their majority in the regionally appointed upper house. Like my friend, Germans of all classes and persuasions had been conditioned by the fact that, for years, both main parties subscribed to the view that Germany - to use the stock phrase - was \"not a country of immigration\". It was thus neither feasible nor desirable for people to be both black and German. Or to be German and, say, Turkish or Serbian or Italian by origin. Even if you had been born in Germany and spoke accentless German, you could not be a German citizen unless your parents were. Yet the country was, and is, teeming with people of foreign origin. More than seven million of Germany's 82m inhabitants are what, in other countries, would be called immigrants. But not here. One group is made up of the workers from Mediterranean Europe who provided the cheap labour for the \"economic miracle\" and their families. For decades, the politicians sustained the myth that they would one day go home. They were thus not immigrants, but \"Gastarbeiter\" (guest workers). The other group was made up of those who had been accepted since. But they were let in as asylum seekers. The authorities knew full well that most were not genuine political refugees. According to official estimates, only five per cent of those who entered in the early 1990s were fleeing political persecution. But, again, the important thing was to sustain the idea that Germany was \"not a country of immigration\".

But instead of a state - whose due date was delayed for the second time at the weekend - there is the birth of a strange new vocabulary, the creation of those trying to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Their offerings include: divided sovereignty, joint sovereignty, shared sovereignty, delayed sovereignty, suspended sovereignty, functional sovereignty, custodial sovereignty and extraterritorial sovereignty. Because while the battle of sovereignty may seem archaic in an age of globalisation and free trade, this is the Holy Land, where religion, history and sacred sites complicate everything. The newly minted terminology is intended to apply to the Haram al-Sharif, as Muslims call it, or Temple Mount as it is called by the Jews. The site, within the walls of the old city of Jerusalem, is revered equally by Muslims and Jews, and claimed with equal passion by Israelis and Palestinians. The Haram, which contains the shimmering gold Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa mosques, is the third holiest shrine in Islam, after Mecca and Medina. For Jews, it is the most sacred soil on the planet, the site of their temple, which was destroyed in 70 AD except for the Wailing Wall, and is visited by hundreds of worshippers every day. The panoply of definitions, which have come into wide circulation in the last two months, represent attempts by those trying to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to strip the notion of sovereignty of its emotional charge. The logic behind the lexicon is to finesse the present understandings of sovereignty so that both sides can claim victory in the most intractable of their disputes, thus overcoming the single most formidable obstacle to peace in the Middle East. Today, Israeli radio talk shows invented yet another definition: vertical sovereignty. However, that may just be a fancy way of describing subterranean sovereignty. That would see the Palestinians declared the masters of the Haram al-Sharif from the ground up, granting them control of the plateau where the mosques stand, but leaving Israel in control of the ground beneath, where the ruins of the temple are believed to lie. Or humans could simply appeal to the almighty to take the whole dispute off their hands: divine sovereignty. That would grant God title to the Haram, leaving mere mortals with the task of delegating responsibility for such human concerns as policing, rubbish collection, and the issuing of renovation permits for the holy site. The inspiration for such creative solutions to the future dispensation of the Haram has come from some unexpected quarters - the frozen ice cap of Antarctica, a US naval base in the Caribbean, and the secessionist-minded Canadian province of Quebec. At one point, Israeli academics were considering the International Law of the Sea as a possible model for land-locked Jerusalem. The treaty assigns rights to oil, gas and fishing up to 12 miles beyond a country's shoreline - or \"functional sovereignty\". Then there is \"qualified sovereignty\" or \"relative sovereignty\", which describes the extra autonomy enjoyed by the Canadian province of Quebec. Although such ideas are engaging, many Israelis - including the former prime minister and Nobel peace prize laureate, Shimon Peres, has dismissed these efforts are word play. They are seen as far less benign by Palestinians, who accuse Israel of presenting these ideas as fancy formulas to prevent Yasser Arafat from exercising full sovereignty over all areas of East Jerusalem occupied by Israel since 1967. Some of the Israeli proposals would merely sanction the status quo, under which, Israel has exercised ultimate security control over the Haram, while the Palestinians, through the Muslim Waqf, or property trust, are in charge of daily administration. As might have been predicted, the welter of definitions has encouraged imitators, although some are less than earnest. When the idea of God's sovereignty, which was first raised by Jordan in the mid-90s was aired in the Israeli press, some commentators were less than reverential. \"Which God should get sovereignty? The Lord of Hosts, Allah or the father of Jesus?\" asked Zvi Barel, an Arab affairs columnist for Ha'aretz newspaper. \"Maybe the best idea of all would be to transfer sovereignty over the entire Temple Mount compound to the Disney company so it could build a Park of Holies there.\"",

      "bodyText": "For a split second it looked as though a classical education in America was finally being given the respect it deserved. The red carpet at the Staples Centre, home of the LA Lakers basketball champs and venue for last month's Democratic party convention, is being rolled out. CBS is going to broadcast the event live tonight and stars from around the world are flying in for the first Latin Grammar awards. At last, all those who had toiled over their Cicero and their irregular verbs are going to be honoured. On closer inspection, of course, this turns out to be the Latin Grammy awards. Recognising the enormous part that music from Cuba to Brazil and Puerto Rico to East Los Angeles now plays, Latin music is to have its first very own awards ceremony, coming hard on the heels of the Emmy television and the MTV music awards. The event is being organised by the three-year-old Latin Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences - it is always necessary to form an \"academy\" to bring due decorum to an awards ceremony even although no one ever studies at it. Those tipped for awards \"honouring musical excellence by artists performing in Spanish or Portuguese\" include everyone from Ricky Martin and Santana to Ruben Blades and Marc Anthony. But perhaps the choicest potential winner is in the Best New Artists Award: the Cuban star of the Buena Vista Social Club, Ibrahim Ferrer who made the recording for which he is nominated at the sprightly age of 72. At least he's not going to peak too early. Not that you need to be a Latino to win an award: the Latin refers to the genre of the music and not the ethnicity of the performer. But the arrival of the Latin Grammys on the scene could not have come at a more appropriate moment. This month for the first time since it became a state, California has a non-white majority. This historic and much predicted demographic shift has been accomplished mainly as a result of the arrival of immigrants from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and elsewhere in Central America. They now account for 30 per cent of the population of California, 39 per cent in New Mexico and 29 per cent in Texas, which accounts for the fact that George W Bush now sprays his electoral rhetoric with so many \"amigos\" that he sounds like an American car salesman on his first holiday in Acapulco. Ten years ago there were 22m Latinos in the US. Today, there are more than 32m, a 45 per cent increase in a population of 275m. By 2050 it is estimated that there will be nearly 100m, an increase of 197 per cent. Since so many states - Florida, Colorado, Nevada, California, New Mexico, Texas - were originally Mexican, perhaps it is surprising that the shift has taken so long. Anyway, by 2050 the Latin Grammy awards may well have become the mainstream music awards. In the meantime, you can listen to audio clips of the top nominees.",

John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, said the best way for the government to fight its pro-Europe campaign was to set out a vision of a Europe that brought social progress and benefits. \"But, frankly, it does not help us to build a positive case for Europe if the TUC has to keep taking the British government to the European court of justice to win back employment rights which are clearly enshrined in European directives and which are freely accepted elsewhere in Europe,\" he said. \"I would like to see [this] Labour government leading Europe on social improvements, not being the last in a very long convoy expressing arrogant disapproval.\" The TUC is appalled that the government cut the three to four weeks annual holiday guaranteed under EU law to take account of public holidays, and won public backing from Anna Diamantopoulou, the Brussels employment and social affairs commissioner, for its stance.

As our own euro referendum hovers interminably on the horizon, what is happening in Denmark is a guide to what will happen here whenever sterling finally has its date with destiny.</p> <p>Until recently it seemed Pia Kjaersgaard, the Danish People's Party and the no campaign would sweep all before them. Even the European Commission's own polling found (in May this year) a majority of Danes opposed to the single currency: 51%, compared with 40% in favour. This was itself a stiffening of the no vote compared with a similar poll six months earlier which showed the antis with an 8% lead - six months prior to that they were 4% in front. In fact, between January 1996 and January 1998, opposition to the euro in Denmark seldom fell below two-thirds. But since May margins have shifted. A Gallup poll last month suggested a photo finish with 44% of Danes saying they will vote yes to the euro and 43% intending to vote no. Even the 13% of respondents who told Gallup they were undecided seemed determined to take the outcome to the wire, as the proportions of them leaning towards yes or no were almost identical. Another poll put the pros in front. So could it be that what people learn during referendum campaigns is important in determining how they eventually vote - and in the case of the euro this tells in favour of the pros?</p> <p>In September 1997 we experienced our own referendum cliffhanger when Wales voted on whether or not to create a national assembly. Half a dozen polls over the six months prior to the vote sent conflicting messages. In April 1997 one gave a 3% lead to the antis and another in the same month gave an 11% lead to the pros. The next two polls in June and August gave the pros leads of 12% and 22%. In the event, the pros won by a margin of 0.6%, a mere 6,721 votes out of the 1.1m cast.

ICM has been tracking attitudes for several years and in every one of their polls a clear majority have said they would vote no in a referendum. Last month they found 57% opposed, compared with 31% in favour.</p> <p>Yet matters may not be so clear cut. Almost one year before the UK's June 1975 referendum on continued membership of the Common Market, Gallup registered a 17% lead for those who said they would vote to leave. By January 1975, those in favour of leaving still maintained a lead of 8%. Yet subsequent polls reflected a dramatic switch in proposed voting intention towards support for staying in. The switch was not so surprising if we look at the entrails. The same Gallup poll in 1974 that gave a 17% majority for leaving, gave a 30% majority in favour of staying in when people were asked how they would vote if the government negotiated new terms for UK membership and then advised that continued membership was in the UK's interests. By the end of February 1975, Gallup showed the pros with a lead of 8%: by the end of April this had risen to 24%; and by the end of May, Gallup registered a 34% lead among those favouring continued British membership of the Common Market.</p> <p>An poll by NOP for Channel 4 in June suggested the headline figures produced by polls on a British referendum may not, as in 1975, tell the whole story. It put four propositions to respondents. Those who believed we should never join the euro amounted to 23%, compared with 9% who said we should join as soon as possible. But the real battleground in any future referendum campaign will be contested by those who supported the two remaining propositions offered in the survey. Fully 41% agreed that Britain should join the euro \"at some point\" but also that \"the conditions are not yet right\", while 22% signed up to what appears to be the current Tory position that joining \"could cause problems\" and therefore we \"should rule it out for the next few years\". These findings suggest that the result of a referendum could be closer than many expect.</p> <p>In 1975, large numbers of voters were willing to be influenced by the government's assessment of the national interest. Also press, industry and commerce were solidly in favour of continued membership. Above all, the pro campaigners were on the side of the status quo. In a Blair-instigated referendum the electorate might be far less easily swayed by a government endorsement. The press, industry and the City are much more divided than in 1975. And pro campaigners are seeking to overturn the status quo. So can the (seemingly) relentless opposition of the majority to joining the euro be reversed?</p> <p>The answer may turn on the real reason the UK voted as it did in 1975. That referendum was fought amid bitter arguments about the legitimacy of the UK's original membership. Neither then or now has it ever been difficult to find an audience within the UK willing to snarl at \"Europe's\" failings. But 1975 proved something much more important: that however reluctant and resentful we are at being Europeans, the one thing we fear most is being left out in the cold and on our own. Once the Blair government slides off the fence and campaigns for the euro, its success or failure will turn on whether that fear of losing out - of being stranded - is as powerful now as it was 25 years ago.</p> <p>\u0095 David Cowling is a polling expert<br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

If it gets creases out of clothes, that would be one fair indicator. Design, colour, weight, and so on, will affect our choice, but these count for nothing if it doesn't do the job for which it's intended. </p> <p>Social care writing should be judged likewise. If something can be read and understood at the first time of asking, then it's good writing. Simple as that. No matter that it's grammatically correct, well structured and displaying a wide vocabulary: if it's not understood, it's poor writing. </p> <p>And, in this sense, social care is full of poor writing. It is often bloated, pompous and jargon-filled - sometimes so much so that even people who work in social care struggle with its meaning. And if they struggle, what chance do the rest of us have? </p> <p>Why, for example, do inspectors (whose reports are all public documents) come up with \"localised lighting to beds\" for bedside lamps? Or \"hot water outlets\" for taps. Or \"nutritional management\" for food? And they must surely know that phrases such as continuity of care, inter-agency and multi-disciplinary, domiciliary care and self-advocacy are meaningless to the outside world. So why use them? </p> <p>I believe that everybody has a fear of writing. For some, it's an in-your-face fear; for others, it's just a nagging doubt prowling around the back of their minds.

      "bodyText": "Is your writing as transparent as a mixture of comminuted particles of rock with water of varying consistency, or is it just as clear as mud? How do we judge the quality of, say, an iron? If it gets creases out of clothes, that would be one fair indicator. Design, colour, weight, and so on, will affect our choice, but these count for nothing if it doesn't do the job for which it's intended. Social care writing should be judged likewise. If something can be read and understood at the first time of asking, then it's good writing. Simple as that. No matter that it's grammatically correct, well structured and displaying a wide vocabulary: if it's not understood, it's poor writing. And, in this sense, social care is full of poor writing. It is often bloated, pompous and jargon-filled - sometimes so much so that even people who work in social care struggle with its meaning. And if they struggle, what chance do the rest of us have? Why, for example, do inspectors (whose reports are all public documents) come up with \"localised lighting to beds\" for bedside lamps? Or \"hot water outlets\" for taps. Or \"nutritional management\" for food? And they must surely know that phrases such as continuity of care, inter-agency and multi-disciplinary, domiciliary care and self-advocacy are meaningless to the outside world. So why use them? I believe that everybody has a fear of writing. For some, it's an in-your-face fear; for others, it's just a nagging doubt prowling around the back of their minds. I think this fear is there because of the permanency of writing. Say something, and it's gone. Write it down, and it's with us forever, just waiting to come back and haunt or embarrass us. And so we write words we would never say. We would never say, \"Excuse me, may I look at your paper to ascertain what's on TV this evening?\" We'd ask to find out what's on telly.

      "body": "<p>The chandeliered banqueting hall at Newcastle upon Tyne civic centre, commissioned by the city's one-time corrupt council boss T Dan Smith, has become the unlikely setting for protests over plans of the present-day local authority. The protests have been sparked by a regeneration masterplan, known as Going for Growth, which proposes large-scale housing demolition. And the row goes to the heart of the debate over whether Tony Blair's rhetoric of \"community empowerment\" means real power for local people or just talking shops. </p> <p>It is not the idea of regeneration that provokes anger. The protesters talk proudly of the improvements carried out in Newcastle in the 1980s and recognise that more needs to be done. They even accept the need for some demolition. But they are proud, too, of the work they have done to rebuild their own communities after the factory and shipyard closures of the past 20 years. </p> <p>Supported by a growing minority of the governing Labour councillors - including the lord mayor, Peter Thompson - and the Liberal Democrat opposition, the protesters say it is not enough to be consulted over plans they fear are a fait accompli. They are demanding to be involved in the decisions. </p> <p>The neighbourhoods most affected by the plan are to the east and west of the city centre, overlooking the Tyne as it curves round the south of the city. The centre of the controversy in the west end is Scotswood, with its stunning view over the river valley. In the east end it is Walker, next to the trendy walkways and restaurants of the Quayside. In the Going for Growth pack, both Scotswood and Walker are coloured red, as \"unviable\", and the two riverside areas account for most of a total of 6,600 houses targeted for demolition. No other options are proposed. </p> <p>You can feel the anger when you walk the slopes of Scotswood. Banners pour out of recently refurbished houses, declaring: \"We shall not be moved.\" Local meetings have been 800-strong and community activists have presented their own counter proposals to Tony Flynn, leader of the council. But as Gwen Hinde, one of the activists, says: \"He said it was not 'radical' enough in terms of demolition. Everything that is in Going for Growth is what we wanted: schools, transport, jobs. But they have left us, the community, out.\" </p> <p>Radicalism, it appears, is a matter of offering enough of a \"critical mass\" of land to attract private developers. Kevan Jones, the council's cabinet member responsible for development, and a driving force behind the masterplan, admits: \"In the past we've looked at small plots of land, rather than large areas which make it more attractive for developers.\" Private housebuilders have told the plan's consultants that they will not develop land smaller than eight hectares - the size of at least five football pitches - and their house prices are out of reach of most local residents. </p> <p>The story of Newcastle's regeneration is more than community activists versus council bulldozers, however. Two other dramatis personnae need to be introduced: the government-initiated New Deal for communities (NDC) partnership in Cruddas Park and Elswick, also in the inner west end, which is one of 20 or so experiments across the country in \"community-led regeneration\"; and Lord (Richard) Rogers, chair of the commission on urban renaissance, who was brought in by the council to assist its work but now appears uneasy with the direction it is taking. </p> <p>The prime minister explained the thinking behind the NDC when he said: \"Too much has been imposed from above, when experience shows that success depends on the communities themselves having the power and taking responsibility to make things better.\" </p> <p>In the Newcastle NDC, residents of an 8,500-strong neighbourhood, only a mile or so east of Scotswood, have developed their plans \"from below\". A mass meeting chose volunteers to serve, and lead, a partnership with the council, local businesses and public agencies. In November, the interim steering committee will subject itself to street-by-street elections. It has at times been a tense process. \"There have been moments when it looked as if it would fall apart,\" admits Geoff O'Brien, a local Labour councillor. \"But the final plans are very impressive, built around the principle of regeneration with people where they already live.\" </p> <p>This approach is echoed in the way Rogers talks about communities. \"When I walked along the beautiful streets of Scotswood and was told that this must be demolished, my heart filled with questions,\" he says. \"We must build around anything with a flicker of life.\" </p> <p>The council commissioned the Richard Rogers Partnership to work on the west end plan. \"What we did was analyse the city as it is, and examine what is needed for communities to thrive,\" says Rogers. Stressing the independence of his work, he adds: \"The problem is that the council has blurred our draft - very much a draft - plan, with theirs. We have offered no solutions yet. We made no specific proposals for demolition.\" </p> <p>On the importance of involving people from the start in finding solutions to the planning of their neighbourhoods, Rogers says: \"In this kind of situation, it's a matter of life and death. In the 50s and 60s, we took the wrong road. We were centralised. The best you had was consultation. There is a big difference between consultation and participation. With consultation the authority arrives at a plan and asks people: 'Do you like it?.' With participation, you get round the table with community leaders to work on solutions together. \" </p> <p>This approach goes down well with the city-wide Newcastle Community Alliance, founded last month at the meeting in Smith's banqueting hall, and now working with the sustainable cities unit of Northumbria University on alternative approaches. Kenny Bell, an alliance organiser, says: \"Our aim is to get the council to withdraw its proposals for demolition and to make a positive commitment to the participation of the community, based on a genuine sharing of power and co-decision making.\" </p> <p>The council has moved signifi cantly since the alliance was founded. Flynn has given a guarantee that those who wish to stay in their communities can, even if in a different house. The council has also committed itself to look at alternatives drawn up by local people. At the same time, though, Flynn has appeared dismissive of the alliance, saying: \"We need to detach local people from other people with a wider agenda.\" </p> <p>The council leadership now talks at length about consultation: one to one, in groups, any way you suggest. But will they let go of any power? Asked about the NDC way of doing things, Jones seems to suggest he will not. </p> <p>\"The NDC approach is to throw things into the air and see what comes down,\" he says. \"I don't think that is the way forward. The council has got to have its own vision and then make sure that it pulls people in and brings people with it.\" </p> <p>When the council has received all the feedback from its consultations, which close at the end of this month, it will analyse the responses, draw up its final plan and set up \"support teams for areas of major change\". Rogers and his team, meanwhile, are contracted to resume work this autumn and continue through until next March. Rogers is promising to work closely with local people. </p> <p>The council's ruling Labour group is not unknown for faction fighting. A Lib-Dem opposition scenting blood adds to the piquancy. But what is about to happen in Newcastle is likely to have a far wider significance, one that impacts on inner city regeneration everywhere. </p> <p> <strong>Northern lights </strong></p> <p>Some, but not all, northern cities have made a better fist of involving local people in regeneration. Among successful examples is the Royds regeneration of three big estates in Bradford. The key influence there was a real partnership with local people long before the funding bid. </p> <p>Many eyes are now on east Manchester, location of another New Deal for communities project, where consultation awaits a delayed masterplan. A private developer has meanwhile applied to build within the NDC area.</p> <p>Leeds has been successful with modest schemes like Ebor Gardens, reviving social housing near the city centre, but still smarts over the mess the former Urban Development Corporation made in Kirkstall Valley.

When members of the Parachute Regiment disembarked from transport helicopters in Sunday's raid, they found they were waist-deep in swamp water and without cover, exposed to any fire from the rebels holding six British soldiers hostage. Talking about the successful mission yesterday after returning to their base at Connaught Barracks in Dover, they admitted that the rescue unit had expected to be landed on solid ground near the West Side Boys' compound. It was also revealed that at least one senior member of the mission was seriously injured, forcing a rapid reorganisation; and that some of those taking part were as young as 18 and had joined the regiment four days before being chosen for the 150-strong mission force. The revelations illustrate the fine line between military success and failure - and the wider repercussions involved.

Yesterday, however, he announced that the $2.5m (\u00a31.3m) advertising campaign would be withdrawn.</p> <p>Alex Castellanos, the Republican campaigner responsible for producing the advertisment denied trying to send subliminal messages.</p> <p>\"We don't play ball that way. I'm not that clever,\" he said.</p> <p>However, Mr Castellanos has been involved in controversial political broadcasts before. In 1990 he produced an advertisement for the rightwing Republican senator for North Carolina, Jesse Helms, which used racial imagery in a contest with a black businessman, Harvey Gant.

      "bodyText": "The increasingly accident-prone Bush presidential campaign was accused of dirty tricks yesterday, after it was discovered that the word \"rats\" appeared subliminally in a Republican political broadcast targeting Democratic health care proposals. The offending word, in large white capital letters, flashes against a black background for a thirtieth of a second as a woman narrator criticises Vice President Al Gore's plan for government funding of prescriptions for pensioners. George W Bush ridiculed as \"bizarre and weird\" accusations that his campaign was trying to use such underhand techniques to discredit his opponent. Yesterday, however, he announced that the $2.5m (\u00a31.3m) advertising campaign would be withdrawn. Alex Castellanos, the Republican campaigner responsible for producing the advertisment denied trying to send subliminal messages. \"We don't play ball that way. I'm not that clever,\" he said. However, Mr Castellanos has been involved in controversial political broadcasts before. In 1990 he produced an advertisement for the rightwing Republican senator for North Carolina, Jesse Helms, which used racial imagery in a contest with a black businessman, Harvey Gant. At one point a white pair of hands receives a job rejection letter and crumples it up, but for a fraction of a second the letter fades to a picture of Mr Gant and the hands appear to be crushing his head. Kathleen Hall Jamieson, who analyses the advertisement in her book Dirty Politics: Deception, Distraction and Democracy, said Mr Castellanos insisted then that the imagery was accidental. Ms Jamieson believes the Helms advertisement was the first instance of subliminal imagery in US political advertising and Mr Castellanos's \"rats advertisement\" is the second. Gore campaign workers were scarcely able to contain their glee yesterday as the Bush campaign was forced into emergency damage limitation for the second time in eight days, at a time when it is losing ground in the polls. Last Monday - apparently unaware that he was speaking close to a live microphone - Mr Bush was overheard describing a New York Times reporter as \"a major-league asshole\". The reporter, Adam Clymer, had written a critical account of the Texas governor's record on health care, and the gaffe made Mr Bush appear peevish and unsettled. Campaigning in Florida yesterday, the candidate seemed rattled by the new controversy yesterday, struggling to pronounce the word \"subliminal\", and raising doubts as to whether he understood its meaning when he argued: \"The idea of one frame out of 900 hardly in my judgment makes a conspiracy.\" After seeing a double-digit lead in the polls evaporate in less than a month, splits have emerged in the Bush camp over how to pursue the campaign, and when to \"go negative\". Last week the candidate's staff were trying to increase their control over the Republican National Committee's campaign office responsible for producing political broadcasts, because it was unhappy about the harshly negative tone of some of its output. Mr Castellanos insisted that the word had appeared accidentally as part of a visual effect which broke up words from campaign slogans into fragments and flashed them across the screen. The word \"rats\" was supposed to be part of \"bureaucrats\", he said. In the controversial segment of the advertisement, other words and groups of letters appear before the slogan \"The Gore Prescription Plan: Bureaucrats Decide\" crystallises on the screen. However, the word \"rats\" is larger than the other word-fragments. The word was spotted only after 4,400 screenings in 33 regions, by a Democratic supporter in Seattle, Gary Greenup, who alerted his local party. \"Initially, I was just kind of intrigued... but when I taped it and looked it I thought this is not really very good. It's somewhat underhand and a little bit devious and it should be brought to light.\"",

      "bodyText": "The government has agreed to give the public some form of access to details of sex offenders, the parents of the murdered eight-year-old schoolgirl Sarah Payne said yesterday. Emerging after an hour-long meeting with the Home Office minister Paul Boateng, Michael and Sara Payne said he had agreed to their request for a version of a \"Sarah's law\", giving parents access to the sex offenders register. Outside the Home Office headquarters in central London, Mrs Payne said: \"We have been assured there will be a Sarah's law. We are very happy indeed. It's what we were all working so hard for. Unfortunately we haven't got our daughter, but it might help somebody else's.\" Mr and Mrs Payne refused to give further details of assurances made by Mr Boateng. A Home Office spokeswoman said: \"There were constructive discussions between Mr Boateng and the family of Sarah Payne. The proposed direction of government policy was part of those discussions. We expect to make an announcement shortly.\" She refused to give further details of what had been agreed or to confirm claims that Mr Boateng had promised to introduce a Sarah's law. Ministers have been looking at ways to strengthen police powers to deal with paedophiles, expected to be announced this month. These could allow police to photograph and question offenders on the register, and possibly authorise police to enter and search their homes. But the plans had been expected to stop short of a Sarah's law - based on the US Megan's law, named for a schoolgirl killed by a paedophile in California in 1994 - making the names and addresses of sex offenders public. Access to the information varies from state to state. In some states, names and pictures can be downloaded from a police website. There has been scepticism over how effective Megan's law has been in stopping offenders repeating their crimes. The law has also been undermined by vigilante attacks. In Britain only the police and certain other officials have access to the sex offenders' register. It has a higher compliance rate of offenders keeping it updated than US equivalents. The former Tory home secretary, Michael Howard, said he had considered a British version of Megan's law in 1997 when the sex offences register was launched, but rejected the idea after advisers warned him of the dangers of paedophiles going to ground. Lawyers have warned that the move could be challenged as a breach of the right to privacy guaranteed by the European convention on human rights. The Paynes were whisked off in a Jaguar with the News of the World's editor, Rebekah Wade, and managing editor Stuart Kuttner, who also attended the meeting. The paper has been campaigning for the introduction of a Sarah's law. This included \"naming and shaming\" people on the sex offenders register by publishing their details, a move thought to have led to vigilante attacks on innocent people. Before the meeting, the Paynes handed the home secretary, Jack Straw, a 700,000-name petition calling for a Sarah's law, mainly from News of the World readers. The couple, from Hersham, Surrey, said Mr Straw agreed to the need for tougher sentencing and more powers for families of victims. Mr Payne said the massive public support for their campaign since their daughter was snatched on July 1 from a country lane near her grandparents' home in Kingston, West Sussex, had helped them cope with her death.",

This word will be used to verify any contact with the letter writer, and coding experts are examining whether it was generated by the Enigma machine. The demand was authenticated by a photocopy of the machine's serial number, G312. The letter was addressed to Christine Large, director of the charitable Bletchley Park trust, which now runs the wartime code-breaking centre near Milton Keynes as a museum. She received it last Wednesday. It had been posted in the Midlands the day before and written on an old-fashioned typewriter, fuelling speculation the author was a professional collector. Police guaranteed yesterday that, if there was no wrongdoing, the Enigma's new owner would not face prosecution and would remain anonymous.

Mrs Large said she was prepared to do whatever was necessary to regain the machine for the public. While there are a number of \"three rotor\" Enigma machines on the collectors' market, the one stolen, which was on loan from the intelligence-gathering centre GCHQ, is particularly rare: it has four rotors, producing a more advanced form of the Enigma code.

The trust has accepted an offer from a private collector of intelligence memorabilia to place an original four-wheel Enigma machine similar to the one stolen on long-term display at Bletchley Park. Military historians believe that without the code breaking activities of staff at there, codenamed Station X, the war would have lasted two years longer.

      "bodyText": "The upstairs, downstairs domestic lifestyle may be long gone, but Britons still spend more than \u00a39bn a year on help in the home, a report revealed yesterday. Full-time servants are a thing of the past for most families, but more than 2.7m households now regularly employ some sort of domestic help. The report, 21st Century Housekeeping, shows that each household employing domestic help spends an average of \u00a33,493 a year on it, equivalent to \u00a373 a week, on everything from gardeners to nannies. The rate of pay for employing a cleaner is about \u00a34.85 an hour, while a gardener earns a typical hourly rate of \u00a36.46. Yet nannies and child carers who have a bigger responsibility are earning much less - being paid just \u00a33.64 an hour. The research shows that nine in 10 people who work as hired helps are paid cash in hand, while two in three \"domestic bosses\" have never discussed a pay review with their employees. Surprisingly, almost half of homeowners say they rarely see their hired help, while a similar amount of home helps failed to set out terms and conditions before they started the job. Nine in 10 employers say they have not considered the insurance ramifications of hiring extra help in the home. The report said: \"Times have changed since the days when live-in servants were only for the aristocracy and leisured classes. \"Taking on hired help in the home is commonplace for ordinary working families up and down the country and, in many cases, is becoming essential rather than a luxury.\" The report, by the insurance company Norwich Union, said the number of working women and mothers, today's long hours culture and the desire for more leisure time have all led to an increasing number of families taking on domestic help. It said that 2.75m British households employ domestic help for, on average, 13.14 hours a week at an average wage of \u00a35.54 an hour. \"Based on a 48-week working year, that means as a nation we are spending \u00a39bn on hired help,\" the report claimed. Norwich Union commissioned research among 1,000 households across Britain, as well as 500 employers and 500 employees. Specialist News Services",

Church leaders privately acknowledged the move would not have been adopted but for accusations that the Catholic authorities attempted to cover up abuse by Father Michael Hill, released from prison last week after serving three and a half years of a five year sentence. Revelations that Hill was removed from his parish but allowed to continue his ministry by his former bishop, Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, now Archbishop of Westminster and de-facto leader of the Church in England and Wales, came close to swamping the church this summer. The archbishop admitted yesterday that the story had been highly damaging to him personally. The church's defensive response has caused not only external criticisms and calls for Archbishop Murphy-O'Connor's resignation but also the voicing of concerns with the archbishop by senior lay Catholics. The church disclosed that 21 priests, out of 5,600, have been convicted of offences against children in the last five years, though more cases are pending. The number of prosecutions is currently running at about four a year. Yesterday the archbishop issued his most fulsome act of contrition yet for the scandal, saying: \"I wish to apologise sincerely to the survivors of abuse and their families and communities...they have been hurt not just by the abusers but also by mistaken attitudes within the church community at all levels. \"I acknowledge that far too often there has been insensitivity and inadequate response to their hurt. The errors of the past must not be repeated.\" A committee of nine senior figures - only four of them, including Lord Nolan, Catholic - will review the arrangements the church has already put in place for child protection and is due to report back by next Easter. A code of conduct was adopted by the church in 1994. Among the members is Sir Swinton Thomas, a retired justice of appeal, Gill Mackenzie, chief probation officer of Gloucestershire who chairs the association of chief probation officers and David Veness, assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police. But Lord Nolan admitted that the committee would not investigate or comment on individual cases and that it had not been given a \"blank cheque\" to rewrite church procedures or any assurance that its recommendations would eventually be adopted. He said: \"There is no question of this being an in-house review. It should be seen as an independent body with a broad range of expertise in the area of protecting children.\" One of the members of the committee, the Rt. Rev.

[laughs uproariously] Me? Oh, you know, the usual - East Enders, Corrie... Yeah, I watch Big Brother from time to time. Can't say I like any of them, to be honest [laughs uproariously again]. Steve Williamson, 29: \"Nah, I really don't watch much TV. I used to like Harry Enfield, but he's gone to Sky now and I'm too much of a cheapskate to pay for it. Nah, other than that, I can't be bothered.\" Michelle Williamson, 22: \"I don't get a chance to watch as much as I used to when I was at college - then it was Neighbours twice a day, all the soaps, whatever really... These days I'm lucky if I catch the EastEnders omnibus. I still try and keep up with Neighbours, but I never know who's who and what's going on anymore. It's a shame.\" Anthony Barker, 33: \"Yeah, it's Big Brother for me. I only really got into it when all that Nasty Nick business kicked off - he's a character, isn't he? Yeah, I think it went downhill a bit after that actually, but I was hooked by then. Now I just hope Craig wins. [does Scouse accent] Eh! Eh! [goes back to usual accent] Nah, he's great.

Twenty years ago he and the rest of the Specials were woken by a phone call to their hotel in America and told that Too Much Too Young had made number one in the UK singles charts. \"We just turned over and went back to sleep,\" recalls Roddy, now 45, who has reverted to his original surname of Byers. </p> <p>Byers and the other band members still remember the exhaustion of that endless tour around the States with other groups who recorded on the 2-Tone label, such as Madness and the Selecter. Since forming as the Special AKA in 1977, they had hardly stopped to breathe, and the strain was taking its toll. \"We were on the road for five months, putting in high-energy performances at night and travelling huge distances by day in a mobile padded cell,\" says bass player Horace Panter. \"It destroyed us for a while.\" </p> <p>And there had been too much fighting in the dance halls back home. \"Because we were black and white musicians playing together, we were targeted by racists, Sieg Heiling and throwing coins at us,\" says Byers. \"There were so many people trying to get at us that the temporary stages were in danger of collapsing. I remember a great split opening up in one place.\" </p> <p>By the summer of 1981 the Specials had also split, almost immediately after hitting the number-one slot again. Their haunting masterpiece Ghost Town, sung by the black Neville Staples and the white Terry Hall, was written by Jerry Dammers, the iconoclastic son of the Dean of Bristol Cathedral. Rarely can a single so brilliantly have caught the mood of the times. Brixton and Toxteth were ablaze. Copycat disturbances were going on in run-down estates across the land. And Thatcherism was wreaking havoc in the manufacturing heart of England. </p> <p>In the years to come there would be endless 2-Tone revivals and cross-fertilisations between one band and another. But nothing could quite match the intensity of the brand of ska music that Dammers forged from seven very disparate musicians and singers. For a brief moment this blend of punk and reggae had even made Coventry the centre of British pop. </p> <p>Now the city's Belgrade Theatre is staging Three-Minute Heroes, a new musical play set in the turbulent three years between 1979 and 1981. The writer, the Belgrade's artistic director, Bob Eaton, has chosen to focus his story on a fictional 2-Tone band who never make it into the charts but worship the Specials and the Selecter from afar. Woven into the plot are real-life incidents, like the benefit gig for the family of Statnam Gill, one of two Asians in the city who were murdered by skinheads in 1981. There's also a reference to the march organised by the Anti-Nazi League and the Indian Workers' Association. This brought thousands of Coventry people on to the streets in protest at the thuggery being perpetrated in their midst by people seeking scapegoats for the motor city's first major dose of mass unemployment in the 20th century. </p> <p>Not exactly a happy-go-lucky musical, then, but it has its lighter moments. \"And at least it has a coherent script,\" says Selecter singer Pauline Black, who made one or two suggestions that Eaton has taken on board. She'll be at the Belgrade for tomorrow's first night, as will Roddy Byers. Black has had first-hand experience of television drama and the London stage - her portrayal of the jazz singer Billie Holiday won her the Time Out award for best actress in 1990. But since the Selecter were reborn in 1994, she has enjoyed being back on the road. A much easier road, she admits, than it was during the band's first incarnation. \"An old skinhead came up to me after one of our gigs recently and apologised for the behaviour of his mates at the Hammersmith Palais 20 years ago,\" she muses. \"I think the first 10 rows were either gobbing or screaming Sieg Heil.\" </p> <p>The Selecter's original songwriter and lead guitarist, Neol Davies, remembers being \"outraged\" on behalf of his fellow performers and sickened when he heard that his black friend, Lynval Golding of the Specials, had been beaten up by skinheads outside London's Moonlight Club in 1980. \"The anti-racist stance that 2-Tone took was very important to me,\" says Davies, whose six fellow band members were all black. \"Neol was our token white,\" grins Black. </p> <p>Like the Specials, the Selecter were a mixture of former students and those who had grown up in Coventry. Davies was a local boy, brought up with neighbours who were Irish, Polish, Ukranian, Indian and West Indian. When we meet, he and Panter have just finished a set for the blues section of the Coventry jazz festival. Two years ago, they got together with Anthony Harty, formerly of the Style Council. Their band, Box of Blues, has been well received on the circuit, but they are still struggling to find a distributor for their maiden CD. </p> <p>The original Selecter split in 1982, one year after the Specials, having formed in the same year - 1977. Not long afterwards, fellow Coventrian Pete Waterman began using his production skills to turn \"artists\" with a fraction of the creativity of Dammers or Davies into stars and himself into a multi-millionaire. Waterman's former Coventry record shop, the Soul Hole, gets a mention in Eaton's play because he was part of the local scene in those days. </p> <p>Roddy Byers remembers being woken one morning in 1977 or 1978 by Dammers and Waterman. \"We're going to London to make a demo tape,\" they told him, and he was bundled, bleary-eyed, into the van. \"We did a song called Dawn of a New Era in some place in Berwick Street,\" recalls Byers. \"But nothing came of it - and we didn't get paid either.\" </p> <p>It was another occasion when Roddy Radiation wished he could have carried on sleeping. Little did he know that the dawn of 2-Tone was only a short time away. Two bands from Coventry would scatter a few rays of light during a dark period of British history. When they finally got out of bed, they were prepared to stand up and be counted against orchestrated racism. As Eaton says: \"What better riposte to the crap put out at that time by the National Front and the British Movement than to see black and white young people bouncing around the stage together?\" </p> <p>\u0095 Three-Minute Heroes is at the Belgrade, Coventry (024-7655 3055), till September 30.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There were three boyhood heroes I always wanted to interview. Georgie Best and Raymond Carver I met in the late 80s. Kevin Rowland was the last, and I finally ran up against him last year. The occasion was the release of his long-awaited comeback album (the marvellously over-ambitious My Beauty). The location was a restaurant by the Thames. For reasons he never got round to explaining, Kevin required the proximity of a river to talk. Only we were not close enough to the water for his liking. For Kevin to be inspired, we needed to get closer. </p> <p>All well and good. Except for the fact that between us and the river stands a 25-foot concrete bank. And there's no easy way down. After some deep contemplation, Kevin suggests, half-jokingly, that we take a run at it. Well, why not? If your boyhood hero suggests you take a running jump at a steep concrete slope, you do it without thinking. Even if you're decked out in your favourite Hugo Boss suit. </p> <p>The jump is spectacularly un- successful. Halfway down the slope I lose my balance and fall tit over teakettle. It's a bumpy ride down and, at the bottom, my forehead cracks against jagged rock. En route, my \u00a3800 suit is ripped to shreds and splattered with mud. As if this wasn't enough, the entire calamity has been witnessed by the clientele of the restaurant who, as one, stand and applaud, as if this was the funniest thing that had ever happened in the entire history of the civilised world. </p> <p>So there I stand, best suit ruined, blood pouring from all manner of places, a bruise on my head the size of a Jaffa orange, having the rise taken out of me by a crowd of Sunday afternoon revellers. It doesn't get much more undignified. But, hell, why worry? It's not every day you get to spend the day with Kevin Rowland, listen to his rollercoaster life story and be reminded at every turn why he was always a man to believe in. </p> <p>If you ever believed in Kevin Rowland and Dexy's Midnight Runners, you did so with a passion. The kind of passion that is probably considered terribly old-fashioned these days, when cool detachment, combined with withering cynicism, is deemed to be the most dignified stance. </p> <p>Dexy's hit the ground running in 1979. Their impact was fierce, intense and brutally immediate. The music, the image, the attitude - it was all there, as though they'd come out of the womb fully formed. They seemed to possess the intellectual weight of Bob Dylan, the artistic purity of Van Morrison, the revolutionary spirit of The Clash and the soulfulness of the best Stax music. They were, it has to be said, one hell of a band. </p> <p>In many ways the musical landscape of the early 80s resembled the dry season of the early 60s, the drab bit between the Big Bang of Little Richard and the arrival of the Beatles. Back in 1980, with punk having come and gone, it was virtually a straight choice between the suicidal gloom of Joy Division and the frills and fancies of the New Romantics. No choice at all, really. </p> <p>Then Dexy's came swaggering in, shaking things up, and they really were something to believe in. They were smash-and-grab artists, profound misfits, wild-hearted outsiders to a man. Kevin Rowland was the most wild-hearted of them all. Intense emotion, that was his thing, and highly infectious it was too. At a time of post-punk conformity, when playing it safe and preening with ironic detachment was the order of the day, Dexy's did things differently. </p> <p>Pronouncing rock'n'roll dead, they dressed like New York dockers in worn donkey jackets and woolly hats - the first of many bewildering image changes. Next up, there were the ponytails, hooded sweatshirts and brawler's boots that made them look like members of a shady Sicilian boxing club. After that came the Too-Rye-Ay look: denim dungarees, Romany threads, soul-searching expressions. Then, to accompany their Don't Stand Me Down album, clean-cut Ivy League clobber. </p> <p>As Rowland explains in tonight's near-perfect BBC2 documentary on the band, Don't Stand Me Down was intended to be his magnum opus, his ultimate statement of soulful intent. And so it proved. It also turned out to be a dramatic commercial failure and hastened the band's demise, followed by Rowland's hectic descent into a cold, soundless abyss of poverty, drug-addiction and depression. </p> <p>What kind of mark did Dexy's leave in the sand? Well, quite simply, a collection of songs that continue to amaze and inspire to this day. From the fervid call-to-arms that was 1980's Searching For The Young Soul Rebels, through the deep-thinking Celtic swing of 1982's Too-Rye-Ay, to the sprawling genius that was 1985's Don't Stand Me Down, Dexy's aimed to outperform themselves every time. In those five years, they produced a body of work that - in its random brilliance - stands fair comparison with the Fab Four's 1965-1969 period. </p> <p>During tonight's documentary, Dexy's Kevin \"Al\" Archer is asked whether, 15 years on, he still believes in Kevin Rowland's self-styled soul vision. \"Of course I still believe in it,\" he says with cast-iron certainty. \"I believe that Dexy's were easily the best group of the 80s.\" </p> <p>Ultimately, I suppose, Dexy's were one of those bands that you either got or you didn't. And those who did get it... well, they believed in it with the charged intensity and thrilling certainty of a rash moment, followed by a steep fall and the sharp crack of bone against rock. </p> <p>\u0095 Young Guns Go For It, tonight, BBC2, 9.50pm</p>",

They seemed to possess the intellectual weight of Bob Dylan, the artistic purity of Van Morrison, the revolutionary spirit of The Clash and the soulfulness of the best Stax music. They were, it has to be said, one hell of a band. In many ways the musical landscape of the early 80s resembled the dry season of the early 60s, the drab bit between the Big Bang of Little Richard and the arrival of the Beatles. Back in 1980, with punk having come and gone, it was virtually a straight choice between the suicidal gloom of Joy Division and the frills and fancies of the New Romantics. No choice at all, really. Then Dexy's came swaggering in, shaking things up, and they really were something to believe in. They were smash-and-grab artists, profound misfits, wild-hearted outsiders to a man. Kevin Rowland was the most wild-hearted of them all. Intense emotion, that was his thing, and highly infectious it was too. At a time of post-punk conformity, when playing it safe and preening with ironic detachment was the order of the day, Dexy's did things differently. Pronouncing rock'n'roll dead, they dressed like New York dockers in worn donkey jackets and woolly hats - the first of many bewildering image changes. Next up, there were the ponytails, hooded sweatshirts and brawler's boots that made them look like members of a shady Sicilian boxing club. After that came the Too-Rye-Ay look: denim dungarees, Romany threads, soul-searching expressions. Then, to accompany their Don't Stand Me Down album, clean-cut Ivy League clobber. As Rowland explains in tonight's near-perfect BBC2 documentary on the band, Don't Stand Me Down was intended to be his magnum opus, his ultimate statement of soulful intent. And so it proved. It also turned out to be a dramatic commercial failure and hastened the band's demise, followed by Rowland's hectic descent into a cold, soundless abyss of poverty, drug-addiction and depression. What kind of mark did Dexy's leave in the sand? Well, quite simply, a collection of songs that continue to amaze and inspire to this day. From the fervid call-to-arms that was 1980's Searching For The Young Soul Rebels, through the deep-thinking Celtic swing of 1982's Too-Rye-Ay, to the sprawling genius that was 1985's Don't Stand Me Down, Dexy's aimed to outperform themselves every time. In those five years, they produced a body of work that - in its random brilliance - stands fair comparison with the Fab Four's 1965-1969 period. During tonight's documentary, Dexy's Kevin \"Al\" Archer is asked whether, 15 years on, he still believes in Kevin Rowland's self-styled soul vision. \"Of course I still believe in it,\" he says with cast-iron certainty. \"I believe that Dexy's were easily the best group of the 80s.\" Ultimately, I suppose, Dexy's were one of those bands that you either got or you didn't. And those who did get it... well, they believed in it with the charged intensity and thrilling certainty of a rash moment, followed by a steep fall and the sharp crack of bone against rock. \u0095 Young Guns Go For It, tonight, BBC2, 9.50pm",

Logan played in All The King's Men alongside David Jason who was, of course, Del to Nicholas Lyndhurst's Rodney in Only Fools And Horses.

Five re-releases of old Harry Nilsson records - what could be more marginal than that? In fact, you have to marvel at just how marginal Nilsson managed to make himself, despite recording one of the best-selling cover versions of its day. </p> <p>One thing I remember fondly about him is that his 1971 LP Nilsson Schmilsson had an unbelievably boring sleeve, which I can only interpret as an act of provocation on his part, considering what a brazen, lush record it was. On the front was a muddy grey photo of the artist in an old bathrobe clutching a pipe, looking unlikely to sing a note before his hangover cleared; the back featured his fridge. I also remember a strange BBC2 solo show in which multiple Nilssons sang barbershop harmonies, juggled, shared the screen with performing gorillas, and bored a studio audience to sleep. </p> <p>Nilsson has gone down in history as a nearly-was: an accomplished, much-covered songwriter who had his own biggest hits with other people's material. He was on the soundtrack of Midnight Cowboy singing the Fred Neil song Everybody's Talking; his own I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City was turned down. His biggest hit, the Wagnerian angst-storm Without You, was originally by Beatles acolytes Badfinger. </p> <p>Nilsson also had a self-destructive streak: just when Without You and Nilsson Schmilsson had made him a favourite with impressionable teens and sentimental parents alike, he alienated them all with a facetious follow-up, Son of Schmilsson, on which he roped in a chorus of senior citizens from Stepney and Pinner to sing a questionable ditty about ageing (\"I'd rather be dead/Than wet my bed\"). He went downhill from there, partly as a result of Famous Friends Syndrome (too much joking around with Ringo Starr, too many benders with John Lennon). The story ends in 1994 with his death after diabetes and heart problems. There was a brief, last-minute injection of hipness: his cod-Caribbean ramble Coconut featured incongruously in Reservoir Dogs. </p> <p>Nilsson's output zigzagged every which way, from glutinous schmaltz to vituperatively aggressive brilliance, via excruciating lapses into whimsy. Some of the great stuff is on his 1967 debut Pandemonium Shadow Show. It is patchy and larded with the baroque production excesses of the time, but it does contain several extraordinary songs, including Without Her, one of the most depressive lost-love ballads in the book. There's the deceptively bouncy circular narrative: boy is born, father walks out, boy grows up to join circus, it all goes wrong, he settles down, has a son, then he walks out, leading to the punchline, \"But what will happen to the boy when circus comes to town?\" </p> <p>You might be inclined to write off Nilsson Schmilsson if you've seen it filed alongside your auntie's Mantovani. However, not only does it have Without You but Nilsson's bizarrely elastic voice does unnerving things with seemingly incompatible genres, from studiedly soporific blues to the frenzied hard-rock mantra of Jump Into the Fire. There's passion, humour and a hint of personality breakdown, the sense of a larynx raging after years of soft-pop frustration. It is a great vocal showcase and a marvel of incongruity - a commercial album that refuses to limit itself to any one market. </p> <p>It's astonishing Nilsson was ever able to put these records out at all. There's no sense of any coherent career plan - one minute he's a family entertainer, the next seedy farceur or lugubrious balladeer. It could only have happened when it was possible for an artist to play one genre against another, sneaking under the wire from cosy MOR entertainment to rock and back again. Nilsson's records are anachronisms from a brief time when genre distinctions were strangely fluid.

      "body": "<p>Every night in the city of Prague, up to 170 passengers squeeze on to a converted barge named the Secret. Crew members take them through an aeroplane-style safety drill, complete with life-vests and polystyrene floats, as the boat sets off along the Vltava river, accompanied by a Hungarian Gypsy band. The light fades; gnats dance in the boat's headlights. </p> <p>This is not the Czech answer to the bteau-mouche, but rather the latest venture by Petr and Matej Forman, the identical twin sons of film director Milos Foreman. Petr calls it the Czech Millennium Dome. The pair have ploughed almost \u00a3130,000 of their own cash into this floating theatre with its all-singing, all-dancing puppet play, Secrets of the Crimson Sails - and so far they are losing money. </p> <p>As the boat slides past the trams, the cubist villas and the soaring TV tower, a complex production unravels on the revolving stage: human actors cavort as floppy drunks, virtually indistinguishable from the life-size puppets with which they share the limelight; toy boats zoom over the audience's heads; merchants appear on stilts, unravelling multi-coloured silks that envelop the stage; and then, most enchanting of all, the stained-glass table tops in the stalls light up to reveal tiny doll's house-size scenes. </p> <p>Written by the Russian storyteller Alexander Grin, this is the tale of Assol, a poor sailor's daughter convinced that one day a handsome prince will whisk her away on a ship with crimson sails. \"It's about the fact that real life can also be like a fairytale, and that people can make miracles happen for others,\" says Petr. He and Matej say that after this project they know all about miracle-making. \"Everyone said the project was mad from the outset,\" says Petr. \"Even our dad said we'd bitten off more than we could chew.\" </p> <p>The tale of the show's tortuous birth encompasses all the nightmares one might expect to face in a bureaucratic, cash-strapped and land-locked country. When the brothers came across an old communist-era barge rusting in a boat yard last year, they approached the ministry of transport with plans to turn it into a theatre boat, only to be confronted with unending lists of conditions. Now they are convinced they know enough about boats to qualify as waterways engineers. </p> <p>Next came attempts to convince the culture ministry that the project was worth supporting. They had a chance to get their hands on extra cash because of Prague's status as a European City of Culture - but only if they could fight their way through Kafkaesque bureaucracy. </p> <p>Carpenters, construction workers and craftspeople worked for months on the conversion, earning as little as 300 crowns (\u00a35.50) a day. Once the boat was completed, the 22-strong team had become so involved the Formans couldn't bear to let them go. \"They were an integral part of it, so we employed all of them as actors,\" says Petr. Apart from the twins, there are only three professional actors involved. </p> <p>Petr and Matej attribute their remarkable achievement to the fact that they are twins. \"We've got something that many people try and fail to find all their lives,\" says Petr. \"I trust my brother 100% and we have a natural communication that helps the creative process and enables us to do crazy things.\" Indeed, so united are their thought processes that they initially insist that there's no point in my speaking to both of them. </p> <p>The brothers, who live on separate floors of the same Prague house, bought for them by their father, stress that they are not alone in their latest venture. They are co-operating with the French cabaret theatre Dromesko and the Theatre National de Bretagne. After Prague, they plan to visit Hamburg, Dresden, Strasbourg, Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Nancy. And they are keen to find backers in London to help them negotiate the Thames. </p> <p>Animation and skilful puppetry are traditions strongly associated with Bohemia. Under the Hapsburg empire, the Czech language was squeezed off the mainstream stage in favour of German, but was allowed to survive in puppet theatre. Under communism, the authorities considered puppetry mere child's play, so it was allowed to thrive almost unsupervised, giving directors the freedom to create some fascinating subversive productions. </p> <p>Petr Forman graduated from Prague's puppet school in 1987, and Matej studied as an animation illustrator at the academy of fine arts. They started out as film actors, using their father's name to promote their double act. But after their first puppet show, for which they built a portable barn, they became popular in their own right. </p> <p>Born in 1964, the twins were the product of Milos Forman's second marriage, to Vera Kresadlova. Four years later, their father left Czechoslovakia for the US. Now he is hovering proudly in the background. \"He came to see the boat a month before the premiere,\" says Petr. \"He was at the Berlin film festival catching the Golden Bear award for The Man on the Moon, and he rented a car to pop over the border, sleeping in our caravan on the river's edge.\" Since then he has telephoned every day. </p> <p>Despite their father's financial and moral support, and the fact that Crimson Sails is playing to a packed boat every night, the money is running out. Each performance loses them around 65,000 crowns (\u00a31,200), and the musicians have to be paid from the proceeds of the boat's bar. \"We'll soon have to go begging to the ministry again,\" they say in unison. But then, pointing to a scale model of the Titanic on top of the bar, they manage a joke: \"Although the boat is sinking, we're still dancing.\"</p>",

Crew members take them through an aeroplane-style safety drill, complete with life-vests and polystyrene floats, as the boat sets off along the Vltava river, accompanied by a Hungarian Gypsy band. The light fades; gnats dance in the boat's headlights. This is not the Czech answer to the bteau-mouche, but rather the latest venture by Petr and Matej Forman, the identical twin sons of film director Milos Foreman. Petr calls it the Czech Millennium Dome. The pair have ploughed almost \u00a3130,000 of their own cash into this floating theatre with its all-singing, all-dancing puppet play, Secrets of the Crimson Sails - and so far they are losing money. As the boat slides past the trams, the cubist villas and the soaring TV tower, a complex production unravels on the revolving stage: human actors cavort as floppy drunks, virtually indistinguishable from the life-size puppets with which they share the limelight; toy boats zoom over the audience's heads; merchants appear on stilts, unravelling multi-coloured silks that envelop the stage; and then, most enchanting of all, the stained-glass table tops in the stalls light up to reveal tiny doll's house-size scenes. Written by the Russian storyteller Alexander Grin, this is the tale of Assol, a poor sailor's daughter convinced that one day a handsome prince will whisk her away on a ship with crimson sails. \"It's about the fact that real life can also be like a fairytale, and that people can make miracles happen for others,\" says Petr. He and Matej say that after this project they know all about miracle-making. \"Everyone said the project was mad from the outset,\" says Petr. \"Even our dad said we'd bitten off more than we could chew.\" The tale of the show's tortuous birth encompasses all the nightmares one might expect to face in a bureaucratic, cash-strapped and land-locked country. When the brothers came across an old communist-era barge rusting in a boat yard last year, they approached the ministry of transport with plans to turn it into a theatre boat, only to be confronted with unending lists of conditions. Now they are convinced they know enough about boats to qualify as waterways engineers. Next came attempts to convince the culture ministry that the project was worth supporting. They had a chance to get their hands on extra cash because of Prague's status as a European City of Culture - but only if they could fight their way through Kafkaesque bureaucracy. Carpenters, construction workers and craftspeople worked for months on the conversion, earning as little as 300 crowns (\u00a35.50) a day. Once the boat was completed, the 22-strong team had become so involved the Formans couldn't bear to let them go. \"They were an integral part of it, so we employed all of them as actors,\" says Petr. Apart from the twins, there are only three professional actors involved. Petr and Matej attribute their remarkable achievement to the fact that they are twins. \"We've got something that many people try and fail to find all their lives,\" says Petr. \"I trust my brother 100% and we have a natural communication that helps the creative process and enables us to do crazy things.\" Indeed, so united are their thought processes that they initially insist that there's no point in my speaking to both of them. The brothers, who live on separate floors of the same Prague house, bought for them by their father, stress that they are not alone in their latest venture. They are co-operating with the French cabaret theatre Dromesko and the Theatre National de Bretagne. After Prague, they plan to visit Hamburg, Dresden, Strasbourg, Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Nancy. And they are keen to find backers in London to help them negotiate the Thames. Animation and skilful puppetry are traditions strongly associated with Bohemia. Under the Hapsburg empire, the Czech language was squeezed off the mainstream stage in favour of German, but was allowed to survive in puppet theatre. Under communism, the authorities considered puppetry mere child's play, so it was allowed to thrive almost unsupervised, giving directors the freedom to create some fascinating subversive productions. Petr Forman graduated from Prague's puppet school in 1987, and Matej studied as an animation illustrator at the academy of fine arts. They started out as film actors, using their father's name to promote their double act. But after their first puppet show, for which they built a portable barn, they became popular in their own right. Born in 1964, the twins were the product of Milos Forman's second marriage, to Vera Kresadlova. Four years later, their father left Czechoslovakia for the US. Now he is hovering proudly in the background. \"He came to see the boat a month before the premiere,\" says Petr. \"He was at the Berlin film festival catching the Golden Bear award for The Man on the Moon, and he rented a car to pop over the border, sleeping in our caravan on the river's edge.\" Since then he has telephoned every day. Despite their father's financial and moral support, and the fact that Crimson Sails is playing to a packed boat every night, the money is running out. Each performance loses them around 65,000 crowns (\u00a31,200), and the musicians have to be paid from the proceeds of the boat's bar. \"We'll soon have to go begging to the ministry again,\" they say in unison. But then, pointing to a scale model of the Titanic on top of the bar, they manage a joke: \"Although the boat is sinking, we're still dancing.\"",

      "bodyText": "Australia knew in advance of the 1975 Indonesian invasion of East Timor and stood by for three days while Jakarta's troops prepared for the attack, secret documents released yesterday by the government revealed. Memos, cables and letters sent and received by Australia's foreign department between 1974 and 1976 confirmed that Australia gave tacit approval to Jakarta to annex the former Portuguese colony. East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence last year and is under temporary United Nations control after the referendum triggered a wave of violence by pro-Jakarta militias. Australia's foreign affairs minister, Alexander Downer, said the release of the documents ahead of the usual 30-year wait would help to clear the air over what is considered one of the most controversial events in Australian history. The papers show that Australia's embassy in Jakarta received full details from Indonesia of the timing of an attack on the Timorese town of Balibo in October 1975 - three days before it occurred. Five Australian journalists were killed in the assault. Mr Downer said that although the Labour government of Gough Whitlam had advance warning of the attack, there was no evidence that Australia could have prevented the journalists' deaths. \"The Department of Foreign Affairs had no information beforehand of any intentions to kill the journalists, although it did have prior knowledge of the planned invasion,\" he said. \"I'm not today, with 25 years of hindsight, going to pass judgment on the actions of Australian ministers and officials during this critical exercise, nor will I offer opinions about the conduct of other governments at the time.\" Australia's two main political parties have come under fire for their actions at the time. Mr Whitlam's Labour party was in office when Indonesia's then president Suharto ordered the invasion, and Malcolm Fraser's Liberal/National coalition was in power by the time Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976. Cabinet minutes from the time will not be released until the 30-year waiting period is up, and Mr Downer said intelligence reports might never be released for reasons of national security. Australia was the only western nation to recognise Indonesia's rule over East Timor. Human rights groups said up to 200,000 people died during the invasion and subsequent fighting and famine in East Timor, sparked by Portugal's withdrawal in 1975. Indonesia and its western allies reacted to the withdrawal with alarm, fearing that pro-communist East Timorese were taking over and that another communist stronghold would emerge in the region, months after the fall of Saigon to the communists. President Suharto also had tacit US support for the invasion, which took place just after a visit by the then president, Gerald Ford. With Vietnam fresh in mind, Australia told Jakarta it did not want to get involved in East Timor - a territory it had once called \"an essay in the hopeless\". Critics said this gave President Suharto a green light to invade. \"While preferring the integration of Portuguese Timor with Indonesia, the Whitlam government wished there to be a genuine act of self-determination in the territory,\" Mr Downer said. \"Fears that Indonesia might seek to obtain the territory otherwise than by these means led the Whitlam government to adopt a policy of studied detachment.\" Reuters",

      "bodyText": "Union leaders yesterday lashed out at Gordon Brown for failing to act over \"the disaster\" overtaking British manufacturing and what one called \"idiotic ideas\" about working harder and \"half-baked lectures about effort.\" As the Chancellor sat on the TUC conference podium GMB general union leader John Edmonds hit back at yesterday's report of Mr Browns call for a national productivity drive and told him: \"Gordon, you just have to do something about the monetary policy committee\" of the Bank of England. The committees decision about interest rates lay behind the high pound's impact on manufacturing jobs, he declared: \"It should spend less time fretting about inflation and more time responding to the needs of producers and ex porters\". \"Why cannot we have at least one member who works in manufacturing industry, or knows about manufacturing industry, or at least lives in a town that understands the importance of manufacturing industry.\" He asked, demanding treasury action to reduce the value of sterling. Before Mr Brown rose to address the congress, Mr Edmonds said he had read in the papers - a clear reference to the chancellor's trailed productivity appeal - that one solution to the manufacturing crisis was that British workers should work harder. The union leader said that whoever thought up \"these idiotic ideas\" should go and see women workers operating sewing machines on piece rate, who were desperate to increase their productivity but instead face the sack. He was echoed by Sir Ken Jackson, general secretary Amalgamated Engineering &amp; Electrical Union, who told Mr Brown that the over-valued pound was \"pricing British manufacturing out of the market, wiping out productivity gains overnight and prevent the investment needed to compete in the Global Economy.\" The Chancellor, who used his speech to insist that there would be no \"short-term lurches\" in tax policy in response to current protests, was at pain to defuse union criticism by emphasising that he understood their concerns about the exchange rate and manufacturing and by down playing his trailed demands for wage restraint. \"We will continue to do more to support manufacturing.\" He pledged, wooing his audience with the prize of \"full employment sustained for a generation,\" built on growth and pro ductivity. He appealed to unions and employers to work together with government to close the productivity gap with Britain's competitors, arguing that this was the foundation on which the country could \"achieve full employment, abolish child and pensioner poverty, build world class public services in education and health.\" But there could be \"no short -term lurches in spending policy or tax policy, no irresponsible spending increases or inflationary pay rises that put youth jobs at risk, no quick fixes or soft options, that would put long-term stability, public services and our policy for full employment at risk.\" Mr Brown used his first speech as chancellor to the TUC to praise the traditions and achievements of the labour movement, hailing the trade union pioneers as \"idealists not dreamers\" who \"knew it is easier to take your own share that fight for everyone to have a fair share\". But his reiteration of plans for an increase in the minimum wage and promise the ensure that pensioners gained more from Britain's rising prosperity left TUC delegates demanding more details. Union leaders were far less critical after they had heard the chancellor, but never the less wanted to know more. Rodney Bickerstaffe, leader of the public service union Unison, said he would have like to have heard more about what the chancellor planned to do about public sector pay and union concerns about the creeping privatisation of public services and need to restore the pension-earning link. Mr Edmunds said he hoped Mr Brown remarks about training opened the way for legally binding obligations on employers to invest in skills, but ruled out the chancellors suggestion that unions might move away from annual pay bargaining to promote economic stability.",

      "bodyText": "The suspended Detective Superintendent Ray \"Robocop\" Mallon is to face 14 disciplinary charges arising from the three-year-long corruption inquiry, Operation Lancet, which cleared him of criminal allegations this year. Mr Mallon, 45, is expected to be given details of conclusions reached by the police complaints authority before the end of the week, but he dismissed the issues involved yesterday as minor and a waste of public money. Cleveland police confirmed that charges were expected to be put to the former head of crime prevention in Middlesbrough \"within the next few days.\" The allegations are understood to arise from Lancet's investigation into claims that Mr Mallon's zero tolerance policy on Teesside involved drugs-for-information deals and other malpractices. Although he was cleared of criminal charges, he was later accused of leaking information. He said yesterday: \"The charges have been magnified by my accusers to suit their own ends in an attempt to justify to the public this lengthy and costly investigation. \"People will ... see the charges for what they are - an attempt by my accusers to justify their decisions and the spending of \u00a35m of public money.\" Mr Mallon has been suspended on full pay from the Cleveland force since December 1997, not very long after his views on hardline policing were sought by the then opposition leader, Tony Blair, as well as the Conservative home secretary, Michael Howard. A separate inquiry was launched last month into counter-claims that the Cleveland force's chief constable, Barry Shaw, had leaked material damaging to Mr Mallon. Ashok Kumar, MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, said: \"It has taken the PCA three months to make these charges. Obviously they have been scraping the barrel.\"",

      "bodyText": "Plot to kill Putin The Ukrainian and Russian security services claimed yesterday that Chechen assassins planned to kill President Vladimir Putin during the Kursk submarine crisis last month. Leonid Derkach, the head of Ukraine's security service, said four Chechens were detained in the run-up to a summit of leaders of former Soviet countries (CIS) in the Crimea in mid-August. They were \"suspected of preparing an attempt on the life of Vladimir Putin and deported from Ukraine,\" he said. Ian Traynor, Moscow Harare bombs A hand grenade attack on the headquarters of Zimbabwe's opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, damaged the building and two vehicles in central Harare. Police arrived late at the scene of the blast on Monday night, and left soon after, prompting MDC secretary-general Welshman Ncube to criticise them for not launching a serious investigation. \"This is obviously part of the terror campaign being waged by the state against any opposition to the ruling party, Zanu-PF,\" he said. Andrew Meldrum, Harare Mauritius poll The prime minister of Mauritius, Navin Ramgoolam, yesterday conceded defeat in the Indian Ocean island's general election. \"I recognise my party's defeat,\" Mr Ramgoolam said as tallies showed a virtual landslide defeat of his alliance by a coalition of the Socialist Militant Party and the Militant Party.
