Premiered anonymously in Vienna in 1790, the opera soon vanished into limbo - where it might have remained had not American scholar David Buch discovered it to be a composite on which no less than five composers collaborated. Four have been relegated to the footnotes of musical history. The fifth happened to be Mozart. </p> <p>The text (and some of the music) was by Emmanuel Schikaneder, who wrote the libretto for The Magic Flute, for which The Philosopher's Stone was, in some respects, a trial run. Allowing for shifts in gender, its plot - blending fairy tale, Freemasonic symbolism and whiffs of ancient Egyptian religion - is roughly the same. The benevolent, if emotionally-wounded deity Astromonte and his evil brother Eutifronte, battle for the life-conferring talisman of the title and for the souls of two contrasting pairs of human lovers, the aristocratic, virginal Nadir and Nadine, and the proletarian Lubano and his promiscuous wife Lubanera. </p> <p>The score, however, has none of the sublimity or numinous quality of the later opera. Given that five composers were involved, it does have a remarkable homogeneity of style, though Mozart's own contribution (10 minutes in a work lasting well over two hours) stands out a mile in terms of subtlety and emotional ambivalence. What is apparent, however, is that Mozart clearly learned from its flaws. Having an Osirian deity like Astromonte spouting stratospheric coloratura is a bit hard to take. Eutifronte, meanwhile, is an eloquent bass. In The Magic Flute, the musical polarities of good and evil are mercifully reversed in Sarastro's cavernous pronouncements and the Queen of the Night's bravura demonism. </p> <p>The performance, a concert version in an English translation by Barry Millington, is a hit-and-miss labour of love. Both Graeme Danby (Eutifronte) and Augustin Prunell-Friend (Astromonte, struggling with the role) camped it up rotten, when the piece should be taken seriously. The quartet of human lovers fared better. Carolyn Sampson's pure, crystalline Nadine sharply contrasted with Nicki Kennedy's deliciously sensual Lubanera. Nadir's hideously difficult, high-lying music was phrased with great beauty, if occasional strain, by Huw Rhys-Evans. Harry Bicket, favouring extreme speeds, conducted the Collegium Musicum 90, who compensated for some dodgy ensemble with some beautifully poised woodwind and brass solos.</p>",

      "body": "<p>For the great majority of the 400-odd professional cricketers plying their trade in this country, one of the game's great institutions was abandoned on the day last February when a dozen players were announced as having been offered England contracts. </p> <p>No more suspense at 11 o'clock on a Sunday morning when the squad for a test the following week was made public, no more waiting to see if the phone would ring and the chairman of selectors offer his congratulations and no more smart-arse dressing-room upstart commiserating with an old stager given the heave-ho by piping up that he too had not been selected and that the chairman had not bothered to ring him either. </p> <p>The announcement is done differently now as well. For the first test, David Graveney drove all the way up to Headingley to make his predictable announcement on Channel 4's Saturday morning magazine programme, whereupon the presenter Mark Nicholas, rather than the chairman, promptly phoned one of the new boys, Steve Harmison, announcing each digit as he dialled it, so that watching hacks who had been after the number for weeks without success were able to stick it into their contacts book. </p> <p>Yesterday, for the benefit of Sky Sports, Graveney was closer to home at Gloucestershire's waterlogged ground in Bristol, but after the comprehensive shafting of Zimbabwe at Lord's the message was much the same. </p> <p>The selectors had conversed by phone and the only resulting change was the enforced absence of Craig White, who suffered a blackout while walking in Scarborough last week and has undergone tests both to heart and brain. The results have not yet come back and White in any case has been ordered to rest for seven days. For this week's test at Trent Bridge he has not been replaced. </p> <p>The only speculation then will be whether the same XI takes the field, or whether Harmison gets a game at the expense of Chris Schofield, who, because of the outstanding performance by the England seamers, did not get a bowl at Lord's. </p> <p>Preparation of the pitch in Nottingham will have been hindered by the weather and the same damp conditions might reasonably be expected to apply: it will be another seam-dominated affair. Schofield will almost certainly be retained though for reasons of balance, and as an old-fashioned insurance policy. </p> <p>One of the big points of central contracts is the continuity they should bring, with the selectors, for the first time ever, having put their judgment on the line with, in theory, no recourse to the chopping and changing of old. </p> <p>Using a large number of players is not a recent phenomenon. In 1921, 30 players were used in five tests against Australia, 25 played during the four tests against West Indies in 1950 and 28 in 1988, when five matches were played against West Indies and one against Sri Lanka. Currently there are 67 players with England test caps registered for county cricket of whom 30 have fewer than five caps. </p> <p>However, any hopes of England powering their way through this summer with the same group were shattered almost from the word go when Dean Headley's back failed him again and Michael Vaughan's finger was shattered. </p> <p>Headley will not play again this summer, which would make him doubtful, presumably, for the first tour of the winter (to Pakistan, where his ability to reverse-swing the old ball would be invaluable), and although Vaughan should be batting for Yorkshire again soon, he has been overtaken by Nick Knight's moderate success at Lord's. </p> <p>With White now crocked, 25% of those contracted are currently ineligible. By and large the system, which lends security to those chosen and additional incentive to the rest, would seem to be a good thing. Darren Gough and Andy Caddick, for example, will be roaring in on Thursday having endured neither arduous county matches between tests nor the frustration of watching the rain. </p> <p>However, when injuries begin to bite and contracted players begin to show loss of form, then once more the pressure for a quick fix will mount on the selectors. The key to it then will be just how long they can hold on to their principles and their nerve. </p> <p> <strong> England squad: </strong> *<strong> Hussain </strong> (Essex), <strong> Atherton </strong> (Lancashire), <strong> Ramprakash </strong> (Middlesex), <strong> Hick </strong> (Worcestershire), <strong> Stewart </strong> (Surrey), <strong> Knight </strong> (Warwickshire), <strong> Flintoff </strong> (Lancashire), <strong> Schofield </strong> (Lancashire), <strong> Caddick </strong> (Somerset), <strong> Gough </strong> (Yorkshire), <strong> Giddins </strong> (Warwickshire), <strong> Harmison </strong> (Durham). </p>",

The results have not yet come back and White in any case has been ordered to rest for seven days. For this week's test at Trent Bridge he has not been replaced. The only speculation then will be whether the same XI takes the field, or whether Harmison gets a game at the expense of Chris Schofield, who, because of the outstanding performance by the England seamers, did not get a bowl at Lord's. Preparation of the pitch in Nottingham will have been hindered by the weather and the same damp conditions might reasonably be expected to apply: it will be another seam-dominated affair. Schofield will almost certainly be retained though for reasons of balance, and as an old-fashioned insurance policy. One of the big points of central contracts is the continuity they should bring, with the selectors, for the first time ever, having put their judgment on the line with, in theory, no recourse to the chopping and changing of old. Using a large number of players is not a recent phenomenon. In 1921, 30 players were used in five tests against Australia, 25 played during the four tests against West Indies in 1950 and 28 in 1988, when five matches were played against West Indies and one against Sri Lanka. Currently there are 67 players with England test caps registered for county cricket of whom 30 have fewer than five caps. However, any hopes of England powering their way through this summer with the same group were shattered almost from the word go when Dean Headley's back failed him again and Michael Vaughan's finger was shattered. Headley will not play again this summer, which would make him doubtful, presumably, for the first tour of the winter (to Pakistan, where his ability to reverse-swing the old ball would be invaluable), and although Vaughan should be batting for Yorkshire again soon, he has been overtaken by Nick Knight's moderate success at Lord's. With White now crocked, 25% of those contracted are currently ineligible. By and large the system, which lends security to those chosen and additional incentive to the rest, would seem to be a good thing. Darren Gough and Andy Caddick, for example, will be roaring in on Thursday having endured neither arduous county matches between tests nor the frustration of watching the rain. However, when injuries begin to bite and contracted players begin to show loss of form, then once more the pressure for a quick fix will mount on the selectors. The key to it then will be just how long they can hold on to their principles and their nerve. England squad: * Hussain (Essex), Atherton (Lancashire), Ramprakash (Middlesex), Hick (Worcestershire), Stewart (Surrey), Knight (Warwickshire), Flintoff (Lancashire), Schofield (Lancashire), Caddick (Somerset), Gough (Yorkshire), Giddins (Warwickshire), Harmison (Durham).",

That's why I'm the first person to say I've still got things to improve in my game.\" </p> <p>But he knows it would be fatal to change his game too much, especially if it disrupts that rare ability and courage he possesses to take defenders on. </p> <p>\"It's the only way I can play,\" he says. \"If you take some parts of my game away I'm not going to be the same player. I can't go and play like Alan Shearer or Emile Heskey. Alan is almost twice my size and almost three stone heavier. He is a target man and I am about getting in behind defenders and using my pace.\" </p> <p>However, Owen is still taking nothing for granted. \"I've helped myself with my performance against Brazil, certainly,\" he says. \"But there are still two games for a lot of people to stake their claim.\" </p> <p>One of those people is Fowler, another Liverpool player whose season has been blighted by injury. Keegan named him in the 28 even though he was still not match-fit. But a rigorous training regime in the last few days has left the player confident he can repay his manager's faith. </p> <p>\"I agree when people ask 'Is he fit, can he handle the pace and pressure of such a tournament?',\" admits Fowler. \"There's a lot at stake. But I personally don't think it would be a gamble to take me to the finals. I think I would be match-fit.\" </p> <p>Paul Ince needed to prove himself in a different way, and he made an impressive job of it on Saturday. \"When I left Liverpool people thought I would never play for England again, that I was going to Middlesbrough to graze. And it hurt,\" he said. \"That's why it's important for me to prove I've still got the hunger at 32. I love a challenge. I was asked to do a job and I thought I did it well.\" </p> <p>Seaman was also reluctant to listen to his critics. Despite fears that he is not the player he was, he predicted: \"This will not be my last tournament. I want to play in the next World Cup at least. I have no doubts about my fitness. I can go on for a long time.\" </p> <p>He surely will not if he continues to misjudge crosses as he did on Saturday. But Seaman's role in Brazil's equaliser was strangely missing from his personal analysis of the goal: \"The marking was bad and Gary Neville came off his post.\" </p> <p>Those concerned about the Arsenal goalkeeper's growing inability to make snap judgments will also be worried by his final observation: \"It all happened so quickly.\"</p>",

That's why I'm the first person to say I've still got things to improve in my game.\" But he knows it would be fatal to change his game too much, especially if it disrupts that rare ability and courage he possesses to take defenders on. \"It's the only way I can play,\" he says. \"If you take some parts of my game away I'm not going to be the same player. I can't go and play like Alan Shearer or Emile Heskey. Alan is almost twice my size and almost three stone heavier. He is a target man and I am about getting in behind defenders and using my pace.\" However, Owen is still taking nothing for granted. \"I've helped myself with my performance against Brazil, certainly,\" he says. \"But there are still two games for a lot of people to stake their claim.\" One of those people is Fowler, another Liverpool player whose season has been blighted by injury. Keegan named him in the 28 even though he was still not match-fit. But a rigorous training regime in the last few days has left the player confident he can repay his manager's faith. \"I agree when people ask 'Is he fit, can he handle the pace and pressure of such a tournament?',\" admits Fowler. \"There's a lot at stake. But I personally don't think it would be a gamble to take me to the finals. I think I would be match-fit.\" Paul Ince needed to prove himself in a different way, and he made an impressive job of it on Saturday. \"When I left Liverpool people thought I would never play for England again, that I was going to Middlesbrough to graze. And it hurt,\" he said. \"That's why it's important for me to prove I've still got the hunger at 32. I love a challenge. I was asked to do a job and I thought I did it well.\" Seaman was also reluctant to listen to his critics. Despite fears that he is not the player he was, he predicted: \"This will not be my last tournament. I want to play in the next World Cup at least. I have no doubts about my fitness. I can go on for a long time.\" He surely will not if he continues to misjudge crosses as he did on Saturday. But Seaman's role in Brazil's equaliser was strangely missing from his personal analysis of the goal: \"The marking was bad and Gary Neville came off his post.\" Those concerned about the Arsenal goalkeeper's growing inability to make snap judgments will also be worried by his final observation: \"It all happened so quickly.\"",

      "body": "<p>The septuagenarian Gillingham supporter in Australia who planned to phone a Kent radio station and listen to live commentary of this match certainly got his money's worth. If celebrations down under were otherwise muted, there was no mistaking the joy among his 50,000 fellow fans here. </p> <p>With seven minutes of extra-time remaining, Gillingham were heading for defeat by a 10-man Wigan. But headers by Steve Butler and Andy Thomson changed all that. A year ago Gillingham were heartbroken as Manchester City scored two late goals and beat them on penalties. This time it was their turn to turn a final on its head and secure promotion to the First Division. </p> <p>As Wigan's players sunk to the turf in disbelief, Gillingham's danced around as if they had not only taken the club to unprecedented heights but also won millions in the lottery. \"At 2-1 down I thought it was Wigan's day,\" the manager Peter Taylor admitted, dripping wet after being pushed into the bath by his squad. </p> <p>\"But the players have this inner strength. They never know when they are beaten. They deserve this, especially those who were here last year.\" </p> <p>Few could begrudge Taylor this success, having guided the team to third place in his first term. But Wigan will reflect angrily on the officials' failure to spot that Arjan de Zeeuw's header in the 65th minute, with the score 1-1, had crossed the line. \"It was well over,\" said their manager John Benson. \"You feel a bit cheated.\" </p> <p>Yet Benson can take pride from his team's contribution to a thrilling match, full of chances, neat football and controversy. Even Taylor admitted Wigan were the better side, and much of their passing play was impressive. But in Andy Hessenthaler, Gillingham had the outstanding performer. </p> <p>He was involved in the opening goal, finding Carl Asaba, whose low cross was diverted past his own goalkeeper by the sliding Pat McGibbon. De Zeeuw, ironically, just failed to clear off the line. </p> <p>By then Andy Liddell had hit the bar for Wigan and they deserved their equaliser through a stunning strike from Simon Haworth. After flicking up a De Zeeuw cross with his left boot, he used the outside of his right to volley over Vince Bartram and into the far corner. </p> <p>When De Zeeuw was denied his \"goal\", Wigan might have felt it was not their day. That seemed to be confirmed when Kevin Sharp was sent off in the 86th minute for a second booking, a foul on Nicky Southall which followed a caution for dissent. </p> <p>Stuart Barlow made nonsense of that idea, slotting in a 99th-minute penalty after Barry Ashby had fouled Darren Sheridan. But then Gillingham, courtesy of two substitutes, stirred. </p> <p>The 38-year-old player-coach Butler delivered the equaliser, heading in from Junior Lewis' cross. And then Ty Gooden's centre was met at the near post by a flying Thomson. He cost \u00a325,000. This week Taylor hopes to agree a new contract, but there will have to be a lot more money to spend than that. For now, though, such concerns can wait. </p> <p> <strong> Gillingham</strong> (3-5-2): Bartram; Ashby (Butler, 104min), Pennock, Butters; Southall, Hessenthaler, Lewis, Gooden, Edge (Smith, 61); Onuora (Thomson, 97), Asaba. </p> <p><strong> Wigan Athletic </strong> (3-5-2): Stillie; McGibbon, Balmer, De Zeeuw; Green, Redfearn (Barlow, 84), Kilford, Kilford, Sharp; Liddell (Bradshaw, 104), Haworth (Peron, 105). </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> R Styles (Waterlooville).</p>",

      "bodyText": "The septuagenarian Gillingham supporter in Australia who planned to phone a Kent radio station and listen to live commentary of this match certainly got his money's worth. If celebrations down under were otherwise muted, there was no mistaking the joy among his 50,000 fellow fans here. With seven minutes of extra-time remaining, Gillingham were heading for defeat by a 10-man Wigan. But headers by Steve Butler and Andy Thomson changed all that. A year ago Gillingham were heartbroken as Manchester City scored two late goals and beat them on penalties. This time it was their turn to turn a final on its head and secure promotion to the First Division. As Wigan's players sunk to the turf in disbelief, Gillingham's danced around as if they had not only taken the club to unprecedented heights but also won millions in the lottery. \"At 2-1 down I thought it was Wigan's day,\" the manager Peter Taylor admitted, dripping wet after being pushed into the bath by his squad. \"But the players have this inner strength. They never know when they are beaten. They deserve this, especially those who were here last year.\" Few could begrudge Taylor this success, having guided the team to third place in his first term. But Wigan will reflect angrily on the officials' failure to spot that Arjan de Zeeuw's header in the 65th minute, with the score 1-1, had crossed the line. \"It was well over,\" said their manager John Benson. \"You feel a bit cheated.\" Yet Benson can take pride from his team's contribution to a thrilling match, full of chances, neat football and controversy. Even Taylor admitted Wigan were the better side, and much of their passing play was impressive. But in Andy Hessenthaler, Gillingham had the outstanding performer. He was involved in the opening goal, finding Carl Asaba, whose low cross was diverted past his own goalkeeper by the sliding Pat McGibbon. De Zeeuw, ironically, just failed to clear off the line. By then Andy Liddell had hit the bar for Wigan and they deserved their equaliser through a stunning strike from Simon Haworth. After flicking up a De Zeeuw cross with his left boot, he used the outside of his right to volley over Vince Bartram and into the far corner. When De Zeeuw was denied his \"goal\", Wigan might have felt it was not their day. That seemed to be confirmed when Kevin Sharp was sent off in the 86th minute for a second booking, a foul on Nicky Southall which followed a caution for dissent. Stuart Barlow made nonsense of that idea, slotting in a 99th-minute penalty after Barry Ashby had fouled Darren Sheridan. But then Gillingham, courtesy of two substitutes, stirred. The 38-year-old player-coach Butler delivered the equaliser, heading in from Junior Lewis' cross. And then Ty Gooden's centre was met at the near post by a flying Thomson. He cost \u00a325,000. This week Taylor hopes to agree a new contract, but there will have to be a lot more money to spend than that. For now, though, such concerns can wait. Gillingham (3-5-2): Bartram; Ashby (Butler, 104min), Pennock, Butters; Southall, Hessenthaler, Lewis, Gooden, Edge (Smith, 61); Onuora (Thomson, 97), Asaba. Wigan Athletic (3-5-2): Stillie; McGibbon, Balmer, De Zeeuw; Green, Redfearn (Barlow, 84), Kilford, Kilford, Sharp; Liddell (Bradshaw, 104), Haworth (Peron, 105). Referee: R Styles (Waterlooville).",

He did everything we asked and more. His desperation to be a part of the squad hasn't surprised me, but it is very welcome. </p> <p>\"A lot of people have said that he won't be in the squad, and he's come back in later than some other players, but he's staked his claim. It was a difficult role for him today, because the Brazilians were moving all over the place.

But Arthur [Cox], whose eyes aren't the best, told me that it was Incey. People talk about great shots and great goals, but great tackles win matches too.\" </p> <p>Yet Ince, whose combativeness has sometimes led him astray, never took it too far on Saturday, thanks to Keegan's advice. \"I told him beforehand: 'I don't want you going all over the pitch fighting everyone else's battles. We've got other people now who have got the ability to do that. I want you to win your own.' </p> <p>\"I wasn't being unkind to him when I said that. It was just stating something that was obvious to me but maybe not obvious to him. In training he wanted to go and win that one over there, this one over here, and we were getting a little bit out of shape. But he did fantastically today.\" </p> <p>His withdrawal, bearing the marks of Amoroso's boot, was at Keegan's insistence. \"He didn't want to come off.

Fowler, a Keegan favourite whose domestic season was ruined by injury, came on for seven minutes as a substitute on Saturday, but will now be given an extended chance to show that he deserves a place at the expense of Andy Cole, whose injured toe has healed.

It will be the first time he has played for India since the Hansie Cronje betting scandal questioned the integrity of cricket not only in his own country but throughout the world. \"I arrived in England to play for Kent a few weeks ago on the day the Cronje story was in all the papers,\" he said. \"And I have not been home since, so I can only imagine what everyone is going through. \"I can honestly say no one has asked me to get involved in any betting situation.

      "body": "<p>The monsoon has arrived early in Bangladesh. The streets have been submerged with water. Rickshaw drivers have found themselves sloshing through mini-lagoons. Above the Bangabandhu national stadium in Dhaka, the sky has been stormy and tumultuous, turning at dusk to pink-black. Down on the pitch, it is hot and crazily humid - and wet. Yesterday's scheduled opening match, between the home side and Sri Lanka, was washed away. </p> <p>These are not ideal conditions for cricket. But then these are not ideal times at all. </p> <p>It is against an unsettled and steamy backdrop that this seventh Asia Cup between India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka is trying to take place. It is the first test of subcontinental cricket since Hansie Cronje last month made a late-night confession to an evangelical pastor that he had been involved in match-fixing. Since then cricket's fortunes have sunk. </p> <p>Over the past week in particular they have been falling especially fast: India's coach, Kapil Dev, has denied fresh claims by his former team-mate Manoj Prabhakar that he tried to bribe him to underperform in a match against Pakistan six years ago. \"I will give him one on his jaw,\" Kapil said, shrugging off the suggestion he should withdraw from the Dhaka tournament. The allegations were \"baseless and malicious\". So far only one Indian player has supported Prabhakar's claim. </p> <p>The Indian squad arrived yesterday to fresh allegations by Prabhakar. An undercover investigation, recorded on a secret camera and screened on Saturday, revealed senior Indian officials and players privately admitting that match-fixing was rife. </p> <p>In Pakistan, the former national team captain Salim Malik and the all-rounder Ata-ur-Rehman were last week banned for life by the Pakistan board following the publication of judge Malik Qayyum's report into match-fixing. His conclusions were scathing. \"Doubts of varying intensity have been cast on the integrity of some members of the team in their individual capacity,\" Qayyum found. </p> <p>Six other players were censured or fined either for bringing the game into disrepute or failing to cooperate with the inquiry, including Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mushtaq Ahmed, all now due to return from Pakistan's tour of West Indies. </p> <p>In previous years the Asia Cup has been a low-key affair. The one-day tournament, won by Sri Lanka when last held in 1997, had occupied a marginal place in the cricketing calendar. At various times in the past both India and Pakistan have declined to take part. </p> <p>But this time things are different. The satellite channel Star TV has been pumping out trailers for the event in India. \"It's all about honour,\" they point out. Seasoned cricket journalists who would normally be somewhere cooler are flying into Dhaka. And millions of ordinary Indian cricket fans are poised on their sofas, zappers ready, mildly depressed at the state of the game, but curiously expectant. </p> <p>Even before last week's shattering developments, Indian cricket was in an unprecedented mess. Its ruling body, the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI), is at war with itself and busy fending off allegations of corruption. </p> <p>Several other Indian players have come under suspicion besides Kapil. They include Mohammed Azharuddin, Ajay Jadeja and Nayan Mongia - all bar Mongia in the Asia Cup squad. No one could feel absolutely sure that the Indian squad is really interested in winning any more. </p> <p>With a giant question mark hanging over the probity of the entire sport, most commentators expect the Asia Cup to be the most transparent tournament for years. </p> <p>\"I think there will be enormous pressure on the players to play to their full capacity. I would be surprised if the Asia Cup is anything other than clean,\" Harsha Bhogle, one of India's leading cricket commentators said yesterday. \"There is no place for an innocent mistake at the moment, sadly. Everyone is watching,\" he added. </p> <p>Other commentators agree. \"It will be fascinating to see how the tournament unfolds,\" Pradeep Magazine, a cricket writer with the Indian Express, said. \"The players will be under great pressure to play properly. If they drop an easy catch or are run out, questions will be asked.\" </p> <p>\"Enjoy it, for it'll be the first clean tournament for some time,\" Surjit Bhalla wrote in last week's Outlook, the Indian magazine that first accused Kapil of corruption. </p> <p><strong> Best behaviour</strong><br> </p> <p> While the allegations of malpractice continue to swirl, the four teams involved in the Asia Cup are expected to be on their best behaviour. Bookmakers, who might normally congregate in the air-conditioned lobbies of Dhaka's Pan-Pacific and Sheraton hotels, where the players stay, are expected to be diplomatically absent. Over in the dressing rooms, the players will think twice before answering their mobiles. </p> <p>But for the vast underground betting industry which flourishes from India to Pakistan and the Gulf, the Asia Cup is business as usual. No concrete steps have been taken against the bookies in the wake of the Cronje affair. A proposal that betting on cricket should be legalised was ruled out by the Indian prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. While scandal enveloped the South Africa cricket captain, a few bookmakers - principally in Bombay - vanished for a while. Now they are back, sources suggest. </p> <p>Dr KK Paul, the head of Delhi police who released the Cronje tapes to an initially incredulous world audience, concedes as much. \"Illegal betting is still alive. These people continue to operate surreptitiously. Betting has been going on for a long time. You have to remember that betting was going on well before match-fixing. I'm afraid we can't really say we have eliminated it.\" </p> <p>Dr Paul's inquiry, meanwhile, is going nowhere. The South African authorities have failed to respond to requests for assistance, he says wearily. </p> <p>Though the odds are a closely guarded - and fluctuating - secret, bets are already being taken on the Asia Cup. Sri Lanka, with their tremendous one-day reputation, appear to be the favourites, ahead of a shattered Indian team and a Pakistan side still reeling from Qayyum's report. The Bangladesh players will be hoping to consolidate their country's bid for full test status. The big question is whether the rain will hold off to allow any cricket to be played at all. </p> <p>If previous betting patterns are anything to go by, Indian punters will not just bet on who will win the tournament. They will gamble on absolutely everything, including, for example, whether India will score above 100 in the first 15 overs, who wins the toss, the number of sixes and fours, man of the match, bowling order, the upshot of every ball, even the total number of wides. </p> <p>\"India have not played recently,\" said one source with contacts in the underworld. \"People are itching to bet.\" </p> <p>Naturally, the subcontinent's cricket officials are adamant that none of the seven scheduled matches will be, well, fixed. Syed Ashraful Haque, the secretary of the Bangladesh Cricket Board, said: \"I personally think it's going to be a very, very clean tournament. More so because the players are going to play their best so as to prove these allegations wrong.\" </p> <p>Haque is also convinced Cronje has done nothing wrong, declaring: \"I don't think he has fixed a match.\" </p> <p>Such sentiments appear to be shared by India's cricket establishment. For weeks now it has been in a state of deep, pathological denial. AC Muthia, president of the Indian board, last week declared that \"Indian cricket is clean\" - a statement greeted with barely concealed sniggers. </p> <p>Jagmohan Dalmiya, chairman of the International Cricket Council and the most powerful man in Indian cricket, has also dismissed the mountain of evidence implicating India's side in match-fixing. \"Most are unsubstantiated allegations,\" he said. </p> <p><strong> Messy feud</strong><br> </p> <p> The Indian board has been involved in a messy feud with IS Bindra, its defiant former president. Bindra has accused a series of top Indian officials, including Dalmiya, of corruption. He also backs Prabhakar's claim that Kapil was involved in match-fixing. Furthermore, he says he was forced to admonish three Indian players for betting on matches they were playing in. </p> <p>In turn the board has accused him of bringing the game into disrepute. India's Central Bureau of Inquiry, the national police investigation unit, has launched an official inquiry into match-fixing. </p> <p>An under-fire Dalmiya, meanwhile, has issued writs against three publications after they accused him of selling off the television rights to the 1998 ICC one-day tournament in Bangladesh too cheaply. His lawyers have also filed a case for defamation against Arun Agarwal, an Indian financial adviser. All the officials and players caught up in the scandal have denied impropriety. Outlook's mercurial editor, Vinod Mehta, is said to be relaxed about the ensuing legal battle. </p> <p>More than ever, then, this Asia Cup is about <em>amour-propre</em>. At stake, for the players, is personal reputation. However, they have less to lose than the ordinary cricket followers who bet badly and fail to pay up. </p> <p>Rajesh Joshi, a Dubai-based underworld don involved in the betting industry, recently gave an illuminating account of what happens to punters who do not settle their debts. \"We shoot some people, murder some and kidnap others,\" he said.</p>",

      "body": "<p>This will be the first of many despatches from the front because, make no mistake, the war has begun. The BBC has taken to prefacing any programme of vaguely male appeal - Grandstand, Alastair McGowan's Big Impression, Charlie Dimmock's gardening show - with \"This is BBC1, Home of Euro 2000\", while ITV counters with regular plays of the Euro 2000 promo featuring all their big names, and Bob Wilson. </p> <p>Bob, I notice, does not actually get to say anything, but he is clearly visible in one of the shots in the longer version of the trail, and it is good to see such a decent, honest professional has not been entirely airbrushed out of all the team photos. One assumes Bob's role will be peripheral, though. While Sir Desmond is swanning around the Low Countries in quasi-papal fashion in his specially fitted-out Desmobile, I expect Bob will be given a nearly new Vauxhall Cavalier and told to make sure he gets to the studio in time for the 2am highlights show. </p> <p>It is a vicious dirty business, TV, and it is going to get even dirtier over the next few weeks, I am pleased to say. The BBC had clearly been stung by all the recent jibes over its lack of top-quality sport, culminating in the embarrassing absence of Grandstand from the schedules the previous weekend, so they are determined to make the most of Euro 2000. </p> <p>\"We can hear the thoughts of David Beckham in a moment,\" said Ray Stubbs on Football Focus. Only a station that has gone Euro 2000 crazy would consider this to be in any way a come-on. Coming soon, the deep crosses to the far post of A A Alvarez. </p> <p>ITV can be a little more relaxed, having the rights to highlights of England's three warm-up matches, which gives them a chance to try out a few things in the phoney war period, before the Battle for Europe begins in earnest.

      "bodyText": "This will be the first of many despatches from the front because, make no mistake, the war has begun. The BBC has taken to prefacing any programme of vaguely male appeal - Grandstand, Alastair McGowan's Big Impression, Charlie Dimmock's gardening show - with \"This is BBC1, Home of Euro 2000\", while ITV counters with regular plays of the Euro 2000 promo featuring all their big names, and Bob Wilson. Bob, I notice, does not actually get to say anything, but he is clearly visible in one of the shots in the longer version of the trail, and it is good to see such a decent, honest professional has not been entirely airbrushed out of all the team photos. One assumes Bob's role will be peripheral, though. While Sir Desmond is swanning around the Low Countries in quasi-papal fashion in his specially fitted-out Desmobile, I expect Bob will be given a nearly new Vauxhall Cavalier and told to make sure he gets to the studio in time for the 2am highlights show. It is a vicious dirty business, TV, and it is going to get even dirtier over the next few weeks, I am pleased to say. The BBC had clearly been stung by all the recent jibes over its lack of top-quality sport, culminating in the embarrassing absence of Grandstand from the schedules the previous weekend, so they are determined to make the most of Euro 2000. \"We can hear the thoughts of David Beckham in a moment,\" said Ray Stubbs on Football Focus. Only a station that has gone Euro 2000 crazy would consider this to be in any way a come-on. Coming soon, the deep crosses to the far post of A A Alvarez. ITV can be a little more relaxed, having the rights to highlights of England's three warm-up matches, which gives them a chance to try out a few things in the phoney war period, before the Battle for Europe begins in earnest. Like Kevin Keegan, though, they went for the familiar for the Brazil match; Des, Terry, Clive and Big Ron, very much an Adams, Keown, Campbell and G Neville back four. If they have anything innovative planned, they are keeping their powder dry for a couple of weeks yet. There was, of course, several million pounds worth of talent on display in the England-Brazil match - and some highly-paid footballers too - but sport can be just as interesting lower down the food chain, as two excellent documentaries illustrated in the past week. My FC was unusually - almost uniquely - a late-night programme on Channel 5 which a young, predominantly male, audience was invited to view with brain engaged and both hands free. Terry Alderton, a stand-up comic, returned to Southend United, the team he has supported all his life and for whom he played briefly as a schoolboy goalkeeper, until his football career was cruelly cut short. After saving a penalty, Terry imitated Michael Jackson's moonwalk and conceded an indirect free-kick - which led to a goal for deadly rivals Colchester, and the suggestion that his future might lie elsewhere. You could tell this was some distance from Euro 2000 because the kit manager John Threadgold was carefully counting out 16 towels for the trip to Leyton Orient. \"You have to make sure it's exactly 16,\" said Threadgold, \"Otherwise the buggers will use more than they should.\" Manager Alan Little's half-time team talks were satisfyingly foul-mouthed, and should act as useful counterbalance to all the talk about systems and so on that we will be treated to over the next few weeks. \"Let's fucking go and do it,\" said Little. \"These fuckers are no good.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown will offer Britain's elite universities - not just Oxbridge - an olive branch in his midsummer spending review when he gives them extra funds to create talent-spotting teams to prevent exceptional students from poor backgrounds slipping through the net. Ministers are adamant that they are not backing down from the Brown-led campaign against educational privilege in the face of widespread criticism and charges of \"class warfare\". John Prescott and David Blunkett will join the fray this week. But some have been troubled by the chancellor's tone when he cited the Tyneside sixth-former Laura Spence's \"scandalous\" problems with admission to Oxford without knowing all the details. \"This is not about extremism or envy politics. It's about excellence and extending opportunity to all,\" one senior minister insisted. Despite persistent pressure, most of Britain's top 10 universities fail to find the best students from all social classes, ministers and officials stress. Their US equivalents, Ivy League colleges such as Harvard, Stanford, Princeton and Yale, devote up to 50 staff to talent-spotting and recruiting the ablest pupils, especially the poorest. Mr Brown has told colleagues that in the 25 years he has known Harvard it has turned from being a \"finishing school for elites\" into a university that is genuinely open for all. Tony Blair, who is spending this week at Chequers examining election options and details of Mr Brown's July spending review, remains solidly behind the \"opportunity for all\" initiatives that party strategists believe will revive support for core Labour values. \"This is not about class warfare or putting up barriers. It is about breaking them down,\" said a Downing Street official. Meanwhile the health secretary, Alan Milburn, who has a sharp ear for class politics, said he wanted to widen access to medical schools for poorer pupils, and Robin Cook renewed his attack on the public school/Oxbridge bloc in the Foreign Office. Like Mr Brown, he has often made the case against unwarranted privilege. But some ministers are uneasy about Mr Brown's style, which revived painful memories of the \"War of Jennifer's Ear\", a row over NHS treatment during the 1992 election. Then, as now, the individual case became more complex under media scrutiny. \"Gordon saw an opportunity to get something up in lights. We now see that it hasn't been carefully worked through,\" said one cabinet member. Education department sources welcomed the chancellor's commitment to tie more government cash in the July review to schemes such as talent spotting, twinning universities with inner-city schools and employing \"ambassadors\" to encourage students in poorer areas to apply. As the affair rumbled on, John Stein, senior medical fellow at Magdalen college, revealed that Laura Spence had come only 11th out of 23 candidates chasing five places. She did best in the interview, the part of the application process said to disadvantage comprehensive school students. David Blunkett, the education secretary, will refer to the controversy in a speech this week at the National Association of Head Teachers' conference. Three weeks ago he announced measures designed to encourage more working-class applications to Oxbridge.

      "body": "<p>Two words are inked indelibly on the mind of David Liddiment at the moment: \"Remember Eldorado.\" The ITV programming chief is about to take the biggest risk of his tenure since the scrapping of News at Ten, and commission a \u00a315m daily soap for the most fickle of television audiences: teens, young mums and grannies. The wrong choice would taint his reputation for good; a success would be the crown ing glory of the Liddiment era. Somewhat typically, he has opted for the hard route. </p> <p>Liddiment could have snapped up another ready-made Aussie series to fill the gap left by Channel 5's dawn raid on Home and Away, but instead he has delighted British production houses (and set advertisers' nerves on edge) by opting to build a new soap from scratch. </p> <p>Again taking the risky route, he then opened up the field to whoever wanted to pitch for the slot. It was an opportunity that programme-makers could not miss. </p> <p>The process of selecting a shortlist would have made a pretty good mini-series in itself. Carlton's PR-minded programming head Lord (Waheed) Alli was the first to break the vow of silence in the bidding process, going public with his audacious campaign to resurrect the shaky 70s soap Crossroads. It was clearly a successful campaign for, however much it irritated Liddiment, a head of steam guaranteed the Carlton pitch a place in the final few. Around 10 others made it to the \"beauty contest\" stage, and now the list has been whittled down to six (see panel): the short-listed bidders have been asked to come up with three full scripts and story outlines for three months' worth of episodes, for a July deadline. </p> <p>When Liddiment returns to London from the California sun where he is currently basking on his business-cum-holiday break, he will start the process of sifting through the scripts with his drama chief, Nick Elliott. It will be a hard decision - and before the soap goes on screen, no one really has much idea whether it will work. </p> <p>\"If there was a formula for it, then nobody would ever make a new soap and fail,\" says Corinne Hollingworth, a former executive producer of EastEnders and now controller of drama at Channel 5. She speaks with bitter experience: at the BBC, she was brought in towards the end of Eldorado in a last-ditch attempt to revive the dying show's fortunes. </p> <p>ITV is in an even more difficult position now than the BBC was in 1992 when Eldorado was launched: the soap market has almost reached saturation point. \"There are three or four long dramas in the UK that have epic status already, and there is a huge loyalty to them,\" says Hollingworth. </p> <p>To persuade eight to 10 million people to spend an extra half an hour in front of the television during their increasingly crowded days is a major challenge. \"You have to give something to the audience that they are not getting already. What you have to try and do is persuade the audience to make the emotional commitment to make the show part of their lives.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, ITV was right, she believes, to go for a new commission rather than pick an off-the-shelf Australian or American product. \"Their audience is not what it used to be. They don't have the epic nature of a Coronation Street or EastEnders, and they don't define a channel. Brookside is quintessential Channel 4 - edgy, set in Liverpool, EastEnders is heavy, it's about issues and clearly BBC1. Coronation Street and Emmerdale are clearly associated with ITV. What you want is something that reflects what the channel is about, and can become a flagship. Nobody would say that Neighbours encapsulates BBC1 or Home and Away encapsulates ITV.\" </p> <p>The new show should have a firm contemporary feel, she says. \"I think anybody who is approaching a soap has to make it part of its time. Although EastEnders and Coronation Street are monoliths, they are products of their own time. Who wants another one? It has to be something different.\" It will be a challenge - the budget, \u00a345,000 for half an hour, is tight. </p> <p>Brian Park, part of the team behind the bid from Shed productions and the \"axeman\" producer who presided over the traumatic modernisation of Coronation Street, says ITV is clear in its intention to develop a series that is identifiably British, rather than simply an anglicised Home and Away. \"What they seem to be implying is that they don't want a British version of Aussie-dom. I would be surprised if they went for a series set on a Cornish beach, all fitness clubs, bronzed pecs and tight T-shirts.

      "bodyText": "Two words are inked indelibly on the mind of David Liddiment at the moment: \"Remember Eldorado.\" The ITV programming chief is about to take the biggest risk of his tenure since the scrapping of News at Ten, and commission a \u00a315m daily soap for the most fickle of television audiences: teens, young mums and grannies. The wrong choice would taint his reputation for good; a success would be the crown ing glory of the Liddiment era. Somewhat typically, he has opted for the hard route. Liddiment could have snapped up another ready-made Aussie series to fill the gap left by Channel 5's dawn raid on Home and Away, but instead he has delighted British production houses (and set advertisers' nerves on edge) by opting to build a new soap from scratch. Again taking the risky route, he then opened up the field to whoever wanted to pitch for the slot. It was an opportunity that programme-makers could not miss. The process of selecting a shortlist would have made a pretty good mini-series in itself. Carlton's PR-minded programming head Lord (Waheed) Alli was the first to break the vow of silence in the bidding process, going public with his audacious campaign to resurrect the shaky 70s soap Crossroads. It was clearly a successful campaign for, however much it irritated Liddiment, a head of steam guaranteed the Carlton pitch a place in the final few. Around 10 others made it to the \"beauty contest\" stage, and now the list has been whittled down to six (see panel): the short-listed bidders have been asked to come up with three full scripts and story outlines for three months' worth of episodes, for a July deadline. When Liddiment returns to London from the California sun where he is currently basking on his business-cum-holiday break, he will start the process of sifting through the scripts with his drama chief, Nick Elliott. It will be a hard decision - and before the soap goes on screen, no one really has much idea whether it will work. \"If there was a formula for it, then nobody would ever make a new soap and fail,\" says Corinne Hollingworth, a former executive producer of EastEnders and now controller of drama at Channel 5. She speaks with bitter experience: at the BBC, she was brought in towards the end of Eldorado in a last-ditch attempt to revive the dying show's fortunes. ITV is in an even more difficult position now than the BBC was in 1992 when Eldorado was launched: the soap market has almost reached saturation point. \"There are three or four long dramas in the UK that have epic status already, and there is a huge loyalty to them,\" says Hollingworth. To persuade eight to 10 million people to spend an extra half an hour in front of the television during their increasingly crowded days is a major challenge. \"You have to give something to the audience that they are not getting already. What you have to try and do is persuade the audience to make the emotional commitment to make the show part of their lives.\" Nevertheless, ITV was right, she believes, to go for a new commission rather than pick an off-the-shelf Australian or American product. \"Their audience is not what it used to be. They don't have the epic nature of a Coronation Street or EastEnders, and they don't define a channel. Brookside is quintessential Channel 4 - edgy, set in Liverpool, EastEnders is heavy, it's about issues and clearly BBC1. Coronation Street and Emmerdale are clearly associated with ITV. What you want is something that reflects what the channel is about, and can become a flagship. Nobody would say that Neighbours encapsulates BBC1 or Home and Away encapsulates ITV.\" The new show should have a firm contemporary feel, she says. \"I think anybody who is approaching a soap has to make it part of its time. Although EastEnders and Coronation Street are monoliths, they are products of their own time. Who wants another one? It has to be something different.\" It will be a challenge - the budget, \u00a345,000 for half an hour, is tight. Brian Park, part of the team behind the bid from Shed productions and the \"axeman\" producer who presided over the traumatic modernisation of Coronation Street, says ITV is clear in its intention to develop a series that is identifiably British, rather than simply an anglicised Home and Away. \"What they seem to be implying is that they don't want a British version of Aussie-dom. I would be surprised if they went for a series set on a Cornish beach, all fitness clubs, bronzed pecs and tight T-shirts. I think there is a desire to see something that's home grown and identifiable to young people.\" Park cannot resist a dig at the rival Carlton bid: \"Motels are just not part of the life experience of most young people today.\" Mal Young, the head of continuing drama at the BBC and a veteran of many successful series - his latest daytime offering, Doctors, is performing impressively on BBC1 - believes the greatest soaps are \"born out of the passion to tell stories\". Each of the most successful long-running drama series was created by a programme-maker with a zeal for the genre. Coronation Street had Tony Warren, EastEnders was driven by Julia Smith, Phil Redmond was the force behind Brookside: a large production team on the monster that is a daily soap will need clear direction from the top, he says. \"You need a key creative individual who can also be a manager. It is going to need that person at the forefront for a minimum of four years. You can't set it up and walk away. You have to live and breathe it. When you go on holiday, the programme is still going.\" And the secret of a good soap? Good storylines, says Park; accessibility, adds Young. \"It's as simple and as difficult as that,\" agrees Hollingworth. When the new series is finally chosen in July, ITV will have to persuade people to watch it. When it finally comes on air, sometime next year, Home and Away will be well established on Channel 5, and the audience for the teatime slot will have drifted away - unless ITV's plan to screen the celebrity gossip show OK!TV in the interim keeps them happy. Young says the network will have to play on the tabloid fascination with soap to spread the word. \"They are going to have to rely for the first few weeks on word of mouth. They are going to have to use the media, they must create characters that we love - and love to hate - and that compel us to follow their lives.\" Family Affairs, he says, suffered because it was unable to build up a head of steam.

The early radio and agency reports had talked merely of an \"American and a Spanish journalist\". The blandness conjured up images of young rookie hacks. Of unknowns who were new to war and pushing their luck up country, way out of Freetown. Chancers. Damn fools who should have listened to advice. </p> <p>Then the American became \"veteran war correspondent Kurt Schork working for the Reuter news agency\". And the Spaniard became \"award winning news cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno of the APTN agency\". They were not household names outside the news business. But they were icons of nerve and brilliance to those of us who frequently read Schork's words on our newsroom VDUs and laptops, or viewed Moreno's often stark news video. </p> <p>How could two of the most savvy and experienced reporters ever be killed in this way? </p> <p>Two days earlier in Southern Lebanon, Abed Taboush, another name known only in the news business, was killed. Taboush was driving BBC correspondent Jeremy Bowen and his cameraman Malek Kenaan, a Lebanese freelance working for Reuters. Taboush was still inside his car when it was hit by an Israeli artillery shell. Or was he targeted and murdered in a final act of Israeli military spite? </p> <p>Taboush's death, and Jeremy Bowen's narrow escape on the day the BBC announced he would be the new presenter of the new BBC1 and News24 breakfast programme, also created shockwaves, especially in BBC newsrooms. </p> <p>In our news world, where reputation, nerve and toughness mean a better chance of professional success, emotion is usually suppressed and rarely comes easily. But last week the mask of macho invincibility slipped. </p> <p>To the many who have done Chechnya, Kosovo, Bosnia and Sarajevo, this was more than just a personal loss. Whether by design or default, the deaths of Schork and Moreno marked the new assault on an increasingly threatened fundamental issue in the news business - the right and obligation to bear witness. To be there. To report.

      "bodyText": "Even the most war-hardened cameramen and journalists must have felt that cold shiver of shock. The early radio and agency reports had talked merely of an \"American and a Spanish journalist\". The blandness conjured up images of young rookie hacks. Of unknowns who were new to war and pushing their luck up country, way out of Freetown. Chancers. Damn fools who should have listened to advice. Then the American became \"veteran war correspondent Kurt Schork working for the Reuter news agency\". And the Spaniard became \"award winning news cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno of the APTN agency\". They were not household names outside the news business. But they were icons of nerve and brilliance to those of us who frequently read Schork's words on our newsroom VDUs and laptops, or viewed Moreno's often stark news video. How could two of the most savvy and experienced reporters ever be killed in this way? Two days earlier in Southern Lebanon, Abed Taboush, another name known only in the news business, was killed. Taboush was driving BBC correspondent Jeremy Bowen and his cameraman Malek Kenaan, a Lebanese freelance working for Reuters. Taboush was still inside his car when it was hit by an Israeli artillery shell. Or was he targeted and murdered in a final act of Israeli military spite? Taboush's death, and Jeremy Bowen's narrow escape on the day the BBC announced he would be the new presenter of the new BBC1 and News24 breakfast programme, also created shockwaves, especially in BBC newsrooms. In our news world, where reputation, nerve and toughness mean a better chance of professional success, emotion is usually suppressed and rarely comes easily. But last week the mask of macho invincibility slipped. To the many who have done Chechnya, Kosovo, Bosnia and Sarajevo, this was more than just a personal loss. Whether by design or default, the deaths of Schork and Moreno marked the new assault on an increasingly threatened fundamental issue in the news business - the right and obligation to bear witness. To be there. To report. And then to make information available to all those who want to see the video and need to know the facts, however ghastly. \"I have never seen the industry in such shock.

      "body": "<p>Settling down in my local cinema to see Gladiator, I was transported back in time by the new British Airways ad cut to the stirring sound of Thunderclap Newman's anthem Something in the Air. It was particularly striking because my first-ever film was a self-funded three-minute pop promo featuring Thunderclap Newman when he was an unknown telephone engineer. Self-funded just meant it was shot in black and white and cost a princely \u00a375. It was flattering to see the marginally more expensive BA ad copy exactly the same Pied Piper concept. </p> <p>The insistent hook in Thunderclap's song goes: \"We'd better get together sooner or later because the revolution's here.\" Even Thunderclap wasn't prophetic enough to have the digital revolution in mind but the sense of urgency in the song sums up the current media mood very well. We are living through a second industrial revolution. Where there was once Crompton's Mule and the Spinning Jenny there is now ADSL and Tivo. </p> <p>Formerly, broadband was a word used only to describe trouser sizes in outsize clothes shops. Now it's the new rock'n'roll. Scarcely a day goes by without a new broadband initiative being announced, as consumers become all-powerful, spoilt for choice and, finally, freed from the tyranny of what broadcasters want them to see. </p> <p>Perversely, this maelstrom of technical and economic change finds mainstream television treading water, thanks to a random confluence of events. The BBC is waiting for the true impact of Greg Dyke's changes to wash through the organisation. The ITV companies circle each other like boxers while the competition commission decides whether there can be a points win, a draw or a knockout punch. Sky is in the corporate changing room waiting for news on the all important soccer rights and Channel 5 staff are on compulsory French and German classes as they measure the impact of the CLT-UFA/Pearson merger. </p> <p>Yet no organisation can currently afford to stand still for a second. Terrestrial television may be preoccupied with other matters but new media initiatives are being pursued urgently, even recklessly, however uncertain the immediate future. The pace is so electric that everyone just has to go for it. </p> <p>In this whirlwind of change one of the key challenges is how we access and train talent. In the short term it is the familiar names and brands that will migrate most easily onto new distribution systems, offering certainty in a plethora of choices. The acquisition of talent-based independent producers by broadcasters is a sure sign of this. But the desperate skill-hunt will not just be for established on-screen talent. </p> <p>Now New Media Guardian advertises more jobs than Media Guardian. While scores of people in old media chase one job, in new media almost the opposite applies - too many jobs chasing too little talent. This generation of creative entrepreneurs, the equivalents of the men and women who set up independent production companies in the 1980s, will start up internet ventures not indies. Until the demise of boo.com the culture of envy ran deep in the TV industry, as everyone discovered that the producer in the next office was starting a net company and threatening to became an instant millionaire. How does mainstream television compete in this new world? We have always had the pick of the crop, but not any more. The lure of an apparent British cinema renaissance has already seduced some top talent and now the excitement of the web world is proving even more attractive. </p> <p> This has overlapped with a dulling of the television experience. Of course, there are still peaks like The League of Gentlemen or Ali G but, let's face it, there is a huge amount of run-of-the-mill television. New media suddenly seems more exciting. I am very struck by the number of producers who come alive when they talk about the creative challenges of the wired world. </p> <p>Coincidentally, many of the apparently old-fashioned skills of conventional production - particularly the understanding of narrative - are becoming extremely prized online. As one new media expert baldly said to me recently, \"All those techies with ponytails and body piercing need some story-telling skills.\" </p> <p>Television now urgently needs to rethink its training and recruitment strategies. We must remove the division between old and new media for our young talent and just train across all media, as well as retraining more experienced staff.

      "bodyText": "Settling down in my local cinema to see Gladiator, I was transported back in time by the new British Airways ad cut to the stirring sound of Thunderclap Newman's anthem Something in the Air. It was particularly striking because my first-ever film was a self-funded three-minute pop promo featuring Thunderclap Newman when he was an unknown telephone engineer. Self-funded just meant it was shot in black and white and cost a princely \u00a375. It was flattering to see the marginally more expensive BA ad copy exactly the same Pied Piper concept. The insistent hook in Thunderclap's song goes: \"We'd better get together sooner or later because the revolution's here.\" Even Thunderclap wasn't prophetic enough to have the digital revolution in mind but the sense of urgency in the song sums up the current media mood very well. We are living through a second industrial revolution. Where there was once Crompton's Mule and the Spinning Jenny there is now ADSL and Tivo. Formerly, broadband was a word used only to describe trouser sizes in outsize clothes shops. Now it's the new rock'n'roll. Scarcely a day goes by without a new broadband initiative being announced, as consumers become all-powerful, spoilt for choice and, finally, freed from the tyranny of what broadcasters want them to see. Perversely, this maelstrom of technical and economic change finds mainstream television treading water, thanks to a random confluence of events. The BBC is waiting for the true impact of Greg Dyke's changes to wash through the organisation. The ITV companies circle each other like boxers while the competition commission decides whether there can be a points win, a draw or a knockout punch. Sky is in the corporate changing room waiting for news on the all important soccer rights and Channel 5 staff are on compulsory French and German classes as they measure the impact of the CLT-UFA/Pearson merger. Yet no organisation can currently afford to stand still for a second. Terrestrial television may be preoccupied with other matters but new media initiatives are being pursued urgently, even recklessly, however uncertain the immediate future. The pace is so electric that everyone just has to go for it. In this whirlwind of change one of the key challenges is how we access and train talent. In the short term it is the familiar names and brands that will migrate most easily onto new distribution systems, offering certainty in a plethora of choices. The acquisition of talent-based independent producers by broadcasters is a sure sign of this. But the desperate skill-hunt will not just be for established on-screen talent. Now New Media Guardian advertises more jobs than Media Guardian. While scores of people in old media chase one job, in new media almost the opposite applies - too many jobs chasing too little talent. This generation of creative entrepreneurs, the equivalents of the men and women who set up independent production companies in the 1980s, will start up internet ventures not indies. Until the demise of boo.com the culture of envy ran deep in the TV industry, as everyone discovered that the producer in the next office was starting a net company and threatening to became an instant millionaire. How does mainstream television compete in this new world? We have always had the pick of the crop, but not any more. The lure of an apparent British cinema renaissance has already seduced some top talent and now the excitement of the web world is proving even more attractive. This has overlapped with a dulling of the television experience. Of course, there are still peaks like The League of Gentlemen or Ali G but, let's face it, there is a huge amount of run-of-the-mill television. New media suddenly seems more exciting. I am very struck by the number of producers who come alive when they talk about the creative challenges of the wired world. Coincidentally, many of the apparently old-fashioned skills of conventional production - particularly the understanding of narrative - are becoming extremely prized online. As one new media expert baldly said to me recently, \"All those techies with ponytails and body piercing need some story-telling skills.\" Television now urgently needs to rethink its training and recruitment strategies. We must remove the division between old and new media for our young talent and just train across all media, as well as retraining more experienced staff. Crucially, all of us, young and not so young, have to learn to think differently, to use our traditional skills in a way that bends traditional genres and makes new media as exciting for the consumer as it is for the creator. If we don't, we will disappear from view. Just like Thunderclap Newman. John Willis is chief executive, United Productions",

      "body": "<p>There is, touchingly, still a belief among newspaper controllers - even experienced ones such as Rupert Murdoch and his Wapping supremo Les Hinton - that editors can change the course of history. That's why they have replaced Phil Hall with Rebekah Wade as News of the World editor. </p> <p>They believe that she might have the qualities - femininity, youth, intelligence, charm and a ferocious work ethic - to reverse the paper's long circulation decline. They also evidently have enough faith in their new choice to allow her to rip the paper apart and start all over again. Though it has been starved of resources in the past couple of years, there will be investment to add value to what has become, in contrast to its middle and up-market rivals, a rather insipid package. </p> <p>It isn't that Murdoch and Hinton don't appreciate Hall's efforts. True, they did think him just a little too laid-back, almost too ready to accept that the job of editing the NoW has become one of managing decline. But they also recognised that he had done his best and, along the way, achieved some notable successes. </p> <p>What they seek from Wade is a burst of vitality and a willingness to take risks. Hall had gone a bit soft, it is whispered, becoming too accommodating to the restraints imposed by the editors' code of practice, reinforced by his membership of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC). In other words, he had become too responsible, rather like one of his predecessors, Patsy Chapman, another PCC stalwart who helped draw up the editors' code. She eventually stepped down from the editorship due to illness. Hall, a picture of rude health, required a push. </p> <p>At first glance his sales record doesn't look too good. When he took over in September 1995, the NoW was selling 4.78m. Last Sunday, I understand, the paper barely sold 3.8m. Its last audited sale, in April, was just above 4m. But the market for the three Sunday red-tops has been going down steeply for 30 years and, in the past six months, has taken a nose-dive. (Could that, incidentally, be a delayed reaction to the demise of Princess Diana?) Despite a mini-revival of fortunes at the Sunday Mirror, Hall's NoW still improved its market share. Though it remains Britain's highest-selling paper, some analysts, not least those in Murdoch's organisation, have been forecasting that within two years it could sell fewer than the Sun, despite the latter also gradually losing sales. </p> <p>Hinton and Hall are friends, but business is business. It was time for the 12th change of editor in 30 years (an average of one every 30 months). Wade, champing at the bit as deputy to the Sun's David Yelland, was the perfect choice. </p> <p>Let's scotch one mistaken rumour: she was not appointed because of being offered the Daily Mirror editorship. Piers Morgan is secure. Nor did Trinity-Mirror offer her any other post. She has got the NoW chair because of Hinton's concern at the NoW sales decline and because he regards her as the best hope of turning it round. At 31, she is Fleet Street's youngest editor, but her experience at the NoW goes back a long way. Having joined the paper in 1989, she rose from feature-writing, through junior executive status on its Sunday magazine and on to deputy editor. She was translated to the Sun in the same position in January 1998 and has harboured thoughts of winning the paper's editorship ever since. </p> <p>When I was first introduced to Wade, her friend and colleague Judy Muggier announced: \"This is going to be the first woman to edit a daily tabloid.\" Well, the Daily Express's Rosie Boycott has taken that honour, but Muggier's prediction speaks volumes about the perception of Wade by other journalists. She has never tried to conceal her ambition, a very un-British quality that has made her the target, if not of envy, certainly of scorn. Every anecdote about her centres on her naked ambition to rise to the top. \"She is,\" says a female friend, with a mixture of admiration and disdain, \"extraordinarily motivated.\" </p> <p>Men, failing to conceal sexist undertones, are less complimentary. She didn't come up the \"right way\", I was told. She has never stood on a doorstep for hours. She hasn't been at the sharp end. And here's a giveaway: she started off as a secretary. </p> <p>Why a man who succeeds after starting off as a messenger boy should be appreciated more than a woman who begins as a secretary is one of those little prejudices that Women in Journalism might like to address. Wade is, after all, the chair of the organisation that campaigns to raise women's profile, and women's issues, in the media. </p> <p>Anyway, from the age of 14 Wade's single aim was to become a journalist. While still at her Cheshire grammar school, she spent weekends and holidays at Eddy Shah's Messenger titles in Warrington. She took a detour four years later by living in Paris and writing for magazines before returning to Britain in 1988 to work for Shah's short-lived attempt to launch a national paper, the Post. </p> <p>Ostensibly secretary to features editor Graham Ball, she presented Ball with lists of ideas and spent all the time she could looking over the shoulders of reporters and executives. Everyone I have spoken to talks about how Wade unashamedly looks and learns. A former colleague told me: \"You can almost hear her say, 'So that's how it's done.' Unlike others, though, she never forgets the lesson.\" </p> <p>Her determination also stands out. Ball recalls that Post editor Lloyd Turner was desperate to run a readers' offer for an aphrodisiac lager available only in Strasbourg. He needed someone to drive there and back. Wade volunteered, enduring an embarrassing search at Dover by customs officials convinced the pale-faced, waif-like girl was more likely to be carrying drugs than drink. </p> <p>Soon after, she joined the NoW, having been recommended by Sun veteran Charlie Rae, and impressed executives there with her energy, enthusiasm and, above all, her charm. \"She was a brilliant fixer,\" recalls writer Jean Russia. \"She could persuade people who would usually run a mile from the News of the World to talk to us. Her sweet-talking telephone manner was astonishing.\" </p> <p>There is also unanimity about another of Wade's attributes: her candour. She says what she thinks and wants and, in a business noted for deviousness, she is remarkably straightforward. The famous occasion when she killed a bogus NoW story about the Beast of Bodmin, saving the paper from a humiliating mistake, proves the point. Even so, once a deputy, her relationships with her editors have been rather tense. </p> <p>She got on well with the man who appointed her, Piers Morgan. When he left for the Mirror, his replacement, Phil Hall, viewed her as something of a threat and was delighted when she was switched to the Sun. Similarly, Stuart Higgins resented the fact that she was wished on him, worrying about her closeness to management. Yelland's relations with her have been distinctly frosty. </p> <p>Wade's strength shows in that she was allowed to appoint her own deputy, Andy Coulson, the former Sun assistant editor and showbusiness columnist, who has been working on an internet project for the last year. They will make, says a rival editor, a formidable team. Their knowledge of the celebrity circuit will certainly help, though the NoW is regarded with terror by stars and their agents. </p> <p>And there lies the central problem for Wade. How can she raise sales unless she is prepared to take the NoW back to basics, risking the wrath of the showbusiness world, politicians and the PCC? It is known that she would like to emulate Morgan's NoW editorship, when he stopped the sales rot with a run of high-profile stories that were popular with readers but attracted odium from the establishment and, on occasion, from commentators such as me. </p> <p>Hall, though more cautious than Morgan, also suffered from complaints, including a recent PCC adjudication that appears to offer some protection to stars who suffer from kiss-and-tell stories. For Wade, to return to the Morgan agenda will be fraught with difficulties. Apart from the PCC's vigilance, and a new willingness of celebrities to use it, judges and juries have taken a dim view of evidence obtained through NoW investigations, leading to acquittals for several celebrities \"exposed\" by the paper for alleged misdeeds. </p> <p>To avoid such problems, the paper has tended to concentrate its fire on small-time examples of sex-for-sale operations, trying to overcome the sordid nature of the stories by adopting a humorous approach - which has usually been less than amusing. Though the superbly executed exposure of Jeffrey Archer's fake libel case alibi was a fine example of the formidable investigations team, there have been few revelations about misbehaviour by celebrities and politicians. </p> <p>If Wade encourages her reporters to return to these targets she will need all her networking skills to maintain her friendships with people such as Tony and Cherie Blair. They are not as close as some papers suggested last week, but they get along well. </p> <p>Her personal life may suffer too. Her relationship with former EastEnders actor Ross Kemp, and his showbiz friends, will be strained if the News of the World rampages through the bedrooms of the famous once again. It's unlikely that Wade will worry unduly. She still wants, more than anything else, to edit the Sun. This job could be her stepping stone to that job, or the end of a brilliant career. So, if you're famous and you're up to no good, watch out, Rebekah Wade's about! </p> <p><strong>All the way to the top of the world - Rebekah Wade</strong><br>Carolyne Ellis<br></p> <p><strong> Age</strong> 31 </p> <p><strong> Education:</strong> Did A-levels at a Cheshire grammar school, then headed to Paris and a job on Architecture Aujourd'hui magazine. Stayed in Paris until 1988. </p> <p><strong> Early career:</strong> Holiday job at Eddie Shah's Messenger Group in Warrington; editorial assistant on Shah's former north-west tabloid, the Post; one year journalism course at the London College of Printing. </p> <p><strong> The News International ladder:</strong> Joins News of the World in 1989, working up from features writer to features editor (Sunday magazine) to assistant editor and finally deputy editor. Nine years after joining the company, Rupert Murdoch moves her to the Sun as deputy editor in 1998 - under first Stuart Higgins and then David Yelland. </p> <p><strong> Reaches the top:</strong> Appointed editor of News of the World, its third female editor, in May 2000. </p> <p><strong> Private life</strong> Engaged to Ross Kemp, ex-EastEnders star, after four-year relationship.</p> <p><strong>Hall of shame:</strong><br><strong> September 1995: </strong> Phil Hall, deputy editor of News of the World, becomes editor, following Piers Morgan's departure to the Mirror. Three revelations swiftly appear - a judge's \"Drugs and sex romp with jailbird hookers\", Princess Diana's three trysts with Will Carling (\"Will and Di at it again\") and \"Star Emma [Thompson]'s Secret Nights with Movie Hunk\". </p> <p><strong> December 1995:</strong> Nine days after her BBC Panorama interview, Princess Diana phones up NoW royal reporter Clive Goodman. \"An historic first-ever newspaper interview,\" trumpets the paper. </p> <p><strong> August 1996: </strong> Furore greets a deal between NoW and prospective mum Mandy Allwood - dependent on number of babies born. According to Hall: \"We've agreed a sum of money should she give birth to eight children and we've agreed to discuss the situation with her should it change.\" </p> <p><strong> May 1997:</strong> Tory MP Jerry Hayes loses his Harlow seat, four months after the NoW's \"Tory MP two-timed wife with under-age gay lover\" allegations. </p> <p><strong> March 1998:</strong> Newcastle Utd directors Freddie Shepherd and Douglas Hall are taped mocking fans, Geordie women and Alan Shearer. Mazher Mahmood, the paper's investigations editor, is the controversial hit-man. Celebrity scalps succumbing to the NoW's \"cocaine sting\" this year include: Richard Bacon (fired from presenting Blue Peter), DJ Johnnie Walker (suspended from Radio 2) and ex-England rugby captain Lawrence Dallaglio (fined \u00a315,000 for bringing the game into disrepute). </p> <p><strong> September 1999:</strong> A lenient sentence is passed on the Earl of Hardwicke after a judge accepted that had he not been entrapped into taking cocaine he would not have committed the offence. The paper replied it was exposing \"one of the greatest social evils in Britain\". John Alford, from TV's London's Burning, was jailed earlier in the year - another victim of the \"cocaine sting\". </p> <p><strong> November 1999:</strong> \"Archer quits as News of the World exposes false alibi\". Twelve years after its original allegations about Jeffrey Archer and Monica Coghlan, the paper confronts Archer with a statement by a friend revealing he had agreed to lie for Archer in court. Archer admits all, adding that Ted Francis's decision \"to profit by selling his story\" to the NoW has saddened him. </p> <p><strong> December 1999: </strong> The NoW's \u00a325,000 \"conviction bonus\" to the key witness against Gary Glitter is ruled unacceptable by the PCC and called \"a clearly reprehensible state of affairs\" by the judge. Glitter was cleared of under-age indecent assault in November (but jailed for four months for child pornography offences). Alison Brown, the jury was told, was paid \u00a310,000 by the paper for the story that prompted the case and \"stands to make another \u00a325,000 if you convict the defendant on any of the charges\". </p> <p><strong> April 2000:</strong> A landmark adjudication by the PCC finds the NoW guilty of intruding on Coronation Street star Jacqueline Pirie's privacy, possibly signalling the demise of the kiss'n'tell staple. Its \"Street star's eight-month marathon of lust\" story breached clause three of the editors' code of practice: \"Everyone is entitled to his or her private and family life.\" </p> <p><strong> May 2000: </strong> Hall is replaced by Rebekah Wade.</p>",

Celebrity scalps succumbing to the NoW's \"cocaine sting\" this year include: Richard Bacon (fired from presenting Blue Peter), DJ Johnnie Walker (suspended from Radio 2) and ex-England rugby captain Lawrence Dallaglio (fined \u00a315,000 for bringing the game into disrepute). September 1999: A lenient sentence is passed on the Earl of Hardwicke after a judge accepted that had he not been entrapped into taking cocaine he would not have committed the offence. The paper replied it was exposing \"one of the greatest social evils in Britain\". John Alford, from TV's London's Burning, was jailed earlier in the year - another victim of the \"cocaine sting\". November 1999: \"Archer quits as News of the World exposes false alibi\". Twelve years after its original allegations about Jeffrey Archer and Monica Coghlan, the paper confronts Archer with a statement by a friend revealing he had agreed to lie for Archer in court. Archer admits all, adding that Ted Francis's decision \"to profit by selling his story\" to the NoW has saddened him. December 1999: The NoW's \u00a325,000 \"conviction bonus\" to the key witness against Gary Glitter is ruled unacceptable by the PCC and called \"a clearly reprehensible state of affairs\" by the judge. Glitter was cleared of under-age indecent assault in November (but jailed for four months for child pornography offences). Alison Brown, the jury was told, was paid \u00a310,000 by the paper for the story that prompted the case and \"stands to make another \u00a325,000 if you convict the defendant on any of the charges\". April 2000: A landmark adjudication by the PCC finds the NoW guilty of intruding on Coronation Street star Jacqueline Pirie's privacy, possibly signalling the demise of the kiss'n'tell staple. Its \"Street star's eight-month marathon of lust\" story breached clause three of the editors' code of practice: \"Everyone is entitled to his or her private and family life.\" May 2000: Hall is replaced by Rebekah Wade.",

It's called the Bush \"Debate Duck\" and it calculates \"how long George W Bush has managed to bob and weave away from debating Al Gore\". As I write, the clock reads 75 days, 11 hours, 38 mins and 3 seconds.</p> <p>Gore has been pressing for twice-weekly televised debates since the end of the primary season in March. Well, he would, wouldn't he? He is the champ when it comes to arguing policy. He doesn't float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. He just belts contenders into oblivion. The Rhodes scholar Bill Bradley could not stand the solar plexus punches in the Democratic primary; Ross Perot's jug ears have been on permanent wilt since Gore clobbered him for hypocrisy in a debate on the North American Free Trade Area. The Gore campaign people see Bush as a man who leads with a glass chin. Certainly he has displayed a talent for gaffes on issues much simpler than the calculations of the social security budget for the next couple of decades.</p> <p>But Bush is an artful dodger. The latest spin from the Bush camp, which got them the headline \"Bush Talking of Early Debate,\" was that his campaign managers are kicking round the possibility of a couple of \"early\" debates - which, when you read the fine print, means late August or early September; well, let's say October, shall we... well, anyway, sometime assuredly before the voting in November?</p> <p>The prevarications have been cleverly crafted so as not to let people conclude GW is a wimp, and so far they have not aroused any negative reaction. \"I want to be president\" is not yet up there in people's minds with \"I want to be a millionaire\". Bush can probably spin it out through the party conventions in August. In the meantime, while affecting insouciance, he is doggedly watching videotapes of Gore in debate, and the New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg is in dialectical training as a sparring partner.</p> <p>The Democrats, in fact, would be well advised not to cry \"chicken\" too much. The Republicans are playing another game. It's called expectations. The more the Gore campaign pushes, the more the public will expect to see him emerge as a combination of Mohammed Ali and Demosthenes. Bush has only to be seen standing upright after 15 rounds to be declared a genius.</p> <p>Bush is good at playing a crowd.

      "bodyText": "There is a clock ticking on Al Gore's website (www.gore2000.org/.) It's called the Bush \"Debate Duck\" and it calculates \"how long George W Bush has managed to bob and weave away from debating Al Gore\". As I write, the clock reads 75 days, 11 hours, 38 mins and 3 seconds. Gore has been pressing for twice-weekly televised debates since the end of the primary season in March. Well, he would, wouldn't he? He is the champ when it comes to arguing policy. He doesn't float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. He just belts contenders into oblivion. The Rhodes scholar Bill Bradley could not stand the solar plexus punches in the Democratic primary; Ross Perot's jug ears have been on permanent wilt since Gore clobbered him for hypocrisy in a debate on the North American Free Trade Area. The Gore campaign people see Bush as a man who leads with a glass chin. Certainly he has displayed a talent for gaffes on issues much simpler than the calculations of the social security budget for the next couple of decades. But Bush is an artful dodger. The latest spin from the Bush camp, which got them the headline \"Bush Talking of Early Debate,\" was that his campaign managers are kicking round the possibility of a couple of \"early\" debates - which, when you read the fine print, means late August or early September; well, let's say October, shall we... well, anyway, sometime assuredly before the voting in November? The prevarications have been cleverly crafted so as not to let people conclude GW is a wimp, and so far they have not aroused any negative reaction. \"I want to be president\" is not yet up there in people's minds with \"I want to be a millionaire\". Bush can probably spin it out through the party conventions in August. In the meantime, while affecting insouciance, he is doggedly watching videotapes of Gore in debate, and the New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg is in dialectical training as a sparring partner. The Democrats, in fact, would be well advised not to cry \"chicken\" too much. The Republicans are playing another game. It's called expectations. The more the Gore campaign pushes, the more the public will expect to see him emerge as a combination of Mohammed Ali and Demosthenes. Bush has only to be seen standing upright after 15 rounds to be declared a genius. Bush is good at playing a crowd. There will be a natural sympathy for the intellectual underdog, provided he does not whine. It worked for the recent one-on-one with Barbara Walters. It was supposed to be an ordeal for him, up against television's most unblinking ferret, but he emerged as a charming moderate.

I got my first wicket against Middlesex at Lord's earlier this month - Mark Ramprakash - and then I relaxed into my bowling. </p> <p>\"At Northampton for this match [the return Championship game against Middlesex], the pitch was fairly flat, but the ball did a little bit off the seam because it was quite damp. It was a pretty good toss to lose really. I was feeling a bit rusty before this game, because there had been lots of rain so I hadn't had any nets. I had a bad start when my first two overs went for 16, but then I got Owais Shah - lbw - in my third or fourth over and started bowling a lot better. I played with Owais in the Under-19 World Cup side - and it is always nice to get one of your mates out, especially as they always try a bit harder against you. I also got Robin Weston lbw. The ball swung away a little bit and he played across it. </p> <p>\"After lunch I got Ramps [Middlesex's top scorer, with 54] again, another lbw. John Hampshire gave them all - they were pretty adjacent. I think you know when they are definitely out or not. These ones were. The ball to Ramprakash probably held up before nipping back a bit. When you are bowling against someone like Ramps you can try too hard. But you have to back your ability. I know it is a clich\u00e9 but it is true that it only takes one ball to get a wicket. I'd bowled pretty well at him and Justin Langer at Lord's and that gave me confidence. It is nice to bowl to a top player - a more satisfying challenge.</p> <p> \"The fourth wicket was Ben Hutton. I'd just bowled two real four-balls, but the next one nipped across him. He nicked it and David Sales caught it at first slip. David is one of our best fielders. He started fielding at slip last year, caught a few great catches and has made the position his own. </p> <p>\"The fifth wicket was [Phil] Tufnell. They'd put on 20-odd for the last wicket and had edged a couple of fours. Graeme Swann dropped a catch off me at gully, and I didn't think it was going to be my day, but then Tuffers got a top edge and Mal Loye caught it at third man.</p> <p>\"It was my first first-class 'five-fer', though I got a couple in the second team last year.

When others drawl on about wrestling with crocodiles, killing wild boars with their bare hands and bungee jumping from the top the Niagara Falls, the man who has ridden a scooter in Naples has only to say, in a quite voice, \"I have ridden a scooter in Naples,\" and, if they have any sense, those other thrill seekers will look at him with awe. I am one such man. </p> <p>For a number of years I had dreamed of riding a scooter the length of Italy, from south to north, to write a contemporary portrait of how Italians cook and eat. The slower I moved, I reasoned, the more I would see and eat. The only trouble was that I had never ridden one. However, I decided that it's never, even at 53, too late to learn, and I apprenticed myself to Passmasters. </p> <p>It is no fault of theirs that I failed my full test when the time came. I had been tutored with careful rapture by Richard and Graham (I say rapture because bike instructors live in a parallel universe of leathers, speed and mechanical obsession), but on a bitterly cold day, when I was frozen to the very marrow, the uncompromising ex-police motorcyclist who was testing me gave me the thumbs down, principally for failing to maintain \"sufficient forward momentum\". In other words, I wasn't going fast enough. He did not seem to be a man who would be open to the argument that I wanted to go as slowly as possible. </p> <p>But I didn't need a full test in Italy to ride anything up to 125cc. The Italian authorities seem to believe that Italians have technical riding skills inborn, and so there's no need for anything so mundane as tests, and who is to say that they are wrong? So, helmet, biker jacket, shades and helmet - yes, even Italians have to wear helmets these days - to hand, I set about getting hold of a scooter in Italy, not wishing to spend half a lifetime riding out there. </p> <p>It wasn't as easy as I had thought. There don't appear to be any scooter hire agencies in southern Italy, where I was going to begin my meandering idyll. In the end, in Rome, I hired an elegant, cream coloured Vespa of all of 50cc from the charmingly named Bici e Baci (Bikes &amp; Kisses) and had it transported down to Reggio di Calabria. </p> <p>So it was, one sunny morning in April, that I collected Ginger, as it became known (the noise it made suggested a state continuous high-pitched excitement that reminded me of Chris Evans), and off I set, bag of essentials jammed between my knees, bag containing laptop slung over shoulder, awash with nervous sweat, and with a fine sense of heightened awareness </p> <p>There are things that can be said concerning the treacherous nature of road surfaces in Italy, of the extraordinary frequency with which crucial road signs appear to have been attacked by a maniac with a hammer. You may talk of the habit of closing all petrol stations on public holidays, which can pose logistical problems if your tank only hold 100kms' worth. But I will not hear a word of criticism against the southern road user. They were, without exception, the most considerate, gracious, best mannered I have every come across. </p> <p>All right, they may have been well advised to give a wide berth to a portly, evidently non-Italian pottering along none too certainly on a Vespa. Nevertheless, I never witnessed a single episode of road rage, bad driving or loss of temper despite conditions that would have lead to blood on the streets in the UK. </p> <p>That was until I hit Naples. </p> <p>How can such an experience be described? There is something of the chariot race in Ben Hur about it, and something of the intergalactic battles in Star Wars. </p> <p>Vehicles come at you from all angles, all the time. There is a general suicidal recklessness. Cars stop without warning, start without warning, pull out without warning, reverse from hidden back alleys into your path without warning. Traffic roars, leaps, hoots, toots, peals away, converges, moves in all directions at once with a terrible intensity. </p> <p>Streets that are wide enough for a single lane have two. Streets converge, each delivering a stream of traffic into the path of the other, each stream determined to establish right of passage by force majeure. </p> <p>Traffic lights? Of course there are traffic lights. Traffic lights are for decoration. Thery are to be gone through, whatever their colour, by guile of brute force. </p> <p>And through all this mechanised chaos weave the scooters at desperate speeds, one or two people perched on their backs, the rider chatting over his shoulder, waving to a friend, stopping for a few words - then scooting off again, from nought to 60 in three yards. </p> <p>This traffic is a metaphor for life in Naples in general. But don't they know that there is something amiss in this brilliant, nervous, finely tuned mechanised orchestra. Don't they know that there's someone who doesn't know the rules, who does not dare to blink in case he misses the end of his life, who has never ridden a scooter over cobbles before? </p> <p>Cobbles; the cobbles of Naples are an encyclopedia of tests of technique and nerve in themselves. Some are large and square, never regular, never set at the same height. They deliver a sequence of bone-shuddering crashes through the suspension of your scooter to your body. </p> <p> Some are small, rounder, even more irregular, lying at odd angles to each other. The scooter leaps, bucks and skids all in the same second. The handlebars twist this way and that. The back wheel slides away from beneath you. At the same moment, in the corner of your eye you notice something streaking up on your inside, register a woman with a baby in a pushchair half on, half off the pavement, talking to someone on the other side the road. You notice these things despite the fact that your head is nodding at incredible speed in tune with your progress over the cobbles. </p> <p>Which way? This street or that? Decisions need to be made in an instant. And decisions made in the instant have an uncanny way of being wrong. In these instants a rider lives several lifetimes, develops hair-trigger reactions and gains a highly developed sense of self-preservation. He finds resolution in the face of imminent disaster and achieves a kind transcendental tranquillity that only the greatest masters of Buddhism achieve after decades of meditation, when your mind is emptied of everything except here, now, this second . . . whoops, didn't see you coming. No offence. </p> <p>No offence is taken. This is all part of the mayhem of rush hour in Naples. People are kindly. They don't swear or rage. They don't confront or abuse. No one is stationary long enough for such pointless pursuits. No one is going to waste energy on anger when all energy has to be concentrated on moving, forwards, sideways, backwards, whichever - just so long as it's moving. </p> <p>Yes, I tell you, when a man has ridden a scooter in Naples, he has no need to boast.</p> <p>\u0095 Matthew Fort is the Guardian's food editor</p>",

Don't they know that there's someone who doesn't know the rules, who does not dare to blink in case he misses the end of his life, who has never ridden a scooter over cobbles before? Cobbles; the cobbles of Naples are an encyclopedia of tests of technique and nerve in themselves. Some are large and square, never regular, never set at the same height. They deliver a sequence of bone-shuddering crashes through the suspension of your scooter to your body. Some are small, rounder, even more irregular, lying at odd angles to each other. The scooter leaps, bucks and skids all in the same second. The handlebars twist this way and that. The back wheel slides away from beneath you. At the same moment, in the corner of your eye you notice something streaking up on your inside, register a woman with a baby in a pushchair half on, half off the pavement, talking to someone on the other side the road. You notice these things despite the fact that your head is nodding at incredible speed in tune with your progress over the cobbles. Which way? This street or that? Decisions need to be made in an instant. And decisions made in the instant have an uncanny way of being wrong. In these instants a rider lives several lifetimes, develops hair-trigger reactions and gains a highly developed sense of self-preservation. He finds resolution in the face of imminent disaster and achieves a kind transcendental tranquillity that only the greatest masters of Buddhism achieve after decades of meditation, when your mind is emptied of everything except here, now, this second . . . whoops, didn't see you coming. No offence. No offence is taken. This is all part of the mayhem of rush hour in Naples. People are kindly. They don't swear or rage. They don't confront or abuse. No one is stationary long enough for such pointless pursuits. No one is going to waste energy on anger when all energy has to be concentrated on moving, forwards, sideways, backwards, whichever - just so long as it's moving. Yes, I tell you, when a man has ridden a scooter in Naples, he has no need to boast. \u0095 Matthew Fort is the Guardian's food editor",

If you're in a machine hurtling towards the edge of a precipice, of course you want to stop it and get off. The question is whether globalisation can deliver on its promises or whether it is the sort of human, economic and environmental dead end that the \"stop the world\" clan say it is. </p> <p>Seattle and its aftermath have forced the supporters of globalisation into a crash re-think. For the first time in years, they have been obliged to find a positive justification for the way the world is heading, rather than simply repeat ad infinitum that there is no alternative. One such justification - and an elegant one at that - is the forthcoming book, A Future Perfect, written by two journalists on the Economist magazine, John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge. Its conclusion is that there are both pros and cons for globalisation, but that there are more pros than cons. \"Yes, it does increase inequality, but it does not create a winner-take-all society, and the winners hugely outnumber the losers. Yes, it leaves some people behind, but it helps millions more to leap ahead. Yes, it can make bad government worse, but the onus should be on crafting better government, not blaming globalisation. Yes, it curtails some of the power of nation states, but they remain the fundamental unit of modern politics. Globalisation is not destroying geography, merely enhancing it.\" </p> <p>But the economic benefits of globalisation are only half the story, say Micklethwait and Wooldridge. Globalisation has to be put in its proper political context - \"as an extension of the idea of liberty and as a chance to renew the fundamental rights of the individual.\" Globalisation has not - as some of its critics suggest - involved an exchange of master, with the faceless corporation replacing the faceless state, but instead is a force for personal liberation. </p> <p>This is an interesting turning of the tables, suggesting that if there is a Manichaean struggle between good and evil, we've all got it completely wrong. The globalisers are the hobbits not the dark lords, and the sooner those who care about the poor, the environment and human rights recognise the fact the better it will be for everyone. But especially, no doubt, for those who are already doing very nicely, thank you. </p> <p>Despite this attempt to hail the new golden dawn of globalisation, what seems to be happening is that the old politics is reasserting itself. Nature abhors a vacuum and a dirty great vacuum was left when communism was brought down by its own internal contradictions. That hole is now being filled, slowly and incoherently perhaps, by those groups railing against the way the world is being run. This would probably be happening even were globalisation running smoothly, but the process is being accelerated by the fact that the new world order has suffered some teething troubles. </p> <p>These look likely to persist. On Friday afternoon, for example, the dollar fell sharply against the euro on the foreign exchanges as dealers finally woke up to the idea that the party may be over on Wall Street. The correction in the euro-dollar rate has a lot further to go, with the possibility that we are on the brink of the climactic forex crisis of the past decade - that of the mighty greenback. With its massive current account deficit, its wild speculation in unproductive assets and its reliance on hot money from overseas, America resembles the economies of south-east Asia that went belly-up in 1997 and 1998. The difference, of course, is that the US accounts for around 25% of global gross domestic product. We could all be in for a very bumpy ride. </p> <p>But there is more to the backlash against globalisation than the gyrations of the financial markets.

As David Korten put it in his book, the Post Corporate World, the yoking together of objective science and corporate money has resulted in a system \"in which power and expertise are delinked from moral accountability, instrumental and financial values override life values, and what is expedient and profitable takes precedence over what is nurturing and responsible\". </p> <p>Scientists would strongly deny that any of this is true, but that, to a large extent, is irrelevant, because more and more people believe it to be true. </p> <p>In the end, life is not like Lord of the Rings, and we should be thankful for that.

But if science is now viewed with mistrust, markets with contempt and globalisation with trepidation, the fault lies not with those who have been protesting in Seattle and elsewhere but with those who, piece by piece, have dismantled the institutions that once underpinned the international system, ensured security for the weak as well as the strong, and helped save capitalism from itself. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\"> Larry Elliott</a></p>",

The incorporation of the European convention of human rights needs to acknowledge changes in the past 50 years in the rights of women, gays, and ethnic groups. What happens next ... Do you think Alan Travis has got it right - or is there more that should be done in the second term?

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There is an amazing online device that promises to deliver compelling advertisements straight to interested consumers, while leaving enough change in the adman's budget for a celebratory party or three. Direct marketeer pioneers have a name for this technology: email. </p> <p>Tired of boring banners and annoying interstitials (adverts which pop up and fill your screen while you are browsing the web), the advertising industry is turning back to email, the internet's oldest and best selling point. Through innovative ways of targeting newly sophisticated email ads, the industry hopes to take advantage of tantalising figures from Fletcher Research which show that 10% of permission-based email ads - where users have freely given away their email address to receive such promotions - are clicked on by consumers, compared to 0.5% of banner ads. </p> <p>First, they have to solve the stigma of unsolicited mail, or spam. A GarterGroup study found that 90% of US internet users are sent junk mail on a daily basis and, judging by the number of militant anti-spam sites there, many detest the unsolicited mail that clogs up their inboxes. Web-based email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo! have responded by setting up filters to allow users to sift out junk mail; people often establish multiple email accounts themselves to do the same. </p> <p>US businessman Sam Khuri tried email advertising the bad old way. Discarding every rule of respectable direct marketeers, he bombarded email addresses with messages promoting his company, Benchmark Printing, and ended up facing an array of court actions. In March, a US court convicted him of spamming BiblioTech, the first UK firm to take legal action against junk mail, and ordered him to pay undisclosed damages and $1,000 (\u00a3600) costs. </p> <p>There are more profitable ways of advertising and marketing via email. Some campaigns are sophisticated and subtle, such as the e-marketing of American Psycho in the US this spring. More than 40,000 people signed up to receive emails from its main character, Patrick Bateman, and also got to peep at emails he exchanged with his therapist. An email drama played out in their in-boxes and, rather like Freeserve's experiment with e-drama in the shape of Online Caroline, people were soon hooked. \"You can't not see the movie after that kind of involvement,\" says Tara Kole of Lions Gate Films. </p> <p>The obvious can work too. \"Email promotions are massive in the US,\" says Annie Millar, managing director of Manchester-based online marketeers xxist.com. US emailers enjoy scratch screen offers, in which they can run their mouse over an html email ad (a clickable email which opens up to look like a webpage) to see if they have won anything. \"It is instant gratification, instant win,\" says Millar. Such promotions capture information from customers in a step-by-step fashion as people can sign up for bigger competitions by giving away more information about their consumption habits. As Millar says: \"The more you give, the more you win. You are basically being paid to give information indirectly.\" </p> <p> All email advertisers need to do is ask. But in Britain they need to get their address books in order first. Millar fears that Europe's stringent, and largely untested, data protection laws mean that \"somebody is going to get their knuckles rapped big time in the UK. Some serious players have not sorted out their privacy issues. When you tell companies that they can't put two databases together, they look at you and shuffle in their seats a bit.\" In America, advertising company DoubleClick caused a storm of consumer protests after it was found piecing together different bits of data without users' consent, to build up secret consumer profiles. </p> <p>Opting in is the key for eGroups, a community email service with more than 14.8m members worldwide, which launched its UK website last month. Anyone with an email address can sign up for an interest group, one of which is networking group First Tuesday. Its members are sent all its eGroup emails and can use eGroups' facilities, including calendar services, file sharing, message archiving and online polling. In return, eGroups includes discreet html and text ads at the bottom of emails. EGroups offers \"very, very focused advertising\", capable of selling ad space that reaches specific audiences, says UK general manager Jerry Upshall. For instance, a wetsuit company would pay premium rates to insert an advert into emails exchanged by 5,000 snorkelling enthusiasts. </p> <p>\"There are a couple of rules you have to respect,\" cautions Upshall. \"First, don't send anything to a user that they don't want. And even when you do have permission, be selective. Is an email once a day appropriate? Probably not, but once a week might be. If you expect users to receive these ads, you have to give them something in return. We are giving them a really powerful email group tool and our users love it, which is why we've grown so quickly in a year and a half. </p> <p>\"Email advertising is coming on to the radar screen in a big way,\" he continues. \"This is going to be the marketing tool of the next six months.\" As well as offering advertisers unrivalled opportunities to court their favourite targets, it also has financial benefits. In the current climate of insecurity, email advertising is reassuringly cheap for nervous online operations wanting to trim ad spends. </p> <p>Despite dot.com gloom, entrepreneurial siblings Roy and Eldar Tuvey are so confident of the success of their UK email advertising start-up that they have forsaken secure City jobs to launch Mailround.com, backed to the tune of $5m (\u00a33.03m) by venture capitalists Chase Episode 1. </p> <p>The Tuveys were inspired by old-fashioned franking on envelopes to devise a system whereby users - Mailrounders - download software which \"stamps\" all their email with html adverts. Users will then receive \"gold\", \"silver\" or \"bronze\" ratings, depending on the number of emails they send and the response rates the ads get. Based on the revenues Mailround generates, Mailrounders are rewarded with tokens exchangeable at six top retailers and a charity. </p> <p>Roy Tuvey believes that, like eGroups, it could grow exponentially after its launch in July. \"It is a viral marketing product. If someone becomes a Mailrounder they can chose when to accept ad stamps in the emails they send, so that important job application does not need to be adorned with an ad. Recipients of email from Mailrounders with the ads enclosed will be a click away from becoming Mailrounders themselves. If we get the customer proposition right, we can grow a very large user-base very quickly.\" </p> <p>\"From an advertiser's point of view we are offering something no website can offer,\" claims Tuvey. \"First, we guarantee a superior consumer attention. You are getting an email from a friend so you are guaranteed to open it and look at the stamp. Second is the targeting. A lot of websites talk a good game in terms of targeting but we are really built on a one-to-one marketing relationship with consumers. And the third thing is the new demographic. A lot of sites are very keen to grab people at their first point of entry into the internet, which is often email.\" </p> <p>Mailround has its doubters. \"I think it is viable for certain types of people, such as students. They'll do anything,\" says Annie Millar of xxist.com. \"But I don't think your average A or B users are going to be interested because little chunks of money aren't for them.

      "bodyText": "There is an amazing online device that promises to deliver compelling advertisements straight to interested consumers, while leaving enough change in the adman's budget for a celebratory party or three. Direct marketeer pioneers have a name for this technology: email. Tired of boring banners and annoying interstitials (adverts which pop up and fill your screen while you are browsing the web), the advertising industry is turning back to email, the internet's oldest and best selling point. Through innovative ways of targeting newly sophisticated email ads, the industry hopes to take advantage of tantalising figures from Fletcher Research which show that 10% of permission-based email ads - where users have freely given away their email address to receive such promotions - are clicked on by consumers, compared to 0.5% of banner ads. First, they have to solve the stigma of unsolicited mail, or spam. A GarterGroup study found that 90% of US internet users are sent junk mail on a daily basis and, judging by the number of militant anti-spam sites there, many detest the unsolicited mail that clogs up their inboxes. Web-based email services such as Hotmail and Yahoo! have responded by setting up filters to allow users to sift out junk mail; people often establish multiple email accounts themselves to do the same. US businessman Sam Khuri tried email advertising the bad old way. Discarding every rule of respectable direct marketeers, he bombarded email addresses with messages promoting his company, Benchmark Printing, and ended up facing an array of court actions. In March, a US court convicted him of spamming BiblioTech, the first UK firm to take legal action against junk mail, and ordered him to pay undisclosed damages and $1,000 (\u00a3600) costs. There are more profitable ways of advertising and marketing via email. Some campaigns are sophisticated and subtle, such as the e-marketing of American Psycho in the US this spring. More than 40,000 people signed up to receive emails from its main character, Patrick Bateman, and also got to peep at emails he exchanged with his therapist. An email drama played out in their in-boxes and, rather like Freeserve's experiment with e-drama in the shape of Online Caroline, people were soon hooked. \"You can't not see the movie after that kind of involvement,\" says Tara Kole of Lions Gate Films. The obvious can work too. \"Email promotions are massive in the US,\" says Annie Millar, managing director of Manchester-based online marketeers xxist.com. US emailers enjoy scratch screen offers, in which they can run their mouse over an html email ad (a clickable email which opens up to look like a webpage) to see if they have won anything. \"It is instant gratification, instant win,\" says Millar. Such promotions capture information from customers in a step-by-step fashion as people can sign up for bigger competitions by giving away more information about their consumption habits. As Millar says: \"The more you give, the more you win. You are basically being paid to give information indirectly.\" All email advertisers need to do is ask. But in Britain they need to get their address books in order first. Millar fears that Europe's stringent, and largely untested, data protection laws mean that \"somebody is going to get their knuckles rapped big time in the UK. Some serious players have not sorted out their privacy issues. When you tell companies that they can't put two databases together, they look at you and shuffle in their seats a bit.\" In America, advertising company DoubleClick caused a storm of consumer protests after it was found piecing together different bits of data without users' consent, to build up secret consumer profiles. Opting in is the key for eGroups, a community email service with more than 14.8m members worldwide, which launched its UK website last month. Anyone with an email address can sign up for an interest group, one of which is networking group First Tuesday. Its members are sent all its eGroup emails and can use eGroups' facilities, including calendar services, file sharing, message archiving and online polling. In return, eGroups includes discreet html and text ads at the bottom of emails. EGroups offers \"very, very focused advertising\", capable of selling ad space that reaches specific audiences, says UK general manager Jerry Upshall. For instance, a wetsuit company would pay premium rates to insert an advert into emails exchanged by 5,000 snorkelling enthusiasts. \"There are a couple of rules you have to respect,\" cautions Upshall. \"First, don't send anything to a user that they don't want. And even when you do have permission, be selective. Is an email once a day appropriate? Probably not, but once a week might be. If you expect users to receive these ads, you have to give them something in return. We are giving them a really powerful email group tool and our users love it, which is why we've grown so quickly in a year and a half. \"Email advertising is coming on to the radar screen in a big way,\" he continues. \"This is going to be the marketing tool of the next six months.\" As well as offering advertisers unrivalled opportunities to court their favourite targets, it also has financial benefits. In the current climate of insecurity, email advertising is reassuringly cheap for nervous online operations wanting to trim ad spends. Despite dot.com gloom, entrepreneurial siblings Roy and Eldar Tuvey are so confident of the success of their UK email advertising start-up that they have forsaken secure City jobs to launch Mailround.com, backed to the tune of $5m (\u00a33.03m) by venture capitalists Chase Episode 1. The Tuveys were inspired by old-fashioned franking on envelopes to devise a system whereby users - Mailrounders - download software which \"stamps\" all their email with html adverts. Users will then receive \"gold\", \"silver\" or \"bronze\" ratings, depending on the number of emails they send and the response rates the ads get. Based on the revenues Mailround generates, Mailrounders are rewarded with tokens exchangeable at six top retailers and a charity. Roy Tuvey believes that, like eGroups, it could grow exponentially after its launch in July. \"It is a viral marketing product. If someone becomes a Mailrounder they can chose when to accept ad stamps in the emails they send, so that important job application does not need to be adorned with an ad. Recipients of email from Mailrounders with the ads enclosed will be a click away from becoming Mailrounders themselves. If we get the customer proposition right, we can grow a very large user-base very quickly.\" \"From an advertiser's point of view we are offering something no website can offer,\" claims Tuvey. \"First, we guarantee a superior consumer attention. You are getting an email from a friend so you are guaranteed to open it and look at the stamp. Second is the targeting. A lot of websites talk a good game in terms of targeting but we are really built on a one-to-one marketing relationship with consumers. And the third thing is the new demographic. A lot of sites are very keen to grab people at their first point of entry into the internet, which is often email.\" Mailround has its doubters. \"I think it is viable for certain types of people, such as students. They'll do anything,\" says Annie Millar of xxist.com. \"But I don't think your average A or B users are going to be interested because little chunks of money aren't for them. They just want speed and information.\" Too much ad information, in over-complicated animated html emails which slow down many ordinary modem connections, is what direct marketeers are rightly wary of. But they also have to curb their desire to saturate the email ad arena. If they swamp consumers with email ads, no matter how funky the sell, or how juicy the reward, response rates will drop, just as people have wised up to the \"click here\" cunning of banner ads. Only by treading carefully will the marketeer-pioneers not destroy the goose that lays the golden email.",

The project, which was launched with Richard Branson's Virgin Trains, promised a high-speed link that would have seen tilting trains cutting journey times between London and Manchester to a little more than one and half hours. Railtrack now wants to pull out of part of the project and offer instead a cut-price version. The upgrade, the biggest rail improvement project in western Europe, was to come in two stages. The first, costing more than \u00a32bn, should be ready by 2002, and would allow the 70 tilting trains ordered by Virgin Trains to be used. But sources say Railtrack will not be able to complete the hi-tech signalling system - the centrepiece of the \u00a33bn second stage - by the target date of 2005. This will stop the new trains running at 140mph and could mean a loss of more than 40 high-speed services a day between London and Scotland and the north-west. Rising costs are blamed for the collapse of the second half of the project. The bill for the full west coast upgrade has doubled in less than two years to \u00a35.4bn for the 400-mile main line between London and Glasgow. Railtrack is prepared to offer Sir Richard Branson \u00a3250m in compensation because it cannot complete the project.

It will say later this week when it publishes its annual results - which will show little change from its profits of \u00a3428m last year - that it has not got sufficient funds to meet the escalating costs of the line.

That figure has now fallen to 29%, with a corresponding increase in the proportion describing themselves as \"quite happy\". The same proportion of people described themselves as \"unhappy\" in 1990 and 2000. Nevertheless, 83% of the population are still proud to be British and 66% are willing to fight for their country in the event of a major war. The poll also found that 62% of people believe in God, down from 76% in 1980, yet only 23% of people have attended a religious service in the past month - the same figure as a decade ago. Most people retain their faith in family values and the institution of marriage, al though there has been a move away from organised religion, with those regarding themselves as belonging to a particular religion falling from 58% in 1990 to 48% today, the Church of England suffering the biggest drop, from 40% in 1990 to 35%. About 27% described themselves as \"spiritual\", rather than \"religious\", with 25% believing in reincarnation and 55% in fate.

The only difference this time round is that most analysts believe the reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund in the aftermath of the last crisis would prevent total regional collapse this time if the bottom were to fall out of the Indonesian economy. </p> <p>The problem starts at the very top, with President Abdurrahman Wahid. Since taking office last October, following Indonesia's first democratic general election in 44 years, the half-blind Muslim cleric who is recovering from two recent strokes, has had an uneasy ride. </p> <p>He has proved himself to be an extremely skilled politician in that he has contained regional unrest to the point of ensuring the nation is not going to disintegrate, he has greatly reduced the political power of the armed forces and he has successfully marginalised political opponents such as General Wiranto. </p> <p>But his competence in these fields has only magnified his ineptitude in matters economic.

      "bodyText": "When Kwik Kian Gie, Indonesia's senior economics minister, blurted out in a recent interview \"if I were a foreign investor, I wouldn't come to Indonesia\", few people were shocked, except by his honesty in stating what everyone already knew. Foreigners have indeed been giving the sprawling archipelago of 17,500 islands a wide berth in recent months. \"People are not even testing the water at the moment,\" said investment adviser Ken Conboy of Control Risks Group. \"There is just too much going on that makes people uneasy.\" As in 1997 when south-east Asia's economies toppled like dominoes, there is already a contagious effect in neighbouring countries. The only difference this time round is that most analysts believe the reforms demanded by the International Monetary Fund in the aftermath of the last crisis would prevent total regional collapse this time if the bottom were to fall out of the Indonesian economy. The problem starts at the very top, with President Abdurrahman Wahid. Since taking office last October, following Indonesia's first democratic general election in 44 years, the half-blind Muslim cleric who is recovering from two recent strokes, has had an uneasy ride. He has proved himself to be an extremely skilled politician in that he has contained regional unrest to the point of ensuring the nation is not going to disintegrate, he has greatly reduced the political power of the armed forces and he has successfully marginalised political opponents such as General Wiranto. But his competence in these fields has only magnified his ineptitude in matters economic. Monetary reform initially dawdled along so slowly the IMF suspended its bail-out funding at the end of March. A new letter of intent has just been signed but there is no guarantee that the government will stick to it, particularly as the currency has fallen almost 15 % in the past month, making budget calculations meaningless. Mr Wahid has tried to compensate for his economic shortcomings by surrounding himself with myriad layers of advisers. In addition to his ministers he has at least four economic advisory committees.

That body was due to vote on re-entering devolved government with Sinn Fein a week ago.

Admittedly he has never offered the soaring rhetoric and vision deployed by the world's more starred peacemakers - but perhaps that was wise, given the sensibilities of the Unionist community. Instead, David Trimble has gritted his teeth and recommended compromise only as a means of exposing the bad faith of the enemy. That has been his style and it is not always appealing to outsiders; and yet the Ulster Unionist leader has taken a community which had made a semi-religion of stubbornness and led them toward compromise. For that he deserves credit.</p> <p>The detail is welcome, too. In order to win Saturday's razor-thin margin for a return to government, Mr Trimble might have made a battery of promises he could not keep or which might later have undermined the peace process. He did not do that. He established an internal party committee to keep an eye on IRA progress on decommissioning - but he did not set another deadline for IRA guns. He clearly learned from the experience of the last such demand, which led to the collapse of the executive in the first place, back in February. Nor did he raise Unionist expectations of a victory on the vexed question of the name of Northern Ireland's future police force. His deputy, John Taylor, waved a piece of paper which purported to be a British government promise to keep the name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. But Mr Trimble himself went in for no such gestures. The result is that the leader's weekend victory may be narrower than previous ones but, unlike them, it will not be a millstone around his neck. It does not commit him to an outcome he cannot achieve.</p> <p>What now? An immediate onus falls on to the IRA. They will be called upon soon to take their promised confidence building measure, by opening up several arms dumps to international inspection. The sooner arrangements are made for that, the better. For the speedier and more serious the process is, the more the Trimble-ites will be vindicated against the rejectionists. When it becomes clear that IRA guns are indeed being put beyond use, the Donaldson position will become increasingly irrelevant.</p> <p>A burden falls on the British government, too. It needs to play straight on Northern Ireland: the side-letters and side-promises of the past have brought only trouble. The old tactic, whereby an agreement is reached one day only to be undermined by a side arrangement with Unionism the next, should be dropped. In its place there needs to be a firm resolve. Take policing. The government asked Chris Patten's independent commission to make recommendations. It did so and one of them was a change of name for the RUC. If the government believes that Patten was right, as common sense and international opinion agrees it was, then it should implement it.

      "bodyText": "Israeli soldiers fired to disperse a crowd of Lebanese sightseers who had scaled a border fence at Metullah yesterday, injuring at least three people, in an encounter underlining the precarious nature of the calm along Israel's northern frontier. It was the third time in as many days that Israeli soldiers have fired to turn back a stream of Lebanese civilians visiting the border to gaze out at Metullah's red roofs and to taunt the troops sitting high above them in their sentry boxes. An Israeli military spokesman said three people were injured by ricocheting bullets. Other reports said the troops had fired rubber-coated bullets straight into the crowd. The Israeli government sealed the crossing at the weekend to keep its own civilians away from the fence and to defuse the potential for confrontation. The army has adopted new rules of engagement along the northern frontier, and is under orders to fire only if their lives are in danger. But the new rules do not seem to have been applied yesterday. \"What has been happening these few days is that these young guys want to look very brave and plant a Hizbullah flag on Israeli soil,\" the spokesman said. \"We have to show them that this is not a game. This is an international border.\" Some of the exchanges with the Israelis have been good-humoured, and marshals from Hizbullah, who are now master of Israel's abandoned security zone, have restrained the crowds . But with United Nations peacekeepers and Lebanese government troops yet to enter the vacuum left by Israel's hasty retreat, tension has been growing. Israel complained to the UN at the weekend about the potential for trouble on the border. While a UN team of cartographers has been deployed to ratify Israel's withdrawal to the international border, it is still too early for a fullscale UN force to be in place. There were also fears yesterday for the safety of Christians, and those with links to the South Lebanon Army after a Christian man was shot dead in Rmaish village. Despite widespread fears of reprisal, and the flight of 7,000 SLA troops and their families to Israel, the killing was the first since Hizbullah swept through the south. Despite the relatively minor incidents, Israel is hoping that these days of calm will gather momentum. \"In light of the delicate and fragile conditions in the area, every day that passes quietly contributes to the chances of stabilising the situation,\" the prime minister, Ehud Barak, said in a statement yesterday. However, a spokesman from his office denied press reports that Israel had quietly agreed an understanding with the Hizbullah guerrillas on the need for a ceasefire. A statement confirmed that the army had blown up two small outposts and a section of road near Shebaa farms in its occupation zone. However, Israel had no intention of yielding to Hizbullah demands to return the area, claiming that 90% of it was not part of Lebanon. \u0095 Israel's deputy prime minister resigned yesterday after being formally charged with sexual assault and harassment. Yitzhak Mordechai, who also served as transport minister, is accused of assaulting an employee of his ministry last February and two other women during his days as an army officer.",

This is a flavour that began to emerge with the appointment of the former KGB colonel as prime minister last August, which is becoming more powerful with every week that he presides over the Kremlin.</p> <p>Again and again as he takes his first steps in political life, Putin has made a show of drawing on nostalgic themes from Russia's totalitarian past. He has made no secret of his fondness for the KGB, where he spent 16 years, and has paid tribute to those who presided over the security force's harshest clampdowns on Russia's dissident society.</p> <p>Last year, he restored a plaque to former president and KGB leader Yury Andropov on the walls of the Lubyanka (ripped down with the reforms of the 90s). Recently, he unveiled another plaque honouring Russia's war heroes - with Stalin's name listed first. A commemorative coin decorated with Stalin's face has been issued and there are plans to install a new bust of the Soviet tyrant at Russia's main war memorial.</p> <p>Putin is a modern politician - acutely sensitive to image and presentation - and these symbolic tributes to authoritarianism are made for calculated effect. The chaos and humiliations of Russia's decade of reforms left the population with a thirst for a strong leader capable of imposing order. Putin shrewdly built his appeal around a promise to restore stability, promising to crack down on corruption, crime and economic disarray.</p> <p>But Russia's liberals - horrified by the country's new iconography - are wondering what else he plans to subject to a crackdown, anxious to establish whether this authoritarian streak runs deeper than mere symbolism.</p> <p>When a band of former Soviet dissidents declared in February that Putinism was nothing short of modernised Stalinism, they were widely dismissed as hysterical prophets of doom. \"Authoritarianism is growing harsher, society is being militarised, the military budget is increasing,\" they warned, before calling on the West to \"re-examine its attitude towards the Kremlin leadership, to cease indulging it in its barbaric actions, its dismantlement of democracy and suppression of human rights.\"</p> <p>In the light of Putin's actions during his first days in power, their warnings have gained an uneasy new resonance.</p> <p>Putin's first steps - his structural political reforms, his government's handling of the press, his attitude towards democratic freedoms - all seem to indicate a step away from Russia's nascent democracy in a more repressive direction.</p> <p>It is now three weeks since he was officially inaugurated and already his much-scrutinised enigma appears to be fading. While he has yet to announce any coherent plans to reinvigorate Russia's economy, or to improve life for its impoverished population - a third of whom live beneath the official poverty line - the new president has already set an apparently authoritarian seal on the future style of government.</p> <p>It looks probable that his liberal inclinations, which he made much of to selected audiences before his election, will be restricted to economic reforms rather than to guiding his broader political aspirations.</p> <p>Determined to grab power back from the country's rebellious regions, last week Putin carved up Russia into seven slices and appointed seven new presidential representatives.</p> <p>These appointments are a stark portent of the future. Responsibility for Russia's north-western districts was entrusted to the sinister figure of Victor Cherkesov - deputy director of the FSB, the reorganised KGB - a man feared and hated by Russia's liberal population. In the 1970s and 1980s, Cherkesov was responsible for surveillance of the media and trade unions and enthusiastically pursued intellectual opponents of the Soviet regime.</p> <p>The country's central region was given to another former KGB apparatchik, General Georgy Poltavchenko, while the Urals region was handed to a senior figure in the police force, General Pyotr Latyshev. The Caucasus region - where Russia's brutal war against Chechen rebels drags on - was allocated to one of the toughest generals behind the campaign, General Viktor Kazantsev, the man jointly responsible for the thousands of civilian deaths in the region. Only two of the seven districts are to be headed by civilian figures.</p> <p>This elevation of former KGB men to important government positions continues a trend started last autumn. And a further hint of the role old KGB tactics could play in Putin's new Russia emerged this month with the publication of a leaked Kremlin strategy document, advising Putin to establish a new FSB-run \"presidential political directorate\" - to strengthen the president's power.</p> <p>The body would gather dirt on opposition figures, and would whip the press into submission. \"Opposition media should be driven to financial crisis, their licences and certificates withdrawn and conditions created where the work of every single opposition medium is either controllable or impossible,\" the document stated.</p> <p>A media crackdown is already well under way. Ten days ago, more than 2,000 people - including the leading lights of Russia's media elite - gathered in central Moscow to protest against severe press restrictions exerted under Putin.</p> <p>\"It has become hard for journalists to breathe,\" the editor of the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets declared.</p> <p>The mysterious, spurious tax raid on MediaMost, Russia's largest inde pendent media empire - which has been consistently critical of Putin's new regime - precipitated the final surge of alarm.</p> <p>In the clear daylight of a cold May afternoon - just four days after Putin's inauguration - some 40 machine gun-wielding government security agents in black balaclavas and camouflage gear stormed their way into MediaMost's Moscow offices. The paramilitaries left several hours later, confiscating tapes and transcripts. Journalists working for MediaMost's leading daily newspaper, Sevodnya, and its | popular television station, NTV, saw the attack as an attempt to intimidate their dissenting voices into conformity.</p> <p>Sevodnya's editor, Mikhail Berger, said that Putin's approach towards the press was strongly reminiscent of the Soviet era. \"Putin has divided the media into two categories - those organisations that give him total, utter, unquestioning support and those that don't. He views the latter not simply as papers or television companies, but as enemy units which he has to fight,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Under the Soviet Union, everything was categorised either as Soviet or anti-Soviet. Now under Putin, everything is either state or anti-state. MediaMost has been repeatedly accused by the Kremlin of having an 'anti-state' position. In terms of press freedoms, I think we could see a swift return to the Soviet Union, not just to the 70s, but the 40s under Stalin.\"</p> <p>Protesters returned to the streets last Friday to campaign against the forced sale of the broadcast licence of another television company, TV Centre, which has been consistently critical of the Kremlin.</p> <p>This drive to stifle Russia's newly independent media began last autumn. Putin was determined to crack down on press coverage of his battle in Chechnya - to avoid the critical reports (and resulting public disillusionment) which plagued the government during the last war.</p> <p>More troubling still is the role Russia's state-controlled media played in helping Putin ascend to power. Brazen manipulation of Russia's two nationwide television stations (with the collusion of their part-owner, Russia's oligarch supremo Boris Berezovsky) led to the political destruction of Putin's two serious presidential rivals - Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov and former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov. In a vicious smear campaign, prime-time broadcasts portrayed Luzhkov as a corrupt murderer, and Primakov as a frail has-been. Putin's own ratings soared from 2% to 53%.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the same television stations, ORT and RTR, helped promote a new pro-Putin political grouping - Unity, also known as Medved, the Bear. Like Putin, the faction rose to victory from nowhere, without ever pausing to detail its political intentions. Gradually, in the months since the election, Russia has seen its once-strong political opposition melt away, with even the once- intractable communists ready to compromise with the new order.</p> <p>A deeper unease lurks in the minds of those dismayed by the neo-Soviet tendencies in Putin's new Russia - overshadowing everything else by its potential monstrosity. The memory of the unresolved September spate of apartment block bombings continues to unnerve those who question the official line that the attacks were orchestrated by Chechen terrorists.</p> <p>The theory that the horrific attacks - in which almost 200 civilians were crushed to death - could have been an FSB ploy designed to drum up support for the Chechen war and thus aid the elevation of Putin to power, continues to be debated, although there is no more evidence for this version of events than for the terrorist scenario.</p> <p>\"Even thinking about the bombings chills my heart,\" Ludmila Alexeeva, president of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, said. \"I only know one thing - it was extremely unlikely to have been done by the Chechens; it just wasn't in their interests.\"</p> <p>Despite this oppressive multitude of foreboding signals, a sense of perspective has to be maintained. Although harassed, Russia's press remains at liberty to continue criticising the government; while Stalinist symbols have been resurrected, there is no evidence of any return to the horrors of Stalinist oppression.</p> <p>And even the extent of Putin's own power to indulge his authoritarian inclinations is still unknown. Eased into the Kremlin with the assistance of powerful behind-the-scenes tycoons from Yeltsin's camp, Putin remains at their mercy.</p> <p>Since his debut on the political arena, Putin has struggled to play to conflicting audiences - presenting himself as liberal reformer to the West, as the firm hand of law and order to his own people and as the preserver of continuity to the forces who helped him into power. It is conceivable that his recent actions were designed primarily for domestic consumption and could later be supplemented by a more liberal programme, when his administration finally resolves which direction Russia should take. Alongside the KGB heavies and the powerful businessmen who surround Putin, a small group of liberals remain - who have yet to prove how much influence they can wield.</p> <p>\"I still have no idea whether Putin wants to reintroduce Stalinism or go in the direction of democracy - because if you listen to him, he says first one thing and then the other,\" Alexeeva said. \"I don't think it's simply that we don't know what he stands for, I think he doesn't know either.\"</p>",

But Russia's liberals - horrified by the country's new iconography - are wondering what else he plans to subject to a crackdown, anxious to establish whether this authoritarian streak runs deeper than mere symbolism. When a band of former Soviet dissidents declared in February that Putinism was nothing short of modernised Stalinism, they were widely dismissed as hysterical prophets of doom. \"Authoritarianism is growing harsher, society is being militarised, the military budget is increasing,\" they warned, before calling on the West to \"re-examine its attitude towards the Kremlin leadership, to cease indulging it in its barbaric actions, its dismantlement of democracy and suppression of human rights.\" In the light of Putin's actions during his first days in power, their warnings have gained an uneasy new resonance. Putin's first steps - his structural political reforms, his government's handling of the press, his attitude towards democratic freedoms - all seem to indicate a step away from Russia's nascent democracy in a more repressive direction. It is now three weeks since he was officially inaugurated and already his much-scrutinised enigma appears to be fading. While he has yet to announce any coherent plans to reinvigorate Russia's economy, or to improve life for its impoverished population - a third of whom live beneath the official poverty line - the new president has already set an apparently authoritarian seal on the future style of government. It looks probable that his liberal inclinations, which he made much of to selected audiences before his election, will be restricted to economic reforms rather than to guiding his broader political aspirations. Determined to grab power back from the country's rebellious regions, last week Putin carved up Russia into seven slices and appointed seven new presidential representatives. These appointments are a stark portent of the future. Responsibility for Russia's north-western districts was entrusted to the sinister figure of Victor Cherkesov - deputy director of the FSB, the reorganised KGB - a man feared and hated by Russia's liberal population. In the 1970s and 1980s, Cherkesov was responsible for surveillance of the media and trade unions and enthusiastically pursued intellectual opponents of the Soviet regime. The country's central region was given to another former KGB apparatchik, General Georgy Poltavchenko, while the Urals region was handed to a senior figure in the police force, General Pyotr Latyshev. The Caucasus region - where Russia's brutal war against Chechen rebels drags on - was allocated to one of the toughest generals behind the campaign, General Viktor Kazantsev, the man jointly responsible for the thousands of civilian deaths in the region. Only two of the seven districts are to be headed by civilian figures. This elevation of former KGB men to important government positions continues a trend started last autumn. And a further hint of the role old KGB tactics could play in Putin's new Russia emerged this month with the publication of a leaked Kremlin strategy document, advising Putin to establish a new FSB-run \"presidential political directorate\" - to strengthen the president's power. The body would gather dirt on opposition figures, and would whip the press into submission. \"Opposition media should be driven to financial crisis, their licences and certificates withdrawn and conditions created where the work of every single opposition medium is either controllable or impossible,\" the document stated. A media crackdown is already well under way. Ten days ago, more than 2,000 people - including the leading lights of Russia's media elite - gathered in central Moscow to protest against severe press restrictions exerted under Putin. \"It has become hard for journalists to breathe,\" the editor of the daily Moskovsky Komsomolets declared. The mysterious, spurious tax raid on MediaMost, Russia's largest inde pendent media empire - which has been consistently critical of Putin's new regime - precipitated the final surge of alarm. In the clear daylight of a cold May afternoon - just four days after Putin's inauguration - some 40 machine gun-wielding government security agents in black balaclavas and camouflage gear stormed their way into MediaMost's Moscow offices. The paramilitaries left several hours later, confiscating tapes and transcripts. Journalists working for MediaMost's leading daily newspaper, Sevodnya, and its | popular television station, NTV, saw the attack as an attempt to intimidate their dissenting voices into conformity. Sevodnya's editor, Mikhail Berger, said that Putin's approach towards the press was strongly reminiscent of the Soviet era. \"Putin has divided the media into two categories - those organisations that give him total, utter, unquestioning support and those that don't. He views the latter not simply as papers or television companies, but as enemy units which he has to fight,\" he said. \"Under the Soviet Union, everything was categorised either as Soviet or anti-Soviet. Now under Putin, everything is either state or anti-state. MediaMost has been repeatedly accused by the Kremlin of having an 'anti-state' position. In terms of press freedoms, I think we could see a swift return to the Soviet Union, not just to the 70s, but the 40s under Stalin.\" Protesters returned to the streets last Friday to campaign against the forced sale of the broadcast licence of another television company, TV Centre, which has been consistently critical of the Kremlin. This drive to stifle Russia's newly independent media began last autumn. Putin was determined to crack down on press coverage of his battle in Chechnya - to avoid the critical reports (and resulting public disillusionment) which plagued the government during the last war. More troubling still is the role Russia's state-controlled media played in helping Putin ascend to power. Brazen manipulation of Russia's two nationwide television stations (with the collusion of their part-owner, Russia's oligarch supremo Boris Berezovsky) led to the political destruction of Putin's two serious presidential rivals - Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov and former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov. In a vicious smear campaign, prime-time broadcasts portrayed Luzhkov as a corrupt murderer, and Primakov as a frail has-been. Putin's own ratings soared from 2% to 53%. Meanwhile, the same television stations, ORT and RTR, helped promote a new pro-Putin political grouping - Unity, also known as Medved, the Bear. Like Putin, the faction rose to victory from nowhere, without ever pausing to detail its political intentions. Gradually, in the months since the election, Russia has seen its once-strong political opposition melt away, with even the once- intractable communists ready to compromise with the new order. A deeper unease lurks in the minds of those dismayed by the neo-Soviet tendencies in Putin's new Russia - overshadowing everything else by its potential monstrosity. The memory of the unresolved September spate of apartment block bombings continues to unnerve those who question the official line that the attacks were orchestrated by Chechen terrorists. The theory that the horrific attacks - in which almost 200 civilians were crushed to death - could have been an FSB ploy designed to drum up support for the Chechen war and thus aid the elevation of Putin to power, continues to be debated, although there is no more evidence for this version of events than for the terrorist scenario. \"Even thinking about the bombings chills my heart,\" Ludmila Alexeeva, president of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, said. \"I only know one thing - it was extremely unlikely to have been done by the Chechens; it just wasn't in their interests.\" Despite this oppressive multitude of foreboding signals, a sense of perspective has to be maintained. Although harassed, Russia's press remains at liberty to continue criticising the government; while Stalinist symbols have been resurrected, there is no evidence of any return to the horrors of Stalinist oppression. And even the extent of Putin's own power to indulge his authoritarian inclinations is still unknown. Eased into the Kremlin with the assistance of powerful behind-the-scenes tycoons from Yeltsin's camp, Putin remains at their mercy. Since his debut on the political arena, Putin has struggled to play to conflicting audiences - presenting himself as liberal reformer to the West, as the firm hand of law and order to his own people and as the preserver of continuity to the forces who helped him into power. It is conceivable that his recent actions were designed primarily for domestic consumption and could later be supplemented by a more liberal programme, when his administration finally resolves which direction Russia should take. Alongside the KGB heavies and the powerful businessmen who surround Putin, a small group of liberals remain - who have yet to prove how much influence they can wield. \"I still have no idea whether Putin wants to reintroduce Stalinism or go in the direction of democracy - because if you listen to him, he says first one thing and then the other,\" Alexeeva said. \"I don't think it's simply that we don't know what he stands for, I think he doesn't know either.\"",

His efforts finally paid off on Saturday when the Ulster Unionists voted to return to government with Sinn Fein, ending at a stroke a whispering campaign that the Prince of Darkness had lost his touch.</p> <p>The vote showed that the deft Mandelsonian skills, which played such a crucial role in establishing New Labour, had paid off in the infinitely more labyrinthine world of Northern Irish politics. Once again Mr Mandelson had been personally saved from disaster, no doubt allowing him to dream of stepping into his grandfather's shoes as a future foreign secretary.</p> <p>Any thoughts of another cabinet role are said to be a long way down the road, with government sources suggesting that Mr Mandelson will remain in Belfast to nurse devolution through its early stages. If the executive works success fully, then Mr Mandelson is expected to play an increasing role in Labour's general election planning, although he will be on call to return to the province at a moment's notice.</p> <p>The impending election battle with the Tories is likely to prove, for Mr Mandelson at least, more sedate than his ex perience in Northern Ireland. Over the past eight months both sides have launched vitriolic attacks on him, though the venom is currently coming from nationalists who believe that Mr Mandelson has tilted the balance too far in favour of Unionists. The latest issue of the Dublin current affairs magazine Magill contains a devastating attack on Mr Mandelson, saying that his tenure at Hillsborough owes more to the Raj than to 21st century Belfast.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson's friends, however, insist that he is fulfilling the brief he was given when Tony Blair despatched him to Belfast last autumn. His role was to restore confidence among Unionists, who had fallen out with Mo Mowlam, without losing the faith of nationalists.</p> <p>Friends say that Mr Mandelson has achieved this in the three crucial tests he has faced since coming to Belfast.</p> <p>Within weeks of his arrival, Mr Mandelson played a pivotal role in ensuring that Mr Trimble won his party's backing to form an administration with Sinn Fein ahead of IRA disarmament. In the run-up to the vote in November, Mr Mandelson sent a series of emollient signals to the Unionist community by praising the RUC and arranging for the force to be awarded the George Cross.</p> <p>The executive was formed, but less than two months later Mr Mandelson faced his most trying moment when Mr Trimble carried out his threat to pull the plug, claiming that the IRA had failed to abide by a commitment to disarm. In the face of opposition from Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Irish government, Mr Mandelson suspended the executive to ensure that it could be revived at a later date.</p> <p>His move, which delighted Unionists, horrified nationalists who felt that Mr Mandelson had caved into Unionist pressure.

      "bodyText": "With a wave of his hand Peter Mandelson leant back in his plush armchair and peremptorily interrupted his Unionist audience. \"Have you met Bobby,\" the Northern Ireland secretary enquired in a manner bordering on the regal. \"You must come out and see him.\" The Unionist delegation, who had been summoned to meet Mr Mandelson at his palatial residence at Hillsborough Castle soon after his arrival in the province, ignored the offer to meet his beloved golden retriever and returned to berating him. \"It was all a bit naff,\" one of the Unionists said. \"But you've got hand it to Mandelson - it was a classy way to shut us up.\" Bobby has less value as a prop these days, after the friendliness of Mr Mandelson's initial encounters with Northern Ireland's political leaders gave way to months of relentless hard bargaining. His efforts finally paid off on Saturday when the Ulster Unionists voted to return to government with Sinn Fein, ending at a stroke a whispering campaign that the Prince of Darkness had lost his touch. The vote showed that the deft Mandelsonian skills, which played such a crucial role in establishing New Labour, had paid off in the infinitely more labyrinthine world of Northern Irish politics. Once again Mr Mandelson had been personally saved from disaster, no doubt allowing him to dream of stepping into his grandfather's shoes as a future foreign secretary. Any thoughts of another cabinet role are said to be a long way down the road, with government sources suggesting that Mr Mandelson will remain in Belfast to nurse devolution through its early stages. If the executive works success fully, then Mr Mandelson is expected to play an increasing role in Labour's general election planning, although he will be on call to return to the province at a moment's notice. The impending election battle with the Tories is likely to prove, for Mr Mandelson at least, more sedate than his ex perience in Northern Ireland. Over the past eight months both sides have launched vitriolic attacks on him, though the venom is currently coming from nationalists who believe that Mr Mandelson has tilted the balance too far in favour of Unionists. The latest issue of the Dublin current affairs magazine Magill contains a devastating attack on Mr Mandelson, saying that his tenure at Hillsborough owes more to the Raj than to 21st century Belfast. Mr Mandelson's friends, however, insist that he is fulfilling the brief he was given when Tony Blair despatched him to Belfast last autumn. His role was to restore confidence among Unionists, who had fallen out with Mo Mowlam, without losing the faith of nationalists. Friends say that Mr Mandelson has achieved this in the three crucial tests he has faced since coming to Belfast. Within weeks of his arrival, Mr Mandelson played a pivotal role in ensuring that Mr Trimble won his party's backing to form an administration with Sinn Fein ahead of IRA disarmament. In the run-up to the vote in November, Mr Mandelson sent a series of emollient signals to the Unionist community by praising the RUC and arranging for the force to be awarded the George Cross. The executive was formed, but less than two months later Mr Mandelson faced his most trying moment when Mr Trimble carried out his threat to pull the plug, claiming that the IRA had failed to abide by a commitment to disarm. In the face of opposition from Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Irish government, Mr Mandelson suspended the executive to ensure that it could be revived at a later date. His move, which delighted Unionists, horrified nationalists who felt that Mr Mandelson had caved into Unionist pressure. The Irish government was so angry that the Dublin cabinet secretary was said to have interrupted the Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, during a telephone conversation with Mr Blair, to denounce Mr Mandelson. Sinn Fein and the SDLP are still smarting at the decision, although Mr Mandelson is now widely praised for his move. Kevin McNamara, the former Labour Northern Ireland spokesman who is sympathetic to nationalist thinking, said that the IRA's offer to open up its arms dumps had vindicated his decision. Although the executive is to be restored once again this week, the suspension in February has left a sour taste in the mouths of nationalists. In his third test - the imple mentation of the Patten report on police reforms - Mr Mandelson will have his work cut out to restore the faith of nationalists, without losing the Unionists. Nationalists have been outraged by a series of concessions to the Unionists over the police, which were designed to strengthen Mr Trimble's hand in the run up to Saturday's vote. Mr Mandelson responded to Unionist concerns by promising to keep alive the name of the RUC, which Mr Patten wanted to abolish, in the forthcoming legislation that will create the new police force. Government sources suggested yesterday that Mr Mandelson will reach out to nationalists by keeping an \"open mind\" to SDLP amendments to other areas of the policing bill when it reaches committee stage in the commons. One government source said that the reform of the RUC symbolised the delicate balancing act Mr Mandelson has tried to achieve. \"It is all about trying to create an equilibrium and navigating a good path between both sides,\" one source said. \"The aim is to include everybody's point of view to create an effective police force. But there is no point in creating a police service free from the shackles of the past which is then vulnerable to political intrusion.\" When Mr Trimble sits down again with Sinn Fein this week, Mr Mandelson will take a back seat as local leaders once again assume the reins of power. But Mr Mandelson will know that a crisis can blow up in Northern Ireland seemingly out of nowhere, with the potential to inflict serious political damage to the resident of Hillsborough Castle.",

      "bodyText": "Footballer John Fashanu yesterday revealed the guilt he felt about ignoring his brother Justin's last telephone call before he committed suicide. The former Wimbledon player and presenter of the television programme Gladiators said he was haunted by a call he received on his mobile phone the day before Justin, 37, was found hanging in a garage in Shoreditch, east London, in May 1998. At the time of his death newspapers wrongly reported there was a warrant out for his arrest in America for allegedly molesting a 17-year-old boy earlier that year. In a frank television interview with Esther Rantzen, Fashanu said he would always blame himself for his older brother's death because he thought he could have done more. \"Just before he committed suicide there was a telephone call to my mobile phone that night and the person wouldn't speak. I could hear breathing, I could feel that it was somebody from my family. \"I could feel that it was Justin, but I didn't reach out. I just put the phone down and thought: 'Oh, it's him again'. And of course the next day he committed suicide.\" In a suicide note, Justin Fashanu, the former England under-21 and Nottingham Forest player who in 1990 became the first professional footballer to come out as a homosexual, said he wanted to die rather than put his friends and family through any more unhappiness. Yesterday John Fashanu said he had not accepted Justin's sexuality, or how desperate his plight was, and the pair had not been on speaking terms for many years. \"Justin confessed that he was gay, and he was living in America at the time. I think that he had - no, we had - created a situation where we isolated him. I don't think that we had accepted that he was gay. When I say 'we', I am probably trying to protect myself. I am saying 'me'. \"And I think that what happened was there were allegations that Justin was involved with some problems in America which have been published in the newspapers, and I think that he panicked and could not take it any more, and thought that the best thing to save the family from embarrassment, which he had written in the suicide note, and he committed suicide. \"Sadly and unfortunately I was not on speaking terms with him at the time. Hindsight is a lovely word. I don't think I realised the depth of loneliness and despair that he was going through. I don't think that I really, in a selfish way, understood exactly what was going on. \"I think we are all scared of what we don't understand.\" The Fashanu brothers were both placed in a Barnado's home by their mother after their father left Britain to return to Nigeria. They grew up with a foster family in Attleborough, Norfolk, and were spotted as schoolboys by Norwich City scouts. Justin became the first \u00a31m black player but his career was cut short by a series of knee injuries. He moved to North America where he coached teams in the US and Canada.

No sooner have we completed a crusade in one corner of the globe, than New Labour is sending our boys off to sort out another messy, brutal war. There is a curious irony that the Labour party of the early 80s, so in love with pacifism and nuclear disarmament, has bequeathed us a government with probably the most interventionist record since the days of Palmerston's gunboat diplomacy. Much is made of this government slaying Labour's ghost of economic incompetence, but Tony Blair's slaughter of another ghost - Labour's hands-up defence policy - has been equally comprehensive.</p> <p>We are told that this country went into Sierra Leone because Blair thought it was \"morally the right thing to do\". Curious thing, this morality business of Blair's. We heard a lot about it during Kosovo, then all went quiet over Chechnya, and there wasn't a murmur about morality when the new military leaders in Pakistan wanted their next consignment of aircraft or Zimbabwe was due its instalment of spare parts to meddle in the Congo. Number 10 overruled the Foreign Office on both arms deals, for fear of undermining Britain's reputation as one of the world's biggest arms suppliers. When Putin needed a boost in his election campaign, Blair hotfooted it to St Petersburg to do business with a man who has pursued a war as vicious as any of those conducted by the west's pet hate figures, such as Milosevic or Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>Blair's \"morality\" is deeply pragmatic; that much even he admitted in his crucial Chicago speech in April 1999, when he was trying to persuade the US of the virtues of the Kosovo war. \"Our actions are guided by a more subtle blend of mutual self interest and moral purpose in defending the values we cherish.\" This kind of morality sounds like a brand of instant coffee. It also sounds like the kind of moral purpose with which Palmerston infused his gunboat diplomacy. Pax Britannica was supposed to bring peace and prosperity to the world. In reality, it brought a hugely lucrative drugs trade to Asia and constructed a global economic system which supplied Britain with plentiful, cheap raw materials and large markets for our manufactured goods. It was an ideology thinly veneering our often brutal economic exploitation.</p> <p>VS Naipaul describes this beautifully at the beginning of his novel A Bend In The River, when he compares the European traders on the east coast of Africa with the Indians and Arabs: \"The Europeans could do one thing and say something quite different; and they could act in this way because they had an idea of what they owed to their civilisation. It was their great advantage over us. The Europeans wanted gold and slaves, like everybody else; but at the same time they wanted statues put up to themselves as people who had done good things for the slaves... they got both the slaves and the statues.\"</p> <p>Our colonial past isn't just history. The British still use a moral narrative to explain and justify our position and power in the world. We want to feel good about ourselves, and so, on to the conveniently distant canvas of Africa, we can project a wonderful tale about our altruistic morality, how a few of our wonderfully trained and disciplined soldiers will sort out the whole Sierra Leone mess. Newspapers talk without a trace of irony of the white man's burden, and our commander in Freetown, Brigadier David Richards, sounds uncannily like a late 19th-century imperialist, such as Gordon or Rhodes.</p> <p>What is implicit in this modern morality tale is our own superiority, and the unquestioned benefits of European style progress and civilisation. What we wilfully chose to forget is our on-going complicity in the political instability and poverty of Africa. We mount such charades as Sierra Leone while we glut the continent with weapons - between 1995-97 the UK supplied small arms to over 100 countries.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the former head of the IMF, Michel Camdessus, pleaded with the west that the biggest thing it could do for Africa was to stop exporting arms to the continent. We agonise about Africa's inability to feed itself, while we benefit from the collapse of commodity prices which have destabilised dozens of African economies, and milk millions in interest on loans we made to prop up corrupt regimes.</p> <p>If Blair was really motivated by morality over Africa, he would have shown more interest in backing the campaign to meet the UN's educational targets by 2015, or would have done more to push Gordon Brown's debt relief efforts, which have still to produce tangible benefits for any African country apart from Uganda. But those are the sort of worthy things which don't have much resonance with the electorate, beyond some Guardian readers.</p> <p>Instead, Blair falls easily back into a tradition of showcasing British moral superiority - a tradition which appears the more naive and ill-thought-through for its parallels with another story of peace-making, this time in our own backyard. Why should conflict in Sierra Leone prove any simpler to resolve than in Northern Ireland?</p> <p>But such common-sense questions get swept aside by an enthusiastic moral narrative which won't admit that our budget and appetite for this African adventure will run out long before peace is secured. The suspicion has to be that this action is a substitute for the government having any other ideological vision. When domestic economic and political policy amount to an unglamorous pragmatism, what better way to tart it up than with a brave crusade or two?</p> <p>Just don't expect it to do much in the long term for the tragic people of Sierra Leone: we'll find a way to wriggle out, leaving our guns behind.</p> <p><br><a href=\"mailto:madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com\">Madeleine Bunting</a></p>",

It also sounds like the kind of moral purpose with which Palmerston infused his gunboat diplomacy. Pax Britannica was supposed to bring peace and prosperity to the world. In reality, it brought a hugely lucrative drugs trade to Asia and constructed a global economic system which supplied Britain with plentiful, cheap raw materials and large markets for our manufactured goods. It was an ideology thinly veneering our often brutal economic exploitation. VS Naipaul describes this beautifully at the beginning of his novel A Bend In The River, when he compares the European traders on the east coast of Africa with the Indians and Arabs: \"The Europeans could do one thing and say something quite different; and they could act in this way because they had an idea of what they owed to their civilisation. It was their great advantage over us. The Europeans wanted gold and slaves, like everybody else; but at the same time they wanted statues put up to themselves as people who had done good things for the slaves... they got both the slaves and the statues.\" Our colonial past isn't just history. The British still use a moral narrative to explain and justify our position and power in the world. We want to feel good about ourselves, and so, on to the conveniently distant canvas of Africa, we can project a wonderful tale about our altruistic morality, how a few of our wonderfully trained and disciplined soldiers will sort out the whole Sierra Leone mess. Newspapers talk without a trace of irony of the white man's burden, and our commander in Freetown, Brigadier David Richards, sounds uncannily like a late 19th-century imperialist, such as Gordon or Rhodes. What is implicit in this modern morality tale is our own superiority, and the unquestioned benefits of European style progress and civilisation. What we wilfully chose to forget is our on-going complicity in the political instability and poverty of Africa. We mount such charades as Sierra Leone while we glut the continent with weapons - between 1995-97 the UK supplied small arms to over 100 countries. Earlier this year, the former head of the IMF, Michel Camdessus, pleaded with the west that the biggest thing it could do for Africa was to stop exporting arms to the continent. We agonise about Africa's inability to feed itself, while we benefit from the collapse of commodity prices which have destabilised dozens of African economies, and milk millions in interest on loans we made to prop up corrupt regimes. If Blair was really motivated by morality over Africa, he would have shown more interest in backing the campaign to meet the UN's educational targets by 2015, or would have done more to push Gordon Brown's debt relief efforts, which have still to produce tangible benefits for any African country apart from Uganda. But those are the sort of worthy things which don't have much resonance with the electorate, beyond some Guardian readers. Instead, Blair falls easily back into a tradition of showcasing British moral superiority - a tradition which appears the more naive and ill-thought-through for its parallels with another story of peace-making, this time in our own backyard. Why should conflict in Sierra Leone prove any simpler to resolve than in Northern Ireland? But such common-sense questions get swept aside by an enthusiastic moral narrative which won't admit that our budget and appetite for this African adventure will run out long before peace is secured. The suspicion has to be that this action is a substitute for the government having any other ideological vision. When domestic economic and political policy amount to an unglamorous pragmatism, what better way to tart it up than with a brave crusade or two? Just don't expect it to do much in the long term for the tragic people of Sierra Leone: we'll find a way to wriggle out, leaving our guns behind. Madeleine Bunting",

It screwed down, ever more tightly, a doctrine of executive supremacy in which MPs at large are little more than also-rans, lobby fodder. Whatever \"modernisation\" means, it does not cover giving most MPs a larger share in deciding our collective destiny.</p> <p>In an obscure document which it did not even bother to put on the internet, preferring instead to lodge it in a parliamentary pigeonhole called the Vote Office, the government effectively told MPs to forget any attempt to increase their powers of scrutinising Whitehall, examining spending or calling ministers to account. Windows for reform close all too quickly. This will probably be MPs' only chance. In rejecting their bid for more powers, Tony Blair has ensured he will leave intact the unassailable might of parliamentary executive.</p> <p>Select committees are chaired by veterans and senior people - mainly Labour but including Tories and Liberal Democrats. In March these banded together to challenge the government (Select Committee on Liaison: Shifting the Balance: <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk.\" target=\"_NEW\">www.parliament.uk.</a>). They were not asking for much. They wanted bigger budgets, staff, more time for debates on their reports. Most of all they wanted recognition by ministers that making law and policy is a consensual business, in which MPs are partners not mere subordinates.</p> <p>Commons select committees were reformed just after Margaret Thatcher took power in 1979, and in the two decades since have become a fixture, most of them focusing on specific Whitehall departments. According to Giles Radice, Labour chair of the Treasury committee and leader of the March exercise, these specialist committees had provided bargain basement scrutiny.</p> <p>Some observers of parliament have been less complimentary, finding they have had little influence on policy.

      "bodyText": "The other day, with no press release, no public announcement and certainly no briefing by Number 10, the Blair government issued a major constitutional statement. That is to say it reiterated its distinctly unmodern version of how the House of Commons should work. It screwed down, ever more tightly, a doctrine of executive supremacy in which MPs at large are little more than also-rans, lobby fodder. Whatever \"modernisation\" means, it does not cover giving most MPs a larger share in deciding our collective destiny. In an obscure document which it did not even bother to put on the internet, preferring instead to lodge it in a parliamentary pigeonhole called the Vote Office, the government effectively told MPs to forget any attempt to increase their powers of scrutinising Whitehall, examining spending or calling ministers to account. Windows for reform close all too quickly. This will probably be MPs' only chance. In rejecting their bid for more powers, Tony Blair has ensured he will leave intact the unassailable might of parliamentary executive. Select committees are chaired by veterans and senior people - mainly Labour but including Tories and Liberal Democrats. In March these banded together to challenge the government (Select Committee on Liaison: Shifting the Balance: www.parliament.uk.). They were not asking for much. They wanted bigger budgets, staff, more time for debates on their reports. Most of all they wanted recognition by ministers that making law and policy is a consensual business, in which MPs are partners not mere subordinates. Commons select committees were reformed just after Margaret Thatcher took power in 1979, and in the two decades since have become a fixture, most of them focusing on specific Whitehall departments. According to Giles Radice, Labour chair of the Treasury committee and leader of the March exercise, these specialist committees had provided bargain basement scrutiny. Some observers of parliament have been less complimentary, finding they have had little influence on policy. Too often it has suited party whips (the Tories when they were in power, Labour vice versa) to put Commons amateurs on them and starve them of the resources they need to give their work intellectual credibility. Even the public accounts committee, despite its formal powers of investigation and the 800-odd National Audit Office staff it commands through the comptroller and auditor general, has too often seemed to be running to catch up. What the advent of a strong Labour government offered, said the March liaison committee report, was a chance to \"shift the balance between legislative and executive\". If MPs were more involved in scrutinising bills, defects might be spotted. But that would mean backbench MPs would have to start shaping up, employing proper staffs - and probably also working normal hours. Mr Radice and colleagues wanted to build an \"alternative career path\" with good MPs making a name for themselves not as ministers but as scrutineers. They did not consider the political implications of their suggestions - weaker party discipline pointing forward, perhaps, to the introduction of proportional representation for Westminster. The plan was to discipline ministers who came to committees and gave a \"a sub-standard response\". The implication was that, for the first time since the 17th century, legislators would face down the executive, maybe even by depriving ministers of office. Revolutionary talk, which the government has now rejected with contempt (The Government's Response, Cmnd 4737). Adopting the sort of tone you use with recalcitrant pets or unruly children, the government makes no concessions. This is par for the course on reform of the Commons, where chief whip Ann Taylor and ultramontane Margaret Beckett, leader of the house, have been veritable forces of conservatism. There is praise. The government says the select committees are \"an entrenched part of our constitutional arrangements as never before\". But as for any practical increment in their powers, forget it. The MPs' attempt to wrest control of their own committee membership away from the whips is rejected. The government will continue to choose who gets what assignment on the select committees, which basically means the executive will, once again, control the process by which it is assessed and monitored. Take the matter of staffing the committees, which pay their advisers paltry sums. Staffing is \"not a matter for the government\", it says; but only if you believe the cock-and-bull story that MPs are free to vote without reference to party whips and executive orders. We are cooperating more with select committees, says the government, citing multiple appearances by ministers.

Mr Boateng, whose clients include Mick Jagger and Mariella Frostrup, currently makes only bespoke women's clothes - which cost upwards of \u00a32,000. Observer Railtrack is set to win more than \u00a32bn a year extra in government funding for the next decade to expand the network and reverse the Beeching line closures of the Sixties. Track and stations that have been disused since as long ago as 1962 are likely to be revived to carry freight and commuter services. This move will create extra capacity and allow high-speed trains to run faster and on time.

My, how we've all aged. Was it the drugs, do you think? Judge Jules looked like Cyril Fletcher from That's Life, even down to the embossed leather armchair and 15-minute anecdotes without a punchline. Ken Tappenden, approaching retirement back in 1988 as divisional commander of Kent's police, recalled how his detective powers stirred again like a bear after a long winter: \"I noticed a large amount of traffic up and down the motorway,\" he recalled \"and it never started till one in the morning, which was a most unusual time to have traffic on the motorways.\" Clouseau was onto something.<br> Kent had seen nothing like it since rush hour five hours previously. It was bumper- to-bumper ravers in their mums' Triumph Dolomites, all thinking the M25 was a gorgon-headed psychedelic river, having taken just one of them E things. \"I felt ten-feet tall,\" someone said, rather unsurprisingly, \"and I could see multicoloured things flying around, and I could hear people talking a hundred yards away, as if they were in me ears.\" Amazing.<br> Arnold Ridley, who played Godfrey in Dad's Army, experienced similar feelings after just one cup of tea. Sitting in a deckchair, smoking an expensive cigar, Arnold looked less the sweet First Aid chappie than Mr Big Stuff. A darker side to his personality emerged through the smoke. He would order his wife to \"drive him to Thetford\" to buy \"booze\" (was it?). They might have said custard creams. My heart sank at the prospect of yet another film about British sitcom's greatest creation, but The Dad's Army Story found life in the old dog still. \"This is a fighting unit, not a girl guides outing,\" Mainwaring said to his platoon of wheezing old men. The truth, as Jimmy Perry revealed, was that most of them were as unfit as they looked. \"They thought their careers were over, and suddenly they had a new lease of life.\" The film ended movingly with a shot of a country village war memorial, Mainwaring's Churchillian bluster gaining gravitas as he built: \"Anyone who tries to take away our homes and our freedom, they'll find out what we can do. There are thousands like us all over England\". \"And Scotland,\" Fraser adds. <br> <strong> Roman Polanski: Scene By Scene </strong> (BBC2) was gripping stuff. Polanski and interviewer Mark Cousins were well-matched for their bout on the roof of the Mus\u00e9e D'Orsay, each trying to out-louche the other. Discussing the cut-glass beauty of Chinatown, Cousins asked him: \"What does Chinatown symbolise?\" Polanski sighed, took a long puff on a sumptuous cigar borrowed from Dad's Army's Godfrey. \"Christ, you keep asking me questions I'm embarrassed to answer. It's like asking a poet to explain a metaphor. I don't do this.\" The match was squaring up to a replay of Peter Bogdanovitch interviewing John Huston in the desert. When Bogdanovitch asked Huston about the lost innocence of America, symobolised by The Searchers, Huston looked stony-faced into the camera and shouted: \"Cut!\" We saw a clip of Sharon Tate dancing. \"Today's kind of girl,\" the cheesy news report said. After Tate's death, Polanski used his films to do his dreaming for him. Sex loomed large. There was Mia Farrow's rape in Rosemary's Baby, sex with a 13-year-old girl in The States, followed by the fictional rape of Tess in the dust of Normandy (standing in for Wessex). Was all this penetration, Cousins gulped, symbolic? Polanski dusted off his trousers. Was this what the PR meant by a plug for the new film? </p>",

      "body": "<p>Once - about a fortnight after the transmission of a Radio 4 programme - the producer and I received a memo from the BBC's complaints department. An elderly female listener had been appalled at the use of what we will for the moment call the copulatory gerund at just after 9am in the morning. Could we please explain why the word had been transmitted, and, furthermore, transmitted without an apology from the presenter? </p> <p>We listened to the tape twice, but didn't hear the word that was being complained about. Finally, tipped off by the correspondence unit that the foul-mouthed contributor was a woman, we concentrated on the female speakers. Eventually we found a reference - in an anecdote from a distinguished female journalist about attending the Henley Regatta - to something which had occurred while she was \"forking my smoked salmon\". Curiously, the listener had been less shocked by the mental image of a Fleet Street grande dame having sex with cured fish at Henley than by the use of a word she still considered taboo. </p> <p>But the story shows that some consumers of broadcasting are just sitting there wanting to be offended. Such people are going to have a huge bank holiday phone bill from ringing the duty office to complain about A Brief History Of The F-Word (tonight, 10.50pm, Channel 4). This is a brave programme to be showing at a time when the Mail On Sunday is running a campaign against swearing on television. </p> <p>Produced by David Jeffcock - whose interest in forbidden words may in part result from schoolyard teasing about his surname - the documentary manages, unlike other recent offerings on shocking subjects on Channel 4 and elsewhere, to educate as well as titillate. The lexicographer John Ayto reveals that, despite its most popular euphemism, the word has no Anglo-Saxon roots. And while some of the stories are familiar - the use by Peregrine Worsthorne, Kenneth Tynan and the Sex Pistols of the F-word on TV - there is also much fresher material, such as the account of how a pranking printer inserted the verb in a Times article in 1882. You get a genuine social history through the consideration of the gradual unstiffening of British lips. </p> <p>Nothing screws up a documentary of this kind more quickly than skimpy film research. But the archive used here is distinctive and illuminating. In black-and-white footage, decorously excited 60s readers queue to buy the newly legalised Lady Chatterley's Lover and discover what Mellors and Lady C called what they did to each other. \"One copy only,\" instructs a stern saleswoman as men grab one for each hand. \"I shall shortly be doing a course on the modern novel at university,\" insists one young man, to justify his purchase.

      "bodyText": "Once - about a fortnight after the transmission of a Radio 4 programme - the producer and I received a memo from the BBC's complaints department. An elderly female listener had been appalled at the use of what we will for the moment call the copulatory gerund at just after 9am in the morning. Could we please explain why the word had been transmitted, and, furthermore, transmitted without an apology from the presenter? We listened to the tape twice, but didn't hear the word that was being complained about. Finally, tipped off by the correspondence unit that the foul-mouthed contributor was a woman, we concentrated on the female speakers. Eventually we found a reference - in an anecdote from a distinguished female journalist about attending the Henley Regatta - to something which had occurred while she was \"forking my smoked salmon\". Curiously, the listener had been less shocked by the mental image of a Fleet Street grande dame having sex with cured fish at Henley than by the use of a word she still considered taboo. But the story shows that some consumers of broadcasting are just sitting there wanting to be offended. Such people are going to have a huge bank holiday phone bill from ringing the duty office to complain about A Brief History Of The F-Word (tonight, 10.50pm, Channel 4). This is a brave programme to be showing at a time when the Mail On Sunday is running a campaign against swearing on television. Produced by David Jeffcock - whose interest in forbidden words may in part result from schoolyard teasing about his surname - the documentary manages, unlike other recent offerings on shocking subjects on Channel 4 and elsewhere, to educate as well as titillate. The lexicographer John Ayto reveals that, despite its most popular euphemism, the word has no Anglo-Saxon roots. And while some of the stories are familiar - the use by Peregrine Worsthorne, Kenneth Tynan and the Sex Pistols of the F-word on TV - there is also much fresher material, such as the account of how a pranking printer inserted the verb in a Times article in 1882. You get a genuine social history through the consideration of the gradual unstiffening of British lips. Nothing screws up a documentary of this kind more quickly than skimpy film research. But the archive used here is distinctive and illuminating. In black-and-white footage, decorously excited 60s readers queue to buy the newly legalised Lady Chatterley's Lover and discover what Mellors and Lady C called what they did to each other. \"One copy only,\" instructs a stern saleswoman as men grab one for each hand. \"I shall shortly be doing a course on the modern novel at university,\" insists one young man, to justify his purchase. Later, there's a cleverly uncovered clip from a Wendy Craig domestic sitcom in which the dizzy mum has heard her son use \"the word\" which she never specifies. Even the sequence which has recently become obligatory in shocker documentaries - the one where young women sit around talking about their sex lives - is here relevant because they are discussing the fascinating and apposite question of in which circumstances lovers can use the word to each other. The word itself is spoken without apology or disguise at least a hundred times in clips or commentary. But, where many controversial documentaries become juvenile, this is a wholly grown-up show. And a brave one, because many in middle England will be put off their stroke if they're sitting there forking their salmon. Many BBC executives were surprised when Michael Jackson - who had been scheduling both BBC television channels - left the Corporation to become chief executive at the single-network Channel 4. But there are some kinds of programmes which are only possible beyond White City. A BBC2 controller who transmitted a detailed documentary about the copulatory oath would soon have the chair of the governors roaring F-words down the phone and the editor of the Daily Mail demanding their resignation.

      "body": "<p>Francisco Toledo has an almost pathological aversion to being photographed or interviewed, particularly by those with whom he is not familiar. It is an instinctive, perhaps a primitive fear, of being captured, defined, in someone else's notion of him. </p> <p>But that is just a fragment of the man. Those who know him best say he is a creature of unfathomable complexity. Physically and intellectually elusive, he is also immediate and accessible, surely the most accessible artist of his stature in the world. And as the retrospective of his work at London's Whitechapel Gallery shows, Toledo is one of the great artists of our times. If he is little known outside Latin America, it is only because he courts anonymity, not celebrity. </p> <p>Most mornings Toledo can be found on the quiet, shaded patio of the Instituto de Artes Graficas, a burnt-red adobe building across the square from Santo Domingo, the magnificent 16th-century Dominican church in the southern Mexican city of Oaxaca. Toledo's presence can be felt throughout the city, thanks to his patronage of a multitude of artistic and environmental organisations. He founded the centre in 1988 by donating the large colonial building in which it is housed, together with the core of its collection of more than 7,000 prints and 25,000 books. </p> <p>It is easy to miss Toledo. He is the darting figure in white cotton peasant clothes and dusty brown sandals. His hair is thick and distracted, and at the age of 60 his handsome face is as heavily etched as much of his art. His eyes are so fierce that they linger on you only sparingly, as if out of politeness; a moment longer and they would disturb the secrets of your soul. But then he smiles. </p> <p>Toledo always seems to appear out of nowhere, as if by magic. His presence is a mirage, fleeting, evanescent. Turn around and he is gone. Yet, at the same time, he inhabits the most tangible physical space of anyone I have ever met. Toledo, a friend says, is a man who fosters \"variable truths and contradictions\". You might tag him as shy and modest, but look at the photographs he has taken recently - his erect penis and testicles thrusting through the mottled skin of an iguana that he has draped over his naked body. </p> <p>Toledo's is the art of shamanism, in which people are transformed into beasts and animals may take on human characteristics. It is the art of the nagual , in which an animal is identified with a human, their fates intertwined. And it is the art of primal eroticism, in which an army of toads with human penises ejaculate in a joyous frenzy. \"Subjects emerge from one another,\" wrote Veronica Volkow, a Mexican poet who has known the artist for many years. \"A deer from a lion, an iguana from a woman, a cricket from the mouth of a toad. A chain joins all beings in the meshing of the gears of their devourings, their copulations, their mirrors, their metamophoses. The entire universe seems to be joined unto itself, emerging from and terminating in a circle that may begin from any mouth, any sex, any eye, any orifice, any touching.\" </p> <p>In Oaxaca people approach Toledo every day, with the deference reserved for the man universally known as \"El Maestro\". He is a towering presence in the civic life of the city, its most valued and significant citizen, a \"Promethean figure\", the New York Times called him, but his sense of civic responsibility is also a heavy burden, too heavy say some. </p> <p>Oaxaca (pronounced Wah-ha-ca) is the capital of the state of the same name, a city of some 300,000 people about 350 miles south-east of Mexico City. The state is one of the most beautiful but also most impoverished in the country, stretching from the cool, dense pine forests of the north to the thick, humid, mosquito-infested swamps along the Pacific coast. </p> <p>Oaxaca sits at just over 5,000ft, in a high valley dominated by the ancient site of Monte Alban, a huge, ruined temple complex and ceremonial city first settled by the Zapotecs around 600 BC. Of the state's more than 3m inhabitants, around a third, made up of at least 14 Indian peoples, speak no Spanish. </p> <p>Toledo is a Zapotec, born into a poor family in a small village just outside Juchitan on the hot Pacific coast. His grandfather was a cobbler, his grandmother's family were pig-slaughterers. When he was a child his father moved to a small town near the port and oil refining centre of Veracruz, where he became a successful shopkeeper. </p> <p>Toledo remembers a childhood roaming \"the rivers and mountains\", where he was first exposed to the teeming animal and insect life that later populated his art. He remembers armies of toads invading the house, thick clouds of bats, crabs, iguanas, grasshoppers, scorpions and crocodiles - creatures that had sacred meaning to the Indian peoples and are still the repository of potent myths. Toledo's aunt would tell him about such fabulous creatures as the four-eyed fish - two eyes to see the world above the water, two to see below - and the milkmaid snake, which could quiet babies' cries by stuffing its tail into their mouths. </p> <p>Toledo started drawing and painting early and was sent to Oaxaca to study when he was 12. There the library offered him his first exposure to modern painting, photography and the world beyond Mexico. He pored over the work of artists that would later inspire his own painting: Goya, Blake, Picasso, Hogarth, Klee and Tamayo, a fellow Zapotec and the pre-eminent figure in Mexican art. \"I didn't know it was possible to be a painter until I came here,\" Toledo says. </p> <p>When he was 17 he moved to Mexico City to study lithography, etching and engraving at the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes. He was soon noticed by a prominent dealer and had his first exhibitions at the age of 19, in Mexico City and Fort Worth, Texas. With the money he made, Toledo moved to Paris. It was a difficult but valuable time: he was poor, painfully shy and lonely, but also very productive. He worked almost continuously under the dark stairway of the university dormitory in which he lived. Tamayo and the Nobel prize-winning Mexican writer Octavio Paz, who were living in Paris, took him under their wings. \"It was wonderful,\" says Toledo. \"Tamayo invited me to his house and he started to sell my paintings. When the collectors would come to visit him, he'd say, 'Here is a young painter whose paintings are much cheaper than you can buy mine for'.\" </p> <p>He was taken up by two prominent dealers who got him shows all over Europe, then moved back to Mexico in 1965, desperate to reconnect with his roots. \"I wanted to have a family from Juchitan,\" he recalls. \"I wanted them to speak Zapoteco like my family.\" He moved back to Juchitan and married a Zapotec woman, with whom he had a child. </p> <p>But almost as soon as he returned, he began to miss Europe and the sophisticated life he had tasted there. Over the next two decades his restlessness became a kind of rootlessness, as he moved back and forwards between Paris and Mexico, between New York and Oaxaca. He divorced and in 1969 married a prominent Mexican poet and sociologist, with whom he had two children. </p> <p>He became mythologised as a kind of artistic vagabond, a man who had no home and no possessions other than what he needed to work with. He has always been astonishingly prolific, working on the ground, almost spontaneously, his fingers nimble, darting, fierce; he is as likely to work with tortoise shells or ostrich eggs as canvas or paper. </p> <p>In the past 10 years Toledo has done little painting, although he continues to work as a printmaker and has begun spending more time on his photographs. He has undertaken a couple of major commissions, one for the Mexican presidency, the proceeds of which, and all his other art, he has used for his artistic endeavours in Oaxaca. </p> <p>His personal needs are slight. He lives with his third wife, Trine Ellitsgaard, a Danish weaver with whom he has two young children, in almost extreme austerity and simplicity. </p> <p>The critic Andre Pieyre de Mandiargues summed up Toledo's extraordinary world in 1964. \"I know of no modern artist who is so pervaded, and so naturally, by a sacred sense of life, none who is bound to myth and magic with such seriousness and such simplicity; none who is so purely inspired by rite and fable.\"</p> <p>\u0095 At the Whitechapel Gallery, London E1 (020-7522 7888) till June 7.</p>",

In the past 10 years Toledo has done little painting, although he continues to work as a printmaker and has begun spending more time on his photographs. He has undertaken a couple of major commissions, one for the Mexican presidency, the proceeds of which, and all his other art, he has used for his artistic endeavours in Oaxaca. His personal needs are slight. He lives with his third wife, Trine Ellitsgaard, a Danish weaver with whom he has two young children, in almost extreme austerity and simplicity. The critic Andre Pieyre de Mandiargues summed up Toledo's extraordinary world in 1964. \"I know of no modern artist who is so pervaded, and so naturally, by a sacred sense of life, none who is bound to myth and magic with such seriousness and such simplicity; none who is so purely inspired by rite and fable.\" \u0095 At the Whitechapel Gallery, London E1 (020-7522 7888) till June 7.",

      "body": "<p>What an extraordinary place Dulwich Village is. Surrounded on all sides by some of the poorest, roughest, toughest London quarters, a world of intersecting railway arches, scrapyards, estates by the concrete-mixer load, bumper-to-bumper traffic and trains with scratch-tagged windows, it is a leafy, middle-class idyll, all ladies with discreetly loud voices talking about how well Johnny is doing at private school, men in Vyella shirts murdering lawns, gleaming estate cars and no, definitely no, McDonald's. If I lived here I would feel like Patrick McGoohan in The Prisoner, trapped in a pretty-pretty village from which there is no escape, even though the number 12 to Piccadilly Circus passes close by. </p> <p>The one oddly macabre note struck in this sylvan London village has, for the best part of 200 years, been Dulwich Picture Gallery and its slightly sinister mausoleum devoted to its founders, Noel Desenfans (1745-1807) and Francis Bourgeois (1756-1811). Mrs Desenfans lies here too. One of the four Neo-Classical sarcophagi in this Regency stage-set tomb was reserved for the gallery's architect, Sir John Soane (1757-1837). Perhaps even Sir John felt that the mausoleum he had created was disturbingly claustrophobic; he opted to be buried in old St Pancras churchyard, his bones rattled today in his crumbling tomb by the twin-turbo diesels that throb north from William Barlow's Victorian trainshed. </p> <p>The idea of combining a Graeco-Egyptian Regency mausoleum with an art gallery was a curious one in Soane's day. One could argue, though, that a picture gallery devoted largely to portraiture is a memento mori of sorts - all those long dead, long-faced English aristocrats peering at visitors through layers of varnished oils, Dutch burghers, foxy Italian models posing as saints, vulpine Hispanic grandees - and that this macabre building is actually rather sane. </p> <p>It certainly seems sane now that the Queen has been to open the revamp and extension of this, one of Britain's best loved art galleries. Closed for an \u00a38.3m rebuild - courtesy of the Heritage Lottery Fund and private donors - in January 1999, the Picture Gallery reopened this weekend. No one coming here will doubt that the money has been well spent. Soane's building has been lovingly reconstructed, intelligently rehung and walled on three sides by a brand new glass cloister designed by Rick Mather, master-planner of the South Bank Centre and an architect with a grace and lightness of touch that has made him a natural when it comes to extending old museums. Mather's cloister offers a gentle, beautifully lit walk around the borders of the gallery's old walled garden. Shafts of sunlight slice through the low white ceilings, lit subtly at night. </p> <p>The cloister faces a three-quarter quadrangle of rooms the Picture Gallery's director Giles Waterfield has long wanted. These include a bright and airy 60-seater cafe whose walls slide back on sunny days; a lecture-theatre that doubles up as a gallery, with a clever update of a classic Soane pendentive vault above the audience's and speaker's heads; a classroom; conservation workshop and new lavatories. From the leafy street, these rooms are concealed by a red brick, ever-so-English garden wall. Although the gallery wanted these new spaces, they had to be as discreet as possible so as not to detract from nor upstage Soane's much loved architectural sonnet. </p> <p>But, what the immaculate and sensitive new work has done is somehow to sanitise Britain's oldest public picture gallery. A part of its magic lay in it being hidden away in curious Dulwich and not visited in the kind of numbers expected of museums and galleries at the beginning of the 21st century. The idea of the offbeat, eccentric space that visitors chance upon happily or go to because they can have it virtually to themselves is frowned upon today by government, local authorities and even curators. Whether every museum or gallery benefits from the high numbers game or not, they are required to pack 'em in. </p> <p>Dulwich used to be quiet for a fair bit of the week - enjoyably so for those who came to escape the crowds of central London, who came to enjoy Soane's idiosyncratic buildings, its odd setting and its wonderful collection of grand old portraits. </p> <p>Some of the ghostly magic of the picture gallery has been exorcised. It was, until Giles Waterfield arrived in the 80s, woefully shabby. Walls that are now a pale Soanian terracotta were civil service gray. The floors were covered in squeaky cork tiles, space for hanging pictures was occupied by clanking lavs, the mausoleum was menacingly funereal. Electric lighting was harsh as only fluorescence can be, the display of books and postcards in the entrance hall meagre. I thought it then, along with the Soane Museum in Lincoln Inn's Fields, one of London's best kept secrets. </p> <p>It isn't shabby now. The floor is of brand new oak boards. Soane's skylights - wooden lanterns bringing daylight down to the paintings - have been renewed. New electric lighting washes the walls of the gallery in a semblance of sunlight. The old lavatories have been flushed away. The collection - Rembrandt, Van Dyck, Claude, Rubens, Cuyp, Poussin, Watteau, Gainsborough - has been elegantly rearranged with, in Waterfield's words, the \"beer drinkers\" (Brits, Dutch) on one side of the entrance hall-mausoleum axis, and \"wine drinkers\" (French, Italian, Spanish) on the other. The glass in the mausoleum has been cleaned so it is less spooky than it was before. </p> <p>These works have been carried out meticulously, but in shining an arc-light into the romantic gloom of the gallery, curator and architect have blasted away the ghost of Soane - and of Ruskin, who strolled here from Herne Hill to look at the pictures. Small wonder a pin-up Italian St John the Baptist looks so shocked, caught all but naked in his gilded frame. In a strange way, all this fresh paint and wood and light makes the gallery look a little too close in texture and spirit to Robert Venturi's Sainsbury Wing of the late 80s at the National Gallery. Venturi adopted the look and the form of his top-lit galleries from Dulwich. The two blur into one another in the mind's eye. </p> <p>It's a tricky job, revamping galleries. Dulwich Picture Gallery needed more care and attention than Waterfield and his finances could stretch to before the advent of the lottery. Many things have been added to make the gallery work as a better local art centre and visitor attraction. But something of its magic has gone. The selfish pleasure of idling through the gallery in the gloom, the same pleasure one took in the least visited of the churches of Venice with their secret Tintorettos, the pleasure one takes in country churches visited by vicars once a month, is fast dying. Perhaps it should. But perhaps the new look Dulwich Picture Gallery will age gracefully too.

Christopher Riley, 23, a midshipman first class, was accused of subjecting the 24-year-old woman to such a savage attack that her injuries were equivalent to childbirth. The woman claimed she was lured into a dark room at a party, thrown against a wall and brutally raped by Mr Riley on the last night of his week-long exchange visit. Mr Riley, claimed sex was consensual and her injuries came from heated and rough intercourse. They met in March last year while Mr Riley was staying at the Royal Britannia naval college in Dartmouth, Devon. Captain Gerald T Hatch - the US navy's most senior judge in Europe - delivered his verdict after considering the two versions of events for 90 minutes. The verdict came at the end of the five-day US naval court martial held at a Ministry of Defence base at Eastcote, west London. Some witnesses had flown from the US and Europe for the hearing.

      "body": "<p>In the lobby of the Dorchester Hotel, where I go to interview David Dimbleby, is a man in a suit - a member of the public - who greets Dimbleby like a long lost friend. \"Hey! Hello! You live in my street!\" he calls. Dimbleby, who is often mistaken for other walk-on parts in people's lives (he tells a good anecdote about being confused for a paint salesman on a train), sashays smoothly over to correct the mistake. He doesn't look completely delighted when it turns out the man really is his neighbour. \"Oh really, oh really,\" he says, continuing to smile and nod even when the man says: \"Your father, what a great broadcaster he was.\"</p> <p>Dimbleby is halfway back across the room when the man adds: \"I'll be watching you on Question Time on Sunday.\"</p> <p>There is a beat. Dimbleby doesn't turn round. \"Thursday,\" he says grimly, under his breath. \"The programme goes out on Thursday.\"</p> <p>It is a hard task to get Dimbleby to crack. He is the crackless man. Even his complexion is relatively line-free for a man of 61, as if the anxieties and troubles of his life have eased away into the ether before reaching his face. A face that doesn't do dishes. A face that registers neither ambition nor professional fear, nor familial competition, nor the fallout of divorce.</p> <p>Safe face. Safe hands. Just what you need to steer a big occasion through the dangerous waters of a live broadcast. Just the man you want on hand for this royal wedding or that election night, for this Queen Mother birthday parade, if not that. He kept his eye on the compass on millennium night, a working jib to Jamie Theakston's spinnaker. On Sunday he'll handle the BBC's Dunkirk 60th anniversary tribute. You know there'll be just the right amount of information and thoughtfulness and emotion, but with Dimbleby, the good old-fashioned Englishman, it is emotion recollected in tranquillity. And if he shows his heart on his sleeve, he'll have polished it just a tiny bit first.</p> <p>Sitting in the Dorchester, he is full of Dunkirk. He says, in his nicely posh Charterhouse/Oxford voice: \"I think all the hyperbole about it was justified. I think Dunkirk was a miracle. It was a real pivotal turning point.\" He talks in detail about what it meant then, and with hindsight. He reflects about Churchill's standing before and after, about the views of Halifax. He says \"as you know\" a couple of times, and \"you will have read\", taking responsibility for your ignorance, and once he says with feeling: \"Thank God we're an island.\"</p> <p>But he's at his best conjuring it up, describing tumult in the calmest of ways: to find civilians getting into a boat and going off to help and coming under appalling attack, gunfire and being bombed and seeing bodies in the water and ships sinking all around them, and the sky completely black. It must have been terrifying.</p> <p>\"I was so moved by reading about it,\" he says. \"I came out into my garden in Sussex, which is right by the sea at Eastbourne, on a brilliant summer day, I thought, this is something that is very rare, a moment when a country has been saved by the people's courage, this way of being stalwart in disaster. I was biting my lip to control my emotions.\"</p> <p>It is very hard to work out what Dimbleby is really thinking, or feeling. He appears at first to be controlled about many things. He used to be a \"chronic fiddler\" (his father advised him when on camera to keep away from swivel chairs), but you would never know it to look at him. Only his knees move in time with his words. He claims to suffer from pre-broadcast nerves but you would never know that either.</p> <p>And he abides by certain conversational rules. He never talks about his younger brother, the broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby: \"It would be undignified.\" He has always neatly summed up the influence of his father, Richard, \"the voice of a nation\", by saying he helped him \"get in\" to the BBC, but he has \"got on\" by himself. He is \"Trappist\" on the subject of his wife of 25 years, the cookery writer Josceline Dimbleby, whom he left in 1992 for his much younger assistant, Belinda Giles. He is almost monosyllabic about the local newspaper business he inherited from his father and about which he is said to care deeply. \"It ticks over,\" he says, clipped. He won't even talk about his other brother Nicholas, a sculptor. Why not: he's not in competition with him? \"Because it's rude.\"</p> <p>The real Dimbleby has to be found in snatches, in juxtaposition. His ambition, for example, is a baffler. Several times he refers to the \"nobility\" of the BBC and of his own heritage - \"journalists for five generations\". But he talks about himself as someone who sort of wandered into the street and found himself on camera. \"I've never been ambitious. I've rather had ambition thrust upon me.\" He simply likes what he does, he says. \"It's fun and it's relatively well paid and varied which is nice and you don't have the burden of big decisions. You carry the privilege of quizzing people about their big decisions which is rather different.\"</p> <p>Lasting 40 years, his is a career that has trodden a careful political path. He has caused only two major furores: once for implying a visit by Richard Nixon was a con; once for quizzing Harold Wilson on how much he got for his memoirs. He outmanoeuvred Jeremy Paxman and Sue Lawley to the Question Time chair. And, in a culture increasingly attacted to youth, he has seen off John Birt, against whom he spoke out, and grins and bears it under Greg Dyke: \"It's too early to say.\"</p> <p>He would have liked to have been director-general. \"Yes I would. I think I would have been all right. There was a tradition of broadcasters being director-general and I was a broadcaster and I didn't like the tradition of people who had been administrators. They chose an accountant and I can't remember what Dyke did but I think in my bit, news and current affairs, which is perilous territory politically, you need to feel you're being led by someone who really understands the nature of it. And that's what I thought I might like to do. But there was a moment and it passed.\"</p> <p>He becomes increasingly expansive after this, as if taking refuge in his home life. The Trappist father would not have approved, but he let slip quite a lot about life chez Dimbleby, lives one and two. He and Josceline lived in Putney's \"media gulch\", he sighs. They had to hide from Jilly Cooper in the end because she wrote about them so much in her Common Years newspaper column. In life mark two, he divides his time between a redbrick semi in north London and a house on the Downs. He and Giles aren't married. \"Keeps them on their toes\", he murmurs.</p> <p>In the summer, they're moving to the country full-time. \"It's very raffish, very laid back. People don't complain down there.\" He talks at length about the school arrangements for his two stepchildren - \"common-law step I should say\" - which is rather touching. Nine-year-old Joe does a mean impression of Chris Tarrant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? \"He's a very good mimic,\" says Dimbleby, though he admits to not having seen the show. (He never watches television and only listens to news on radio. Not even The Archers? \"Not even The Archers.\")</p> <p>He has three grown-up children about whom he is \"quite soppy. I dote on them all.\" He also has a two-year-old, Fred. Dimbleby can't understand the furore over the Blair baby. \"It seems to me an entirely private matter. I can't see it as a vote winner. The idea that you parade a one-year-old and everyone votes for you. Blair's sleepless nights.\" He adds, unnecessarily: \"Fred was a genius. He slept from almost the beginning.\"</p> <p>Who is going to inherit his newspapers? \"That is one of the problems. I don't know. I don't know. If you leave a bit to everybody it collapses. If you leave it all to one the others all feel pissed off. It's impossible to tell. One child's a jazz musician, one is a painter, one is a management consultant and one is two. I think my hopes are on the two-year-old.\"</p> <p>He laughs. Then he says: \"I do have a hope - or is it a fear? - that at the moment, just at this moment, things seem so exciting and enjoyable and right in my life, both on the work front and privately, I'm really loving every day... that my hope is that that won't suddenly be disrupted or destroyed. Nothing we can do about it. Fate is fate. You know what life's like, don't know what will happen next.\"</p> <p>His father died at 52. Does this anxiety come from being nine years older than that? \"It is odd. I think of it as extra time. I keep asking myself whether I've done the right things in my life, whether the things I've done have been right, this is time he didn't have. Shouldn't you be doing more? Achieving more. You can't just chunter on like this . . .\"</p> <p>He breaks off. \"After all it's only telly,\" I say. Seamlessly, he says: \"I agree. It's nothing. It's nothing. It's only telly.\"</p> <p>Somehow I don't think he means it.</p>",

I've rather had ambition thrust upon me.\" He simply likes what he does, he says. \"It's fun and it's relatively well paid and varied which is nice and you don't have the burden of big decisions. You carry the privilege of quizzing people about their big decisions which is rather different.\" Lasting 40 years, his is a career that has trodden a careful political path. He has caused only two major furores: once for implying a visit by Richard Nixon was a con; once for quizzing Harold Wilson on how much he got for his memoirs. He outmanoeuvred Jeremy Paxman and Sue Lawley to the Question Time chair. And, in a culture increasingly attacted to youth, he has seen off John Birt, against whom he spoke out, and grins and bears it under Greg Dyke: \"It's too early to say.\" He would have liked to have been director-general. \"Yes I would. I think I would have been all right. There was a tradition of broadcasters being director-general and I was a broadcaster and I didn't like the tradition of people who had been administrators. They chose an accountant and I can't remember what Dyke did but I think in my bit, news and current affairs, which is perilous territory politically, you need to feel you're being led by someone who really understands the nature of it. And that's what I thought I might like to do. But there was a moment and it passed.\" He becomes increasingly expansive after this, as if taking refuge in his home life. The Trappist father would not have approved, but he let slip quite a lot about life chez Dimbleby, lives one and two. He and Josceline lived in Putney's \"media gulch\", he sighs. They had to hide from Jilly Cooper in the end because she wrote about them so much in her Common Years newspaper column. In life mark two, he divides his time between a redbrick semi in north London and a house on the Downs. He and Giles aren't married. \"Keeps them on their toes\", he murmurs. In the summer, they're moving to the country full-time. \"It's very raffish, very laid back. People don't complain down there.\" He talks at length about the school arrangements for his two stepchildren - \"common-law step I should say\" - which is rather touching. Nine-year-old Joe does a mean impression of Chris Tarrant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? \"He's a very good mimic,\" says Dimbleby, though he admits to not having seen the show. (He never watches television and only listens to news on radio. Not even The Archers? \"Not even The Archers.\") He has three grown-up children about whom he is \"quite soppy. I dote on them all.\" He also has a two-year-old, Fred. Dimbleby can't understand the furore over the Blair baby. \"It seems to me an entirely private matter. I can't see it as a vote winner. The idea that you parade a one-year-old and everyone votes for you. Blair's sleepless nights.\" He adds, unnecessarily: \"Fred was a genius. He slept from almost the beginning.\" Who is going to inherit his newspapers? \"That is one of the problems. I don't know. I don't know. If you leave a bit to everybody it collapses. If you leave it all to one the others all feel pissed off. It's impossible to tell. One child's a jazz musician, one is a painter, one is a management consultant and one is two. I think my hopes are on the two-year-old.\" He laughs. Then he says: \"I do have a hope - or is it a fear? - that at the moment, just at this moment, things seem so exciting and enjoyable and right in my life, both on the work front and privately, I'm really loving every day... that my hope is that that won't suddenly be disrupted or destroyed. Nothing we can do about it. Fate is fate. You know what life's like, don't know what will happen next.\" His father died at 52. Does this anxiety come from being nine years older than that? \"It is odd. I think of it as extra time. I keep asking myself whether I've done the right things in my life, whether the things I've done have been right, this is time he didn't have. Shouldn't you be doing more? Achieving more. You can't just chunter on like this . . .\" He breaks off. \"After all it's only telly,\" I say. Seamlessly, he says: \"I agree. It's nothing. It's nothing. It's only telly.\" Somehow I don't think he means it.",

Lederer's Hollywood debut in Man of Two Worlds (1934), was, strangely for someone bought by RKO as a romantic European lead, as an Eskimo introduced into the complexities of western civilisation, a role he played with an ingratiating blend of naivete and bemusement. In many of his following films, he showed a deftness for light comedy, playing an illegal immigrant helping chorus-girl Ginger Rogers in Romance In Manhattan (1935); a prince posing as a bellboy in William Wyler's The Gay Deception, (also 1935), and an actor who causes a scandal by accidentally kissing Ida Lupino in the cinema while under the spell of the picture in One Rainy Afternoon (1936).

After playing a gigolo on whom Claudette Colbert uses her charms to distract him from John Barrymore's wife in Midnight (1939), Lederer demonstrated more range and depth than he had been able to hitherto in three anti-Nazi movies. I n Confessions Of A Nazi Spy (1939), as a downtrodden German-American who steals secrets and becomes a Nazi agent to support his family, he managed to imbue this unsympathetic weasel with humanity.

The chairman of the main lobby group, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner, Geoff Clark, said the huge turnout gave a mandate for some form of official agreement between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians \"There's a clear message that people from all walks of life have all walked together here for a single purpose and that's to unite the country in what I believe is an agreement and a treaty,\" he said. In a carnival atmosphere the bridge was closed to traffic and an aeroplane wrote the word \"sorry\" high above the procession. The weekend marked the anniversary of the 1967 referendum in which Australians voted overwhelmingly to include aborigines and Torres Strait islanders as citizens.

The substantial lead enjoyed by the PRI's Francisco Labastida at the start of the campaign has faded away, with the most recent opinion polls showing him running neck and neck with Vicente Fox of the National Action Party at about 40%. The veteran leftwinger Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, has most of the remaining votes. \"It looks like it is going to be a dead heat until the last minute,\" said a political analyst, Alejandro Proire, after a televised debate between the three main presidential candidates last Friday set the scene for the final push for votes before the election on July 2. No one doubts that the PRI's party machine remains powerful, but most observers agree that it can no longer guarantee victory to its candidate, or - amid the unprecedented level of electoral monitoring - orchestrate the fraudulent practices of the past, should disaster strike. So it was a relatively vulnerable Mr Labastida, made even more so by his grey bureaucratic image and 36 years of service in the PRI, who faced the two main opposition candidates in the debate. They attacked his party's reputation for endemic corruption, economic mismanagement and decades of broken promises in a country where 40m people live in poverty. \"His situation is very very difficult.

The question is whether it stops people abandoning him,\" said Carlos Elizondo, who heads the Cide thinktank in Mexico City. Mr Fox, meanwhile, is under pressure to repair the damage he did to himself earlier last week by a series of petulant outbursts that blocked talks on the terms of the debate and opened him up to ridicule as a spoilt child and a potentially authoritarian leader. The blunder, played out on live television, appeared to threaten Mr Fox's painstaking efforts to built a broad-based movement appealing to all those who want \"change\", stretching far beyond his own conservative party and its reputation for elitism and Catholic intolerance. In the debate, Mr Fox \"managed to neutralise the curse of his mistakes earlier this week,\" said Mr Elizondo. However, the post-debate consensus is that this former rancher and one-time Coca-Cola executive is unlikely to attract many more supporters to a political project that has built up steam largely through his idiosyncratic mixture of cowboy-style audacity and sharp marketing.
