The project is the brainchild of pianist Roger Vignoles, who, between now and next April, is presenting a series of concerts that examine Faur\u00e9's works in the double context of his times and the tradition of the European art song. We kicked off with Thomas Allen and a programme placing La Bonne Chanson (arguably Faur\u00e9's greatest cycle) alongside his early settings of Th\u00e9ophile Gautier and works by Ravel and Reynaldo Hahn. </p> <p>The Gautier settings may be apprenticeship works, but they are far from slight. Many characteristics of the mature composer are already present: a soundworld in which every gesture, however small, speaks volumes; the flickering sensitivity to every nuance of emotion. La Chanson du P\u00eacheur is ostensibly a strophic song expressing supreme grief at the death of the beloved; yet each strophe builds towards an explosion of anguished melody by means of choked, fragmented recitative. By the time Faur\u00e9 got to La Bonne Chanson in 1894, his harmonic and structural palette had substantially increased, largely thanks to Wagner's influence. Chromatic ambivalence and interwoven leitmotifs link the songs, enshrouding Verlaine's poems with a heady sensuality. </p> <p>Allen is an immaculate interpreter of French music, his voice lived-in, tender yet veiled, the nuances of the texts captured with sparse yet telling subtlety. There's a slightly furtive quality to La Bonne Chanson - and you feel you're in the presence of a man who is quietly confiding secrets. </p> <p>When he turns to Hahn, Allen uses a broader expressive range. Hahn is better known as Proust's lover than as a composer, though, like his companion, he was effectively in search of lost time, forever bringing the past to bear upon the present. Eighteenth-century lyrics start as pastiche Bach, then turn fin-de-si\u00e8cle sexy. His settings of medieval poetry capture the tangy syncopations of troubadour songs. Victor Hugo comes in for dark-hued super-Romantic treatment. </p> <p>Ravel was represented by the quirky Histoires Naturelles. A group of anthropomorphic birds and insects are depicted with a wry humour and more than an occasional hint of sadness. The vocal writing is inherently declamatory. Allen delivers it all with a fine combination of sardonicism and beauty. Vignoles, throughout, is a lustrous accompanist, translucent of texture, incandescent in tone.

      "body": "<p>'You couldn't stay on an extra hour tonight, could you?\" may once have been a genuine one-off plea. But for today's support staff, it is an increasingly common mantra. Before you know it, leaving at your contracted time of 5pm is little more than wishful thinking. </p> <p>\"The average UK employee works seven hours a week for nothing,\" claims a new survey by the TUC, which adds that we now work the longest hours in Europe. \"Four million staff regularly contribute more than five hours a week unpaid, and half regularly work on their days off.\" Little wonder the report found that workers are cheated out of \u00a323bn in unpaid overtime every year. Another recent survey, published by Abbey National, has discovered that, irrespective of whether overtime is rewarded in paypackets, almost one in four UK employees puts in extra time and half regularly take work home. </p> <p>So when's the revolution, or at the very least, the odd protest? Surprisingly, you'll rarely find employees objecting, according to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). Its study, Living At Work, reveals that one in eight people who work long hours say they do so because they genuinely enjoy their jobs. </p> <p>Indeed, work has rarely been so fashionable. Dramas such as Ally McBeal are glittering advertisements for office life, featuring characters who hardly ever seem to go home. Personnel Today magazine agrees that some people thrive on working long hours - at least for part of their lives: \"Soho twentysomething media whizz-kids, for instance, favour a seamless blend of work and life.\" </p> <p>Others do it for the extra money or to enhance career prospects, claims the Institute for Employment Studies (IES). Nevertheless, the IES found that more often, negative work pressures are to blame for the \"let's work late\" culture. Greater competition, fewer staff and tighter budgets are contributing factors, along with increasingly demanding clients - which has come about largely as a result of today's 24-hour society. </p> <p>\"There are 1m people at work at any time between 9pm and 1am in the UK, and this figure is likely to double in the next 10 years,\" predicts sociologist Michael Willmott of the Future Foundation. \"That's down to the internet, with activities such as divorce-filing and house-buying now possible at any time of the day or night. In addition, open-all-hours supermarkets, all-night bars and late-night gyms - and the increasingly global economy - are accountable.\" </p> <p>Heavy and unwelcome workloads are cited by the IES as the chief reason for the millennial rise in overtime. For PAs, the story is particularly bleak. If your manager works into the night, the chances are that you will too. And, according to research by the CIPD, managers overwhelmingly constitute the group working the longest hours of all. \"Other kinds of secretaries also suffer,\" says a spokesperson. \"The more work the boss takes on, the more administration there is. Overtime has an incredibly fast spiralling effect and support roles are the worst hit. If they don't complain, it tends not to be because they enjoy having no life. Rather, it's usually due to fear.\" </p> <p>This fear, not surprisingly, is exacerbated in organisations where long hours are interpreted as demonstrating commitment. Angela Howard, a researcher in working hours, claims this increasingly common myth is a legacy of the mid-90s, \"when there was a culture of job insecurity that drove many people to work harder and longer. These levels became the norm and that's why overtime - especially unpaid - doesn't get the objection it should.\" </p> <p>Whether you're in a slave-driven organisation or you actually want to work all the hours God sends, the impact is serious. Consider a survey of Toyota in Japan where 124,000 of the 200,000 employees were found to be suffering from chronic fatigue - which was affecting their precision - due to excessive working hours. </p> <p>What's more, the Industrial Society recently found that workaholism has become the biggest threat to marriages and long-term relationships. So stressed-out have some late-night workers become that they are suing employers. Lucy Daniels, associate of the Work Life Research Centre, claims this threat partly accounts for the efforts of some major employers finally to start attacking presenteeism. \"To be fair, the main reason is that they're realising the severity of repercussions. But some are also, quite simply, scared of lawsuits.\" </p> <p>For companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers - which now examines employees' timesheets to identify people who spend too long at work - the implementation of the Working Time Directive and the government's recent emphasis on work-life balance have been significant. And, says Ian Brown, HR manager at GlaxoWellcome, where managers are now expected to tell staff who continually stay late to go home, generation X-ers should also be thanked for changes. \"These people - the young high-flyers who can afford to have greater demands of employers in today's tighter employment market - are actually turning down job offers in companies that lack progressive working-hours policies.\" </p> <p>A company at the forefront of decreasing overtime is BT. A complete overhaul of working practices has been outlined in its recent document that reveals staff will be warned that working too many hours has a \"damaging effect\" on them, their families, and their communities. Joanna Foster, chair of the National Work-Life Forum, is optimistic that \"the next few years will see a surge in organisations adopting similarly specific polices on lower working hours.\" </p> <p>But there is such a thing as taking the drive too far. British companies would be advised to ignore the example of American oil tycoon, Armand Hammer, who became notorious for firing employees for incompetence if they were found in the office after hours. </p> <p><strong>Clockwatching</strong><br>We asked two PAs to calculate how many hours they work</p> <p><strong> Sally Gordon, 30, works as PA to the MD of Pink Elephant UK, a Reading-based IT service management company. She is a strict 9-5er.</strong> </p> <p>\"Unless there's a really good reason, I refuse to work longer than my contracted hours. In my last job, I had hardly any life and I didn't want a repeat of that. I asked careful questions at interview as well as asking around in the office. When I realised that most people do go home on time - and that a bit of assertiveness goes a long way if ever there is an issue about it - I decided that I would take the job. </p> <p>\"I think it helps that there's a bar on the premises. It gives me and my colleagues an extra incentive to say, 'Right, we're off'. In fact, on a Friday afternoon, everyone clears the office simultaneously to go for drinks. Some days, the boss comes round and says, 'OK guys, finish off. We're all going home now.' </p> <p>\"I resented my previous employer hugely because of the expectation to work unpaid overtime. I wound up hating my job. Here, on the other hand, I feel that I work for a company that respects my right to a life, and that, in turn, makes me respect them.\" </p> <p> <strong>Rachel Smith (not her real name), 25, works as a PA for an advertising company in the West End. She begins her day no later than 7.30am and rarely leaves the office before 7pm.</strong> </p> <p>\"Most days, I could reasonably finish all my work within an eight-hour day. But I get resentful looks from colleagues if I look ready to leave at 5pm. If ever I do that - which is very seldom - I loudly announce that I'm taking work home and pack files and paperwork. It's assumed that I'll give up my evening to work, whereas I won't even open my case. </p> <p>\"Sometimes I do enjoy staying late. Since I'm single and not on a huge wage, I can't afford to go out every night. So it's a case of sitting in front of the TV with an M&amp;S dinner, or having a laugh with people in the office. </p> <p>\"But most of the time, the reason for staying on is because of peer pressure and the clear message that the organisation gives out about long hours being the best way to prove you take pride in your work. </p> <p>\"Some weekends, I sleep until at least lunchtime because I'm so tired from my working week. That is making me think about moving on. But I'm worried it will be just the same in other offices.\"</p>",

Another recent survey, published by Abbey National, has discovered that, irrespective of whether overtime is rewarded in paypackets, almost one in four UK employees puts in extra time and half regularly take work home. So when's the revolution, or at the very least, the odd protest? Surprisingly, you'll rarely find employees objecting, according to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). Its study, Living At Work, reveals that one in eight people who work long hours say they do so because they genuinely enjoy their jobs. Indeed, work has rarely been so fashionable. Dramas such as Ally McBeal are glittering advertisements for office life, featuring characters who hardly ever seem to go home. Personnel Today magazine agrees that some people thrive on working long hours - at least for part of their lives: \"Soho twentysomething media whizz-kids, for instance, favour a seamless blend of work and life.\" Others do it for the extra money or to enhance career prospects, claims the Institute for Employment Studies (IES). Nevertheless, the IES found that more often, negative work pressures are to blame for the \"let's work late\" culture. Greater competition, fewer staff and tighter budgets are contributing factors, along with increasingly demanding clients - which has come about largely as a result of today's 24-hour society. \"There are 1m people at work at any time between 9pm and 1am in the UK, and this figure is likely to double in the next 10 years,\" predicts sociologist Michael Willmott of the Future Foundation. \"That's down to the internet, with activities such as divorce-filing and house-buying now possible at any time of the day or night. In addition, open-all-hours supermarkets, all-night bars and late-night gyms - and the increasingly global economy - are accountable.\" Heavy and unwelcome workloads are cited by the IES as the chief reason for the millennial rise in overtime. For PAs, the story is particularly bleak. If your manager works into the night, the chances are that you will too. And, according to research by the CIPD, managers overwhelmingly constitute the group working the longest hours of all. \"Other kinds of secretaries also suffer,\" says a spokesperson. \"The more work the boss takes on, the more administration there is. Overtime has an incredibly fast spiralling effect and support roles are the worst hit. If they don't complain, it tends not to be because they enjoy having no life. Rather, it's usually due to fear.\" This fear, not surprisingly, is exacerbated in organisations where long hours are interpreted as demonstrating commitment. Angela Howard, a researcher in working hours, claims this increasingly common myth is a legacy of the mid-90s, \"when there was a culture of job insecurity that drove many people to work harder and longer. These levels became the norm and that's why overtime - especially unpaid - doesn't get the objection it should.\" Whether you're in a slave-driven organisation or you actually want to work all the hours God sends, the impact is serious. Consider a survey of Toyota in Japan where 124,000 of the 200,000 employees were found to be suffering from chronic fatigue - which was affecting their precision - due to excessive working hours. What's more, the Industrial Society recently found that workaholism has become the biggest threat to marriages and long-term relationships. So stressed-out have some late-night workers become that they are suing employers. Lucy Daniels, associate of the Work Life Research Centre, claims this threat partly accounts for the efforts of some major employers finally to start attacking presenteeism. \"To be fair, the main reason is that they're realising the severity of repercussions. But some are also, quite simply, scared of lawsuits.\" For companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers - which now examines employees' timesheets to identify people who spend too long at work - the implementation of the Working Time Directive and the government's recent emphasis on work-life balance have been significant. And, says Ian Brown, HR manager at GlaxoWellcome, where managers are now expected to tell staff who continually stay late to go home, generation X-ers should also be thanked for changes. \"These people - the young high-flyers who can afford to have greater demands of employers in today's tighter employment market - are actually turning down job offers in companies that lack progressive working-hours policies.\" A company at the forefront of decreasing overtime is BT. A complete overhaul of working practices has been outlined in its recent document that reveals staff will be warned that working too many hours has a \"damaging effect\" on them, their families, and their communities. Joanna Foster, chair of the National Work-Life Forum, is optimistic that \"the next few years will see a surge in organisations adopting similarly specific polices on lower working hours.\" But there is such a thing as taking the drive too far. British companies would be advised to ignore the example of American oil tycoon, Armand Hammer, who became notorious for firing employees for incompetence if they were found in the office after hours. Clockwatching We asked two PAs to calculate how many hours they work Sally Gordon, 30, works as PA to the MD of Pink Elephant UK, a Reading-based IT service management company. She is a strict 9-5er. \"Unless there's a really good reason, I refuse to work longer than my contracted hours. In my last job, I had hardly any life and I didn't want a repeat of that. I asked careful questions at interview as well as asking around in the office. When I realised that most people do go home on time - and that a bit of assertiveness goes a long way if ever there is an issue about it - I decided that I would take the job. \"I think it helps that there's a bar on the premises. It gives me and my colleagues an extra incentive to say, 'Right, we're off'. In fact, on a Friday afternoon, everyone clears the office simultaneously to go for drinks. Some days, the boss comes round and says, 'OK guys, finish off. We're all going home now.' \"I resented my previous employer hugely because of the expectation to work unpaid overtime. I wound up hating my job. Here, on the other hand, I feel that I work for a company that respects my right to a life, and that, in turn, makes me respect them.\" Rachel Smith (not her real name), 25, works as a PA for an advertising company in the West End. She begins her day no later than 7.30am and rarely leaves the office before 7pm. \"Most days, I could reasonably finish all my work within an eight-hour day. But I get resentful looks from colleagues if I look ready to leave at 5pm. If ever I do that - which is very seldom - I loudly announce that I'm taking work home and pack files and paperwork. It's assumed that I'll give up my evening to work, whereas I won't even open my case. \"Sometimes I do enjoy staying late. Since I'm single and not on a huge wage, I can't afford to go out every night. So it's a case of sitting in front of the TV with an M&amp;S dinner, or having a laugh with people in the office. \"But most of the time, the reason for staying on is because of peer pressure and the clear message that the organisation gives out about long hours being the best way to prove you take pride in your work. \"Some weekends, I sleep until at least lunchtime because I'm so tired from my working week. That is making me think about moving on. But I'm worried it will be just the same in other offices.\"",

      "bodyText": "Richard Branson and Cherie Booth were destined to be successful from the age of ten. Childhood self-esteem can overwhelm academic disadvantage or social deprivation in determining future earnings power, according to major new research. The research will cast serious doubt over the recent narrow focus of education experts on academic achievement in primary schools. 'There is now clear evidence that children with higher self-esteem at age 10 get as much of a kick to their adult earning power as those with equivalent higher maths or reading ability,' said Leon Feinstein of the influential Centre for Economic Performance. Parents' interest in the education of their child and whether they exhibit hostility to the child are also 'hugely important'. A father's hostility had as much influence as the father's own academic performance. Feinstein and his colleagues tracked children for 30 years using the British Cohort Study, which interviewed the parents of all babies born in the UK in the first week of April 1970. The children were subsequently questioned at 5, 10, 16, 26 and as they reached their 30th birthdays earlier this year. Self-esteem was monitored at 10 by asking the children a series of questions, such as 'Do you think other children often say nasty things about you?' and 'Are there lots of things about yourself that you would like to change?' Boys in particular who were anti-social and had low self-esteem at 10 are at greater risk of unemployment in early adulthood. Young boys with higher self-esteem are less likely to be unemployed in later life, and for shorter periods. Bright children often have higher self-esteem, as do some from more affluent backgrounds. But the study compared children from similar backgrounds and still found that those who were psychologically well-balanced at 10 were now doing much better than their peers. 'For example, in the case of two children from families with low income and with parents who left school at the minimum leaving age,' said Feinstein, 'the child with higher self-esteem at age ten will earn more, even if the children have the same scores in maths and reading.'

The Virgin entrepreneur Richard Branson, the son of a judge, came from an affluent and supportive upper middle- class family. However, he always underperformed academically. He went on to become one of the 20 richest men in Britain. Cherie Booth grew up in a relatively poor family with little academic background but significant emotional support from her mother Gale. She is now one of Britain's most dist-inguished barristers, reportedly earning \u00a3250,000 a year. A string of other highly successful people underperformed at school but, boosted by self-confidence from an early age, have become successful in their chosen careers. Alan Sugar, Lynne Franks and Max Clifford all had limited conventional academic success but supportive families and developed social skills at an early age. 'There may now be grounds for arguing that school performance should be assessed not only in terms of maths, reading or science scores but also in terms of the success or failure of helping children to develop in other ways,' said Feinstein. 'Schools are geared to helping pupils achieve good key stage and exam scores.

The film of Joanne Harris's best-selling novel, Chocolat, is tipped to be an autumn hit that will earn director Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m his second Oscar nomination.</p> <p>Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina and Hallstr\u00f6m's wife, Lena Olin, star in the film of the book which has turned into a literary phenomenon, transforming the life of the French teacher from Barnsley who wrote it.</p> <p>Harris, 36, penned the novel after she lost patience with her husband, Kevin, spending nights in front of the television watching football. 'It's what men like doing,' he said. 'Women like eating chocolate.' Less than two years later, Harris has become the North of England's most unlikely purveyor of sex, chocolate and big screen success.</p> <p>Chocolat has sold in 23 countries worldwide and made the Whitbread Novel of the Year shortlist. It is still in the paperback bestsellers' list - more than a year after it was published - and it is set to stay there for another year when the movie version is released. Only J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels have enjoyed greater success.</p> <p>Chocolat tells the story of a beautiful stranger, Vianne Rocher, played by Binoche, who walks into the fictional village of Lansquenet, between Bordeaux and Toulouse, and opens a chocolate shop in Lent, despite the opposition of the village priest who believes in self-denial.</p> <p>It is not long before the shop's chocolate 'Nipples of Venus' begin to transform the village. People fall in love, dance and carouse. Vianne, herself, falls for a gypsy called Roux, played by Depp. It is all too much for the pious mayor, played by Molina, who tells Binoche, 'You and your idiot chocolate, get out!'</p> <p>The theme of the book is transformation and joy.

      "bodyText": "First it was sex. Then it was movies. Then chocolate. Now it is all three together. The film of Joanne Harris's best-selling novel, Chocolat, is tipped to be an autumn hit that will earn director Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m his second Oscar nomination. Juliette Binoche, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina and Hallstr\u00f6m's wife, Lena Olin, star in the film of the book which has turned into a literary phenomenon, transforming the life of the French teacher from Barnsley who wrote it. Harris, 36, penned the novel after she lost patience with her husband, Kevin, spending nights in front of the television watching football. 'It's what men like doing,' he said. 'Women like eating chocolate.' Less than two years later, Harris has become the North of England's most unlikely purveyor of sex, chocolate and big screen success. Chocolat has sold in 23 countries worldwide and made the Whitbread Novel of the Year shortlist. It is still in the paperback bestsellers' list - more than a year after it was published - and it is set to stay there for another year when the movie version is released. Only J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter novels have enjoyed greater success. Chocolat tells the story of a beautiful stranger, Vianne Rocher, played by Binoche, who walks into the fictional village of Lansquenet, between Bordeaux and Toulouse, and opens a chocolate shop in Lent, despite the opposition of the village priest who believes in self-denial. It is not long before the shop's chocolate 'Nipples of Venus' begin to transform the village. People fall in love, dance and carouse. Vianne, herself, falls for a gypsy called Roux, played by Depp. It is all too much for the pious mayor, played by Molina, who tells Binoche, 'You and your idiot chocolate, get out!' The theme of the book is transformation and joy. 'There isn't enough around,' Harris said recently. 'I live in Barnsley. If I want gritty realism, all I have to do is look out of my window. People forget that there are simple pleasures out there which are not going to change your life, but are worth experiencing.' The book did not sell at first, but its popularity spread by word of mouth.

People started talking about it and one day you walked on to a train and there were loads of people - mainly women - reading it.' As its popularity grew, one reviewer asked: 'Is this the best book ever written?' Chocolat is likely to put Gascony on the map in the same way that Captain Corelli's Mandolin made Cephalonia a literary tourist's hotspot and Thailand's Koh Samui became the place to go for fans of The Beach . Harris has made enough money to quit her job and spend her time growing her own vegetables and cooking. 'I worry terribly about people who don't eat. They don't know how to live. Like the priest in Chocolat .' She describes the money she has earned as 'nice' but insists she 'has not acquired bestselling author's behaviour patterns'.

Sure, it's stereotyping, but Winstone has been more often seen on the other side of the law. In the impressively complex ITV drama Tough Love Winstone is excellent as a detective trying to work out if his best friend and boss (Adrian Dunbar) is bent.

At the age of 43, this is only the second time Winstone has strayed from his native London tones. 'I was never asked to do accents before, but by the time I got to an age when I was asked to do one, I was a bit bottley, because I thought \"can't do it\". Don't think they even really wanted me to do Mancunian, but it should be, it's gotta be.' </p> <p>Winstone has become a bit of an icon in recent years.In a film and TV world packed with mockneys, he is the real thing: Hackney-born, Enfield-raised, a lifelong West Ham fan whose parents sold fruit and veg. He was an amateur boxer as a teenager. 'I had 88 fights and I had a doctor say to me: there's no way you can do 88 fights and not be damaged.' After boxing he tried drama school; he was about to be kicked out when the visionary TV director Alan Clarke cast him in the borstal drama Scum (1977). </p> <p>The Clarke connection came good 20 years later when fellow Clarke-alumnus Gary Oldman wrote the role of a wife-beater in Nil By Mouth (1997) for Winstone, even though the two had never met. It changed Winstone's life. 'I was seeing people who wouldn't employ me three years earlier. I haven't got any hang-ups about that. But I was piddling about before.' Despite the subject matter, he loved doing the film. 'It was a doddle. I don't take it home. How can you take home beating up Kathy Burke? Go home to the wife: \"Cup of tea, dear?\" \"No, you can't have one.\" Smash! Fucking leave off: I'd be divorced... 'Course, I could be lying to you.' </p> <p>Another Clarke disciple, Tim Roth, chose him to play the abusive father in The War Zone . Winstone found that tougher, but not troubling. 'Good therapy. I know I've got no worries with myself.' Of course, there has been less celebrated stuff, most recently the much-ridiculed films Final Cut and Love, Honour And Obey. But given the chance, he's a fearless and brilliant actor.

      "body": "<p>We're not promising obvious fireworks. After a disappointing year, the autumn isn't offering up the usual collection of big-budget entertainment. Aside from Wonder Boys, director Curtis Hanson's impressive follow-up to LA Confidential, which stars Michael Douglas as an unravelling college professor, there are fewer familiar faces than usual. So we're left with a line-up of films that might not immediately grab your attention. But that is actually a good thing. After all, what would you rather see: a much-hyped film made by people you already know about, or something equally good from somebody completely new? </p> <p>The relative lack of cinematic big hitters with new product in the coming months means that a handful of interesting debuts - and a couple of second films from directors you're unlikely to have heard of - will have a chance of getting some attention. And they're about some unlikely subjects too: a female boxer, a boy growing up during the 1984-85 miners strike who wants to be a ballet dancer, a man with no memory. </p> <p>Let's start there. As everyone (rightly) turned on the underachieving British film industry towards the end of last year, a film called Following sneaked out. It was a black-and-white, Kubrick-influenced thriller about a man who was trailing other people. One of the producers claimed, rather pointlessly, that it was the cheapest feature film ever made in this country. But what mattered was that the few people who saw it wouldn't stop talking about it. By that point, director Christopher Nolan had already decamped to the US. The result is Memento, a film with a real budget ($10 million or so), and real stars (Guy Pearce, The Matrix 's Carrie Anne Moss). It's Nolan's chance to come good on all the promise that Following showed. Not that it is an easy film: the story - a man with no memory trying to work out how his wife died - is told backwards. But already it's generating the same kind of excitement as Following, only on a rather less subterranean scale. Proof that this country still produces truly ambitious filmmakers. </p> <p>James Gray is also on his second film: he made Little Odessa a long six years ago, without shaking the world. Yet he has pulled together an even more impressive cast nevertheless: The Yards matches the glamorous young - Mark Wahlberg, Joaquin Phoenix, Charlize Theron - with James Caan, Ellen Burstyn and Faye Dunaway. A moody look at crime in New York City, The Yards played well in Cannes and has a lot going for it. The question is whether Gray is reviving the spirit of gritty Seventies Hollywood, or simply recycling it. </p> <p>Using Caan seems to be the mini-trend of the season, because he's also in The Way Of The Gun. Presumably he has been forgiven for his appearance in the unspeakable Mickey Blue Eyes. Christopher McQuarrie has never directed before, but he did write The Usual Suspects. Scriptwriters are always complaining that directors are given total authorial credit for a film, for no real reason other than journalistic laziness. And it is true that you can see more of The Usual Suspects here than in the movies (Apt Pupil, X-Men) that director Bryan Singer has gone on to make. Want twists? Want plot, more plot and intriguing tangents that might or might not lead somewhere? A surfeit of style? McQuarrie is clearly your guy. </p> <p>We're far enough away from the post-Tarantino glut to greet another wordy, ostentatiously clever US thriller with excitement rather than weariness. But that's all still Hollywood. Beyond Hollywood, there still are very different worlds, or rather something a little closer to the real world. Such as a film already described in this paper as 'Ken Loach does West Side Story ' and another that could actually be tagged as a Loachian take on Rocky without bending the truth unduly. One gives a vivid sense of Britain during the miners strike(Billy Elliot), the other does the same for the Projects of the South Bronx (Girlfight). Both are debuts. </p> <p> Girlfight is directed by Karyn Kusama, but, tellingly, the executive producer is John Sayles, and it owes something to his feel for meticulous, patient realism. In truth, the plot leans a little too far to the conventional sports movie: girl wants to box, has to sneak around father's back to do so, finds mentor, confronts the backward sporting authorities, and so on. But the way the film works is anything but cliched: 22-year-old Michelle Rodriguez, who plays the central character, has never acted before. She is absolutely extraordinary. You don't doubt for a second that she could knock a guy flat, but you also buy into every conflicting emotion she has. It's the performance of the season. What's not clear is whether the film business will find a way to give Rodriguez the chances she deserves. </p> <p>As the story of a pit village boy who wants to be a ballet dancer, Billy Elliot is a similarly improbable plot within a very grounded setting. Stephen Daldry seems to be finding the switch from the theatre to film as logical as Sam Mendes did. </p> <p>The Loach theme doesn't extend to Road Trip, though. You might expect a touch of social realism when an award-winning documentary maker directs his first feature, but maybe not after you discover that Todd Phillips's Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner was called Frat House . And so, yes, his fictional debut Road Trip is a comedy about sex-obsessed college boys. But there are good obnoxious college movies and bad ones, and this is a good one. Phillips may not be a major auteur in the making in the way that Christopher Nolan is, but his grasp of pace and timingis first class. </p> <p>Of course, established directors aren't completely absent from the picture. There's Wong Kar Wei's terrific In The Mood For Love; Wonder Boys, Curtis Hanson's long awaited follow-up to LA Confidential; Terence Davies's Edith Wharton adaptation House Of Mirth, which stars Gillian Anderson; and James Toback's Black And White. But none of them will give the sense of discovery you get from Girlfight, or Memento, the feeling that this is something you haven't seen before. Which is why a seemingly quiet time for films should turn out to be very exciting after all. </p> <p><strong>The Screen awards: the season's hits (and misses)</strong></p> <p><strong>The 'aren't you a bit young' award for precocious talent</strong></p> <p>\u009514-year old Jamie Bell (above) acts and dances in Billy Elliot</p> <p>\u0095 Michelle Rodgriuez acts and punches in Girlfight</p> <p>\u0095 Posh high schoolers misbehave in Manhattan (Black and White) </p> <p><strong>Arthur Conan Doyle award for most unlikely sleuth</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu in Charlie's Angels</p> <p>\u0095 Ben Stiller in Black and White</p> <p>\u0095 Winona Ryder in Lost Souls </p> <p><strong>Tagline of the season</strong></p> <p>\u0095 'Meet the Devil.

The action takes place over the course of a wild weekend after his exasperated wife leaves him, and Douglas embarks on a substance-fuelled journey of discovery aided and abetted by Maguire, his oddball star writing pupil. Douglas is no stranger to playing morally compromised characters (Fatal Attraction, Wall Street), and is alternately charming and childish in the lead.

      "bodyText": "1 Wonder Boys The stars: Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, Frances McDormand, Robert Downey Jr The pitch: Michael Douglas acts his age What it is: Adapted from Michael Chabon's novel, it's a freewhelling film about a crumbling novelist/lecturer (Douglas), his lover (McDormand), his star student (Maguire) and his very camp agent (Downey). The action takes place over the course of a wild weekend after his exasperated wife leaves him, and Douglas embarks on a substance-fuelled journey of discovery aided and abetted by Maguire, his oddball star writing pupil. Douglas is no stranger to playing morally compromised characters (Fatal Attraction, Wall Street), and is alternately charming and childish in the lead. It is director Curtis Hanson's first film since LA Confidential and is something of a labour of love for the journeyman-turned-A list auteur. The prospects: This low-key film isn't exactly what everyone was expecting after the scale and complexity of LA Confidential , but it has a wonderful cast and witty script.

Early last month, Downey Jnr was released after serving 12 months of a three-year sentence for jumping probation on drugs charges. His early release, it seemed, had a good deal to do with a Vanity Fair profile which detailed his life behind bars alongside the likes of 'Sugar Bear' and 'Big Al', not to mention the attentions of a 'pre-op transexual'. For more than a couple of decades, the 35-year-old Downey Jnr's life has resembled a cheap melodrama. Son of a hippy, he smoked his first joint at eight, and graduated into a teenage of genuine excess while his peers were still boasting of the odd drunken binge. By the time he reached his thirties, the mishaps turned increasingly comic, most vividly when after one night on the town, he found himself in the wrong house, and collapsed into the bed of his neighbour's eleven-year-old son. Amid the endless shenanigans, one thing never in doubt was his talent. On Downey Jnr's release from prison, Robert Altman, who directed him in Short Cuts, said, 'If I had another role for him right now, I wouldn't give it a second thought to call him.' Downey Jnr hit fame while in his teens, when he secured a slot on Saturday Night Live. Richard Attenborough's Chaplin allowed him to show his repertoire of skills but the film was plodding. This became something of a theme: his performances often better than the films. Wonder Boys, which he filmed before his stay inside, promises more. What's not new is the hi-jinks - this time in the form of a camp literary agent. You don't employ Downey Jnr and ask him to play quiet.",

      "body": "<p>What next, after the mighty wrecking ball finally sets about Wembley, Venue of Legends and the Legless?</p> <p> I foresee Ken Bates, the FA's supremo of unbuilt stadiums, stumbling into the gallery of Millennium cock-ups alongside Peter Mandelson of the Dying Dome and Ove Arup, who built the Shake-Rattle-and-Roll Bridge over the Thames to the Tate Modern gallery. </p> <p>How can it be otherwise for Bates, when every estimate climbs like a maddened rocket? The talk a few years back was of \u00a3200 million for a gleaming colosseum to house World Cups and an Olympic Games. </p> <p>Last year that more than doubled to \u00a3103 million for the land plus \u00a3320 million for rebuilding - and the Olympics had fallen off the inventory. It's football only. The price leapt to \u00a3465 million earlier this year. Now I hear \u00a3600 million for construction, which, you can be sure, will be closer to a billion by the laying of the last brick. </p> <p>Yet what will ordinary spectators really gain? Cosier seats, unobstructed views, escalators everywhere and, in a little touch of luxury, the end of urinals that rot their shoes. The public of 2000AD are entitled to take such modifications for granted. </p> <p>But Nike Stadium, Tesco Towers, Ken's Kingdom or whatever they dub New Wembley will remain outdated and unsatisfactory until shifted from the horrible inconvenience of being jammed between residential areas and industrial estates; a clogged warren that entangles drivers who enter and which can delay them until nearly midnight when going home. </p> <p>Tubes and trains are over-crowded, scruffy, and uncomfortable. Sometimes threatening. Police protection? You're on your own! Parking? Best to come by coach or to get yourself elected to the FA Council, whose members and cronies enjoy guaranteed parking and kill time after matches in a dining hall with cosy bars. </p> <p>It's like First World War generals feasting in an out-of-range chateau without a care for the poor sods (read fans, in this case) at the front. The analogy is closer than you may think, for the segregation of supporters and officialdom has persisted since Wembley opened in 1923, not a full five years after the boys came marching home. </p> <p>Why don't the FA uproot themselves from Wembley? Partly because they are scared of straying outside the M25 - which is like a blanket around them. They might get nosebleeds letting go. Also the various MPs, diplomats and other influential poncers of tickets feel uneasy if too far from the West End. </p> <p>Yet land is cheaper on the far side of the motorway, and the M25 is ringed by planning officers prepared to use every legitimate inducement that might capture a national stadium for their community. In the Seventies, for instance, 100 acres outside Watford were offered in vain to the FA for a new Wembley plus a soccer school and training quarters. </p> <p>Much more recently, some 200 acres of the old Hatfield aerodrome (where Steven Spielberg shot battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan ) were identified for the Minister of Sport as available for erecting the greatest arena in Britain, some 20 miles from London with motorway access and fast trains to King's Cross and the North. </p> <p>In fairness to the FA, it has to be realised that soccer finals and a sprinkling of internationals alone cannot meet the full costs of running a stadium. Wembley itself was no goldmine, being sold in the late Twenties (after a bankrupted buyer killed himself) for less than a sixth of what it cost to build. A syndicate bought it outright for \u00a3122,500 and began scuffling for a regular income from new sports. </p> <p>Dog-racing (50,000 for the first meeting) was followed by speedway (average gates of 19,000 one season) and then by the building in 1934 of the Empire Pool as a year-round showcase for boxing, ice hockey, skating spectaculars and the Harlem Globetrotters with Wilt 'the Stilt' Chamberlain and 'Meadowlark' Lemon always playing basketball against a team called simply The Opposition. Mainly white and never allowed to win. </p> <p>They were all stars in their way. Chick Zanuck, a tempestuous competitor on ice. All the Globetrotters. Heavyweights Jack Petersen and Len Harvey meeting at Wembley for the British title, which Petersen retained on points over 15 rounds. </p> <p>But the stadium's truly great stars, drawing crowds the country could only marvel at, were outdoors on the stadium's football pitch. This was proved beyond argument in Wembley's inaugural match: Bolton Wanderers v West Ham in the 1923 FA Cup Final. The Policeman on the White Horse final. The game that brought us Bubbles , music hall hit of the year when adopted by the Hammers as still the most tuneful and wryest of club songs. </p> <p>Statisticians never admit to guesswork, but their gate figure of 126,047 is sheer conjecture - and probably wrong by a whopping 70,000. The stadium's official report says: 'The total may have exceeded 200,000.' </p> <p>Mistake No 1: It was pay at the gate. Mistake No 2: Admission was ridiculously cheap at only a florin (10p today). Mistake No.3: The gates and barriers were frail. They shut at 1.45pm but were smashed and swept aside in minutes. </p> <p>By 2.45,the pitch was black with people while the Grenadier and the Irish Guards band played unseen in the multitude. At 2.46, the FA's thoughts of an abandonment were squelched by King George the Fifth, an old sailor prone to salty language and saying in effect to fluttering officials: 'Bugger going home! Clear the damned pitch, instead!' </p> <p>Enter George Scorey on Billy. It was the first match the constable had seen and he never attended or watched another - yet remains indelibly in football history for bringing order into chaos. As he said later: 'The horse, being white, commanded attention and seemed to understand what was required. Also the crowd were good-tempered as he eased them back with his nose until we cleared the goal line.' </p> <p>David Jack scored for Bolton in the second minute. His shot with the old heavy casey whirred past goalkeeper Hufton before crashing into spectators (standing on the trampled netting of the Hammers' goal) and flattening them like dominoes. </p> <p>The teams spent half time on the pitch, there being no way off. Centre-forward John Smith then scored Bolton's second from a move begun by a spectator's pass. </p> <p>West Ham promptly demanded an abandonment. Bolton retorted: 'We'll play till dusk.' The ref waved play on and it finished 2-0. Next the FA entered a new term into football's language: 'All-ticket', which the final has been ever since. </p> <p>Oh Wembley, Wembley, Wembley, where I watched two Liverpool supporters kneeling on the pitch after the 1974 final and kissing Bill Shankly's shoes. But the range was too long to hear the great manager, quite unabashed, say: 'While you're down there, give them a good polish.' Oh Wembley, where I saw Danny Blanchflower captain the Spurs in the stadium's first League-and-Cup double final and 19-year-old Charlie George shoot Arsenal to parity of glory 10 years later. </p> <p>Wembley was where I saw the Liverpool and Manchester United doubles and the European Cup finals won there by both clubs. A couple of those six matches fell short of meriting the ecstasy exhibited by the supporters, but don't mention it to the players. As time goes by, all members of winning teams (as Shakespeare said in another context) 'remember with advantages'. Wembley, where I didn't see Fanny Blankers-Koen of Holland, 30 and a mum, win four gold medals. The 100 and 200 metres, the 80 metres hurdles and the 4 x 100 relay. She ran the anchor leg in the 1948 Olympics, the austerity games of Spam-fritter dinners, dried egg, meals in school halls and athletes housed in tents. </p> <p>It was also the games of Branislav Stankovic, left-back and silver medallist of Yugoslavia. 'Stinker' if modern headline writers had been at work when he was sent off in the final against Sweden. The first dismissal in Wembley history. You could win a quiz knowing that. </p> <p>Away with such villains and bring on more heroes. Shaun Edwards of Wigan playing in the Rugby League final against Warrington for an hour with a fractured cheek and saying nothing: 'I didn't want them to know I was hurt.' </p> <p>These were real men. I once found Great Britain's XIII in their dressing room getting stuck into beer after beating Australia 19-12. The sponsor's champagne? Washed their hair in it. I think of Michel Platini, several months retired and without any training apart from two sets of tennis, taking on a Football League Centenary XI and showing them how to play.</p> <p> I think of Pel\u00e9 and the pity that he never played any closer to Wembley than Craven Cottage in a testimonial. And what a nice touch if England invited him, as a Fifa ambassador and the only holder of three World Cup winners' medals, to do the honours for the old stadium's finale against Germany next month.</p> <p>I think of Bobby Moore and the last time I saw him, broadcasting from Wembley although knowing death was at his shoulder. I think of all the 1966 team - Gordon, George, Jackie, Bobby Moore, Ray, Alan, Bobby Charlton, Martin, Roger and Geoff - and feel somewhat disloyal for entertaining the idea that three years earlier even they had been outranked in Wembley stardom.</p> <p>It was June, a cool evening and I'm among a 53,000 crowd watching Elizabeth Taylor sashay down the steps to ringside on the turf. She appeared first and he, 21-year-old Cassius Clay, bounded into the spotlight wearing a rhinestone crown (although not yet a champ) and a red dressing-gown proclaiming 'Cassius the Greatest'. American reporters eyed him quizzically. Many of them believed he was gay. The same theory was being checked out by at least one Fleet Street newspaper, but events proved that young Cassius had a hungry look for Liz. He kept eyeing her over the ropes.</p> <p>Filling in time by dancing and pulling faces until carrying out his forecast of a fifth-round stoppage of the 'bum and cripple' opponent - in fact, British heavyweight champion Henry Cooper. The fourth was close to ending when Clay took a peek too many. Cooper's left fist, thrown from blood and desperation, left him sprawled through the ropes. Clay, by normal standards, was gone, yet he stood sort of upright at the bell almost nobody could hear in the din. </p> <p>Over and over, Angelo Dundee had warned; 'If there's one thing Cooper can do, it's to whack with the left hand.' Here the trainer wasted no time on recriminations, saying only 'Ice his balls' as the corner-men caught Cassius before he could fall. Dundee's attention was on a split in his man's left glove. </p> <p>He gave it an educated tug. The damage widened and a replacement was sanctioned. Strangely, there wasn't one anywhere, but the minute's delay was all Cassius needed. In two minutes and 15 seconds of the fifth, it was all over, with blood everywhere and thousands screaming 'Stop it'. </p> <p>Slurs on the sexuality of Cassius/ Muhammad began dying then and there. Soon team doctor Pacheco would jest about his fighter's recruitment by Black Muslims: 'He'll be a pelvic missionary.' And, two fights later, who should be ringside again for Ali's first round KO of Sonny Liston in Maine? Miss Taylor. </p> <p>What a fascinating Wembley memoir and well worth a picture on the Valhalla Board that the new stadium should be planning now if mindful of the warning that the country perishes which forgets its history. Footballers, of course, will dominate it. A shot, for instance of Dixie Dean, captain of Everton and, when only 20, scorer of 60 First Division goals in a season. He's receiving the FA Cup from the Queen Mum - and it's so long ago that she was still the Duchess of York. </p> <p>Stanley Matthews, leaning like a skier when aiming that decisive cross to Bill Perry, must be shown. Everyone from 1966 should be displayed and, if anybody can find it, the picture of Sir Alf Ramsey so concentrated on play that he's falling off the bench from which everyone else jumped to hail Geoff Hurst's clinching goal. In recognition of the most dazzling team that this stadium ever welcomed... a picture of Ferenc Puskas and his 1953 Hungarians. </p> <p>Come to think of it, we should show our English sportsmanship by similarly honouring every side who have defeated England at Wembley. To wit, Hungary, Sweden, Austria, West Germany, Italy, Holland, Spain, Brazil, Denmark, Russia, Uruguay, Germany, Chile and France.</p> <p>I realise this would also mean a long gallery of nine Scottish XIs but it could save the FA a fortune. For there's every chance of the Jocks showing their appreciation by demolishing Wembley for free, as they so nearly did in 1967 and 1977.</p>",

How can it be otherwise for Bates, when every estimate climbs like a maddened rocket? The talk a few years back was of \u00a3200 million for a gleaming colosseum to house World Cups and an Olympic Games. Last year that more than doubled to \u00a3103 million for the land plus \u00a3320 million for rebuilding - and the Olympics had fallen off the inventory. It's football only. The price leapt to \u00a3465 million earlier this year. Now I hear \u00a3600 million for construction, which, you can be sure, will be closer to a billion by the laying of the last brick. Yet what will ordinary spectators really gain? Cosier seats, unobstructed views, escalators everywhere and, in a little touch of luxury, the end of urinals that rot their shoes. The public of 2000AD are entitled to take such modifications for granted. But Nike Stadium, Tesco Towers, Ken's Kingdom or whatever they dub New Wembley will remain outdated and unsatisfactory until shifted from the horrible inconvenience of being jammed between residential areas and industrial estates; a clogged warren that entangles drivers who enter and which can delay them until nearly midnight when going home. Tubes and trains are over-crowded, scruffy, and uncomfortable. Sometimes threatening. Police protection? You're on your own! Parking? Best to come by coach or to get yourself elected to the FA Council, whose members and cronies enjoy guaranteed parking and kill time after matches in a dining hall with cosy bars. It's like First World War generals feasting in an out-of-range chateau without a care for the poor sods (read fans, in this case) at the front. The analogy is closer than you may think, for the segregation of supporters and officialdom has persisted since Wembley opened in 1923, not a full five years after the boys came marching home. Why don't the FA uproot themselves from Wembley? Partly because they are scared of straying outside the M25 - which is like a blanket around them. They might get nosebleeds letting go. Also the various MPs, diplomats and other influential poncers of tickets feel uneasy if too far from the West End. Yet land is cheaper on the far side of the motorway, and the M25 is ringed by planning officers prepared to use every legitimate inducement that might capture a national stadium for their community. In the Seventies, for instance, 100 acres outside Watford were offered in vain to the FA for a new Wembley plus a soccer school and training quarters. Much more recently, some 200 acres of the old Hatfield aerodrome (where Steven Spielberg shot battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan ) were identified for the Minister of Sport as available for erecting the greatest arena in Britain, some 20 miles from London with motorway access and fast trains to King's Cross and the North. In fairness to the FA, it has to be realised that soccer finals and a sprinkling of internationals alone cannot meet the full costs of running a stadium. Wembley itself was no goldmine, being sold in the late Twenties (after a bankrupted buyer killed himself) for less than a sixth of what it cost to build. A syndicate bought it outright for \u00a3122,500 and began scuffling for a regular income from new sports. Dog-racing (50,000 for the first meeting) was followed by speedway (average gates of 19,000 one season) and then by the building in 1934 of the Empire Pool as a year-round showcase for boxing, ice hockey, skating spectaculars and the Harlem Globetrotters with Wilt 'the Stilt' Chamberlain and 'Meadowlark' Lemon always playing basketball against a team called simply The Opposition. Mainly white and never allowed to win. They were all stars in their way. Chick Zanuck, a tempestuous competitor on ice. All the Globetrotters. Heavyweights Jack Petersen and Len Harvey meeting at Wembley for the British title, which Petersen retained on points over 15 rounds. But the stadium's truly great stars, drawing crowds the country could only marvel at, were outdoors on the stadium's football pitch. This was proved beyond argument in Wembley's inaugural match: Bolton Wanderers v West Ham in the 1923 FA Cup Final. The Policeman on the White Horse final. The game that brought us Bubbles , music hall hit of the year when adopted by the Hammers as still the most tuneful and wryest of club songs. Statisticians never admit to guesswork, but their gate figure of 126,047 is sheer conjecture - and probably wrong by a whopping 70,000. The stadium's official report says: 'The total may have exceeded 200,000.' Mistake No 1: It was pay at the gate. Mistake No 2: Admission was ridiculously cheap at only a florin (10p today). Mistake No.3: The gates and barriers were frail. They shut at 1.45pm but were smashed and swept aside in minutes. By 2.45,the pitch was black with people while the Grenadier and the Irish Guards band played unseen in the multitude. At 2.46, the FA's thoughts of an abandonment were squelched by King George the Fifth, an old sailor prone to salty language and saying in effect to fluttering officials: 'Bugger going home! Clear the damned pitch, instead!' Enter George Scorey on Billy. It was the first match the constable had seen and he never attended or watched another - yet remains indelibly in football history for bringing order into chaos. As he said later: 'The horse, being white, commanded attention and seemed to understand what was required. Also the crowd were good-tempered as he eased them back with his nose until we cleared the goal line.' David Jack scored for Bolton in the second minute. His shot with the old heavy casey whirred past goalkeeper Hufton before crashing into spectators (standing on the trampled netting of the Hammers' goal) and flattening them like dominoes. The teams spent half time on the pitch, there being no way off. Centre-forward John Smith then scored Bolton's second from a move begun by a spectator's pass. West Ham promptly demanded an abandonment. Bolton retorted: 'We'll play till dusk.' The ref waved play on and it finished 2-0. Next the FA entered a new term into football's language: 'All-ticket', which the final has been ever since. Oh Wembley, Wembley, Wembley, where I watched two Liverpool supporters kneeling on the pitch after the 1974 final and kissing Bill Shankly's shoes. But the range was too long to hear the great manager, quite unabashed, say: 'While you're down there, give them a good polish.' Oh Wembley, where I saw Danny Blanchflower captain the Spurs in the stadium's first League-and-Cup double final and 19-year-old Charlie George shoot Arsenal to parity of glory 10 years later. Wembley was where I saw the Liverpool and Manchester United doubles and the European Cup finals won there by both clubs. A couple of those six matches fell short of meriting the ecstasy exhibited by the supporters, but don't mention it to the players. As time goes by, all members of winning teams (as Shakespeare said in another context) 'remember with advantages'. Wembley, where I didn't see Fanny Blankers-Koen of Holland, 30 and a mum, win four gold medals. The 100 and 200 metres, the 80 metres hurdles and the 4 x 100 relay. She ran the anchor leg in the 1948 Olympics, the austerity games of Spam-fritter dinners, dried egg, meals in school halls and athletes housed in tents. It was also the games of Branislav Stankovic, left-back and silver medallist of Yugoslavia. 'Stinker' if modern headline writers had been at work when he was sent off in the final against Sweden. The first dismissal in Wembley history. You could win a quiz knowing that. Away with such villains and bring on more heroes. Shaun Edwards of Wigan playing in the Rugby League final against Warrington for an hour with a fractured cheek and saying nothing: 'I didn't want them to know I was hurt.' These were real men. I once found Great Britain's XIII in their dressing room getting stuck into beer after beating Australia 19-12. The sponsor's champagne? Washed their hair in it. I think of Michel Platini, several months retired and without any training apart from two sets of tennis, taking on a Football League Centenary XI and showing them how to play. I think of Pel\u00e9 and the pity that he never played any closer to Wembley than Craven Cottage in a testimonial. And what a nice touch if England invited him, as a Fifa ambassador and the only holder of three World Cup winners' medals, to do the honours for the old stadium's finale against Germany next month. I think of Bobby Moore and the last time I saw him, broadcasting from Wembley although knowing death was at his shoulder. I think of all the 1966 team - Gordon, George, Jackie, Bobby Moore, Ray, Alan, Bobby Charlton, Martin, Roger and Geoff - and feel somewhat disloyal for entertaining the idea that three years earlier even they had been outranked in Wembley stardom. It was June, a cool evening and I'm among a 53,000 crowd watching Elizabeth Taylor sashay down the steps to ringside on the turf. She appeared first and he, 21-year-old Cassius Clay, bounded into the spotlight wearing a rhinestone crown (although not yet a champ) and a red dressing-gown proclaiming 'Cassius the Greatest'. American reporters eyed him quizzically. Many of them believed he was gay. The same theory was being checked out by at least one Fleet Street newspaper, but events proved that young Cassius had a hungry look for Liz. He kept eyeing her over the ropes. Filling in time by dancing and pulling faces until carrying out his forecast of a fifth-round stoppage of the 'bum and cripple' opponent - in fact, British heavyweight champion Henry Cooper. The fourth was close to ending when Clay took a peek too many. Cooper's left fist, thrown from blood and desperation, left him sprawled through the ropes. Clay, by normal standards, was gone, yet he stood sort of upright at the bell almost nobody could hear in the din. Over and over, Angelo Dundee had warned; 'If there's one thing Cooper can do, it's to whack with the left hand.' Here the trainer wasted no time on recriminations, saying only 'Ice his balls' as the corner-men caught Cassius before he could fall. Dundee's attention was on a split in his man's left glove. He gave it an educated tug. The damage widened and a replacement was sanctioned. Strangely, there wasn't one anywhere, but the minute's delay was all Cassius needed. In two minutes and 15 seconds of the fifth, it was all over, with blood everywhere and thousands screaming 'Stop it'. Slurs on the sexuality of Cassius/ Muhammad began dying then and there. Soon team doctor Pacheco would jest about his fighter's recruitment by Black Muslims: 'He'll be a pelvic missionary.' And, two fights later, who should be ringside again for Ali's first round KO of Sonny Liston in Maine? Miss Taylor. What a fascinating Wembley memoir and well worth a picture on the Valhalla Board that the new stadium should be planning now if mindful of the warning that the country perishes which forgets its history. Footballers, of course, will dominate it. A shot, for instance of Dixie Dean, captain of Everton and, when only 20, scorer of 60 First Division goals in a season. He's receiving the FA Cup from the Queen Mum - and it's so long ago that she was still the Duchess of York. Stanley Matthews, leaning like a skier when aiming that decisive cross to Bill Perry, must be shown. Everyone from 1966 should be displayed and, if anybody can find it, the picture of Sir Alf Ramsey so concentrated on play that he's falling off the bench from which everyone else jumped to hail Geoff Hurst's clinching goal. In recognition of the most dazzling team that this stadium ever welcomed... a picture of Ferenc Puskas and his 1953 Hungarians. Come to think of it, we should show our English sportsmanship by similarly honouring every side who have defeated England at Wembley. To wit, Hungary, Sweden, Austria, West Germany, Italy, Holland, Spain, Brazil, Denmark, Russia, Uruguay, Germany, Chile and France. I realise this would also mean a long gallery of nine Scottish XIs but it could save the FA a fortune. For there's every chance of the Jocks showing their appreciation by demolishing Wembley for free, as they so nearly did in 1967 and 1977.",

They represent better value for our budget than anything else I have seen lately. </p> <p>I have some friends in South America who alerted us to the fact that the Hondurans have an up-and-coming team some time ago. The chairman, chief scout and myself all went over to watch them play. I saw three matches in a week and was impressed. They play a high-tempo style of football which will be well-suited to the English game. We also watched them in training and visited their hotel to see how they interacted with their team-mates and I expect they will fit in well. </p> <p>It will take a while for them to acclimatise before they are ready for first-team football. They have to improve their English, but they are working on it already, and it helps that Coventry have a few players who speak Spanish. Also, when you bring two over, they should help each other along. </p> <p>Work permits are a frustration. They have played the required number of international matches to qualify but that ruling also depends upon their country being in the top 70 of the Fifa rankings for two years. Although Honduras have made great strides they won't meet that particular requirement until next month. So we have to wait until we can apply for permits, during which time they have another World Cup game, and we should have them here by mid-October. It's amazing. I can't get a permit for a player from Honduras who are 45th in the world, yet no one bats an eyelid about us buying a \u00a36.5 million player (Craig Bellamy) from Wales, who lie 113th in the world. </p> <p>I don't believe we should be bringing players over from abroad at youth level because we should be encouraging homegrown British players to progress. It hasn't gone unnoticed that there are one or two young players at Highfield Road who I keep a close eye on. My sons, Gavin and Craig, are on the books. Gavin has just forced his way into the first team, and Craig played in the FA Youth Cup Final last season. </p> <p>Last week Gavin scored his first goal for the first team. It came as a surprise to me. We had a penalty, and although he's a confident boy and he takes penalties for the reserves, we have internationals in the squad who would normally take them. Watching on from the dugout my feelings were split - 80 per cent manager and 20 per cent father. </p> <p>People will make accusations of nepotism but I simply try to do what is best for the team. Gavin played against Aston Villa last season and we beat them for the first time in over 100 years at Villa Park, so it can't have been such an unreasonable decision. The pitch was wet and fast and he is comfortable with the ball at his feet, so I thought the game would suit him. Gavin plays for Scotland under-21s and Craig for the under-18s so judges other than me feel they have something. </p> <p>I am probably harder on them than on other players, rather than giving out any preferential treatment. They have to be themselves, to impose their own personality on the group. It's not easy for them, particularly because they cannot be seen as passing anything on to me. They live at home but that doesn't mean we are forever talking about football. Far from it. It's not a subject that gets an airing unless we happen to be watching a match on the television and we just have normal patter about how the game is going. They certainly don't want to listen to stories of my playing career. </p> <p>It doesn't cause a problem in the everyday life of the club or their development. In terms of coaching, Craig is under the watchful eye of the youth coaches, and if there is a specific point I want to make to Gavin I normally tell one of the other coaches and they pass it on. When it comes to contracts there's no uneasy predicaments there, either. I leave it to the chairman, as I do with any other player. </p> <p>Do they resemble me? Well, they are both non-goalscoring midfielders. The Russians once used to encourage sportsmen and sportswomen to marry in order to pass on the best possible genes to breed future athletes. My wife is taller than me, so that gives them something I couldn't.</p>",

It hasn't gone unnoticed that there are one or two young players at Highfield Road who I keep a close eye on. My sons, Gavin and Craig, are on the books. Gavin has just forced his way into the first team, and Craig played in the FA Youth Cup Final last season. Last week Gavin scored his first goal for the first team. It came as a surprise to me. We had a penalty, and although he's a confident boy and he takes penalties for the reserves, we have internationals in the squad who would normally take them. Watching on from the dugout my feelings were split - 80 per cent manager and 20 per cent father. People will make accusations of nepotism but I simply try to do what is best for the team. Gavin played against Aston Villa last season and we beat them for the first time in over 100 years at Villa Park, so it can't have been such an unreasonable decision. The pitch was wet and fast and he is comfortable with the ball at his feet, so I thought the game would suit him. Gavin plays for Scotland under-21s and Craig for the under-18s so judges other than me feel they have something. I am probably harder on them than on other players, rather than giving out any preferential treatment. They have to be themselves, to impose their own personality on the group. It's not easy for them, particularly because they cannot be seen as passing anything on to me. They live at home but that doesn't mean we are forever talking about football. Far from it. It's not a subject that gets an airing unless we happen to be watching a match on the television and we just have normal patter about how the game is going. They certainly don't want to listen to stories of my playing career. It doesn't cause a problem in the everyday life of the club or their development. In terms of coaching, Craig is under the watchful eye of the youth coaches, and if there is a specific point I want to make to Gavin I normally tell one of the other coaches and they pass it on. When it comes to contracts there's no uneasy predicaments there, either. I leave it to the chairman, as I do with any other player. Do they resemble me? Well, they are both non-goalscoring midfielders. The Russians once used to encourage sportsmen and sportswomen to marry in order to pass on the best possible genes to breed future athletes. My wife is taller than me, so that gives them something I couldn't.",

      "byline": "Ian Ridley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>They came to bury Claudio Ranieri not to praise him but this new Roman in Britain left Old Trafford stunned as his team fought back bravely and departed into the afternoon sunshine with an unexpected but potentially morale-lifting point. Perhaps this Caesar is the one to put an end to the back-stabbing at Chelsea. </p> <p>There was certainly backbone this time to a flash, brash outfit often so slick at home to such as West Ham and so vulnerable at Bradford City. The renewed heart was personified by Graeme Le Saux, still feeling his way back after long-term injury and vilified in the defeat by Leicester City last Sunday but a diminutive colossus yesterday, leading by example after being made captain by Ranieri, 'because he's English'. </p> <p>It was one shrewd move by Ranieri. The other came at half time when he withdrew Jon Harley, promising but lightweight, and put Mario Melchiot in to stiffen a previously overrun midfield and to curtail the damage that the evergreen Teddy Sheringham was doing from his withdrawn striking position behind Andy Cole. We will let it pass that Sheringham's role has been well-known to the English game for the last five years. </p> <p>After the Leicester defeat Ranieri's first task, he said after yesterday's match, was 'to bring back confidence to a team which had gone through traumatic times and try to convince them they were a good enough team to get results'. The response seemed immediate, in Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's well-directed strike. </p> <p>For we of lesser faith, Scotland v Brazil in 1982 sprang to mind, the Scots making their first mistake in taking the lead similarly spectacularly to stir the Brazilians into a 4-1 win. Duly, for 30 minutes United were stung into their familiar industrious and flowing football, the ball transferred thrillingly at pace; control instant, finishing certain, Christian Panucci swamped by Ryan Giggs's runs. </p> <p>We thought the real United had stood up; the real Chelsea had lain down. In United's second goal was it especially evident. Coaches yell 'no bounce' at schoolboys when defending a high ball, so they will attack and clear it to avoid the panic the bouncing ball can create. Chelsea allowed David Beckham's chipped ball forward to bounce no fewer than three times before it was drilled home by Sheringham. It will have gone into Ranieri's jumbo-sized notebook. </p> <p>Raimond van der Gouw's error let in Tore Andre Flo's header, another triumph for Ranieri's tactics, Flo lining up wide on the right to exploit the weak link of Mikael Silvestre by cutting inside the full-back to meet a cross. Sir Alex Ferguson pinpointed it as the turning point, his dressing room subdued at the interval, the visitors' buoyant. Inside it, Ranieri told his team that he wanted to see 'the same spirit as Manchester United'. </p> <p>He got it - Gianfranco Zola even cleared from right back. </p> <p>Actually there was another turning point, Le Saux scooping Cole's shot athletically off the line. Within minutes he was at the byline at the other end to cross for Chelsea's equaliser, his third goal creation. It was significant that he went past David Beckham to do so. There can be no higher praise than that he eclipsed the man he was marking for most of the match. If we were surprised, Sir Alex wasn't. 'With their record against us and under a new coach, I thought they would be pumped up.' </p> <p>There are two flaws with United sometimes. Without Jaap Stam, their air of defensive invulnerability disappears. In addition, the Premiership can seem to easy to them. Boredom and complacency can seep in when they lead comfortably. Chelsea were fortunate on both counts yesterday. Reality should intrude. </p> <p>For all their heartening efforts, it remains only a point and they remain this year's 'big team in crisis' traditional at this time of the season. Ken Bates and his club will discover over the coming weeks the truth or otherwise of Shakespeare's other observation in Julius Caesar that 'the evil that men do lives after them'.</p>",

      "bodyText": "They came to bury Claudio Ranieri not to praise him but this new Roman in Britain left Old Trafford stunned as his team fought back bravely and departed into the afternoon sunshine with an unexpected but potentially morale-lifting point. Perhaps this Caesar is the one to put an end to the back-stabbing at Chelsea. There was certainly backbone this time to a flash, brash outfit often so slick at home to such as West Ham and so vulnerable at Bradford City. The renewed heart was personified by Graeme Le Saux, still feeling his way back after long-term injury and vilified in the defeat by Leicester City last Sunday but a diminutive colossus yesterday, leading by example after being made captain by Ranieri, 'because he's English'. It was one shrewd move by Ranieri. The other came at half time when he withdrew Jon Harley, promising but lightweight, and put Mario Melchiot in to stiffen a previously overrun midfield and to curtail the damage that the evergreen Teddy Sheringham was doing from his withdrawn striking position behind Andy Cole. We will let it pass that Sheringham's role has been well-known to the English game for the last five years. After the Leicester defeat Ranieri's first task, he said after yesterday's match, was 'to bring back confidence to a team which had gone through traumatic times and try to convince them they were a good enough team to get results'. The response seemed immediate, in Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's well-directed strike. For we of lesser faith, Scotland v Brazil in 1982 sprang to mind, the Scots making their first mistake in taking the lead similarly spectacularly to stir the Brazilians into a 4-1 win. Duly, for 30 minutes United were stung into their familiar industrious and flowing football, the ball transferred thrillingly at pace; control instant, finishing certain, Christian Panucci swamped by Ryan Giggs's runs. We thought the real United had stood up; the real Chelsea had lain down. In United's second goal was it especially evident. Coaches yell 'no bounce' at schoolboys when defending a high ball, so they will attack and clear it to avoid the panic the bouncing ball can create. Chelsea allowed David Beckham's chipped ball forward to bounce no fewer than three times before it was drilled home by Sheringham. It will have gone into Ranieri's jumbo-sized notebook. Raimond van der Gouw's error let in Tore Andre Flo's header, another triumph for Ranieri's tactics, Flo lining up wide on the right to exploit the weak link of Mikael Silvestre by cutting inside the full-back to meet a cross. Sir Alex Ferguson pinpointed it as the turning point, his dressing room subdued at the interval, the visitors' buoyant. Inside it, Ranieri told his team that he wanted to see 'the same spirit as Manchester United'. He got it - Gianfranco Zola even cleared from right back. Actually there was another turning point, Le Saux scooping Cole's shot athletically off the line. Within minutes he was at the byline at the other end to cross for Chelsea's equaliser, his third goal creation. It was significant that he went past David Beckham to do so. There can be no higher praise than that he eclipsed the man he was marking for most of the match. If we were surprised, Sir Alex wasn't. 'With their record against us and under a new coach, I thought they would be pumped up.' There are two flaws with United sometimes. Without Jaap Stam, their air of defensive invulnerability disappears. In addition, the Premiership can seem to easy to them. Boredom and complacency can seep in when they lead comfortably. Chelsea were fortunate on both counts yesterday. Reality should intrude. For all their heartening efforts, it remains only a point and they remain this year's 'big team in crisis' traditional at this time of the season. Ken Bates and his club will discover over the coming weeks the truth or otherwise of Shakespeare's other observation in Julius Caesar that 'the evil that men do lives after them'.",

Indeed, the front pair created the best opportunity of that period between themselves. </p> <p>Sutton took a quick free-kick which released Larsson into the penalty area on the left, but, with only Robert Douglas to beat from 10 yards, the Swede uncharacteristically miscued his left-foot shot, scooping the ball just over the bar.

The goalkeeper, not entirely surprisingly, fumbled it back into space and Larsson just beat Lee Wilkie in the chase to push it back towards goal. Douglas managed to deflect the Swede's effort for a corner. </p> <p>Celtic's growing superiority was more subtle than breathtaking, but allowed their followers to anticipate their breakthrough. It was Thompson who did the construction work, carrying the ball through the inside left channel and delivering a perfect chip to Petrov on the six-yard line.

      "body": "<p>The shocks keep coming thick and fast in the Premiership. It was hard to decide what was most jaw-dropping here, Manchester United letting a 3-1 lead slip at home or the wholly unexpected revelation that Chelsea possess guts. </p> <p>On reflection, perhaps the most pleasant surprise was that the stand-out performers were both Englishmen. Graeme Le Saux was a strong contender for man of the match after setting up all three Chelsea goals, just shading Teddy Sheringham who was involved in all three of United's. </p> <p>Le Saux, who also made an important clearance off the line to prevent United taking a 4-2 lead in the second half, should be a certainty in the England squad Kevin Keegan announces on Thursday. Sheringham's England days are thought to be over, but there is no doubt he is in the United team on merit and enjoying some of the most productive form of his career.

      "bodyText": "The shocks keep coming thick and fast in the Premiership. It was hard to decide what was most jaw-dropping here, Manchester United letting a 3-1 lead slip at home or the wholly unexpected revelation that Chelsea possess guts. On reflection, perhaps the most pleasant surprise was that the stand-out performers were both Englishmen. Graeme Le Saux was a strong contender for man of the match after setting up all three Chelsea goals, just shading Teddy Sheringham who was involved in all three of United's. Le Saux, who also made an important clearance off the line to prevent United taking a 4-2 lead in the second half, should be a certainty in the England squad Kevin Keegan announces on Thursday. Sheringham's England days are thought to be over, but there is no doubt he is in the United team on merit and enjoying some of the most productive form of his career. Claudio Ranieri, the new Chelsea coach who pronounced himself 'very satisfied' with his team's efforts to match United's team spirit, paid Sheringham the compliment of reshuffling his defence at half time because of the damage he was doing behind the midfield line. In the absence of stomach-bug victim Dennis Wise, Ranieri promoted Le Saux to the captaincy, 'because he is English'.

For every Manchester United creating a mythical 'theatre of dreams', there is a Wolverhampton Wanderers bowed down by the wait of expectations. </p> <p>And, if the truth be told, even the faithful don't truly believe at Molineux any more. The days are long gone when Sir Jack Hayward promised he would lead his club to the Premiership land of plenty. Instead fans are resigned to another season of mid-table mediocrity. </p> <p>Indeed there is still a chance that it could be somewhat worse than that. Currently 18th in the league, Wolves today host Norwich City, lying 20th, in a game that could already be billed as a relegation six-pointer. </p> <p>Wolves boss Colin Lee, under-fire from certain sections of the home support after two years of management has seen him promise much but deliver little, admits as much. 'We know it is an important match,' he said. 'Of course it's too early to be talking about a crisis but it's certainly a game we have to win.' </p> <p>Lee has never been the luckiest of managers, but this season he has been hit by an injury crisis that would make even Gerry Francis blanch. </p> <p>Wolves are without a recognised centre half, last year's outstanding player, Ludovic Pollet, is injured and they are also minus Harvard Flo, George Ndah, Steve Sedgley, Simon Osbourn and Scott Taylor.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes history can be as much a burden as a blessing. For every Manchester United creating a mythical 'theatre of dreams', there is a Wolverhampton Wanderers bowed down by the wait of expectations. And, if the truth be told, even the faithful don't truly believe at Molineux any more. The days are long gone when Sir Jack Hayward promised he would lead his club to the Premiership land of plenty. Instead fans are resigned to another season of mid-table mediocrity. Indeed there is still a chance that it could be somewhat worse than that. Currently 18th in the league, Wolves today host Norwich City, lying 20th, in a game that could already be billed as a relegation six-pointer. Wolves boss Colin Lee, under-fire from certain sections of the home support after two years of management has seen him promise much but deliver little, admits as much. 'We know it is an important match,' he said. 'Of course it's too early to be talking about a crisis but it's certainly a game we have to win.' Lee has never been the luckiest of managers, but this season he has been hit by an injury crisis that would make even Gerry Francis blanch. Wolves are without a recognised centre half, last year's outstanding player, Ludovic Pollet, is injured and they are also minus Harvard Flo, George Ndah, Steve Sedgley, Simon Osbourn and Scott Taylor. Captain Kevin Muscat is suspended along with promising youngster Joleon Lescourt. And Lee, who may be forced to play new signing midfielder Tony Dinning in defence, admits his side would settle for a point. 'We are playing through such a big injury crisis that all we can hope for at the moment is to pick up the occasional point here and there,' he said. I think our fans have to understand the extent of the injury crisis is so great that we can only hope to play through it and make up the points later on.' Still it is not all doom and gloom in the Black Country. Summer signing Georgian Temuri Ketsbaia may return after a late fitness test while Norwich old boy Robert Taylor is also in contention. Norwich, still struggling to come to terms with the \u00a36 million sale of Craig Bellamy to Coventry, have problems of their own. Bryan Hamilton's side have won only one game this season - 3-1 away at Stockport - and the former Northern Ireland manager admits today's match will be a difficult one. He said: 'Wolves might be going through an indifferent spell lately but they are still a big club and as such we know this will be a tough and competitive game.' Still if Lee and Hamilton think life is bad they could always take comfort from Paul Jewell's predicament at Sheffield Wednesday. Jewell's side took the lead thanks to a goal from Owen Morrison but then fell apart, losing 3-1 at home to Preston - an own goal by Des Walker a sign of just how the once-mighty have fallen. Former Manchester United great Steve Bruce may occasionally ponder the same problem. His Huddersfield side are still marooned at the bottom of the First Division after falling to their fifth consecutive home defeat. Life looks considerably more rosy for Watford who held on with 10 men against Stockport after Tommy Mooney's dismissal to stay in contention with Jean Tigana's seemingly unbeatable Fulham who strolled past Gillingham 3-0.

After last Sunday's 1-0 loss at Jaen, furious Gil told reporters: 'I will do anything in my power to get us out of this situation: become a priest, dress up as a nun, or take holy vows every day.' And, of course, sack all the staff. </p> <p>Gil had promised frustrated fans a spectacular return to the top flight within a season: during the summer club billboards around Madrid carried posters headlined 'Manchester United and Milan have been down there, too' above an image of Atletico icon Kiko against a backdrop of flames, and a slogan: 'Atletico Madrid: Let's make it just one year in hell.' 38,000 fans responded by buying season tickets - the highest figure in 13 years and 14,000 more than the previous season. 'This is a social phenomenon,' Gil said in August. 'With this kind of backing we must go straight back up.' Coach Zambrano, though, had other ideas: 'We must not get carried away: if we want promotion we have to look at ourselves in the mirror every morning and repeat: We are a second-division team, we are a second-division team, we are a second-division team.' </p> <p>The mantra seems to have taken hold - and Gil has already put Frenchman Luis Fernandez on standby to become his twenty-fourth manager in 13 years.

According to the story, Alex Ferguson was so keen to find an alternative to Bosnich before buying Fabien Barthez that he even tried to sign Carlos 'Lettuce' Roa - Argentine keeper turned vegetarian Seventh Day Adventist who, fairly importantly, refuses to play football on Saturdays. The story first ran in the Mirror last year, and turned up again in the Sun last week - almost as though someone, somewhere, was trying to humiliate the Australian cash cow by keeping the story current.

'Steve did not want to leave when we first received a bid in August but sooner or later he'll have to,' said president Florentino Perez. And coach Vicente Del Bosque wants rid of the scouser now, giving him a shop-window walk-on role against Malaga last week.

      "body": "<p>There is nothing more daunting than trying to replace a legend. Who now remembers the Blackpool right-winger who followed Stanley Matthews or the playmaker who took the shirt from Bobby Charlton at Manchester United? So what chance has the new Wembley, following in the shadow of the old Empire Stadium with its twin towers? </p> <p>Probably not much, actually. Already questions are being asked such as: will it be as good as the Stade de France? Is it likely to be much better than Old Trafford? Or even Arsenal's planned replacement for Highbury? </p> <p>When the stadium was built in 1923 such contemporary comparisons were unnecessary. Wembley was compared favourably with the Roman Colosseum - Wembley was bigger, of course - and the amphitheatre at Nimes. It was then the finest stadium in the world and there must be doubt, already, if the new stadium will ever be called that. </p> <p>When I was commissioned to write Wembley's story, I found that the reality of Wembley matched the legend and indeed the title of the book, The Greatest Stage, because of the great events and performers that have been through its doors - and not merely football. The affection the old stadium is held in by many great stars is powerful testimony. </p> <p>But time has been running out for the old stadium for years. The Taylor Report which followed the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, was crucial to Wembley's fate. Once Wembley was turned all-seat it became all too obvious that the place was designed with terracing in mind. And, when people sit to watch a sporting event, they don't feel so intimately involved with what's happening. So what do they do? They look around... and when they started looking around at Wembley, it became obvious that the place was tatty. </p> <p>And then there is the question of the towers, and what a vexed question it became. When I started writing the Wembley book, it was still thought the towers would be retained in some form, to give the new stadium a gateway or some link with the old ground. Not now - it was decided it was impossible to retain the towers. </p> <p>That is a big decision because Wembley, in so many ways, is the twin towers. They are the stamp of the place - they are the stadium architectural equivalent of the Coke bottle. Unique and instantly recognisable. </p> <p>It may be the people who are now running, designing and building the new Wembley do not think it is important that a sense of tradition from the world's most famous stadium is carried forward into the new development. They may not think that the cachet associated with the towers is crucial. If not, fair enough - but surely retaining the towers in some way would have been the perfect way to link the past with the future. </p> <p>Down the years, there have been some fantastic moments. Football, of course, is in the vanguard, and FA Cup final day is synonymous with the old ground. It may not be with the new one as the importance of the cups in English football has diminished. But for 30 years or more after it was built, winning the Cup at Wembley was just as important for our top clubs as winning the league title. </p> <p>Something happened, perhaps in the late Fifties when there was a string of finals ruined by injuries (substitutes were not then allowed), to dilute that importance. That - and the ending of the maximum wage - made the league much more important. </p> <p>But Cup final day stayed special. My first taste of Wembley as an Arsenal fan came in 1968, unhappily, when we lost to Leeds in the League Cup. Three years later in 1971 came my favourite memory - Arsenal beating Liverpool in the FA Cup final to complete the Double. I was one of 30,000 Arsenal fans who all swear to being dead in line with Charlie George when he struck his spectacular winner. </p> <p>Another final, the 1969 League Cup won by Swindon - 3-1 - against Arsenal, produced an underdog hero in winger Don Rogers. He now runs a sports shop in the West Country and, when we spoke, he told me that six people a week, some from overseas, still seek him out to talk about how he scored twice and won the Cup for Swindon. That fame, that legend, was made possible only by Wembley. </p> <p>The 1948 Olympics were key to the Wembley story. The Games led to the construction of the modern Wembley Way with the flyover bridge; the modern tunnel, too, with the dressing rooms behind, were constructed for the Games. Before that, players emerged from a tunnel at roughly two o'clock from the 'new' one - and the original area is still used for vehicular access. </p> <p>Now the time's almost up. What will happen? Who knows, but I very much doubt if the new Wembley will last close to 80 years. If they manage to capture the spirit and ethos of the old place it may have a chance. </p> <p>It's misguided to think now of the old Wembley as the world's greatest ground. What it became, and remains, is the most famous stadium in the world. That's what the new Wembley, in all its hi-tech gloss and modernity, has to aspire to.</p>",

The Taylor Report which followed the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, was crucial to Wembley's fate. Once Wembley was turned all-seat it became all too obvious that the place was designed with terracing in mind. And, when people sit to watch a sporting event, they don't feel so intimately involved with what's happening. So what do they do? They look around... and when they started looking around at Wembley, it became obvious that the place was tatty. And then there is the question of the towers, and what a vexed question it became. When I started writing the Wembley book, it was still thought the towers would be retained in some form, to give the new stadium a gateway or some link with the old ground. Not now - it was decided it was impossible to retain the towers. That is a big decision because Wembley, in so many ways, is the twin towers. They are the stamp of the place - they are the stadium architectural equivalent of the Coke bottle. Unique and instantly recognisable. It may be the people who are now running, designing and building the new Wembley do not think it is important that a sense of tradition from the world's most famous stadium is carried forward into the new development. They may not think that the cachet associated with the towers is crucial. If not, fair enough - but surely retaining the towers in some way would have been the perfect way to link the past with the future. Down the years, there have been some fantastic moments. Football, of course, is in the vanguard, and FA Cup final day is synonymous with the old ground. It may not be with the new one as the importance of the cups in English football has diminished. But for 30 years or more after it was built, winning the Cup at Wembley was just as important for our top clubs as winning the league title. Something happened, perhaps in the late Fifties when there was a string of finals ruined by injuries (substitutes were not then allowed), to dilute that importance. That - and the ending of the maximum wage - made the league much more important. But Cup final day stayed special. My first taste of Wembley as an Arsenal fan came in 1968, unhappily, when we lost to Leeds in the League Cup. Three years later in 1971 came my favourite memory - Arsenal beating Liverpool in the FA Cup final to complete the Double. I was one of 30,000 Arsenal fans who all swear to being dead in line with Charlie George when he struck his spectacular winner. Another final, the 1969 League Cup won by Swindon - 3-1 - against Arsenal, produced an underdog hero in winger Don Rogers. He now runs a sports shop in the West Country and, when we spoke, he told me that six people a week, some from overseas, still seek him out to talk about how he scored twice and won the Cup for Swindon. That fame, that legend, was made possible only by Wembley. The 1948 Olympics were key to the Wembley story. The Games led to the construction of the modern Wembley Way with the flyover bridge; the modern tunnel, too, with the dressing rooms behind, were constructed for the Games. Before that, players emerged from a tunnel at roughly two o'clock from the 'new' one - and the original area is still used for vehicular access. Now the time's almost up. What will happen? Who knows, but I very much doubt if the new Wembley will last close to 80 years. If they manage to capture the spirit and ethos of the old place it may have a chance. It's misguided to think now of the old Wembley as the world's greatest ground. What it became, and remains, is the most famous stadium in the world. That's what the new Wembley, in all its hi-tech gloss and modernity, has to aspire to.",

      "body": "<p>In politics - and, as I have discovered in the past fortnight, in the publishing of books - timing is everything. I wanted Servants of the People to show how New Labour really works from the inside. Like any author, naturally I hoped there would be an appetite for a contemporary account, revealing and rounded, of the relationships at the top of the Government and how they entangle with the making of policy. I was not going to be disappointed if people described the book as incendiary. What I never quite anticipated was that it would light the fires it has since The Observer began serialising the book. Nor could I know - I confess this was simple luck - that it would be published just at the moment when New Labour suffered its spectacular plunge from grace.</p> <p>A question I've been repeatedly asked is: why? Why did so many people, at such senior levels, co-operate with the book? For one relatively straightforward reason, and another more complicated impulse. If an author is speaking to one party to an argument that has raged within Government, the other dimension wants its point of view reflected in the account as well, and the third angle doesn't want to be missed out either. Why were the sources so candid?</p> <p>It's probably true of all politicians, but it's especially true of New Labourites, that they tend to talk much more vividly and frankly in private than they do in public. It often struck me, as I conducted interviews, that if they could only translate some of their private emotion into their public performances, they might be more fondly regarded by the country. Indeed, a large part of the point of the book is to reveal the human face of New Labour beneath the suffocating mask of bland sound-biting. These are men and women consumed with high passions and tensions, loves and hates, fears and ambitions, which play out to both destructive and creative effect.</p> <p>Gathering information was often a simple case of knowing the right questions to put to the people who knew the answers. Journalism is a competitive, frequently cannibalistic profession. I've been both slightly surprised and greatly pleased that no serious commentator, of whatever political complexion, has challenged the veracity of my account. There was, as I anticipated, some ritual attempt at rebuttal from the Government about revelations that wounded them.</p> <p>So I offer one example of the care I took to be satisfied of the accuracy of what I was being told. It was from a member of the Cabinet that I first learnt that the Governor of the Bank of England had come so close to resignation that the Prime Minister had rung up Eddie George to bring him back from the brink. To hear this from a senior Minister in a position to know would be commonly regarded as sourcing enough for a newspaper story. For the book, I accumulated corroborating and amplifying testimony about the sequence of events from senior civil servants who were eye-witnesses and players in this episode.</p> <p>And once I had that, I secured conclusive confirmation of the story from the person absolutely best-placed to tell me that it was true that the Prime Minister had phoned the Governor.</p> <p>I believe there were profounder, some might even call them psychological, reasons for the depth and the candour with which people talked. The tiny and talented group, headed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, who created New Labour have never been as self-confident as they have sought to look. New Labour needs explaining to itself.</p> <p>This is a project in endless search of validation. One of the themes of the book is that the public swagger which has so often been labelled conceit and arrogance is actually the offspring of a deep insecurity about the nature of the project and its durability.</p> <p>In the early hours of 2 May, as the plane took him from Sedgefield to London to become Prime Minister, an apprehensive Tony Blair said to Cherie: 'But I've never been in government.' We tend to forget - and it is rather a tribute to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor that we neglect this - that none of the key players had ever been in government. The shock in Number 10 is not that they have tumbled in the opinion polls; the surprise is that it didn't happen much, much earlier.</p> <p>During the long, dream-like period of unprecedented popularity, Tony Blair and those around him were always anxiously awaiting the inevitable moment when the country would pinch them awake.</p> <p>After the multiple assault and battery on the Government, from the mounting debacles of the Millennium Dome to the fuel crisis, New Labour no longer looks to be in command of events. But the point is not that they have suddenly lost the magic touch. It is that those on the inside have never felt like magicians. The illusionists are best-placed to know what an illusion it was that New Labour was a glossily omnipotent machine always under the masterful control of an assured leader.</p> <p>That this illusion was maintained for so long was one of the great triumphs of Alastair Campbell's spin.</p> <p>There was a ready audience in a country that wanted its Government to be a success after the failures of the Major years. And successes, many of them, there have been. Newspaper headlines and serialisations inevitably provide only a flavour of a book. It is inevitable that they will concentrate on the warts, not the all. The Ecclestone Affair is probably the murkiest episode of New Labour's life, but it is only a chapter in the life of this Government, as it is only a chapter of the book. I thought - actually, I still think - that the revelation with the most broadly significant message about New Labour was that Tony Blair felt so wretched at his bleakest hour that he even despaired to one of his closest and most long-standing intimates: 'This is the end. They'll get me for this.'</p> <p>Was there ever a prospect that he would be forced to resign? No, I'd say none at all. That he feared that he might be ejected from office tells us how fragile New Labour felt its grip to be. Should Gordon Brown now resign? No. The Chancellor does not deserve to be turned into the fall-guy for Ecclestone - and, incidentally, my book doesn't make him so. I place chief responsibility for the affair with Number 10. Solidarity is not one of this Government's most conspicuous features.</p> <p>One of the striking things about the past week is how slowly his fellow Ministers rallied to the Chancellor when the pressure was at its peak. On Tuesday night, I found myself in the mildly surreal position of defending Gordon Brown on Newsnight, saying that if every politician in a panic who misled an interviewer was forced from office, we would not have many politicians left.</p> <p>I've been asking myself why this three-year-old affair blew up quite as incandescently as it did. After all, though I hoped to bring new detail to what happened, I thought it was already pretty well-established that New Labour was self-damagingly evasive about the affair. The answer, I suspect, is that much of the media and the Conservatives seized on an opportunity to revisit Ecclestone from a feeling that New Labour had got away too lightly at the time. The climate of goodwill towards the Government in its honeymoon period carried them through without all the awkward questions being properly asked at the time. Then they were taken on trust; now nothing is taken on trust.</p> <p>That honeymoon was the longest and most sustained for any British Government in history. Time after time, those in New Labour's high command have believed they were faced with meltdown. There were convulsing inner panics and recriminations when Peter Mandelson was defenestrated. The Kosovo conflict - during which Tony Blair performed with much greater courage than has hitherto been appreciated - might have cost him the premiership had it gone as horribly wrong as many in Downing Street feared it might. 'This is shit or bust', as he said.</p> <p>Yet he and the Government emerged from these crises not only intact, but often enhanced. For three years, the media wrote headline after headline describing New Labour's worst week and Blair's blackest day. For three years, the poll lead stretched on. And yet even this did not leave New Labour content. They fretted that the absence of a credible Opposition made things seem comfortable. The Government - this was the complaint among themselves - was not being given the credit due for its considerable achievements because of the absence of struggle.</p> <p>Incredible, but true, they worried that they were making government look too easy. So, this time last year, New Labour actually went out to make life more difficult for itself by conjuring up some enemies, the Forces of Conservatism which Tony Blair declared war upon in his Bournemouth conference speech.</p> <p>Twelve months on, you hear no-one inside New Labour worrying about a paucity of either struggles or enemies as the Government is besieged by aggrieved pensioners, petrol tax protesters and resurgent forces of conservatism. Conference revolt and Cabinet split - headlines which Tony Blair was supposed to have eradicated from association with Labour for eternity - shout from every newspaper. For the first time since Black Wednesday, the polls put the Tories ahead.</p> <p>The appearance of competence and responsiveness has been battered, and the reputation for disunity amplified by the alacrity with which Ministers have been scrambling to dump the blame for the Government's afflictions on each other.</p> <p>Given how hair-pulling they were being when New Labour was still way ahead in the polls, if Philip Gould is still writing memos about the focus groups to the Prime Minister, then they must make for very frightening reading.</p> <p>Tony Blair has turned into another unpopular Prime Minister. His mid-term has arrived later than usual; but come, as he always knew it would, it has. This is what history tells us happens to all governments, but for New Labour these are uncharted waters. A project that has so often believed success was synonymous with popularity is going to be fiercely tested if there is a period of sustained disaffection among the voters.</p> <p>There are many grounds for believing that the test can be passed. Beneath what the Prime Minister likes to call the passing frenzies, his Government can actually lay claim to some outstanding achievements, and displays fundamental strengths. The economy is healthy. Gordon Brown's war chest is almost embarrassingly bulging. The big tax and spend argument - so long as they are brave enough to make it - is there to be won against a stunt-addicted Conservative Party for whom opportunism always knocks. Investment in public services is growing while the tax burden remains one of the lowest in Europe. Few governments - perhaps no government - since the war have been so well-poised for re-election.</p> <p>It may even be that becoming unpopular had to happen to New Labour before it could realise its full potential as a government. Now, they will have to find a new tone of voice with which to talk to the country persuasively and firmly.</p> <p>They will have to summon up the courage to talk about their convictions. The Cabinet will have to become something more than a 45-minute coffee morning where the turbulent dual monarchy of Blair and Brown give other Ministers their message for the day. The party - this, at least, is the fervent hope inside Number 10 - will better appreciate its leaders' achievements now the Conservative threat is real.</p> <p>They will now pull together or be pulled to pieces. The resentments and rivalries that have too often disfigured relationships at the top of the Government are too bitterly entwined ever to be fully resolved. But the whole is bigger than the sum of the feuding parts.</p> <p>Tony Blair wants that second term, how he wants it. Gordon Brown wants to be his successor, how he wants it. Peter Mandelson wants to be Foreign Secretary, how he wants it. It may just be that this is the electric jolt they needed; the shock to the system that reminds them of the ambitions for themselves and for Britain that first made them allies and friends.</p> <p>New Labour's early narcotic period in power was deceiving about the Government. So too is the current climate of apocalypse. On May Day in 1997, Britain did not elect a communion of saints or a squad of supermen. In the autumn of 2000, we are not ruled by a pit of snakes or a bunch of idiots. They are flesh and blood. They have their heroic moments and their desperate ones. So New Labour suddenly looks mortal. Of course it does. It always was.</p>",

Like any author, naturally I hoped there would be an appetite for a contemporary account, revealing and rounded, of the relationships at the top of the Government and how they entangle with the making of policy. I was not going to be disappointed if people described the book as incendiary. What I never quite anticipated was that it would light the fires it has since The Observer began serialising the book. Nor could I know - I confess this was simple luck - that it would be published just at the moment when New Labour suffered its spectacular plunge from grace. A question I've been repeatedly asked is: why? Why did so many people, at such senior levels, co-operate with the book? For one relatively straightforward reason, and another more complicated impulse. If an author is speaking to one party to an argument that has raged within Government, the other dimension wants its point of view reflected in the account as well, and the third angle doesn't want to be missed out either. Why were the sources so candid? It's probably true of all politicians, but it's especially true of New Labourites, that they tend to talk much more vividly and frankly in private than they do in public. It often struck me, as I conducted interviews, that if they could only translate some of their private emotion into their public performances, they might be more fondly regarded by the country. Indeed, a large part of the point of the book is to reveal the human face of New Labour beneath the suffocating mask of bland sound-biting. These are men and women consumed with high passions and tensions, loves and hates, fears and ambitions, which play out to both destructive and creative effect. Gathering information was often a simple case of knowing the right questions to put to the people who knew the answers. Journalism is a competitive, frequently cannibalistic profession. I've been both slightly surprised and greatly pleased that no serious commentator, of whatever political complexion, has challenged the veracity of my account. There was, as I anticipated, some ritual attempt at rebuttal from the Government about revelations that wounded them. So I offer one example of the care I took to be satisfied of the accuracy of what I was being told. It was from a member of the Cabinet that I first learnt that the Governor of the Bank of England had come so close to resignation that the Prime Minister had rung up Eddie George to bring him back from the brink. To hear this from a senior Minister in a position to know would be commonly regarded as sourcing enough for a newspaper story. For the book, I accumulated corroborating and amplifying testimony about the sequence of events from senior civil servants who were eye-witnesses and players in this episode. And once I had that, I secured conclusive confirmation of the story from the person absolutely best-placed to tell me that it was true that the Prime Minister had phoned the Governor. I believe there were profounder, some might even call them psychological, reasons for the depth and the candour with which people talked. The tiny and talented group, headed by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, who created New Labour have never been as self-confident as they have sought to look. New Labour needs explaining to itself. This is a project in endless search of validation. One of the themes of the book is that the public swagger which has so often been labelled conceit and arrogance is actually the offspring of a deep insecurity about the nature of the project and its durability. In the early hours of 2 May, as the plane took him from Sedgefield to London to become Prime Minister, an apprehensive Tony Blair said to Cherie: 'But I've never been in government.' We tend to forget - and it is rather a tribute to the Prime Minister and the Chancellor that we neglect this - that none of the key players had ever been in government. The shock in Number 10 is not that they have tumbled in the opinion polls; the surprise is that it didn't happen much, much earlier. During the long, dream-like period of unprecedented popularity, Tony Blair and those around him were always anxiously awaiting the inevitable moment when the country would pinch them awake. After the multiple assault and battery on the Government, from the mounting debacles of the Millennium Dome to the fuel crisis, New Labour no longer looks to be in command of events. But the point is not that they have suddenly lost the magic touch. It is that those on the inside have never felt like magicians. The illusionists are best-placed to know what an illusion it was that New Labour was a glossily omnipotent machine always under the masterful control of an assured leader. That this illusion was maintained for so long was one of the great triumphs of Alastair Campbell's spin. There was a ready audience in a country that wanted its Government to be a success after the failures of the Major years. And successes, many of them, there have been. Newspaper headlines and serialisations inevitably provide only a flavour of a book. It is inevitable that they will concentrate on the warts, not the all. The Ecclestone Affair is probably the murkiest episode of New Labour's life, but it is only a chapter in the life of this Government, as it is only a chapter of the book. I thought - actually, I still think - that the revelation with the most broadly significant message about New Labour was that Tony Blair felt so wretched at his bleakest hour that he even despaired to one of his closest and most long-standing intimates: 'This is the end. They'll get me for this.' Was there ever a prospect that he would be forced to resign? No, I'd say none at all. That he feared that he might be ejected from office tells us how fragile New Labour felt its grip to be. Should Gordon Brown now resign? No. The Chancellor does not deserve to be turned into the fall-guy for Ecclestone - and, incidentally, my book doesn't make him so. I place chief responsibility for the affair with Number 10. Solidarity is not one of this Government's most conspicuous features. One of the striking things about the past week is how slowly his fellow Ministers rallied to the Chancellor when the pressure was at its peak. On Tuesday night, I found myself in the mildly surreal position of defending Gordon Brown on Newsnight, saying that if every politician in a panic who misled an interviewer was forced from office, we would not have many politicians left. I've been asking myself why this three-year-old affair blew up quite as incandescently as it did. After all, though I hoped to bring new detail to what happened, I thought it was already pretty well-established that New Labour was self-damagingly evasive about the affair. The answer, I suspect, is that much of the media and the Conservatives seized on an opportunity to revisit Ecclestone from a feeling that New Labour had got away too lightly at the time. The climate of goodwill towards the Government in its honeymoon period carried them through without all the awkward questions being properly asked at the time. Then they were taken on trust; now nothing is taken on trust. That honeymoon was the longest and most sustained for any British Government in history. Time after time, those in New Labour's high command have believed they were faced with meltdown. There were convulsing inner panics and recriminations when Peter Mandelson was defenestrated. The Kosovo conflict - during which Tony Blair performed with much greater courage than has hitherto been appreciated - might have cost him the premiership had it gone as horribly wrong as many in Downing Street feared it might. 'This is shit or bust', as he said. Yet he and the Government emerged from these crises not only intact, but often enhanced. For three years, the media wrote headline after headline describing New Labour's worst week and Blair's blackest day. For three years, the poll lead stretched on. And yet even this did not leave New Labour content. They fretted that the absence of a credible Opposition made things seem comfortable. The Government - this was the complaint among themselves - was not being given the credit due for its considerable achievements because of the absence of struggle. Incredible, but true, they worried that they were making government look too easy. So, this time last year, New Labour actually went out to make life more difficult for itself by conjuring up some enemies, the Forces of Conservatism which Tony Blair declared war upon in his Bournemouth conference speech. Twelve months on, you hear no-one inside New Labour worrying about a paucity of either struggles or enemies as the Government is besieged by aggrieved pensioners, petrol tax protesters and resurgent forces of conservatism. Conference revolt and Cabinet split - headlines which Tony Blair was supposed to have eradicated from association with Labour for eternity - shout from every newspaper. For the first time since Black Wednesday, the polls put the Tories ahead. The appearance of competence and responsiveness has been battered, and the reputation for disunity amplified by the alacrity with which Ministers have been scrambling to dump the blame for the Government's afflictions on each other. Given how hair-pulling they were being when New Labour was still way ahead in the polls, if Philip Gould is still writing memos about the focus groups to the Prime Minister, then they must make for very frightening reading. Tony Blair has turned into another unpopular Prime Minister. His mid-term has arrived later than usual; but come, as he always knew it would, it has. This is what history tells us happens to all governments, but for New Labour these are uncharted waters. A project that has so often believed success was synonymous with popularity is going to be fiercely tested if there is a period of sustained disaffection among the voters. There are many grounds for believing that the test can be passed. Beneath what the Prime Minister likes to call the passing frenzies, his Government can actually lay claim to some outstanding achievements, and displays fundamental strengths. The economy is healthy. Gordon Brown's war chest is almost embarrassingly bulging. The big tax and spend argument - so long as they are brave enough to make it - is there to be won against a stunt-addicted Conservative Party for whom opportunism always knocks. Investment in public services is growing while the tax burden remains one of the lowest in Europe. Few governments - perhaps no government - since the war have been so well-poised for re-election. It may even be that becoming unpopular had to happen to New Labour before it could realise its full potential as a government. Now, they will have to find a new tone of voice with which to talk to the country persuasively and firmly. They will have to summon up the courage to talk about their convictions. The Cabinet will have to become something more than a 45-minute coffee morning where the turbulent dual monarchy of Blair and Brown give other Ministers their message for the day. The party - this, at least, is the fervent hope inside Number 10 - will better appreciate its leaders' achievements now the Conservative threat is real. They will now pull together or be pulled to pieces. The resentments and rivalries that have too often disfigured relationships at the top of the Government are too bitterly entwined ever to be fully resolved. But the whole is bigger than the sum of the feuding parts. Tony Blair wants that second term, how he wants it. Gordon Brown wants to be his successor, how he wants it. Peter Mandelson wants to be Foreign Secretary, how he wants it. It may just be that this is the electric jolt they needed; the shock to the system that reminds them of the ambitions for themselves and for Britain that first made them allies and friends. New Labour's early narcotic period in power was deceiving about the Government. So too is the current climate of apocalypse. On May Day in 1997, Britain did not elect a communion of saints or a squad of supermen. In the autumn of 2000, we are not ruled by a pit of snakes or a bunch of idiots. They are flesh and blood. They have their heroic moments and their desperate ones. So New Labour suddenly looks mortal. Of course it does. It always was.",

      "body": "<p>Evreyone has favourite Wembley memories. Especially the great goals - and the television age has preserved the bulk of post-war efforts on film or videotape. Few can match Ricky Villa's 1981 FA Cup winning effort for Tottenham against Manchester City in terms of sheer skill and audacity. But none can match <strong>Geoff Hurst's</strong> 1966 World Cup final hat-trick for drama and controversy. </p> <p>His second goal, England's third, will be talked about forever. Into extra time at 2-2, Alan Ball crosses from the right, Hurst swivels and shoots - in off the crossbar. But was it over the line? 'I believe very strongly it was in,' said Hurst - now Sir Geoffrey and ready to welcome the Germans back for the stadium's 7 October finale in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. </p> <p>'Roger Hunt wheeled away shouting \"Goal!\" when his striker's instinct would have been to make sure if he thought it hadn't gone in. That's good enough for me. For the umpteenth, thousandth time, it was over the line. If you don't believe me just look in the record books.' </p> <p>Then there was the sheer power and drama of his third, putting the issue beyond all doubt. The net bulged before the German keeper Hans Tilkowski moved a muscle. </p> <p>'We'd played two hours at Wembley in difficult conditions on a heavy pitch in a very hard game,' Hurst said. 'When the ball came to me in the final seconds, I was just going to hit it as hard as I could. If it went behind the goal 50 or 60 yards it would have taken a vital few seconds for it to be retrieved and the game would probably have been over. After it went in, I hardly remember what happened next. Someone said, 'well done,' but that's it.' </p> <p>Hurst and Villa were scorers of great goals, but there were also outstanding feats at the other end. <strong>Bert Trautmann's</strong> bravery in completing the 1956 FA Cup Final for victorious Manchester City against Birmingham with a broken neck is the stuff of legend but it can't compete with the split-second, gravity-defying brilliance of <strong>Jim Montgomery's</strong> fabulous double-save that helped to inspire Sunderland to their 1973 triumph over mighty Leeds. </p> <p>Sunderland, stoically defending the lead given them by Ian Porterfield's 31st-minute goal, were unhinged by Paul Reaney's deep cross from the right. Trevor Cherry popped up unmarked at the far post to power a diving header to Montgomery's left. He dived low and parried but the ball ran straight to Peter Lorimer with the goalkeeper sprawled on the turf. Lorimer shot firmly at the unguarded net only for 'Monty' to spring from the turf, hauling himself left to fist the ball against the crossbar and to safety. </p> <p>'Immediately after the game I thought I maybe should have held the first one,' says Montgomery - now Darlington's assistant manager - in a moment of brutal self-criticism. 'But when I looked at the tape and looked at the context of the save, I wasn't too hard on myself. I'm grateful that I produced a save like that when it mattered. So many players and teams freeze on the big occasion. I didn't - we didn't - and we did enough to win what was a great game.' </p> <p>It was Montgomery's only big game at the great ground although many good judges believe he should have played for England there. What made Wembley special for him? </p> <p>'It's the crowd that makes Wembley different from the Old Traffords and Anfields,' he said. 'As you come up out of the tunnel the noise is phenomenal, like a blanket. Then when you get out on the pitch, you're so remote from the fans, you can't hear them. It's amazing. </p> <p>'From a fan's point of view, the facilities are abysmal. But Wembley was special and I'll miss those towers. Apart from my save, the thing that sticks in my mind most about Cup Final day was driving up Wembley Way through a sea of red and white and seeing those fantastic towers. It's shameful that they have not been incorporated into the new ground.' </p> <p>Another save is remembered more for the failure of the striker than the importance of the block. Ten year's after Montgomery's heroics, <strong>Gordon Smith</strong> had the chance to win the Cup for Brighton against Manchester United. Again the TV commentary has eased the moment into folklore. 'And Smith must score' said John Motson as the ball went from Michael Robinson to striker Smith's feet 12 yards out in the last moments of normal time. </p> <p>Smith, now a Fifa-accredited agent in Scotland, recalls: 'I just remember Michael bursting through, and I moved up to support him. He rolled the ball to me and I took one touch before hitting a low shot. I am certainly not blaming Michael, but if he had knocked the ball to me with a bit more pace I would probably have struck it first time. As it was I took the touch, then sent United goalkeeper Gary Bailey the wrong way, only to see the ball stick between his legs and stay there. I moved in hoping to seize on any rebound, but the ball just didn't come back out to me. </p> <p>'Yes, I believe \"Smith should have scored\" but it was nevertheless a tremendous save by Gary, and I know he was always a bit annoyed that he didn't receive the credit he felt he deserved.' </p> <p>The final ended 2-2 after extra time, with United winning the replay 4-0. </p> <p>England suffered some of their darkest moments at Wembley. Hungary, inspired by <strong>Ferenc Puskas</strong>, humbled England 6-3 in 1953, becoming the first non-British national team to win at the national stadium. Another memorable failure for England came 20 years later, when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Poland and failed to qualify for the 1974 World Cup finals. The match - and the Polish goal - was a nightmare for the Leeds defender <strong>Norman Hunter</strong>. </p> <p>For Hunter, 17 October, 1973 was a golden opportunity. England manager Sir Alf Ramsey had 'rested' his skipper, Bobby Moore, after an unconvincing defensive display in defeat against Poland in Chorzow. Hunter was in for the return - playing in his favoured centre-back role in a truly big international match for the first time. </p> <p>Everyone now knows that Poland's goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski was inspired - and Jan Domarski got the goal that put England out of the competition. What some may forget - but not Hunter, never Hunter - was that he 'screwed it' in the break that led to the goal. England's failure to qualify led directly to Ramsey's sacking and meant the end of Hunter's hopes of making the World Cup finals as a first-choice England pick. </p> <p>'Poland's goal was my fault,' he says. Only when he recounts the painful detail does he hesitate. 'It was me against Grezegorz Lato and what I was going to do... I'd set myself to tackle with my left foot. I was going to take him and the ball out. Instead I changed my mind and thought I'd keep it in - thought I'd lift the ball with my right foot...' </p> <p>In that moment, Hunter was lost. Lato pounced and streaked away down England's right flank. Still, when the ball was played for Lato, a goal was far from certain. 'Yes, Peter Shilton should have thrown his cap on it,' says Hunter ruefully. 'Lato's shot wasn't brilliant but it went under him. He should have really saved it, but... it was my fault. I've never played in a more one-sided game and lost. </p> <p>'But I've good memories too. I recall playing in an England Probables v Possibles training game as a 22-year-old before the '66 finals. For a young player, that was quite something. I loved it. You can keep the Nou Camp and Bernabeu and all that - Wembley was the place. I'll miss it.' </p> <p>The following year, 1974, Hunter watched as a sell-out crowd was astonished by the double sending-off of his team-mate Billy Bremner and Liverpool's Kevin Keegan in the first Charity Shield game to be played at Wembley. The pair came to blows after Keegan was hit by a bad tackle near Leeds' penalty box. After referee Bob Mathewson sent them off, they petulantly tore off their shirts as they ran towards the tunnel. Hunter recalls with a chuckle: 'It was out of character for them both but Kevin got the wrong man when he turned on Billy - he was tackled by Johnny Giles!' </p> <p>From an earlier era, <strong>Tony Pawson</strong> - an Observer contributor for 50 years and a great amateur sportsman in the Corinthian tradition - recalls the glory of Wembley FA Amateur Cup wins with Pegasus. </p> <p>'Some 50 years ago my ambitions were playing before full houses at Lord's and Wembley. Despite its shorter history, Wembley was the more atmospheric venue. To drive up Wembley Way was more inspirational than walking through the Grace Gates. </p> <p>'The joy of twice mounting the steps to receive the Amateur Cup remains a dream fully realised. There will be no more Wembley dreams, only memories. Happily for me the dreams remain joyous memories.' </p> <p>Not that it's all football...</p> <p><strong>RUGBY LEAGUE</strong> </p> <p> In all the 73 Rugby League matches to have played at Wembley since 1929 - nine internationals and 64 Challenge Cup finals - the most enduring memory is of a missed goal kick. </p> <p>It came in 1968, in a sodden final between Wakefield Trinity and Leeds. Ken Hirst, the Wakefield wing, had splashed through the puddles to score a last-minute try which cut his team's deficit to 11-10, leaving <strong>Don Fox</strong>, Trinity's loose forward who had already won the Lance Todd Trophy as man of the match, with the apparent formality of converting from under the posts. </p> <p>But Fox toe-poked the ball wide, and immediately slumped to his knees in despair, immersing his head in a puddle. 'He's a poor lad,' said the BBC commentator Eddie Waring. Fox never played again, subsequently retiring from his job as a joiner for the National Coal Board at Sharlston because of ill health. He has never spoken about the incident which ended his career but Peter, his older brother and the former Bradford, Featherstone and Great Britain coach, is keen to set the record straight. </p> <p>'First of all, it was only the foresight of our Don in taking a short kick-off to Hirst which set up the try,' says Fox. 'And although everyone else thought Wakefield had won the cup, I was worried because I could see our Don trying to wipe the ball on his jersey. But there wasn't a dry spot in the house. If I could, I'd have gone on that field and let him wipe the ball on my shirt. </p> <p>'He was devastated. Not for missing the goal - as he said, everybody misses the odd kick from under the posts. But not everybody has lost a gold medal for their team-mates. That's a measure of our Don. Only a great man would think of their mates in that predicament.' </p> <p>Don Fox still lives in Featherstone - no doubt with, at best, mixed emotions and memories of Wembley. </p> <p><strong>RUGBY UNION</strong> </p> <p> Union's links with Wembley are far more limited than League's - yet one of the British game's most momentous matches took place beneath the twin towers. For a change, the 'home' side were Wales and the vanquished visitors England. </p> <p>It was 11 April, 1999 when Wales ended their popular, but temporary, tenancy at Wembley during the construction of The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. On a sunny Sunday afternoon, Grand-Slam-chasing England took on Wales in the last Five Nations match of the season and - with Italy due to join the competition in 2000 - the last in its history. </p> <p>Despite racing to an early try-scoring lead, England could not escape the range of Neil Jenkins's boot and were only six points ahead as the game went into injury time. Wales won a line-out on the English 22 and Rob Howley fed Scott Quinnell on a set move. Quinnell juggled the ball, which threw the English defence, and sent <strong>Scott Gibbs</strong> on a dancing rampage through the resultant gap, past four defenders and over the try-line. Jenkins's conversion gave Wales the most famous of victories. </p> <p>'I also played there in the 1996 Rugby League Challenge Cup,' says Gibbs, 'which was an incredible experience. It's the most famous football ground in the world. But to beat England there in the last minute, with us as the underdogs against the Grand Slam contenders: I wish it could always be like that. Before the game, the English management were asking which way up the steps the England team should go after the game. The ribbons were on the Five Nations trophy.' </p> <p>Howley, Wales's captain for the day, remembers it with equal fondness: 'It's just unbelievable to think that all those players have changed in the same changing rooms... and when we walked out, the atmosphere was electric.' </p> <p> <strong> THE OLYMPICS</strong> </p> <p>The Games came to Wembley in 1948 when London was the host city. When Dutch sprinter <strong> Fanny Blankers-Koen</strong> arrived her first impression was: 'Well it looked all right. We didn't think too much of it, really. I never expected to achieve anything big there.' </p> <p>The 30-year-old mother of two was not alone in considering herself an outsider. 'The British team manager Jack Crump had written me off in a magazine article, said I was too old,' says Blankers-Koen, now 82. 'It didn't bother me. I thought that he might be right!' she laughs. But he could not have been more wrong. </p> <p>She won the 100m by a distance and followed up in the 80m hurdles, the 200m and the 4x100m relay- still the only female athlete to have won four gold medals at one Games. She recently travelled to Monte Carlo to receive the Female Athlete of the Century award. 'I'd never expected them to choose an old git like me', she says. </p> <p><strong>BOXING</strong> </p> <p> The final round of the fight at Wembley Stadium in September 1995 was one of the most memorable in modern boxing history. In the ring in the middle of the turf were <strong>Frank Bruno</strong> and the American, Oliver McCall, and with one round left Bruno was three minutes away from winning the world heavyweight title. He was exhausted, though, and the crowd of 30,000 was standing, willing the British man to victory. </p> <p>Bruno had been at Wembley before - in 1986 - when he failed to take the world title from Tim Witherspoon. There had been no boxing on the pitch at Wembley for 23 years before then. The previous fight was the 1963 non-title meeting between Henry Cooper and the then Cassius Clay in which Cooper connected with a left hook that dropped Clay. Sadly, Our 'Enery was cut and the fight was stopped, yet Cooper's solitary success has remained a talking point. </p> <p>But the mood of the fans in the stadium when Bruno was raised from his stool at the start of round 12 and sent to successfully survive the final three minutes is the ultimate Wembley boxing moment. For everybody knew that Bruno was just one punch from defeat. </p> <p><strong>SPEEDWAY</strong> </p> <p> Wembley became a big stage for speedway - much to the irritation of Walter Winterbottom, England's first football manager. He said 'that motorbike stuff' damaged the flanks of the pitch. But it is fondly recalled by one great champion,<strong>Ole Olsen</strong>. He won two world titles at Wembley - in 1975 and again three years later - when he triumphed before 93,000 fans at the Golden Jubilee world championship. </p> <p>'I loved Wembley,' says Olsen who heads the Speedway Grand Prix Association in his native Copenhagen. 'It was extremely narrow coming out of the corners so you had to hit the right spot. What I remember best is coming out of that tunnel - a tremendous feeling when there were a lot of people there. And there usually were.' </p> <p>But it was different when, aged 24, Olsen made his first visit to Wembley for the 1971 European Championship. </p> <p>'My bike broke and I ended up on the ground. I was very upset and some bastard came to me and said it didn't matter because it was more important to win at the World Championships. I did win at the Worlds - but I just wanted to win at Wembley.' </p> <p><strong>GREYHOUNDS</strong> </p> <p> Many of the outstanding dogs in the history of greyhound racing were trained and raced at Wembley but undoubtedly the sport's greatest moment at the stadium was the legendary <strong>Mick The Miller's</strong> triumph in the 1931 St Leger. </p> <p>Mick the Miller, winner of the Greyhound Derby over 525 yards at the White City in both 1929 and 1930 was prevented from claiming an amazing hat-trick in that classic the following year when he was first past post in the final, only for the race to be declared void. He could finish only fourth in the re-run. By 1931 he was five years old and clearly past his best and it was thought he would be retired when beaten in several subsequent races. </p> <p>But it was decided to give him one last classic outing in the Leger over 700 yards, a longer distance than he had ever attempted. Mick the Miller ran unbeaten throughout the event, winning by a length in the final to the thunderous cheers of a packed stadium - big race events often attracted close to 100,000 - and it was the great dog's last race. </p> <p><strong>THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE ON THE PITCH...</strong></p> <p> Seconds before Hurst shot his third goal in 1966, the BBC commentator Ken Wolstenholme memorably observed: 'Some people are on the pitch... they think it's all over...' </p> <p>One of those pitch invaders was<strong>Michael Richardson</strong>, a Londoner who was 17 at the time and a drummer with a rock group. 'I had a seat near the front opposite the Royal Box and I clambered on to the pitch. It was sheer elation. I wasn't a hooligan or anything. I didn't get very far, no farther than the touchline before I was dragged off by six policemen. I wasn't thrown out - they just dropped me back in the crowd. There was a real carnival atmosphere.' That night he played at Tiffany's in central London. 'Everybody was buzzing. Great days.' </p> <p>Richardson, still drumming, for singer Elkie Brooks, is not impressed with what they're doing to the old stadium. 'Nostalgia isn't what it used to be,' he says gloomily. And if he thinks it's all over for the stage where he briefly achieved fame... it is now. </p> <p><em>Reports by Bill Bradshaw, Peter White, Andy Wilson, Michael Aylwin, Marie-Jose Kleef, Oliver Owen, Ruud Hunt, Steve Bunce, Jon Henderson </em></p>",

Into extra time at 2-2, Alan Ball crosses from the right, Hurst swivels and shoots - in off the crossbar. But was it over the line? 'I believe very strongly it was in,' said Hurst - now Sir Geoffrey and ready to welcome the Germans back for the stadium's 7 October finale in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. 'Roger Hunt wheeled away shouting \"Goal!\" when his striker's instinct would have been to make sure if he thought it hadn't gone in. That's good enough for me. For the umpteenth, thousandth time, it was over the line. If you don't believe me just look in the record books.' Then there was the sheer power and drama of his third, putting the issue beyond all doubt. The net bulged before the German keeper Hans Tilkowski moved a muscle. 'We'd played two hours at Wembley in difficult conditions on a heavy pitch in a very hard game,' Hurst said. 'When the ball came to me in the final seconds, I was just going to hit it as hard as I could. If it went behind the goal 50 or 60 yards it would have taken a vital few seconds for it to be retrieved and the game would probably have been over. After it went in, I hardly remember what happened next. Someone said, 'well done,' but that's it.' Hurst and Villa were scorers of great goals, but there were also outstanding feats at the other end. Bert Trautmann's bravery in completing the 1956 FA Cup Final for victorious Manchester City against Birmingham with a broken neck is the stuff of legend but it can't compete with the split-second, gravity-defying brilliance of Jim Montgomery's fabulous double-save that helped to inspire Sunderland to their 1973 triumph over mighty Leeds. Sunderland, stoically defending the lead given them by Ian Porterfield's 31st-minute goal, were unhinged by Paul Reaney's deep cross from the right. Trevor Cherry popped up unmarked at the far post to power a diving header to Montgomery's left. He dived low and parried but the ball ran straight to Peter Lorimer with the goalkeeper sprawled on the turf. Lorimer shot firmly at the unguarded net only for 'Monty' to spring from the turf, hauling himself left to fist the ball against the crossbar and to safety. 'Immediately after the game I thought I maybe should have held the first one,' says Montgomery - now Darlington's assistant manager - in a moment of brutal self-criticism. 'But when I looked at the tape and looked at the context of the save, I wasn't too hard on myself. I'm grateful that I produced a save like that when it mattered. So many players and teams freeze on the big occasion. I didn't - we didn't - and we did enough to win what was a great game.' It was Montgomery's only big game at the great ground although many good judges believe he should have played for England there. What made Wembley special for him? 'It's the crowd that makes Wembley different from the Old Traffords and Anfields,' he said. 'As you come up out of the tunnel the noise is phenomenal, like a blanket. Then when you get out on the pitch, you're so remote from the fans, you can't hear them. It's amazing. 'From a fan's point of view, the facilities are abysmal. But Wembley was special and I'll miss those towers. Apart from my save, the thing that sticks in my mind most about Cup Final day was driving up Wembley Way through a sea of red and white and seeing those fantastic towers. It's shameful that they have not been incorporated into the new ground.' Another save is remembered more for the failure of the striker than the importance of the block. Ten year's after Montgomery's heroics, Gordon Smith had the chance to win the Cup for Brighton against Manchester United. Again the TV commentary has eased the moment into folklore. 'And Smith must score' said John Motson as the ball went from Michael Robinson to striker Smith's feet 12 yards out in the last moments of normal time. Smith, now a Fifa-accredited agent in Scotland, recalls: 'I just remember Michael bursting through, and I moved up to support him. He rolled the ball to me and I took one touch before hitting a low shot. I am certainly not blaming Michael, but if he had knocked the ball to me with a bit more pace I would probably have struck it first time. As it was I took the touch, then sent United goalkeeper Gary Bailey the wrong way, only to see the ball stick between his legs and stay there. I moved in hoping to seize on any rebound, but the ball just didn't come back out to me. 'Yes, I believe \"Smith should have scored\" but it was nevertheless a tremendous save by Gary, and I know he was always a bit annoyed that he didn't receive the credit he felt he deserved.' The final ended 2-2 after extra time, with United winning the replay 4-0. England suffered some of their darkest moments at Wembley. Hungary, inspired by Ferenc Puskas, humbled England 6-3 in 1953, becoming the first non-British national team to win at the national stadium. Another memorable failure for England came 20 years later, when they were held to a 1-1 draw by Poland and failed to qualify for the 1974 World Cup finals. The match - and the Polish goal - was a nightmare for the Leeds defender Norman Hunter. For Hunter, 17 October, 1973 was a golden opportunity. England manager Sir Alf Ramsey had 'rested' his skipper, Bobby Moore, after an unconvincing defensive display in defeat against Poland in Chorzow. Hunter was in for the return - playing in his favoured centre-back role in a truly big international match for the first time. Everyone now knows that Poland's goalkeeper Jan Tomaszewski was inspired - and Jan Domarski got the goal that put England out of the competition. What some may forget - but not Hunter, never Hunter - was that he 'screwed it' in the break that led to the goal. England's failure to qualify led directly to Ramsey's sacking and meant the end of Hunter's hopes of making the World Cup finals as a first-choice England pick. 'Poland's goal was my fault,' he says. Only when he recounts the painful detail does he hesitate. 'It was me against Grezegorz Lato and what I was going to do... I'd set myself to tackle with my left foot. I was going to take him and the ball out. Instead I changed my mind and thought I'd keep it in - thought I'd lift the ball with my right foot...' In that moment, Hunter was lost. Lato pounced and streaked away down England's right flank. Still, when the ball was played for Lato, a goal was far from certain. 'Yes, Peter Shilton should have thrown his cap on it,' says Hunter ruefully. 'Lato's shot wasn't brilliant but it went under him. He should have really saved it, but... it was my fault. I've never played in a more one-sided game and lost. 'But I've good memories too. I recall playing in an England Probables v Possibles training game as a 22-year-old before the '66 finals. For a young player, that was quite something. I loved it. You can keep the Nou Camp and Bernabeu and all that - Wembley was the place. I'll miss it.' The following year, 1974, Hunter watched as a sell-out crowd was astonished by the double sending-off of his team-mate Billy Bremner and Liverpool's Kevin Keegan in the first Charity Shield game to be played at Wembley. The pair came to blows after Keegan was hit by a bad tackle near Leeds' penalty box. After referee Bob Mathewson sent them off, they petulantly tore off their shirts as they ran towards the tunnel. Hunter recalls with a chuckle: 'It was out of character for them both but Kevin got the wrong man when he turned on Billy - he was tackled by Johnny Giles!' From an earlier era, Tony Pawson - an Observer contributor for 50 years and a great amateur sportsman in the Corinthian tradition - recalls the glory of Wembley FA Amateur Cup wins with Pegasus. 'Some 50 years ago my ambitions were playing before full houses at Lord's and Wembley. Despite its shorter history, Wembley was the more atmospheric venue. To drive up Wembley Way was more inspirational than walking through the Grace Gates. 'The joy of twice mounting the steps to receive the Amateur Cup remains a dream fully realised. There will be no more Wembley dreams, only memories. Happily for me the dreams remain joyous memories.' Not that it's all football... RUGBY LEAGUE In all the 73 Rugby League matches to have played at Wembley since 1929 - nine internationals and 64 Challenge Cup finals - the most enduring memory is of a missed goal kick. It came in 1968, in a sodden final between Wakefield Trinity and Leeds. Ken Hirst, the Wakefield wing, had splashed through the puddles to score a last-minute try which cut his team's deficit to 11-10, leaving Don Fox, Trinity's loose forward who had already won the Lance Todd Trophy as man of the match, with the apparent formality of converting from under the posts. But Fox toe-poked the ball wide, and immediately slumped to his knees in despair, immersing his head in a puddle. 'He's a poor lad,' said the BBC commentator Eddie Waring. Fox never played again, subsequently retiring from his job as a joiner for the National Coal Board at Sharlston because of ill health. He has never spoken about the incident which ended his career but Peter, his older brother and the former Bradford, Featherstone and Great Britain coach, is keen to set the record straight. 'First of all, it was only the foresight of our Don in taking a short kick-off to Hirst which set up the try,' says Fox. 'And although everyone else thought Wakefield had won the cup, I was worried because I could see our Don trying to wipe the ball on his jersey. But there wasn't a dry spot in the house. If I could, I'd have gone on that field and let him wipe the ball on my shirt. 'He was devastated. Not for missing the goal - as he said, everybody misses the odd kick from under the posts. But not everybody has lost a gold medal for their team-mates. That's a measure of our Don. Only a great man would think of their mates in that predicament.' Don Fox still lives in Featherstone - no doubt with, at best, mixed emotions and memories of Wembley. RUGBY UNION Union's links with Wembley are far more limited than League's - yet one of the British game's most momentous matches took place beneath the twin towers. For a change, the 'home' side were Wales and the vanquished visitors England. It was 11 April, 1999 when Wales ended their popular, but temporary, tenancy at Wembley during the construction of The Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. On a sunny Sunday afternoon, Grand-Slam-chasing England took on Wales in the last Five Nations match of the season and - with Italy due to join the competition in 2000 - the last in its history. Despite racing to an early try-scoring lead, England could not escape the range of Neil Jenkins's boot and were only six points ahead as the game went into injury time. Wales won a line-out on the English 22 and Rob Howley fed Scott Quinnell on a set move. Quinnell juggled the ball, which threw the English defence, and sent Scott Gibbs on a dancing rampage through the resultant gap, past four defenders and over the try-line. Jenkins's conversion gave Wales the most famous of victories. 'I also played there in the 1996 Rugby League Challenge Cup,' says Gibbs, 'which was an incredible experience. It's the most famous football ground in the world. But to beat England there in the last minute, with us as the underdogs against the Grand Slam contenders: I wish it could always be like that. Before the game, the English management were asking which way up the steps the England team should go after the game. The ribbons were on the Five Nations trophy.' Howley, Wales's captain for the day, remembers it with equal fondness: 'It's just unbelievable to think that all those players have changed in the same changing rooms... and when we walked out, the atmosphere was electric.' THE OLYMPICS The Games came to Wembley in 1948 when London was the host city. When Dutch sprinter Fanny Blankers-Koen arrived her first impression was: 'Well it looked all right. We didn't think too much of it, really. I never expected to achieve anything big there.' The 30-year-old mother of two was not alone in considering herself an outsider. 'The British team manager Jack Crump had written me off in a magazine article, said I was too old,' says Blankers-Koen, now 82. 'It didn't bother me. I thought that he might be right!' she laughs. But he could not have been more wrong. She won the 100m by a distance and followed up in the 80m hurdles, the 200m and the 4x100m relay- still the only female athlete to have won four gold medals at one Games. She recently travelled to Monte Carlo to receive the Female Athlete of the Century award. 'I'd never expected them to choose an old git like me', she says. BOXING The final round of the fight at Wembley Stadium in September 1995 was one of the most memorable in modern boxing history. In the ring in the middle of the turf were Frank Bruno and the American, Oliver McCall, and with one round left Bruno was three minutes away from winning the world heavyweight title. He was exhausted, though, and the crowd of 30,000 was standing, willing the British man to victory. Bruno had been at Wembley before - in 1986 - when he failed to take the world title from Tim Witherspoon. There had been no boxing on the pitch at Wembley for 23 years before then. The previous fight was the 1963 non-title meeting between Henry Cooper and the then Cassius Clay in which Cooper connected with a left hook that dropped Clay. Sadly, Our 'Enery was cut and the fight was stopped, yet Cooper's solitary success has remained a talking point. But the mood of the fans in the stadium when Bruno was raised from his stool at the start of round 12 and sent to successfully survive the final three minutes is the ultimate Wembley boxing moment. For everybody knew that Bruno was just one punch from defeat. SPEEDWAY Wembley became a big stage for speedway - much to the irritation of Walter Winterbottom, England's first football manager. He said 'that motorbike stuff' damaged the flanks of the pitch. But it is fondly recalled by one great champion,Ole Olsen. He won two world titles at Wembley - in 1975 and again three years later - when he triumphed before 93,000 fans at the Golden Jubilee world championship. 'I loved Wembley,' says Olsen who heads the Speedway Grand Prix Association in his native Copenhagen. 'It was extremely narrow coming out of the corners so you had to hit the right spot. What I remember best is coming out of that tunnel - a tremendous feeling when there were a lot of people there. And there usually were.' But it was different when, aged 24, Olsen made his first visit to Wembley for the 1971 European Championship. 'My bike broke and I ended up on the ground. I was very upset and some bastard came to me and said it didn't matter because it was more important to win at the World Championships. I did win at the Worlds - but I just wanted to win at Wembley.' GREYHOUNDS Many of the outstanding dogs in the history of greyhound racing were trained and raced at Wembley but undoubtedly the sport's greatest moment at the stadium was the legendary Mick The Miller's triumph in the 1931 St Leger. Mick the Miller, winner of the Greyhound Derby over 525 yards at the White City in both 1929 and 1930 was prevented from claiming an amazing hat-trick in that classic the following year when he was first past post in the final, only for the race to be declared void. He could finish only fourth in the re-run. By 1931 he was five years old and clearly past his best and it was thought he would be retired when beaten in several subsequent races. But it was decided to give him one last classic outing in the Leger over 700 yards, a longer distance than he had ever attempted. Mick the Miller ran unbeaten throughout the event, winning by a length in the final to the thunderous cheers of a packed stadium - big race events often attracted close to 100,000 - and it was the great dog's last race. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE ON THE PITCH... Seconds before Hurst shot his third goal in 1966, the BBC commentator Ken Wolstenholme memorably observed: 'Some people are on the pitch... they think it's all over...' One of those pitch invaders wasMichael Richardson, a Londoner who was 17 at the time and a drummer with a rock group. 'I had a seat near the front opposite the Royal Box and I clambered on to the pitch. It was sheer elation. I wasn't a hooligan or anything. I didn't get very far, no farther than the touchline before I was dragged off by six policemen. I wasn't thrown out - they just dropped me back in the crowd. There was a real carnival atmosphere.' That night he played at Tiffany's in central London. 'Everybody was buzzing. Great days.' Richardson, still drumming, for singer Elkie Brooks, is not impressed with what they're doing to the old stadium. 'Nostalgia isn't what it used to be,' he says gloomily. And if he thinks it's all over for the stage where he briefly achieved fame... it is now.

      "body": "<p><strong> LUCAS NEILL</strong> </p> <p><strong> Millwall/Australia, Midfielder</strong> </p> <p> Australia's Olympic games disappointment should provide a strong incentive ahead of the Oceania World Cup tournament. Neill - whose regular international call-ups have irritated Millwall - is a versatile midfielder, considered one good season away from a move to a bigger club. </p> <p>Signed on a free in November 1995, the 22-year-old made an excellent early impression as defender, midfielder and striker, voted Player of the Year and earning his first senior international cap. A series of injuries slowed his rate of progress, but his form and his adaptability has recovered: whoever takes over as Millwall's new manager will be pleased with the versatile Neill. </p> <p><strong> Australia </strong> have a decent chance of qualification: Neill and colleagues face Tonga, Fiji, American Samoa and Samoa in Group One. </p> <p> <strong> TEPI MOILANEN</strong> </p> <p><strong> Preston/Finland, Goalkeeper</strong> </p> <p> Preston keeper Tepi Moilanen could be famous by the end of next month. The 6ft 5in Finn, currently enjoying professional anonymity at Deepdale, will become public, tabloid property in the build-up to his country's World Cup qualifier against England in Helsinki next month. </p> <p>Moilanen, an AC/DC fan nicknamed Tepi, is vying with Bolton's Jussi Jaaskelainen for the Finnish number one jersey, and on current form is a likely starter. </p> <p>After arriving from Jaro, struggling to adapt and spending time on loan toughening up at Scarborough and Darlington, Tepi displaced England youth keeper David Lucas to become first choice. </p> <p><strong> Finland's </strong> chances of reaching the finals are mixed: they opened with a 2-1 win over Albania, but this World Cup may have arrived two years early. They can, though, be tough to beat in Helsinki - as England will doubtless prove. </p> <p> <strong> STEFAN THORDARSON</strong> </p> <p><strong> Stoke/Iceland, Midfielder</strong> </p> <p> One of the growing Icelandic contingent at the Britannia Stadium, Thordarson has settled quickly since arriving on a free from Bayer Uerdingen - catching the eye early on with a vicious free kick against Liverpool in pre-season. He's no relation to Gudjon Thordarson, the manager who brought him to England in the summer, but did play under him when the Stoke boss was in charge of the national team. </p> <p><strong> Iceland</strong> remain unremarkable on the international stage. They were unlucky to lose 2-1 to Denmark in their opening Group Three qualifier in Reykjavik last month, but the coming trip to the Czech Republic offers little cause for optimism in a group which also contains Bulgaria and Northern Ireland. Iceland are up-and-coming - ranked 52 in the world - but Thordarson and colleagues will have to battle to make it to Japan. </p> <p> <strong> IVAN TISTIMETANU</strong> </p> <p><strong> Bristol C/Moldova, Defender</strong> </p> <p> Signed by Benny Lennartsson for \u00a3225,000 in December 1998, Tistimetanu was quickly dubbed 'Iron Testicles' by Bristol City fans impressed by the wildness of his challenges, and by the complexities of his surname. When Tistimetanu tackles, they say, you stay tackled. </p> <p>The two-time Moldovan player of the year and leader of his country's World Cup bid is as well liked in Bristol as he is at home - adding capable midfield qualities to his defensive hard man reputation. Comfortable on the ball, and with a shot which would burst nets if on target more often, he's proved himself an invaluable ball-winner - but still needs to convince new manager Danny Wilson to make him part of his long-term plans. </p> <p><strong> Moldova </strong> had a losing start in Group four, going down 2-0 in Turkey - they'll need to do better against Slovakia, Azerbaijan and Macedonia to stand a chance. </p> <p> <strong> VITALY ASTAFJEVS</strong> </p> <p><strong> Bristol R/Latvia, Midfielder</strong> </p> <p> Before Astafjevs - Latvia's most capped player - arrived at Bristol Rovers, the club had only one foreigner, and he was a Scot. But, with the midfielder settled in and performing well after his protracted transfer from Skonta Riga, Rovers are realising the benefit of importing a creative influence. </p> <p>The fans have taken him to heart with an 'Ooh aah, it's a Latvian' chant (inspired by the Ambrosia ad). 'He's become a real favourite here,' says Rovers' commercial manager Ralph Ellis. 'You don't get many foreign players at this level so we had to be sure we were getting the right man for the job. He has already proved us right.' </p> <p>Astafjevs is also the key man and captain in the plans of <strong> Latvia </strong> manager Gary Johnson - but, having already lost to Scotland, the side have a lot to do to avoid an early end to their campaign. </p> <p> <strong> EFETOBORE SODJE</strong> </p> <p><strong> Crewe/Nigeria, Defender</strong> </p> <p> Regular international duty nearly ended Efe Sodje's career in England: during the summer, Colchester lost patience with his regular absences and released him. Rescued by Crewe manager Dario Gradi, the Greenwich-born, bandana-wearing Sodje will be a certain squad member in 2002, barring a dramatic loss of form. </p> <p>Having spent much of his career regarded as one of the best lower-league defenders around, now, at the age of 27, his long-touted move into the big-time looks unlikely. A strong performer, he began his career at Stevenage and is a regular in Nigeria's 'Super Eagles' squad - though still rarely a first team starter. His famous bandana (Motto: Against All Odds) is worn on the advice of his mother, who won't allow him to take it off. </p> <p><strong> Nigeria's </strong> standing in Africa is akin to France's in Europe: they will qualify - and they're contenders for the trophy. </p> <p> <strong> WALTER BOYD</strong> </p> <p><strong> Swansea/Jamaica, Striker</strong> </p> <p> Time was when Jamaica was known only for the three R's - reggae, rastafarianism and Red Stripe - but, in the last four years, the Caribbean island's football team has emerged as a must-watch side, with a world ranking of 38. </p> <p>Swansea's Boyd, a powerful forward who has been a regular goalscorer in Division Three, is a folk hero back home: popular manager Rene Simoes almost found himself hounded out of office when he briefly overlooked Boyd's talents. </p> <p>Now that many of the 'bandwagon jumpers' - players like Robbie Earle and Fitzroy Simpson who discovered their Caribbean heritage just in time to play in the last World Cup - have gone, the <strong> Jamaica </strong> squad are determined to prove that their success last time was not a one-off. They've won group D, and could well be one of the three to qualify from the northern and central American zone. </p> <p> <strong> FAN ZHIYI</strong> </p> <p><strong> Crystal Palace/China, Defender</strong> </p> <p> Fan Zhiyi's first goal in English football against Bury two years ago was seen by 3,546 at Selhurst Park - and 500 million in China. After 64 appearances, 1.3bn Chinese viewers remain captivated: those who can afford to, attend the matches, the rest watch on national television. </p> <p>Fan's form in England has peaked this year: an 11sec 100m runner, he's proved himself dynamic in defence and powerful in attack - also leading a 22-man brawl against Forest earlier this season. A hundred million pre-teen Chinese groupies will be seeing a lot more of him during next month's Asian Games - he'll miss a month of football for Palace, before he returns to China for World Cup qualifying. </p> <p><strong> China's</strong> chances are better now than ever before. They're led by Bora Milutinovic - who has taken Costa Rica, Mexico, USA and Nigeria to previous finals - and recently beat Guam 19-0. </p> <p> <strong> STERN JOHN</strong> </p> <p><strong> Nottingham Forest/Trinidad, Striker</strong> </p> <p> Lazy or lacking in confidence? Forest fans still aren't sure what to make of Dwight Yorke's international partner. When he arrived for \u00a31.5m from American MLS side Columbus Crew in November, David Platt was keen to protect him: 'It's unfair to heap pressure on his shoulders - we can't expect too much.' But after a debut goal and assist, and the knowledge that John had scored 52 in 65 games for his previous club, fans have been disappointed with the lack of fireworks since. </p> <p>But John, 25 next month, is still recovering from a cruciate ligament injury suffered two months into his Forest career. He made a remarkable comeback before the end of the season, but is still sluggish and under-achieving. His <strong> Trinidad &amp; Tobago</strong> place, though, is secure - he's been capped 30 times, and manager Ian Porterfield, whose side are progressing well through qualifying, expects big things. </p> <p> <strong> MOHAMED CAMARA</strong> </p> <p><strong> Wolves/Guinea, Defender</strong> </p> <p> Wolves' new defender Mohamed Camara (there are more Mohamed Camara's in Guinea than there are John Smith's in England) has followed Liverpool's Titi and Inter Milan's Zoumana in promoting the Camara name in European football. The 26-year-old, though, is yet to make his Wolves debut following a long-term loan move from Le Havre this summer, but remains an international regular. </p> <p><strong> Guinea </strong> have much in their favour as they try to reach the finals for the first time, including Fifa's decision to grant Africa five qualifying places and their Fifa world ranking of 78 - above Northern Ireland and Wales. Nevertheless, winning Group E, is likely to prove difficult. A good start, with victories over Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso, has put them top of the table, but they'll be tested to the limit when they play away to South Africa, the favourites, in March. </p> <p> <strong> BAICHUNG BHUTIA</strong> </p> <p><strong> Bury/India, Striker</strong> </p> <p> The first, and so far only, footballer from the sub-continent to play in England, Baichung Bhutia has made a big impression at Bury - even though he still hasn't attracted the hordes of new Asian fans the club's marketing men had hoped would follow him to Gigg Lane. </p> <p>The 24-year-old striker was brought up in the eastern Indian state of Sikkim and established his reputation with East Bengal, one of the country's top sides. Powerfully built, he's coped well with the physical side of Second Division life, and has developed his game rapidly. Whether <strong> India</strong> will progress far enough for him to play in 2002, though, remains to be seen. Since the country withdrew from the 1950 Finals after being told their players could not play barefoot, India have disappeared from the world stage. A mini-revival has begun, but it's unlikely to be enough to beat the likes of Iran, Saudi Arabia and China.</p>",

They were unlucky to lose 2-1 to Denmark in their opening Group Three qualifier in Reykjavik last month, but the coming trip to the Czech Republic offers little cause for optimism in a group which also contains Bulgaria and Northern Ireland. Iceland are up-and-coming - ranked 52 in the world - but Thordarson and colleagues will have to battle to make it to Japan. IVAN TISTIMETANU Bristol C/Moldova, Defender Signed by Benny Lennartsson for \u00a3225,000 in December 1998, Tistimetanu was quickly dubbed 'Iron Testicles' by Bristol City fans impressed by the wildness of his challenges, and by the complexities of his surname. When Tistimetanu tackles, they say, you stay tackled. The two-time Moldovan player of the year and leader of his country's World Cup bid is as well liked in Bristol as he is at home - adding capable midfield qualities to his defensive hard man reputation. Comfortable on the ball, and with a shot which would burst nets if on target more often, he's proved himself an invaluable ball-winner - but still needs to convince new manager Danny Wilson to make him part of his long-term plans. Moldova had a losing start in Group four, going down 2-0 in Turkey - they'll need to do better against Slovakia, Azerbaijan and Macedonia to stand a chance. VITALY ASTAFJEVS Bristol R/Latvia, Midfielder Before Astafjevs - Latvia's most capped player - arrived at Bristol Rovers, the club had only one foreigner, and he was a Scot. But, with the midfielder settled in and performing well after his protracted transfer from Skonta Riga, Rovers are realising the benefit of importing a creative influence. The fans have taken him to heart with an 'Ooh aah, it's a Latvian' chant (inspired by the Ambrosia ad). 'He's become a real favourite here,' says Rovers' commercial manager Ralph Ellis. 'You don't get many foreign players at this level so we had to be sure we were getting the right man for the job. He has already proved us right.' Astafjevs is also the key man and captain in the plans of Latvia manager Gary Johnson - but, having already lost to Scotland, the side have a lot to do to avoid an early end to their campaign. EFETOBORE SODJE Crewe/Nigeria, Defender Regular international duty nearly ended Efe Sodje's career in England: during the summer, Colchester lost patience with his regular absences and released him. Rescued by Crewe manager Dario Gradi, the Greenwich-born, bandana-wearing Sodje will be a certain squad member in 2002, barring a dramatic loss of form. Having spent much of his career regarded as one of the best lower-league defenders around, now, at the age of 27, his long-touted move into the big-time looks unlikely. A strong performer, he began his career at Stevenage and is a regular in Nigeria's 'Super Eagles' squad - though still rarely a first team starter. His famous bandana (Motto: Against All Odds) is worn on the advice of his mother, who won't allow him to take it off. Nigeria's standing in Africa is akin to France's in Europe: they will qualify - and they're contenders for the trophy. WALTER BOYD Swansea/Jamaica, Striker Time was when Jamaica was known only for the three R's - reggae, rastafarianism and Red Stripe - but, in the last four years, the Caribbean island's football team has emerged as a must-watch side, with a world ranking of 38. Swansea's Boyd, a powerful forward who has been a regular goalscorer in Division Three, is a folk hero back home: popular manager Rene Simoes almost found himself hounded out of office when he briefly overlooked Boyd's talents. Now that many of the 'bandwagon jumpers' - players like Robbie Earle and Fitzroy Simpson who discovered their Caribbean heritage just in time to play in the last World Cup - have gone, the Jamaica squad are determined to prove that their success last time was not a one-off. They've won group D, and could well be one of the three to qualify from the northern and central American zone. FAN ZHIYI Crystal Palace/China, Defender Fan Zhiyi's first goal in English football against Bury two years ago was seen by 3,546 at Selhurst Park - and 500 million in China. After 64 appearances, 1.3bn Chinese viewers remain captivated: those who can afford to, attend the matches, the rest watch on national television. Fan's form in England has peaked this year: an 11sec 100m runner, he's proved himself dynamic in defence and powerful in attack - also leading a 22-man brawl against Forest earlier this season. A hundred million pre-teen Chinese groupies will be seeing a lot more of him during next month's Asian Games - he'll miss a month of football for Palace, before he returns to China for World Cup qualifying. China's chances are better now than ever before. They're led by Bora Milutinovic - who has taken Costa Rica, Mexico, USA and Nigeria to previous finals - and recently beat Guam 19-0. STERN JOHN Nottingham Forest/Trinidad, Striker Lazy or lacking in confidence? Forest fans still aren't sure what to make of Dwight Yorke's international partner. When he arrived for \u00a31.5m from American MLS side Columbus Crew in November, David Platt was keen to protect him: 'It's unfair to heap pressure on his shoulders - we can't expect too much.' But after a debut goal and assist, and the knowledge that John had scored 52 in 65 games for his previous club, fans have been disappointed with the lack of fireworks since. But John, 25 next month, is still recovering from a cruciate ligament injury suffered two months into his Forest career. He made a remarkable comeback before the end of the season, but is still sluggish and under-achieving. His Trinidad &amp; Tobago place, though, is secure - he's been capped 30 times, and manager Ian Porterfield, whose side are progressing well through qualifying, expects big things. MOHAMED CAMARA Wolves/Guinea, Defender Wolves' new defender Mohamed Camara (there are more Mohamed Camara's in Guinea than there are John Smith's in England) has followed Liverpool's Titi and Inter Milan's Zoumana in promoting the Camara name in European football. The 26-year-old, though, is yet to make his Wolves debut following a long-term loan move from Le Havre this summer, but remains an international regular. Guinea have much in their favour as they try to reach the finals for the first time, including Fifa's decision to grant Africa five qualifying places and their Fifa world ranking of 78 - above Northern Ireland and Wales. Nevertheless, winning Group E, is likely to prove difficult. A good start, with victories over Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso, has put them top of the table, but they'll be tested to the limit when they play away to South Africa, the favourites, in March. BAICHUNG BHUTIA Bury/India, Striker The first, and so far only, footballer from the sub-continent to play in England, Baichung Bhutia has made a big impression at Bury - even though he still hasn't attracted the hordes of new Asian fans the club's marketing men had hoped would follow him to Gigg Lane. The 24-year-old striker was brought up in the eastern Indian state of Sikkim and established his reputation with East Bengal, one of the country's top sides. Powerfully built, he's coped well with the physical side of Second Division life, and has developed his game rapidly. Whether India will progress far enough for him to play in 2002, though, remains to be seen. Since the country withdrew from the 1950 Finals after being told their players could not play barefoot, India have disappeared from the world stage. A mini-revival has begun, but it's unlikely to be enough to beat the likes of Iran, Saudi Arabia and China.",

At present, only Argentina are doing so, but Brazil's failures - in four away matches to date, the 1998 World Cup finalists have managed one win and one draw, scoring only two goals in the process - are proving far more entertaining to aficionados of the hysterical, a phrase recently added to Fifa's list of approved synonyms for 'supporter'. </p> <p>Already we may have seen the last, alas, of the dapper and debonair Brazilian manager, Wanderley Luxemburgo (he of his own wonderful website). For in 'The Land of Ten Thousand Strikers' it is no small embarrassment to have had only two players score goals in more than one of the eight qualifying matches played so far. And it's even worse when, Rivaldo being one, the other is the Roma defender Zago. </p> <p>Surely there was no relation between the two, but only days after Brazil's 3-0 humiliation by Chile, Luxemburgo was charged with tax evasion. Yes, the rusty but inexorable steam engine of Brazilian justice had started to chuff, and not even a subsequent win over hapless Bolivia was able to stop it. </p> <p>Indeed, Luxemborgo's former secretary and lover suddenly moved centre stage, describing for the media 'suitcases stuffed with dollars' in the home they had once shared. Alas, poor Wanderley: he had forgotten the dictum about keeping one's pleasure separate from one's business, especially if one is going to lose to Chile and Peru, and draw with Colombia and Uruguay. </p> <p>For the ex, whose name was Renata Alves, and who herself had been charged with tax evasion, produced a 'little black book' which she said she'd taken from 'their' home when she departed. The book, she said, contained the names of 37 Brazilian players with whom Luxemburgo allegedly had engaged in business practices which had maximised profit by defrauding the government. </p> <p>'I am only speaking out to save my honour,' Ms Alves explained, 'and of course I cannot disclose any of the individual names.' </p> <p>'Well, let me ask you this,' said an enterprising member of the press. 'Among those 37 names would we find, for example, Elivelton, Zinho, Mazinho and Edilson?' </p> <p>'Yes.' </p> <p>But she added that absolutely, not for love nor money, would she disclose the names of the remaining 33. On further behalf of the salvation of her honour, however, Ms Alves did claim that Luxemburgo, while still a club manager, had taken illegal commissions from the sale prices of his players and had used these proceeds to buy at auction certain properties which 'friends' had assured him could be immediately resold for vast profit, with no traces of the transactions appearing on the tax registers. </p> <p>There's a time for fight and a time for flight, and Luxemburgo wasted no time deciding which time it was this time. He flew immediately from Conmebol to Australia, where he vowed to restore his honour by coaching the Brazilian Olympic football team to a gold medal. </p> <p>'They're launching a campaign against me,' he declared. 'I don't know where it's coming from, but I'm being massacred. I don't know who they are, but they're trying to topple me, and the worst part is, I don't even know why.' </p> <p>Let me count the ways, suggested several Brazilian sports columnists, and proceeded to list the forwards Luxemburgo had used in qualifying matches, and those he had ignored. </p> <p>There was, for example, the 'dynamic duo' from Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro: Guilherme de Cassia Alves (no blood relation to Ms Renata Alves has been alleged), and Marques Batista de Abreu, whose selection seemed so bizarre it caused speculation that places on Brazil's national team were, to put it bluntly, up for sale. No formal charge to that effect has yet been brought, but it must be said that the abundance of domestic strikers used at the expense of those playing in Europe has been, well, striking. </p> <p>Francoaldo Sena Souza Franca was chosen from S\u00e3o Paolo; Edilson, who had scored one goal during his club season, came from Flamengo; and another who had failed in Europe, Luis Carlos Goulart Luizao, arrived from Corinthians. None of the above has yet managed to score for Brazil in a Conmebol World Cup qualifier, and their selection by Luxemburgo comes to seem all the more remarkable when one considers forwards over whom his roving eye has passed without pause. That list would include such Europe-based talents as Jardel, Elber, Paulo Sergio, Leonardo, Sonny Anderson, Savio, Jamelli, etc. Even Romario was excluded until after the 3-0 humiliation by Chile. Once added to the team, he immediately scored three goals, making Luxemburgo look all the more stupid - or worse - for not having negotiated his inclusion much sooner. </p> <p>And now, once again, alas poor Wanderley: if he'd thought a Sydney sojourn would grant him respite from his woes, he was once more wide of the mark. For his Olympic team - the team he had chosen and the team he now coached - contrived almost immediately to lose to South Africa. A Brazilian team of any sort losing to South Africa? The cries for Luxemburgo's head (not to mention his wardrobe, and the 'suitcases stuffed with dollars') have at least temporarily silenced the samba beat from the gaudy beaches of Rio to the sombre hallways of Brasilia. Edmundo is facing a four-year prison term for vehicular homicide. But for Wanderley, it seems, nothing less than life (or death) will do. </p> <p>Facing a mid-October court date, which promises to be only the first among many, Luxemburgo might be thinking by now of political asylum.

There, political asylum might prove only the start. Has anyone seen the Luxembourgian national side in action lately? Has anyone noted that manager Paul Phillip hardly cuts a bella figura? For that matter, the whole damned duchy has been looking a little dowdy of late. Wandering Wanderley might be just the man to provide the needed panache. And who knows?

      "body": "<p>At the end of a week in which his team virtually secured passage to the second group phase of the Champions League - a historic achievement that was denied them in cruel circumstances last season - the Rangers manager, Dick Advocaat, should have been trilling like a nightingale on speed. Instead, the little Dutchman was apprehensive, fretful and, like Benjamin Braddock in The Graduate, worried about his future. </p> <p>Advocaat dropped the broadest hint so far that he is unlikely to extend his contract with the Scottish champions beyond its expiry date in the summer of 2002, news that will practically nauseate supporters who regard him as the single most important figure in Rangers' resurgence since the league championship was lost to Celtic in 1998. </p> <p>Their reverence deepened last Wednesday night, when the 1-0 victory over Monaco in Monte Carlo took them into a clear lead in Group D, with six points from two matches, six goals scored and none conceded. With two of their remaining four games in the series at home - to Galatasaray and Monaco - the Ibrox side are long odds-on to reach stage two. </p> <p>Advocaat's anxiety derives from the pressures under which he has to strive not only to maintain Rangers' domination of the domestic game, but to improve their quality to a level at which they can compete as credible contenders in Europe's premier competition. </p> <p>He is also gravely concerned about the effects on clubs such as Rangers - and Celtic, for that matter - of the abolition of transfer fees, a development he fears will make life for Old Firm managers even more difficult than it is already. </p> <p>'The outside pressures I feel may have an influence when it comes time for me to make a decision over my contract in 2002,' said Advocaat, who, for a manager who rations his time with the media, can be extraordinarily candid. 'Money certainly won't come into it. </p> <p>'Of course, It's better to have money than not, but the most important thing is to be healthy. In any case, what's the difference when you talk about the kind of money we earn? Another \u00a310,000 a week wouldn't make that much difference, after tax and other deductions. No, that won't be a factor. </p> <p>'I've found the last eight months extremely demanding, much more than at any other time in my managerial career. People don't realise what you have to do to get new players in. You make calls, then you do it again and again and again. You have to spend so much energy on things which, to the outside world, look easy. </p> <p>'I coach as well, you know, but I don't feel I have the time to do different things in my job. There are so many outside pressures. But at least with Rangers, I have only to deal with our chairman, David Murray. When Wim Jansen was manager of Celtic, he used to tell me how he had to work with Fergus (McCann) and all the other people at Parkhead.' </p> <p>The possible onset of utter freedom of movement for players - without fees - seems to have convinced Advocaat that work which is already making serious demands of him could become intolerable. It is interesting that he should make reference to health being more important than money, suggesting that his manic involvement in every game - he is one of the most tempestuous and animated of managers - is becoming too taxing. </p> <p>'Whatever they may be saying about modifying the law to make football an exceptional case, something major is going to happen, there's no doubt about that,' he said. 'And it's going to make it even harder to get players in. </p> <p>'With Rangers - and Celtic, too - you always have to win. There is far more pressure on me in Scotland than there ever was in Holland. I would say that, without doubt, the pressure on the Old Firm in Scotland is the same as it is in places like Spain, Italy and England.' </p> <p>These are extraordinary admissions from a man who has seemed, since his arrival more than two years ago, to revel in the fray. From Advocaat's present concerns and his gloomy peek into the future, it is difficult not to infer that, by the end of next season, when he will be approaching 55, he will have had enough. </p> <p>None of this, of course, will interfere with his present ambition to take Rangers further in Europe, the next obstacle looming on Wednesday when Advocaat takes them to Istanbul for the confrontation with Galatasaray at the Ali Yami Sen Stadium. </p> <p>The notorious reputation established by this hostile venue is, in the opinion of the Rangers defender, Bert Konterman, entirely justified. The Dutchman has been there and gone through an experience he is unlikely to forget. Indeed, he almost stumbled over his words in his rush to recount it when asked about the time he played for Feyenoord against Galatasaray. </p> <p>'It was just a friendly during the winter shutdown, but there was still a full house,' said Konterman. 'And it is quite mad. It was bad enough that we should end the first half 2-0 down, but it became worse when we discovered at the interval that the dressing-room had been broken into. </p> <p>'I had a mobile phone stolen and other players had things like wedding rings taken. Mind you, it made us angry enough to go out and turn the 2-0 deficit into a 2-2 draw. It's a dangerous place all right, but we now have matters in our own hands. We have two home matches to come and winning them would make certain we go through.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>With football's transfer policy on death row and the game's power brokers and legal experts racking their brains for ways to save the status quo, a straight-talking Belfast boy could make a powerful case for the defence. </p> <p>Neil Lennon's long, winding route to the top of British football was full of stepping stones and helping hands. Without them he might never have made the leap from teenage rejection, through washing and ironing his own kit, driving around in an old red Cortina with black doors and playing in a stadium with nettles growing on the terraces, to a reported salary of \u00a330,000 per week, Wembley finals and European football. </p> <p>He'll tell you all about those vital apprenticeship years at Manchester City, where habits were formed and skills honed. He'll praise the system for giving him a second chance, a new door opening for him at Crewe Alexandra when City pointed him to the exit and left him bawling his eyes out. He'll regale you with affectionate stories of life at the Alex, where manager Dario Gradi helped him progress enough to attract attention from the higher divisions. </p> <p>Crewe needed Lennon just as Lennon needed Crewe (the club's existence depends on nurturing and selling talent) and if a reason were needed for preserving the transfer market, this symbiotic relationship is it. </p> <p>Lennon has a similar bond with his current club, Leicester City. In the summer Celtic and Aston Villa tried to prise him away, but he chose to stay at a place which makes him bubble with happiness. 'When I came here I wanted to do what I did at Crewe, to be the top dog, to be Leicester's Roy Keane, and I think I've done that. I've got my niche here. When people mention Leicester they automatically think of Matt Elliott, Muzzy Izzet, Neil Lennon. We've earned that over the years.' </p> <p>That status, coupled with the genuine enjoyment he gleans from being in a squad with so many firm friends, means a great deal. 'At certain clubs,' he explains, 'you go in, don't talk to anybody, train, go home. I wouldn't want to be a footballer in that environment. You could see it at Chelsea. A lot of their players were playing for themselves, not for each other. That's one thing we've never done here.' </p> <p>Putting one over the bigshots from the Bridge last weekend, and simultaneously joining Manchester United at the Premiership summit, was an 'awesome' moment for Lennon's Leicester. 'I think they look upon playing clubs like us as a chore rather than a challenge. Clubs like that look down on us.' It rankles that credit for City's victory was overlooked compared to the spotlight on turbulence at Chelsea. It was all about how Claudio Ranieri would fare in place of Gianluca Vialli. The fact that Peter Taylor is constructing a brave new world after taking over from his idolised predecessor Martin O'Neill passed virtually unnoticed. </p> <p>Taylor's enthusiasm made an immediate impact on his new charges. It can't have been easy to come into a club with three influential figures - all proteges of O'Neill - pondering their futures. Persuading Lennon, Izzet and Elliott to sign improved contracts at the club made a profound and crucial statement. 'Three or four years ago we'd have all gone,' admits the 29-year-old midfielder. 'The message is: \"We're here. We're not a selling club\".' </p> <p>Not that it was an easy decision, in fact, it gave Lennon anguished, sleepless nights. His heart was torn between his pals in the squad and a magnet drawing him towards Celtic, the club of his boyhood dreams and his charismatic mentor O'Neill (He still calls O'Neill gaffer and suspects he always will, echoing O'Neill's reverence to his own guru Brian Clough). Wages were not a factor for Lennon - indeed he felt anxious that people would expect a 30-yard volley every five minutes as recompense for a rise - but Taylor's persuasive line struck a chord. 'He was really honest with me. He said: \"Look Lennie, I'm not prepared to let you go.\" He told me it would be a backward step going to Scotland and that the Premiership was the place to be. He outlined his plans for the squad and asked me to give him a chance. </p> <p>'Peter has done tremendously well. That was a bloody hard act to follow. He's definitely his own man, which is what we needed -- a strong character. He has a really good sense of humour, which I find refreshing as well. Martin was hilarious at times but could also be aloof and unpredictable, which kept you on your toes, whereas Peter is very hands-on at the training ground and likes to be one of the lads. He cares passionately about his players, always on the phone if someone is injured or down. That's new too. You could always go to talk to Martin but he'd rarely come to you.' Lennon is careful to add that this is not a criticism, merely an explanation of differing styles. 'How could you knock Martin after all he did here?' </p> <p>If early portents are to be believed, it won't be easy to knock Peter either. Results (four wins, two draws, no defeats, and a virtually unbreachable defence) speak for themselves. What's more, he has revived a clutch of players, and Lennon reckons a fresh start has breathed new life into Andy Impey, Darren Eadie and Stan Collymore. Taylor has also recruited quality newcomers, which impresses the old guard and puts Lennon in bullish mood. </p> <p>'If people think there's something wrong with the British game they should look at us - it's not all doom and gloom. There are a lot of British players about who can cope with the best around. I looked at Chelsea's team last Sunday and to be fair they have millions worth of talent, all quality players, but I know who I'd rather play for. I'd rather play for our boys because I know what they are going to give me. </p> <p>'If you are getting the cream, the Vieiras, Henrys, Stams, Desaillys, that's great, but there are a lot of foreign players coming into the game who aren't as good as people perceive them to be originally. It's stunting the growth of talent in England and hopefully they will bring in a cull. It's a hell of a lot harder for a 19-year-old to get in the game now than when I was 19. The game is going away.

      "bodyText": "With football's transfer policy on death row and the game's power brokers and legal experts racking their brains for ways to save the status quo, a straight-talking Belfast boy could make a powerful case for the defence. Neil Lennon's long, winding route to the top of British football was full of stepping stones and helping hands. Without them he might never have made the leap from teenage rejection, through washing and ironing his own kit, driving around in an old red Cortina with black doors and playing in a stadium with nettles growing on the terraces, to a reported salary of \u00a330,000 per week, Wembley finals and European football. He'll tell you all about those vital apprenticeship years at Manchester City, where habits were formed and skills honed. He'll praise the system for giving him a second chance, a new door opening for him at Crewe Alexandra when City pointed him to the exit and left him bawling his eyes out. He'll regale you with affectionate stories of life at the Alex, where manager Dario Gradi helped him progress enough to attract attention from the higher divisions. Crewe needed Lennon just as Lennon needed Crewe (the club's existence depends on nurturing and selling talent) and if a reason were needed for preserving the transfer market, this symbiotic relationship is it. Lennon has a similar bond with his current club, Leicester City. In the summer Celtic and Aston Villa tried to prise him away, but he chose to stay at a place which makes him bubble with happiness. 'When I came here I wanted to do what I did at Crewe, to be the top dog, to be Leicester's Roy Keane, and I think I've done that. I've got my niche here. When people mention Leicester they automatically think of Matt Elliott, Muzzy Izzet, Neil Lennon. We've earned that over the years.' That status, coupled with the genuine enjoyment he gleans from being in a squad with so many firm friends, means a great deal. 'At certain clubs,' he explains, 'you go in, don't talk to anybody, train, go home. I wouldn't want to be a footballer in that environment. You could see it at Chelsea. A lot of their players were playing for themselves, not for each other. That's one thing we've never done here.' Putting one over the bigshots from the Bridge last weekend, and simultaneously joining Manchester United at the Premiership summit, was an 'awesome' moment for Lennon's Leicester. 'I think they look upon playing clubs like us as a chore rather than a challenge. Clubs like that look down on us.' It rankles that credit for City's victory was overlooked compared to the spotlight on turbulence at Chelsea. It was all about how Claudio Ranieri would fare in place of Gianluca Vialli. The fact that Peter Taylor is constructing a brave new world after taking over from his idolised predecessor Martin O'Neill passed virtually unnoticed. Taylor's enthusiasm made an immediate impact on his new charges. It can't have been easy to come into a club with three influential figures - all proteges of O'Neill - pondering their futures. Persuading Lennon, Izzet and Elliott to sign improved contracts at the club made a profound and crucial statement. 'Three or four years ago we'd have all gone,' admits the 29-year-old midfielder. 'The message is: \"We're here. We're not a selling club\".' Not that it was an easy decision, in fact, it gave Lennon anguished, sleepless nights. His heart was torn between his pals in the squad and a magnet drawing him towards Celtic, the club of his boyhood dreams and his charismatic mentor O'Neill (He still calls O'Neill gaffer and suspects he always will, echoing O'Neill's reverence to his own guru Brian Clough). Wages were not a factor for Lennon - indeed he felt anxious that people would expect a 30-yard volley every five minutes as recompense for a rise - but Taylor's persuasive line struck a chord. 'He was really honest with me. He said: \"Look Lennie, I'm not prepared to let you go.\" He told me it would be a backward step going to Scotland and that the Premiership was the place to be. He outlined his plans for the squad and asked me to give him a chance. 'Peter has done tremendously well. That was a bloody hard act to follow. He's definitely his own man, which is what we needed -- a strong character. He has a really good sense of humour, which I find refreshing as well. Martin was hilarious at times but could also be aloof and unpredictable, which kept you on your toes, whereas Peter is very hands-on at the training ground and likes to be one of the lads. He cares passionately about his players, always on the phone if someone is injured or down. That's new too. You could always go to talk to Martin but he'd rarely come to you.' Lennon is careful to add that this is not a criticism, merely an explanation of differing styles. 'How could you knock Martin after all he did here?' If early portents are to be believed, it won't be easy to knock Peter either. Results (four wins, two draws, no defeats, and a virtually unbreachable defence) speak for themselves. What's more, he has revived a clutch of players, and Lennon reckons a fresh start has breathed new life into Andy Impey, Darren Eadie and Stan Collymore. Taylor has also recruited quality newcomers, which impresses the old guard and puts Lennon in bullish mood. 'If people think there's something wrong with the British game they should look at us - it's not all doom and gloom. There are a lot of British players about who can cope with the best around. I looked at Chelsea's team last Sunday and to be fair they have millions worth of talent, all quality players, but I know who I'd rather play for. I'd rather play for our boys because I know what they are going to give me. 'If you are getting the cream, the Vieiras, Henrys, Stams, Desaillys, that's great, but there are a lot of foreign players coming into the game who aren't as good as people perceive them to be originally. It's stunting the growth of talent in England and hopefully they will bring in a cull. It's a hell of a lot harder for a 19-year-old to get in the game now than when I was 19. The game is going away. You go to Old Trafford and it's not a football stadium, it's a city. I don't recognise the place at all.' He laments the fact he can barely recognise the game he grew up in. The thought of Sturm Graz in the Champions League makes him groan. Having said that, should Leicester keep up their early pace, continuing today against Everton, they might even qualify themselves. The idea provokes an interesting reaction which is Leicester all over: half a flicker of fantasy, half self-mockery. 'The chairman mentioned it the other day and the lads went \"Eh?!\" We're happy to get 40 points first and talk about the Champions League after that. We're top of the league after six games and we're not getting blas\u00e9. Two defeats and you're back around 10th, which is where all the lads reckon we'll end up anyway.

He still hadn't calmed down when he did his television interviews, and in the press room afterwards the normally mild-mannered manager bristled with indignance and rounded on individual reporters as if he had just come back from a seminar on sarcasm conducted by Sir Alex Ferguson. </p> <p>What was bothering O'Leary was not the disgruntled supporter who told 5 Live that the reason Leeds had lost at home to Ipswich Town was that their manager was saving himself for the Arsenal job, amusing though that was. O'Leary was upset because one of the local papers had had the temerity to use the word 'crisis' in conjunction with the club's slump in form.

Anyway, if you are playing in the Champions League any crisis can only be relative.

And can any club really be in crisis if they can beat AC Milan and sit, however unexpectedly, level on points with Barcelona in one of the toughest of Champions League groups? </p> <p>O'Leary thinks not, and certainly the way Leeds played on Tuesday belied any suggestion of flagging morale. A 0-0 draw might have been the result Milan were looking for, but even allowing for the fact that the Italian season has not yet started and Serie A superstars are rarely seen at their best on wet nights in West Yorkshire, Leeds would have been full value for the point they looked to have earned until Dida's blunder brought the bonus of all three. </p> <p>It would have been interesting to see O'Leary's reaction had the match remained scoreless. No blame could have attached to a Leeds side missing half a dozen regulars and featuring several players out of position had they drawn, and O'Leary would have been just as entitled to claim a moral victory and salute the spirit of his players. Yet because of Barcelona's defeat in Istanbul, such an outcome at Elland Road would have put Milan on top of Group H and Leeds bottom. That really would have been bad news, since for all O'Leary's enjoyable invective last season about the principle of Champions League losers dropping into the Uefa Cup halfway through - 'As far as I am concerned it is an absolute joke' - there can be little doubt that realistically Leeds have their sights on third position and a continued run in Europe. </p> <p>Maybe it was not always so, but there are only so many knocks a team can take, and when you have lost your best player until after Christmas, your captain to a neck injury and suffered two successive home defeats by newly pro moted teams either side of a 4-0 mauling in Barcelona, you can be forgiven for warming to the Uefa Cup. That's not even mentioning the extra baggage Leeds are carrying - the unwelcome return to Turkey next month or the assault charges some players will soon be answering in court. Performing against the odds often seems to bring out the best in Leeds, but even after what O'Leary conceded was a flukey winner against Milan there are few grounds for supposing his team can finish in the top two. </p> <p>Most Leeds supporters took the view before the Milan game that third place and another crack at the Uefa Cup would be a respectable achievement for a club still on a learning curve. The trouble is that Leeds finishing third was an assumption based on Besiktas finishing bottom, which would have been fine if only someone had remembered to tell the Turks. Now Leeds find themselves grateful for three points against Milan just to stay in touch with the group's perceived whipping boys. Anything is still possible in a group in which all four teams have one win and one defeat each, but the fact remains that three of the wins were by convincing margins, whereas Leeds' was something of a gift. </p> <p>So it is that Tuesday's home game against Besiktas will now shape the rest of Leeds' season. Nothing less than a win will do if Leeds are going to give themselves anything to look forward to. That's how the Champions League tends to greet newcomers - it chews them up, spits them out, and pays them handsomely for the privilege. It is a corrupting influence on English football and other domestic leagues, but the annoying thing is that you have to play by its rules to ever stand a chance. At least they have a manager who realises it. </p> <p>'The real priority is the Premiership and ensuring we are in Europe again next season,' the far from naive O'Leary said. 'It's not the time to panic or bring in players I don't particularly want. If we go out of the Champions League it won't be the end of the world.'</p>",

      "byline": "BC Pires",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the United States July 4th means Independence Day. November 5th in Britain is Guy Fawkes Day. July 14th to a Parisian means the storming of the Bastille. For the people of Trinidad and Tobago, two events carry enough significance to be remembered by their dates alone. Trinidadians speak of 'July 27th' and 'November 19th' in hushed tones. Not even 'the 51', the West Indies cricket team's lowest Test score (against Australia in 1998) is accorded that respectful dread. </p> <p>On 27 July, 1990, the self-styled Imam Yasin Abu Bakr led 113 young black Muslims in an armed uprising that killed two dozen. The insurrectionists firebombed police headquarters, stormed the Parliament building and the only television station at the time, took the prime minister, members of Parliament and journalists hostage and precipitated a six-day crisis that paralysed the nation in a state of emergency and caused \u00a36 million of damage to public buildings and twice that to private property. </p> <p>And, on 19 November the year before, the national football team, needing only a home draw to qualify for the 1990 World Cup finals, were knocked out of the competition by the US by a single goal. In a dangerously overcrowded National Stadium, 30,000 calypso-singing, jumping, wildly cheering spectators clad in red were stunned into a silence from which they are only now emerging. Ten years later, it is difficult to say which event traumatised the nation more. </p> <p>Certainly Trinidad and Tobago foot ball seems to have recovered better than the nation itself. This year, scoring 13 goals and conceding none (and that without Shaka Hislop in the net), Trinidad and Tobago needed only four of their first six matches to qualify for the second round of the 2002 World Cup. Mexico, the leading team in the group on paper, have had the best performance against T &amp; T so far, going down by only 1-0. Canada lost by two at home and twice that many in Port of Spain; and, the day before the West Indies cricket team lost the Test series 3-1 to England at the Kennington Oval, Trinidad and Tobago's football team hit Panama for six at the Queen's Park Oval. </p> <p>Team spirit, under new coach Ian Porterfield, is so high that it is unlikely the now available Hislop will replace his substitute, Clayton Ince, in the next round, and perhaps not at all. Dwight Yorke left Aston Villa saying that, since he would probably never play in the World Cup for his country, he would have to consider Manchester United his personal summit. He looks likely to be eating his words in Japan. </p> <p>Yorke's rise is counterpoised by his friend (and former under-14 national football team colleague) Brian Lara's slow sinking from excellence under the overwhelming weight of a mediocre cricket team. Yorke is not a greater footballer than Lara is a cricketer; but fortune favours the lucky and the man who holds the two highest batting world records finds himself in a sport that is, at the moment, simply not as striking. </p> <p>The Queen's Park Oval was sold out for the games against Panama and Canada. Not even one-day cricket, with ticket prices half those of the football games, achieves that regularly any more. The one Test match played in Trinidad this year (against Zimbabwe, a game the West Indies very nearly lost) attracted crowds sparse enough to embarrass a secondary schools league final. </p> <p>In international prestige, which matters more than anything else to the West Indian, who scorns percolated Blue Mountain coffee for Nescafe instant, individual island football has whipped West Indies cricket. Jamaica captured the hearts of the world (if not a single point) when the Reggae Boyz got to the first round in France in 1998. The president of Concacaf (North and Central American Continental Football Federation), Austin 'Jack' Warner, is from Trinidad and even the most sceptical of his critics was impressed by seeing Kevin Keegan and Franz Beckenbauer each giving coaching sessions in Trinidad to try to win votes for his respective country's 2006 World Cup bid. </p> <p>The nation has not done as well, spiritually or materially, as the football team. The Muslim rebels were released from prison by a local judge and, by the time Trinidad and Tobago's highest court of appeal, the Privy Council, sitting at 11 Downing Street, eventually ruled that the rebels ought not to have been let go, they felt it would not be fair to re-arrest them. The law-abiding citizens of Trinidad and Tobago thus had to come to terms with watching the 114 men they saw shoot up the place on television get out of jail free. Two years ago, another local judge held that the Muslim rebels were entitled to compensation for a Muslim school and supermarket burned down by policemen out of vengeance. </p> <p>Politically, the ten years between 1990 and today have torn the nation's soul. The judiciary is in open conflict with a government led by a lifelong Marxist who now plays golf with the business elite he five years ago labelled 'the parasitic oligarchy'. The prime minister's heir apparent, the present attorney-general and the former president of the T &amp; T Human Rights Bureau, somehow squares his moral conviction against the death penalty with the direct personal supervision of the hanging of nine men in a single weekend. </p> <p>Apart from having a local girl named Miss Universe in 1998, Trinidad and Tobago has had little to celebrate in the last decade, particularly from West Indies cricket. The territory had only one player on the team last year and, when Brian Lara relinquished the captaincy, there was no Trinidadian at all.

      "bodyText": "In the United States July 4th means Independence Day. November 5th in Britain is Guy Fawkes Day. July 14th to a Parisian means the storming of the Bastille. For the people of Trinidad and Tobago, two events carry enough significance to be remembered by their dates alone. Trinidadians speak of 'July 27th' and 'November 19th' in hushed tones. Not even 'the 51', the West Indies cricket team's lowest Test score (against Australia in 1998) is accorded that respectful dread. On 27 July, 1990, the self-styled Imam Yasin Abu Bakr led 113 young black Muslims in an armed uprising that killed two dozen. The insurrectionists firebombed police headquarters, stormed the Parliament building and the only television station at the time, took the prime minister, members of Parliament and journalists hostage and precipitated a six-day crisis that paralysed the nation in a state of emergency and caused \u00a36 million of damage to public buildings and twice that to private property. And, on 19 November the year before, the national football team, needing only a home draw to qualify for the 1990 World Cup finals, were knocked out of the competition by the US by a single goal. In a dangerously overcrowded National Stadium, 30,000 calypso-singing, jumping, wildly cheering spectators clad in red were stunned into a silence from which they are only now emerging. Ten years later, it is difficult to say which event traumatised the nation more. Certainly Trinidad and Tobago foot ball seems to have recovered better than the nation itself. This year, scoring 13 goals and conceding none (and that without Shaka Hislop in the net), Trinidad and Tobago needed only four of their first six matches to qualify for the second round of the 2002 World Cup. Mexico, the leading team in the group on paper, have had the best performance against T &amp; T so far, going down by only 1-0. Canada lost by two at home and twice that many in Port of Spain; and, the day before the West Indies cricket team lost the Test series 3-1 to England at the Kennington Oval, Trinidad and Tobago's football team hit Panama for six at the Queen's Park Oval. Team spirit, under new coach Ian Porterfield, is so high that it is unlikely the now available Hislop will replace his substitute, Clayton Ince, in the next round, and perhaps not at all. Dwight Yorke left Aston Villa saying that, since he would probably never play in the World Cup for his country, he would have to consider Manchester United his personal summit. He looks likely to be eating his words in Japan. Yorke's rise is counterpoised by his friend (and former under-14 national football team colleague) Brian Lara's slow sinking from excellence under the overwhelming weight of a mediocre cricket team. Yorke is not a greater footballer than Lara is a cricketer; but fortune favours the lucky and the man who holds the two highest batting world records finds himself in a sport that is, at the moment, simply not as striking. The Queen's Park Oval was sold out for the games against Panama and Canada. Not even one-day cricket, with ticket prices half those of the football games, achieves that regularly any more. The one Test match played in Trinidad this year (against Zimbabwe, a game the West Indies very nearly lost) attracted crowds sparse enough to embarrass a secondary schools league final. In international prestige, which matters more than anything else to the West Indian, who scorns percolated Blue Mountain coffee for Nescafe instant, individual island football has whipped West Indies cricket. Jamaica captured the hearts of the world (if not a single point) when the Reggae Boyz got to the first round in France in 1998. The president of Concacaf (North and Central American Continental Football Federation), Austin 'Jack' Warner, is from Trinidad and even the most sceptical of his critics was impressed by seeing Kevin Keegan and Franz Beckenbauer each giving coaching sessions in Trinidad to try to win votes for his respective country's 2006 World Cup bid. The nation has not done as well, spiritually or materially, as the football team. The Muslim rebels were released from prison by a local judge and, by the time Trinidad and Tobago's highest court of appeal, the Privy Council, sitting at 11 Downing Street, eventually ruled that the rebels ought not to have been let go, they felt it would not be fair to re-arrest them. The law-abiding citizens of Trinidad and Tobago thus had to come to terms with watching the 114 men they saw shoot up the place on television get out of jail free. Two years ago, another local judge held that the Muslim rebels were entitled to compensation for a Muslim school and supermarket burned down by policemen out of vengeance. Politically, the ten years between 1990 and today have torn the nation's soul. The judiciary is in open conflict with a government led by a lifelong Marxist who now plays golf with the business elite he five years ago labelled 'the parasitic oligarchy'. The prime minister's heir apparent, the present attorney-general and the former president of the T &amp; T Human Rights Bureau, somehow squares his moral conviction against the death penalty with the direct personal supervision of the hanging of nine men in a single weekend. Apart from having a local girl named Miss Universe in 1998, Trinidad and Tobago has had little to celebrate in the last decade, particularly from West Indies cricket. The territory had only one player on the team last year and, when Brian Lara relinquished the captaincy, there was no Trinidadian at all. The economy is growing but so are the ranks of the poor, with nearly 40 per cent of the population living below the United Nations poverty line measured at the earning rate of one American dollar a day. Like everywhere else in the world, in Port of Spain, the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting children. Hope of short-term glory lies with football, where the petty inter-island rivalry that devastates West Indies cricket is, somehow, not a factor. Trinidad and Tobago supported Jamaica in the last World Cup and, should only Trinidad and Tobago qualify this time around, Jamaicans are sure to cheer the Soca Boyz ahead of the teams West Indians generally support, Brazil and Argentina. Ten years ago, when qualification for the World Cup finals was more likely, and seven days before the last match itself, the government of the day threw a week-long celebration called Red Week without a hint of irony. Immediately before kick-off, the players were taken on a motorcade from one end of the island to the other and displayed to the adoring masses in an orchestrated demonstration of spontaneous appreciation that would have made Stalin jealous. The result of that premature frenzied festivity was 1-0 to the US, and the silence of the shell-shocked for a decade. Today, though they are quick to cheer each success of the World Cup team so far, Trinidadians and Tobagonians are slow to be talking about Japan 2002 the way they did about Italy 1990. There may be several red-letter days ahead but there will be no Red Week. The events of November 19th and July 27th are inextricably tied up in the minds and hearts of the people of Trinidad and Tobago; indeed, the national team were actually playing an international match when the Muslim rebels set off the first bombs of their coup attempt.

Now it seems the Twin Towers may well be preserved after all - but by Rugby League in Cheshire, not football in north-west London. </p> <p>Wembley are close to an agreement with Halton Borough Council which would lead to the Twin Towers being moved, piece by piece, to become the centrepiece of the proposed new national rugby league museum in Widnes. If it comes off, the decidedly delicate operation will cost around \u00a33 million but Wembley will only see a measly \u00a32 of that. </p> <p>'We always said that if anybody was serious about giving the Twin Towers a good home, and could find a way round the huge logistical difficulties involved in moving them, we would give them to them', said Chris Palmer, Wembley's communications director. 'If this deal happens, we will sell the Towers for \u00a31 each.' </p> <p>Until now it had been thought that the old stadium's signature would crumble if anyone tried to move it, as the white towers are three-sided and have no back. Halton Council proposes to get round that by only removing the tops of the towers, which are four-sided, rather than the whole structures. They would then be broken down into chunks, moved gingerly up to a site beside the Runcorn Bridge and reassembled. </p> <p>Over the last year all sorts of ideas have surfaced to save the famous towers. Various reports had them going to the Nationwide Building Society's HQ in Swindon, joining a theme park in Skegness or becoming part of a Mohamed Al Fayed-funded new bridge over the Thames. Now they are '60-40 likely' to end up by the Mersey instead. It is the only practical preservation scheme that has been mooted. And if it fails, they will be reduced to a pile of rubble - just like the rest of the old place. </p> <p>Halton Council will have to move fast. The only events planned for Wembley after England v Germany on 7 October are a series of charity and paid-for games on the famous turf until 23 October. After that the pitch will be dug up and demolition of the stadium itself starts on 6 November at the tunnel end. </p> <p>The sale of seats and other memorabilia will raise \u00a32m towards the \u00a3600m costs of the new Wembley, while 30,000 lucky winners of charity auctions or raffles will each receive a one foot square piece of turf, courtesy of Securicor, in a pizza box-style commemorative container. Only the centre spot is being retained; it will be kept safe and replanted when the new turf is being laid. </p> <p>Demolition will involve two wrecking crews, each using a huge mechanical demolisher with jaws to 'bite' chunks out of Wembley until it is gone. </p> <p>Then, as the stands and old terracing disappears, the contractors will also dig down 30 metres to accommodate the foundations of the new stadium, which will be huge, dwarfing the familiar lines of its predecessor. </p> <p>When it is finished, fans will be stag gered by the scale of it. It will be twice as high as the Empire Stadium, and much wider. It will also boast an arch - its new motif and answer to the towers - which, at 135 metres tall, is almost 100m higher than the flags on top of those towers. It will be so huge that the enormous London Eye wheel on the South Bank could fit through it. 'The twin towers would look like pepperpots set in front of the arch. That gives you some idea of the different scale of the new building to the old', explains Palmer. </p> <p>Given Wembley's hilltop location, the arch will be visible from up to 20 miles away, especially when it is lit up, as it will be during an evening game. It will act as a beacon, or signpost, for fans converging on the new Wembley, such as those coming off the M1. One idea being toyed with is shooting a bolt of white light across it when England score, yellow for Brazil and so on. The arch will also serve a practical purpose: holding up the 7,000-tonne roof, rather like a suspension bridge. </p> <p>Although demolition will continue until March 2002, the new stadium will start rising behind the wrecking crews as soon as they have moved on. The new pitch should be laid in summer 2003. Unlike the turf in Cardiff's Millennium Stadium, which slides in and out in strips, Wembley's will be permanent. Wembley National Stadium Limited, the Football Association-owned company behind the redevelopment, opted for a sliding roof, so that the grass can get as much direct sunlight as possible. </p> <p>WNSL say the new national stadium will have got rid of one of the many frustrations of the existing place: the shadow which covers a sizeable chunk of the pitch during the Cup Final - a major irritation, especially for television viewers. When Wembley reopens, only a small area around the corner flags should be in shade. </p> <p>Wembley's other fan-unfriendly drawbacks should also become ancient history. The new stadium will have 1,985 toilets instead of the existing 361. Those annoying half-time queues will be much shorter, so the need to relieve yourself behind one of the Portakabins should become much less urgent. There will be 478 catering outlets compared to the current 152. </p> <p>What about seats, another of the decrepit old stadium's disadvantages? There will be 90,000 - 12,000 more than at present - and fans are promised 30 per cent more 'personal space' in their seat. That should mean you can stretch your legs out in front of you and not have to tuck them under your backside. In theory, no more leg cramp. </p> <p>WNSL deny that the shiny new Wembley will be more for corporate customers than ordinary fans, but admit that only 76,400 of the 90,000 seats will be available to the latter. The others are divided up between corporate seats (4,000), club seats (6,000, sold as season tickets and likely to be hugely expensive), boxes (1,800), sponsors (1,000), VIPs (400) and the media (400). Expect a big row about all that. </p> <p>The hoped-for grand unveiling of the new Wembley with the 2003 Cup Final has now been abandoned. Instead Wembley will reopen with a schoolboy international in early 2004 to dry-run the facilities and then, hopefully, the 2004 Cup Final. </p> <p>denis.campbell@observer.co.uk</p>",

Japan and South Korea will not disappoint when, for the first time, the World Cup finals are held in Asia.

And although Westerners often visit the capital cities, outside Tokyo and Seoul foreigners are not seen in their thousands. </p> <p>You'll need a mountain of cash, a phrase book, a good supply of rainwear ... and your own binbag might come in handy. But don't be put off. The nightlife in Tokyo alone will make your trip well worthwhile. </p> <p>For most fans, the biggest problem will be the cost of their stay. Hotels are expensive, and you can guarantee that rates will be hiked for the World Cup. Unlike elsewhere, rates seem to be governed more by square footage of the room than by the facilities provided. A basic tiny room with an en suite bath will cost a minimum of \u00a380 per night in downtown Tokyo, and Korean prices are similar. If you step into a taxi you'll be \u00a310 worse off before you start moving, so travelling alone will be particularly costly. </p> <p>Travelling about Japan is easy but also expensive. Bullet trains flash between all the major cities at speeds of up to 200 miles an hour, but a two-hour journey will cost about \u00a3150. Pricey, but the trains run on time and there are no leaves on the line. </p> <p>And make sure you bring plenty of cash, because in Tokyo there are only two cashpoints that accept western credit cards and finding them can be a nightmare. The Japanese simply do not believe in plastic, only cash. To compound your frustration, should you run out of money and want to phone home for help, you won't be able to use your English mobile phone because both Korea and Japan use different frequencies from the rest of the world. </p> <p>Japanese and Koreans are naturally reserved by nature, and there's not much of a pre-match drinking culture. If hordes of fans have a drink and it starts to get rowdy, steer clear of the Korean riot squad: they are all trained to at least third dan in taekwondo. </p> <p>The people are extremely friendly and respectful, and they expect the same courteous behaviour in return. Bowing is the normal greeting in both countries. And should you exchange a business card in Korea don't take it out of your back pocket, as it's seen as a disrespectful gesture. </p> <p>English is spoken by some in Tokyo, but out in the provinces it is very rare, so have a crash course if you can before travelling and don't forget your phrase book. The international language of football should pull you through though, because the Japanese and Koreans are football mad. The Premier League is extremely popular - with games being beamed live three or more days a week - as are the Champions League, Serie A and the FA Cup. It's just about impossible to stroll round Tokyo or Seoul without seeing a picture of David Beckham or Michael Owen. </p> <p>The games will kick off at 3.30pm and 8pm local time and the tournament is being played throughout June, slap-bang in the middle of the rainy season. This is not the drizzle you get in England and Scotland, but a daily deluge that lasts for two to three hours and will leave you thoroughly soaked if you're caught in the middle of it. Come prepared. </p> <p>The stadiums have been built specifically for the World Cup, and those in Japan are all virtually finished already, two years before the event begins. The Koreans are embarrassingly behind schedule: they hate to be outdone by their co-hosts. </p> <p>The atmosphere inside the grounds should be superb, especially when Japan or Korea play. You'll be surprised by the number of women at the games, and if you didn't encounter any of the visiting Japanese and Korean fans at France 98 - three generations of the same family would often be at a match - you'll also be amazed by their polite nature. In France, the Japanese fans gave their players a tickertape entrance at the start of the games, and when the match was over produced black plastic bin liners and cleared away the mess themselves. That sort of thing is not unusual. </p> <p>Enjoy the experience, enjoy the culture.

      "body": "<p>The only public transport along the Whanganui River Road is the early morning mail bus, which takes four hours to rattle its way up river from the town of Wanganui to the remote settlement of Pipiriki. Even by New Zealand standards, this part of the country - deep in the heart of the North Island - is the back of beyond. </p> <p>The New Zealand postal service chooses to contract out the deliveries for geographically challenged regions like this, and the operators call the return trip a 'rural mail tour'. This seemed a good way to see a bit of the back-country - and I've got form in the delivery game - a stint as a Christmas relief postman in Huddersfield. </p> <p>We were on the road at 7.15am. By 7.18am, as the only passenger that day, I was promoted to folding up the advertising circulars that were being delivered with the post. The 76 addresses on the 79-kilometre route were all getting missives from the Warehouse ('where everyone gets a bargain'), Woolworths ('the fresh food people') and the Wanganui Chronicle (sample front-page headline: 'Man Drops Plate on High Street'). </p> <p>The deliveries come in ones and twos as the narrow road winds high above the east bank of the Whanganui River, through a dense carpeting of trees and bushes. Occasional clearings offer dramatic views down to steep-sided, fern-clad gorges or across the river to sheep paddocks swirled with mist. </p> <p>Every house has a mailbox by the side of the road. Some people make do with simple wooden boxes on poles; at one house, there is nothing more than an inverted plastic bucket. At the other extreme are huge contraptions with handles and windows - one, I swear, had a veranda and a barbecue. </p> <p>I was puzzled by the few boxes that didn't seem to have houses attached to them - until distant buildings, far across the river, were pointed out. There's no road access at all on the other side, so the inhabitants have to cross on flimsy-looking aerial cableways strung 100ft above the river to retrieve their mail. The full significance of this only becomes apparent later. </p> <p>We make slow progress on the round, especially in the later stages where the last 20 kilometres of the road are gravel only. But it's an improvement on the old days, when access to the string of upriver settlements was by paddle steamer only. The first regular service started in 1891, prompting an early tourism boom which saw Edwardian visitors being steamed up the river to spend the night at the grand Pipiriki Hotel (long since burnt down). </p> <p>But the Europeans were late arrivals. This has been Maori land since at least the fourteenth century, and the small settlements along the river are still overwhelmingly Maori in character. Not that you'd know from the names of the hamlets, which were nearly all rechristened by European missionaries who pushed up the valley in the 1840s, each clutching a Bible in one hand and a volume of the Classics in the other. Hence Jerusalem, Corinth and Athens. </p> <p>At Jerusalem, the prettiest place by far, the Sisters of Compassion maintain the historic church of St Joseph's, perched on a bluff above a bend in the river. We've got time to get out and have a look at the carved Maori altar inside the church. Halfway through the morning you might even be offered a cup of tea at someone's house. </p> <p>Eventually, at around 11am, the van rolls into Pipiriki, focus of an increasing number of river-based activities. Most local businesses work together and if you want to arrange a jet-boat trip, a half-day in a kayak on the river or a farm stay in conjunction with the mail-bus ride, it's easily done. </p> <p>The most popular trip is the jet-boat ride and hike to the Bridge to Nowhere, a remote concrete span across a deep valley, which the government thought that returning First World War soldiers might like to farm. What the government failed to mention was an absence of flat fields and, instead, an abundance of hills and impenetrable bush. A few hardy types stuck it out, battling to clear the trees to provide grazing land, but by 1936, when the bridge was built to ease access, most settlers had abandoned the valley. </p> <p>Back at Pipiriki, someone's waiting to take me to my overnight accommodation. I'm staying at The Flying Fox, downriver near Corinth, which sounds suitably rural and indeed is - but it's on the opposite bank. It turns out that, round here, a flying fox is not a bat but the local term for an aerial cableway. In my book hotels and guest houses should have a drive big enough to accommodate my limousine, not a bit of old wire strung between two poles, from which dangles a rudimentary cage with a bench - one that swings in the wind. I still shudder at the thought of the bicycle pedals set into the floor, 'for when the power fails'. </p> <p>Be brave though, for Fox hosts Annette and John have fashioned two stylish guest cottages from rescued material in the middle of a thriving organic farmstead. Think Gilligan's Island meets Swiss Family Robinson and you won't be far off. The two-storey wood and tin cottages have wrap-around decks and first-floor balconies, are warmed by wood-burning stoves and decorated in a sort of rustic-pueblo style. </p> <p>Ingredients for meals come from the garden. Avocados are a big crop and the cottages are shaded by a grove of walnut trees. John even catches eels from the river, which are smoked and served as an appetiser. Best of all is bath time: grab a glass of Chardonnay and sink into the outdoor clawfoot tub beneath the southern sky, the water warmed by a wood fire. In the morning, home-baked bread, yoghurt and local honey is delivered to your room and if you're up early enough you'll hear the toot of the horn as the mail bus goes by on the other side of the river. Just don't volunteer to fetch the letters.</p> <p><strong>Getting there </strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.airnewzealand.com\">Air New Zealand</a> (020 8741 2299) flies daily from Heathrow to Auckland via Los Angeles from \u00a3700 The October fare is \u00a31,047.

At the other extreme are huge contraptions with handles and windows - one, I swear, had a veranda and a barbecue. I was puzzled by the few boxes that didn't seem to have houses attached to them - until distant buildings, far across the river, were pointed out. There's no road access at all on the other side, so the inhabitants have to cross on flimsy-looking aerial cableways strung 100ft above the river to retrieve their mail. The full significance of this only becomes apparent later. We make slow progress on the round, especially in the later stages where the last 20 kilometres of the road are gravel only. But it's an improvement on the old days, when access to the string of upriver settlements was by paddle steamer only. The first regular service started in 1891, prompting an early tourism boom which saw Edwardian visitors being steamed up the river to spend the night at the grand Pipiriki Hotel (long since burnt down). But the Europeans were late arrivals. This has been Maori land since at least the fourteenth century, and the small settlements along the river are still overwhelmingly Maori in character. Not that you'd know from the names of the hamlets, which were nearly all rechristened by European missionaries who pushed up the valley in the 1840s, each clutching a Bible in one hand and a volume of the Classics in the other. Hence Jerusalem, Corinth and Athens. At Jerusalem, the prettiest place by far, the Sisters of Compassion maintain the historic church of St Joseph's, perched on a bluff above a bend in the river. We've got time to get out and have a look at the carved Maori altar inside the church. Halfway through the morning you might even be offered a cup of tea at someone's house. Eventually, at around 11am, the van rolls into Pipiriki, focus of an increasing number of river-based activities. Most local businesses work together and if you want to arrange a jet-boat trip, a half-day in a kayak on the river or a farm stay in conjunction with the mail-bus ride, it's easily done. The most popular trip is the jet-boat ride and hike to the Bridge to Nowhere, a remote concrete span across a deep valley, which the government thought that returning First World War soldiers might like to farm. What the government failed to mention was an absence of flat fields and, instead, an abundance of hills and impenetrable bush. A few hardy types stuck it out, battling to clear the trees to provide grazing land, but by 1936, when the bridge was built to ease access, most settlers had abandoned the valley. Back at Pipiriki, someone's waiting to take me to my overnight accommodation. I'm staying at The Flying Fox, downriver near Corinth, which sounds suitably rural and indeed is - but it's on the opposite bank. It turns out that, round here, a flying fox is not a bat but the local term for an aerial cableway. In my book hotels and guest houses should have a drive big enough to accommodate my limousine, not a bit of old wire strung between two poles, from which dangles a rudimentary cage with a bench - one that swings in the wind. I still shudder at the thought of the bicycle pedals set into the floor, 'for when the power fails'. Be brave though, for Fox hosts Annette and John have fashioned two stylish guest cottages from rescued material in the middle of a thriving organic farmstead. Think Gilligan's Island meets Swiss Family Robinson and you won't be far off. The two-storey wood and tin cottages have wrap-around decks and first-floor balconies, are warmed by wood-burning stoves and decorated in a sort of rustic-pueblo style. Ingredients for meals come from the garden. Avocados are a big crop and the cottages are shaded by a grove of walnut trees. John even catches eels from the river, which are smoked and served as an appetiser. Best of all is bath time: grab a glass of Chardonnay and sink into the outdoor clawfoot tub beneath the southern sky, the water warmed by a wood fire. In the morning, home-baked bread, yoghurt and local honey is delivered to your room and if you're up early enough you'll hear the toot of the horn as the mail bus goes by on the other side of the river. Just don't volunteer to fetch the letters. Getting there Air New Zealand (020 8741 2299) flies daily from Heathrow to Auckland via Los Angeles from \u00a3700 The October fare is \u00a31,047.

      "body": "<p> It was at the citadel that we first heard the famous muezzin of Aleppo. High above the city, over a light meal of spiced sweetmeats and grape juice, the afternoon call to prayer bubbled up, slowly at first, from unseen singers in the countless minarets sprinkled across the skyline by one or other Islamic dynasty since the eighth century. </p> <p>Our guide, Mohammed, had explained how you could tell the ages of the mosques from the shapes of their minarets. The earliest Islamic rulers, the Omayyads, built their minarets like giant church towers, to rival their sister religion in height and splendour; the Mamluks and Seljuks went for more bulbous affairs before the Turkish Ottomans settled on the pointed pencils that have provided the model for the minaret ever since. </p> <p>Now, one by one, these minarets were coming to life, the cries of the individual singers gathering into a mournful roar engulfing the city. And finally, as if he was waiting until last, our own muezzin began to sing Allahu Akhbar, God is Great, from the highest tower in the city directly above our heads. </p> <p>Someone in our party said: 'That was better than the eclipse', and it did feel like a once in a lifetime experience. But here this happens five times a day: our special moment was just the third in a series. </p> <p>Somehow, the quotidian nature of the call to prayer takes away none of its magic. And in Aleppo, a centre of ancient and modern Arabic music, they are proud of their muezzin. Here you have none of the usual lazy, muffled recordings played through loudspeakers you find elsewhere in the Muslim world. Here, the muezzin compete. </p> <p>Aleppo is the most Mediterranean of Syrian cities. In the North-west near the Turkish border, it has been the traditional meeting point of Arab and European traders for centuries. It retains its mongrel charm. Even the citadel itself is the result of Christian-Muslim architectural inbreeding. It is a vast construction from the period of the Mamluks, rulers of Egyptian origin who finally drove out the Crusaders in the thirteenth century. But the influence of the Christian invaders remains in the way the Mamluks' own strongholds look like Crusader castles. Built inside a vast moat with a high-arched, stone entrance, Aleppo citadel is the finest example of this strange hybrid style. </p> <p>Syria is finally opening up to the West, and there are high hopes for the new President Bashar, son of the late dictator Hafez al-Assad, who ruled the country for almost three decades. The Foreign Office was already making overtures to the president-in-waiting on behalf of British business before the death of the 'Lion of Damascus' last June. British Mediterranean Airways has opened a new route to Aleppo, a canny move as the northern city is the perfect introduction to the country, away from the heavy, pre-Cold War atmosphere of Damascus. </p> <p>With a good guide, a bit of planning and a strong constitution it is possible to see most of Syria's main tourist sites in a week. We travelled to Damascus; deep into the desert to the Roman ruins at Palmyra; and visited the Crusader castle Krak des Chevaliers, near the Lebanese border, and the ancient Christian village of Maalula, where the people still speak Aramaic, the language of Christ. </p> <p> It would be quite possible to spend a whole week in Aleppo alone and several days in the souk, which remains the soul of this trading city. Because of the Syrian government's boycott of companies that trade with Israel - such as Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Motorola - most of the products here come from the Arab world, or the Far East. Each sector of the market specialises in a particular product: spices, carpets, fabrics, dyes, silver, gold and even wedding gear. If it weren't for the odd photograph of Diana, Princess of Wales, (a particular favourite of the traders) in Arab headdress, it could almost be 100 years ago. </p> <p>On the edge of the souk at the entrance to the Great Mosque, we bumped into Sebastien, a carpet dealer with a good stock of Oscar Wilde witticisms and chat-up lines rendered in camp Soho English. Paul Theroux and Robert Tewdwr Moss have both written about these pretty-boys who claim to have learnt their English from travellers picked up in the souk. </p> <p>After asking me whether I had discovered myself 'in the darkness or in the light', Sebastien told me that 'the first time you will cry, the next time you will knock on my door'. He then tried to sell me an expensive carpet, so I decided this was an elaborate sales pitch. I made my excuse and left. </p> <p>My favourite approach came from Mouffak, the owner of a fancy goods emporium, who came up with the highly original line: 'If you come and see my shop, I'll show you my synagogue.' In a country where the Jewish community has dwindled to a few hundred this was an offer not to be refused. </p> <p>Until the foundation of the modern Israeli state there was a thriving Jewish community in Aleppo and the rest of Syria. Early Christianity, the most successful Jewish sect of all, made its first tentative moves towards the Gentile in cities that are now in Syria. It is easy to forget that Damascus and Jerusalem are equidistant from the Sea of Galilee and that both were under Roman rule during that early Christian period. </p> <p>There are churches everywhere in Aleppo and Damascus, and in Syria Christianity is recognised as the country's second religion. The Jews, however, have been systematically driven out, but, here and there, synagogues remain. </p> <p>Mouffak's synagogue was around the corner from his shop selling 'objets d'art' under the shadow of the citadel. He had been given the key by the former owners before they fled the country. A silent courtyard with a single tree in the centre was surrounded by shaded walkways. Above the building was a tower with a wooden gallery like a squat mini- minaret. For all the world it looked like a small, primitive mosque, but Mouffak took me to the far wall, and there, sure enough, was a short prayer carved in Hebrew. </p> <p>It is now accepted by some scholars of Islamic architecture that the basic design of the mosque is itself a hybrid: half church, half synagogue, and here, deserted in the middle of Aleppo, is proof of the umbilical link between Judaism and Islam in the form of its holiest buildings. </p> <p>In the national museum in Damascus, there is further evidence of this link. Just after the First World War, a British soldier chanced on the almost fully preserved remains of a second-century synagogue at Dura Europos near the River Euphrates in the eastern desert. This extraordinary building has been transferred in its entirety to the museum, an ironic symbol of the religious diversity of the past. </p> <p>On the walls of the synagogue are painted scenes from the Bible, lovingly executed in bright reds and yellows. The binding of Isaac, Moses and the basket and the story of Esther are all there, as well as one scene apparently from the life of Christ, suggesting that the synagogue could even have been used by an early Judaeo-Christian sect. </p> <p>It is a strange exhibit at the heart of Syria's main state museum, and another reminder of the tragic legacy of the Assad regime. </p> <p>Such reminders are everywhere you go in Syria. One example is carried in the pockets of every one of the country's citizens. The Syrian \u00a350 note bears the picture of a medieval wooden water wheel from the city of Hama, in the centre of the country. It is one of 17 'norias' from the Mamluk and Ottoman periods that still draw water from the River Orontes to irrigate the fields around Hama. </p> <p>But for anyone who knows a little of Syria's recent history there is something sinister about having these wheels on what is probably the country's widest circulation banknote, which is worth about 70 pence, the price of a bottle of the local beer. In 1982 Assad sent his troops into Hama, stronghold of the opposition Islamists, the Muslim Brotherhood. They bombarded the city for a week, razing some quarters to the ground. Up to 40,000 people are estimated to have died in the slaughter that followed. Most had no connection with the Islamists. </p> <p> As our coach passed Hama, Mohammed, our Ministry of Tourism guide, gave the government line: 'We used to have a problem with fundamentalists in Syria. Now we don't have a problem.' </p> <p>The Roman ruins at Palmyra pose a similar difficulty. A three-hour coach ride brings you to this oasis in the middle of the desert, which was once a key staging post for caravans travelling to and from the Mediterranean. The city is dominated by the gargantuan temple of Baal, the great pagan god that pre-dated and, here, survived the monotheistic revolution. Like Hama, Palmyra is used by the regime as a symbol of Syria's links with the past and, as such, a guarantee of its legitimacy. The ruins are therefore often used as the backdrop to music festivals marking national holidays and beamed to every living room in the land. </p> <p>Palmyra, isolated in the desert, is also the site of Syria's most notorious high security prison, where opponents of the regime are left to rot awaiting execution. </p> <p>In one shameful episode after one of the regular attempts on Assad's life, the dictator ordered troops into the prison, where they opened fire on the unarmed, helpless Islamists inside. </p> <p>Syria is a fascinating country, but it has been run for 30 years by a shockingly brutal regime, which has killed and imprisoned thousands of its people to maintain a tiny \u00e9lite in power. President Bashar may be a reformer, but he is still dependent on senior members of the tiny Shia Alawi sect to maintain his rule. It would be hypocritical to counsel against visiting Syria, which has some of the most extraordinary - and, as yet, largely unspoilt - tourist attractions in the Middle East. Every now and again, though, somewhere like Hama reminds you that it is ruled by one of the most oppressive regimes on earth.</p> <p><strong>Getting there </strong></p> <p>Martin Bright flew with <a href=\"http://www.britishairways.com\">British Mediterranean Airways</a>.

A silent courtyard with a single tree in the centre was surrounded by shaded walkways. Above the building was a tower with a wooden gallery like a squat mini- minaret. For all the world it looked like a small, primitive mosque, but Mouffak took me to the far wall, and there, sure enough, was a short prayer carved in Hebrew. It is now accepted by some scholars of Islamic architecture that the basic design of the mosque is itself a hybrid: half church, half synagogue, and here, deserted in the middle of Aleppo, is proof of the umbilical link between Judaism and Islam in the form of its holiest buildings. In the national museum in Damascus, there is further evidence of this link. Just after the First World War, a British soldier chanced on the almost fully preserved remains of a second-century synagogue at Dura Europos near the River Euphrates in the eastern desert. This extraordinary building has been transferred in its entirety to the museum, an ironic symbol of the religious diversity of the past. On the walls of the synagogue are painted scenes from the Bible, lovingly executed in bright reds and yellows. The binding of Isaac, Moses and the basket and the story of Esther are all there, as well as one scene apparently from the life of Christ, suggesting that the synagogue could even have been used by an early Judaeo-Christian sect. It is a strange exhibit at the heart of Syria's main state museum, and another reminder of the tragic legacy of the Assad regime. Such reminders are everywhere you go in Syria. One example is carried in the pockets of every one of the country's citizens. The Syrian \u00a350 note bears the picture of a medieval wooden water wheel from the city of Hama, in the centre of the country. It is one of 17 'norias' from the Mamluk and Ottoman periods that still draw water from the River Orontes to irrigate the fields around Hama. But for anyone who knows a little of Syria's recent history there is something sinister about having these wheels on what is probably the country's widest circulation banknote, which is worth about 70 pence, the price of a bottle of the local beer. In 1982 Assad sent his troops into Hama, stronghold of the opposition Islamists, the Muslim Brotherhood. They bombarded the city for a week, razing some quarters to the ground. Up to 40,000 people are estimated to have died in the slaughter that followed. Most had no connection with the Islamists. As our coach passed Hama, Mohammed, our Ministry of Tourism guide, gave the government line: 'We used to have a problem with fundamentalists in Syria. Now we don't have a problem.' The Roman ruins at Palmyra pose a similar difficulty. A three-hour coach ride brings you to this oasis in the middle of the desert, which was once a key staging post for caravans travelling to and from the Mediterranean. The city is dominated by the gargantuan temple of Baal, the great pagan god that pre-dated and, here, survived the monotheistic revolution. Like Hama, Palmyra is used by the regime as a symbol of Syria's links with the past and, as such, a guarantee of its legitimacy. The ruins are therefore often used as the backdrop to music festivals marking national holidays and beamed to every living room in the land. Palmyra, isolated in the desert, is also the site of Syria's most notorious high security prison, where opponents of the regime are left to rot awaiting execution. In one shameful episode after one of the regular attempts on Assad's life, the dictator ordered troops into the prison, where they opened fire on the unarmed, helpless Islamists inside. Syria is a fascinating country, but it has been run for 30 years by a shockingly brutal regime, which has killed and imprisoned thousands of its people to maintain a tiny \u00e9lite in power. President Bashar may be a reformer, but he is still dependent on senior members of the tiny Shia Alawi sect to maintain his rule. It would be hypocritical to counsel against visiting Syria, which has some of the most extraordinary - and, as yet, largely unspoilt - tourist attractions in the Middle East. Every now and again, though, somewhere like Hama reminds you that it is ruled by one of the most oppressive regimes on earth. Getting there Martin Bright flew with British Mediterranean Airways.

Lower down was an antique day bed, cut-embroidered white linen drapes and next door, a library of rare books.

Oleasters, wild olive trees some 4,500 years old, occupy the fields like twisted, pot-bellied Dickensian figures. Gouged, split and weathered over the centuries, they hardly seem capable of supporting leaves, never mind a good shaking at harvest time. But these are mere saplings. Neolithic digs at nearby Torre Canne spa, also a beach, have unearthed olive stones dating back 10,000 years. </p> <p>In the cave's farm shop all our supermarket organics were here, but I was in for a few surprises. Traditional Apulian cuisine is based on plants growing wild. As part of a 17-course lunch (yes) I had a salad of tiny orchids, a frittura of leaves, poppy flowers on cheese and roasted lampascioni - a type of sweet bulb eaten only in this region. In Tuscany, where it also grows, they'd turn their noses up. Dish after dish arrived. Just as I was thinking I might never need to eat again, there was a roll-call of 24 types of rosolio - a liqueur made with grain alcohol. You choose mulberry because by then the previous 23 are lost in a stupor induced by this formidable experience. Signora Balestrazzi is rumoured to have made fettucine with poison ivy once. </p> <p>The logistics of all this bothered me because I tend towards takeaways. Is olive oil used in all the dishes? It was daft enough to deserve a fitting response, but I didn't expect her to faint. 'Oohh!' She clutched her face, eyes closed. 'SEHHMpre!

I decided that this was the most beautiful place on earth, until I found the next one, and because all the previous ones lay concealed under layers of time and memory, for the moment. </p> <p> I found much reminiscent of the East. Apulia's geographical position points that way - from the fastidious exoticism of the food (although, as a hopeless cook, that might just be my awed impression of it) to the hypogean dwellings on rock faces and domed architecture of the trulli, said to have originated in Mycenae around 3000BC.

Spanish and Catalan culture is the theme of the 38th Belfast Festival at Queen's University, Ireland's biggest arts festival and, after Edinburgh, the second biggest in the UK. More than 100,000 people are expected to attend its multitude of events between 27 October and 12 November. </p> <p>The festival was founded in the early Six ties by a group of academics at Queen's who modelled it on Edinburgh's example. It has grown to become a vital, vibrant part of Belfast life, a chance to show off a city that does not always enjoy the best publicity. Something of a cultural beacon during the Troubles, particularly in the turbulent Seventies when even local people were reluctant to venture into the city centre, the festival has also played a significant role in the regeneration of Belfast's image. Festival time, indeed, is the perfect introduction to Belfast. 'There is,' says festival director Rosie Turner, 'a real buzz about the place.' </p> <p>It is a city which will surprise and delight those who know it only from the TV news. Those industrialists would not feel too alienated if they returned today. A Victorian grandness and solidity still begins at the magnificent City Hall and radiates outward through elegant city buildings such as the restored St George's Market and the recently extended Linen Hall Library to many suburban streets of Victorian and Edwardian terraces. But take a boat trip down the River Lagan and you see a new city emerging. That reassuring giant of Belfast life, the Harland and Wolff shipyard (where the Titanic was built), may still dominate the harbour skyline but on either side of the Lagan there are signs of new development. Where Victorian warehouses once stood, there are fashionable waterside apartments, the strikingly designed concert venue, the Waterfront Hall, and a new Hilton hotel. </p> <p>High-quality hotels are springing up at an extraordinary rate, and good restaurants, a rarity at the beginning of the Nineties, are now easily found. There are many smart new bars and chic cafes, particularly along the Lisburn Road - the Ta Tu bar and restaurant is only the smartest and latest - and along the 'Golden Mile' from Great Victoria Street, where Robinson's is a big attraction, to the university area. </p> <p>Thankfully, there are also a host of marvellous pubs little changed from Victorian days. The Crown Liquor Saloon, opposite Belfast's most famous hotel landmark, the recently expanded Europa, is surely the most beautiful Victorian pub anywhere, while White's Tavern (Belfast's oldest), the Fountain Tavern and Kelly's Cellars are also worth a visit. Traditional music sessions can also be found in two other atmospheric old pubs, the Rotterdam and the Kitchen Bar. </p> <p>About a third of Northern Ireland's 1.6 million people live in Belfast, but it rarely feels crowded, even in the busy shopping centres. The laid-back nature of the locals helps - this is a city where you're treated as a welcome visitor, not a tourist to be suffered - and many attractions are within comfortable walking distance. The city has moved on remarkably since the peace process began, though there are tours to the loyalist and republican heartlands in West Belfast. </p> <p>Belfast is also enjoying its first film festival (Cinemagic, which begins in early December) and the first phase of the Odyssey, Northern Ireland's main millennium project, opens in November. It includes a 10,000-seater sports and entertainment arena, state-of-the-art science and technology museum, an Imax cinema and a huge shopping centre. But the main event remains the festival at Queen's. </p> <p>There are a number of special festival breaks on offer (Guidelines Tourism, on 028 9146 5697, specialises in festival packages), and many hotels have special weekend rates. But a longer stay will be amply repaid. The sheer breadth and quality of the festival offerings, including leading Irish and overseas theatre, dance, comedy, classical, jazz and folk music, staged at 20 venues around the city, offer the perfect opportunity to give Belfast the attention it deserves. </p> <p><strong> Festival highlights</strong></p> <p> <strong> Compania Sara Baras Sensaciones</strong> <br> A dance journey through the different styles of the renowned all-female flamenco troupe.

      "bodyText": "The Victorian industrialists who left such an indelible mark on Belfast would probably have disapproved, but the city they helped to shape will soon be alive to flamenco and fiesta, while tapas and sangria will feature alongside the Ulster fry and Guinness in many of its restaurants and bars. Spanish and Catalan culture is the theme of the 38th Belfast Festival at Queen's University, Ireland's biggest arts festival and, after Edinburgh, the second biggest in the UK. More than 100,000 people are expected to attend its multitude of events between 27 October and 12 November. The festival was founded in the early Six ties by a group of academics at Queen's who modelled it on Edinburgh's example. It has grown to become a vital, vibrant part of Belfast life, a chance to show off a city that does not always enjoy the best publicity. Something of a cultural beacon during the Troubles, particularly in the turbulent Seventies when even local people were reluctant to venture into the city centre, the festival has also played a significant role in the regeneration of Belfast's image.

      "byline": "Harriet Lane",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Even its most dedicated fans - the people who spent last week moping, experiencing a humiliating bereavement after its pyrotechnic climax just nine days ago - will admit that Big Brother was extremely short on mystery. Here was co-ed prison life laid bare for the 24/7 CCTV generation. We saw everything, from the is-this-really-happening? (Nick's machinations, poor Thomas's erection, Caggie's Dark Night of the Soul) to the relentlessly banal (the long hours of fag-rolling, spot-popping and the apparent freeze-frame of bodies lying motionless on the lawn). And, all the time, we listened: to chats about brothels and chickens and George Michael and spiders. As the weeks ground on, the survivors realised how little they had in common, and sensible conversation dried up entirely. When we got into the final lap, those hypnotically dull dog days just before the winner was announced, it seemed that neither Anna, Craig nor Darren could think of anything more interesting to say apart from, 'Anyone for a cup of tea?' The strangest thing was that no one ever asked the most obvious question: Anna, what on earth are you doing in here? </p> <p>Anna Nolan, 'the little Irish lezzie', as Caggie affectionately called her, was different. She may have had a stint as a prison warder, an international basketball player and, most famously, a nun, but she also seemed the most normal person in a very abnormal situation. Of all the housemates, she was the one who gave least away while still managing to participate fully in the life of the house. Some people read this as malevolence. Early on, the Times 's Matthew Parris identified her as a deeply sinister presence; Nasty Nick memorably said that she was 'calculating' and 'deadly as a snake'. But the people who hoped she would walk off with the \u00a370,000 (which, by the end, she desperately wanted, to spend on a deposit for a flat) liked her because she appeared to be the only contestant who was properly equipped for life outside the house. She wasn't a show-off, like Andy, Nichola and Caggie; nor an innocent like Thomas and Darren; nor insecure like Mel and Nick; nor cardboard cutouts like Sada, Craig and Claire. No: she cracked good jokes, she exerted a calming influence on the group, and she never lost it. </p> <p>You'd want Anna on your team every time, precisely because you could rely on her not to release a trashy rave single, or do a stint as a panto villain, or become a brassiere model. Forget her canonisation as a gay icon: her appeal went much wider than that. Anna's sexuality did not define her role on what was ultimately a soap: that alone makes her a unique figure in TV history. Perhaps her greatest achievement was to play Big Brother at his own game: she joined in without selling out, or selling her soul, and she made it to the wire. </p> <p>Naturally, I voted for her (along with 3.41 million others). We saw her come second to Craig, whose 'Heart For Jo' moment provided a startlingly graceful conclusion to the whole circus; we saw her leave the house, looking uncharacteristically dazed in her characteristic get up of jeans and sneakers; and we still never got the answer to that question. Why did you do it, Anna? </p> <p>Anna, who's a month short of her thirtieth birthday, keeps her head down as she follows her recently-acquired PR person into a brasserie in Camden. Yes, she's boyish and skinny, in a long-sleeved T-shirt and jeans and Birkenstocks, just as you would have expected, but there is something different about her. Of course! She's brushed her hair! (Watching the tapes as far as week five, that was the thing that really shocked her. 'It was like two chickens at the back of my head.' She had packed a hairbrush, she says, but forgot about it until the last day.) </p> <p>She orders a gin and tonic - not bad for 2.10pm - and deftly attaches the mike of my dictaphone to her collar, though I get the impression she's a little bit nervous. Explaining why she wanted to go on the show, she says, 'I got carried away, swept along.' She'd seen the documentary about the Dutch version of Big Brother and was intrigued, so applied rather absent-mindedly. Things snowballed from there. When she got the final nod, she remembers thinking: 'Oh, I haven't even decided if I really want to do it yet.' Her long-term girlfriend, Tanya Paice, thought it was a terrible idea; so did her friends and family. 'People said, \"You've only been chosen because you're a lesbian ex-nun. Channel 4 are just going to milk that.\" And I thought, very good point.' So why did she go against everyone's advice? </p> <p>'It's so appealing, being on television 24 hours a day,' sighs Anna, with dashing irony. 'People say it was sick, it was like an attraction to something perverse, and maybe that's why I did it. But at the end of the day, the reasons why people were saying not to do it - you're a lesbian and that means you might get some bad press - didn't seem to me to be reasons to pull out. I thought I should just be a bit ballsy about it.' In other words, as a self-confident sort of person, she didn't see why her sexuality should inhibit her from having a pop at the prize. </p> <p>Anna grew up in a working-class suburb of Dublin, one of seven siblings. Her dad, Kevin, was a labourer at Guinness; her mother Eileen left school at 14, but has recently taken a degree in classical Greek, and is now studying for an MA. According to their daughter, Mr and Mrs Nolan were described in the press as 'devout Catholic parents of Anna Nolan, the lesbian ex-nun who said she'd bring a vibrator into the house.' Anna imitates her mother's reaction: 'I was disgusted! Devout Irish Catholic - how dare they!' </p> <p>While the Nolan children were growing up, every spare penny went towards their education; all the girls went to a fee-paying convent and had private music instruction. Anna did a degree in music and musical instrument technology at London Guildhall, and then drifted into a series of slackery jobs. Most recently, she was working at a skateboard shop. Eileen, a woman who has evidently got stacks of focus and ambition, is Anna's heroine. One gets the impression that the job offers that are coming her daughter's way - maybe a slot on a London radio station; maybe a presenting role on TV documentaries - may provide a longed-for chance to shift gear, professionally. </p> <p>'In the house, we talked about the link that we all had,' says Anna, taking a slug of G&amp;T, 'and it emerged that everyone wanted to change their life somehow. Because if you're basically content and happy with your job, your life, your family, you probably didn't want to go on this show. What's the point? So we were 11 people who just wanted to give ourselves a right old kick up the arse and then see what would happen. It was inspiring.' </p> <p>Not all the time, of course. Ask Anna for her abiding memory of the house, and she says, instantly, 'Waiting. Waiting for the shopping, for nominations. I was tense 70 per cent of the time. It was so hard not being in control.' All the bedroom lights were switched on, with a percussive ker-chung, at 10 every morning. Hot water was only available at a certain time; access to the store room was rigorously controlled. To viewers, Anna was the contestant who seemed to perk up most in the diary room, sensing the challenge of trying to crack Big Brother's cast-iron inscrutability. 'I had a fixation with him, yeah. When Nick left, we were all gutted - and then Big Brother gave us a video, a bar of chocolate, and we were like, \"Hey, Nick who?\" We were so fickle.' </p> <p>On Day One, she says, she was utterly intimidated. Who by? 'Darren, Sada, Nichola, Caroline. You could see their personality on the outside. And Mel, because Mel was so...' and here Anna again airs her formidable talent for impersonation, pouting and looking flirtily sideways... 'so cool.' Then she checks herself, conscious that this might be misinterpreted. She has seen Mel earlier today; later she will say that Mel and Darren are the only contestants with whom she imagines she'll stay in touch. 'I love Mel,' she says. 'All her bad press is rubbish. I feel Mel was unfairly represented.' But for more than half of the incarceration, Mel gave the impression of wanting to hang out exclusively with the men, where she was always guaranteed lots of attention, rather than attempting to make female friends. 'Early on,' says Anna, stoutly, 'Mel did pick up that there was a lot of animosity towards her from the girls' camp. Stupidly created by some girls, jealous minxes. No, I'm not telling.' </p> <p>We didn't see that on screen; Channel 4 was clearly shaping the narrative. But much of the time, the housemates (who were always aware of the tread of the technical staff behind the walls, and conscious of the electronic whine of the CCTVs) were also controlling what was broadcast. Underneath the braggadocio - the shaggy dogs involving Thai massage parlours and threesomes - few candidates talked openly and with sincerity about their love lives. Most housemates benefited from this, as the public, who picked the evictee every week, was definitely swayed by a rather nasty sort of emotional terrorism: a vengeful, rather puritanical longing to stamp on any sexual tension that threatened to flourish. (What does it say about us as a nation that we were so keen to punish Andy and Thomas for falling for Mel?) </p> <p>As far as viewers were aware, then, Anna was gay but single. The appearance of Tanya - pretty, blonde, and kind of clingy - on the final night put paid to that notion. The pair had decided in advance that it would be better if Tanya's name wasn't mentioned. Later on, Tanya had a change of heart, but by then it was too late. Hence the showy reunion. </p> <p>But it suited Anna to hold back a little. Before she went into the house, she had read an article about Bart, the winner of the Dutch competition. 'He said, even though you're exposed completely 24 hours a day, you have your privacy, and you can choose what you speak about. I loved that the cameras couldn't get me - I was just protecting myself. In the future, when people say, \"Oh, I know you,\" I'll say, \"You do, but you only know part of me.\" There's a little bit that my family and friends know that's different. And that's such a nice feeling to have. So yes, I was just evasive when people talked about relationships. But a lot of people were.' Anna believes that Mel and Tom were doing the same sort of thing. Perhaps strategies were firmed up in the first fortnight, when Sada bored everyone to tears with tales of her boyfriend. 'We were in this little cocoon, so to speak constantly about your partner meant that we got a bit pissed off, a little bit agitated.' </p> <p>Then there was Nick. 'He fooled us all,' sighs Anna, without a trace of indulgence, 'and he fooled the nation so much more because everyone's intrigued and adores him. I'm just like, \"Nick, you just need help.\" I was so dim, I just didn't see it.' Maybe she didn't see it because he never showed her his little pieces of paper. I wonder whether she felt the people who did read his notes but failed to blow the whistle were just as culpable. 'Yes. We had a lot of arguments after that. People were saying, why didn't Mel and Tom shout about it? And Craig: Craig's brought it up now that he's been nominated, but why didn't he bring it up before?\" </p> <p>We know that Anna found Craig irritating: she nominated him constantly. But now it's all over, she is gracious without being saccharine. 'He was the right winner. He was perfect. He wanted it the most, it's what the public wanted the most. When he came out and he gave that money to Jo, I was in tears. He was a star. It was the best finale.' But in the end, she lost, didn't she? 'Yes,' says Anna, shuffling her Birkenstocks under the table. 'Craig was a success with the public, and that's absolutely fine with me. But the reason why I'm pleased I stayed till the last week was that it means I was a success in the house. I knew Craig would win, from the first week. Yeah, I was a little disappointed, but then I was thinking: what's this programme all about? Has the most interesting person won? Has the most intelligent person won? Do I want mass popularity? No, I only want the people who I think I would like to like me.' </p> <p>\u0095 Donations to the Heart for Jo Appeal can be made to the Royal Bank of Scotland, sort code 16 33 17, account number 10009836.

      "bodyText": "Even its most dedicated fans - the people who spent last week moping, experiencing a humiliating bereavement after its pyrotechnic climax just nine days ago - will admit that Big Brother was extremely short on mystery. Here was co-ed prison life laid bare for the 24/7 CCTV generation. We saw everything, from the is-this-really-happening? (Nick's machinations, poor Thomas's erection, Caggie's Dark Night of the Soul) to the relentlessly banal (the long hours of fag-rolling, spot-popping and the apparent freeze-frame of bodies lying motionless on the lawn). And, all the time, we listened: to chats about brothels and chickens and George Michael and spiders. As the weeks ground on, the survivors realised how little they had in common, and sensible conversation dried up entirely. When we got into the final lap, those hypnotically dull dog days just before the winner was announced, it seemed that neither Anna, Craig nor Darren could think of anything more interesting to say apart from, 'Anyone for a cup of tea?' The strangest thing was that no one ever asked the most obvious question: Anna, what on earth are you doing in here? Anna Nolan, 'the little Irish lezzie', as Caggie affectionately called her, was different. She may have had a stint as a prison warder, an international basketball player and, most famously, a nun, but she also seemed the most normal person in a very abnormal situation. Of all the housemates, she was the one who gave least away while still managing to participate fully in the life of the house. Some people read this as malevolence. Early on, the Times 's Matthew Parris identified her as a deeply sinister presence; Nasty Nick memorably said that she was 'calculating' and 'deadly as a snake'. But the people who hoped she would walk off with the \u00a370,000 (which, by the end, she desperately wanted, to spend on a deposit for a flat) liked her because she appeared to be the only contestant who was properly equipped for life outside the house. She wasn't a show-off, like Andy, Nichola and Caggie; nor an innocent like Thomas and Darren; nor insecure like Mel and Nick; nor cardboard cutouts like Sada, Craig and Claire. No: she cracked good jokes, she exerted a calming influence on the group, and she never lost it. You'd want Anna on your team every time, precisely because you could rely on her not to release a trashy rave single, or do a stint as a panto villain, or become a brassiere model. Forget her canonisation as a gay icon: her appeal went much wider than that. Anna's sexuality did not define her role on what was ultimately a soap: that alone makes her a unique figure in TV history. Perhaps her greatest achievement was to play Big Brother at his own game: she joined in without selling out, or selling her soul, and she made it to the wire. Naturally, I voted for her (along with 3.41 million others). We saw her come second to Craig, whose 'Heart For Jo' moment provided a startlingly graceful conclusion to the whole circus; we saw her leave the house, looking uncharacteristically dazed in her characteristic get up of jeans and sneakers; and we still never got the answer to that question. Why did you do it, Anna? Anna, who's a month short of her thirtieth birthday, keeps her head down as she follows her recently-acquired PR person into a brasserie in Camden. Yes, she's boyish and skinny, in a long-sleeved T-shirt and jeans and Birkenstocks, just as you would have expected, but there is something different about her. Of course! She's brushed her hair! (Watching the tapes as far as week five, that was the thing that really shocked her. 'It was like two chickens at the back of my head.' She had packed a hairbrush, she says, but forgot about it until the last day.) She orders a gin and tonic - not bad for 2.10pm - and deftly attaches the mike of my dictaphone to her collar, though I get the impression she's a little bit nervous. Explaining why she wanted to go on the show, she says, 'I got carried away, swept along.' She'd seen the documentary about the Dutch version of Big Brother and was intrigued, so applied rather absent-mindedly. Things snowballed from there. When she got the final nod, she remembers thinking: 'Oh, I haven't even decided if I really want to do it yet.' Her long-term girlfriend, Tanya Paice, thought it was a terrible idea; so did her friends and family. 'People said, \"You've only been chosen because you're a lesbian ex-nun. Channel 4 are just going to milk that.\" And I thought, very good point.' So why did she go against everyone's advice? 'It's so appealing, being on television 24 hours a day,' sighs Anna, with dashing irony. 'People say it was sick, it was like an attraction to something perverse, and maybe that's why I did it. But at the end of the day, the reasons why people were saying not to do it - you're a lesbian and that means you might get some bad press - didn't seem to me to be reasons to pull out. I thought I should just be a bit ballsy about it.' In other words, as a self-confident sort of person, she didn't see why her sexuality should inhibit her from having a pop at the prize. Anna grew up in a working-class suburb of Dublin, one of seven siblings. Her dad, Kevin, was a labourer at Guinness; her mother Eileen left school at 14, but has recently taken a degree in classical Greek, and is now studying for an MA. According to their daughter, Mr and Mrs Nolan were described in the press as 'devout Catholic parents of Anna Nolan, the lesbian ex-nun who said she'd bring a vibrator into the house.' Anna imitates her mother's reaction: 'I was disgusted! Devout Irish Catholic - how dare they!' While the Nolan children were growing up, every spare penny went towards their education; all the girls went to a fee-paying convent and had private music instruction. Anna did a degree in music and musical instrument technology at London Guildhall, and then drifted into a series of slackery jobs. Most recently, she was working at a skateboard shop. Eileen, a woman who has evidently got stacks of focus and ambition, is Anna's heroine. One gets the impression that the job offers that are coming her daughter's way - maybe a slot on a London radio station; maybe a presenting role on TV documentaries - may provide a longed-for chance to shift gear, professionally.

No doubt the promise of personality clashes improved sales. </p> <p>But whoever promoted Servants of the People by emphasising one strand in the story did the book no service. For it is far more than a description of major disagreements of which we already knew and minor differences which were of no lasting consequence. It is an exploratory examination of New Labour's body politic and is, in consequence, of considerable importance to anyone who wants the patient to shrug off present indispositions and resume a fully active life.

The limitations of spin are one of his major themes. </p> <p>The Government will dismiss the Rawnsley anecdotes as no more than gossip. Perhaps some of them are. But many of the stories are disturbingly plausible. When the Prime Minister received the news that 'more than one hundred Labour MPs, among them six chairs of select committees, signed a letter to the Chancellor urging him to delay the cut' in single parent's benefit, he 'toyed with the possibility of compromise'. Alastair Campbell rejected the idea on the grounds that the Government would be 'crucified as feeble' by the right-wing tabloids. Philip Gould (the focus group man) thought retreat would look 'weak' and encouraged the view that Tony Blair was 'vacillating' and 'aimless'. They agreed to 'tough it out'. Nobody considered the merits of the proposal.

Confronted with an outcry over Harriet Harman's decision to send her son to a grammar school far outside the borough in which she lived, the same three men considered their response in exactly the same terms. Untroubled by the effect on teacher morale or the sense of betrayal felt by party workers who had fought to end selection, they decided that all that mattered was avoiding the appearance of capitulating to radical opinion. In opposition, obsession with image was just excusable. But government, possessing the power to change people's lives, ought to be motivated by more than headlines.</p> <p>The Raymond Chandler style in which Rawnsley writes, and the sex-and-shopping novel detail which he adds to every anecdote, invites doubts about his sources. He is particularly keen that his readers should know how ministerial car and plane seats are upholstered, and almost every chapter begins with a sentence which proclaims the subtext, 'I was there'. To learn that 'The Prime Minister was in a panic. \"Find Gordon,\" Tony Blair urged his assistant, Anji Hunter' and that 'Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were having one of their quieter, more sinuous arguments' adds to the compelling excitement that makes Servants of the People the most readable contemporary history to be written since New Labour was elected. It also invites the question, 'How does he know?' </p> <p>Doubts are increased by the author's irritating habit of authenticating minor revelations with bogus supporting references. 'Blair now agreed to the Chancellor's plan to give a detailed newspaper interview. \"But talk to Alastair first,\" he said before putting down the phone.'

It is believable because it is typical of the Government's detachment from how the poor live and its hard-hearted distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor. </p> <p>There is much in Rawnsley's account of New Labour's first three years of which the Prime Minister can be proud. He is described as 'a consummate politician, brilliant on presentation with a wonderful style and a real knack of putting his finger on what people are thinking about'. Those are the words of Michael Portillo before he leapt on the petrol price bandwagon. Servants of the People, having quoted them, goes on to demonstrate how true in general they are. Tony Blair's reaction to the death of Princess Diana was inspired because he believed what he was saying. He finds it hard to lead a radical party because he is not a radical. </p> <p>The notion that Tony Blair is determined not to 'repeat Labour's previous past [sic] indiscipline in government' is not so much plausible as obvious. Rawnsley demonstrates unity cannot be achieved by the imposition of the Prime Minister's autocratic will. There will always be Gordon Browns with ideas of their own, Mo Mowlams with unreasonable ambitions and Frank Dobsons with too much self-respect to jump through hoops. </p> <p>The presidential system worked at the beginning - when almost all the Cabinet wanted to dump the Dome but bowed to Tony Blair's wish to retain it. But the longer the Government went on, the more difficult it became to enforce blind obedience in government or party. The result was the farce of the selection of Labour's candidate for Mayor of London and the Welsh Assembly fiasco. What Servants of the People illustrates about New Labour will deserve to be remembered long after the trivia about who knew what about Bernie Ecclestone's donation to Labour's fighting fund is long forgotten.</p>",

Tony Blair's reaction to the death of Princess Diana was inspired because he believed what he was saying. He finds it hard to lead a radical party because he is not a radical. The notion that Tony Blair is determined not to 'repeat Labour's previous past [sic] indiscipline in government' is not so much plausible as obvious. Rawnsley demonstrates unity cannot be achieved by the imposition of the Prime Minister's autocratic will. There will always be Gordon Browns with ideas of their own, Mo Mowlams with unreasonable ambitions and Frank Dobsons with too much self-respect to jump through hoops. The presidential system worked at the beginning - when almost all the Cabinet wanted to dump the Dome but bowed to Tony Blair's wish to retain it. But the longer the Government went on, the more difficult it became to enforce blind obedience in government or party. The result was the farce of the selection of Labour's candidate for Mayor of London and the Welsh Assembly fiasco. What Servants of the People illustrates about New Labour will deserve to be remembered long after the trivia about who knew what about Bernie Ecclestone's donation to Labour's fighting fund is long forgotten.",

      "body": "<p>Some of you have a soft spot for the marrow, to judge from the wheelbarrow full of letters I once received after daring to malign the wretched thing. I have always had my doubts about any vegetable heavy enough to be used as a murder weapon. All ideas were welcome, especially those that avoided minced-beef stuffing. Sorry, mince and marrow just does not ring my bell. Prefix it with the word 'steamed' and we are talking purgatory. </p> <p>But I agree with those who sent recipes for their versions of marrow in white sauce; I, too, rather like the hot, wet blandness of this culinary institution. It is soothing in its delicacy. Sometimes you want something that tastes of absolutely nothing and slithers down without effort. </p> <p>The marrows I bought this week were a fantastic bargain. They cost 60p a piece and were big enough to feed four with a bit of stuffing. In a harvest mood, I bought dahlias with the change, just to annoy the taste police. I took an alternative route from stuffing and let them bubble slowly with olive oil as green as Chartreuse and a couple of handfuls of basil. At the end of cooking I added black pepper and lemon juice. The pale green of the squash shone bright, the marrow softened and took up some of the oil's grassy flavour. </p> <p>Taking the idea on slightly, I dropped some peas into the oil, and a similar amount of water, therefore turning a side dish into a light supper. Those ready-shelled peas from Marks &amp; Spencer or even a bag of the frozen variety would be just the ticket. A few bits of bacon and some chopped salad onions fried till fragrant before you add the chunks of marrow are another possibility - though I have yet to try that one. </p> <p>I have warmed both to the marrow and the swede, of late. Even more so now I have found how good fried marrow is. It's as light as a feather and juicy within if you do it right. Try it this way. Rid the vegetable of its peel - so thick, so inedible - and cut the pale flesh into rough chunks, scooping out the cotton-wool core as you go. Put the pieces into a colander in the sink, sprinkle liberally with sea salt and leave for half an hour or so, till much of the water has dripped away. Rinse briefly, dry and fry. </p> <p>The crispest of these was when I dusted the marrow in flour first, fried it in deep peanut oil then drained it on kitchen paper and seasoned the result with salt, chopped mint leaves and a big squeeze of lemon. </p> <p>Those intent on stuffing their marrow may care to try something different from the usual ground meat. Lentils are good here, partly because of the little bit of crunch they retain if not overcooked. You will need more than just pulses to make a filling worth eating, so try adding them to a base of softened onions, tomato and greens, such as shredded spinach. Herbs are a must. Try mint, coriander or thyme, all of which work well with brown or green lentils. A firm lentil that keeps its shape and texture is the slightly smoky Castellucio variety or the dusky, greeny blue Le Puy. But we must use what we have. Avoid split lentils - they fall to a slush during cooking. </p> <p>A friend told me of another trick. Chop the peeled marrow into thick cubes, lay them in foil with a little butter and some kernels of sweetcorn, then add a decent knob of butter and wrap them loosely, baking till the marrow is soft and juicy. A sweet, buttery smell billows up as you tear open the bag. </p> <p>Marrow reaches its most interesting when it is baked round the Sunday roast. Yes, it collapses a bit, but I am not worried about that. The idea is to let it soften and take up some of the meat juices. Baste it now and again. It is most successful added about half an hour before the meat is due out. When I say meat, I for once mean beef. Like roast parsnips, baked marrow just feels right with beef and particularly with the pan drippings which, if you are lucky, add a delectable savoury sheen. </p> <p>You would think that dried, baked, roast and stuffed were methods enough, but I had a last-minute surprise when I decided to stew some fat slices of marrow slowly in butter. I kept the heat low, pouring in a little peanut oil to stop the butter browning, then, just as the edges started to colour, I chucked in a handful of coriander leaves and put the lid on for a minute or two. It worked better than I would have imagined alongside a plate of grilled Cumberland sausages - even though it did feel like the first meal of winter. </p> <p> <strong> Marrow with peas and basil</strong> </p> <p> Serves 2-4 as an accompaniment </p> <p> <strong>a small marrow <br>100ml olive oil <br>250g podded or frozen peas <br>a handful of basil leaves <br>50g butter <br>the juice of a lemon </strong></p> <p>Peel the skin from the marrow - a pleasing enough task with a vegetable peeler - then halve it, pull out the fluffy core and its seeds and cut the flesh into finger-thick slices. </p> <p>Warm the olive oil in a casserole to which you have a lid, then add the peeled marrow. After 5 minutes of cooking over a moderate heat, pour in 100ml water, the peas and a little salt and cover with a lid. Let the vegetables bubble gently over a lowish heat till the peas are bright and softening and the marrow is well and truly tender. </p> <p>Add the basil, the butter, some black pepper and a good squeeze of lemon juice. </p> <p> <strong> Parchment-baked marrow and sweetcorn</strong> </p> <p> As you tear open the paper, the smell of marrow, sweetcorn, butter and pepper wafts up appetisingly. It makes a cheap supper, though some people may prefer to use it as an accompaniment, in which case it would go very well with some baked ham. For each person, you will need: </p> <p><strong>350g marrow <br>a small cob of corn <br>40g butter </strong></p> <p>Peel the marrow and scrape out the seeds and core, then slice the flesh into thick slices, and then into chunks. You should get about 200g. </p> <p>Lay the marrow on a square of kitchen foil or baking parchment. Pull back the leaves of the corn cob and remove the silky threads from the sharp end. Holding the corn at the fat end and with the pointed end to the paper or foil, cut downwards along the cob slicing off the kernels. Run the blade of the knife along the cob to extract any juice, then discard the remains. </p> <p>Put the butter on top then grind over some salt and black pepper. Wrap the foil around the marrow and corn and seal loosely. </p> <p>Bake at 200 C/gas mark 6 for 30 minutes, by which time the marrow will be soft enough to crush juicily with a fork. Better still, it will have soaked up much of the sweetness from the corn. A buttery, peppery recipe for the end of summer. </p> <p> <strong> Marrow with lentils and spinach</strong> </p> <p> For those determined to stuff their marrow - a spicy lentil filling. The most appropriate lentils are small brown or dark green ones. Serves 4 </p> <p><strong>a medium-sized marrow <br>250g small brown or green lentils <br>2 large shallots <br>4 tbsp olive oil <br>6 medium-sized tomatoes or 20 cherry tomatoes <br>chilli sauce, such as harissa <br>2 handfuls of green leaves such as spinach or chard </strong></p> <p>Bring a pan of water to the boil in which to cook the lentils. Add them to the water and leave to simmer, rather vigorously, until they are soft. </p> <p>Meanwhile, peel and slice the shallots and soften them in a saucepan with the olive oil. Chop the tomatoes, peeling them if they have tough skins (dunk the whole tomato into boiling water then peel off the skin after a few seconds) and add them to the pan. Let them cook a while, till they are soft and mushy, then stir in your chilli sauce. I use a couple of teaspoons of harissa here. The amount will depend on which chilli sauce you have around and how hot you like your lentils to be. Remember that the marrow will soften in the heat. Pour in just enough water (I used barely a tea-cup full) to make a slushy sauce, and add salt and black pepper. </p> <p>Drain the cooked lentils, then stir them into the onion and chilli sauce. Tear the leaves of the spinach or chard up into small pieces and stir them in to the lentils. Bring to the boil, then cover and leave to simmer over a lower heat till the greens |are silky soft. </p> <p>Cut the marrow in half lengthwise, but don't peel it - the rind will give it support. Scoop out the core and slide the two halves into a large pan of boiling, salted water. Leave until they are tender and translucent, then lift out with a draining spoon and lay them in a dish. You could, alternatively, steam it. </p> <p>Spoon the lentil mixture into the hollows in the marrow, cover with foil or greaseproof paper, then bake for 20 minutes at 200 C/gas mark 6. This will enrich the marrow with the flavour of the sauce.</p>",

The amount will depend on which chilli sauce you have around and how hot you like your lentils to be. Remember that the marrow will soften in the heat. Pour in just enough water (I used barely a tea-cup full) to make a slushy sauce, and add salt and black pepper. Drain the cooked lentils, then stir them into the onion and chilli sauce. Tear the leaves of the spinach or chard up into small pieces and stir them in to the lentils. Bring to the boil, then cover and leave to simmer over a lower heat till the greens |are silky soft. Cut the marrow in half lengthwise, but don't peel it - the rind will give it support. Scoop out the core and slide the two halves into a large pan of boiling, salted water. Leave until they are tender and translucent, then lift out with a draining spoon and lay them in a dish. You could, alternatively, steam it. Spoon the lentil mixture into the hollows in the marrow, cover with foil or greaseproof paper, then bake for 20 minutes at 200 C/gas mark 6. This will enrich the marrow with the flavour of the sauce.",

      "body": "<p>When we're at our summer house in western Maine, I walk four miles every day, unless it's pouring down with rain. Three miles of this walk are on dirt roads which wind through the woods; a mile of it is on Route 5, a two-lane blacktop highway which runs between Bethel and Fryeburg.</p> <p>The third week in June of 1999 was an extraordinarily happy one for my wife and me; our kids, now grown and scattered across the country, were all home. It was the first time in nearly six months that we'd all been under the same roof. As an extra bonus, our first grandchild was in the house, three months old and happily jerking at a helium balloon tied to his foot.</p> <p>On 19 June, I drove our younger son to the Portland Jetport, where he caught a flight back to New York City. I drove home, had a brief nap, and then set out on my usual walk. We were planning to go en famille to see The General's Daughter in nearby North Conway, New Hampshire that evening, and I thought I just had time to get my walk in before packing everybody up for the trip.</p> <p>I set out on that walk around four o'clock in the afternoon, as well as I can remember. Just before reaching the main road (in western Maine, any road with a white line running down the middle of it is a main road), I stepped into the woods and urinated. It was two months before I was able to take another leak standing up.</p> <p>When I reached the highway I turned north, walking on the gravel shoulder, against traffic. One car passed me, also headed north. About three-quarters of a mile farther along, the woman driving the car observed a light-blue Dodge van heading south. The van was looping from one side of the road to the other, barely under the driver's control. The woman in the car turned to her passenger when they were safely past the wandering van and said, 'That was Stephen King walking back there. I sure hope that guy in the van doesn't hit him.'</p> <p>Most of the sightlines along the mile of Route 5 which I walk are good, but there is one stretch, a short, steep hill, where a pedestrian walking north can see very little of what might be coming his way. I was three-quarters of the way up this hill when Bryan Smith, the owner and operator of the light-blue Dodge van, came over the crest.</p> <p>He wasn't on the road; he was on the shoulder. My shoulder. I had perhaps three-quarters of a second to register this. It was just time enough to think, My God, I'm going to be hit by a school bus . I started to turn to my left. There is a break in my memory here. On the other side of it, I'm on the ground, looking at the back of the van, which is now pulled off the road and tilted to one side.</p> <p>This recollection is very clear and sharp, more like a snapshot than a memory. There is dust around the van's tail-lights. The licence plate and the back windows are dirty. I register these things with no thought that I have been in an accident, or of anything else. It's a snapshot, that's all. I'm not thinking; my head has been swopped clean.</p> <p>There's another little break in my memory here, and then I am very carefully wiping palmfuls of blood out of my eyes with my left hand. When my eyes are reasonably clear, I look around and see a man sitting on a nearby rock. He has a cane drawn across his lap. This is Bryan Smith, 42 years of age, the man who hit me with his van. Smith has got quite a driving record; he has racked up nearly a dozen vehicle-related offences.</p> <p>Smith wasn't looking at the road on the afternoon our lives came together, because his Rottweiler had jumped from the very rear of his van into the back-seat area, where there was an Igloo cooler with some meat stored inside. The Rottweiler's name is Bullet (Smith has another Rottweiler at home; that one is named Pistol). Bullet started to nose at the lid of the cooler. Smith turned around and tried to push Bullet away. He was still looking at Bullet and pushing his head away from the cooler when he came over the top of the knoll; still looking and pushing when he struck me.</p> <p>Smith told friends later that he thought he'd hit 'a small deer' until he noticed my bloody spectacles lying on the front seat of his van. They were knocked from my face when I tried to get out of Smith's way. The frames were bent and twisted, but the lenses were unbroken. They are the lenses I'm wearing now, as I write this.</p> <p>Smith sees I'm awake and tells me help is on the way. He speaks calmly, even cheerily. His look, as he sits on his rock with his cane drawn across his lap, is one of pleasant commiseration: Ain't the two of us just had the shittiest luck? it says. He and Bullet left the campground where they were staying, he later tells an investigator, because he wanted 'some of those Marzes-bars they have up to the store'. When I hear this little detail some weeks later, it occurs to me that I have nearly been killed by a character right out of one of my own novels. It's almost funny.</p> <p> Help is on the way, I think, and that's probably good because I've been in a hell of an accident. I'm lying in the ditch and there's blood all over my face and my right leg hurts. I look down and see something I don't like: my lap now appears to be on sideways, as if my whole lower body had been wrenched half a turn to the right. I look back up at the man with the cane and say, 'Please tell me it's just dislocated.'</p> <p>'Nah,' he says. Like his face, his voice is cheery, only mildly interested. He could be watching all this on TV while he noshes on one of those Marzes-bars. 'It's broken in five I'd say maybe six places.' 'I'm sorry,' I tell him - God knows why - and then I'm gone again for a little while. It isn't like blacking out; it's more as if the film of memory has been spliced here and there.</p> <p>When I come back this time, an orange-and-white van is idling at the side of the road with its flashers going. An emergency medical technician - Paul Fillebrown is his name - is kneeling beside me. He's doing something. Cutting off my jeans, I think, although that might have come later.</p> <p>I ask him if I can have a cigarette. He laughs and says not hardly. I ask him if I'm going to die. He tells me no, I'm not going to die, but I need to go to the hospital, and fast. I ask Fillebrown again if I'm going to die, and he tells me again that I'm not. Then he asks me if I can wiggle the toes on my right foot. 'My toes, did they move?' I ask Paul Fillebrown. He says they did, a good healthy wiggle. 'Do you swear to God?' I ask him, and I think he does. I'm starting to pass out again. Fillebrown asks me, very slowly and loudly, bending down into my face, if my wife is at the big house on the lake. I can't remember. I can't remember where any of my family is, but I'm able to give him the telephone numbers of both our big house and the cottage on the far side of the lake where my daughter sometimes stays. Hell, I could give him my Social Security number, if he asked. I've got all my numbers. It's just everything else that's gone.</p> <p>Other people are arriving now. Somewhere a radio is crackling out police calls. I'm put on a stretcher. It hurts, and I scream. I'm lifted into the back of the EMT truck, and the police calls are closer. The doors shut and someone up front says, 'You want to really hammer it.' Then we're rolling.</p> <p>Paul Fillebrown sits down beside me. He has a pair of clippers and tells me he's going to have to cut the ring off the third finger of my right hand - it's a wedding ring Tabby gave me in 1983, 12 years after we were actually married. I try to tell Fillebrown that I wear it on my right hand because the real wedding ring is still on the third finger of my left - the original two-ring set cost me $15.95 at Day's Jewelers in Bangor. That first ring only cost eight bucks, in other words, but it seems to have worked.</p> <p>Some garbled version of this comes out, probably nothing Paul Fillebrown can actually understand, but he keeps nodding and smiling as he cuts that second, more expensive, wedding ring off my swollen right hand. Two months or so later, I call Fillebrown to thank him; by then I understand that he probably saved my life by administering the correct on-scene medical aid and then getting me to the hospital at a speed of roughly 110mph, over patched and bumpy back roads.</p> <p>Fillebrown assures me that I'm more than welcome, then suggests that perhaps someone was watching out for me. 'I've been doing this for 20 years,' he tells me over the phone, 'and when I saw the way you were lying in the ditch, plus the extent of the impact injuries, I didn't think you'd make it to the hospital. You're a lucky camper to still be with the program.'</p> <p>The extent of the impact injuries is such that the doctors at Northern Cumberland Hospital decide they cannot treat me there; someone summons a LifeFlight helicopter to take me to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston. At this point my wife, older son, and daughter arrive. The kids are allowed a brief visit; my wife is allowed to stay longer. The doctors have assured her that I'm banged up, but I'll make it.</p> <p>The lower half of my body has been covered. She isn't allowed to look at the interesting way my lap has shifted around to the right, but she is allowed to wash the blood off my face and pick some of the glass out of my hair. There's a long gash in my scalp, the result of my collision with Bryan Smith's windshield. This impact came at a point less than two inches from the steel, driver's-side support post. Had I struck that, I likely would have been killed or rendered permanently comatose, a vegetable with legs. Had I struck the rocks jutting out of the ground beyond the shoulder of Route 5, I likely also would have been killed or permanently paralysed. I didn't hit them; I was thrown over the van and 14ft in the air, but landed just shy of the rocks.</p> <p>'You must have pivoted to the left just a little at the last second,' Dr David Brown tells me later. 'If you hadn't, we wouldn't be having this conversation.'</p> <p>The LifeFlight helicopter lands in the parking lot of Northern Cumberland Hospital, and I am wheeled out to it. The sky is very bright, very blue. The clatter of the helicopter's rotors is very loud. Someone shouts into my ear, 'Ever been in a helicopter before, Stephen?' The speaker sounds jolly, all excited for me. I try to answer yes, I've been in a helicopter before - twice, in fact - but I can't. All at once, it's very tough to breathe.</p> <p>They load me into the helicopter. I can see one brilliant wedge of blue sky as we lift off; not a cloud in it. Beautiful. There are more radio voices. This is my afternoon for hearing voices, it seems. Meanwhile, it's getting even harder to breathe. I gesture at someone, or try to, and a face bends upside down into my field of vision.</p> <p>'Feel like I'm drowning,' I whisper.</p> <p>Somebody checks something, and someone else says, 'His lung has collapsed.'</p> <p>There's a rattle of paper as something is unwrapped, and then the someone else speaks into my ear, loudly so as to be heard over the rotors. 'We're going to put a chest tube in you, Stephen. You'll feel some pain, a little pinch. Hold on.'</p> <p>It's like being thumped very high up on the right side of the chest by someone holding a short sharp object. Then there's an alarming whistle in my chest, as if I've sprung a leak. In fact, I suppose I have. A moment later, the soft in-out of normal respiration, which I've listened to my whole life (mostly without being aware of it, thank God), has been replaced by an unpleasant shloop-shloop-shloop sound. The air I'm taking in is very cold, but it's air, at least, air, and I keep breathing it. I don't want to die. I love my wife, my kids, my afternoon walks by the lake. I also love to write. I don't want to die, and as I lie in the helicopter looking out at the bright blue summer sky, I realise that I am actually lying in death's doorway. Someone is going to pull me one way or the other pretty soon; it's mostly out of my hands. All I can do is lie there, look at the sky, and listen to my thin, leaky breathing: shloop-shloop-shloop.</p> <p>Ten minutes later, we set down on the concrete landing pad at CMMC. To me, it seems to be at the bottom of a concrete well. The blue sky is blotted out and the whap-whap-whap of the helicopter rotors becomes magnified and echoey, like the clapping of giant hands.</p> <p>Still breathing in great leaky gulps, I am lifted out of the helicopter. Someone bumps the stretcher and I scream. 'Sorry, sorry, you're okay, Stephen,' someone says - when you're badly hurt, everyone calls you by your first name, everyone is your pal.</p> <p>'Tell Tabby I love her very much,' I say as I am first lifted and then wheeled, very fast, down some sort of descending concrete walkway. All at once I feel like crying.</p> <p>'You can tell her that yourself,' the someone says. We go through a door; there is air-conditioning and lights flowing past overhead. Speakers issue pages. It occurs to me, in a muddled sort of way, that an hour before I was taking a walk and planning to pick some berries in a field that overlooks Lake Kezar. I wouldn't pick for long, though; I'd have to be home by 5.30 because we were all going to the movies. The General's Daughter , starring John Travolta. Travolta was in the movie made out of Carrie , my first novel. He played the bad guy. That was a long time ago.</p> <p> 'When?' I ask. 'When can I tell her?'</p> <p>'Soon,' the voice says, and then I pass out again. This time it's no splice but a great big whack taken out of the memory-film; there are a few flashes, confused glimpses of faces and operating rooms and looming X-ray machinery; there are delusions and hallucinations fed by the morphine and Dilaudid being dripped into me; there are echoing voices and hands that reach down to paint my dry lips with swabs that taste of peppermint. Mostly, though, there is darkness.</p> <p>Bryan Smith's estimate of my injuries turned out to be conservative. My lower leg was broken in at least nine places - the orthopaedic surgeon who put me together again, the formidable David Brown, said that the region below my right knee had been reduced to 'so many marbles in a sock.'</p> <p>The extent of those lower-leg injuries necessitated two deep incisions - they're called medial and lateral fasciatomies - to release the pressure caused by the exploded tibia and also to allow blood to flow back into the lower leg. Without the fasciatomies (or if the fasciatomies had been delayed), it probably would have been necessary to amputate the leg. My right knee itself was split almost directly down the middle; the technical term for the injury is 'comminuted intra-articular tibial fracture'. I also suffered an acetabular cup fracture of the right hip - a serious derailment, in other words - and an open femoral intertrochanteric fracture in the same area. My spine was chipped in eight places. Four ribs were broken. My right collarbone held, but the flesh above it was stripped raw. The laceration in my scalp took 20 or 30 stitches. Yeah, on the whole, I'd say Bryan Smith was a tad conservative.</p> <p>Mr Smith's driving behaviour in this case was eventually examined by a grand jury, who indicted him on two counts: driving to endanger (pretty serious) and aggravated assault (very serious, the kind of thing that means jail time). After due consideration, the District Attorney responsible for prosecuting such cases in my little corner of the world allowed Smith to plead out to the lesser charge of driving to endanger. He received six months of county jail time (sentence suspended) and a year's suspension of his privilege to drive. He was also put on probation for a year with restrictions on other motor vehicles, such as snowmobiles and ATVs. It is conceivable that Bryan Smith could be legally back on the road in the fall or winter of 2001.</p> <p>David Brown put my leg back together in five marathon surgical procedures that left me thin, weak and nearly at the end of my endurance. They also left me with at least a fighting chance to walk again. A large steel and carbon-fibre apparatus called an external fixator was clamped to my leg. Eight large steel pegs called Schanz pins run through the fixator and into the bones above and below my knee. Five smaller steel rods radiate out from the knee. These look sort of like a child's drawing of sunrays. The knee itself was locked in place. I entered the hospital on 19 June. Around the 25th, I got up for the first time, staggering three steps to a commode, where I sat with my hospital johnny in my lap and my head down, trying not to weep and failing. You try to tell yourself that you've been lucky, most incredibly lucky, and usually that works because it's true. Sometimes it doesn't work, that's all. Then you cry.</p> <p>A day or two after those initial steps, I started physical therapy. During my first session, I managed 10 steps in a downstairs corridor, lurching along with the help of a walker. One other patient was learning to walk again at the same time, a wispy 80-year-old woman named Alice who was recovering from a stroke. We cheered each other on when we had enough breath to do so. On our third day in the downstairs hall, I told Alice that her slip was showing.</p> <p>'Your ass is showing, sonnyboy,' she wheezed, and kept going.</p> <p>I came home to Bangor on 9 July, after a hospital stay of three weeks. I began a daily rehab program which includes stretching, bending, and crutch-walking. I tried to keep my courage and my spirits up. On 4 August, I went back to CMMC for another operation. When I woke up this time, the Schanz pins in my upper thigh were gone. I could bend my knee again. Dr Brown pronounced my recovery 'on course' and sent me home for more rehab and physical therapy. And in the midst of all this, something else happened. On 24 July, five weeks after Bryan Smith hit me with his Dodge van, I began to write again.</p> <p>\u00a9 2000 Stephen King.

I didn't hit them; I was thrown over the van and 14ft in the air, but landed just shy of the rocks. 'You must have pivoted to the left just a little at the last second,' Dr David Brown tells me later. 'If you hadn't, we wouldn't be having this conversation.' The LifeFlight helicopter lands in the parking lot of Northern Cumberland Hospital, and I am wheeled out to it. The sky is very bright, very blue. The clatter of the helicopter's rotors is very loud. Someone shouts into my ear, 'Ever been in a helicopter before, Stephen?' The speaker sounds jolly, all excited for me. I try to answer yes, I've been in a helicopter before - twice, in fact - but I can't. All at once, it's very tough to breathe. They load me into the helicopter. I can see one brilliant wedge of blue sky as we lift off; not a cloud in it. Beautiful. There are more radio voices. This is my afternoon for hearing voices, it seems. Meanwhile, it's getting even harder to breathe. I gesture at someone, or try to, and a face bends upside down into my field of vision. 'Feel like I'm drowning,' I whisper. Somebody checks something, and someone else says, 'His lung has collapsed.' There's a rattle of paper as something is unwrapped, and then the someone else speaks into my ear, loudly so as to be heard over the rotors. 'We're going to put a chest tube in you, Stephen. You'll feel some pain, a little pinch. Hold on.' It's like being thumped very high up on the right side of the chest by someone holding a short sharp object. Then there's an alarming whistle in my chest, as if I've sprung a leak. In fact, I suppose I have. A moment later, the soft in-out of normal respiration, which I've listened to my whole life (mostly without being aware of it, thank God), has been replaced by an unpleasant shloop-shloop-shloop sound. The air I'm taking in is very cold, but it's air, at least, air, and I keep breathing it. I don't want to die. I love my wife, my kids, my afternoon walks by the lake. I also love to write. I don't want to die, and as I lie in the helicopter looking out at the bright blue summer sky, I realise that I am actually lying in death's doorway. Someone is going to pull me one way or the other pretty soon; it's mostly out of my hands. All I can do is lie there, look at the sky, and listen to my thin, leaky breathing: shloop-shloop-shloop. Ten minutes later, we set down on the concrete landing pad at CMMC. To me, it seems to be at the bottom of a concrete well. The blue sky is blotted out and the whap-whap-whap of the helicopter rotors becomes magnified and echoey, like the clapping of giant hands. Still breathing in great leaky gulps, I am lifted out of the helicopter. Someone bumps the stretcher and I scream. 'Sorry, sorry, you're okay, Stephen,' someone says - when you're badly hurt, everyone calls you by your first name, everyone is your pal. 'Tell Tabby I love her very much,' I say as I am first lifted and then wheeled, very fast, down some sort of descending concrete walkway. All at once I feel like crying. 'You can tell her that yourself,' the someone says. We go through a door; there is air-conditioning and lights flowing past overhead. Speakers issue pages. It occurs to me, in a muddled sort of way, that an hour before I was taking a walk and planning to pick some berries in a field that overlooks Lake Kezar. I wouldn't pick for long, though; I'd have to be home by 5.30 because we were all going to the movies. The General's Daughter , starring John Travolta. Travolta was in the movie made out of Carrie , my first novel. He played the bad guy. That was a long time ago. 'When?' I ask. 'When can I tell her?' 'Soon,' the voice says, and then I pass out again. This time it's no splice but a great big whack taken out of the memory-film; there are a few flashes, confused glimpses of faces and operating rooms and looming X-ray machinery; there are delusions and hallucinations fed by the morphine and Dilaudid being dripped into me; there are echoing voices and hands that reach down to paint my dry lips with swabs that taste of peppermint. Mostly, though, there is darkness. Bryan Smith's estimate of my injuries turned out to be conservative. My lower leg was broken in at least nine places - the orthopaedic surgeon who put me together again, the formidable David Brown, said that the region below my right knee had been reduced to 'so many marbles in a sock.' The extent of those lower-leg injuries necessitated two deep incisions - they're called medial and lateral fasciatomies - to release the pressure caused by the exploded tibia and also to allow blood to flow back into the lower leg. Without the fasciatomies (or if the fasciatomies had been delayed), it probably would have been necessary to amputate the leg. My right knee itself was split almost directly down the middle; the technical term for the injury is 'comminuted intra-articular tibial fracture'. I also suffered an acetabular cup fracture of the right hip - a serious derailment, in other words - and an open femoral intertrochanteric fracture in the same area. My spine was chipped in eight places. Four ribs were broken. My right collarbone held, but the flesh above it was stripped raw. The laceration in my scalp took 20 or 30 stitches. Yeah, on the whole, I'd say Bryan Smith was a tad conservative. Mr Smith's driving behaviour in this case was eventually examined by a grand jury, who indicted him on two counts: driving to endanger (pretty serious) and aggravated assault (very serious, the kind of thing that means jail time). After due consideration, the District Attorney responsible for prosecuting such cases in my little corner of the world allowed Smith to plead out to the lesser charge of driving to endanger. He received six months of county jail time (sentence suspended) and a year's suspension of his privilege to drive. He was also put on probation for a year with restrictions on other motor vehicles, such as snowmobiles and ATVs. It is conceivable that Bryan Smith could be legally back on the road in the fall or winter of 2001. David Brown put my leg back together in five marathon surgical procedures that left me thin, weak and nearly at the end of my endurance. They also left me with at least a fighting chance to walk again. A large steel and carbon-fibre apparatus called an external fixator was clamped to my leg. Eight large steel pegs called Schanz pins run through the fixator and into the bones above and below my knee. Five smaller steel rods radiate out from the knee. These look sort of like a child's drawing of sunrays. The knee itself was locked in place. I entered the hospital on 19 June. Around the 25th, I got up for the first time, staggering three steps to a commode, where I sat with my hospital johnny in my lap and my head down, trying not to weep and failing. You try to tell yourself that you've been lucky, most incredibly lucky, and usually that works because it's true. Sometimes it doesn't work, that's all. Then you cry. A day or two after those initial steps, I started physical therapy. During my first session, I managed 10 steps in a downstairs corridor, lurching along with the help of a walker. One other patient was learning to walk again at the same time, a wispy 80-year-old woman named Alice who was recovering from a stroke. We cheered each other on when we had enough breath to do so. On our third day in the downstairs hall, I told Alice that her slip was showing. 'Your ass is showing, sonnyboy,' she wheezed, and kept going. I came home to Bangor on 9 July, after a hospital stay of three weeks. I began a daily rehab program which includes stretching, bending, and crutch-walking. I tried to keep my courage and my spirits up. On 4 August, I went back to CMMC for another operation. When I woke up this time, the Schanz pins in my upper thigh were gone. I could bend my knee again. Dr Brown pronounced my recovery 'on course' and sent me home for more rehab and physical therapy. And in the midst of all this, something else happened. On 24 July, five weeks after Bryan Smith hit me with his Dodge van, I began to write again. \u00a9 2000 Stephen King. Extracted from On Writing, \u00a316.99, published by Hodder and Stoughton on 3 October.",

We are well on course to beat the record of 13 such deaths in 12 months set in 1999, a dubious achievement by anybody's standards. </p> <p>A former civil servant called Ian Thomas would doubtless have been as horrified as us all by Kevin's death, but he couldn't exactly have claimed to be surprised. Three weeks before the suicide, Thomas resigned as Deputy Governor of Feltham in protest at what he described as the 'Dickensian' conditions there. They were, he said, 'dangerous and anti-social', a direct result of appalling over-crowding. Because of a shortage of suitable beds, more than 100 young offenders aged 15 to 17 were being locked away for up to 22 hours a day in cells designed for older inmates. </p> <p>Reacting to Thomas's resignation Martin Narey, Director General of the Prison Service, told Radio 4's Today programme that his decision to go didn't make sense given that they were about to open the new \u00a36 million unit. What Narey didn't say during his sudden bout of exasperated hand-wringing is that the new unit is not an accommodation block. It houses an education and reception centre. People don't commit suicide in education centres. They do it in their cells at dead of night when they are alone - and nothing about those cells at Feltham has changed at all. </p> <p>Last week Kevin Henson's dad - also called Kevin - was given the chance to see the cell where his son died. 'You could see the pipes that he was able to hang himself from,' he said after the visit. 'How much work would it take to sink those pipes into the wall? The authorities say well, if they want to do they'll find a way, but please, take away the bloody obvious. You might as well hang a noose in each cell.' </p> <p>Kevin Henson Snr now knows, however, that the architecture at Feltham is only a part of the problem. It's the way the place works - or doesn't - that does the serious damage. He is under no illusions about his son; Kevin Jnr had a major drink problem, which developed after the death of his mother when he was 14, and a long criminal record for one so young, most of the offences committed under the influence of alcohol. When Kevin was remanded to Feltham for a malicious wounding charge his dad saw it as, potentially, a good thing. 'We thought it might be a blessing in disguise,' he says now, 'because it would keep him away from the drink.' </p> <p>Very soon it became clear it was anything but. Indeed, the regime was exactly as Ian Thomas had alleged when he resigned. Kevin wrote from Feltham about being banged up in his cell for almost the entire day with nothing to do and nothing for company but his own dark thoughts. His phone card had run out and Feltham would not allow his dad to send in another one so he had no way of contacting anybody. Inmates are forced to wait five days until postal orders clear and even then they can't buy anything unless it's a Thursday; as a result he was destined to sit, barred from contact with anybody who might be able to give him any kind of emotional support, for up to 10 days. </p> <p>'It was his first time there, he was withdrawing from the drink and from the cigarettes plus there was no way he could talk to anyone. Why the big deal about letting us get phone cards to him? He was only on remand.' </p> <p>The prison padre later told Kevin Snr that he has phone cards for emergencies but he doesn't tell the boys about them. 'He said they would just abuse the service. They might as well not have any emergency phone cards at all.' Kevin had previously been diagnosed with depression but, for reasons that remain unclear, that had not been passed on when he went inside. Instead it would have been up to Kevin himself to inform the authorities of his own declining mental state if he was to be put on any kind of suicide watch. But, in a classic Catch 22, it is a recognised and common symptom of the illness that sufferers don't easily or quickly open up about it. He was, in short, left completely on his own. </p> <p>The bottom line is that Kevin, like so many of the 400 other children locked up in Britain's secure units - up from 200 just a year ago - was not best served by being there. After years of pushing and pleading, his dad had managed to get him help from social services to beat the drink problem, which Kevin himself knew was his undoing, and a probation officer had developed a complex support and rehabilitation plan for him. The Children's Society, which works with young offenders, has found that such plans have a 70 per cent success rate. Nevertheless, at a remand hearing on 5 September, bail was refused. He realised that he would not be able to visit his mother's grave, as he had done every year on her birthday. And that night he killed himself. </p> <p>This is not just an issue for the governors of individual prisons. It's a matter of Government having to decide it is bad policy to send kids like Kevin to prisons which are ill-equipped to care for them. But at the moment Jack Straw's Home Office doesn't seem to give a damn. 'We keep raising the issue with Ministers but they are just not interested,' says Deborah Coles of Inquest, the organisation which supports the families of people who die in custody. 'At the end of day, it seems dead children are not an important electoral issue.' </p> <p>That's the problem. People like Kevin Henson do not make for sexy politics. 'Kevin was no angel,' his dad says. 'He was no help to himself. But he didn't deserve to die.' What he hopes now is that nobody else will have to go through what he and the remainder of his family is going through. 'And I don't want to hear anyone saying we're going to learn the lessons from Kevin's death when it's happened so many times before. It's an insult to the other families and it's an insult to us.' </p> <p>As the combined forces of the British media traipse about Feltham's new wing next month, the smell of fresh paint in their nostrils, they might like to ask the management of the prison exactly what they are going to do to stop other people like Kevin Henson being turned from difficult and troubled teenagers into gruesome statistics. </p>",

His wise and subversive Histories record with unflinching though unreliable authority details of Mediterranean life under the Romans in the second century AD. Amongst his discoveries were lands \"where citizens were as dexterous with their toes as with their fingers\".' </p> <p>Okay, it's not exactly a side-splitter, but it's a joke nevertheless - a fake author buried among the thousands of diligently researched, lucidly written, real-author entries in the new, 1,100-page Oxford Companion to English Literature; a witty little curlicue in the otherwise respectful work of scholarship. </p> <p>The entry was written by 'CRACE, Jim [1946], novelist born in Hertfordshire', but the Companion is edited by 'DRABBLE, Margaret [1939], novelist born in Sheffield and educated at the Mount School, York, and Newnham College, Cambridge.' </p> <p>Margaret Drabble says that she included it in the Companion as a joke and to 'make sure people look closely at the text and pay attention'. But to many, the second, teacherly reason seems more typical of Drabble than the first. For she is not generally thought of as a joker, but as calm, diligent, sensible, stoical, decent; an uncorrupted and unswerving writer standing for stalwart, old-fashioned, northern values; Old Labour, not New; traditional literature, not modernist or postmodernist. </p> <p>With her shrewd and pleasant expression, her no-nonsense fringe, her self-confident and assertive manner, she doesn't exactly come across as playful. </p> <p>Appearances can deceive. As her friend, 'TOMALIN, Claire, [1933-], biographer, born in London, educated at Newnham College, Cambridge', says: 'While she is superlatively intelligent and warm-hearted, like an ideal head-girl of the literary world of her generation, I suspect she is a good deal more complicated underneath the surface.' </p> <p>Indeed, she seems rather like one of her nineteenth-century fictional heroines, like a Jane Eyre or an Elizabeth Bennett, whose passions surge beneath the decorous surface. Drabble says of herself that 'she lives in a state of acute anxiety'. She talks of things 'festering inside' and of the need to 'find peace'. </p> <p>She comes from a family of depressives and has struggled through dark periods herself (she says that reports that she contemplated suicide are 'not quite right'). She had a tormented relationship with her mother, has an uncomfortable one with her sister ('BYATT, Dame A[ntonia] S[usan] [1936-], novelist and critic') and an often painful one with her critics, who swung from admiration in her early, glamorous years to hostility and derision later. </p> <p>Once she was acclaimed for writing about women's lives in a way that was new and vastly influential; about the experience of abortion, childbirth or maternity. Later, however, she was labelled a middle-class 'Hampstead novelist' and her thoughtful and ironic books were held up as models of a doomed literature. She is unapologetic about her uncompromising realism: she has written a biography of old-fashioned Arnold Bennett, championed the ignored Angus Wilson, loved Hardy and Wordsworth. Her heart seems to lie with the past. As early as 1967, she was saying: 'I'd rather be at the end of a dying tradition, which I admire, than at the beginning of a tradition which I deplore.' </p> <p>Margaret Drabble was born just before the Second World War. Her father was a QC and a Labour candidate in the 1945 and 1950 elections. Her mother, Kathleen, who died 18 years ago, was a teacher and a depressive. She dominated her two daughters and her son. When she died, Byatt said it was as if the 'blue sky' had opened. Drabble, her mother's favourite, went to school in Sheffield until the age of 13, and then to the Quaker Mount School in York, which she loved. Always top of the class, just as Byatt was top of hers, she won a scholarship to Newnham, as Byatt had done before her, and left with a first-class degree. She says that at school she worked, but at university she 'played'. She did a lot of acting, apparently specialising in 'tragic heroines', alongside Ian McKellen, Derek Jacobi, Eleanor Bron and Clive Swift, whom she later married. </p> <p>After Cambridge, the two sisters' paths diverged, but not for long. Drabble, aged 23, married and she followed her husband to Stratford. Here, she had some minor roles, but during this period she thought of herself, bleakly, as 'just a wife'. She didn't know how to cook and she didn't know about contraception; nine-and-a-half months after the couple married, she was pregnant. </p> <p>She published her first novel, A Summer Birdcage, in 1962, on an advance of \u00a350. It came out a few months before Byatt's first novel and is about two sisters (sisters feature in both sisters' works - in Byatt's The Game, one sister kills another) and was an immediate success. The novels that followed, including The Garrick Year, The Millstone, Jerusalem the Golden, The Waterfall and The Needle's Eye, all examine what it is to be a woman in contemporary society. </p> <p>The female protagonists, however, are both modern and not: they are placed in an emphatically contemporary setting, but they all have nineteenth-century names (Rosamund, Clara, Emma, Lucy, Jane). They discuss classic literature with each other as often as mundane concerns. As the critic Elaine Showalter says, many of them eventually submit to female limitations. Children are the compensation for surrender. At the same time as she was bearing and looking after three children of her own, Drabble becomes the novelist of maternity and female boundaries. </p> <p>In 1975, Drabble and Swift divorced. By now, she was living in a large house in north-west London and was a successful novelist. She entered what critics called her 'Hampstead period', writing her trilogy - The Radiant Way, A Natural Curiosity, The Gates of Ivory - which followed the fortunes of three women friends through the social and political changes in Britain in the 1980s. She also worked hard for the British Council and for Pen. She fought against the closure of the libraries. She stood by the school gates of the local state school (she has always believed in 'redistribution and non-selective education'). Claire Tomalin believes that 'she is one of the few modern novelists who has actually changed government policy, by what she wrote in The Millstone about visiting children in hospital'. </p> <p>In 1981, she became involved with the biographer 'HOLROYD, Michael de Courcy Fraser [1935-], born in London and educated at Eton'. In 1982, they married, but for a while they kept their separate houses. Now that they live together, they still maintain a careful, writerly distance - he works upstairs, she works in the basement; they meet in the middle and at the end of their working days. </p> <p>The woman who was 'best man' when Drabble married Holroyd, 'BAINBRIDGE, Beryl [1934-], novelist, born in Liverpool', says that Drabble is a woman of great, unswerving loyalty to her friends. Drabble, talking about the Companion, talks of the bond between women: 'Women are not exempt from rivalry and ambition but there is something in the circumstances of their lives that gives them a common bond.' </p> <p>The Companion is a work of generosity towards other writers, and particularly to women writers, whose entries have risen considerably since she first became the editor in 1985. Towards her sister, Antonia Byatt, there has been considerable and well-documented rivalry, however. Drabble, the younger sister, was always on her sister's heels, with the punitive ghost of their mother behind them both. The sisters seemed to have achieved some kind of reconciliation recently - Byatt won the Booker Prize for Possession and was made a dame, and Drabble commented ruefully: 'Now she's way out ahead in public opinion, and feels better, and I feel OK.' </p> <p>There were (very grudging) statements of support. Byatt said that 'at the last ditch' they would help each other, although maybe, she qualified, not at the first ditch. </p> <p>That will change with her novel to be published in January, The Peppered Moth, which is based on the tormented and tormenting life of her mother, the most 'enraged housewife' ever. The novel relies on family documents, local newspapers, even her mother's old school reports. Perhaps Drabble really has trodden on her sister's toes this time, for she is plundering a commonly-shared history, making their story hers. </p> <p>She wants, she says, to 'exorcise all the old ghosts which have festered inside'. Byatt says of the novel that it will be 'one-sided. I would rather people didn't read someone else's version of my mother'. Drabble responded with: 'It's got nothing to do with her.' </p> <p>It's clearly a novel Drabble felt compelled to write. 'I hope to put the past to rest and find some kind of peace,' she says. Drabble has spent many years researching and recording other people's literary achievements. Now she returns to her own literature, to become an entry in someone else's book, not just a footnote in her own. </p> <p><strong> MARGARET DRABBLE</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> DoB :</strong> 5 June, 1939 </p> <p><strong> Educated: </strong> The Mount School, York; Newnham College, Cambridge </p> <p><strong> Status: </strong> Married to biographer Michael Holroyd </p> <p><strong> Publications: </strong> Arnold Bennett: a Biography; For Queen and Country; A Writer's Britain; Angus Wilson: a Biography; editor Oxford Companion to English Literature </p> <p><strong> Recreations :</strong> Walking and dreaming</p>",

      "bodyText": "'PYCLETIUS [c116-c163], Graeco-Spanish geographer and traveller, trading ambassador in Spain for Antoninus Pius. His wise and subversive Histories record with unflinching though unreliable authority details of Mediterranean life under the Romans in the second century AD. Amongst his discoveries were lands \"where citizens were as dexterous with their toes as with their fingers\".' Okay, it's not exactly a side-splitter, but it's a joke nevertheless - a fake author buried among the thousands of diligently researched, lucidly written, real-author entries in the new, 1,100-page Oxford Companion to English Literature; a witty little curlicue in the otherwise respectful work of scholarship. The entry was written by 'CRACE, Jim [1946], novelist born in Hertfordshire', but the Companion is edited by 'DRABBLE, Margaret [1939], novelist born in Sheffield and educated at the Mount School, York, and Newnham College, Cambridge.' Margaret Drabble says that she included it in the Companion as a joke and to 'make sure people look closely at the text and pay attention'. But to many, the second, teacherly reason seems more typical of Drabble than the first. For she is not generally thought of as a joker, but as calm, diligent, sensible, stoical, decent; an uncorrupted and unswerving writer standing for stalwart, old-fashioned, northern values; Old Labour, not New; traditional literature, not modernist or postmodernist. With her shrewd and pleasant expression, her no-nonsense fringe, her self-confident and assertive manner, she doesn't exactly come across as playful. Appearances can deceive. As her friend, 'TOMALIN, Claire, [1933-], biographer, born in London, educated at Newnham College, Cambridge', says: 'While she is superlatively intelligent and warm-hearted, like an ideal head-girl of the literary world of her generation, I suspect she is a good deal more complicated underneath the surface.' Indeed, she seems rather like one of her nineteenth-century fictional heroines, like a Jane Eyre or an Elizabeth Bennett, whose passions surge beneath the decorous surface. Drabble says of herself that 'she lives in a state of acute anxiety'. She talks of things 'festering inside' and of the need to 'find peace'. She comes from a family of depressives and has struggled through dark periods herself (she says that reports that she contemplated suicide are 'not quite right'). She had a tormented relationship with her mother, has an uncomfortable one with her sister ('BYATT, Dame A[ntonia] S[usan] [1936-], novelist and critic') and an often painful one with her critics, who swung from admiration in her early, glamorous years to hostility and derision later. Once she was acclaimed for writing about women's lives in a way that was new and vastly influential; about the experience of abortion, childbirth or maternity. Later, however, she was labelled a middle-class 'Hampstead novelist' and her thoughtful and ironic books were held up as models of a doomed literature. She is unapologetic about her uncompromising realism: she has written a biography of old-fashioned Arnold Bennett, championed the ignored Angus Wilson, loved Hardy and Wordsworth. Her heart seems to lie with the past. As early as 1967, she was saying: 'I'd rather be at the end of a dying tradition, which I admire, than at the beginning of a tradition which I deplore.' Margaret Drabble was born just before the Second World War. Her father was a QC and a Labour candidate in the 1945 and 1950 elections. Her mother, Kathleen, who died 18 years ago, was a teacher and a depressive. She dominated her two daughters and her son. When she died, Byatt said it was as if the 'blue sky' had opened. Drabble, her mother's favourite, went to school in Sheffield until the age of 13, and then to the Quaker Mount School in York, which she loved. Always top of the class, just as Byatt was top of hers, she won a scholarship to Newnham, as Byatt had done before her, and left with a first-class degree. She says that at school she worked, but at university she 'played'. She did a lot of acting, apparently specialising in 'tragic heroines', alongside Ian McKellen, Derek Jacobi, Eleanor Bron and Clive Swift, whom she later married. After Cambridge, the two sisters' paths diverged, but not for long. Drabble, aged 23, married and she followed her husband to Stratford. Here, she had some minor roles, but during this period she thought of herself, bleakly, as 'just a wife'. She didn't know how to cook and she didn't know about contraception; nine-and-a-half months after the couple married, she was pregnant. She published her first novel, A Summer Birdcage, in 1962, on an advance of \u00a350. It came out a few months before Byatt's first novel and is about two sisters (sisters feature in both sisters' works - in Byatt's The Game, one sister kills another) and was an immediate success. The novels that followed, including The Garrick Year, The Millstone, Jerusalem the Golden, The Waterfall and The Needle's Eye, all examine what it is to be a woman in contemporary society. The female protagonists, however, are both modern and not: they are placed in an emphatically contemporary setting, but they all have nineteenth-century names (Rosamund, Clara, Emma, Lucy, Jane). They discuss classic literature with each other as often as mundane concerns. As the critic Elaine Showalter says, many of them eventually submit to female limitations. Children are the compensation for surrender. At the same time as she was bearing and looking after three children of her own, Drabble becomes the novelist of maternity and female boundaries. In 1975, Drabble and Swift divorced. By now, she was living in a large house in north-west London and was a successful novelist. She entered what critics called her 'Hampstead period', writing her trilogy - The Radiant Way, A Natural Curiosity, The Gates of Ivory - which followed the fortunes of three women friends through the social and political changes in Britain in the 1980s.

      "body": "<p>There is a problem with silver if you are trying to introduce it as part of a controlled colour theme in the garden. There are no silver flowers. Nature doesn't do silver petals. It mimics gold via yellow and does some good imitations of copper and bronze, but that silvery sheen, which you might think would be well suited to the satiny texture of many petals, simply is not found. When we started our Jewel-garden project, we thought that we could get round this by using suitable shades of white. But it doesn't work. White can, sort of, serve as diamond or, even diamant\u00e9. But if you are making a garden dedicated to jewels and our ill-spent 80s, then silver is a must. It is the setting. </p> <p>In fact, for silver you have to forget flowers and look to foliage and bark, hunting among the blues and greens. There is no silver foilage either, just shades of grey, at its most silvery when polished with moisture. This effect is not accidental. Many plants attain silveryness via tiny hairs on the surface of the leaves, which trap both light and moisture. So, as a general rule silvery, hairy leaves indicate a plant that is adapted to cope with drought. The most obvious examples of this are the felted leaves of Verbascums or Stachys byzantina. Of course, desert plants such as cacti use the opposite technique of having smooth, succulent leaves but also have that silvery bloom. </p> <p>Walking round the Jewel garden in mid-September, there is surprisingly little silver to be seen. I suppose that we could have incorporated water into the garden as a silver foil (ho! ho!) and there is an attractive logic to that, but it would have been quite a radical, expensive development. For the moment, all the silver must come from plants and the season has no use for silver's coolness or sophistication. This is a time of year when the colours tumble softly from their perch, richly jaded, and with none of the clean hardness of silver. There are the leaves of the weeping pear, Pyrus salicifolia 'Pendula', and the silvery blue stems of Knautia macedonica perfectly setting off its burgundy flowers. The leaves of the annual Salvia viridis - which has been fantastic this year - fade to a lavender-veined silver before turning into straw. Silver for just a week or so, but the phase adds much to balance the garden. The blue grasses, such as Festuca glauca and Miscanthus sinensis 'Morning Light', are still going strong, although to get a decent silver blue from the Festuca at this time of year, you must cut it back in early August. </p> <p> Miscanthus sinensis 'Silberfeder' has silver-pink plumes that look very good next to the plume poppy, Macleaya cordata. The blue oat grass, Helictotrichon sempervirens, has glaucous leaves and silvery plumes and is evergreen, so it lasts all year. 'Morning Light' is my favourite grass at the moment, with very long, languid leaves holding an exaggerated arch of grey-blue. Not silver at all really but, in this never-never land of the garden, it works well. </p> <p>There is a serious point here. You must use and judge colours in the garden in context and not by some objective colour wheel or household indicator. Evening light will always make colours seem richer and bring out the yellows, browns and reds, whereas morning light is cooler and best for pale colours. It follows that gardens which catch the morning sun will be inclined to be silvery and gardens that look best in the evening - which is the case with our Jewel garden - must use silver as more of a matte colour, an interval between other colours, rather than as an overall effect. Traditionally, silver is used to cool down and harmonise colours that would otherwise jar. Inevitably, silver foliage judiciously spaced out among the border will do this, but I like to think of it having a more positive role, focusing attention on itself rather than just being a neutral buffer. </p> <p>From early spring to early August cardoons do this with huge panache. Although most books simple refer to Cynara cardunculus as if it were the only type of cardoon, we have three quite distinct strains in the garden, one dwarfer than the other two, one with very deeply cut leaves and one with much wider, less cut and greyer leaves. The latter is planted as a separate long avenue, between pleached limes and underplanted with wallflowers, tulips and Allium giganteum. I like them best at the end of April, when the blood-red wallflowers contrast against the silvery grey of the cardoon leaves. We have more cardoons in the borders, although by now they are great, gaunt skeletons of their silvery selves, supported by posts and turning tawny. </p> <p>Another silver thistle that also needs support is the Onopordum acanthium, or Scotch thistle. Like the cardoon, it is a ghost of its former self and is so top heavy that it is best cut down now. Unlike the cardoon, it is biennial, and there are many young plants growing in the borders with rosettes of fresh, silver leaves. They are modest enough now to be moved to a suitable spacing at the back of a border, but if left until spring they will have developed tap roots and are less likely to survive transference. I would always want some Onopordums in my garden and in June they are top of the silver league, by far. </p> <p>Running a close second is the equally prickly, equally biennial Eryngium giganteum, or Miss Wilmott's Ghost. It got its vernacular name from Miss Wilmott's habit of dropping its seeds in every garden she visited. Miss Wilmott was from Essex, lived about 100 years ago, was very rich and sounds a bit of a pain. But it is a fantastic plant. All the Eryngium s are good, and we also have E. agavifolium, which is doing well but has a tendency to rot off. This is also true of E. bourgatii, which has vivid blue stems. I gave it lots of grit when planted, to mimic dry conditions. I also like the look of E. alpinum, which is the nearest thing to a silver flower that I have seen. </p> <p>Thinking about it, we could easily have an area of silver-blue leaves and white flowers. We tried white and green and it merely looked like a copy of Sissinghurst's white garden. No good - though the silver-blue would make the white pearly, and the foliage more silver. It also might temper the intensity of the existing planting and give it a cooler, more measured edge. We could have white tulips growing through the young Onopordums, or Artemisia 'Powis Castle' and then later add the Artemisa ludoviciana 'Valerie Finnis'. Shrubs such as Elaeagnus 'Quicksilver', Dusty Miller ( Senecio viravara ), or even Rosa glauca could be used, although we would have to cut the pink flowers off as they arrived. Seems a bit unkind. Certainly Tanacetum argenteum , the Dianthus 'Mrs Sinkins' and the white dead nettle Lamium maculatum 'White Nancy'. Yes to Salvia argentea and Ballota pseudodictamnus, although I don't know how much it would like our heavy clay. And so the game goes on. The real horticultural secret, to paraphrase the Incredible String Band, is to be a joyful player.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden </strong> </p> <p>We have had our winter supply of mushroom compost delivered. This is exciting for all sorts of reasons. First, there's the performance of getting it here via two big lorryloads driven across the water meadows, which is the only way to get anything larger than a barrow to the end of the garden. These could flood at any time and then access will be impossible - the ground freezes hard and doesn't get dry until summer. </p> <p>The compost makes one hell of a heap - 16-odd tons of lovely, jet-black, crumbly stuff. I would love to be able to say that we don't buy in anything and use just our own garden compost, but I guess that this delivery is as much as 20 times the finished compost we create each calendar year. We use it to dig into the vegetable garden - finding that it works better than anything to lighten and open out the soil - and to mulch the flower gardens. I keep the garden compost as a component of potting compost for mulching trees, hedges and shrubs, and for adding to planting holes.</p> <p>I turned the compost the other day, or rather did half a heap and then hurt my shoulder so, rather ignominiously, had to ask Gareth to finish the job while I pottered to the raspberries and pruned the summer ones. I love this job, cutting out all the old canes and thinning the new, tying them into a rhythmic row against the wires. I will give them a thick mulch after a decent amount of rain, but not with the mushroom compost, as it is too alkaline. Well-rotted cow manure would be ideal, as that is fairly acidic, but our garden compost will have to do.</p> <p>The raspberry prunings generate a lot of uncompostable canes and they go onto the heap to be shredded, along with the cardoon stems, artichokes, sweetcorn, summer-cabbage stems and masses of orache. When I last wrote about shredders, I received more mail than on any other subject - all of it saying how great shredders were. In principle I agree, but I have never used one that was robust or fast enough to be viable. Instead, we hire a commercial one every few months and have a day of it. I like having the piles of shredded stuff, mushroom compost, garden compost, grass from the orchard and leaf mould, all ordered and shipshape ready for winter. Then when the rain does finally come the ensuing mud will mean that it will be the end of wheelbarrows on the grass, let alone lorries across the field.</p> <p><strong>Your roots: Getting your garden ready for autumn </strong></p> <p>It is time to plant out wallflowers into their flowering positions so that they can grow and get established this autumn, ready to flower next spring. If any are straggly, pinch off the tops to make good, bushy plants. Keep busy with planting spring bulbs. I find this very tedious but it will pay handsome dividends next spring. </p> <p>Low light levels mean that tomato ripening has been very erratic and poor this summer. Any green tomatoes are unlikely to ripen now, so bring them in and store, on the vine, in a shed or in a drawer indoors. Many will ripen and the rest will make very good chutney. Or green- tomato soup.</p> <p>Check pears and apples daily, collecting windfalls and gently twisting fruit still on the tree to see if ready. Store unripe fruit on a window sill and ripe ones in a cool, airy, dark place.</p>",

We could have white tulips growing through the young Onopordums, or Artemisia 'Powis Castle' and then later add the Artemisa ludoviciana 'Valerie Finnis'. Shrubs such as Elaeagnus 'Quicksilver', Dusty Miller ( Senecio viravara ), or even Rosa glauca could be used, although we would have to cut the pink flowers off as they arrived. Seems a bit unkind. Certainly Tanacetum argenteum , the Dianthus 'Mrs Sinkins' and the white dead nettle Lamium maculatum 'White Nancy'. Yes to Salvia argentea and Ballota pseudodictamnus, although I don't know how much it would like our heavy clay. And so the game goes on. The real horticultural secret, to paraphrase the Incredible String Band, is to be a joyful player. My roots: A week in Monty's garden We have had our winter supply of mushroom compost delivered. This is exciting for all sorts of reasons. First, there's the performance of getting it here via two big lorryloads driven across the water meadows, which is the only way to get anything larger than a barrow to the end of the garden. These could flood at any time and then access will be impossible - the ground freezes hard and doesn't get dry until summer. The compost makes one hell of a heap - 16-odd tons of lovely, jet-black, crumbly stuff. I would love to be able to say that we don't buy in anything and use just our own garden compost, but I guess that this delivery is as much as 20 times the finished compost we create each calendar year. We use it to dig into the vegetable garden - finding that it works better than anything to lighten and open out the soil - and to mulch the flower gardens. I keep the garden compost as a component of potting compost for mulching trees, hedges and shrubs, and for adding to planting holes. I turned the compost the other day, or rather did half a heap and then hurt my shoulder so, rather ignominiously, had to ask Gareth to finish the job while I pottered to the raspberries and pruned the summer ones. I love this job, cutting out all the old canes and thinning the new, tying them into a rhythmic row against the wires. I will give them a thick mulch after a decent amount of rain, but not with the mushroom compost, as it is too alkaline. Well-rotted cow manure would be ideal, as that is fairly acidic, but our garden compost will have to do. The raspberry prunings generate a lot of uncompostable canes and they go onto the heap to be shredded, along with the cardoon stems, artichokes, sweetcorn, summer-cabbage stems and masses of orache. When I last wrote about shredders, I received more mail than on any other subject - all of it saying how great shredders were. In principle I agree, but I have never used one that was robust or fast enough to be viable. Instead, we hire a commercial one every few months and have a day of it. I like having the piles of shredded stuff, mushroom compost, garden compost, grass from the orchard and leaf mould, all ordered and shipshape ready for winter. Then when the rain does finally come the ensuing mud will mean that it will be the end of wheelbarrows on the grass, let alone lorries across the field. Your roots: Getting your garden ready for autumn It is time to plant out wallflowers into their flowering positions so that they can grow and get established this autumn, ready to flower next spring. If any are straggly, pinch off the tops to make good, bushy plants. Keep busy with planting spring bulbs. I find this very tedious but it will pay handsome dividends next spring. Low light levels mean that tomato ripening has been very erratic and poor this summer. Any green tomatoes are unlikely to ripen now, so bring them in and store, on the vine, in a shed or in a drawer indoors. Many will ripen and the rest will make very good chutney. Or green- tomato soup. Check pears and apples daily, collecting windfalls and gently twisting fruit still on the tree to see if ready. Store unripe fruit on a window sill and ripe ones in a cool, airy, dark place.",

The sharp-suited traders, banking goliaths and multinational corporations deal in trillions daily. </p> <p>But on this morning, 24 hours before the annual G7 summit in Prague, the dealers drew in their horns. Fearful of being caught short this week by central bank intervention to help the euro, sellers of the drowning currency were for once few and far between. </p> <p>On Wednesday, the euro had fallen to its lowest ebb, worth just 84.4 cents to the dollar. Barely 21 months after its launch, the totem of European union had lost 30 per cent of its value. But now, rare buying dragged the currency off the floor. By 11am it perked up a percentage point or two. It was the signal for the most concerted action to prop up a currency the world has seen since the Eighties. </p> <p>Shortly after midday, one by one the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Federal Reserve, Japan's Ministry of Finance and the Bank of England waded in on a euro-buying spree.

      "bodyText": "The scent of fear percolated the foreign exchange markets from dawn on Friday. The sharp-suited traders, banking goliaths and multinational corporations deal in trillions daily. But on this morning, 24 hours before the annual G7 summit in Prague, the dealers drew in their horns. Fearful of being caught short this week by central bank intervention to help the euro, sellers of the drowning currency were for once few and far between. On Wednesday, the euro had fallen to its lowest ebb, worth just 84.4 cents to the dollar. Barely 21 months after its launch, the totem of European union had lost 30 per cent of its value. But now, rare buying dragged the currency off the floor. By 11am it perked up a percentage point or two. It was the signal for the most concerted action to prop up a currency the world has seen since the Eighties. Shortly after midday, one by one the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Federal Reserve, Japan's Ministry of Finance and the Bank of England waded in on a euro-buying spree. The timing was textbook, catching the markets totally by surprise. The euro surged above 90 cents as, not to miss out, traders shouted 'buy, buy, buy'. 'To be effective, these operations have to be a surprise, a concerted and co-ordinated effort,' UK Treasury sources said. 'You need to have everyone, the ECB, the US and Japan all working together.' The sighting shot had already been fired a fortnight ago, when the ECB - headed by veteran Dutch banker Wim Duisenberg - sold 2.5 billion euros' worth of dollars and yen. But the battle lines hardened at the International Monetary Fund's annual gathering, also in Prague last week. The IMF, indeed, stirred things up early in the week when it pronounced intervention not to be 'taboo'. And Tony Blair was consulted before - at the Chancellor's behest - the soldiers of the Bank of England waded in to sell part of the UK's $42bn of currency reserves. On this battleground, one familiar enemy was entirely absent. Before Black Wednesday in 1992, hedge funds spearheaded by billionaire speculator George Soros picked off weaker European currencies one by one before turfing mighty sterling ignominiously out of the euro's precursor, the European exchange rate mechanism.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair may have had a tough time last week. But if he wants to know how much worse it could get, he should look across the North Sea to Denmark. There, his opposite number Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is fighting for his life over the defining issue of the age still clouding the UK horizon - Europe and, more specifically, its single currency. </p> <p>It is not just Rasmussen whose credibility is at stake. Employer and union leaders have together invested significant time and money in trying to persuade their people to accept something about which they are famously sceptical. </p> <p>The Danes are making them sweat. Daily Gallup polls published by the Berlingske Tidende newspaper ahead of this week's referendum on adopting the euro resemble a jagged pair of scissors - with Yes voters pointing down, and an eight point gap with the ascendant nay-sayers. </p> <p>The outcome of Thursday's plebiscite has profound consequences for the shape and direction of the European project. A No vote could not only knock the credibility of the juddering currency further; it will also make negative results in future referendums, due in Sweden as well as in Britain, far more likely. </p> <p>This would throw the heart of the project into doubt just as it is moving from consolidation to expansion. And it could place a new economic and political curtain between the far north-east of Europe and the teutonic mainland. </p> <p>But the notoriously independent Danes take a delicious pleasure in watching their leaders writhe. </p> <p>From the island-capital Copenhagen to the remote industrial towns of Jutland, 'Ja' and 'Nej' voters alike reserve their scorn for Rasmussen, their employers and the unions. </p> <p>Poul Nyrup has blundered, they say. The beleaguered yes coalition is 'ridiculous', 'panic-stricken', 'pathetic'. </p> <p>For business and unions, the situation could not be worse. Jorgen Hansen, deputy director-general of the employers' group Dansk Industri, says: 'It is important we get a Yes. In Denmark we have almost 100 per cent support for the euro among both big and small business. The unions are the same.' </p> <p>For their part, unions have warned of 35,000 job losses if there is a No. That represents 1.5 per cent of the workforce. </p> <p>But while industrial leaders may be convinced, their employees - particularly female workers and those in the public sector - are not. 'As we learnt in the 1992 referendum on Maastricht, they are suspicious of the elite,' says Hansen. </p> <p>The pro-euro coalition has been using its impeccable network to fight back. Rasmussen has been invited by companies far and wide to meet Denmark's workers and put the case for the single currency. </p> <p>On Tuesday morning, for example, he was speaking in an industrial estate in the Copenhagen suburb of Brondby, home to Denmark's stock market star, NKT holdings. </p> <p>This is the kind of business politicians like to be connected with. Founded in the nineteenth century, NKT now employs 6,500 people and is Denmark's foremost provider of telecommunications. Its shares rose 600 per cent after it spun off a chip designer to Intel earlier this year for $1.25 billion. </p> <p>Managing director Tom Knutzen represents the views of the frustrated majority of Europhile businessmen who are desperate to see a Yes vote on Thursday. 'This morning the Prime Minister in person was extremely dedicated and strongly believed in his arguments,' he says. 'In the Danish press it has been more difficult.' </p> <p>Similar concerns are found away from the Copenhagen media mel\u00e9e. Grundfos has been making domestic and industrial pumps in the town of Bjerringbro in Jutland since 1945, and now has about 10 per cent of the global market. </p> <p>This is another Danish success story. Investment has made the huge factories which dominate Bjerringbro - including an inhouse chip plant - into some of the most highly automated and modern facilities in Denmark. Rasmussen has taken his roadshow there too. </p> <p>Executive vice president Jens Jorgen Madsen says: 'We can't imagine that anyone can dream of saying No to the euro.' But he adds: 'The campaigning and debate have been at an ignorant level.' </p> <p>NKT and Grundfos have similar economic and commercial reasons for wanting to join - some of which will be familiar to UK businessmen: lower transaction costs, ease of trading, the attraction for domestic and inward investment. NKT does some 50 per cent of its business in the euro zone; for Grundfos the figure is 60 per cent. </p> <p>Madsen says: 'We do most of our trade there. We simply cannot understand how it would be better to be outside.' </p> <p>But they also point to specifically Danish factors - chief of which is that since 1982 the Danish krone has been linked first to the deutschmark and now to the euro. </p> <p>Hansen says this means there are major disadvantages to staying out: 'We must follow what the ECB does. But we have no influence at the committees.' </p> <p>And, as Knutzen points out, Danish businesses and taxpayers have to put up with higher debt costs while the krone is outside the euro. Base rates are half a percentage point higher than the ECB's. 'You will always pay a premium while you are outside.' </p> <p>Knutzen estimates that NKT is losing between DKr10 million and DKr20m a year by being 'out'. Grundfos calculates the figure at DKr10m a year for every percentage point above the ECB rate. </p> <p>Rasmussen has attempted to raise the stakes on the currency front. Speculators are ready to pounce on the DKr if it is 'weakened' by a No vote; Denmark has spent DKr10 billion defending the currency as the Yes campaign has lost ground. </p> <p>The difficulty is that, worrying as these problems are, raising them invites accusations of scaremongering. </p> <p>Analysts and economists point out that while in the short term there may be a base-rate hike of 100 points if Denmark stays out, the long-term differences are unlikely to be great - certainly not as great as in 1992. The effect on the level of the euro is less certain, as US and Japanese central banks intervened on Friday to defend it. </p> <p>The ascendant No campaign bridges left and right. </p> <p>Niels Meyer, a professor of physics and spokesman for the leftish June movement, says: 'Because we have referendums, the Danish people are very well informed. They remember the arguments from 1992 and leaders overstating economic problems. People can see that economic arguments are not the real concern.' </p> <p>Here Denmark diverges further from the UK. Current UK debate focuses on economic problems - manufacturing jobs and inward investment - reflecting the fortunes of sterling floating against the euro. </p> <p>But the Danes' first priority is democracy, says Meyer. 'The idea of a united states of Europe is something the Danes do not want. They believe the euro will be a quantum leap towards that.' </p> <p>Their second is welfare: 'The Nordic countries have high taxes, welfare and pensions. The rest of the EU has insurance, lower benefits, and lower taxes. With EU harmonisation, Denmark faces lower welfare and smaller pensions.' </p> <p>This sounds plausible, and it has whipped up a storm. Many believe the No campaign is on weak ground - but this is insignificant next to the mess Rasmussen has made of it. First he sought a deal with his coalition allies - the Conservatives and the liberal Venstre party - then he demanded that all EU governments guarantee that there would be no adverse effect on pensions. Panic, shouted his foes. </p> <p>Even Anders Jensen of the pro-euro European Movement says: 'Rasmussen badly overreacted to the pensions issue.' </p> <p>Jensen also admits the supremacy of political arguments. Back in March, when the referendum was declared, a report by the Danish Independent Economic Council - dubbed the Danish Wise Men - found that the economic benefits of membership were negligible. He believes this is wrong. </p> <p>At the same time, fears about loss of sovereignty were heightened by the EU sanctions imposed on Austria after the election win of far-right politician J\u00f6rg Haider. Danes were outraged at the breach of sovereignty. </p> <p>Jensen says: 'There is a balance between the economic gain of entry and the political cost. The Wise Men said there was little gain; the Austrian situation pointed to a great loss.' The polls have criss-crossed ever since. </p> <p>Now, with the vote closing fast, even businessmen concede it is the political issues that are commanding attention. </p> <p>Knutzen says: 'Europe has a history of war, both military and economic. The euro is an answer to the economic warfare of competitive devaluation and so on. It is an attempt to harmonise economic activity and economic growth.' </p> <p>But opponents can use these arguments, too. </p> <p>Sceptical businessman Kresten Bjerre, who runs an internet service provider, says: 'When countries like Greece, France, Spain, Italy and Ireland get together, is it going to be stable? Who knows. I say wait and see.' </p> <p>Looking back on the campaign, Grundfos ruefully admits: 'The Nos have used dirty tricks, like the pensions issue.' </p> <p>The pro-euro Jensen puts it differently: 'Our arguments are difficult to make, because they sometimes do not seem logical - even though they are true. The Nos are on easier rhetorical ground. As they say, the Devil has all the best tunes.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, out on the streets, the Danes are dancing merrily while the music lasts. As we have learnt in the past two weeks, the British would enjoy such an opportunity too.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Not very long ago, William Aikens, a former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, said: 'When the oil price rises above $30 a barrel, Saddam Hussein will be treated like Mother Teresa.' His statement sums up the indisputable connection between petroleum price, Iraq (possessing the second-largest oil reserves in the world) and Washington's policy towards Saddam. </p> <p>With Iraq producing 3.6 million barrels per day (bpd), its highest output ever, the removal of a United Nations' ceiling on its petroleum sales in January, and American oil corporations buying up a third of its oil exports, Saddam has become a major player in the market. </p> <p>This was acknowledged implicitly by America when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced recently that Washington would not use force to compel Iraq to accept inspectors of the newly formed UN Monitoring and Ongoing Verification and Inspection Commission (Unmovic). She then joined the UN ambassadors of Russia, France and China in urging Unmovic chief, Hans Blix, not to force the issue. </p> <p>This has enabled Saddam to become active, rather than reactive, in his foreign affairs. Hence his recent claim that by carrying out horizontal drilling near the Kuwait-Iraq border, Kuwait was stealing 300,000 barrels per day of Iraqi petroleum. </p> <p>Hence, too, his letter to the UN Security Council holding Saudi Arabia responsible for the losses that Baghdad suffered when Riyadh closed the oil pipeline from southern Iraq to the Saudi Red Sea port of Yanbo in August 1990. </p> <p>Saddam's aim in putting Kuwait and Saudi Arabia - big petroleum producers - on the defensive is to destabilise the oil market and spike up the price. He knows well how tight the current world petroleum market is - thanks chiefly to thriving economies all around the globe - and how vulnerable the US is on the issue of oil imports. </p> <p>Today 60 per cent of the 19 million barrels of oil Americans consume daily comes from abroad, double the levels seen in 1983. And the trend is set to continue. </p> <p>In the Nineties, oil output in the US declined by 15 per cent, while consumption rose by 11 per cent. With less than 5 per cent of the world population, America consumes 25 per cent of world oil output. It sucks up all the petroleum exports of Canada, Mexico and Venezuela. And it is becoming increasingly dependent on imports from the Gulf region, including Iraq. </p> <p>As soon as Iraq accepted the UN-administered oil-for-food scheme in December 1996, allowing it to sell $2 billion worth of petroleum in six months to buy food and medicine, Washington let it be known that US companies were free to buy Iraqi oil. </p> <p>And they did - for two years. Then, enraged by Operation Desert Fox, the Penta gon's 100-hour blitzkrieg against Iraq in mid-December 1998, Saddam ordered that no Iraqi oil be sold to American companies. </p> <p>But that did not happen. Indeed, according to the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, Iraq emerged as the fastest-growing source of US petroleum imports in 1999. </p> <p>US companies bought about a third of their Iraqi oil imports through foreign intermediaries. Their tankers loaded the commodity at an Iraqi oil terminal and sailed directly to American ports, often in the Gulf of Mexico. </p> <p>'The Chevrons and the Exxons of this world have to buy [Iraqi oil] from the Russians, the French and the Chinese traders,' said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. </p> <p>Saddam is well aware of the shipment of Iraqi oil directly to the US. 'That doesn't bother him,' said Vahe Petrossian, a London-based oil expert. 'By banning direct sales to American companies, Saddam deprived them of their trading profits. These now go to the middlemen from countries friendly with Baghdad - Russia, France and China.' </p> <p>Part of the reason for US corporations seeking out Iraqi crude is that an American law prohibits them from purchasing oil from Iran, Opec's second largest producer, whose output is on a par with Iraq's. </p> <p>All this is part of Washington's Dual Containment pol icy towards Tehran and Baghdad, adopted in May 1993. But the policy has been in tatters for the past four years, a fact the Clinton administration refuses to recognise. </p> <p>When it comes to repairing Iraq' rundown petroleum industry, the European subsidiaries of US oil equipment firms are in the forefront. Since mid-1998, making bids through their foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, more than a dozen US corporations have signed tens of millions of dollars'-worth of contracts with Iraq for oil-producing equipment . </p> <p>With the UN allowing Iraq to spend an average of $100m a month on repairing its petroleum industry, the pickings are rich. </p> <p>In July, Unmovic announced with much fanfare that its 44 inspectors from 19 countries were to take a month-long training course at New York's Columbia University to familiarise themselves with the historical, legal, administrative and political aspects of inspections and monitoring, and to become 'sensitive' to Iraqi culture. </p> <p>The snag is that Iraq has refused to accept last December's UN Security Council Resolution 1284, setting up Unmovic. So when Unmovic boss Blix said in August that a small team of his inspectors were ready to go to Iraq, his progress report was received with embarrassment rather than enthusiasm by the US. Half of the Unmovic inspectors have returned home. </p> <p>In the words of Henry Kissinger, a former US Secretary of State: 'Countries do not have friends or foes; they have interests.' And no interest is higher or more important in America than to keep gas-guzzling cars running, and homes and offices heated in winter. </p> <p>If that requires supping with the devil - renamed Saddam - so be it. </p> <p><strong>Rolling out the barrels: the supply chain</strong></p> <p><strong> Crude</strong> <br> When the price of oil was only $10 a barrel, in early 1998, Opec countries dependent on foreign earnings tried to bump it up to around $20 by cutting production to 2.6 million barrels a day in March and June. Nothing happened. They tried again with a 1.7 million cut in March: the price soared to $30 early this year. </p> <p>US pressure and concern that high prices were not in Opec's interest led to three production increases this year - 1.7 million barrels a day in March, 700,000 in June and 800,000 in September. But the price has not budged, because: </p> <p>\u0095 The shambolic quota system is inexact and often broken by Opec members. </p> <p>\u0095 Demand for oil is rising. </p> <p>\u0095 Crude is only one link in a complicated oil supply chain. </p> <p><strong> Shipping</strong> <br>The next link is shipping crude to market. The price charged by tanker owners to do this had gone up from $17,000 a day in September last year to $73,000 a day last month, says shipping broker Clarkson. This has raised shipping costs per barrel from around 60 cents to $2.60. The rise has been driven by a rebound after the Asian crisis, the scrapping of ships and demand for safer double-hulled vessels. </p> <p><strong> Refining</strong> <br>Next comes refining crude into products from petrol to heating oil. Refiners in Europe and the US were running below capacity last January. Now they are almost flat out, according to the Centre for Global Energy Studies. But as they have raised capacity, demand has risen, too. In the spring, US petrol stocks were down to 25 days. A massive rise in capacity had failed to lift that beyond 23 days by August. The result: higher prices at the pumps. The petrol problem is at last receding, only to be replaced by a similar difficulty over winter heating oil. </p> <p>\u0095 Dilip Hiro is the author of 'Dictionary of the Middle East', published by Macmillan, price \u00a320.</p>",

Their tankers loaded the commodity at an Iraqi oil terminal and sailed directly to American ports, often in the Gulf of Mexico. 'The Chevrons and the Exxons of this world have to buy [Iraqi oil] from the Russians, the French and the Chinese traders,' said Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. Saddam is well aware of the shipment of Iraqi oil directly to the US. 'That doesn't bother him,' said Vahe Petrossian, a London-based oil expert. 'By banning direct sales to American companies, Saddam deprived them of their trading profits. These now go to the middlemen from countries friendly with Baghdad - Russia, France and China.' Part of the reason for US corporations seeking out Iraqi crude is that an American law prohibits them from purchasing oil from Iran, Opec's second largest producer, whose output is on a par with Iraq's. All this is part of Washington's Dual Containment pol icy towards Tehran and Baghdad, adopted in May 1993. But the policy has been in tatters for the past four years, a fact the Clinton administration refuses to recognise. When it comes to repairing Iraq' rundown petroleum industry, the European subsidiaries of US oil equipment firms are in the forefront. Since mid-1998, making bids through their foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, more than a dozen US corporations have signed tens of millions of dollars'-worth of contracts with Iraq for oil-producing equipment . With the UN allowing Iraq to spend an average of $100m a month on repairing its petroleum industry, the pickings are rich. In July, Unmovic announced with much fanfare that its 44 inspectors from 19 countries were to take a month-long training course at New York's Columbia University to familiarise themselves with the historical, legal, administrative and political aspects of inspections and monitoring, and to become 'sensitive' to Iraqi culture. The snag is that Iraq has refused to accept last December's UN Security Council Resolution 1284, setting up Unmovic. So when Unmovic boss Blix said in August that a small team of his inspectors were ready to go to Iraq, his progress report was received with embarrassment rather than enthusiasm by the US. Half of the Unmovic inspectors have returned home. In the words of Henry Kissinger, a former US Secretary of State: 'Countries do not have friends or foes; they have interests.' And no interest is higher or more important in America than to keep gas-guzzling cars running, and homes and offices heated in winter. If that requires supping with the devil - renamed Saddam - so be it. Rolling out the barrels: the supply chain Crude When the price of oil was only $10 a barrel, in early 1998, Opec countries dependent on foreign earnings tried to bump it up to around $20 by cutting production to 2.6 million barrels a day in March and June. Nothing happened. They tried again with a 1.7 million cut in March: the price soared to $30 early this year. US pressure and concern that high prices were not in Opec's interest led to three production increases this year - 1.7 million barrels a day in March, 700,000 in June and 800,000 in September. But the price has not budged, because: \u0095 The shambolic quota system is inexact and often broken by Opec members. \u0095 Demand for oil is rising. \u0095 Crude is only one link in a complicated oil supply chain. Shipping The next link is shipping crude to market. The price charged by tanker owners to do this had gone up from $17,000 a day in September last year to $73,000 a day last month, says shipping broker Clarkson. This has raised shipping costs per barrel from around 60 cents to $2.60. The rise has been driven by a rebound after the Asian crisis, the scrapping of ships and demand for safer double-hulled vessels. Refining Next comes refining crude into products from petrol to heating oil. Refiners in Europe and the US were running below capacity last January. Now they are almost flat out, according to the Centre for Global Energy Studies. But as they have raised capacity, demand has risen, too. In the spring, US petrol stocks were down to 25 days. A massive rise in capacity had failed to lift that beyond 23 days by August. The result: higher prices at the pumps. The petrol problem is at last receding, only to be replaced by a similar difficulty over winter heating oil. \u0095 Dilip Hiro is the author of 'Dictionary of the Middle East', published by Macmillan, price \u00a320.",

      "body": "<p>An international game of pass the parcel is emerging this weekend about who or what is to blame for the high oil price and what action, if any, could make it fall. </p> <p>Fears about the high cost of oil and its downstream derivatives are driving a high-stakes game of geopolitics, involving the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the US presidential elections, and futures market traders in New York and London. Black gold is high on the agenda in Prague for worried leaders at the G7 summit of industrialised nations. </p> <p>In the US a combination of economic and political effects led to the unprecedented release of oil reserves by President Bill Clinton. </p> <p>The wild card in the pack is this week's Opec heads of state meeting in Caracas - only the second such gathering in the organisation's history. The timing could not be better, coming as the cartel thrusts itself back on to the world stage from the brink of irrelevance, and in the immediate wake of the US's intervention. </p> <p>So what can make oil cheaper? Not surprisingly, it depends who you ask: it's Opec or it's extra refining capacity; it's a matter of using strategic reserves, or a question of rectifying the irrational exuberance of futures markets. </p> <p>In Prague the heads of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are fret ting at the prospect of oil shaving fractions of percentage points off world growth, and boosting inflation. The double-headed hydra of high oil prices affecting economies in the long term and voters in the short term was largely unforeseen. The French government is using the G7 meeting to propose an informal summit between the European Union, the US and the oil-producing countries. </p> <p>In the US, oil has become a political issue because of the high prices and because the Republican presidential running mates, George W Bush and Dick Cheney, have strong connections with 'Big Oil'. It was Al Gore, the Democrat candidate, who stirred the pot by getting Clinton to release some of the US's strategic reserve of 571 million barrels. </p> <p>Similar moves from the other G7 nations are now possible. In emergencies a mechanism exists through the International Energy Agency, the energy market watchdog of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, to release portions of the agency's reserve of about 1.2bn barrels. This oil was last used in the Gulf War, and was on standby for millennium computer bug problems. </p> <p>IEA countries could decide to make a co-ordinated intervention to dampen down speculative hysteria. But the notion of high prices as an 'emergency' is unprecedented. For now, efforts are concentrated on the more traditional channels of polite diplomacy to secure a production increase from Opec. </p> <p>William Ramsay, deputy executive director of the IEA, said: 'Frankly, Opec have not shared their agenda with us, though one of the clearest reasons may be to celebrate 40 years of existence.' </p> <p>The world leaders in Prague may be worried, but the Opec guests in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, will be ebullient. The city has been given an extra lick of paint. In the run-up to the summit, a three-month cultural festival featuring Opec member states' work included Kuwaiti art exhibitions and demonstrations of Venezuelan basketry. The meeting is the high point of a process of Opec reconstruction, largely propelled by the feisty Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez. </p> <p>He travelled around the Middle East to deliver personal invitations to the conference, promising to visit Saddam Hussein even if he had to go to Iraq by camel or skateboard. Saddam and Libya's Colonel Gadaffi declined their invitations on security grounds, but the trip and the rhetoric surrounding it caught the eye of oil markets mindful of a possible return of the oil militancy of the mid-Seventies. </p> <p>However, Opec insiders say this should not be seen as a return to the sabre-rattling of that era. 'If Opec then could be considered a rebellious teenager,' its general secretary, Dr Rilwanu Lukman, said last week, 'I am happy to say that now, as its fortieth birthday nears, the organisation has gained the maturity that comes with age.' </p> <p>Opec will attempt to forge stronger links with other oil-producing nations, such as Mexico and Russia. Norway, which is a member of the IEA but has followed Opec output price trends in the past has sent an observer to Caracas. Senior analysts suggest Opec may achieve the spectacular diplomatic coup of admitting Russia to the cartel. </p> <p>If the heads of state really do want to make a difference beyond the diplomatic pomp and circumstance of the summit, they will find the scale and timing of any intervention in the market very difficult to judge. </p> <p>Opec members are notoriously bad at breaking quotas. It is also difficult to tell how other elements in the supply chain, from shipping costs and refining capacity to final demand for oil products, will play out. On top of this, oil markets - including Nymex in New York and London's International Petroleum exchange - are hard to read. Any production rise aimed at pushing the price into the band favoured by economists, Opec and consumers - between $22 and \u00a328 a barrel - is liable to cause a crash. </p> <p>'Opec has increased production this year much more than necessary,' Chavez told Venezuelans on TV last week. </p> <p>He said suggestions that Opec could increase production by 2.2 million barrels per day were exaggerated: the cartel was already producing in excess of world demand. Opec says the high price is not a result of a an oil shortage, but a lack of refinery capacity and futures market speculation. </p> <p>Refineries across the industrialised world are running flat out. Some have been doing so for months, and will have to shut for maintenance in October. If this is the bottleneck, increasing production of crude, or releasing reserves, may ease crude prices in the short term, but it is unlikely to cut the retail cost of petrol and heating oil. </p> <p>The IEA is not convinced. 'The numbers being put around - that Opec took 4 million barrels off the market, have put 3 million back in, and in the meantime demand has increased production by 2 million barrels - speak for themselves. I don't think you can explain the fragility in today's market by futures trading,' says Ramsay. </p> <p>The key to understanding where oil prices may be heading lies in the dark world of the futures markets. The oil market is distorted in such a way that it doesn't pay to store oil. Oil companies, refineries and speculators can make profits by running down their stocks and buying cheaper future supplies. This arises partly because of the uncertain intentions of the global oil market players, from Opec to governments and oil companies. </p> <p>The oil markets are, to use the jargon, 'backwardated'.

      "bodyText": "An international game of pass the parcel is emerging this weekend about who or what is to blame for the high oil price and what action, if any, could make it fall. Fears about the high cost of oil and its downstream derivatives are driving a high-stakes game of geopolitics, involving the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, the US presidential elections, and futures market traders in New York and London. Black gold is high on the agenda in Prague for worried leaders at the G7 summit of industrialised nations. In the US a combination of economic and political effects led to the unprecedented release of oil reserves by President Bill Clinton. The wild card in the pack is this week's Opec heads of state meeting in Caracas - only the second such gathering in the organisation's history. The timing could not be better, coming as the cartel thrusts itself back on to the world stage from the brink of irrelevance, and in the immediate wake of the US's intervention. So what can make oil cheaper? Not surprisingly, it depends who you ask: it's Opec or it's extra refining capacity; it's a matter of using strategic reserves, or a question of rectifying the irrational exuberance of futures markets. In Prague the heads of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are fret ting at the prospect of oil shaving fractions of percentage points off world growth, and boosting inflation. The double-headed hydra of high oil prices affecting economies in the long term and voters in the short term was largely unforeseen. The French government is using the G7 meeting to propose an informal summit between the European Union, the US and the oil-producing countries. In the US, oil has become a political issue because of the high prices and because the Republican presidential running mates, George W Bush and Dick Cheney, have strong connections with 'Big Oil'. It was Al Gore, the Democrat candidate, who stirred the pot by getting Clinton to release some of the US's strategic reserve of 571 million barrels. Similar moves from the other G7 nations are now possible. In emergencies a mechanism exists through the International Energy Agency, the energy market watchdog of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, to release portions of the agency's reserve of about 1.2bn barrels. This oil was last used in the Gulf War, and was on standby for millennium computer bug problems. IEA countries could decide to make a co-ordinated intervention to dampen down speculative hysteria. But the notion of high prices as an 'emergency' is unprecedented. For now, efforts are concentrated on the more traditional channels of polite diplomacy to secure a production increase from Opec. William Ramsay, deputy executive director of the IEA, said: 'Frankly, Opec have not shared their agenda with us, though one of the clearest reasons may be to celebrate 40 years of existence.' The world leaders in Prague may be worried, but the Opec guests in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, will be ebullient. The city has been given an extra lick of paint. In the run-up to the summit, a three-month cultural festival featuring Opec member states' work included Kuwaiti art exhibitions and demonstrations of Venezuelan basketry. The meeting is the high point of a process of Opec reconstruction, largely propelled by the feisty Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez. He travelled around the Middle East to deliver personal invitations to the conference, promising to visit Saddam Hussein even if he had to go to Iraq by camel or skateboard. Saddam and Libya's Colonel Gadaffi declined their invitations on security grounds, but the trip and the rhetoric surrounding it caught the eye of oil markets mindful of a possible return of the oil militancy of the mid-Seventies. However, Opec insiders say this should not be seen as a return to the sabre-rattling of that era. 'If Opec then could be considered a rebellious teenager,' its general secretary, Dr Rilwanu Lukman, said last week, 'I am happy to say that now, as its fortieth birthday nears, the organisation has gained the maturity that comes with age.' Opec will attempt to forge stronger links with other oil-producing nations, such as Mexico and Russia. Norway, which is a member of the IEA but has followed Opec output price trends in the past has sent an observer to Caracas. Senior analysts suggest Opec may achieve the spectacular diplomatic coup of admitting Russia to the cartel. If the heads of state really do want to make a difference beyond the diplomatic pomp and circumstance of the summit, they will find the scale and timing of any intervention in the market very difficult to judge. Opec members are notoriously bad at breaking quotas. It is also difficult to tell how other elements in the supply chain, from shipping costs and refining capacity to final demand for oil products, will play out. On top of this, oil markets - including Nymex in New York and London's International Petroleum exchange - are hard to read. Any production rise aimed at pushing the price into the band favoured by economists, Opec and consumers - between $22 and \u00a328 a barrel - is liable to cause a crash. 'Opec has increased production this year much more than necessary,' Chavez told Venezuelans on TV last week. He said suggestions that Opec could increase production by 2.2 million barrels per day were exaggerated: the cartel was already producing in excess of world demand. Opec says the high price is not a result of a an oil shortage, but a lack of refinery capacity and futures market speculation. Refineries across the industrialised world are running flat out. Some have been doing so for months, and will have to shut for maintenance in October. If this is the bottleneck, increasing production of crude, or releasing reserves, may ease crude prices in the short term, but it is unlikely to cut the retail cost of petrol and heating oil. The IEA is not convinced. 'The numbers being put around - that Opec took 4 million barrels off the market, have put 3 million back in, and in the meantime demand has increased production by 2 million barrels - speak for themselves. I don't think you can explain the fragility in today's market by futures trading,' says Ramsay. The key to understanding where oil prices may be heading lies in the dark world of the futures markets. The oil market is distorted in such a way that it doesn't pay to store oil. Oil companies, refineries and speculators can make profits by running down their stocks and buying cheaper future supplies. This arises partly because of the uncertain intentions of the global oil market players, from Opec to governments and oil companies. The oil markets are, to use the jargon, 'backwardated'. This means speculators believe supply increases by Opec and changes in global demand will eventually come into balance, bringing the price of oil down from their present dizzy levels. As a result oil on the futures market is cheaper than the current or 'spot' price. If the Opec heads of state make any increase in production, it will have to be finely judged. Analysts believe that to bring the price down, any rise will have to be significant - more than a million barrels per day on top of the 800,000 rise announced earlier this month. However, such an increase is likely to produce a shock similar in scale to that following the March 1999 1.7 million cut, which triggered a massive oil price rise. But this time, of course, prices would slump. That would reverse the current 'backwardated' market, and create conditions of 'contango', where massive current supply puts the spot price below the futures price. Leo Drollas of the Centre for Global Energy Studies says: 'It is highly likely that we will reach contango soon: we will be awash with crude and the spot price will collapse. If I could say when that was I'd be in Monte Carlo. But I'd say it's likely in the first quarter of next year.' Robert Mabro, of the Oxford Institute for Energy studies, says: 'Unfortunately it seems that an oil shock is the only method of correcting these extreme prices, so you bounce back and forth from $10 to $33.' The likelihood of oil price ping-pong prevents Opec from making any production response that will have an impact on the market. In these conditions, a more likely cause of a significant fall in the price is smaller-than-expected demand caused by an exceptionally mild winter. A harsher winter, with everything else equal, will keep the market 'backwardated' and the price high. Industry analysts believe Clinton's intervention could backfire. Refineries will look for every means possible to sell crude from the reserve on the spot market and buy futures - undermining the effect of the reserve oil on product prices. Whether they succeed depends on the price at which the reserve is released, and how effective the US government is at policing abuse. 'Refiners are clever,' said one analyst. 'They'll always find a way to beat the system.' There is also a risk that Opec might reverse some of the production increases in response to the unprecedented release of reserves.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair will today issue his first public expression of regret over the Dome fiasco at the start of a week during which he will seek to restore confidence in his battered Government. His move comes as a fresh opinion poll shows that support for the Labour Party has slumped to its lowest level since its wilderness years of the Eighties. The Prime Minister is expected to use an appearance on this morning's Breakfast with Frost on BBC1 to admit that the Dome has flopped and that the \u00a31 billion of Lottery money needed to bail it out has caused high levels of public anger. He hopes that by 'lancing the Dome boil' at the start of the Labour Party conference, which begins today, he can then concentrate on a major relaunch of the Government battered by furious rows over fuel taxes and pensions and undermined by allegations, hotly denied, that the Chancellor lied during the Bernie Ecclestone affair. Blair has told key aides he wants to make it clear that the Government is listening to the concerns of the public but will not be deflected from its path. He will concentrate in his speech on Tuesday on 'the fundamentals' - health, education and crime. 'We acknowledge that [the Dome] has not been the runaway success people had hoped for,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said yesterday in a marked departure from earlier statements from the Prime Minister that the Dome would be 'fantastic' and a create the 'right mood' for New Labour. 'I think he [the Prime Minister] feels that with these sort of big, big projects there is a lesson to be learnt that they take a while to settle down,' his official spokesman added, saying the example of EuroDisney in Paris showed that it could take two years for big new attractions to take off. In a sign of its increasingly public disenchantment with the Dome, Downing Street last week failed to challenge two Ministers, Clare Short and Chris Smith, after they criticised the project. The new poll, for Channel 4 News, puts support for Labour at 32 per cent, eight points behind the Conservatives at 40 per cent. The Liberal Democrats are at 22 per cent. 'This poll will come as a particular shock to Labour, not just because of the size of the Tory lead but because Labour's support has continued to haemorrhage,' said polling expert Peter Kellner. 'Previous polls showing the Tories up to five points ahead had been conducted when petrol stations were closed. This one was conducted between Thursday and yesterday, when supplies were virtually back to normal. Labour strategists had hoped public opinion would be beginning to return Labour's way. Instead, the Tories have consolidated their lead.' The NOP poll, which shows that the Conservatives have added three per cent to their lead over Labour in the past week, says 76 per cent consider Blair to be 'arrogant', 62 per cent 'out of touch', 47 per cent 'incompetent' and 43 per cent 'weak'. Only 16 per cent say that he was someone who listened to the concerns of the public. Even as Blair tries to draw a line under the Dome crisis, it emerged last night that Lord Falconer, the Dome supremo, would have been personally liable to creditors if they sued the New Millennium Experience Company for trading while insolvent. The Observer has established that Falconer, who claims to be merely the sole shareholder in the Dome and therefore not intimately involved with the NMEC board's decisions - thus distancing himself from potential creditors' claims - made a number of key decisions on the Greenwich project. Under instruction from his advisers, he decided not to proceed with two bids for the Greenwich site made at the start of this year. In March, Nomura offered around \u00a375 million in cash as an opening bid. Prior to this, Legacy, which wants to turn the site into a science park, asked to enter into exclusive talks. Falconer's decision not to examine the two bids provides powerful evidence that he was acting as a shadow director of the NMEC - a person whose views influenced the way the NMEC board acted and would have therefore been personally liable to the Dome's creditors if the Millennium Commission had not bailed the project out during the past two months. Yesterday, a spokeswoman for the Minister said: 'Lord Falconer has not and never has been a member of the NMEC board, nor has acted as a director. He is a single shareholder on behalf of the Government.'",

      "bodyText": "Labour's attempts to fend off a pensions revolt suffered a fresh blow yesterday as a poll revealed overwhelming backing for a rise for all pensioners. More than 90 per cent of the public want a substantial increase in the universal basic state pension, according to the survey for Age Concern and the Transport &amp; General Workers' Union. The findings show Chancellor Gordon Brown's strategy of targeting help at the poorest pensioners, rather than all OAPs regardless of income, has not so far convinced the public. They come amid frantic attempts to avert defeat for the leadership at Labour's annual conference this week. The GMB and T&amp;G unions are now ready to drop demands to link pensions with earnings. But they want a rise in the basic pension. And although the Chancellor has hinted in private that he will be generous in the Budget, he is refusing to give specific details. 'The unions want numbers, and they won't get them,' said one government source. Meanwhile, a second potential headache is looming over vouchers for asylum seekers, which have replaced cash handouts to buy food and basic goods. Bill Morris, the T&amp;G leader, has tabled a motion demanding their abolition. He will argue they stigmatise refugees and could incite racist violence. Morris, appalled by seeing asylum seekers forced to queue separately to spend their weekly \u00a326.34 and being refused change, is threatening to release a dossier of evidence backing his case, including private advice from civil servants. While both issues arouse strong feelings among delegates, pensions are more significant electorally. Tony Blair and Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott will try to soothe ruffled feathers at a trade union liaison committee dinner tonight in Brighton. But the crucial negotiations are expected to take place tomorrow, particularly with Morris, who is privately anxious not to kick the Government when it is down. The NEC, Labour's ruling body, will meet tomorrow but its statement is unlikely to produce any new commitments on pensions. Government offers on the table include hiking the so-called minimum income guarantee - made up of basic state pension plus a means-tested top-up for the worst off - or adjusting thresholds at which pensioners become eligible for the extra help. Brown and social security secretary Alistair Darling believe an important principle is at stake. Treasury sources insisted the Chancellor would not be budging and was 'quietly confident' of riding out the storm. But rebel unions want more cash for all OAPs regardless of income, arguing that means-testing is offensive and potentially disastrous electorally. However, Treasury sources said there would be no change to Friday's statement, which promised rising prosperity for all OAPs and 'transitional arrangements' until the introduction of a new pensioner tax credit in 2003. If the earnings link had not been broken in 1979, the basic pension would now be worth \u00a397.45, not \u00a365.50 for a single person. The majority of the 2,000 poll respondents said it should be over \u00a3100.",

He was right not to give in to the protesters, but Brown's reaction was harsh and provocative. I don't think that they handled it that well. I don't know if it's just the press, but it seems that hospital waiting lists are longer. My father, who lives in France, came to visit and was flabbergasted at the price of food and petrol. </p> <p> <b> Kamal Ladwa, 21 Freshbrook, Swindon, Student at Nottingham University</b> </p> <p> Labour have a tough job to do. I don't have a car, but the petrol crisis affected my lifts everywhere. It's a Catch 22 situation - I'm all right with fuel being taxed highly because of the environment. There's been no change in the NHS. I went for an operation recently. The NHS made me wait a month, so I had it done privately. It cost me \u00a31,000. There are no good options to vote for at the moment. The Dome was a joke, but I suppose the Conservatives would have done the same. </p> <p> <b> Pauline Venables, 75 Upper Stratton, Swindon, pensioner</b> </p> <p> I've voted Labour all my life. My husband and I share a state pension of \u00a3120 a week. My children pay my heating bills and so I manage to live comfortably. </p> <p>There's so much dissatisfaction at the moment; I've never heard so many Labour people complaining. </p> <p> There was not enough explanation by Labour for their position on the fuel strike, other than that they wouldn't give in to the protesters - who had a genuine grievance. </p> <p> <b> Jason Rickards, 30 Abbeymeads, Swindon, Business analyst</b> </p> <p> I was pleased when the fuel strikes happened. I get the bus every day and want to see more people using public transport,which, in this area, has improved. I voted for Labour in 1997 because I thought we needed a change. I liked their fresh approach, and I liked Blair: he's strong-willed and he knows what he wants. It's not really old Labour, but our generation likes it. If you look at the overall picture, we have 1.9 per cent inflation, interest rates lower than Germany and around one million people unem ployed. What's a few pence on petrol? I'd like to see Labour focus more on their successes. I can't understand their relationship with the press. People don't believe them; the spinning is out of control. They have to do something about that. </p> <p> <b> James Kent, 30 Stratton, Swindon, Taxi driver</b> </p> <p> I regret voting Labour in 1997. I seem to be worse off in virtually every respect. Fuel prices are rising, and my mortgage goes up every month. Blair didn't react to the fuel crisis that well. He told absurd lies - trying to get everyone to believe the NHS was on its knees. The protests were a long time coming, and we haven't seen the last of them. I'd be part of them myself if I had enough fuel to get there. With business as it is, I can't hold on for much longer. I can't see the country going any further with this government. They've lied, cheated and are fraudulent and corrupt. As for voting Labour, I won't be doing that again. </p>",

He was right not to give in to the protesters, but Brown's reaction was harsh and provocative. I don't think that they handled it that well. I don't know if it's just the press, but it seems that hospital waiting lists are longer. My father, who lives in France, came to visit and was flabbergasted at the price of food and petrol. Kamal Ladwa, 21 Freshbrook, Swindon, Student at Nottingham University Labour have a tough job to do. I don't have a car, but the petrol crisis affected my lifts everywhere. It's a Catch 22 situation - I'm all right with fuel being taxed highly because of the environment. There's been no change in the NHS. I went for an operation recently. The NHS made me wait a month, so I had it done privately. It cost me \u00a31,000. There are no good options to vote for at the moment. The Dome was a joke, but I suppose the Conservatives would have done the same. Pauline Venables, 75 Upper Stratton, Swindon, pensioner I've voted Labour all my life. My husband and I share a state pension of \u00a3120 a week. My children pay my heating bills and so I manage to live comfortably. There's so much dissatisfaction at the moment; I've never heard so many Labour people complaining. There was not enough explanation by Labour for their position on the fuel strike, other than that they wouldn't give in to the protesters - who had a genuine grievance. Jason Rickards, 30 Abbeymeads, Swindon, Business analyst I was pleased when the fuel strikes happened. I get the bus every day and want to see more people using public transport,which, in this area, has improved. I voted for Labour in 1997 because I thought we needed a change. I liked their fresh approach, and I liked Blair: he's strong-willed and he knows what he wants. It's not really old Labour, but our generation likes it. If you look at the overall picture, we have 1.9 per cent inflation, interest rates lower than Germany and around one million people unem ployed. What's a few pence on petrol? I'd like to see Labour focus more on their successes. I can't understand their relationship with the press. People don't believe them; the spinning is out of control. They have to do something about that. James Kent, 30 Stratton, Swindon, Taxi driver I regret voting Labour in 1997. I seem to be worse off in virtually every respect. Fuel prices are rising, and my mortgage goes up every month. Blair didn't react to the fuel crisis that well. He told absurd lies - trying to get everyone to believe the NHS was on its knees. The protests were a long time coming, and we haven't seen the last of them. I'd be part of them myself if I had enough fuel to get there. With business as it is, I can't hold on for much longer. I can't see the country going any further with this government. They've lied, cheated and are fraudulent and corrupt. As for voting Labour, I won't be doing that again.",

'Yes, we have some problems. Everyone can see that we have issues which people are expressing strong concerns about; for example, pensions and fuel.

What is clear is that you can't go on simply blaming the press.</p> <p>'It's for the Government to prepare its programme to convince an electorate that it's acting in its interests. If it's able to deliver in a confident way and has a good record of delivery - which this Government has without a doubt - keep your nerve, be proud of what we've done, but get out and tell them.</p> <p>'I am not a great one for polls, but I have noticed them. We've had unpopular polls - about transport two years ago and we dealt with the problem and we got the economy right and we put a huge amount of investment in and everybody said that's good. We did the same for hospitals and everybody said that's good and the polls tended to show it. We had unpopular polls in the spring and after the comprehensive spending review and the health expenditure and the transport expenditure; in the summer we improved and we showed that we were delivering.' He believes fortunes can change again.</p> <p>Matthew Taylor, the head of the well connected left-wing think-tank, the Institute of Public Policy Research, says that a little contrition wouldn't go amiss. 'Sometimes you have to eat humble pie,' said Taylor, who was assistant general secretary of the Labour Party before the last general election and was a senior member of the campaigns team. 'There needs to be a line drawn under the recent problems, some excitement needs to be created about new government initiatives. The debate needs to go forward.'</p> <p>Prescott, like so many politicians, cannot stomach the word 'sorry'. Keep apologising for everything and in the end nobody will trust you, he argues. 'Have you ever heard an editor [of a newspaper] apologise for getting something wrong? Blimey, if you adopted that principle when you got things wrong every paper would have the editor up every day apologising for what he had wrong.' He doesn't want the Government going down the same track.</p> <p>'Labour will lose the next election if it can't maintain the trust of the people,' he says. 'That will always be so. We must never be complacent, that is something the Prime Minister always says. Never take the electorate for granted.'</p> <p>Pollsters agree. Professor John Curtice, polling expert at Strathclyde University, says that the reason that the polls swung so swiftly against Blair (from a 20 per cent lead two months ago to a 4 per cent Tory lead last week) is because the Government committed the cardinal sin in the eyes of the people. The fuel crisis and Dome revealed a Government not in control of events.</p> <p>The last time there has been such a violent swing in the polls was at the time of the Falklands War, when Margaret Thatcher increased Tory support by 10 per cent. She was tough, in control. Blair appears to have vacillated on fuel and has remained silent on the Dome.</p> <p>But before Conservative Central Office starts hanging out the bunting, a word of caution. A careful reading of the performance of past governments in the opinion polls would offer Blair some comfort - and give William Hague a salutary warning.</p> <p>The over-riding point is that governments almost invariably gain ground as election day approaches. In the autumn of 1986, as last week, the Opposition held a narrow lead over the Government. Then, as now, a bald Opposition leader lagged in the personal popularity stakes behind a Prime Minister whose habit was to lead from the front. Then, as now, there was much talk of the governing party losing its landslide majority and facing a hung Parliament. And what happened? The following spring, the governing party - the Tories under Thatcher - returned to power with a 100-seat majority.</p> <p>Nor was that an isolated event. In nine of the past ten full Parliaments, the final six-to-nine months have seen a swing from Opposition to Government. What seems to happen with a fair degree of regularity is that some people who tell pollsters they yearn for a change when no election is imminent decide in the end that the incumbents aren't so awful after all. It even happened in the run-up to the 1997 general election. The Tories' 31 per cent on polling day was terrible enough - but it was significantly higher than their ratings throughout 1995 and 1996.</p> <p>So if history repeats itself, Labour ought to win an election next spring reasonably comfortably. What, though, if the polls next March show the race too close to call - say, Labour no more than five points ahead? It is at that point that Blair must decide whether to call a May election or wait until the autumn of next year or the following spring. Looking at what happened over the final 12-18 months of past Parliaments, the story is even more dramatic, with often huge Opposition leads either being cut back sharply or being overturned altogether.</p> <p>The Tories must face the fact that, even after moving into the lead for the first time in eight years, they remain the second most unpopular Opposition at this point in the political cycle in the 60-year history of polling. Only Labour in the autumn of 1982 stood lower . Yet suppose history does not repeat itself. What if the Tories stay narrowly ahead right through to polling day? Blair could still remain Prime Minister, for Britain's election system is now tilted in Labour's favour. If both Labour and Tories win the same number of votes, Labour is likely to have around 80 more MPs. To be sure of having more seats than Labour, the Conservatives need a 7 per cent lead in the popular vote.</p> <p>There are three main reasons for this:</p> <p>* Labour-dominated parts of Britain tend to have smaller constituencies than Tory-dominated areas. If constituencies in Wales and Scotland were the same size as in England, they would elect 23 fewer MPs; Labour would lose 19 of them.</p> <p>* Turnouts in strong Labour areas tend to be lower than in traditional Tory areas. Low turnouts in safe Labour seats drag down the party's national vote share by two-to-three points, but do not cost it any seats.</p> <p>* In 1997 tactical voting cost the Tories up to 35 seats.</p> <p>David Miliband, the unassuming but fiercely intelligent young head of Blair's policy unit, said two weeks ago he believed the first term in power had actually been all about proving Labour was a 'serious party of government', establishing its economic competence, airbrushing out the bad memories.</p> <p>'This Labour Government is establishing a new collective memory about what it means to be a New Labour Government. Gone is the winter of discontent: in its place a national minimum wage.</p> <p>He also highlighted a key New Labour problem, knee-jerkism, revealed in all its ridiculous glory earlier this year by the Prime Minister's sudden announcement that louts would be marched to cash machines to withdraw \u00a3100 to pay on-the-spot fines. Blair wanted to be seen doing something about crime. Two days later the idea was abandoned as unworkable.</p> <p>Miliband said: 'On every maths A-level paper it says please read the question carefully before you start to answer,' he warned. 'In the Government often the temptation is to rush in to give the policy answers before you really know what the question is.'</p> <p>Miliband argues that the key lesson he draws from Al Gore's presidential campaign in America is that the Centre-Left can succeed if it fights on the issues. Gore was behind Bush in the polls, started arguing about health and education, and is now ahead.</p> <p>'The lesson is that substance beats froth,' Miliband said.

      "bodyText": "A Croation general suspected of war crimes is believed to be at the centre of the Real IRA's arms smuggling network in the Balkans. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has questioned General Ivan Andabak over his alleged involvement in supplying the Real IRA with weapons, including the rocket-propelled grenade fired at the landmark MI6 headquarters in London last week. Andabak was a senior military figure during the conflict in Croatia in the mid-1990s and is suspected of war crimes during that period. The war crimes prosecutor's office in The Hague confirmed that investigators have interviewed Andabak. A spokesman said the general is believed to have received explosives training from Irish republicans in the 1990s and to have helped since to procure weapons for the dissident Real IRA. A senior RUC officer told The Observer that the RPG rocket fired at the MI6 building last Wednesday evening originated in the former Yugoslavia. He said it was similar to an RPG found by Irish police in a secret Real IRA firing range in Co Meath earlier this year. Given the huge stockpiles of arms in the Balkans, a sophisticated weapon such as the RPG can cost as little as \u00a3100. The RUC is investigating the role of an Irish aid worker from Co Louth who has long-standing connections to Catholic charities in Croatia thought to be involved in the arms-smuggling network. The allegations that a Croatian general was behind the arms route to the Real IRA first surfaced in the Boston Globe on Friday. A spokesman for the war crimes tribunal, Paul Risley, said Andabak was arrested by police in connection with the murder of a Bosnian Croat official who was blown up by an under-car booby trap similar to those devised by the Provisional IRA in the 1970s and 1980s. Risley confirmed that the investigators questioned Andabak about his links with Irish republicans, including explosives training and the establishment of arms networks. In the summer Croatian police intercepted a huge haul of guns, detonators and plastic explosives destined for the Real IRA. However, both the Gardai and the RUC have since confirmed that the Real IRA managed to smuggle an undisclosed number of weapons and bomb-making equipment out of the Balkans to Ireland. The security services fear that the Russian-made RPG could be used to assassinate a senior political or military figure in London. The MI6 rocket attack was the third time the Real IRA has struck in London this year. While the blast caused only minimal damage and temporary traffic chaos in the capital, the political consequences of the attack are enormous. Striking at such a key symbol of the British establishment will be a useful recruiting tool for the republican terror group. The attack took place just 12 hours before polling in the South Antrim by-election and was bound to have further dented grassroots unionist support for the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process. The Real IRA was formed in late 1997 after a split within the Provisional IRA over Sinn Fein's participation in the peace talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement. The terror group had called a ceasefire after its members placed a bomb in Omagh two years ago, killing 29. However, since the Omagh atrocity it has recruited disaffected former Provisional IRA activists and young nationalists, abandoned the ceasefire and concentrated its resources for terror attacks in England. Last week's sortie on MI6's headquarters came in the middle of the inquest into the slaughter at Omagh in August 1998.",

      "body": "<p>Britons were yesterday among the thousands of protesters turned away from the Czech border by police determined to minimise the extent of Tuesday's anti-capitalism protest, organisers said. </p> <p>About 30,000 demonstrators from across Europe are heading towards Prague this week, determined to disrupt the 55th Annual Meeting of the World Bank Group and the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). </p> <p>But instead of taking part in today's mass celebration, a warm-up before the main day of action next week, many demonstrators have spent the weekend camping at border crossings in pouring rain. </p> <p>Some have managed to complete their journeys by complaining to their embassy or by appealing to legal observers waiting behind the border controls. But thousands of others - at least one in every 50 demonstrators - are spending days travelling from one border crossing to another, unsuccessfully trying to find a weak link in the police line, before being forced to return home. </p> <p>'Czech border police are not making illegal demands on those attempting to enter the country, but they are sticking to the letter of the law with absolute rigidity,' said Karlos, a legal observer working for the Initiative Against Economic Globalisation, an umbrella group known by its Czech initials, Inpeg, created to coordinate this week's demonstrations. </p> <p>More than 70 protesters have been denied access to the Czech Republic from the border crossing at Zinnwald alone, in what organisers claim is a total contradiction of state rhetoric. </p> <p>'Nine-hour waits at the borders are now routine because police are searching exhaustively for ways of banning everyone they possibly can,' said Karlos. 'Occasionally they cross over and violate a human right, but on the whole they stay a hair's breadth away from actual violation.' </p> <p>Many activists have been caught by obscure legislation. 'I'm shaking with anger, but I'm not leaving. l'll find some way of getting through, even if it takes all week,' said Anya, a 35-year-old activist who spent more than 24 hours driving from Brighton to Prague in her 35ft van, only to be blocked at Zinnwald after Czech police found a slight irregularity in her vehicle registration papers. </p> <p>'I've travelled all over the world with exactly the same papers I gave the police here,' she said. 'I even came to Prague last year. They let me in then and now suddenly the same papers aren't good enough.'

      "bodyText": "Britons were yesterday among the thousands of protesters turned away from the Czech border by police determined to minimise the extent of Tuesday's anti-capitalism protest, organisers said. About 30,000 demonstrators from across Europe are heading towards Prague this week, determined to disrupt the 55th Annual Meeting of the World Bank Group and the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But instead of taking part in today's mass celebration, a warm-up before the main day of action next week, many demonstrators have spent the weekend camping at border crossings in pouring rain. Some have managed to complete their journeys by complaining to their embassy or by appealing to legal observers waiting behind the border controls. But thousands of others - at least one in every 50 demonstrators - are spending days travelling from one border crossing to another, unsuccessfully trying to find a weak link in the police line, before being forced to return home. 'Czech border police are not making illegal demands on those attempting to enter the country, but they are sticking to the letter of the law with absolute rigidity,' said Karlos, a legal observer working for the Initiative Against Economic Globalisation, an umbrella group known by its Czech initials, Inpeg, created to coordinate this week's demonstrations. More than 70 protesters have been denied access to the Czech Republic from the border crossing at Zinnwald alone, in what organisers claim is a total contradiction of state rhetoric. 'Nine-hour waits at the borders are now routine because police are searching exhaustively for ways of banning everyone they possibly can,' said Karlos. 'Occasionally they cross over and violate a human right, but on the whole they stay a hair's breadth away from actual violation.' Many activists have been caught by obscure legislation. 'I'm shaking with anger, but I'm not leaving. l'll find some way of getting through, even if it takes all week,' said Anya, a 35-year-old activist who spent more than 24 hours driving from Brighton to Prague in her 35ft van, only to be blocked at Zinnwald after Czech police found a slight irregularity in her vehicle registration papers. 'I've travelled all over the world with exactly the same papers I gave the police here,' she said. 'I even came to Prague last year. They let me in then and now suddenly the same papers aren't good enough.' But Anya's case does not surprise Karlos, a legal observer on the other side of the crossing. 'Cases like this show how little truth there was in the words of the Czech government when it said we had a political right to protest against the IMF meeting. This entire demonstra tion has shown how determined the Czech government really is to deny the right to free speech and political protest,' he said, as he rang around trying to order the papers Anya needed. 'They see this meeting as a method of entry into the serious world of big-boy politics and are prepared to deny the right the public has to express a plurality of political views.' Border police are using information from the FBI and Scotland Yard on known activists to prevent people entering the country, including activists from Seattle and Ya Basta!, a pressure group from Italy . Despite the difficulties, thousands of activists have successfully got in: a camp for 20,000 people on the outskirts of the city is already busy and most hostels and cheap hotels are booked up for the entire week. But police hope that, by flexing their muscles now, they will curb protesters' plans to disrupt the conference later in the week. Their plan appears to have worked: yesterday's nine peaceful demonstrations are being heralded by the police as proof that their months of preparation have been a success, although today's mass celebration will test that claim. Nevertheless, tension in Prague has escalated over the past few days in anticipation of Tuesday's demonstration. About 11,000 police, most of them in riot units trained to deal with violent fights rather than peaceful demonstrations, have been mobilised. They have admitted that tear gas and water cannon will be used if necessary. Six armoured personnel carriers, six troop trucks, two fire engines, two Mi-17 helicopters and two W-3A Sokol helicopters are on standby, according to the Prague Post . 'We know there are many protesters coming here with the intention of sabotaging the conference,' said a spokesman for the Czech police. 'Of course, we're nervous - this is the first major demonstration we have had to cope with, but if people complain we're too strict, well, rather that than a repeat of the devastation caused by the Seattle riots last November.' Prague, a Communist citadel for four decades until 1989, has reverted to a Soviet-era bunker mentality, closing more than 1,000 public schools and running a three-month series of alarmist advertisements on television and in the press, warning of the devastation which could hit the city this week. Many of Prague's 1.2 million citizens have responded by deserting the city but, keen to avoid a repetition of last year's much-criticised May Day riots in Prague, police have agreed to work with 100 volunteer legal observers stationed around the city who will report any violation of human rights. A hotline has also been set up by Inpeg for protesters to report incidents of abuse. There are tentative signs that the week could pass off smoothly: a right-wing dem-onstration against globalisation that many feared would act as a catalyst for the latent violence lurking here passed off smoothly yesterday, and police attendance was attentive but hands-off. Even so, protesters are unlikely to find support among older Czechs, said Danielle, 24, a member of the first free generation in the region for 50 years. 'There is practically no one in our parents' generation who has sympathy for this demonstration,' she said. 'The government has emphasised again and again over the past few months how awful it will be here during the conference, but they have not explained the reason why we feel the need to protest.'",

Then came Susan Hawk, known to America as the bitch among the last four Survivors on TV who said she'd rather watch a rival die of thirst than help her. Then came the man who wants to be the next President of the United States.</p> <p>This was the line-up for the downmarket Live with Regis chat show last Thursday night, starring George W. Bush in the kind of appearance that, more than ever, marks this presidential election campaign. Al Gore, meanwhile, has got himself into a wrangle over dirty jokes and both candidates have, of course, vied to impress Oprah Winfrey and David Letterman.</p> <p>Exactly 40 years ago on Tuesday, television transformed politics (and vice-versa) when the young, confident John F. Kennedy squared off against a haunted Richard Nixon in the first of the great presidential debates that have since been deemed the zenith of any campaign.</p> <p>Al Gore and George Bush will hold their contest six days after that anniversary, but the debates are nowhere near as important, nowadays, as moments such as those with Regis Philbin or Oprah.</p> <p>These appearances on puffball talk shows are called 'sight gags' - apparently vacuous guest spots that are actually big politics in disguise, aimed largely at the crucial women's vote.</p> <p>By all accounts, Bush had been genuinely nervous in the make-up room, staring like a schoolboy at photographs of Oprah with musicians and movie stars. On his own entrance, Al Gore had given her a high-five; 'Dubya' Bush had to go one better. He planted a kiss on her cheek. 'Why thank you,' she said. 'My pleasure,' he beamed.</p> <p>'Tell me about a time when you needed forgiveness', gushed Oprah 'Right Now!' chirped Bush. 'For real,' she pressed, 'Tell me a story'. Bush offered a few generalities. 'I'm looking for specifics!' teased Oprah. 'I know you are!' Bush giggled, 'but I'm running for President.'</p> <p>However, the American public soon knew that the candidate's favourite sandwich is peanut butter and jelly on white and that the one thing in life he couldn't manage without is jogging.

      "bodyText": "First on the show was a man who could smash 31 wooden boards over his head in 30 seconds. Then came Susan Hawk, known to America as the bitch among the last four Survivors on TV who said she'd rather watch a rival die of thirst than help her. Then came the man who wants to be the next President of the United States. This was the line-up for the downmarket Live with Regis chat show last Thursday night, starring George W. Bush in the kind of appearance that, more than ever, marks this presidential election campaign. Al Gore, meanwhile, has got himself into a wrangle over dirty jokes and both candidates have, of course, vied to impress Oprah Winfrey and David Letterman. Exactly 40 years ago on Tuesday, television transformed politics (and vice-versa) when the young, confident John F. Kennedy squared off against a haunted Richard Nixon in the first of the great presidential debates that have since been deemed the zenith of any campaign. Al Gore and George Bush will hold their contest six days after that anniversary, but the debates are nowhere near as important, nowadays, as moments such as those with Regis Philbin or Oprah. These appearances on puffball talk shows are called 'sight gags' - apparently vacuous guest spots that are actually big politics in disguise, aimed largely at the crucial women's vote. By all accounts, Bush had been genuinely nervous in the make-up room, staring like a schoolboy at photographs of Oprah with musicians and movie stars. On his own entrance, Al Gore had given her a high-five; 'Dubya' Bush had to go one better. He planted a kiss on her cheek. 'Why thank you,' she said. 'My pleasure,' he beamed. 'Tell me about a time when you needed forgiveness', gushed Oprah 'Right Now!' chirped Bush. 'For real,' she pressed, 'Tell me a story'. Bush offered a few generalities. 'I'm looking for specifics!' teased Oprah. 'I know you are!' Bush giggled, 'but I'm running for President.' However, the American public soon knew that the candidate's favourite sandwich is peanut butter and jelly on white and that the one thing in life he couldn't manage without is jogging. This - not his speech on education earlier in the day - was hailed as the beginning of Bush's upturn in the polls. Gore had done the show the previous week, when Oprah had said she 'stayed away from politicians' because she never thought she could have an honest conversation with them. Al Gore disabused her (maybe) by confiding that Local Hero was his favourite movie and his favourite quote was by Bob Dylan: 'Those not busy being born are busy dying.' But chasing mass appeal can be risky. Gore got in trouble at New York's Radio City. It had to happen: 'Lick Bush and Dick' - a jokey slogan referring to Dubya and his running mate Dick Cheney. It first appeared on unauthorised T-shirts at the Democrat convention in Los Angeles and, more vividly, at a star-studded gala from the mouth of actor and artist John Leguizamo. 'I'm absolutely thrilled that Al Gore picked Joe Lieberman to be Vice-President', quipped Leguizamo, explaining that Gore is thereby 'operating under a very old, wise principle that New York women have known for years.

Even two weeks ago it didn't look like the opposition could win - now we can win if Milosevic goes. The first thing I will do, if I can, is make a new baby for a new Yugoslavia.'</p> <p>There is still strong support for Milosevic among the old who treasure their right to vote and will come out in their thousands in support of him. They are the Communist generation, trusting faithfully in the wisdom of state television. People like Zoran Pantic, 60, who lives in the town of Vrsac close to the Romania border. His blue budgie squawks continuously in the sitting room of a small ground-floor flat as he repeats the mantra of TV Serbia which has been controlled by Milosevic since 1989. 'The Americans want to make us their slave. Turn us into a colony. That's why they told Nato to bomb us. When will they stop oppressing us with sanctions. Milosevic is rebuilding our country but what can a man do in an empty kitchen.'</p> <p>Gordana Petrovic, a 35-year-old geologist, said: 'Our biggest fear is that even if we do win he will not allow our victory. I am afraid of the police but I will go out on to the streets and there will be hundreds of thousands of us all around the country. It is one last chance to get rid of him.'</p> <p>On Wednesday night the opposition managed to bring at least 150,000 people on to the streets of Belgrade in what was seen as a dry run for tomorrow night.</p> <p>'We think there is a strong possibility that he will put the police on the streets - but nobody is sure how he will react. We don't think it is possible for his police to control the hundreds of thousands of people that will come out all over the country,' said Ivan Kocis, a former airforce pilot who is working with the opposition to try and prevent election fraud.</p> <p>Milosevic has around 120,000 police at his disposal. 'The police force is the only employer in Serbia that is taking on new workers,' according to Jovan Dulovic, a Belgrade journalist who has specialised in police and military affairs for more than 20 years. 'All police leave has been cancelled for September. There is no sign of any mobilisation but they are ready to go with a couple of hours' notice. They will be brought in from outside Belgrade to control the people there. Local police are not used in their home town.'</p> <p>The police force also includes the Special Intervention Brigade, some 30,000 men, many of them former volunteers and paramilitaries in the Bosnia and Croatian wars. 'These are tough guys, athletes who do weights and the cream of the force as well as former paramilitaries.'</p> <p>On a grey, wet weekend in Belgrade, the coffee shops on Republica Square were half empty. A couple in Mirijevo were buying in beer and mineral water. 'I need only beer and fish - I have everything else in the house. Maybe we are paranoid but we want to be prepared.'</p> <p>In the election, a virtually unknown candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, a 56-year-old lawyer with 19 opposition parties behind him, could win by as little as 300,000 votes.</p> <p>Last time Serbia voted against Milosevic was in the winter of 1996. Then, he refused to accept the defeat of his party in the local election and the people marched against him for three months. At the height of the protests there were 300,000 people on the streets of Belgrade. They failed when a fractured opposition did a deal and went into government. This time no deals are possible.</p> <p>The opposition is also better prepared to fight election fraud. 'This time we are organising for our food and drinks to be brought in from outside, prepared by our members. In 1997 our people were in the toilets for two hours with diarrhoea and couldn't see the ballot boxes being stuffed with votes for him,' says Kocis.</p> <p>'We will also be on the lookout for people buying votes at the gates of the polling stations. Last time people were being given deutschmarks and ballot papers that had already been marked for him. They would go inside and vote and then come back out and hand over their empty ballot paper.'</p> <p>Among the people carrying the water and food to the election polls and to the opposition workers will be Yovanovic. 'I joined the Communist party at 16 and left it at 17. I swore I'd never join another party in my life, but now I have to fight for my freedom.'</p>",

His blue budgie squawks continuously in the sitting room of a small ground-floor flat as he repeats the mantra of TV Serbia which has been controlled by Milosevic since 1989. 'The Americans want to make us their slave. Turn us into a colony. That's why they told Nato to bomb us. When will they stop oppressing us with sanctions. Milosevic is rebuilding our country but what can a man do in an empty kitchen.' Gordana Petrovic, a 35-year-old geologist, said: 'Our biggest fear is that even if we do win he will not allow our victory. I am afraid of the police but I will go out on to the streets and there will be hundreds of thousands of us all around the country. It is one last chance to get rid of him.' On Wednesday night the opposition managed to bring at least 150,000 people on to the streets of Belgrade in what was seen as a dry run for tomorrow night. 'We think there is a strong possibility that he will put the police on the streets - but nobody is sure how he will react. We don't think it is possible for his police to control the hundreds of thousands of people that will come out all over the country,' said Ivan Kocis, a former airforce pilot who is working with the opposition to try and prevent election fraud. Milosevic has around 120,000 police at his disposal. 'The police force is the only employer in Serbia that is taking on new workers,' according to Jovan Dulovic, a Belgrade journalist who has specialised in police and military affairs for more than 20 years. 'All police leave has been cancelled for September. There is no sign of any mobilisation but they are ready to go with a couple of hours' notice. They will be brought in from outside Belgrade to control the people there. Local police are not used in their home town.' The police force also includes the Special Intervention Brigade, some 30,000 men, many of them former volunteers and paramilitaries in the Bosnia and Croatian wars. 'These are tough guys, athletes who do weights and the cream of the force as well as former paramilitaries.' On a grey, wet weekend in Belgrade, the coffee shops on Republica Square were half empty. A couple in Mirijevo were buying in beer and mineral water. 'I need only beer and fish - I have everything else in the house. Maybe we are paranoid but we want to be prepared.' In the election, a virtually unknown candidate, Vojislav Kostunica, a 56-year-old lawyer with 19 opposition parties behind him, could win by as little as 300,000 votes. Last time Serbia voted against Milosevic was in the winter of 1996. Then, he refused to accept the defeat of his party in the local election and the people marched against him for three months. At the height of the protests there were 300,000 people on the streets of Belgrade. They failed when a fractured opposition did a deal and went into government. This time no deals are possible. The opposition is also better prepared to fight election fraud. 'This time we are organising for our food and drinks to be brought in from outside, prepared by our members. In 1997 our people were in the toilets for two hours with diarrhoea and couldn't see the ballot boxes being stuffed with votes for him,' says Kocis. 'We will also be on the lookout for people buying votes at the gates of the polling stations. Last time people were being given deutschmarks and ballot papers that had already been marked for him. They would go inside and vote and then come back out and hand over their empty ballot paper.' Among the people carrying the water and food to the election polls and to the opposition workers will be Yovanovic. 'I joined the Communist party at 16 and left it at 17. I swore I'd never join another party in my life, but now I have to fight for my freedom.'",

To get his hands on it, he has been prepared to take on a completely new division, a new chairman and the shareholders' wrath. </p> <p>Dowty is undoubtedly a sensible addition to Smiths' aerospace business - indeed, Smiths was one of the disappointed bidders when TI bought it back in 1992. Dowty is a big supplier to Airbus; Smiths has failed to crack the European aircraft manufacturer. Smiths is strong in the US military market, supplying Boeing's helicopter range, for example; Dowty's presence here is limited. Dowty is a big supplier of components for civil jets, so beloved of businessmen in a hurry; Smiths has made little headway in this field. </p> <p>Add the two businesses together and, the theory goes, both Dowty and Smiths can break into new markets. In practice, elbowing other suppliers out is harder than it sounds - as Smiths knows. It has acquired Airbus suppliers in the past, but has still failed to make much headway. </p> <p>At least the businesses are in the same markets and produce roughly similar products. There, the commercial logic ends. The three other divisions are simply transported in unchanged from the merger partners - medical and industrial from Smiths and sealing solutions from TI. </p> <p>The lack of synergy elsewhere is reflected in the fact that the cost savings from the merger are put at just \u00a325 million in the first full year of trading, less than 5 per cent of the combined pre-tax profits. That would be less worrying if it could quantify the extra sales it expects from merging the aerospace businesses, but it refuses to be drawn. </p> <p>With a nod at Invensys, the company created through a merger of fellow engineers Siebe and BTR, Smiths says the silence reflects the fact that it prefers to deliver the profits rather than just talk about them. And it has been excellent at producing results - profits and dividends have grown by at least 10 per cent a year for the past six years. </p> <p>But that begs the question of why it should bother with this merger. Its record and the reputation of its management are such that it would have had little problem raising the money for virtually any deal it wanted to do. TI has been more or less publicly for sale for months, and is now auctioning its automotive business. Could Smiths not have persuaded it to sell off Dowty as part of a break-up of the business? </p> <p>Shareholders would even have understood if Smiths had decided to sell its medical division to concentrate on aerospace and the industrial division, which is building up a profitable niche in the telecoms equipment market. </p> <p>Instead, Butler-Wheelhouse has come up with a merger which has wiped out its premium rating at a stroke. The deal has turned it from a well-regarded engineer to an unfocused conglomerate. It will take more than a few contract wins at Airbus to win its reputation back. </p> <p><strong> Troubled waters</strong><br> </p> <p>RWE, the German utility, has chosen a good target in Thames. It is one of the leading international water companies, with interests in Turkey, China and the US as well as 12 million customers here. After a shaky start as a private company, it is well run and has a decent performance record. The addition of Thames will considerably increase the credibility of RWE's efforts to build a presence in the fast-growing international water market. </p> <p>The real pity is that Thames could not do it on its own. Its reputation is good enough. So is its management. But Thames has the twin obstacles of tough regulation and indifferent in-vestors to contend with.

The City's fears that regulatory pressure can only in-crease has depressed shares. </p> <p>That has limited their scope for expansion: in-vestors do not want any more shares, and lenders are equally concerned about the effect of regulation on their ability to service their debts.

      "body": "<p>Sometimes the smallest explosions have the greatest impacts. When Victor Chandler, a little known bookmaker serving big spending punters, moved his entire operation to the tax haven of Gibraltar in 1997 he detonated a small limpet mine which capsized the entire UK betting industry. </p> <p>The shockwaves are still being felt today. The big-name bookmakers, such as Ladbrokes, were forced to follow Chandler overseas, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, once confident of making around \u00a3500 million a year from betting duties, was left scratching his head. </p> <p>Chandler laughs when he recalls the way his larger rivals followed him abroad. 'They had to do it,' he says. 'Otherwise we'd have had all their business.' </p> <p>Not only did his actions give Gordon Brown something to think about, Chandler's adept use of new technology now has serious consequences for the high street. It would take a very optimistic punter to bet on a rosy future for the UK's 8,500 betting shops as a result of Chandler's run to the sun. Telephone and internet betting may have accounted for only around 10 per cent of all the money staked in the UK last year but it is set for huge growth. According to analysts at Datamonitor, online betting in Europe could be worth as much as as \u00a33.5 billion by 2004. </p> <p>Okay, there is a chance Customs and Excise will challenge the UK bookmakers' actions, but it is hard to see what they can do, now that the horses have effectively bolted. At present the Government can merely prevent the likes of Chandler adver tising in the UK. But click on to any of the big online bookmakers' UK-based sites and you will be offered the chance to jump through to its offshore cousin. </p> <p>Certainly the Bahamas-based billionaire Joe Lewis thinks Chandler's business represents the future of betting. He liked the company so much that in August last year he bought it. Enic, Lewis's international investment company, valued Victor Chandler International (VCI) at around \u00a365m.

      "bodyText": "Sometimes the smallest explosions have the greatest impacts. When Victor Chandler, a little known bookmaker serving big spending punters, moved his entire operation to the tax haven of Gibraltar in 1997 he detonated a small limpet mine which capsized the entire UK betting industry. The shockwaves are still being felt today. The big-name bookmakers, such as Ladbrokes, were forced to follow Chandler overseas, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, once confident of making around \u00a3500 million a year from betting duties, was left scratching his head. Chandler laughs when he recalls the way his larger rivals followed him abroad. 'They had to do it,' he says. 'Otherwise we'd have had all their business.' Not only did his actions give Gordon Brown something to think about, Chandler's adept use of new technology now has serious consequences for the high street. It would take a very optimistic punter to bet on a rosy future for the UK's 8,500 betting shops as a result of Chandler's run to the sun. Telephone and internet betting may have accounted for only around 10 per cent of all the money staked in the UK last year but it is set for huge growth. According to analysts at Datamonitor, online betting in Europe could be worth as much as as \u00a33.5 billion by 2004. Okay, there is a chance Customs and Excise will challenge the UK bookmakers' actions, but it is hard to see what they can do, now that the horses have effectively bolted. At present the Government can merely prevent the likes of Chandler adver tising in the UK. But click on to any of the big online bookmakers' UK-based sites and you will be offered the chance to jump through to its offshore cousin. Certainly the Bahamas-based billionaire Joe Lewis thinks Chandler's business represents the future of betting. He liked the company so much that in August last year he bought it. Enic, Lewis's international investment company, valued Victor Chandler International (VCI) at around \u00a365m. Chandler and his partner, Monaco-based millionaire racehorse owner Michael Tabor, will each retain stakes of around 20 per cent in the company. The deal seemed to have been sidelined over the past few months, but Chandler is adamant that it will now go through by November. The Enic deal, Chandler argues, will give VCI the chance to become a truly global online player. 'There's no doubt that we've got to have the cash to market ourselves. In four or five years' time there will be only four or five players in the world betting market.' Chandler had one eye on what the big US gaming giants might be looking to do in Europe. 'We needed to do a deal because we've got to establish our position quickly now.' Apart from Lewis, Chandler also rubs shoulders with another famous businessman. Terry Ramsden, who was once Britain's fifty-seventh richest man but ended up becoming one of the country's most famous bankrupts after running up gambling losses of more than \u00a3100m, also does business with Chandler.

Flametree has struck a deal with <a href=\"http://www.revolver.com/\">revolver.com</a>, an online recruitment firm which is to start taking some content on its site. </p> <p>Although some dotcom firms have found the going tough in recent months - notably clickmango, the online vitamin company that shut up shop last month - Flametree is confident it has a strong future. </p> <p>'It's quite unique.

      "body": "<p>A truly curious letter appeared in the New York Times two years ago headed, 'It's time to repay America', by one Tony Blair. In it, he thanked Bill Clinton and the whole of the US for introducing him to the pleasures of governing the American Way. That, he wrote, meant 'results, not theology... free from preconceptions and bureaucratic wrangling... Government should not hinder the logic of the market!' </p> <p>As an American, I should have been flattered, but this outburst of affection was a wee bit embarrassing, like getting a Valentine dipped in perfume from an office mate. </p> <p>And I suspected that, as the poets say, beneath the greatest love is a hurricane of hate. So what so bugs Tony that he would write this billet-doux to 270 million foreigners? The PM's acrid reaction to the petrol revolt gives a glimpse of his dark secret: in his heart, Tony Blair hates Britain. </p> <p>This Prime Minister despises his storybook countryside and its grumbling farmers with their two little pigs and their tiny fields edged with dry stone. He cringes at the little bell ringing over the door of the village post office - so quaint and so maddeningly inefficient. He cannot fathom a nation that weeps over How Green was my Valley and moans when he shuts those filthy coal pits. </p> <p>He is frustrated to tears by fossilised trade unions which chain workers to dead industries, rather than building new ones, and by the rabid blue-hairs who demand he keep the Queen's nose on the coinage. Blair dreams of birthing the Entrepreneurial State. Instead, he finds himself caretaker of a museum of nineteenth-century glories made somnolent by easy welfare and low ambitions. </p> <p>Blair gazes across the water with almost erotic envy at Bill Clinton, chairman of the board of America Inc. This week, the once-arrogant now-jittery New Labour faithful creep towards their Brighton party conference to seek reassurance from above. It is important to understand how Blair's pathological imitation of Clinton is, in fact, pathetically off the mark. In misunderstanding the source of Clinton's - and now Gore's - political magic, Blair jeopardises his party's majority, and his nation's industry. </p> <p>Blair looks for the secrets to Clinton's economic and political success in all the wrong places. This struck me forcefully last week when I found myself in possession of a World Bank document so confidential even the bank's board has yet to see it: the latest Country Policy and Institutional Assessment, its internal 'school report' for less developed countries. The Bank rates each nation from one to six for their adherence to the neo-liberal ideals of the Bank, the International Monetary Fund and allied agencies. </p> <p>Bolivia, which deployed tanks and tear gas to quell a public revolt over water price hikes, gets an admirable two and a pat on the head. But Haiti, which is resisting demands to sell off its national infrastructure, gets a dunce's six, and is sent to bed without supper or access to capital markets. </p> <p>Highest marks go to nations committed to the five horsemen of the Washington Consensus: privatisation of public services, budget austerity, trade liberalisation, deregulation of industry, and labour market 'flexibility'. </p> <p>One gets the impression that Blair wants to be teachers' pet, to score straight ones in these tests, and bring back from Washington the Promethean fire that will transform Britain's socio-economic soul and drag it, kicking and screaming, into the third millennium. </p> <p>US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told a London audience last December: 'With a flexible labour force, you too can replicate America's prosperity!' The Prime Minister bit his lip with jealousy. By 'flexibility', Summers means what the World Bank calls 'non-wage employment costs' - from working week limitations to pension guarantees - which hinder businesses' ability to use employees as they would any other commodity. </p> <p>Blair doesn't understand that Summers' 'flexible labour force' prescription is a con. In 1993, I ran into David Lipton, then Summers' deputy, at a party celebrating Clinton's signing of a new maternity leave law. Lipton had just returned from Eastern Europe, where he had told Poland's President to end maternity leave benefits. </p> <p>Did he note any hypocrisy? He was puzzled. Flexible (read 'unprotected') employment is for them - for the Polands and Bolivias - to serve our interests. It could not possibly apply to the US. If Blair were savvy, he'd note that while Clinton's minions sell modernisation snake oil through World Bank assessments and Third Way seminars, the President sells American voters protection from the risks of the new economy. </p> <p>Clinton - and his heir apparent, Al Gore - are proud to stand as bulwarks against the privatisation of the US social security system. They campaign on commitments to spend trillions on investment in public services, rather than cutting taxes, and they crow over new controls on employment and new restrictions on 'big tobacco, big drug companies and big polluters', to use Gore's phrase. </p> <p>By contrast Blair, in his snarling response to the petrol tax protesters, showed his commitment to 'the logic of the marketplace'. How unClintonesque. </p> <p>Blair should have noted how, during the November uprising in Seattle, even when ruckus-makers vandalised the President's favourite eatery, McDonald's, Clinton resisted the urge to go into Blairish scold mode. He praised the honourable intentions of the protesters, felt their pain and, to the horror of the UK contingent, effectively ended the World Trade Organisation meeting. </p> <p>Clinton is not above abusing Blair's naive desire to boost US corporate interests. For example, internal US Department of Commerce memos state that in 1997, Clinton's commerce secretary, William Daley, leaned on Margaret Beckett, Blair's first Trade and Industry Secretary, to grant US energy companies waivers to Labour's moratorium on building new gas-fired power plants. Daley's notes say Blair overruled Beckett and 'watered down the moratorium' to help US investors. </p> <p>This effectively sealed the fate of Britain's coal mines (and, I note, left the nation with no alternative energy source to counterbalance the current oil price rise). Given such consequences, why did he hop like a bunny to Clinton's bidding? </p> <p>For the answer, we must step back for a wider view. The US power companies that cashed in on Blair's policy exemption were merely the first of a battalion of adventuring American operators that wiped their feet on the golden doormat at Number 10. </p> <p>Wal-Mart swallowed Asda after its executives held an extraordinary closed meeting with the PM himself. Special privileges were extended to Wackenhut, the private prisons corporation, to Columbia private hospitals, to Monsanto, and to GTech, the bribe-tainted lottery operator. And today, the Government is hoping to lure in Edison, the schools privatisation company. </p> <p>Yet in the US, these companies are not fondly treated. Blair seems unaware that Edison is withering under Gore's attacks on privatisation. The Clinton administration has ground down Columbia with investigations and new regulations. Wackenhut has yet to recover from criminal investigations. No matter: to Blair they are a thrusting American stud pool which will breed with the mangy local stock. If the Wal-Mart dragon torches the high street, that too serves the higher purpose of economic Darwinism. </p> <p>Clinton is a class warrior. His commerce department's calls to Beckett indicate that, when push comes to shove, he will do the bidding of corporate America. Gore blasts the drug companies in paid political adverts, then plays their poodle to yap at African nations that dare to demand cheap Aids drugs. </p> <p>Gore, but not Blair, has learnt from Clinton how to play it both ways: working class hero and Wall Street's friend. Clinton's not bothered by cumbersome convictions or hifalutin theories. </p> <p>But Blair is a believer. He has none of Clinton's cynical cool. The PM has been wrongly tagged a philosophically empty bionic election machine, a box of poll-driven gears with a smile painted on the front. In fact, Blair may be the most idealistic, principled leader in the non-Moslem world, committed fanatically to the transformation of his nation's socio-economic soul. And that's frightening. </p> <p>But Britain is not Bolivia - yet. Blair cannot understand that the Washington jabber about flexible workforces and globalisation is a gloss for the projection of American commercial powers and privileges. Its aim is to make weaker nations' assets and labour accessible, cheap and compliant to US investors. </p> <p>Yet Blair sincerely believes that if he turns over Britain's high streets to Wal-Mart, its fields to Monsanto and its schools to Edison, they will sprinkle American commercial know-how over his laggardly island and - presto! - enterprise will take off. </p> <p>How profitable for American and local capital. And how sad to see the PM's affections abused. Only in electoral defeat will he realise that, as they say in Arkansas, he's been kissed, but he ain't been loved. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Gregory.palast@theguardian.com\">Gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>It would have been naive to hope that the 'tragic inevitability' of Paula Yates's death would not be matched by tragically inevitable media coverage.</p> <p>As it happened, in death as in life, Yates was dealt the usual exploitative judgmental guff, only this time with a new twist in the shape of Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily, the four-year-old daughter she had with the late Michael Hutchence.</p> <p>After the media had exhausted their cod hand-wringing over Yates's sleazy lifestyle and manner of death (confusing the two to the point where you could be forgiven for believing that it was plastic surgery and rock-star sex which killed her), Tiger Lily's 'orphan doom' was the main mawkish draw.</p> <p>There have been poignant shots of Tiger Lily all week, either taking up the entire front page of newspapers, or featured as part of lavish, melancholy spreads. Some pictures featured Yates and Hutchence as well, but mainly they depicted Tiger Lily, standing in parks, seemingly 'all alone in the world' - whoever happened to be minding her at the time having presumably been cut out of the shot, and banished to that great editorial dustbin in the sky.</p> <p>With this use of Tiger lily's image, what would otherwise have been routine salacious coverage of a celebrity death suddenly became an opportunity for the media to take the high moral ground. Not only were the papers fixated with the idea of Yates choking on her own vomit, they were concerned about poor little Tiger Lily!</p> <p>In turn, the public was prevailed upon to be equally concerned about this Little Orphan Annie of the rock-star set. When, in fact, in the nicest possible way, there was no cause for concern at all.</p> <p>As hard as it sounds, it's different for celebrity orphans, or indeed any orphan who happens to be surrounded by doting, well-connected relatives. It's not that I don't have sympathy for the cruel hand Tiger Lily has been dealt.

      "bodyText": "It would have been naive to hope that the 'tragic inevitability' of Paula Yates's death would not be matched by tragically inevitable media coverage. As it happened, in death as in life, Yates was dealt the usual exploitative judgmental guff, only this time with a new twist in the shape of Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily, the four-year-old daughter she had with the late Michael Hutchence. After the media had exhausted their cod hand-wringing over Yates's sleazy lifestyle and manner of death (confusing the two to the point where you could be forgiven for believing that it was plastic surgery and rock-star sex which killed her), Tiger Lily's 'orphan doom' was the main mawkish draw. There have been poignant shots of Tiger Lily all week, either taking up the entire front page of newspapers, or featured as part of lavish, melancholy spreads. Some pictures featured Yates and Hutchence as well, but mainly they depicted Tiger Lily, standing in parks, seemingly 'all alone in the world' - whoever happened to be minding her at the time having presumably been cut out of the shot, and banished to that great editorial dustbin in the sky. With this use of Tiger lily's image, what would otherwise have been routine salacious coverage of a celebrity death suddenly became an opportunity for the media to take the high moral ground. Not only were the papers fixated with the idea of Yates choking on her own vomit, they were concerned about poor little Tiger Lily! In turn, the public was prevailed upon to be equally concerned about this Little Orphan Annie of the rock-star set. When, in fact, in the nicest possible way, there was no cause for concern at all. As hard as it sounds, it's different for celebrity orphans, or indeed any orphan who happens to be surrounded by doting, well-connected relatives. It's not that I don't have sympathy for the cruel hand Tiger Lily has been dealt. The poor mite hasn't even made it to infant class and both her parents have died, most probably accidentally, but definitely in sordid, avoidable circumstances. Whichever way you cut it, it is a sad, stupid waste and only the blackest of hearts could fail to wish that things had been different. It is, however, a complete nonsense to suggest that Tiger Lily is in any way 'alone in the world'. While technically an orphan, Tiger Lily appears to be surrounded by people who have more than enough emotional nous and financial clout to care for her properly, both at this dreadful time, and for the rest of her life. It's extremely interesting how this crucial nugget of information managed to end up being simultaneously 'splashed' and blithely ignored, by the media in the aftermath of Yates's death. All week, the headlines have been screaming that both Hutchence's parents and Yates's ex-husband Bob Geldof, who already has custody of Tiger Lily's three half-sisters, are more than willing to give the child a loving home. Although the circumstances are tragic, these developments should surely be a cause for relief, even quiet celebration, for the concerned British public. After all, wherever she ends up, Tiger Lily will at least be properly cared for - counselled and cossetted to whatever degree it takes. To suggest that Tiger Lily might actually be better off without her birth parents is ludicrous, but no one could deny that she is destined to be much better off than the vast majority of other orphans in this country. Children are orphaned in Britain all the time in a bewildering variety of ways - accident, disease, sheer bad luck, you name it, there's probably a British child who has been orphaned as a result of it. If it's parallels with Yates's death you're looking for, then there are plenty of examples of alcoholic or druggy corpses who miscalculated the effect of the night's consumption, lay down in their own vomit and died.

Rosemary Brian Croyde, Devon \u0095 After all that has been written about the 'petrol crisis', have other readers begun to have an uneasy feeling that there has been a slightly sinister political undertone to the whole affair? We are told that it was a 'totally spontaneous' event by ordinary people - that being the case, how was it that those described as 'leaders' outside the various depots all seemed to know each other and be able to communicate instantly by mobile phone? And why did the name 'Countryside Alliance' keep cropping up; I thought that organisation was only interested in keeping foxhunting alive and our rural species of songbirds dead? Leslie Fraser-Mitchell Swaffham, Norfolk \u0095 The crisis highlights the folly and injustice of relying too much on indirect taxation as a source of revenue, because this takes a larger proportion of poor people's income than rich people's. Progressive income tax, where those who are wealthy contribute at a higher rate to society's needs than those who are not well off, is the most equitable method. I think Tony Blair's greatest mistake was made before the election when he promised not to raise income tax, even on the highest earners.

The islands have gone on the open market amid grave concern from local conservationists that by selling them to the highest bidder, their unique, unspoilt character may be jeopardised. To the fury of locals, the estate agent handling the sale, the Edinburgh office of FPD Savills, is marketing the islands as a haven for city dwellers looking for a place to act out their own version of the BBC television series Castaway 2000 .

Now taking his seat at a match can no longer be taken for granted. 'I knew when I went to Bath Rugby Club last week, where a ladder is the only route to the press area, that it would be a test,' he said. 'I wasn't sure whether I could do it.

He had always seemed indestructible. I need not have worried. Hignell was open, matter-of-fact, still as positive in outlook as he always was - and relaxing.</p> <p>As a schoolboy I encountered him on a rugby pitch. We were opposing scrum halves - he moved to full back at Cambridge University - and I waved him to the try line several times.</p> <p>'You might be able to stop me now,' he smiled. And I had a vague recollection of running him out when batting for England Schoolboys against touring West Indian cricketers in 1974.</p> <p>He always was an unselfish sportsman.

'The finger and thumb on my right hand went numb, but they could not find out why. Then there were bladder problems and I remember holding a microphone to interview someone at Gloucester and my hand kept wobbling. There was also pain in my right leg but I thought we could blame the orthodopaedic surgeons for that [he had recently undergone a hip replacement]. But in January 1999 they diagnosed multiple sclerosis.'</p> <p>Soon he began to address the practical implications. The BBC was informed and remain supportive. He and his wife, Jeannie, are planning to move to an apartment where there are no stairs.</p> <p>Typing can be a problem, so he's invested in a computer that transforms the spoken word into text, though at the first attempt 'Alastair Hig-nell' came out as 'Where's that by smell'. He knows that his days driving from ground to ground may be limited. And to prevent the disease dominating everything, a rule has been established in his household: half an hour is set aside for discussing MS and the changes it brings to the lives of the family; at other times, the subject is off limits.</p> <p>He has had tremendous support from the rugby fraternity. When Ian Robertson, the BBC rugby correspondent, learnt of his plight, he suggested a dinner to raise funds. This is on 21 November. England coaches Clive Woodward and Andy Robinson have promised the support of the team. Nigel Wray, owner of Saracens Rugby Club, wrote a cheque to help with the immediate future.</p> <p>New MS sufferers inherit a great financial burden, which goes way beyond the need to modify their domestic arrangements. At the moment the only drug that checks the decline of sufferers is beta interferon, which costs \u00a311,200 a year. Until recently this was freely available, but the Government decided it could no longer be provided free to new sufferers because it does not represent value for money.</p> <p>Hignell, 45, is determined to keep working until he's 60. I wouldn't put that past him, but, like all others afflicted with MS, he could do with some government support.</p> <p>Vic Marks is The Observer's cricket correspondent.</p>",

And to prevent the disease dominating everything, a rule has been established in his household: half an hour is set aside for discussing MS and the changes it brings to the lives of the family; at other times, the subject is off limits. He has had tremendous support from the rugby fraternity. When Ian Robertson, the BBC rugby correspondent, learnt of his plight, he suggested a dinner to raise funds. This is on 21 November. England coaches Clive Woodward and Andy Robinson have promised the support of the team. Nigel Wray, owner of Saracens Rugby Club, wrote a cheque to help with the immediate future. New MS sufferers inherit a great financial burden, which goes way beyond the need to modify their domestic arrangements. At the moment the only drug that checks the decline of sufferers is beta interferon, which costs \u00a311,200 a year. Until recently this was freely available, but the Government decided it could no longer be provided free to new sufferers because it does not represent value for money. Hignell, 45, is determined to keep working until he's 60. I wouldn't put that past him, but, like all others afflicted with MS, he could do with some government support.

Some of Michael Radford's are bona-fide Saracen marrows, others overgrown courgettes, but the difference in eating quality is minimal. Average weight in the shop is around 4 to 5lbs, but there may be the odd 10lb giant, more suitable perhaps for gardeners wishing to pass off a prime specimen as their own at the village f\u00eate.

      "body": "<p>Men cost this country a fortune. Take the money wasted locking us up, for example - men make up 95 per cent of the prison population. Take the poor return on outlay for our education. Not only do girls increasingly outperform us in exams, but four out of five excluded pupils are boys. Take the havoc we wreak on the roads. We cause 94 per cent of road accidents, including nine out of 10 road deaths. There is more, but before we start arguing for a tax on men, there's one area in which we're saving the nation a packet - pensions. The life of the average man is shorter than that of the average woman by five years. And between the richest women and the poorest men the gap is wider still - more than 10 years.</p> <p>The reasons have little to do with biology. Before the industrial revolution, the risks involved in childbirth meant that women generally died younger than men. Since then, though, the picture has changed, and statistics show that today men are more likely than women to die from cancer, heart disease, HIV infection, accidents and suicide. It's perhaps surprising, then, that 'men's health' as an area of investigation has only very recently come into its own.</p> <p>'Ten years ago, nobody was interested,' says Dr Ian Banks, chair of the Men's Health Forum (MHF). 'Politicians wouldn't talk about men's health for fear of being labelled anti-women, and we had similar problems within the British Medical Association.'</p> <p>Banks also says that health campaigns have overtargeted women - a problem that the government's minister for public health, Yvette Cooper, has asked the new Health Development Agency, responsible for health promotion, to address. In March of this year, the organisation's first conference on the needs of young men took place and the HDA's national advisor on young people, Sally Taylorson, says that 'for the first time, we're specifically building men's needs into what we're doing'.</p> <p>The true extent of gender health inequalities was not fully appreciated, even within the medical profession, until a wake-up call in 1992, when the then chief medical officer, Kenneth Calman, drew attention to male mortality data in his annual report. Since then, attitudes at policy level have steadily started to change. Earlier this year, Cooper commented on 'the biggest health inequality - that between men and women', and when the MHF launches its own website on 10 October, Cooper will be cutting the virtual tape. Banks feels that the increased level of political interest owes much to individuals like Cooper and her predecessor Tessa Jowell, but also to the women's movement. 'The success of action by women to address inequalities in their lives has made it easier for us to talk about the inequalities in ours.'</p> <p>It is not that men aren't interested in health issues - you only have to listen to them discussing Darren Anderton's latest injury to realise this - more that traditional health-promotion methods and messages are not reaching them. Men take more chances with their health and, when things do go wrong, they're less inclined to do anything about it. Men are more likely to drink too much, to smoke, to be overweight, to use illegal drugs and to take risks when sunbathing, driving or doing pretty much anything. Despite this, they are much less likely to consult a doctor. On average, men go to an NHS GP four times a year compared with women's six visits.</p> <p>'When men do use the NHS, they don't do it properly,' says Trefor Lloyd, who, through the organisation Working With Men, has been helping young men confront issues around masculinity and men's health for 17 years. 'Rather than go to their GP, they're more likely to turn up at casualty or to wait until things get serious. This is obviously inappropriate for them and expensive for the NHS. So there are good economic as well as equal-opportunity arguments for getting men to deal with health issues effectively.'</p> <p>Taking risks and ignoring the results are two sides of the same macho coin. The problem, Lloyd says, lies in the way men are brought up. 'Men are supposed to tough it out. A superhero like Rambo doesn't go to the doctor's, he stitches himself up. Men feel they are expected to cope on their own.'</p> <p>Lessons in being strong and silent have been absorbed by all males - both patients and doctors. 'A consultation between a woman GP and a woman patient will last four times as long as one between a male doctor and a male patient,' says Lloyd. 'Because men don't use the system, primary healthcare doesn't have the experience to cope with them when they do. It can easily misread what men are saying to them.'</p> <p>Lloyd welcomes any initiatives taken to target men about their health, but is wary of approaches that just trawl for men wherever they can be found without evaluating effectiveness. 'Sport and the internet are sometimes seen to be the answer to everything, because there are a lot of men involved in both,' he says. 'But the number of hits on a website, or number of leaflets given out at a football match are no indication of a campaign's success, any more than the number of articles in the press is. If I'm at a match, I'm more interested in the game than prostate cancer, and just because you log on to a site doesn't mean you do anything about it.'</p> <p>Used inappropriately, the internet could do more harm than good. 'Talking in a chatroom may help in the short term,' says Lloyd, 'but in the long term it is compounding the real problem, which is about problems with communicating with real people, the very reason men don't go to their GP in the first place.'</p> <p>Launching alongside the Men's Health Forum website, which is targeted mainly at the increasing number of health and other professionals taking an interest in the subject, will be malehealth.co.uk, a site aimed at men themselves. Editor Peter Baker describes it as 'the first comprehensive in-depth health website for men in the UK and possibly the world'. He feels there's a need to think about men's health in the broadest sense possible. He feels, for example, that the obsession in some men's health writing with the gymnasium and the 'six-pack stomach' does nothing to address the state of mind that makes men reluctant to seek healthcare. 'There's nothing wrong with physical fitness,' he says, 'but the idea that you need a certain body shape to be healthy is daft. It's not good for men's mental health. It increases self-consciousness about body image and sets a standard that is unattainable for most men.'</p> <p>Unattainable and irrelevant. Low income, poor diet, poor air quality, poor housing, inadequate access to services and education - all have a massive impact on health which jogging and press-ups will do little to offset. Of course, these social and environmental factors affect some people more than others and the global mortality figures mask stark class differences. While the mortality gap between men and women is finally narrowing among higher-income groups, it is still widening among those on lower incomes. Life expectancy for a man in social classes 4 and 5 is under 70; for a woman in social classes 1 and 2, it is over 80.</p> <p>Banks wants a more holistic approach. 'Because the Tories saw health as an individual responsibility, public health went down the tubes,' he says. 'It's made such a difference that we can start talking about inequality and social problems again. Even apparently individual problems like smoking have a social dimension - just look at the social groups who tend to smoke. We're also realising that improving men's health will improve women's health, too. After all, women are suffering looking after their sick men.'</p> <p>This government is taking gender inequalities in health seriously and it is putting the causes firmly on the agenda. It has accepted that traditional health- promotion techniques have not reached men and it is looking to organisations such as the Men's Health Forum to help it find new ways. All this makes good political sense. As Ian Banks says: 'Politicians can see the opportunity to make a big impact on the figures with relatively little input.'</p> <p>The challenge will come when the easy things have been done and the gap is still there. Yes, we need to talk to men and yes, we need to persuade them to go to their GP. But once they're there, we need to make them better. Last month's \u00a34.2m injection into prostate-cancer research was a small step in the right direction. There will need to be more.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.Menshealthforum.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Menshealthforum.org.uk</a>. launches on 10 October.

Banks also says that health campaigns have overtargeted women - a problem that the government's minister for public health, Yvette Cooper, has asked the new Health Development Agency, responsible for health promotion, to address. In March of this year, the organisation's first conference on the needs of young men took place and the HDA's national advisor on young people, Sally Taylorson, says that 'for the first time, we're specifically building men's needs into what we're doing'. The true extent of gender health inequalities was not fully appreciated, even within the medical profession, until a wake-up call in 1992, when the then chief medical officer, Kenneth Calman, drew attention to male mortality data in his annual report. Since then, attitudes at policy level have steadily started to change. Earlier this year, Cooper commented on 'the biggest health inequality - that between men and women', and when the MHF launches its own website on 10 October, Cooper will be cutting the virtual tape. Banks feels that the increased level of political interest owes much to individuals like Cooper and her predecessor Tessa Jowell, but also to the women's movement. 'The success of action by women to address inequalities in their lives has made it easier for us to talk about the inequalities in ours.' It is not that men aren't interested in health issues - you only have to listen to them discussing Darren Anderton's latest injury to realise this - more that traditional health-promotion methods and messages are not reaching them. Men take more chances with their health and, when things do go wrong, they're less inclined to do anything about it. Men are more likely to drink too much, to smoke, to be overweight, to use illegal drugs and to take risks when sunbathing, driving or doing pretty much anything. Despite this, they are much less likely to consult a doctor. On average, men go to an NHS GP four times a year compared with women's six visits. 'When men do use the NHS, they don't do it properly,' says Trefor Lloyd, who, through the organisation Working With Men, has been helping young men confront issues around masculinity and men's health for 17 years. 'Rather than go to their GP, they're more likely to turn up at casualty or to wait until things get serious. This is obviously inappropriate for them and expensive for the NHS. So there are good economic as well as equal-opportunity arguments for getting men to deal with health issues effectively.' Taking risks and ignoring the results are two sides of the same macho coin. The problem, Lloyd says, lies in the way men are brought up. 'Men are supposed to tough it out. A superhero like Rambo doesn't go to the doctor's, he stitches himself up. Men feel they are expected to cope on their own.' Lessons in being strong and silent have been absorbed by all males - both patients and doctors. 'A consultation between a woman GP and a woman patient will last four times as long as one between a male doctor and a male patient,' says Lloyd. 'Because men don't use the system, primary healthcare doesn't have the experience to cope with them when they do. It can easily misread what men are saying to them.' Lloyd welcomes any initiatives taken to target men about their health, but is wary of approaches that just trawl for men wherever they can be found without evaluating effectiveness. 'Sport and the internet are sometimes seen to be the answer to everything, because there are a lot of men involved in both,' he says. 'But the number of hits on a website, or number of leaflets given out at a football match are no indication of a campaign's success, any more than the number of articles in the press is. If I'm at a match, I'm more interested in the game than prostate cancer, and just because you log on to a site doesn't mean you do anything about it.' Used inappropriately, the internet could do more harm than good. 'Talking in a chatroom may help in the short term,' says Lloyd, 'but in the long term it is compounding the real problem, which is about problems with communicating with real people, the very reason men don't go to their GP in the first place.' Launching alongside the Men's Health Forum website, which is targeted mainly at the increasing number of health and other professionals taking an interest in the subject, will be malehealth.co.uk, a site aimed at men themselves. Editor Peter Baker describes it as 'the first comprehensive in-depth health website for men in the UK and possibly the world'. He feels there's a need to think about men's health in the broadest sense possible. He feels, for example, that the obsession in some men's health writing with the gymnasium and the 'six-pack stomach' does nothing to address the state of mind that makes men reluctant to seek healthcare. 'There's nothing wrong with physical fitness,' he says, 'but the idea that you need a certain body shape to be healthy is daft. It's not good for men's mental health. It increases self-consciousness about body image and sets a standard that is unattainable for most men.' Unattainable and irrelevant. Low income, poor diet, poor air quality, poor housing, inadequate access to services and education - all have a massive impact on health which jogging and press-ups will do little to offset. Of course, these social and environmental factors affect some people more than others and the global mortality figures mask stark class differences. While the mortality gap between men and women is finally narrowing among higher-income groups, it is still widening among those on lower incomes. Life expectancy for a man in social classes 4 and 5 is under 70; for a woman in social classes 1 and 2, it is over 80. Banks wants a more holistic approach. 'Because the Tories saw health as an individual responsibility, public health went down the tubes,' he says. 'It's made such a difference that we can start talking about inequality and social problems again. Even apparently individual problems like smoking have a social dimension - just look at the social groups who tend to smoke. We're also realising that improving men's health will improve women's health, too. After all, women are suffering looking after their sick men.' This government is taking gender inequalities in health seriously and it is putting the causes firmly on the agenda. It has accepted that traditional health- promotion techniques have not reached men and it is looking to organisations such as the Men's Health Forum to help it find new ways. All this makes good political sense. As Ian Banks says: 'Politicians can see the opportunity to make a big impact on the figures with relatively little input.' The challenge will come when the easy things have been done and the gap is still there. Yes, we need to talk to men and yes, we need to persuade them to go to their GP. But once they're there, we need to make them better. Last month's \u00a34.2m injection into prostate-cancer research was a small step in the right direction. There will need to be more. \u0095 Menshealthforum.org.uk. launches on 10 October.

Twice a year, the frequent flyer shows two different collections on the catwalk - his own in London and, across the Atlantic, the luxury cashmere brand TSE New York. If cloning was an option, Chalayan would be first in the queue, not just because he could do with another pair of hands, but because he'd like to know what it was like to be cloned. </p> <p>When he is not in New York or in London, chances are Chalayan is in Istanbul. He travels there five or six times a year, visiting his show sponsor, Turkish textile group IKTIB, which is eager to promote designers of Turkish origin. They could not wish for a better role model than Chalayan for the fledgling talent they are trying to encourage at home. Just seven years since he left college, Chalayan has achieved worldwide acclaim. </p> <p>In July, Time magazine listed him as one of their 100 most influential innovators for the 21st century. He was the only fashion designer, alongside architects, industrial designers and dotcom geniuses. This says a lot about either the snobbery of Time towards fashion as a form of design and innovation, or the elevated status Chalayan has achieved for himself internationally. He is f ted by both the serious architecture and design set, who identify with his conceptual and philosophical approach to fashion (when Zaha Hadid was looking for a designer to create the uniforms for the Millennium Dome, Chalayan was her first stop), and fashion groupies, who simply love his clothes. He has also been nominated as best avant-garde designer by this year's prestigious New York VH1 Awards. In July, American Vogue included him as one of the 12 designers who will change the course of fashion over the next decade. It described him as 'the premier intellectual designer of his generation'. </p> <p>The fuss is well justified. At his best, Hussein Chalayan has the ability to create magic. And he never gives anything but his best. He is a perfectionist to the point of near-madness. His shows are not just feats of creativity, cutting and tailoring, but also of precision-timed choreography, too. Not for him the catwalk with bored-looking models marching into the pop of camera flashbulbs. He has shown in an art gallery in east London, a warehouse in King's Cross, on a go-kart track in south London and the on stage at Sadler's Wells Theatre in Islington. He designs all his own sets, and has elevated the fashion show into performance art. </p> <p>For this autumn, Chalayan created a minimal white room, with table and chairs. As the show progressed, the models stripped the room bare, incorporating the contents - including the furniture - into their clothes. The idea came from seeing news reports about refugees fleeing from Kosovo. 'I come from a part of the world that's turbulent,' he says. 'The collection was about leaving your house in times of war and hiding your possessions. Kosovo was a reminder of what happened in Cyprus.' The audience held its breath as a round table was transformed into a telescopic wooden skirt, and chair covers metamorphosed into dresses. It sounds pretentious - anything to do with the designer's work usually does. But, in reality, the shows are breathtaking; well-executed and brilliantly conceived, as are the clothes themselves. No wonder the fashion world is jamming his phone lines demanding more seats for his show on Wednesday. A change of venue has meant he had to reduce the number of invitations to an intimate 500. </p> <p>Since his graduation show from Central Saint Martins in 1993, when he sculpted a corset out of wood and buried clothes in a garden with iron filings to see how they would rust and decompose, Chalayan has been one of fashion's most challenging designers. His first student collection was promoted in the windows of Browns on South Molton Street, the showcase which launched the career of John Galliano. At the time, Caroline Collis of Browns said: 'He has a real spirit to his work and we felt that, because it was a college show, he wasn't constrained. He wasn't at all concerned with commerciality. It will inevitably come, but what he's produced at this stage is very free, searching and exciting.' The collection was inspired by the 17th-century French philosopher Descartes, and the clothes told the story of a fictional female scientist. </p> <p>I remember interviewing him then. It was 1994. I was a junior fashion writer on The Independent. He was a shy, nervy young man, desperately aware how easily he and his work could be misunderstood. His friend, Bj\u00f6rk, had already adopted him as her favourite clothes designer, wearing his paper clothes on stage. Typically, however, he didn't really want to talk about it. Was he being perverse? Or was he simply trying to keep hold of his integrity? After the portrait session, he insisted on picture approval. It wasn't vanity. He was simply paranoid about the press and how he would be represented. He even turned up at the office and I had to take a selection of prints to show him in the shabby reception area. 'I don't want mass-market appeal,' he said. And he was doing his damnedest not to get it. </p> <p>While Alexander McQueen shocked with his bum cleavages, Chalayan took on the mantle of fashion's Thinker. He quietly experimented. One season, he made an entire collection using Tyvek, the unrippable paper usually reserved for envelopes. Another, he designed dresses with straps that were held in place by balloons filled with helium. He made up narratives in his head and clothed the characters in them. At times, despite the fact that he was living in respectable, right-on Crouch End in north London, he seemed to be on another planet. Ask him why he had designed a particular shape, or why he had made a dress fly like a kite, and he would embark on a long, philosophical discussion. While most fashion designers make your head spin with their flights of fancy, Chalayan would leave you reaching for your Encyclopaedia Britannica . </p> <p>He still does not aspire to reach the mass market, although he has learnt that in order to survive, he has to diversify. Business has been a struggle. The company does not yet own a computer. He has worked with Top Shop, creating a capsule collection of designs for the chain store's more fashion- forward teenagers. And. this autumn, his first pieces for the Marks &amp; Spencer Autograph range have arrived on the shop floor, although they will not be branded as his designs. He began designing a luxury cashmere collection for TSE New York, which added weight to Chalayan's profile in the States, but seemingly still acting as a subsidy for his own label. Slowly, he has been expanding into extra space in his Covent Garden headquarters. His own office is simple: white-washed with a basic office desk and chair. Nothing fancy. He is not interested in the trappings of the designer lifestyle. </p> <p>Chalayan has just turned 30. It's 18 years since he moved from his home in Nicosia in northern Cyprus to England, where he was enrolled at Highgate Boys' School in north London. For a shy young teenager, with an exotic-sounding name that no one could pronounce, it was just another battleground, at times lonely and brutal. 'We were told as kids in Cyprus that when you eat something, you always offer it to someone else first,' he says, and remembers thinking it was mean of the children at school that they never offered around their bags of crisps. </p> <p>It wasn't until he was 17 that Chalayan became aware of the fact that there was such a thing as a degree in fashion design. 'I was always interested in clothing the body, but didn't know there was a course you could do.' He had decided on a future as an architect. But when he read a magazine article about the Turkish designer Rifat Ozbek, he discovered the fashion degree at Saint Martins School of Art and Design. At that point, his future suddenly became a little clearer. </p> <p>If Chalayan's parents had not separated when he was a child, he may well have spent his student days in Istanbul University rather than in the ramshackle studios of Central Saint Martins on London's Charing Cross Road. As a child, he lived close to the frontline between north and south Cyprus. 'There was a real border culture. You are living in mystery and don't know what's on the other side.' And of course, that was precisely what the young Chalayan wanted to know. Perhaps that explains why he is so very inquisitive. His process of designing is the result of a constant quest to learn more, whether it's philosophy, religion or science and technology. He has a habit of deflecting questions back on his interviewers, and always asks more questions than he answers. 'I'm just a very curious person,' he says. 'I've always been inquisitive, wanting to learn about new things. The more you live, the more you realise you don't know.' </p> <p>One subject that interests Chalayan is Islam. For his spring/summer 1998 collection, he created one of his most provocative images. The show ended with a line-up of six models. The first wore a chador, which covered most of her body and allowed a gap just for her eyes. Each veil became shorter and shorter until, finally, the last one was nude apart from a mask covering her face. 'It was about defining your cultural territory,' he says. 'How a group of people define their territory with their clothes. The covering of the body was also representative of death, the veil bringing the body to a mummy-like state. It is a deathly state. You're pretending you don't exist. By becoming an anonymous person, you are creating your own territory. It was such a powerful show - so moving for me.' </p> <p>The designer is interested in breaking barriers. That is why he came up with the idea to photograph diverse families living in Istanbul and reproduce them in a limited- edition book to be given away at his show and sold in aid of Turkish charities. 'Istanbul breaks a lot of rules,' he says. 'It's not what you think it is. The diversity is rich and exciting. People think it's an Islamic state, but its incredibly secular. As I get older, I realise how many more undiscovered things there are in this part of the world.' </p> <p>Although he is Cypriot by birth, Chalayan is fascinated by Istanbul, its geographical position straddling Europe and Asia, and its cultural diversity. 'It is my favourite European city,' he says. Recently, he designed a dress for one of Turkey's most popular singers, Sezen Aksu. On Thursday morning, the Turkish newspapers will feature his London show. And after his show on Wednesday night, the TV crews will be lining up for their two minutes of air time with Chalayan backstage. Although he doesn't yet sell so much as a T-shirt in Istanbul, the city has adopted him as its own. He's happy to be their golden boy. </p> <p>Whenever he goes he makes sure he pays a visit to Mete and Nadire Goktug, an architect couple who have lovingly restored the ruin of an old British jail and turned the ground and first floors into a teashop. The top floor has a studio room with a wall of glass on one side. Occasionally, they entertain there, and sometimes spend the night, although they actually live somewhere else. </p> <p>Food is one of the designer's favourite subjects. His list of things to see and do in Istanbul does not start with the Blue Mosque or the Haghia Sophia, but a fish restaurant by the Bosphorus, or a traditional Turkish restaurant, whose specialities include a variety of weeds. 'The Galata tearoom has the most amazing atmosphere,' says Chalayan. 'And you have to try the man-ti! They are like Turkish dim-sum, little parcels of meat or potato. They serve it with yoghurt.' Sure enough, the steaming bowl of potato man-ti is delicious. Nadire will read your fortune after you've finished with your tiny cup of strong, black Turkish coffee. Chalayan admits to being very superstitious. 'I have a belief that if you don't do something in a certain way, things won't be right. I think I do things to prevent certain things happening, and believe some actions might bring bad luck.' </p> <p>It is unexpected to hear Chalayan talk of such things as superstition. Looking at his clothes, you would expect him to be completely rational and logical at all times. But he says it is all part of his cultural background. 'I'm more of an instinctive and emotionally oriented person,' he says. 'I was brought up to focus on my emotions and be in touch with them. That is how my background affects my work. I refer to Turkish costumes at times. But it's more to do with my childhood and how I was brought up.' </p> <p>He is, to put it mildly, a very complex character - totally dedicated to his work, and absolutely single-minded in its execution. His vision of the world, as expressed by the more extreme and conceptual pieces in his collections, is certainly a unique and uncompromising one. It is difficult to define the abstract workings of Chalayan's brain. But as long as those cogs keep turning, churning up visions of Islam, superstitions, philosphies, scientific formulae, memories of war and the breaking down of borders, Hussein Chalayan will continue to inspire and be inspired. And the fashion world is left hanging in the balance, waiting to see what magic he will weave next.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Arpad Toth lights yet another cigarette and slumps heavily into a padded swivel chair. On the other side of the sliding glass doors at the far end of the room, darkness is falling. Momentarily, he raises his head and gazes balefully out at his disappearing garden. It was all going to be so perfect. It was going to be Eden. Now his five-year-old son is buried out there.</p> <p>'I used to carry around this cyanide and I'll tell you, there were times when I was seconds away from... it looked like sugar. Looked exactly like sugar. Here, do you want some? You can have as much as you like...'</p> <p>He's smiling with his mouth, but not with his eyes, and I'm struck by the contrast between the muffled detonation of a man's soul and the fireworks on the Paulsgrove Estate in Portsmouth this summer, where cars were burnt and houses sacked and children carried placards screeching 'KILL THE BASTARDS' and chanted, 'Sex case, sex case: hang 'em, hang 'em, hang 'em' in reference to the faceless paedophile who is presumed to have taken Sarah Payne from her family. These two scenes, seemingly a universe apart, are about the same thing. This has been the summer of the dead child.</p> <p>We're sitting in a park on the outskirts of Croydon on a sunny September morning. Thirty feet away, a dozen or so small children are being entertained by a clown. The air is light with laughter and mums smirk as they hover watchfully in the background.</p> <p>'She's one of the better entertainers,' says Dee Warner. 'The ones we've had recently have been pretty bad. Even the kids noticed.'</p> <p>A conversation with Warner can be unsettling. One of the children giggling at the clown is her five-year-old son, Harry, while four-month-old Ellie sleeps in her pram. Our attention moves seamlessly between them and the unspeakable horror that is an everyday part of their mother's life. She and her friend Lynn Costello run the organisation Mothers Against Murder and Aggression, and the stories she carries around with her are shocking.</p> <p>There's the pair of 15-year-old girls seized by a gang of boys, taken to a barn, raped and set alight, then trammelled and scattered by firefighters who had no idea they were there; the parents whose daughter was knifed by a jealous schoolmate, whose only son then committed suicide next to a note indicating that he wanted to be with his sister. The man whose 10-year-old son and wife were beaten to death with a sledgehammer the day after the boy's birthday. The children taken and murdered by paedophiles and 'care in the community' psychiatric patients.</p> <p>It's lurid, horrendous, frightening stuff, and the examples given here are far from the worst. Warner and Costello formed MAMAA after James Bulger was killed by two 10-year-olds in 1993. They didn't have specific aims then, they just wanted to channel the despair they felt at a child being obliterated by other children. Now they run a helpline for the parents of murder victims from Warner's scrupulously tidy ex-local authority house on the edge of a pleasant estate. They also campaign for victims' rights and harsher punishments for offenders and supported the Paulsgrove protesters. What I want to know is how she lives with all this horror. And why?</p> <p>'Yeah, my brother-in-law says I'm paranoid,' she begins. 'He says I act like someone hanging around on every street corner waiting to take your child away. But I mean, what was the chance of Sarah Payne having a row with her brother and walking off? Sophie Hook was in her own back garden. People say I shouldn't make Harry so aware, but I'm afraid he is. When we did all the campaigning around [convicted paedophile] Sidney Cooke coming out, if he saw a picture of Sidney Cooke, he'd say, \"That man's really horrible and if you see him you should shout and shout and don't go with him.\" My sister said, \"Oh, my God...\" But what if he does see him?</p> <p>'And the scary thing is that with the \"name and shame\" thing, I showed Harry the photographs and he said, \"They don't look horrible, Mummy.\" I said, \"Well, that's the trouble, Harry, they don't always look horrible.\" People tell us that not all paedophiles murder, but they murder childhoods.'</p> <p>This is certainly true, but as I walk to my car, two things are running through my head. The first is a conversation I'd had with a child psychologist, who told me that an excess of fear can destroy childhoods, too. The second concerns a set of statistics supplied by the Home Office, which show that the number of children under the age of 10 who are known to be killed by strangers is astonishingly small.</p> <p>In 1994, there were none, while 1995 and 1996 saw two each, and the figures have remained more or less constant since figures became available. Most children are murdered and/or abused by people they know, usually relatives. Anyone who seriously wants to protect children might like to consider abolishing the family. These facts have been widely reported: we're aware of them, but it doesn't appear to help. My suspicion is that this is because, on the whole, we don't want it to.</p> <p>The fact is that something like 12,000 children under the age of 19 die each year. And nightmarish though Sidney Cooke is, even he can't match that. In this context, monsters become a soothing chimera, because monsters can be avoided, if we're good: the random horror of the world cannot. The problem is that the stories which have transfixed us this summer have had the effect of making child death seem at once palpitatingly present, yet also distant, freakish, unreal, little more than another opportunity for collective catharsis. Will Barbie be evicted from Big Brother ? Will the abducted girl die? These national cliffhangers are received in the same way, through the same media, and our collective responses look remarkably similar.</p> <p>The horror is increased, while the suffering is distanced. As one expert at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital scowled when asked to consider the idea that death is at least being brought out into the open: 'Yes, but if faced with a reality that's in danger of becoming too personalised, people still run a mile. The reality is as difficult as it ever was.'</p> <p>What follows is something of that reality.</p> <p>I'd heard and read a lot about Arpad Toth and his remarkable battle with the General Medical Council (GMC) following the unnecessary death of his son, but the man stalking across the drive to meet me was not what I'd expected. He is stocky and initially wary, a little spiky and nervous, prone to launch into lectures -almost any subject will do - at moments of discomfort. He built this drive, and the country house it leads to, and the stables and professional recording studio which take up most of the ground floor. Like a lot of perfectionists, he dresses his vulnerability with rigour, layers and layers of rigour - but a boy-like intensity radiates from his bleached-blue eyes and there is an agile, oppositional caste to his mind that is seldom less than entertaining. I found myself liking him very much. What I'd been told was true. You don't forget having met Toth.</p> <p>Now 47, his earliest memory is of watching tanks roll through the streets of Budapest from the balcony of his mother's apartment block. They escaped to England, where his mother married a fellow refugee, an art dealer. Arpad trained as an electrical engineer and worked as a technician at Oxford University before coming here. Eric Clapton and Radiohead recorded in the studio he built, and everything was progressing according to plan until his girlfriend informed him that she was pregnant. He was furious until his son, Wilfred, arrived, then fell in love in the hopeless, bewildered way that reluctant fathers often do.</p> <p>His boy was healthy, but had a congenital illness, a condition Toth describes as the inverse of diabetes, which meant that his body was capable of manufacturing and storing glucose in the liver, but couldn't retrieve it. The brain runs on glucose, so care had to be taken to ensure that Wilfred was given small but frequent feeds of carbohydrate or sugar. There had to be enough for his needs, but not so much as to burden the liver with excess supplies. It was a delicate balance to strike.</p> <p>The difficulty came at night, when the only way to regulate Wilfred's glucose intake was through a naso-gastric tube attached to a peristaltic pump. The system worked, but the pump had a serious design flaw in that once it had been set and the start button pressed, the only clear way to establish that it was working was to watch it for a period of time. Toth claims to have been close to finding a more reliable way of administering the glucose his son needed, when, on the morning of 9 October 1993, everything went wrong.</p> <p>Grimly but evenly, Toth describes the crisis which engulfed his family. That night, Wilfred's mother, a senior nurse who was six months pregnant with a second child, laid him in his usual place, between the spaces she and her husband would occupy in bed. She armed the pump and pressed the start button, but that night it didn't come on. Arpad came to bed early for him, at 2.30am, and watched satellite news, as was his habit, until he fell asleep. She rose early and fixed herself some coffee and was sitting up watching TV and reading the papers when Wilfred went into a violent hypoglycaemic fit. She woke her partner. According to them, it was now about 7.15am. They called their doctor's surgery and gave the boy some powdered glucose, which appeared to have no effect. What he needed was intravenous glucose.</p> <p>In their version, the doctor took an age to reach this very serious situation, then refused to administer the intravenous solution, instead offering barbiturates to control the fitting. Toth blames himself for his 'moment of doubt', during which he briefly lacked the confidence to insist that he knew better than a doctor who was about to do the wrong thing. Eventually, the GP called the local hospital in order to have Wilfred admitted 'for observation', then left. By the time the family arrived, manic and terrified, the brain damage caused by Wilfred's starvation of glucose was irreparable, and he never recovered from his coma. Toth turned off the life-support machine a week later, and the boy died in his arms.</p> <p>He took his complaint against his GP to the GMC and it was thrown out at the first hurdle, though if they'd known who they were dealing with, they might have reconsidered their haste. In the meantime, in his grief he refused to relinquish Wilfred to anyone. He took him home, called his friends round and they dug a huge hole in the frozen, wintry garden and plastered the walls and carpeted the floor until it looked like a scaled-down version of his son's room, Thomas the Tank Engine bed and all. One night, his partner came home and found the distraught Toth out there with a shovel, trying to rejoin his boy. When a daughter was born eight weeks later, in the same room in the same hospital as Wilfred, and a few doors away from the place where he died, her father could barely bring himself to acknowledge her presence.</p> <p>He blamed the doctor, his partner, himself, the universe. If there was still any kind of plot, he lost it, just wanted to exchange his grief for nothingness. He speaks of those early years with a kind of eerie detachment.</p> <p>'I think the only thing that stopped me from ending it then was that I thought, \"Christ, if I do this, I'll be betraying my son's memory.\" I gave in. I couldn't stand up to the powers that be. Then you think, \"Well, even if I make this statement, who would care? If they didn't care when my boy died, why the hell would they care when I die?\" So at times like that, I just went, \"Fuck it, I'm going to make a difference.\" And having suffered the ultimate insult, there's not a hell of a lot they can do to me any more, but there's a hell of a lot I can do in return.'</p> <p>I'd asked Arpad Toth whether he'd had anyone to confide in about all this. He'd replied that, no, he didn't; he'd felt alone, isolated, cut adrift from the rest of humanity. This is something you'll hear other parents say and which I caught a glimpse of on the train down to the Demelza House Children's Hospice in Sittingbourne, Kent.</p> <p>I was reading a leaflet giving details of an intense-sounding weekend course aimed at helping children come to terms with the death of relatives. At the end of it were some comments from participants and their guardians. One ran: 'My child was surprised to find other children in the same situation. When he told his story, he was really amazed that the other children did not laugh.' I must have appeared troubled by this, because I looked up to find the girl sitting next to me shifting her gaze uncomfortably and the woman opposite doing likewise. They'd seen what I was reading. They thought I'd lost a child - at least that's what I thought they thought - and a voice deep inside me wanted to say, 'No. No, I haven't. I'm OK. I'm like you.'</p> <p>I'm OK? And then I knew: we're afraid of people in this situation. We don't know what to say and fear the bleak force of the emotions involved, as though, in allowing them to enter us, we might conjure them into reality. If we infantilised inhabitants of the 21st century only relate to things we can identify with, the converse is also true: if we don't want to be identified with something, we shun it.</p> <p>Demelza House is a joyous place, with verdant grounds and everything a child with a terminal illness needs in order to be the careless scamp they deserve to be at this stage of life. Yet if you ask the staff how their jobs are perceived outside of their immediate environment, you will hear the same thing again and again. 'People either seem to see us as angels or lunatics,' says administrator Liz Johnson. 'And the effect on strangers when you tell them what you do can be astonishing. Conversations just stop. It's as though you've just told them you have leprosy. We tend to stick quite close to each other around here.'</p> <p>Staff on the Child Death Helpline at Great Ormond Street will tell you that people they call simply don't hear the word 'death' in their title. They hear 'deaf' or 'deer' or 'deb', or simply nothing at all ('Child wha'?') - anything but the reality. The few who do hear tend to gasp and try to get off the phone. The line has been going for five years, is staffed mostly by volunteers who've lost children and if you really want to know what the reality of the experience is, this is the place to visit.</p> <p>Anna, a volunteer, lost a 14-year-old son to leukaemia.'Most of us go through life assuming this will happen to someone else, and not beginning to understand what it's like. People feel huge sympathy, but just don't know what to say. Unfortunately, I think that one of the things which has come from all the reporting of children dying is that people suddenly become authorities on it and will try to demonstrate this to you, that they understand what you're going through. But they don't, they can't. And then in a month or so, they'll say, \"I expect you're feeling better now.\" People can get carried away on the wave of the feeling, or what they think this feeling is, and all these publicised tragedies have encouraged people to think that this is their way of being a part of that, you know. And they have no idea. You find yourself thinking, \"Why are you doing this? Just go about your business, maybe say a little prayer and be thankful it's not you...\"'</p> <p>So what does she say?</p> <p>'When you get a first-time caller and you're suddenly faced with this thing that has happened, my stomach immediately goes and the only thing I can say is, \"I'm just so sorry.\" Because I am. Just so sorry. People, I think, do find it hard to say that. It sounds trite, but sometimes it's all you can say.'</p> <p>Anna and her colleagues all talk of the isolation, the guilt, the blame, the anger, the fear for their other children and the loss of trust in the world, the complete loss of confidence, broken relationships, sense of helplessness and failure; the way you try to protect other members of your family and compensate for friends' discomfort, and the pressure this puts on you. The anniversaries, the pain when other children or grandchildren reach and pass the age at which yours died. The fact that your child, to one degree or another, had to make their final journey on their own. If the death was violent, there may be elements of post-traumatic stress - flashbacks, nightmares, imaginings of the fear the child might have felt. You never 'get over it', and there is no resolution. All you can do is learn to accommodate the loss, says coordinator Jean Simmons. The old five-stage models of grief, which purport to culminate in some sort of transcendence, she adds, are a waste of time.</p> <p>'We don't find those old linear models, in which you help people through certain stages until they can let go and resolve, helpful. We think it's more about holding on, finding ways to incorporate the loved person into your everyday existence, to recognise how they changed you and the influence they continue to have on your life and relationships.</p> <p>'Here, they won't be pathologised. The death of a child is special because, fortunately, not many will experience it. Nevertheless, there is a fear of bereaved people in society, which is strange, because it will happen to everybody at some stage, yet we treat it as if it were a pox. I think that's why they tend to be rushed off to counsellors. The pain is dealt with as an individual psychological response, but this is not something that's gone wrong with the bereaved individual - their response is normal and natural. The problem, often, is around them.'</p> <p>I wanted someone to tell me that the pain ends and things are all right in the end, but I'm not hearing that. No wonder we're scared of this stuff.</p> <p>Toth didn't believe in counselling either. Chain-smoking in his studio late into the night, he veers between sounding like Hamlet and General Patten as he describes his seven-year journey to here. Everything has changed. His relationship with his partner and daughter never recovered, for a start.</p> <p>'I suppose we never quite came back to each other,' he says quietly. 'Something's changed - I can't put my finger on it. And every time I look at my son's picture, I think, \"Christ, here we are seven years on, and I haven't achieved anything yet.\" I mean, I've achieved this, but it's still not enough.'</p> <p>By 'this', Toth means a famous victory he has just won over the GMC in the High Court, which could have far-reaching consequences for many, many people. According to his lawyer, Lee Ranford of Russell-Cooke Potter &amp; Chapman, 98 per cent of complaints brought to the GMC have hitherto failed, with an astonishing 90 per cent being rejected at the initial 'screening' stage. Now the organisation, whose motto is 'protecting patients, guiding doctors' ('We think it's been the reverse up to now,' says Ranford), has to have 'compelling reasons' for throwing out a complaint at this first stage, and must justify its decision, disclosing the evidence used to reach it. Toth has dozens of legal binders from the actions he has 'been forced' to bring against a range of parties.</p> <p>He appears to have been treated badly and can now re-animate his complaint against the GP involved in his son's case. He thinks that the same is true for many thousands of previous complainants and that, if even some of them make use of this new opportunity, the GMC would not be able to cope and would have to be replaced by an official body that could. Undeniably, this is an extraordinary thing that Toth has done, and there would appear to be plenty more to come.</p> <p>But what happens when the legal distractions are over and Arpad is just left with Arpad? I have to ask the question four times before he will give an answer that doesn't involve proceedings of some kind.</p> <p>'Well... it's something for me to do, isn't it. What I really like doing, what I've done all my life, is... I like inventing things. I like writing my music. I like doing my gardening. I don't really need to socialise. I'm quite happy with my own company and just dipping in and out of society as I need to. And I'd like a peaceful life. I don't want to be in strife all the time. But I find that nobody else is doing it. Nobody else is saying, \"I'm there for you.\"'</p> <p>Does the pain ever lessen?</p> <p>'No. Not really. You have flashbacks. You have dreams. You wish you could turn the clock back. If only I did something different. If only I didn't have that moment of doubt. It's a constant source of torment. You're faced with these people telling you they know and eventually you think, \"Maybe I am being hysterical, overreacting, losing my marbles,\" and eventually you cave in. And of course, death comes almost instantaneously and then you realise, \"Oh my God, I can't change my mind. In the space of one or two seconds, everything went, and there's no turning back.\" And even now I wake up in the middle of the night and say, \"Oh, he's here! Oh no, fucking hell, he ain't. It was a dream.\"</p> <p>'To lose a child is worse than losing a parent. It's unnatural, especially when it was avoidable. So you can't even inure yourself to the possibility, because the thought is too horrendous. So I think what'll probably happen is that this'll never finish. Even when the case against the doctor is concluded, I think that probably my path is set. I will always be there for the underdog. To try and change the system. Maybe one day I might even do something that will make it a bit more fair.'</p> <p>Arpad is slowing. I'm watching him dissolve like a snowman in the rain. 'You know, occasionally, when one of the animals died - a cat or a sheep - he made me promise that I would never die. Silly little thing. Then it turns out...'</p> <p>I'm wondering what to take from all this as I leave the Child Death Helpline offices and cross the road for a tour of Great Ormond Street Hospital. Like Demelza House, it is a buoyant, optimistic place, where thousands of children are being helped, cured, made more comfortable. Even here, though, the range of emotion you encounter makes your head swim. The horror is never far away. Outside, I'd passed a man and woman standing, he with his arms around her, each staring into some cruel and private distance, simply looking stranded.</p> <p>In the chapel, a big book where people can set down thoughts or prayers contained many entries along the lines of 'Please help me through my op. Charlotte, age 7' and 'Please help my friend Lynn.' One mother wrote a daily account of how her daughter's operations were going and you could feel her mood swing from hope to desperation to relief to anxiety, her girl's pain playing her like a game of poker. The entry that followed me home, though, simply read: 'Lord hear our cries and have mercy on my son. Please keep him safe in your arms forever.'</p> <p>Then, in the cancer ward, the revelation, as I watched a little girl of six or seven struggle through a door with a mobile drip which was so much bigger than she, then wrestle it grimly down the corridor. She'd lost her hair, presumably as a consequence of chemotherapy, and her face was misshapen, distended, with harrowed eyes wide with determination. You looked at her and your only possible thought was, 'This is not right. It shouldn't be happening,' at which point you either burst into tears or pull your jacket over your head, crouch to the floor and hop around like Basil Fawlty impersonating a frog. Neither, it is fair to assume, would be of much help.</p> <p>The thing is, we expect to be able to protect our children. We lead them to believe that we will, and in the main we do, but their childhood ends the day we no longer can, or will, and so does any echo of our own. In the adult world, joy tends to be anticipated, where horror drops out of the sky. We want the opposite for kids, for horror to be seen in advance and susceptible to control, while joy just happens. And we can't have that.</p> <p>Jean Simmons had told me that one of the most agonising decisions parents face when a child dies is what to dress them in for the funeral. 'They nearly always talk about dressing the child warmly,' she said. 'They're afraid they'll be cold.' And then it struck me that we're only here on loan to our children, and they to us.</p> <p>And that all the horror I've seen and been told about only has force because it corresponds to love. I decided to go home and take the kids to the park and hand this article in late.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Arpad Toth lights yet another cigarette and slumps heavily into a padded swivel chair. On the other side of the sliding glass doors at the far end of the room, darkness is falling. Momentarily, he raises his head and gazes balefully out at his disappearing garden. It was all going to be so perfect. It was going to be Eden. Now his five-year-old son is buried out there. 'I used to carry around this cyanide and I'll tell you, there were times when I was seconds away from... it looked like sugar. Looked exactly like sugar. Here, do you want some? You can have as much as you like...' He's smiling with his mouth, but not with his eyes, and I'm struck by the contrast between the muffled detonation of a man's soul and the fireworks on the Paulsgrove Estate in Portsmouth this summer, where cars were burnt and houses sacked and children carried placards screeching 'KILL THE BASTARDS' and chanted, 'Sex case, sex case: hang 'em, hang 'em, hang 'em' in reference to the faceless paedophile who is presumed to have taken Sarah Payne from her family. These two scenes, seemingly a universe apart, are about the same thing. This has been the summer of the dead child. We're sitting in a park on the outskirts of Croydon on a sunny September morning. Thirty feet away, a dozen or so small children are being entertained by a clown. The air is light with laughter and mums smirk as they hover watchfully in the background. 'She's one of the better entertainers,' says Dee Warner. 'The ones we've had recently have been pretty bad. Even the kids noticed.' A conversation with Warner can be unsettling. One of the children giggling at the clown is her five-year-old son, Harry, while four-month-old Ellie sleeps in her pram. Our attention moves seamlessly between them and the unspeakable horror that is an everyday part of their mother's life. She and her friend Lynn Costello run the organisation Mothers Against Murder and Aggression, and the stories she carries around with her are shocking. There's the pair of 15-year-old girls seized by a gang of boys, taken to a barn, raped and set alight, then trammelled and scattered by firefighters who had no idea they were there; the parents whose daughter was knifed by a jealous schoolmate, whose only son then committed suicide next to a note indicating that he wanted to be with his sister. The man whose 10-year-old son and wife were beaten to death with a sledgehammer the day after the boy's birthday. The children taken and murdered by paedophiles and 'care in the community' psychiatric patients. It's lurid, horrendous, frightening stuff, and the examples given here are far from the worst. Warner and Costello formed MAMAA after James Bulger was killed by two 10-year-olds in 1993. They didn't have specific aims then, they just wanted to channel the despair they felt at a child being obliterated by other children. Now they run a helpline for the parents of murder victims from Warner's scrupulously tidy ex-local authority house on the edge of a pleasant estate. They also campaign for victims' rights and harsher punishments for offenders and supported the Paulsgrove protesters. What I want to know is how she lives with all this horror. And why? 'Yeah, my brother-in-law says I'm paranoid,' she begins. 'He says I act like someone hanging around on every street corner waiting to take your child away. But I mean, what was the chance of Sarah Payne having a row with her brother and walking off? Sophie Hook was in her own back garden. People say I shouldn't make Harry so aware, but I'm afraid he is. When we did all the campaigning around [convicted paedophile] Sidney Cooke coming out, if he saw a picture of Sidney Cooke, he'd say, \"That man's really horrible and if you see him you should shout and shout and don't go with him.\" My sister said, \"Oh, my God...\" But what if he does see him? 'And the scary thing is that with the \"name and shame\" thing, I showed Harry the photographs and he said, \"They don't look horrible, Mummy.\" I said, \"Well, that's the trouble, Harry, they don't always look horrible.\" People tell us that not all paedophiles murder, but they murder childhoods.' This is certainly true, but as I walk to my car, two things are running through my head. The first is a conversation I'd had with a child psychologist, who told me that an excess of fear can destroy childhoods, too. The second concerns a set of statistics supplied by the Home Office, which show that the number of children under the age of 10 who are known to be killed by strangers is astonishingly small. In 1994, there were none, while 1995 and 1996 saw two each, and the figures have remained more or less constant since figures became available. Most children are murdered and/or abused by people they know, usually relatives. Anyone who seriously wants to protect children might like to consider abolishing the family.

The problem is that the stories which have transfixed us this summer have had the effect of making child death seem at once palpitatingly present, yet also distant, freakish, unreal, little more than another opportunity for collective catharsis. Will Barbie be evicted from Big Brother ? Will the abducted girl die? These national cliffhangers are received in the same way, through the same media, and our collective responses look remarkably similar. The horror is increased, while the suffering is distanced. As one expert at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital scowled when asked to consider the idea that death is at least being brought out into the open: 'Yes, but if faced with a reality that's in danger of becoming too personalised, people still run a mile.

I'd heard and read a lot about Arpad Toth and his remarkable battle with the General Medical Council (GMC) following the unnecessary death of his son, but the man stalking across the drive to meet me was not what I'd expected. He is stocky and initially wary, a little spiky and nervous, prone to launch into lectures -almost any subject will do - at moments of discomfort. He built this drive, and the country house it leads to, and the stables and professional recording studio which take up most of the ground floor. Like a lot of perfectionists, he dresses his vulnerability with rigour, layers and layers of rigour - but a boy-like intensity radiates from his bleached-blue eyes and there is an agile, oppositional caste to his mind that is seldom less than entertaining. I found myself liking him very much. What I'd been told was true. You don't forget having met Toth. Now 47, his earliest memory is of watching tanks roll through the streets of Budapest from the balcony of his mother's apartment block.

I was reading a leaflet giving details of an intense-sounding weekend course aimed at helping children come to terms with the death of relatives. At the end of it were some comments from participants and their guardians. One ran: 'My child was surprised to find other children in the same situation. When he told his story, he was really amazed that the other children did not laugh.' I must have appeared troubled by this, because I looked up to find the girl sitting next to me shifting her gaze uncomfortably and the woman opposite doing likewise. They'd seen what I was reading. They thought I'd lost a child - at least that's what I thought they thought - and a voice deep inside me wanted to say, 'No. No, I haven't. I'm OK. I'm like you.' I'm OK? And then I knew: we're afraid of people in this situation. We don't know what to say and fear the bleak force of the emotions involved, as though, in allowing them to enter us, we might conjure them into reality. If we infantilised inhabitants of the 21st century only relate to things we can identify with, the converse is also true: if we don't want to be identified with something, we shun it. Demelza House is a joyous place, with verdant grounds and everything a child with a terminal illness needs in order to be the careless scamp they deserve to be at this stage of life. Yet if you ask the staff how their jobs are perceived outside of their immediate environment, you will hear the same thing again and again. 'People either seem to see us as angels or lunatics,' says administrator Liz Johnson. 'And the effect on strangers when you tell them what you do can be astonishing. Conversations just stop. It's as though you've just told them you have leprosy. We tend to stick quite close to each other around here.' Staff on the Child Death Helpline at Great Ormond Street will tell you that people they call simply don't hear the word 'death' in their title. They hear 'deaf' or 'deer' or 'deb', or simply nothing at all ('Child wha'?') - anything but the reality. The few who do hear tend to gasp and try to get off the phone. The line has been going for five years, is staffed mostly by volunteers who've lost children and if you really want to know what the reality of the experience is, this is the place to visit. Anna, a volunteer, lost a 14-year-old son to leukaemia.'Most of us go through life assuming this will happen to someone else, and not beginning to understand what it's like. People feel huge sympathy, but just don't know what to say. Unfortunately, I think that one of the things which has come from all the reporting of children dying is that people suddenly become authorities on it and will try to demonstrate this to you, that they understand what you're going through. But they don't, they can't. And then in a month or so, they'll say, \"I expect you're feeling better now.\" People can get carried away on the wave of the feeling, or what they think this feeling is, and all these publicised tragedies have encouraged people to think that this is their way of being a part of that, you know. And they have no idea. You find yourself thinking, \"Why are you doing this? Just go about your business, maybe say a little prayer and be thankful it's not you...\"' So what does she say? 'When you get a first-time caller and you're suddenly faced with this thing that has happened, my stomach immediately goes and the only thing I can say is, \"I'm just so sorry.\" Because I am. Just so sorry. People, I think, do find it hard to say that. It sounds trite, but sometimes it's all you can say.' Anna and her colleagues all talk of the isolation, the guilt, the blame, the anger, the fear for their other children and the loss of trust in the world, the complete loss of confidence, broken relationships, sense of helplessness and failure; the way you try to protect other members of your family and compensate for friends' discomfort, and the pressure this puts on you. The anniversaries, the pain when other children or grandchildren reach and pass the age at which yours died. The fact that your child, to one degree or another, had to make their final journey on their own. If the death was violent, there may be elements of post-traumatic stress - flashbacks, nightmares, imaginings of the fear the child might have felt. You never 'get over it', and there is no resolution. All you can do is learn to accommodate the loss, says coordinator Jean Simmons. The old five-stage models of grief, which purport to culminate in some sort of transcendence, she adds, are a waste of time. 'We don't find those old linear models, in which you help people through certain stages until they can let go and resolve, helpful. We think it's more about holding on, finding ways to incorporate the loved person into your everyday existence, to recognise how they changed you and the influence they continue to have on your life and relationships. 'Here, they won't be pathologised. The death of a child is special because, fortunately, not many will experience it. Nevertheless, there is a fear of bereaved people in society, which is strange, because it will happen to everybody at some stage, yet we treat it as if it were a pox. I think that's why they tend to be rushed off to counsellors. The pain is dealt with as an individual psychological response, but this is not something that's gone wrong with the bereaved individual - their response is normal and natural. The problem, often, is around them.' I wanted someone to tell me that the pain ends and things are all right in the end, but I'm not hearing that. No wonder we're scared of this stuff. Toth didn't believe in counselling either. Chain-smoking in his studio late into the night, he veers between sounding like Hamlet and General Patten as he describes his seven-year journey to here. Everything has changed. His relationship with his partner and daughter never recovered, for a start. 'I suppose we never quite came back to each other,' he says quietly. 'Something's changed - I can't put my finger on it. And every time I look at my son's picture, I think, \"Christ, here we are seven years on, and I haven't achieved anything yet.\" I mean, I've achieved this, but it's still not enough.' By 'this', Toth means a famous victory he has just won over the GMC in the High Court, which could have far-reaching consequences for many, many people. According to his lawyer, Lee Ranford of Russell-Cooke Potter &amp; Chapman, 98 per cent of complaints brought to the GMC have hitherto failed, with an astonishing 90 per cent being rejected at the initial 'screening' stage. Now the organisation, whose motto is 'protecting patients, guiding doctors' ('We think it's been the reverse up to now,' says Ranford), has to have 'compelling reasons' for throwing out a complaint at this first stage, and must justify its decision, disclosing the evidence used to reach it. Toth has dozens of legal binders from the actions he has 'been forced' to bring against a range of parties. He appears to have been treated badly and can now re-animate his complaint against the GP involved in his son's case. He thinks that the same is true for many thousands of previous complainants and that, if even some of them make use of this new opportunity, the GMC would not be able to cope and would have to be replaced by an official body that could. Undeniably, this is an extraordinary thing that Toth has done, and there would appear to be plenty more to come. But what happens when the legal distractions are over and Arpad is just left with Arpad? I have to ask the question four times before he will give an answer that doesn't involve proceedings of some kind. 'Well... it's something for me to do, isn't it. What I really like doing, what I've done all my life, is... I like inventing things. I like writing my music. I like doing my gardening. I don't really need to socialise. I'm quite happy with my own company and just dipping in and out of society as I need to. And I'd like a peaceful life. I don't want to be in strife all the time. But I find that nobody else is doing it. Nobody else is saying, \"I'm there for you.\"' Does the pain ever lessen? 'No. Not really. You have flashbacks. You have dreams. You wish you could turn the clock back. If only I did something different. If only I didn't have that moment of doubt. It's a constant source of torment. You're faced with these people telling you they know and eventually you think, \"Maybe I am being hysterical, overreacting, losing my marbles,\" and eventually you cave in. And of course, death comes almost instantaneously and then you realise, \"Oh my God, I can't change my mind. In the space of one or two seconds, everything went, and there's no turning back.\" And even now I wake up in the middle of the night and say, \"Oh, he's here! Oh no, fucking hell, he ain't. It was a dream.\" 'To lose a child is worse than losing a parent. It's unnatural, especially when it was avoidable. So you can't even inure yourself to the possibility, because the thought is too horrendous. So I think what'll probably happen is that this'll never finish. Even when the case against the doctor is concluded, I think that probably my path is set. I will always be there for the underdog. To try and change the system. Maybe one day I might even do something that will make it a bit more fair.' Arpad is slowing. I'm watching him dissolve like a snowman in the rain. 'You know, occasionally, when one of the animals died - a cat or a sheep - he made me promise that I would never die. Silly little thing. Then it turns out...' I'm wondering what to take from all this as I leave the Child Death Helpline offices and cross the road for a tour of Great Ormond Street Hospital. Like Demelza House, it is a buoyant, optimistic place, where thousands of children are being helped, cured, made more comfortable. Even here, though, the range of emotion you encounter makes your head swim. The horror is never far away. Outside, I'd passed a man and woman standing, he with his arms around her, each staring into some cruel and private distance, simply looking stranded. In the chapel, a big book where people can set down thoughts or prayers contained many entries along the lines of 'Please help me through my op. Charlotte, age 7' and 'Please help my friend Lynn.' One mother wrote a daily account of how her daughter's operations were going and you could feel her mood swing from hope to desperation to relief to anxiety, her girl's pain playing her like a game of poker. The entry that followed me home, though, simply read: 'Lord hear our cries and have mercy on my son. Please keep him safe in your arms forever.' Then, in the cancer ward, the revelation, as I watched a little girl of six or seven struggle through a door with a mobile drip which was so much bigger than she, then wrestle it grimly down the corridor. She'd lost her hair, presumably as a consequence of chemotherapy, and her face was misshapen, distended, with harrowed eyes wide with determination. You looked at her and your only possible thought was, 'This is not right. It shouldn't be happening,' at which point you either burst into tears or pull your jacket over your head, crouch to the floor and hop around like Basil Fawlty impersonating a frog. Neither, it is fair to assume, would be of much help. The thing is, we expect to be able to protect our children. We lead them to believe that we will, and in the main we do, but their childhood ends the day we no longer can, or will, and so does any echo of our own. In the adult world, joy tends to be anticipated, where horror drops out of the sky. We want the opposite for kids, for horror to be seen in advance and susceptible to control, while joy just happens. And we can't have that. Jean Simmons had told me that one of the most agonising decisions parents face when a child dies is what to dress them in for the funeral. 'They nearly always talk about dressing the child warmly,' she said. 'They're afraid they'll be cold.' And then it struck me that we're only here on loan to our children, and they to us. And that all the horror I've seen and been told about only has force because it corresponds to love. I decided to go home and take the kids to the park and hand this article in late.",

      "body": "<p>It's 10am in the lobby of Ian Schrager's hotel, The Sanderson. While the receptionist is calmly denying all knowledge of the person I'm looking for, an American woman passes by barking into her phone, 'You know who else is here? The woman who plays Carmela Soprano? Edie Falco?'</p> <p>That's Edie Falco's status in life these days: she's TV famous, her face is emblazoned across billboards on Times Square. There are other female parts in The Sopranos, the HBO series that's made her name, that are showier: the terrifying matriarch Livia, played by the late Nancy Marchand, or the psychiatrist Dr Melfi, deftly played by Lorraine Bracco.</p> <p>But Carmela is the heart of the programme. Falco is effortless in the role, utterly real: despairing, loyal, tough, able to hold her own at unexpected moments. The Mafia wife who flirts with the priest, who makes the cannelloni, who seems so ordinary and decent and yet is an expert at stashing the cash when the Feds come calling. The fact that she's not flashy or obvious but you still notice her is what makes her performance special. And so Carmela Soprano, at least, is famous and getting more so by the minute.</p> <p>We meet at breakfast time, but Falco doesn't order any food. She drinks mineral water and smokes. 'I quit for three years,' she says. 'I only started again recently. And I'll quit when I'm back home. It's terrible, it's disgusting and I'm so sorry I started again.'</p> <p>Brooklyn-born, Long Island-raised, Edie Falco can sound like Carmela when she chooses. Sometimes, however, her speech shifts into something more precise, academic even. She doesn't look like Carmela either: the bouffant and talons are nowhere to be seen, and Mrs Soprano would never be caught out of the house without a scrap of make-up on. And, in what is a shocking admission for an Italian-American woman, she announces she can't cook.</p> <p>'I've hard-boiled eggs and even done that incorrectly. Fortunately, on the show they shoot me from the waist up so my hands look like they are doing something, and they've got all this beautiful stuff laid around me that the props people deal with, but I don't know a damn thing about cooking. I kinda like that.' Neither does she have children. 'I arrived on the set with these two kids and at first it was terrifying - like \"How in God's name am I going to pull this off? They seem like contemporaries of mine!\" But something kicks in. It's bigger than me, older than me, a sense of having dependence, of caring for someone younger than you. I found it much easier to fall into than I anticipated. I was pleased to find out it was very natural.' Falco, 36, says the experience has encouraged her to have children - 'especially now that I can afford them. But it's just, well, fitting them into the schedule.'</p> <p>It seems strange that The Sopranos has only been around for a year and half now, even less over here. Its position in the cultural canon already seems secure. And it has changed the way TV works in the US, helping shift the balance from the networks to the cable channels. There are no real arguments about whether it's the best TV show around, at least apart from the people who vote for the Emmy awards, who have just shunned it for the second year running.</p> <p>'We knew more or less what to expect,' Falco says. 'Truth is, people don't realise how expensive and time consuming it is to go along to an evening like that. I figured it would feel a bit more worthwhile if we won more. I suppose that sounds petty. I said to [the producers], \"Next time, can we just not go?\" It's not really a forum where we are welcome or appreciated.'</p> <p>Maybe it would help if you knew what happened last year. At the 1999 Emmys, although The Sopranos did badly, Falco won the best actress in a drama award. But that's not really what she remembers from the evening. Instead, her evening was spoilt when the TV panel convened by Joan Rivers and her daughter, deemed Falco's outfit - designed around a silvery Pamela Dennis halter top with tassels - the sartorial disaster of the evening. And although she knew that it shouldn't matter, it did. 'It felt like the popular girl at junior high had put gum on my back.'</p> <p>Why? 'Because I grew up a tomboy. Here I was, thrust into this world where I feel so out of place. I'm trying to do my best, to show up for these things. The truth is that it goes against my nature. So, I had made a conscious effort, a seemingly uneducated one, to do these things correctly. I had asked for help, and I went to the Pamela Dennis boutique. And she picked out this thing and I'm standing there like a mannequin with this thing on me that feels so outrageously uncomfortable and they all said \"Trust us\". And then I went out there, and these people said I was the worst dressed.' The next time she saw Joan Rivers, Falco spoke to her about it. 'This woman who used to be talented,' she says dismissively. 'She looks like some kind of sci-fi creature now with all the work she has had done.'</p> <p>When she talks about The Sopranos, she's as much a fan as one of the stars. She watches it like anybody else would watch it, helped, she says, by the fact that she's often forgotten the scenes by the time they air. And because she loves the show so much, she has spent a great deal of time trying to justify the violence to herself.</p> <p>'On some level it seems necessary. The point is they show you this guy, his lifestyle, in many dimensions. They are not trying to spoonfeed you in how you should feel about him. He's middle-aged, he's going through stress, panic attacks, taking medication, talking to a therapist. It's kind of lovely because you fall in love with him a little bit, recognise things about him. Then he turns around and kills a guy. And you're trying to figure out \"How can I feel for a guy who does that?\" And I think one of the reasons the show is so popular is people are left with questions rather than answers, an amalgam of feelings. And I think it's important that you show both sides of what this guy is like. And to allude to them is one thing, but to actually show them in all their darkness is probably necessary.'</p> <p>There's no great geographical spread to Falco's life: she grew up in Long Island, went to the State University of New York (SUNY) at Purchase and then moved to New York City. Home for Falco is her dog and boyfriend, John Devlin, a commercials director who she's dated for four years. She lives in a loft in Manhattan, owns a weekend cabin upstate. She doesn't like to be away from home for long. Two months spent on location in Italy were 'traumatic' she says. Earlier this year, she worked in London starring alongside Jason Priestly in The Side Man in the West End. 'After a couple of weeks, I lost the impulse to go out and explore, it felt as though something was missing. My heart, basically, had been left thousands of miles away. I sort of went inward.'</p> <p>Not surprisingly then, the idea of living in Los Angeles is anathema to her. 'There's something that goes on out there: people disappear. Personalities disappear. It's frightening. There's this look of desperation on so many of the faces. Every January, my actor friends begin the Los Angeles exodus for pilot season. It seems absolutely outrageous to me, because they all come back defeated and depressed. I speak to them over there, their vocal timbre is different, they just sound horrible.'</p> <p>There has always been a cautiousness, a reticence about Falco. She remembers being 'very shy' when she was growing up. Now she finds all the exposure Carmela has given her unsettling. 'By matter of what I do, I have to be put in positions where I am talking to people - representing HBO or the play that I'm doing - but, in fact, I am very shy.'</p> <p>She's happiest in and around New York, where she grew up. Her father, a graphic artist, is from an Italian background. Her mother's ancestry is Swedish, which she thinks explains the blonde hair. They moved out of Brooklyn to suburban Long Island when she was four, divorced when she was 14.</p> <p>For as long as she can remember, she wanted to act. She just didn't think that she was going to do it for a living. 'I always thought I would do it, some place or other, but I always figured I would have a real job, and I would just do acting on the side, because I thought that's how people did it. And then a teacher of mine at high school said, \"Why don't you study acting at college?\" On some level I've just fallen into it.'</p> <p>She studied acting at SUNY, where her contemporaries included Wesley Snipes, Posey Parker, Stanley Tucci and directors Hal Hartley, Nick Gomez and Eric Mendelsohn. She saw from the start that there was no point in trying to compete for the glamorous roles. 'I got all the weirdo parts: the blacked-out teeth, the fat suits, the old ladies. I always seemed older than I was.'</p> <p>The college connection helped out after she moved to New York in the late 80s; she got parts in films by Hartley (The Unbelievable Truth, Trust ) and Gomez (Laws of Gravity). But that wasn't enough to earn a living. So she took any job going. 'I worked for an entertainment organisation that takes a crew of people to weddings and stuff. I had to dress up as Betsy Ross once, sit on the centrepiece of a table while people ate their dinner. Guys got drunk and started looking under my skirt, it was a fucking nightmare. Other times, we had to dress up in outfits and pull people on to the dancefloor. At weddings, I'm the one in the chair praying that no one comes near me. And there I was, having to put on Cookie Monster with this giant head. The snotty little kid who ran the organisation, said, \"You gotta get out there, you gotta pull people on the dancefloor. Call yourself an actress?\"'</p> <p>She also trained as a graphic artist and a legal proof-reader. Mostly, though, she was a waitress. 'I could do a lot of tables, very quickly. I had a good short-term memory, but I was not very pleasant. Especially towards the end I was horrible, I was so unhappy. When I finally did leave, I had become so unpleasant and I started to feel the guilt; these people just came here for dinner and they don't need my 15 years of resentment as I throw their drink at them. I would watch some of the other waitresses being funny and flirty and think, there's not a chance in hell that I would do that. I'm just doing my job and I'm going home. I left to do a movie, but I knew I wasn't going to waitress any more. I think they are still holding my shifts for me at that restaurant.'</p> <p>She did off-Broadway plays, indie films and some episodes of the quality cop dramas Law &amp; Order and Homicide: Life on the Streets. The kind of stuff an actor does when they're trying to stick to their principles about decent scripts. And the things an actor is limited to when they stay well away from LA. Then in 1997, Tom Fontana, the genius behind Homicide, had a new show starting on the HBO cable network. Oz is a prison drama of both unrelenting brutality ('I don't watch Oz,' Falco admits. 'It's too difficult') and considerable artistic flamboyance, largely unknown in this country because Channel 4 transmits it at 1.40am. Fontana remembered Falco from her stint on Homicide and gave her a substantial role as a prison guard. It was a good move.</p> <p>A year or so later, they were casting for The Sopranos, another drama which takes advantage of the freedom from censorship and sponsor pressure that HBO's cable status brings. And Falco got the part of the gangster's wife. In almost every way, The Sopranos is of a fit with all the other well-written, carefully crafted, upmarket East Coast work she had done before. Her old friend Nick Gomez even directed an episode. She was, however, a little wary of her co-star. 'Jim Gandolfini has been cast as the bad guy so many times, so when he was cast as the husband I thought, \"Oh God, you have to have people feel for this guy.\" But the second I got on the set I realised he's fallen in to the same trap we all have: you get cast a certain way and if you want to get work you take those parts. He's one of the most charming, lovable, sensitive, perceptive, vulnerable guys I've met: he just hasn't had a chance to show that side of himself, and here he has. He's working a fine line, and doing it perfectly.'</p> <p>There was only one real difference between The Sopranos and everything else Falco had done: it became a massive hit. 'Television. Huge. I had no idea,' she says. 'A billboard, the size of this room, in Times Square with my face on it. Very weird, very, very weird.' And that changed everything else she was doing: people paid attention to The Side Man, a play she's been in for four years now, in various cities, because she was in it. And they paid attention to Judy Berlin, out here in November, which is otherwise typical of the kind of largely excellent, small indie movies she used to do before. She plays the title role, written for her by college friend Eric Mendelsohn: Judy is an ever optimistic actress planning to head out to the Coast, but working as a colonial milkmaid in a historical theme park. Judy seems much younger than Carmela, but Falco is quick to point out that it's not the age of the characters that makes them seem different, it is the life experience. Some US critics argued that the film is a more acute portrait of suburban life than American Beauty . The New York Times called her performance 'luminous'.</p> <p>Other things have changed, too. In the old days, Falco was reluctant to take cabs. She could not afford them, but she also liked the subway, liked watching people. Now, it's different. 'I'm recognised. I no longer have the luxury of watching people behave as they behave, because they are watching me. I loved my anonymous life in New York. There are so many people doing so many things and I could just wander around and watch and do whatever it is that one does. I don't have that luxury any more. All of a sudden to leave the house means having to talk to all kinds of people you don't know.'</p> <p>Edie Falco has only been in one proper Hollywood movie, Random Hearts. It stars Harrison Ford. I've never seen it, I confess. 'Me neither,' she says. Then she smiles, and gets excited. 'It was fun. It was really fun. It was two days and I felt like a little kid again.' Right now, for the only time in the interview, she sounds girlish. 'I almost passed out at the size of Harrison Ford's trailer.'</p> <p>Whether she accepts it or not, Edie Falco lives in the A-list world now. It's a matter of record, for instance, that this year she wore a purple Donna Karan dress to the Emmys. Because people love Carmela, they'll want to know about the woman who plays her. That's just the way it works. When I talked to her again last week, she was worrying about the looming actor's strike. I asked whether she was voting for industrial action. 'I suppose I should, yeah, because these are important things that we are fighting for. But it's also an odd position I'm in, because I am working and I'd much rather continue working, but I do have to think of the long term and my many friends who are struggling, so it's a rough call.'</p> <p>It's as if she can't quite believe her luck, that if she lets go now it will all disappear. It's not likely. Edie Falco may be an accidental star in some ways, but no one doubts she has the talent to make it last. And a toughness, an insistence on doing things on her own terms. Most of all, she's got a rare perspective on the insanity of the acting profession. 'It is almost humorous that of all the actresses I know, I would end up in this position. Because they all seemed like they wanted it so much more.'</p> <p><b>Life after the Godfather</b></p> <p>Just think about the title: The Sopranos - an intriguingly feminine choice of surname for the stars of a programme about a dysfunctional (is there any other kind?) Mafia family, but then the Sopranos are far more in touch with their feminine side than any of their screen predecessors. Uniquely, in the gangster oeuvre, the women are not portrayed merely as arm candy or two-dimensional victims - sometimes they even get the best lines.</p> <p>The drama is fuelled by the patriarchal mobster and occasional waste-management consultant Tony Soprano's (James Gandolfini) existential crises; the creeping, disillusioning sense that his very particular New Jersey Italian-American dream is imploding.</p> <p>In the pilot episode, Tony visits a beautiful female shrink, Dr Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco, who played Henry Hill's wife in GoodFellas), and declares sorrowfully, 'I came in at the end. The best is over.' 'Many Americans feel like that, I think,' she replies, but for Tony this is less a nostalgic lament for the state of America than it is for the demise of 'this thing of ours' - the perceived golden age of the Mafia crime family that he can now only enjoy via DVD home screenings of his favourite movie, The Godfather, invoked as if it were a documentary.</p> <p>'Most mob dramas are period pieces. Even if they're set in the present day, they feel like they belong to a different era,' says Sopranos creator-writer-producer-director David Chase. 'But the biggest threat to the Mafia is not the FBI or the police; it's the decline in morals, the fact that the next generation doesn't understand their heritage.' It is this sense that omert\u00e0 aint what it used to be that so haunts Tony, providing the show with both its finest comedy moments and its darkest, most unflinching drama.</p> <p>All Tony's relationships, particularly with the women in his life, are fraught. A love-hate tussle with his mother, Livia, the Borgia from the 'burbs (the extraordinary Nancy Marchand who, though she sadly died last June, will appear in the second series); his shrink Jennifer, whom he perceives as part-fantasy woman, part-ballbreaker; his Ivy League daughter Meadow, and his wife Carmela.

      "bodyText": "It's 10am in the lobby of Ian Schrager's hotel, The Sanderson. While the receptionist is calmly denying all knowledge of the person I'm looking for, an American woman passes by barking into her phone, 'You know who else is here? The woman who plays Carmela Soprano? Edie Falco?' That's Edie Falco's status in life these days: she's TV famous, her face is emblazoned across billboards on Times Square. There are other female parts in The Sopranos, the HBO series that's made her name, that are showier: the terrifying matriarch Livia, played by the late Nancy Marchand, or the psychiatrist Dr Melfi, deftly played by Lorraine Bracco. But Carmela is the heart of the programme. Falco is effortless in the role, utterly real: despairing, loyal, tough, able to hold her own at unexpected moments. The Mafia wife who flirts with the priest, who makes the cannelloni, who seems so ordinary and decent and yet is an expert at stashing the cash when the Feds come calling. The fact that she's not flashy or obvious but you still notice her is what makes her performance special. And so Carmela Soprano, at least, is famous and getting more so by the minute. We meet at breakfast time, but Falco doesn't order any food. She drinks mineral water and smokes. 'I quit for three years,' she says. 'I only started again recently. And I'll quit when I'm back home. It's terrible, it's disgusting and I'm so sorry I started again.' Brooklyn-born, Long Island-raised, Edie Falco can sound like Carmela when she chooses. Sometimes, however, her speech shifts into something more precise, academic even. She doesn't look like Carmela either: the bouffant and talons are nowhere to be seen, and Mrs Soprano would never be caught out of the house without a scrap of make-up on. And, in what is a shocking admission for an Italian-American woman, she announces she can't cook. 'I've hard-boiled eggs and even done that incorrectly. Fortunately, on the show they shoot me from the waist up so my hands look like they are doing something, and they've got all this beautiful stuff laid around me that the props people deal with, but I don't know a damn thing about cooking. I kinda like that.' Neither does she have children. 'I arrived on the set with these two kids and at first it was terrifying - like \"How in God's name am I going to pull this off? They seem like contemporaries of mine!\" But something kicks in. It's bigger than me, older than me, a sense of having dependence, of caring for someone younger than you. I found it much easier to fall into than I anticipated. I was pleased to find out it was very natural.' Falco, 36, says the experience has encouraged her to have children - 'especially now that I can afford them. But it's just, well, fitting them into the schedule.' It seems strange that The Sopranos has only been around for a year and half now, even less over here. Its position in the cultural canon already seems secure. And it has changed the way TV works in the US, helping shift the balance from the networks to the cable channels. There are no real arguments about whether it's the best TV show around, at least apart from the people who vote for the Emmy awards, who have just shunned it for the second year running. 'We knew more or less what to expect,' Falco says. 'Truth is, people don't realise how expensive and time consuming it is to go along to an evening like that. I figured it would feel a bit more worthwhile if we won more. I suppose that sounds petty. I said to [the producers], \"Next time, can we just not go?\" It's not really a forum where we are welcome or appreciated.' Maybe it would help if you knew what happened last year. At the 1999 Emmys, although The Sopranos did badly, Falco won the best actress in a drama award. But that's not really what she remembers from the evening. Instead, her evening was spoilt when the TV panel convened by Joan Rivers and her daughter, deemed Falco's outfit - designed around a silvery Pamela Dennis halter top with tassels - the sartorial disaster of the evening. And although she knew that it shouldn't matter, it did. 'It felt like the popular girl at junior high had put gum on my back.' Why? 'Because I grew up a tomboy. Here I was, thrust into this world where I feel so out of place. I'm trying to do my best, to show up for these things. The truth is that it goes against my nature. So, I had made a conscious effort, a seemingly uneducated one, to do these things correctly. I had asked for help, and I went to the Pamela Dennis boutique. And she picked out this thing and I'm standing there like a mannequin with this thing on me that feels so outrageously uncomfortable and they all said \"Trust us\". And then I went out there, and these people said I was the worst dressed.' The next time she saw Joan Rivers, Falco spoke to her about it. 'This woman who used to be talented,' she says dismissively. 'She looks like some kind of sci-fi creature now with all the work she has had done.' When she talks about The Sopranos, she's as much a fan as one of the stars. She watches it like anybody else would watch it, helped, she says, by the fact that she's often forgotten the scenes by the time they air. And because she loves the show so much, she has spent a great deal of time trying to justify the violence to herself. 'On some level it seems necessary. The point is they show you this guy, his lifestyle, in many dimensions. They are not trying to spoonfeed you in how you should feel about him. He's middle-aged, he's going through stress, panic attacks, taking medication, talking to a therapist. It's kind of lovely because you fall in love with him a little bit, recognise things about him. Then he turns around and kills a guy. And you're trying to figure out \"How can I feel for a guy who does that?\" And I think one of the reasons the show is so popular is people are left with questions rather than answers, an amalgam of feelings. And I think it's important that you show both sides of what this guy is like. And to allude to them is one thing, but to actually show them in all their darkness is probably necessary.' There's no great geographical spread to Falco's life: she grew up in Long Island, went to the State University of New York (SUNY) at Purchase and then moved to New York City. Home for Falco is her dog and boyfriend, John Devlin, a commercials director who she's dated for four years. She lives in a loft in Manhattan, owns a weekend cabin upstate. She doesn't like to be away from home for long. Two months spent on location in Italy were 'traumatic' she says. Earlier this year, she worked in London starring alongside Jason Priestly in The Side Man in the West End. 'After a couple of weeks, I lost the impulse to go out and explore, it felt as though something was missing. My heart, basically, had been left thousands of miles away. I sort of went inward.' Not surprisingly then, the idea of living in Los Angeles is anathema to her. 'There's something that goes on out there: people disappear. Personalities disappear. It's frightening. There's this look of desperation on so many of the faces. Every January, my actor friends begin the Los Angeles exodus for pilot season. It seems absolutely outrageous to me, because they all come back defeated and depressed. I speak to them over there, their vocal timbre is different, they just sound horrible.' There has always been a cautiousness, a reticence about Falco. She remembers being 'very shy' when she was growing up. Now she finds all the exposure Carmela has given her unsettling. 'By matter of what I do, I have to be put in positions where I am talking to people - representing HBO or the play that I'm doing - but, in fact, I am very shy.' She's happiest in and around New York, where she grew up. Her father, a graphic artist, is from an Italian background. Her mother's ancestry is Swedish, which she thinks explains the blonde hair. They moved out of Brooklyn to suburban Long Island when she was four, divorced when she was 14. For as long as she can remember, she wanted to act. She just didn't think that she was going to do it for a living. 'I always thought I would do it, some place or other, but I always figured I would have a real job, and I would just do acting on the side, because I thought that's how people did it. And then a teacher of mine at high school said, \"Why don't you study acting at college?\" On some level I've just fallen into it.' She studied acting at SUNY, where her contemporaries included Wesley Snipes, Posey Parker, Stanley Tucci and directors Hal Hartley, Nick Gomez and Eric Mendelsohn. She saw from the start that there was no point in trying to compete for the glamorous roles. 'I got all the weirdo parts: the blacked-out teeth, the fat suits, the old ladies. I always seemed older than I was.' The college connection helped out after she moved to New York in the late 80s; she got parts in films by Hartley (The Unbelievable Truth, Trust ) and Gomez (Laws of Gravity). But that wasn't enough to earn a living. So she took any job going. 'I worked for an entertainment organisation that takes a crew of people to weddings and stuff. I had to dress up as Betsy Ross once, sit on the centrepiece of a table while people ate their dinner. Guys got drunk and started looking under my skirt, it was a fucking nightmare. Other times, we had to dress up in outfits and pull people on to the dancefloor. At weddings, I'm the one in the chair praying that no one comes near me. And there I was, having to put on Cookie Monster with this giant head. The snotty little kid who ran the organisation, said, \"You gotta get out there, you gotta pull people on the dancefloor. Call yourself an actress?\"' She also trained as a graphic artist and a legal proof-reader. Mostly, though, she was a waitress. 'I could do a lot of tables, very quickly. I had a good short-term memory, but I was not very pleasant. Especially towards the end I was horrible, I was so unhappy. When I finally did leave, I had become so unpleasant and I started to feel the guilt; these people just came here for dinner and they don't need my 15 years of resentment as I throw their drink at them. I would watch some of the other waitresses being funny and flirty and think, there's not a chance in hell that I would do that. I'm just doing my job and I'm going home. I left to do a movie, but I knew I wasn't going to waitress any more. I think they are still holding my shifts for me at that restaurant.' She did off-Broadway plays, indie films and some episodes of the quality cop dramas Law &amp; Order and Homicide: Life on the Streets. The kind of stuff an actor does when they're trying to stick to their principles about decent scripts. And the things an actor is limited to when they stay well away from LA. Then in 1997, Tom Fontana, the genius behind Homicide, had a new show starting on the HBO cable network. Oz is a prison drama of both unrelenting brutality ('I don't watch Oz,' Falco admits. 'It's too difficult') and considerable artistic flamboyance, largely unknown in this country because Channel 4 transmits it at 1.40am. Fontana remembered Falco from her stint on Homicide and gave her a substantial role as a prison guard. It was a good move. A year or so later, they were casting for The Sopranos, another drama which takes advantage of the freedom from censorship and sponsor pressure that HBO's cable status brings. And Falco got the part of the gangster's wife. In almost every way, The Sopranos is of a fit with all the other well-written, carefully crafted, upmarket East Coast work she had done before. Her old friend Nick Gomez even directed an episode. She was, however, a little wary of her co-star. 'Jim Gandolfini has been cast as the bad guy so many times, so when he was cast as the husband I thought, \"Oh God, you have to have people feel for this guy.\" But the second I got on the set I realised he's fallen in to the same trap we all have: you get cast a certain way and if you want to get work you take those parts. He's one of the most charming, lovable, sensitive, perceptive, vulnerable guys I've met: he just hasn't had a chance to show that side of himself, and here he has. He's working a fine line, and doing it perfectly.' There was only one real difference between The Sopranos and everything else Falco had done: it became a massive hit. 'Television. Huge. I had no idea,' she says. 'A billboard, the size of this room, in Times Square with my face on it. Very weird, very, very weird.' And that changed everything else she was doing: people paid attention to The Side Man, a play she's been in for four years now, in various cities, because she was in it. And they paid attention to Judy Berlin, out here in November, which is otherwise typical of the kind of largely excellent, small indie movies she used to do before. She plays the title role, written for her by college friend Eric Mendelsohn: Judy is an ever optimistic actress planning to head out to the Coast, but working as a colonial milkmaid in a historical theme park. Judy seems much younger than Carmela, but Falco is quick to point out that it's not the age of the characters that makes them seem different, it is the life experience. Some US critics argued that the film is a more acute portrait of suburban life than American Beauty . The New York Times called her performance 'luminous'. Other things have changed, too. In the old days, Falco was reluctant to take cabs. She could not afford them, but she also liked the subway, liked watching people. Now, it's different. 'I'm recognised. I no longer have the luxury of watching people behave as they behave, because they are watching me. I loved my anonymous life in New York. There are so many people doing so many things and I could just wander around and watch and do whatever it is that one does. I don't have that luxury any more. All of a sudden to leave the house means having to talk to all kinds of people you don't know.' Edie Falco has only been in one proper Hollywood movie, Random Hearts. It stars Harrison Ford. I've never seen it, I confess. 'Me neither,' she says. Then she smiles, and gets excited. 'It was fun. It was really fun. It was two days and I felt like a little kid again.' Right now, for the only time in the interview, she sounds girlish. 'I almost passed out at the size of Harrison Ford's trailer.' Whether she accepts it or not, Edie Falco lives in the A-list world now. It's a matter of record, for instance, that this year she wore a purple Donna Karan dress to the Emmys. Because people love Carmela, they'll want to know about the woman who plays her. That's just the way it works. When I talked to her again last week, she was worrying about the looming actor's strike. I asked whether she was voting for industrial action. 'I suppose I should, yeah, because these are important things that we are fighting for. But it's also an odd position I'm in, because I am working and I'd much rather continue working, but I do have to think of the long term and my many friends who are struggling, so it's a rough call.' It's as if she can't quite believe her luck, that if she lets go now it will all disappear. It's not likely. Edie Falco may be an accidental star in some ways, but no one doubts she has the talent to make it last. And a toughness, an insistence on doing things on her own terms. Most of all, she's got a rare perspective on the insanity of the acting profession. 'It is almost humorous that of all the actresses I know, I would end up in this position. Because they all seemed like they wanted it so much more.' Life after the Godfather Just think about the title: The Sopranos - an intriguingly feminine choice of surname for the stars of a programme about a dysfunctional (is there any other kind?) Mafia family, but then the Sopranos are far more in touch with their feminine side than any of their screen predecessors. Uniquely, in the gangster oeuvre, the women are not portrayed merely as arm candy or two-dimensional victims - sometimes they even get the best lines. The drama is fuelled by the patriarchal mobster and occasional waste-management consultant Tony Soprano's (James Gandolfini) existential crises; the creeping, disillusioning sense that his very particular New Jersey Italian-American dream is imploding. In the pilot episode, Tony visits a beautiful female shrink, Dr Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco, who played Henry Hill's wife in GoodFellas), and declares sorrowfully, 'I came in at the end. The best is over.' 'Many Americans feel like that, I think,' she replies, but for Tony this is less a nostalgic lament for the state of America than it is for the demise of 'this thing of ours' - the perceived golden age of the Mafia crime family that he can now only enjoy via DVD home screenings of his favourite movie, The Godfather, invoked as if it were a documentary. 'Most mob dramas are period pieces. Even if they're set in the present day, they feel like they belong to a different era,' says Sopranos creator-writer-producer-director David Chase. 'But the biggest threat to the Mafia is not the FBI or the police; it's the decline in morals, the fact that the next generation doesn't understand their heritage.' It is this sense that omert\u00e0 aint what it used to be that so haunts Tony, providing the show with both its finest comedy moments and its darkest, most unflinching drama. All Tony's relationships, particularly with the women in his life, are fraught. A love-hate tussle with his mother, Livia, the Borgia from the 'burbs (the extraordinary Nancy Marchand who, though she sadly died last June, will appear in the second series); his shrink Jennifer, whom he perceives as part-fantasy woman, part-ballbreaker; his Ivy League daughter Meadow, and his wife Carmela. It would be very easy for Carmela to be written (and played) as a predictably two-dimensional Noo Joisy stereotype wife, all jangling nerves and jewellery, but Falco is more than this. Torn between turning a blind eye to the family business in a bid to raise her children successfully (it might even work: young Anthony Jr sure doesn't look like a made man in the making) and her need to know enough to understand; confused by the fact that her devout Catholicism results in a crush on her priest (confession sometimes takes place, dangerously cosily, on the family sofa with a large glass of wine), Carmela is that rare beast - the modern, multi-faceted mafioso's consort. As drama, The Sopranos' great skill is to evoke our empathy: Tony may be a violent mobster, but he's no shark-eyed, sharkskin-suited Michael Corleone. Instead, he's a murderer who has panic attacks, a paunch, a troubled soul and a difficult marriage; struggling to understand precisely where, in an increasingly confused and confusing world, he fits in. And who can't relate to that? Family matters From mobsters to shrinks... The Sopranos hits the high notes. Kate Kray, Ronnie Kray's widow: It gets inside the mind of the boss gangster. It's much better than Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels because it makes a farce of violence. The Sopranos might be a comedy, but it doesn't make out that the violence is funny. Like the women in The Sopranos , you've got to be strong-willed because one minute these men are up and the next they're down. You've got to be a good listener, but pretend you don't know anything. I know a lot of gangsters who watch it. As far as I know it's quite accurate for America, but I can't see a gangster this side of the water going to a psychiatrist. Professor Anthony Clare, psychiatrist: The Sopranos casts an interesting light on the perennial issue of whether it is weakness or strength to go to a psychiatrist. In Tony Soprano, it's taken a stereotype of the Mafia mobster, and of masculinity, and put him in a stiuation where he's involved in an activity quite at odds with that. Therapy is focused on talking rather than doing, it's uncertain and ambiguous compared with the ruthless certainty with which he conducts the rest of his life. The reaction of the Mafia guys to Tony's therapy says a lot about our anxieties. Frankie Fraser, former East End gangster: It could never compare to real life, but it tries its hardest to come up to it and in some respects it's not too far behind. The domestic situation is not quite right, though. They seem to feature women a lot and that wouldn't be as it really is. Their opinions are treasured, but obviously, in real life, women take a back seat. If any of my associates had gone into therapy he would have been kicked out because he'd be a danger. If he's that unstable that he's got to see a therapist, you can't rely on him.

In the end, we did the shoot and I felt strangely awkward and clumsy next to him - he seemed so feminine.' \u0095 Real Women runs from 27 September to 30 October at AKA Bar and Restaurant, 18 West Central Street, London WC1 (020 7836 0110). Open Monday to Saturday, 6pm to 3am",

      "body": "<p>Homeowners face a tenfold increase in the risk of flooding and other weather- related damage to their property, the Environment Agency is warning. </p> <p>The Government body launched a new flood warning system last week with the prediction that Britain could become a flood 'hot spot', with 5 million people already living in flood risk areas. The agency says changing UK climate patterns will result in a 10 per cent increase in annual rainfall, wetter winters and more summer storms - all of which could cause flooding. </p> <p>Chairman Sir John Harman said: 'Flood risk is now a fact of daily life. Reports of flooding are now on average nearly twice as frequent as they were 100 years ago. More worryingly, with climate change, we could see up to a tenfold increase inrisk over the next century.' </p> <p>Even if your home has never previously been affected, there is no guarantee that you will remain safe. Last year, only one in eight people whose homes were flooded had experienced anything like it before. The agency fears that Government plans to build 23 million new homes in the next 15 years could exacerbate the problem. It is working with the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions to introduce tougher guidance for plan ning authorities to curb development in flood plains. </p> <p>Properties with 'river frontage', 'lake' or 'sea views' are in great demand, yet they are particularly at risk. </p> <p>Harman warns: 'Flood risk will not automatically be included in the property search when you are buying a new home. You must request it from your solicitor or do your own homework.' </p> <p>You can ring the agency's new Floodline on 0845 988 1188, or request a personal call-back by clicking the 'phone-me' option on its website, <a href=\"http://www.environmentagency.gov.uk\">www.environmentagency.gov.uk</a> to find out if your home is at risk. It also offers practical hints on how to minimise the financial and emotional impact of a flood. </p> <p>Portsmouth residents had first-hand experience of the new warning system last week. Torrential downpours and the breakdown of a local pumping station sent a tide of raw sewage pouring through 115 homes. The damage will take months, if not years, to repair fully. </p> <p>So what can you do to protect yourself and your property? The first step is to make sure you have adequate home and contents insurance.

      "bodyText": "Homeowners face a tenfold increase in the risk of flooding and other weather- related damage to their property, the Environment Agency is warning. The Government body launched a new flood warning system last week with the prediction that Britain could become a flood 'hot spot', with 5 million people already living in flood risk areas. The agency says changing UK climate patterns will result in a 10 per cent increase in annual rainfall, wetter winters and more summer storms - all of which could cause flooding. Chairman Sir John Harman said: 'Flood risk is now a fact of daily life. Reports of flooding are now on average nearly twice as frequent as they were 100 years ago. More worryingly, with climate change, we could see up to a tenfold increase inrisk over the next century.' Even if your home has never previously been affected, there is no guarantee that you will remain safe. Last year, only one in eight people whose homes were flooded had experienced anything like it before. The agency fears that Government plans to build 23 million new homes in the next 15 years could exacerbate the problem. It is working with the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions to introduce tougher guidance for plan ning authorities to curb development in flood plains. Properties with 'river frontage', 'lake' or 'sea views' are in great demand, yet they are particularly at risk. Harman warns: 'Flood risk will not automatically be included in the property search when you are buying a new home. You must request it from your solicitor or do your own homework.' You can ring the agency's new Floodline on 0845 988 1188, or request a personal call-back by clicking the 'phone-me' option on its website, www.environmentagency.gov.uk to find out if your home is at risk. It also offers practical hints on how to minimise the financial and emotional impact of a flood. Portsmouth residents had first-hand experience of the new warning system last week. Torrential downpours and the breakdown of a local pumping station sent a tide of raw sewage pouring through 115 homes. The damage will take months, if not years, to repair fully. So what can you do to protect yourself and your property? The first step is to make sure you have adequate home and contents insurance. The Association of British Insurers says nearly 40 per cent of UK homes have no buildings insurance, and 25 per cent of homes at risk of flooding have no contents cover. Paul Charles of online broker Screentrade says even those who have cover may find they are under-insured: 'Flooding is classed as a \"standard peril\", and all buildings and contents poli cies include it, but you don't want to guess that your contents are worth \u00a320,000 when they are actually worth \u00a340,000.' The average claim for flood damage is \u00a36,000 to \u00a37,000. If your home has been flooded before, you may find your insurance premiums are raised, but don't be tempted to mislead the insurance company. Charles says: 'Insurers check the information you give them with your previous insurer, and they will discover if you try to conceal a previous claim. If you are found out, your policy could become null and void.' It is a good idea to make a record of the damage done to your home as soon as possible. Make a video or take photographs while the water is still inside, if possible. Some policies provide immediate assistance for flood victims. However to ensure that you can contact your insurer quickly, Charles recommends keeping your policy documents (and all other important documents, passports and valuables) on the first floor or higher. Many victims say the worst aspects of flooding come during the recovery period. After the flood, it's vital to clean the property as soon as possible to minimise problems caused by damp. The longer a home spends under water, the greater the damage to its fabric. 'The dog barked, then we were walking in water' John and Jeanette Taylor have been flooded twice in the past two weeks. Although they live on the Ridge - which is high up, as its name suggests - in Hastings, they suffered from overflowing drains two Fridays running. 'The first time we were asleep in bed, and the dog woke us up by barking. My wife got out of bed and found she was walking in water,' says John. The second time, after it had rained heavily for 10 minutes, water started coming in under the door. 'There was very little warning,' John says. On both occasions, sudden thunderstorms sent water flooding through their roof and overwhelmed both their mains drainage - only 4in in diameter - and the sewerage system, which are just outside the couple's front door. Luckily the house has an upside-down design, with the bedrooms on the ground floor and the living room and kitchen on the first floor. This meant that their documents and valuables were safe on the first floor. However, the flooding has ruined the Taylors' downstairs carpet, their wiring and the decoration in their bathroom. Eagle Star, their contents insurer, has arranged for a company to start work on drying out the house. Although the couple have not yet received estimates of how much the repair work will cost, John expects a replacement carpet alone to cost about \u00a3500. He also believes work will be needed to widen the drainage system to prevent future flooding. How to stay safe You can't prevent flooding, but you can be ready.

Keep it upstairs if possible. \u0095 Buy a few sandbags or floor boards to block doors and airbricks, but ensure there is still adequate ventilation. \u0095 Get into the habit of storing valuables upstairs. When you hear a flood warning: \u0095 Move people, pets and valuables upstairs or to higher ground. \u0095 Drive your car to higher ground. It would take only 2ft of fast-flowing water to wash it away. \u0095 Check on your neighbours - do they need help? \u0095 Keep warm and dry.

Cover costs from \u00a323 for 31 days to \u00a3215 for a full gap year, and provides medical expenses cover of \u00a32m, personal liability cover of \u00a31m, \u00a310,000 for personal acci dents and \u00a35,000 for death. The policy covers against a wide range of extreme sports, as well as many team games which are excluded from standard policies. Call 020 7739 3444 for further information. Car loan choice E-loan - the online loans introducer - has launched a car finance service helps motorists choose from a range of car loans to get the best deal for buying a new or second-hand car. The service offers car loans from six lenders - AA Financial Services, Alliance &amp; Leicester, Bank of Scotland's Freeway, Finax, Online Finance and Paragon - and provides four different ways to repay: personal loans, hire purchase, contract purchase (covering personal contract purchase and lease purchase) and deferred loans. Interest rates range from 8.9 per cent APR to 19 per cent APR, depending on size and type of loan. The site provides a range of price calculators including one to help company car owners compare tax charges against the alternative extra salary. Insurance soars Further grim news for motorists - they face an average insurance premium increase of 35 per cent this year. A report from consulting actuary Tillinghast-Towers Perrin says that drivers aged 17-24 have had to pay up to 50 per cent more since August 1999, regardless of where they live or their no-claims bonus. And drivers aged between 17 and 20 have seen their premiums soar by more than 60 per cent. Beg, steal and burrow Today is International Rabbit Day, and to mark the occasion pet insurer Pet Plan has published a free guide to owning and caring for rabbits. It shows you how to choose one, how to accommodate it indoors and outdoors, how to feed it, how to train it against chewing and digging, and advises on health and grooming. Bunny lovers (there are at least 1.8 million in the UK) who want a copy of the guide should call 0208 580 8196. Pet Plan is also offering free cover for one month to pet owners who apply online for pet insurance.",

Currently she is making only the minimum monthly repayments on these. In addition, she has an agreed \u00a31,200 bank overdraft and an informal loan of \u00a31,000 from friends. </p> <p>She is wondering whether to consolidate her debts by taking out a personal loan, or to add them to her mortgage - \u00a363,000 with Halifax. It is a fixed-rate loan with a redemption penalty period expiring in 2003. She is repaying it through a mixture of an endowment (\u00a344,000), an Isa (\u00a315,000) and an ordinary repayment loan (\u00a34,000). </p> <p>She says she has enough spare equity in the property to increase her mortgage if necessary and estimates it is now worth around \u00a395,000. </p> <p>She took a sabbatical from her job with a Health Authority when she decided to go to Romania, but has now decided to move on to a new position with a local authority, for which she needs a car. Fortunately her new employer is providing her with a loan for this purpose.

She has two bank accounts, with the Halifax and with First Direct. </p> <p>Her only savings are just less than \u00a3200 in a Tessa, which she opened with First Direct just before the tax-free accounts were abolished in April 1999. Once she has sorted her debts out, she would like to save more for the future.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Sharon Linnard</strong></p> <p>VSO work can be very rewarding but not financially, as Isobel has discovered. She is right in making debt repayment her first priority because, although minimum payments on credit cards seem acceptable, the underlying interest rate is surprisingly high. First Direct's rate is 18.9 per cent a year, with RBS Advanta not far behind at 17.9 per cent. </p> <p>One way of containing this is to make an application to a different provider where for a limited period a much lower rate is charged on debts transferred.

      "body": "<p>There is just a certain something about guitars. More than almost any musical instruments, with the possible exception of saxophones, they are the epitome of cool. At school guys who played the violin or flute were seen as swotty and dull, but if they could bash out a couple of chords on a beaten-up old Fender, that was a different matter. </p> <p>Guitars are also aesthetic objects: their basic curves may be found in violins and cellos, but only 'axes' can pull off cherry sunburst, cardinal red, or even silver sparkle finishes with aplomb, and as a result they've become increasingly desirable. This means that many are great investments, appreciating by 10 to 20 per cent a year - far better returns than you'll find in a building society or Isa. </p> <p>The good news is that you don't have to earn a rock star's wages to afford such an asset. Noel Gallagher of Oasis used his Switch card to buy a guitar for less than \u00a3500 just before he hit the big time and has now, apparently, developed quite an eye for collectables. However, you need to know what to look for because, as in any market, there are duds and fakes. </p> <p>Rick Zsigmond is a partner in London's Vintage Guitar Emporium and has sold instruments to some of the biggest names in the business. His shop's toilet walls are covered in autographs and read like a 'Who's Who' of rock and pop - Holly Johnson, Jon Bon Jovi, Gary Moore, Bryan Adams and Rory Gallagher. Loyd Grossman's name also appears among them; it seems the Masterchef presenter is an avid collector (yes, really). </p> <p>'The first rule about buying a guitar is that you have to love it,' says Zsigmond. 'Go for a sound you like and admire. For instance, if you're a fan of Buddy Holly, or indeed Jimi Hendrix, you might choose a Fender Stratocaster.' Both of these rock legends had their Strats engraved on their headstones. </p> <p>Paul Alcantara, a London-based writer and guitar teacher with around 30 instruments in his collection, echoes this sentiment: 'When you buy a vintage guitar, a little magic comes with it. It should be something that interests you and you shouldn't be afraid to play it. For those of us who grew up in the postwar years, electric guitars have become potent icons of the rock 'n' roll era. That's why products of the mid-Fifties to mid-Sixties are the most sought after.' </p> <p>At the top of the price scale are US manufacturers such as Fender, Gibson, Epiphone, Martin and Rickenbacker. One of these makes from the peak era would be a serious investment, setting you back thousands of pounds. The price rises further with the 'Cor' factor: clean, original and rare. A 1958 Gibson Flying V in natural korina finish was recently on sale for \u00a355,000, and prices can reach \u00a380,000 for a really desirable instrument. </p> <p>But if your means are modest there is still a variety of good guitars around. Alcantara is a fan of the US brand Paul Reed Smith, among others. He bought a 1987 model for \u00a3900 last year. The same model in similar condition would now cost around \u00a31,500. He says: 'It is just a lovely quality guitar, with Brazilian rosewood fretboard, a material not used any more [for ecological reasons].' Other makes he rates are Musicman and Tom Anderson, in electric, and Santa Cruz, Collings and Taylor acoustic guitars. </p> <p>He believes that, unless you're an expert, it is often safer to buy an instrument for \u00a3700 rather than \u00a37,000. 'Who's going to bother to fake it for a few hundred? Higher up the scale, there's a bigger incentive.' </p> <p>His success has come from trying to stay one step ahead, buying instruments that appeal to him as a player and often choosing 'sleepers', makes which have yet to reach their potential on the market. </p> <p>'Guitars produced in the Eighties, such as Jackson, often came with lurid graphic finishes and can be found for a fraction of their original retail price. Who knows? A heavy metal revival and these could become highly desirable.' </p> <p>He has already scored from this approach. 'I bought some Danelectros, made of masonite [hardboard to us] with lipstick tubes for pick-ups, which stopped being produced in 1968. Some cost as little as \u00a3150. I've sold some now and done quite well, but I've also held on to a few.' </p> <p>Zsigmond believes that, if you are just starting out, re-issues of classics such as Fenders and Gibson Les Pauls can be a good buy. He says: 'They may depreciate briefly, but then you can watch the value start to climb back up.' </p> <p>Alcantara, though, strikes a note of caution: 'Some of the limited edition reissues are made in greater quantity than a maker such as Rickenbacker would produce its originals.' </p> <p>Both agree that the best advice is to follow your nose. 'Some people just have a feel for the right guitar,' says Zsigmond. </p> <p>Once you have an idea of what you want, what should you look out for? 'Restoration,' says Zsigmond, 'can render a guitar virtually worthless. If you suspect an instrument has had major repairs or a change to the finish, walk away.' </p> <p>Small repairs or knocks, though, are generally not too serious: they won't affect the value too much and they can give the guitar character. Other repairs, such as changing the frets, are essential - but in some of the older, rarer guitars, this can affect the value. </p> <p>'Then you find owners who are afraid to play their instru ments, which seems a shame,' says Alcantara. </p> <p>The finish can also make a big difference to the price. A good condition 1966 Gibson Firebird in a wood finish, for instance, is now worth around \u00a33,000, says Zsigmond, but in cardinal red it's worth \u00a37,000. </p> <p>Other popular or 'custom' finishes go under such evocative names as candy apple red, seafoam green, shoreline gold, blue sparkle and aqua pearl. However, take care in this area: the premium price asked for a rare colour means they are susceptible to faking. </p> <p>If the collecting bug takes hold, there are several ways of adding to or upgrading your collection without breaking the bank. You could pool resources with like-minded friends, for instance. Zsigmond sells to a group of five City workers, whose primary motive is investment, but who take it in turns to take their jointly owned guitars home to play. </p> <p>As values rise, they upgrade their instruments, often by part-exchanging. This is a route taken by single collectors as well, starting small and building up gradually. </p> <p>Another option is swapping with other enthusiasts. 'People develop different tastes,' says Alcantara. 'Collectors meet and swap regularly.' </p> <p>The most important thing, however, is to enjoy what you collect. You don't have to be Eric Clapton to appreciate the quality of what you've bought, even if all you do is 'noodle' away in your sitting room. </p> <p>As Alcantara says: 'You can play an old guitar, but you can't post an old stamp, can you?'</p> <p><strong>How to ensure your 'axe' keeps its cutting edge </strong></p> <p>Avoid storage where temperatures fluctuate, such as near radiators or heating pipes. For acoustics, it might be worth buying a humidifier. </p> <p>If you move your guitar through different temperatures, leave it in its case for a couple of hours to acclimatise or the finish could crack.</p> <p>When cleaning your guitar, do not use polishes that are:</p> <p>\u0095 paraffin-based; they will dull the finish.</p> <p>\u0095 waxy; they may leave the instrument greasy for weeks.</p> <p>\u0095 made with silicone.</p> <p>Wipe your guitar with a damp cloth and replace the strings regularly.</p>",

He says: 'They may depreciate briefly, but then you can watch the value start to climb back up.' Alcantara, though, strikes a note of caution: 'Some of the limited edition reissues are made in greater quantity than a maker such as Rickenbacker would produce its originals.' Both agree that the best advice is to follow your nose. 'Some people just have a feel for the right guitar,' says Zsigmond. Once you have an idea of what you want, what should you look out for? 'Restoration,' says Zsigmond, 'can render a guitar virtually worthless. If you suspect an instrument has had major repairs or a change to the finish, walk away.' Small repairs or knocks, though, are generally not too serious: they won't affect the value too much and they can give the guitar character. Other repairs, such as changing the frets, are essential - but in some of the older, rarer guitars, this can affect the value. 'Then you find owners who are afraid to play their instru ments, which seems a shame,' says Alcantara. The finish can also make a big difference to the price. A good condition 1966 Gibson Firebird in a wood finish, for instance, is now worth around \u00a33,000, says Zsigmond, but in cardinal red it's worth \u00a37,000. Other popular or 'custom' finishes go under such evocative names as candy apple red, seafoam green, shoreline gold, blue sparkle and aqua pearl. However, take care in this area: the premium price asked for a rare colour means they are susceptible to faking. If the collecting bug takes hold, there are several ways of adding to or upgrading your collection without breaking the bank. You could pool resources with like-minded friends, for instance. Zsigmond sells to a group of five City workers, whose primary motive is investment, but who take it in turns to take their jointly owned guitars home to play. As values rise, they upgrade their instruments, often by part-exchanging. This is a route taken by single collectors as well, starting small and building up gradually. Another option is swapping with other enthusiasts. 'People develop different tastes,' says Alcantara. 'Collectors meet and swap regularly.' The most important thing, however, is to enjoy what you collect. You don't have to be Eric Clapton to appreciate the quality of what you've bought, even if all you do is 'noodle' away in your sitting room. As Alcantara says: 'You can play an old guitar, but you can't post an old stamp, can you?' How to ensure your 'axe' keeps its cutting edge Avoid storage where temperatures fluctuate, such as near radiators or heating pipes. For acoustics, it might be worth buying a humidifier. If you move your guitar through different temperatures, leave it in its case for a couple of hours to acclimatise or the finish could crack. When cleaning your guitar, do not use polishes that are: \u0095 paraffin-based; they will dull the finish. \u0095 waxy; they may leave the instrument greasy for weeks. \u0095 made with silicone. Wipe your guitar with a damp cloth and replace the strings regularly.",

      "body": "<p>Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott will tomorrow launch a renewed crackdown on company directors who neglect health and safety regulations in their businesses. </p> <p>In the first of two speeches to Labour's conference in Brighton this week, Prescott will unveil a package of measures including harsher fines for safety breaches; a clearer definition of directors' responsibilities for health and safety; and measures to 'recycle' proceeds from financial penalties paid by directors and companies into strengthened regulation. An enhanced role for trade union safety representatives will also be included. </p> <p>Officials at the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions are also working with the Home Office to strengthen the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions in securing convictions for health and safety breaches, and are co-operating on Jack Straw's plans for a new charge of corporate manslaughter. </p> <p>Figures in the most recent Health and Safety Executive annual report indicate that fatal injuries at work fell from 274 in 1998 to 257 in 1999, and that there were falls of 5 per cent in major non-fatal accidents and those which kept people away from work for at least three days. </p> <p>However, trade unions have argued that not enough is being done to reduce these levels faster, and have mounted a high-profile campaign spotlighting the continuation of dangerous practices by many firms and the need for clearer and more effective regulations. </p> <p>Prescott believes that directors do not take health and safety issues seriously enough, and that the only way of focusing attention on the issue is to come down hard with a major review of fines and the introduction of new methods of preventing bad practice. </p> <p>The Government does not simply want to raise penalties; it wants to overhaul health and safety regulations. There are also plans to 'fast track' certain offences where there is a feeling that the directors are guilty of gross negligence. </p> <p>A government source said: 'We think the penalties for putting workers' safety at risk are not tough enough. In health and safety law the punishment does not fit the crime Higher fines are a certainty.' </p> <p>The measures will form part of a new Safety Bill which is likely to be put on to the legislative programme early in the next parliament if Labour wins the general election. Sources say the DETR is already pushing for early parliamentary time for such a bill. </p> <p>The Deputy Prime Ministers will also use his speech to announce that he will accept the conclusions of Lord Cullen's report into the Ladbroke Grove rail disaster when they emerge. </p> <p>The anniversary of the tragedy falls at the beginning of next month. Prescott will also outline in his speech a new series of targets aiming to reduce the numbers of deaths and serious injuries in road accidents. </p> <p>'As far as Cullen goes, without wanting to pre-empt anything, there is a full commitment to implementing what he comes up with at the end of his inquiry,' a Whitehall source said. </p> <p>Any of Cullen's recommendations which require primary legislation can go into the Safety Bill.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott will tomorrow launch a renewed crackdown on company directors who neglect health and safety regulations in their businesses. In the first of two speeches to Labour's conference in Brighton this week, Prescott will unveil a package of measures including harsher fines for safety breaches; a clearer definition of directors' responsibilities for health and safety; and measures to 'recycle' proceeds from financial penalties paid by directors and companies into strengthened regulation. An enhanced role for trade union safety representatives will also be included. Officials at the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions are also working with the Home Office to strengthen the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions in securing convictions for health and safety breaches, and are co-operating on Jack Straw's plans for a new charge of corporate manslaughter. Figures in the most recent Health and Safety Executive annual report indicate that fatal injuries at work fell from 274 in 1998 to 257 in 1999, and that there were falls of 5 per cent in major non-fatal accidents and those which kept people away from work for at least three days. However, trade unions have argued that not enough is being done to reduce these levels faster, and have mounted a high-profile campaign spotlighting the continuation of dangerous practices by many firms and the need for clearer and more effective regulations. Prescott believes that directors do not take health and safety issues seriously enough, and that the only way of focusing attention on the issue is to come down hard with a major review of fines and the introduction of new methods of preventing bad practice. The Government does not simply want to raise penalties; it wants to overhaul health and safety regulations. There are also plans to 'fast track' certain offences where there is a feeling that the directors are guilty of gross negligence. A government source said: 'We think the penalties for putting workers' safety at risk are not tough enough. In health and safety law the punishment does not fit the crime Higher fines are a certainty.' The measures will form part of a new Safety Bill which is likely to be put on to the legislative programme early in the next parliament if Labour wins the general election. Sources say the DETR is already pushing for early parliamentary time for such a bill. The Deputy Prime Ministers will also use his speech to announce that he will accept the conclusions of Lord Cullen's report into the Ladbroke Grove rail disaster when they emerge. The anniversary of the tragedy falls at the beginning of next month. Prescott will also outline in his speech a new series of targets aiming to reduce the numbers of deaths and serious injuries in road accidents. 'As far as Cullen goes, without wanting to pre-empt anything, there is a full commitment to implementing what he comes up with at the end of his inquiry,' a Whitehall source said. Any of Cullen's recommendations which require primary legislation can go into the Safety Bill.",

The camera homed in on Jane's fabulous legs. 'Very pretty girl... Could have been a model... Obviously, that was nine years ago...' said Graham with a tiny sigh of resignation before the shot switched to an unforgiving close-up of an impassive Jane now: arms crossed, eyes tired, not looking much like a model and subjecting herself to the apparently passive and ineffectual ministrations of the family mediation service as she and Graham negotiated the terms of their divorce. </p> <p>If one was being kind, one could say that Graham, anti-hero of <strong> Break Up</strong>, was in the throes of a classic midlife crisis, even though there was an enormous amount of evidence to suggest that he hadn't grown up enough to justify one. Blandly good-looking and tautly muscled, Graham was an aerobics instructor but Jane (rather naively by her own admission) hadn't really thought too much about the fact that her husband spent his working days urging a roomful of Lycra-clad young women to go for the burn, or whatever it is that happens at aerobics classes. For a while she even believed that Graham's new girlfriend had been acquired after their split, though it had only been a few weeks since he'd fled the marital home. Then she found the notes - 'Thank you for the personal services. Love, Me' - hidden in the garage. </p> <p>Graham, patently a bit of a body fascist, was obviously fairly disappointed by the fact that Jane, the mother of his three children, wasn't quite the looker she had been. He had consoled himself, however, by running up close to \u00a320,000 of debt and now, on top of all this, had suddenly acquired a new house. Not a one-bedroom flat, mind, but a whole house, costing more than the family home. </p> <p>As he moved in, he gave us a tour, while his mum vacuumed in the background. 'Do you expect me to live on the street?!' Graham had demanded of Jane. Compromise was clearly not on his agenda, but the maths didn't add up: a reluctantly revealed monthly income of \u00a31,600 wasn't enough to support his wife, three small children, two mortgages and all that debt which, as the mediators pointed out, amounted to \u00a33,400 a month. While Graham insisted that the State pick up the tab for Jane and their kids ('I've paid taxes!'), his wife's restraint was saintly. I wanted to punch his lights out. </p> <p>Wednesday night was good for 'there but for the grace of...' documentaries. At the same time as Jane and Graham were tussling with the horrible banality of their divorce, on BBC2 in <strong> Sperm Wars</strong>, a cocktail waitress called, confusingly, Pamela Reno, from Reno, Nevada, was trying to persuade us that it was perfectly acceptable to harvest the sperm of her dead 19-year-old son, Jeremy (Russian roulette at a party, if you're interested), acquire an egg donor (ideally one of Jeremy's ex-girlfriends, so she could show the putative offspring pictures of 'mommy and daddy together') and a surrogate mother, and create herself a lovely little 'souvenir' grandchild, or preferably two ('I'd like twins!'). </p> <p>This modern gothic horror story was, however, counterbalanced by the slightly less ethically clear-cut tale of the Vernoffs, whose son Bruce had died of an (apparently accidental, though this was a bit vague) overdose after a car crash, and whose wife, Gaby, had been planning to start a family shortly before he died. Here there was at least a loving, close-knit family for the (very much alive and now cutely toddling) result of Bruce's posthumous sperm harvest, but once you start relieving even a happily married - albeit undeniably dead - man of his sperm, where does it end? </p> <p>In the cases of Graham and Pamela it is so very easy easy to judge. They invariably set themselves up and the selective directing and the editing merely helped us despise them, even though one recognises that the 'truth' we are presented with can never be the whole truth. It was also very easy to judge the participants in the week's other big curtain-twitching documentary - the first in the series <strong> Love Is Not Enough</strong>, which follows a handful of British couples through the harrowing year-long process of attempting to adopt a child. </p> <p>Caught up in this particularly sneaky parlour game, I found myself thinking that moneyed and middle-class Mark and Sarah (looking for a Chinese baby and with one Romanian adoption already under their belts) really ought to clear away those three empty morning-after-the-night-before wine bottles from the kitchen table at which little Josh was eating his Rice Krispies while they all waited for the social worker to arrive. And if Linda and Tony seriously thought they could persuade their social worker that the cluttered and claustrophobic spare-room-cum-cupboard in the eaves was really suitable for a new child, then they probably ought to be employed doing makeovers on Changing Rooms . </p> <p>And surely Paula and Al could see that talking about hearing 'voices from God' and belonging to a happy-clappy charismatic church called The Frontline made them appear, in these godless times, more like weird cultists than staunch upholders of Christian values. Nope, on the evidence of the first episode in this series I don't think I'd let any of this lot take on even one of the 7,000 children a year who need adopting - but that was surely the point of the exercise: from the viewer's sofa, this was only a gameshow. Ooh... now there's an idea! </p> <p><strong> My Family</strong> has been touted as the first British sitcom to be created in the collaborative American mode, even including a writer with Seinfeld on his CV. Which is amusing mostly because the result is like an updated Butterflies, with Zoe Wanamaker in the good-mum-bad-cook Wendy Craig role and Robert Lindsay doing a slightly less lugubrious, though no less put-upon version of Geoffrey Palmer's dentist. It is full of those cheery, stagey, wacky one-liners that one can spot several miles away waiting patiently in a drivetime jam on the M25 ('Does the phrase \"pull the other one\" mean anything to you?', 'Ah!

And for toad-in-the-hole sans sausages, try 'toad-en-vacances'... except that these people would never eat toad in the hole any more). </p> <p>My Family is never less than relentlessly and unfashionably middle-class, but while the sofas are even bigger and squashier and the artful arrangement of objets even more contrived than those you'll find in a Judi Denchcom, I still enjoyed it because I loved Butterflies , which sort of attempted to grapple with the rising tide of Seventies feminism in a defi antly British (and therefore utterly woolly and suburban) context. Perhaps future storylines could push the sitcom envelope a wee bit further: adopting Chinese babies, say, or harvesting gold fillings from the bodies of patients who have died under Lindsay's local anaesthetic.

      "body": "<p><strong> Can We Afford This</strong> DV8, QEH, London SE1 </p> <p><strong> Bejart Ballet </strong> Sadler's Wells, London EC1 </p> <p>Pre-Olympic spectacle has finally spluttered into London, like a spent wave from Bondi Beach. We can now catch up with performances from the Olympic Arts Festival in Sydney last month: Sylvie Guillem gyrating on a table in Maurice Bejart's Bolero and DV8's <strong> Can We Afford This</strong>, commissioned by the festival. </p> <p>DV8's show, directed by Lloyd Newson, tackles issues raised by Olympic media coverage and coincidentally also by Bejart's company (Guillem guests tonight and tomorrow). What price the body beautiful? Are elite athletes worthy role models or fairground freaks? Students looking for dissertation topics will find plenty on DV8's website (<a href=\"http://www.dv8.co.uk\">www.dv8.co.uk</a>.) Can We Afford This purports to be 'a piece about perfection and pretence, of how society measures individuals and how we, in turn, value ourselves'. Actually, it's less of a heavyweight event, more of a variety show. </p> <p>The set is a masterpiece of theatrical illusion. Greensward covers a steep, people-eating slope: 'Keep Off the Grass' warns a sign. Transgressing bodies are swallowed by a sappy quagmire - but when David Toole pulls himself free by his powerful arms, we realise he has no bottom half. A passing performer assaults him with taboo questions about his truncated body: does he have an anus, can he have sex? Toole preserves his mystery by staring silently, quizzically, at the audience. His recompense for the offence is a series of duets more entrancing and disturbing than anything he danced with Candoco, the wheelchair-abled company. </p> <p>A cast of 17 performers materialises from trenches and pillars. Some sport funfair props - balloons, hoops, comic masks; others expose their bodies and souls. Interspersed with turns, 'true' confessions and interrogations come sections of pure dance. 'Blessed are the Average' proclaims a neon sign - but DV8's performers are anything but average. They are professionals, used to an audience's gaze: obese Larry Goldhuber, old Diana Payne-Myers and camp compere Paul Capsis, as well as the legless Toole. </p> <p>So we should not trust them when they present themselves as needy, abashed or boastful. Newson is not really confronting us with our voyeurism, as he has done in previous, harsher shows. He is playing games with bodies, words and images. He makes his troupe literally and metaphorically clown around, jump through hoops, put a spin on relationships, question the cost of living and of dancing. </p> <p>One man proposes to charge \u00a35 for graceful arm movements, with a surcharge for graceful arms with emotion. Another offers to pay stork-legged Kate Coyne to 'do that leg thing' - a virtuoso rond de jambe. A piece of tape is used to measure the length of an arm, a penis, a love affair. A suicide reckons that the price is too high and ends the show with a bang instead of a whimper. </p> <p>The rag-bag assembly of themes has not justified such a conclusion, nor the abrupt introduction of child abuse in the closing moments. In this rambling piece, Newson hasn't earned the right to go too far. He has also trespassed into Pina Bausch territory, which he can't afford to do if DV8 is to preserve its reputation for originality. Perhaps he should have waited until the Olympics fired his imagination - or indignation - before creating a piece about perfection. </p> <p>Sad to see <strong> Bejart Ballet</strong> in less than medal-winning form, recycling works that have been better danced in the past. Bejart's ballet-based choreography specialises in graceful arms with emotion and lots of 'that leg thing'. Themes tend to be inspirational; steps, like costumes, are minimal but arresting. Men go topless, with the better-honed torsos displayed in the front line. </p> <p>In Bolero (1961), the solo spot can be taken by a man or a woman: the predatory horde that closes in on the Chosen One, however, is invariably male. Today's athletic physiques mean that a gaunt girl on the table, whether she is Sylvie Guillem or Elisabet Ros, is much less sexy than the bare-chested man with leonine hair, Jorge Donne, on whom it was made. </p> <p>The brand-new work in the opening programme, Elton-Berg , posed some peculiar questions. An acrobatic woman, Karline Marion, was folded, origami-style, by two partners. The trio could qualify as a new Olympic gymnastic discipline, with points for spotting the difference in artistic interpretation when the same routine is performed first to music by Alban Berg and then by Elton John. What are we looking at when a woman is spatchcocked between two men, with or without emotion? What value do we place on the music that accompanies such contortions?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Can We Afford This DV8, QEH, London SE1 Bejart Ballet Sadler's Wells, London EC1 Pre-Olympic spectacle has finally spluttered into London, like a spent wave from Bondi Beach. We can now catch up with performances from the Olympic Arts Festival in Sydney last month: Sylvie Guillem gyrating on a table in Maurice Bejart's Bolero and DV8's Can We Afford This, commissioned by the festival. DV8's show, directed by Lloyd Newson, tackles issues raised by Olympic media coverage and coincidentally also by Bejart's company (Guillem guests tonight and tomorrow). What price the body beautiful? Are elite athletes worthy role models or fairground freaks? Students looking for dissertation topics will find plenty on DV8's website (www.dv8.co.uk.) Can We Afford This purports to be 'a piece about perfection and pretence, of how society measures individuals and how we, in turn, value ourselves'. Actually, it's less of a heavyweight event, more of a variety show. The set is a masterpiece of theatrical illusion. Greensward covers a steep, people-eating slope: 'Keep Off the Grass' warns a sign. Transgressing bodies are swallowed by a sappy quagmire - but when David Toole pulls himself free by his powerful arms, we realise he has no bottom half. A passing performer assaults him with taboo questions about his truncated body: does he have an anus, can he have sex? Toole preserves his mystery by staring silently, quizzically, at the audience. His recompense for the offence is a series of duets more entrancing and disturbing than anything he danced with Candoco, the wheelchair-abled company. A cast of 17 performers materialises from trenches and pillars. Some sport funfair props - balloons, hoops, comic masks; others expose their bodies and souls. Interspersed with turns, 'true' confessions and interrogations come sections of pure dance. 'Blessed are the Average' proclaims a neon sign - but DV8's performers are anything but average. They are professionals, used to an audience's gaze: obese Larry Goldhuber, old Diana Payne-Myers and camp compere Paul Capsis, as well as the legless Toole. So we should not trust them when they present themselves as needy, abashed or boastful. Newson is not really confronting us with our voyeurism, as he has done in previous, harsher shows. He is playing games with bodies, words and images. He makes his troupe literally and metaphorically clown around, jump through hoops, put a spin on relationships, question the cost of living and of dancing. One man proposes to charge \u00a35 for graceful arm movements, with a surcharge for graceful arms with emotion. Another offers to pay stork-legged Kate Coyne to 'do that leg thing' - a virtuoso rond de jambe. A piece of tape is used to measure the length of an arm, a penis, a love affair. A suicide reckons that the price is too high and ends the show with a bang instead of a whimper. The rag-bag assembly of themes has not justified such a conclusion, nor the abrupt introduction of child abuse in the closing moments. In this rambling piece, Newson hasn't earned the right to go too far. He has also trespassed into Pina Bausch territory, which he can't afford to do if DV8 is to preserve its reputation for originality. Perhaps he should have waited until the Olympics fired his imagination - or indignation - before creating a piece about perfection. Sad to see Bejart Ballet in less than medal-winning form, recycling works that have been better danced in the past. Bejart's ballet-based choreography specialises in graceful arms with emotion and lots of 'that leg thing'. Themes tend to be inspirational; steps, like costumes, are minimal but arresting. Men go topless, with the better-honed torsos displayed in the front line. In Bolero (1961), the solo spot can be taken by a man or a woman: the predatory horde that closes in on the Chosen One, however, is invariably male. Today's athletic physiques mean that a gaunt girl on the table, whether she is Sylvie Guillem or Elisabet Ros, is much less sexy than the bare-chested man with leonine hair, Jorge Donne, on whom it was made. The brand-new work in the opening programme, Elton-Berg , posed some peculiar questions. An acrobatic woman, Karline Marion, was folded, origami-style, by two partners. The trio could qualify as a new Olympic gymnastic discipline, with points for spotting the difference in artistic interpretation when the same routine is performed first to music by Alban Berg and then by Elton John. What are we looking at when a woman is spatchcocked between two men, with or without emotion? What value do we place on the music that accompanies such contortions?",

From the opening moments, in which the cast bursts from the back of the stage and sweeps through the audience, <strong> The Cherry Orchard</strong> is an engrossing experience. </p> <p>This production is already famous for casting Corin and Vanessa Redgrave as brother and sister landowners, but it should also be celebrated as an inspiriting piece of ensemble work. </p> <p>Meticulous detail and a grand sweep are combined, as Nunn combined them in his production of Gorki's closely related play, Summerfolk. The most gorgeous touch in Maria Bj\u00f8rnson's design is the creation of the orchard, projected above the action, its boughs outlined against a changing sky. The most revealing stroke is to scatter the stage with nursery furniture - a child-sized chair, a doll's pram. This play, Nunn's production makes clear, is about growing up - and failing to do so. </p> <p>Which is why casting the Redgraves is a triumph. Watching them, frolicking in middle age, clinging to each other in their family home, you see a couple whose past locks them together - and stops them from moving on. </p> <p>Corin Redgrave catches this creaky infantilism superbly. A garrulous fusspot, he mounts a rocking-horse to make a speech and tries to curb his tongue by buttoning up his lips, as a child does. </p> <p>His sister is - sometimes within one speech - unnerving, unconvincing and dazzling. She mutters some lines with a voice so flat and faltering it's as if she can scarcely be bothered to speak. You realise only afterwards that you've been tricked into hearing them afresh. She semaphores distress hammily. And then she flashes illumination. Urging an up-and-coming entrepreneur to marry her adopted daughter, she all the while seduces him herself, as she slowly caresses his head. </p> <p>But the success of the evening is not a sibling matter. David Lan's new translation is lively. The infinitely subtle Roger Allam makes the caressed entrepreneur into a newly sympathetic figure. Eve Best plays his would-be lover with a precisely-judged mixture of pain, crossness and bossiness. As the old retainer, Michael Bryant, apparently selfless but also self-absorbed, serves as the heart of the play. </p> <p>David Lan is everywhere at the moment. He is now offering up his first production as the new artistic director of the Young Vic, a visually glamorous, verbally null production of <strong> Julius Caesar</strong>. </p> <p>There's no shortage of wheezes here. The play is staged like a dream, with a series of figures taking turns to sit brooding above the action, outlined in a marmoreal light. More puzzlingly, Stephen Brimson Lewis's design, which runs a sloping plank of a stage through the centre of the audience, is waterlogged. Steam is in the air, puddles lap at the side of the stage; at the back, a line of showers twice sports a line of bare bums. </p> <p>These diffuse notions project a homoerotic, making-it-up-as-you-go-along world. But they don't add up to a governing idea. The walkway reduces the conspirators' rise and fall to a Grand- Old-Duke-of-York-style movement; the cast spends the evening marching up and down. There's little sense of the significance of their action, because there's little sense of an outside world: the mob is weedy; the booming sax used to signal danger suggests B-movie melodrama rather than cosmic disturbance. </p> <p>And there's a hole in the middle where people should be speaking the lines as if they made sense as well as a loud noise. Robert Cavanah is a persuasive, pragmatic Mark Antony, but he's alone in being both expressive and clear. As Brutus, Lloyd Owen is equipped with a thrilling voice and soldierly resolution, but no sense of disquiet. Marcus D'Amico's Cassius, who has a well-fed look, postures in black leather, chopping the air with his arms and the verse with meaningless pauses and emphases. </p> <p>When Ted Hughes died in 1998, he left a version of <strong> Alcestis </strong> which proves full of marvels. Hughes preserves the great span of Euripides's play, with its grief, decorum and generosity. He adds an urgent, combative seam of his own. The Hughes estate, wanting the play to be performed in the Calder Valley where the poet was born, and which he called his 'tuning-fork', made a gift of its premiere to Barrie Rutter, winner of the Creative Britons Award 2000 for his work with the Yorkshire-based and Yorkshire-speaking Northern Broadsides. </p> <p>The play, finished only months before Hughes's death, has a particular, much-vaunted interest. Hughes's Alcestis mourns the death of a wife, and speaks in a painful way of marriage as a state in which your nerves are likely to be flayed by loss. It's impossible to see it without thinking of the poet's married life, not least because its language contains echoes of Sylvia Plath's poetry. </p> <p>But the comparison shouldn't be pushed. This play features a king who, doomed to die, is saved when his wife offers to sacrifice herself. To claim it as autobiography is to act as a know-it-all jury in the manner of those who scrape Hughes's name off Plath's grave. </p> <p>It's also to diminish wonderful things in the play. One of these is a definition of greatness of spirit - behaving generously while bowed with grief - which anyone, humanist or pious, might be proud to claim. Another is the addition of a vigorous, sometimes gory riff on the labours of Hercules. </p> <p>Northern Broadsides' use of Yorkshire speech works well here, not just because, as it happens, Alcestis is set in a northern region of Greece. Otherwise, the production is insecure. Everyone bellows; no one moves fluidly. And though the cavernous Viaduct Theatre, with its great arches and underground echoes, serves equally well for palace chambers and for Hades, Rutter has made the weird decision partially to domesticate the space with cosy furnishings. </p> <p>Two of the chorus have bright blue bonnets, as modelled by the Tellytubbies; one courtier has his head wrapped up like a plum pudding. The play now tours.</p>",

You realise only afterwards that you've been tricked into hearing them afresh. She semaphores distress hammily. And then she flashes illumination. Urging an up-and-coming entrepreneur to marry her adopted daughter, she all the while seduces him herself, as she slowly caresses his head. But the success of the evening is not a sibling matter. David Lan's new translation is lively. The infinitely subtle Roger Allam makes the caressed entrepreneur into a newly sympathetic figure. Eve Best plays his would-be lover with a precisely-judged mixture of pain, crossness and bossiness. As the old retainer, Michael Bryant, apparently selfless but also self-absorbed, serves as the heart of the play. David Lan is everywhere at the moment. He is now offering up his first production as the new artistic director of the Young Vic, a visually glamorous, verbally null production of Julius Caesar. There's no shortage of wheezes here. The play is staged like a dream, with a series of figures taking turns to sit brooding above the action, outlined in a marmoreal light. More puzzlingly, Stephen Brimson Lewis's design, which runs a sloping plank of a stage through the centre of the audience, is waterlogged. Steam is in the air, puddles lap at the side of the stage; at the back, a line of showers twice sports a line of bare bums. These diffuse notions project a homoerotic, making-it-up-as-you-go-along world. But they don't add up to a governing idea. The walkway reduces the conspirators' rise and fall to a Grand- Old-Duke-of-York-style movement; the cast spends the evening marching up and down. There's little sense of the significance of their action, because there's little sense of an outside world: the mob is weedy; the booming sax used to signal danger suggests B-movie melodrama rather than cosmic disturbance. And there's a hole in the middle where people should be speaking the lines as if they made sense as well as a loud noise. Robert Cavanah is a persuasive, pragmatic Mark Antony, but he's alone in being both expressive and clear. As Brutus, Lloyd Owen is equipped with a thrilling voice and soldierly resolution, but no sense of disquiet. Marcus D'Amico's Cassius, who has a well-fed look, postures in black leather, chopping the air with his arms and the verse with meaningless pauses and emphases. When Ted Hughes died in 1998, he left a version of Alcestis which proves full of marvels. Hughes preserves the great span of Euripides's play, with its grief, decorum and generosity. He adds an urgent, combative seam of his own. The Hughes estate, wanting the play to be performed in the Calder Valley where the poet was born, and which he called his 'tuning-fork', made a gift of its premiere to Barrie Rutter, winner of the Creative Britons Award 2000 for his work with the Yorkshire-based and Yorkshire-speaking Northern Broadsides. The play, finished only months before Hughes's death, has a particular, much-vaunted interest. Hughes's Alcestis mourns the death of a wife, and speaks in a painful way of marriage as a state in which your nerves are likely to be flayed by loss. It's impossible to see it without thinking of the poet's married life, not least because its language contains echoes of Sylvia Plath's poetry. But the comparison shouldn't be pushed. This play features a king who, doomed to die, is saved when his wife offers to sacrifice herself. To claim it as autobiography is to act as a know-it-all jury in the manner of those who scrape Hughes's name off Plath's grave. It's also to diminish wonderful things in the play. One of these is a definition of greatness of spirit - behaving generously while bowed with grief - which anyone, humanist or pious, might be proud to claim. Another is the addition of a vigorous, sometimes gory riff on the labours of Hercules. Northern Broadsides' use of Yorkshire speech works well here, not just because, as it happens, Alcestis is set in a northern region of Greece. Otherwise, the production is insecure. Everyone bellows; no one moves fluidly. And though the cavernous Viaduct Theatre, with its great arches and underground echoes, serves equally well for palace chambers and for Hades, Rutter has made the weird decision partially to domesticate the space with cosy furnishings. Two of the chorus have bright blue bonnets, as modelled by the Tellytubbies; one courtier has his head wrapped up like a plum pudding. The play now tours.",

      "body": "<p>There has always been a Harold Pinter who wanted to escape detection: as a young actor, he changed his name to David Baron. His first poem was published under the semi-false name of Pinta. In his plays, his characters are anything but known. They are often hailed as people they may - or may not - actually be. Even the most ordinary identities are open to doubt. On 10 October, Harold Pinter will turn 70. To all intents and purpose, he is a 'recognised' figure. But do we know who he is? Or has he, for 50 years, succeeded in giving us the slip? Should we still be asking the question that Mick drops with casual force at the end of the first act of The Caretaker : 'What's the game?' </p> <p>There will be a birthday party for Pinter on 9 October, hosted by Faber, his publishers. The invitation stipulates 'no presents'. Yet I like to imagine that Pinter might be given, as Stanley is in The Birthday Party , a drum to unwrap. And then, like Stanley, he could beat it with that mixture of anger, concentration and panache that we have come to see as Pinteresque. But even in the absence of any drum, it is clear that there will be no shortage of people volunteering to blow Pinter's trumpet for him. All this week, I feel I have been attending a surreal party for Pinter, conducted by telephone, talking to friends, writers, actors and directors. But the extraordinary thing is that everyone has wanted to celebrate something different. And while almost no one has hesitated to define the adjective 'Pinteresque', no definition has been the same. Indeed, there is so much energy in the adjective, it should at once, I think, be promoted to become a verb. </p> <p>David Hare had a brilliant stab at trying to describe Pinter's 'game'. He claims he is 'heretical' about Pinter. He suggests that Pinter explodes 'European, existential ideas in a working-class setting'. It is this which 'leads to subsequent humour'. Hare goes further, placing Pinter above Beckett. 'I think he is one of the few disciples superior to the master, rooting Beckett in a real social world instead of an arid limbo.' As a skittish - but serious - postscript, he says he thinks that Monty Python is inspired by Pinter; the kerchiefed woman in The Room could, with a tweak or two, be played by Eric Idle. </p> <p>For Christopher Hampton, Pinter's voice is a mixture of 'truculence and enigma'. He is not surprised that Pinter claims not to know how he writes. While there are authors who claim to have been taken over by their characters in a way that seems whimsical, in Pinter's case, it would appear to be true. Hampton says Pinter will tell you not to be 'impertinent' if you inquire too closely about them. Plays arrive, for Pinter, it seems, rather as poems come to poets. 'You always wonder,' says Hampton 'whether Harold is a miraculous vessel through which something pours.' </p> <p>Peter Hall won't have any truck with the idea of an enigma that cannot be solved. He speaks as someone who has devoted a life to solving Pinteresque riddles and is not going to be deprived of the right to feel he has done so. He believes that 'structure' is the key to understanding the plays and that Pinter's imitators make the fatal mistake of allowing incompletely imagined situations to masquerade as mystery. Not that Hall is being reductive in any way: 'Pinter brought poetry back into the theatre; he said things by the unsaid. People make jokes about his pauses, but the pauses are as eloquent as the lines.' </p> <p>Joan Bakewell reminds us of the overwhelming presence in the plays of 'menace - the sense of a threat to existing relationships... illuminated by flashes of blazing comedy'. For Richard Eyre, he is also 'extraordinarily fresh and prescient'. For Ian McDiarmid, artistic director of the Almeida, he is a 'brilliant compressionist'. David Leveaux, director of No Man's Land, Betrayal and Moonlight at the Almeida, settles for one word to describe the Pinteresque: 'Suddenness'. </p> <p>Pinter is recognisable in all these definitions - and yet not contained by any of them. Perhaps it is Lenny's question in The Homecoming that needs answering next: 'In other words, apart from the known and the unknown, what else is there?' Pinter himself seems somewhere between the two. Earlier this year, the Almeida put on a double bill of his first play, The Room (1957), and his last, Celebration - directed by Pinter himself. There was an uncanny family likeness. Both took place in one room. ln each, cabin fever combined with a terror of the outside. </p> <p>It is tempting to think of Pinter's career as a series of rooms which together make up a remarkable, if draughty (his rooms tend to be draughty) house. In the same way, one can see Pinter's life as a series of rooms, starting with the Hackney living room where his father forbade the presence of Ulysses because he 'wouldn't have a book like that in the room where my mother served dinner' (the same sort of room as the one in The Birthday Party , where the word 'succulent' is banned over lunch). It is a long way from that room to the living room in the beautiful house in Holland Park that he shares with his second wife, Antonia Fraser. Not so far, though - at least in A-Z terms - from the theatrical room at the Almeida that Pinter has adopted as a home to his plays. </p> <p>Describing Pinter as a person, his friends speak almost as one. To an extraordinary number of people he is 'dear Harold'. The words that keep repeating themselves are 'generosity' 'loyalty' and 'wit' - along with 'exactness' and 'precision'. He is described as a good but painstaking talker with too great a respect for language ever to be idly garrulous. Christopher Hampton remembers being buoyed up by an encouraging note from Pinter at the start of his career. And there are many young playwrights now - Patrick Marber, Conor McPherson, Yasmina Reza - who acknowledge their debt to him. </p> <p>Pinter emerges as a director who makes life fun for actors, and an actor who is willing, as David Leveaux says, to be directed - even when the play is his own. He is a passionate cricketer, too. The actor Roger Lloyd Pack, who played in the Gaieties team of which Pinter was captain, remembers Pinter's delight in the details of the sport - 'the weather, the psychological effects, what is correct and what isn't, where your elbow is, how your stance is.' And Lloyd Pack does not think it fanciful to draw an analogy between Pinter's writing and cricket. 'In both, there is a loving attention to detail and a formality, a passion and correctness - the same concentration.' But he admits that Pinter was 'not a good loser. He is very competitive.' </p> <p>There is, famously, another side to Pinter's character. As Michael Frayn amusingly puts it: 'He has a notoriously short fuse and easily leaps to the conclusion, in the middle of a conversation about something else, that one is insufficiently serious about the evils of US foreign policy in Central America. But his fury is usually as short as his fuse, and two minutes after he has launched into you, he is likely to put his arm around you and make it up.' Peter Hall suggests that he is a 'strange combination of a thin skin and justifiable arrogance. He is easily hurt and misunderstood.' And there is another word that keeps coming up: 'power'. David Hare argues that Pinter is a 'poet of power. It is his basic currency and that is why he is sometimes an uncomfortable person to meet.' </p> <p>Henry Woolf has known Pinter since he was 17; they were at Hackney Downs school together. Woolf directed the 1957 production of The Room and appeared in the Almeida revival. When Woolf talks about Pinter, it is as though he were letting one in on a joke he has been enjoying for 50 years. He says that if anyone had collared him when he was 17 and told him that he and Harold would still be friends in 50 years' time and that Harold would be famous - he would and would not have believed it. He would have been taken aback at the idea of any friendship lasting so long. But otherwise, he would not have been surprised. 'You see, he was famous already. He gave out a charisma. It didn't matter if we only had tuppence in our pockets. If Harold was there, that is where the action was. Harold was always a front runner.' </p> <p>He adds that Harold was literally a front runner and that, in spite of 'going out with all the girls and smoking', he had no trouble with athletics, always beating his schoolmates to the finishing line. Harold was intellectually leader of the pack, too. It was Pinter who introduced his friends to Joyce, Dylan Thomas and Beckett. But in those days, just after the war, Woolf says they were 'determined not to be trapped by history. Pinter carved out his own history. He has never pretended to be anything he isn't.' </p> <p>Woolf suggests that even Pinter's plays are in some sense political, though the later ones more crusadingly so. Michael Billington, in his illuminating biography, makes much of the fact that Pinter was a conscientious objector; and David Hare suspects that 'his spirit was always radical'. But I detect more respect than enthusiasm for Pinter's later political plays such as Mountain Language . When asked to choose a favourite Pinter play, David Hare, Richard Eyre and Peter Hall all opt for The Homecoming (1965). Michael Frayn regards Betrayal (1978) as his best, and David Leveaux would presumably not disagree; he has directed it in London, Paris and Tokyo and is now working on a production with Juliette Binoche in New York. Joan Bakewell, understandably, does not choose Betrayal (she was Pinter's mistress for a time - and inspired it). She refers to it as a 'fine play', though 'it took me a while to be able to see it'. The Caretaker is her favourite. </p> <p>Only Michael Frayn and Tom Stoppard baulked at trying to define Pinter's essence. Stoppard said he has never been able to understand how Pinter does what he does. As a young man, seeing Rattigan, Osborne or Wesker, he used to think: 'I could do that myself, if only I was clever enough.' But in 1959, when he first saw The Birthday Party , he realised he could never copy Pinter. 'I couldn't see how it was done.' Nowadays, he feels that everything has been said about Harold Pinter... everything and nothing. In other words: the game is not up. </p> <p><strong>A birthday card from his friends</strong></p> <p>'He was Pinter from the beginning. As a nameless dramatist once said: I feel sorry for Harold. Other people can choose between comedy and tragedy, Pinter always has to write a Pinter play' <br><strong> Peter Hall</strong> </p> <p>'His own certainty about his talent is vindicated 100 per cent. There is no one who doesn't admire him.' <br><strong> David Hare</strong> </p> <p>'Pinter writes from his unconscious to the page. The door then shuts and he can only dimly remember his way back. He writes and then he becomes aware.' <br><strong> David Leveaux</strong> </p> <p>'One of the things about Betrayal is how many people recognise themselves in it.' <br><strong> Joan Bakewell</strong> </p> <p>'Mature ladies who have got their lives and their marriages still talk of him with special affection.' <br><strong> Henry Woolf</strong> on Pinter's former girlfriends </p> <p>'I think people will be going to Pinter's plays in 100 years time. He has such an individual voice; it may move in and out of focus but it won't disappear.'<br> <strong> Richard Eyre</strong> </p> <p>'At the Almeida in the offices above the rehearsal room we take our shoes off. Pinter is in the business of trying to create silences. We understand that perfectly.' <br><strong> Ian McDiarmid</strong> </p> <p>'Dramatic suspense is to do with the flow of information to the audience. Pinter achieves this in a way that is unique to himself.'<br><strong> Tom Stoppard</strong> </p> <p>'He's not dead is he? Oh good. Haven't we been here before? When Pinter turned 50 I was asked to say something and couldn't think of anything. Later I thought there should be a two-minute silence.' <br><strong> Alan Bennett</strong></p>",

The Jury Prize at Cannes last May went to the 20-year-old Samira Makhmalbaf's Blackboards. The most widely praised film shown in Britain this summer is Majid Majidi's The Colour of Paradise. The winner of the Golden Bear at Venice two weeks ago was The Circle, directed by Jafar Panahi, a former assistant to Abbas Kiarostami, who won the jury prize at Venice last year for his masterly <b> The Wind Will Carry Us</b>, which opens here this week. </p> <p>Characteristically, the movie turns on an encounter between westernised sophisticates from Tehran and seemingly simple country folk, and it features what has become Kiarostami's signature device - the extended take of a driver on a dusty road, talking away in long-shot or close-up to his passenger. In this case, a casually dressed, neatly shaven man comes with several colleagues to a remote village in Iranian Kurdistan. He puts the word around the Black Valley that they're after treasure, though most villagers believe him to be involved in telecommunications and everyone addresses him respectfully as 'Mr Engineer'. </p> <p>It transpires that he's there in connection with a dying woman whose 12-year-old grandson he befriends, but he doesn't approach her directly. The nature of his project isn't disclosed and we never see the colleagues he calls 'my crew' who, we're invited to infer, are filmmakers. The Engineer, for all his urban superiority, is an anxious man and not his own master. He's forever being phoned on his mobile from Tehran. Each time (a running joke that gathers momentum), he hops into his car and makes a tortuous drive to a cemetery on a hill top to receive a clear signal from a mysterious Mrs Godzani in the national capital. Her name inevitably suggests Godot, and The Wind Will Carry Us creates that air of existential unease and spiritual dread we associate with Beckett and Pinter. </p> <p>Nothing much seems to happen, little is explained. But in fact this quiet, labyrinthine village is teeming with life and the Engineer brings everyone together to save a stranger he converses with but never sees, who's trapped in a hole he's digging near the cemetery. There are astonishing images in Kiarostami's film, and odd encounters like the journey the Engineer makes as pillion passenger of an elderly GP who rides around the countryside on his little motorbike admiring the scenery, and blithely confesses to being of little practical use. At the end of this movie, as after an evening with Vladimir and Estragon, you feel you've been on a remarkable odyssey while standing still. This form of realism offers no easy answers, it just points to the unfathomable mystery of life. </p> <p>The week's other film of distinction, Marco Bechis's <b> Garage Olimpo</b>, also comes from a country that has recently suffered under a peculiarly repressive regime, though in this case the malaise is confronted directly. The setting is Buenos Aires in the late 1970s, and the Argentine military junta is rounding up opponents, dissidents and troublemakers, torturing them in subterranean garages, 'vaccinating' them with lethal injections and dumping the bodies from air-force transport planes over the Atlantic. The movie turns upon Maria, an idealistic 18-year-old Franco-Italian who is arrested on suspicion of working with an anti-government organisation. She discovers that one of her interrogator-torturers is the unassuming young man to whom her mother lets a room. This is a quiet, measured movie about the theory and practice of hell, contrasting the orderly, oblivious city, neon-lit by night, sunny by day, with the dark, horrific underground world of the vindictive, exploitative secret police who control both. The film is the more chilling for the way the door is shut when torture and violent acts take place, but we're shown the terrible consequences. </p> <p>In <b> Me, Myself &amp; Irene</b>, the Farrelly Brothers compound the offence of There's Something About Mary without being anything like as funny, and they fail to provide Ren\u00e9e Zellweger with the kind of endearing role they gave Cameron Diaz. On to a comic pursuit thriller (rogue cops seek to eliminate female witness) they've imposed every possible kind of offensive joke, daring us to laugh lest we expose our deficient sense of humour. A man waking up to discover a 10-inch dildo in his rectum is par for this particular course. The better jokes stem from the policeman hero (Jim Carrey) having been cuckolded by a black dwarf, chairman of the Boston branch of Mensa, and having loving black triplets as his brilliant, foul-mouthed sons. Various mental health societies have objected to the Carrey character being identified as a schizophrenic. They have a point. But the movie is really only a comic take on Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, or more precisely a homage to The Nutty Professor, the re-working of Stevenson's tale by Carrey's idol Jerry Lewis. </p> <p><b> Play It To the Bone</b> is the poorest picture to date by writer-director Ron Shelton, a former baseball professional who really knows the world of sport. Woody Harrelson and Antonio Banderas look far too unscathed to be washed-up middleweight boxers driving with their joint girlfriend to Las Vegas to beat the shit out of each other for money and a last shot at the title as a warm-up bout for Mike Tyson. The characters are coarse, but the film itself is coarser, as well as overlong and poorly written. Not a patch on Huston's Fat City. </p> <p><b> Elephant Juice</b> comes from the deviser (Amy Jenkins) and director (Sam Miller) of This Life and is a would-be knowing look at the lives of eight well-heeled, narcissistic Londoners aged around 30 and having trouble with love and commitment. Its seven chapters are prefaced by questions (eg 'Is your sex life a natural expression of love?', 'Where does the pain come from?') which are as witless as the answers. Emmanuelle B\u00e9art as a city high-flier seems as bewildered by what she has to say as by the milieu into which she's been dropped. </p> <p>Worse, but arguably more ambitious, is Terence Gross's<b> Hotel Splendide</b>, an attempt to graft Delicatessen on to Fawlty Towers. Set at a run-down spa hotel on an island off the English coast, it's some sort of allegory about a nation in an advanced state of decay and denial. A strong cast struggles desperately with intractable material. </p> <p>Before the coming of the Beatles, Alun Owen (who scripted A Hard Day's Night) put Liverpool on the map with hard-hitting TV plays like Last Tram to Lime Street, as well as scripting one of the finest British gangster and prison pictures, Joseph Losey's The Criminal. The biggest plus about Jim Doyle's promising debut, <b> Going Off, Big Time</b>, is that it takes us from Mockney London to lowlife Merseyside for its cautionary tale of a decent lad becoming a gangster after serving four desensitising years in jail. Bernard Hill is splendid as an old lag, but the movie, which sets out to be a Merseyside Mean Streets, is uncertain in tone. </p> <p>The British Short Film Festival continues through to Thursday at the Empire Leicester Square with its usual crop of striking movies from all over. Old age and death are the dominant subjects, and I especially commend, because good and representative, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pelle's Des morceaux de ma femme , in which an elderly French man attempts to divest himself of every memory of his late wife and go naked in the world; and Vikki Blanche's The Other Days of Ruby Ray, where an old widowed vicar (the great Norman Kaye) has his faith renewed by a numinous 10-year-old girl in the Australian Outback.</p>",

      "byline": "Laura Cumming",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Apocalypse: Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art</strong> Royal Academy, London SW1 until 15 December </p> <p>This was the glum prospect, as hyped by an alarmist press: a couple of porn stars grinding away, a meteorite felling the Pope, and 10,000 jackbooted Nazis tearing each other apart. A German artist was going to frighten the life out of us with a dark and dripping cellar. There would be X-rated rooms, bus stops from Auschwitz and all manner of mind-jolting shocks. </p> <p>Norman Rosenthal, the show's co-curator, made the traditional pre-emptive statement in which he criticised the public's reluctance to square up to the brutalities of life. Dare you face the horror, the horror? The gauntlet was thrown down with a thwack. </p> <p>If it's true horror you seek, then <strong> Apocalypse</strong> isn't your show. Cod horror, Hollywood horror, ghost-train horror, maybe, but nothing that isn't several prophylactic stages removed from life's brutalities. The porn stars in Chris Cunningham's video are slick with Vaseline and panstick, their sex-and-violence routine, for all its furious spilling of blood, aims for Francis Bacon but falls somewhere between a Nike ad and the twitchy rhythms of Lara Croft. The Pope beneath his meteorite is too much of a waxwork to give up the ghost. As for Jake and Dinos Chapman's Nazis - well, we'll come to them in a moment. So 'Apocalypse' is hardly the seven-headed beast of Revelation, rising from the waves to smite you with dread. Don't trust the hyperbole of that subtitle, either. Horror and beauty in contemporary art are like Gilbert and Sullivan in light opera. They go together - and they always have, like the butchered hare and the peaches in a Dutch still-life. Some of the best works in this show, by Luc Tuymans, for example, have something to say about both. But the more obvious contrast here is between the very good and the mediocre. </p> <p>The staging of the show is a spectacle in itself. I've never seen the Royal Academy more superbly transformed. To enter 'Apocalypse', you have to squeeze through a door no bigger than the trap to a coalhole and creep down the narrow staircase into Gregor Schneider's cellar. This shunts you out into a sequence of disconnected scenes - a red-carpet sacristy for the Pope, a sepulchral museum for the Chapman vitrines, cool, clear space for Mariko Mori's pagoda, wedding-cake d\u00e9cor for Jeff Koons's kitsch. </p> <p>Schneider's cellar is supposed to be authentic, a maze of dark, clammy corridors removed in its entirety from the artist's Rhineland home. In fact, it feels exactly like what it is - a stage set that he built inside the basement walls. It feels distinctly theatrical, with its creaking doors and Hammer effects. </p> <p>The denouement comes with a short film projected in the garish gloom in which a camera haunts this space, nosing its way past radiators and down corridors - think of The Shining and, come to that, Eraserhead . All of them are rather more potent than Schneider's installation, although there is a sharp frisson on exit when you look back and discover how cramped the place really was, what a tiny distance you actually travelled. </p> <p>Maurizio Catellan's Pope has celluloid forebears, too, in this case the face-down prelate in Un chien Andalou, burdened with a piano containing a donkey's corpse. But the prostration of John Paul II is hardly so savage or surreal. The fake meteorite that has supposedly plunged through the ceiling - a hole has been engineered in the skylight - rests upon a waxwork with its vestments still in perfect order. The Pope has his eyes closed and frowns as if in prayer. He is down, but not out; indeed, he looks a sight more robust than the pontiff himself. Catellan has a genuine gift for tragi-comedy, but his latest piece makes no headway in either direction. It feels like a punchline without the joke. You can't get close to the Pope - he's yards away behind the barrier ropes. Crowds strain to see what's going on through the scrummage of shoulders. It's a tactical measure, consistent with the governing principle of this show, which is that you should always be aware that you're having the Apocalypse Experience. </p> <p>There is the bottleneck at the cellar door, the traffic jam hoping to get into Cunningham's 18-Only video, the massive tailback queueing for Mori's pagoda. The pagoda is a completely entrancing construction. Made of many different kinds of glass, it has doors of liquid crystal that fluctuate in colour at any human approach. The whole effect is of a fairytale mirage, the aurora borealis momentarily frozen. But if you're thinking of queuing for the film inside - one person at a time, special slippers provided, phone bookings taken - then let me tell you that it's a spacey reel of pretty raindrops and swirly planets. More fun to be had at your local Imax. </p> <p>Only two seats are available for Mike Kelley's LA movie, which is a pity because it's a lot more substantial than his usual sorry offering of discarded toys. A Domestic Scene is filmed in one continuous take, a bit like Hitchcock's Rope , which it more than resembles with its histrionic couple threatening each other in a claustrophobic flat. The premise is absurd - one has no idea how he got there, the other claims he's sullied their love nest. This is an art farce - 'let's make an abstract expressionist painting of our passion' - but it's also an un-American satire with a mordant punchline. </p> <p>Kelley's compatriot, Jeff Koons, is showing a gigantic steel cast of one of those squeaky little balloon-dogs that adults make for children's parties. The surface is gorgeous, the metallic red of a Christmas-tree bauble. And a strange transformation has occurred - the twisted knots now look like navels, the ears like polished missiles. But compared to Luc Tuymans's transfixingly eerie paintings, with their ghostly rooms and dematerialising faces, Koons's hot dog is atrium art. </p> <p>Tuymans is better known for painting diseased and injured bodies. But the RA doesn't go for these; in fact, it's pretty cavalier about the whole idea of an apocalypse, taking it to mean anything that adds voltage to its switchback ride. That ride has its dips and highs, masterfully choreographed. It sends you from the thundering Aphex Twin soundtrack of Cunningham's video straight into the pastoral quiet of Tim Noble and Sue Webster's captivating shadowplay. Backlit with a simple yellow bulb, a tottering heap of rubbish casts its silhouette against the wall: two figures sit peacefully on a summit, a breeze stirring the grass at sunset. The grass is a tangled skein of cassette tape, the breeze created by the movement of visitors through the gallery. I'd guess that this will be many people's favourite piece and not just because it's beautiful - which it is - or because it reveals its own low-tech artistry. That part is simple: junk into gold. But the silhouette allows your mind to roam - summers past, high vistas, maybe Beckett's Happy Days with its sunset at the end of the world. </p> <p>None of the art in 'Apocalypse' was made especially for this show. Two generations are represented and six different nations, so you couldn't feasibly elaborate some definition of art as it's happening. But there is a presiding taste here - Rosenthal has claimed it as his own - and it's reflected in the staging of the show. So much of this art is filtered through Hollywood, the box and the ad trade - from Koons's cereal-packet paintings to the sci-fi spacemen ushering you into Mori's pagoda - that it would be surprising if the experience wasn't brash and exciting. In these conditions, artists like Tuymans, Kelley, Noble and Webster are bound to stand out in the shallows. </p> <p>There is an apocalyptic work in this show, the only one that tries to envisage human horror as a never-ending cycle played out in the afterlife as it already has been on earth. This is the Chapman brothers' diorama, a vast scale-model of Hell, fulsomely detailed, baroque in its excess. Thousands of inch-high Nazis are being flayed, disembowelled, crucified and torched - by other Nazis as by those mutant mannequins that have become the Chapman trademark. History is there in the camps and gas chambers, in the jungle landscapes that echo Korea and Vietnam, in the idea of an endless loop - so painstakingly realised. But it's boxed history, with an easy target and a model-shop aesthetic of spongy furze, Humbrol paint and indestructible soldiers. More than that, it is Indiana Jones, Nightmare Freddie and Francis Ford Coppola, assembling another row of severed heads on spikes. Hell as mediated through multiple media. Small apocalypse, nobody hurt.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Apocalypse: Beauty and Horror in Contemporary Art Royal Academy, London SW1 until 15 December This was the glum prospect, as hyped by an alarmist press: a couple of porn stars grinding away, a meteorite felling the Pope, and 10,000 jackbooted Nazis tearing each other apart. A German artist was going to frighten the life out of us with a dark and dripping cellar. There would be X-rated rooms, bus stops from Auschwitz and all manner of mind-jolting shocks. Norman Rosenthal, the show's co-curator, made the traditional pre-emptive statement in which he criticised the public's reluctance to square up to the brutalities of life. Dare you face the horror, the horror? The gauntlet was thrown down with a thwack. If it's true horror you seek, then Apocalypse isn't your show. Cod horror, Hollywood horror, ghost-train horror, maybe, but nothing that isn't several prophylactic stages removed from life's brutalities. The porn stars in Chris Cunningham's video are slick with Vaseline and panstick, their sex-and-violence routine, for all its furious spilling of blood, aims for Francis Bacon but falls somewhere between a Nike ad and the twitchy rhythms of Lara Croft. The Pope beneath his meteorite is too much of a waxwork to give up the ghost. As for Jake and Dinos Chapman's Nazis - well, we'll come to them in a moment. So 'Apocalypse' is hardly the seven-headed beast of Revelation, rising from the waves to smite you with dread. Don't trust the hyperbole of that subtitle, either. Horror and beauty in contemporary art are like Gilbert and Sullivan in light opera. They go together - and they always have, like the butchered hare and the peaches in a Dutch still-life. Some of the best works in this show, by Luc Tuymans, for example, have something to say about both. But the more obvious contrast here is between the very good and the mediocre. The staging of the show is a spectacle in itself. I've never seen the Royal Academy more superbly transformed. To enter 'Apocalypse', you have to squeeze through a door no bigger than the trap to a coalhole and creep down the narrow staircase into Gregor Schneider's cellar. This shunts you out into a sequence of disconnected scenes - a red-carpet sacristy for the Pope, a sepulchral museum for the Chapman vitrines, cool, clear space for Mariko Mori's pagoda, wedding-cake d\u00e9cor for Jeff Koons's kitsch. Schneider's cellar is supposed to be authentic, a maze of dark, clammy corridors removed in its entirety from the artist's Rhineland home. In fact, it feels exactly like what it is - a stage set that he built inside the basement walls. It feels distinctly theatrical, with its creaking doors and Hammer effects. The denouement comes with a short film projected in the garish gloom in which a camera haunts this space, nosing its way past radiators and down corridors - think of The Shining and, come to that, Eraserhead . All of them are rather more potent than Schneider's installation, although there is a sharp frisson on exit when you look back and discover how cramped the place really was, what a tiny distance you actually travelled. Maurizio Catellan's Pope has celluloid forebears, too, in this case the face-down prelate in Un chien Andalou, burdened with a piano containing a donkey's corpse. But the prostration of John Paul II is hardly so savage or surreal. The fake meteorite that has supposedly plunged through the ceiling - a hole has been engineered in the skylight - rests upon a waxwork with its vestments still in perfect order. The Pope has his eyes closed and frowns as if in prayer. He is down, but not out; indeed, he looks a sight more robust than the pontiff himself. Catellan has a genuine gift for tragi-comedy, but his latest piece makes no headway in either direction. It feels like a punchline without the joke. You can't get close to the Pope - he's yards away behind the barrier ropes. Crowds strain to see what's going on through the scrummage of shoulders. It's a tactical measure, consistent with the governing principle of this show, which is that you should always be aware that you're having the Apocalypse Experience. There is the bottleneck at the cellar door, the traffic jam hoping to get into Cunningham's 18-Only video, the massive tailback queueing for Mori's pagoda. The pagoda is a completely entrancing construction. Made of many different kinds of glass, it has doors of liquid crystal that fluctuate in colour at any human approach. The whole effect is of a fairytale mirage, the aurora borealis momentarily frozen. But if you're thinking of queuing for the film inside - one person at a time, special slippers provided, phone bookings taken - then let me tell you that it's a spacey reel of pretty raindrops and swirly planets. More fun to be had at your local Imax. Only two seats are available for Mike Kelley's LA movie, which is a pity because it's a lot more substantial than his usual sorry offering of discarded toys. A Domestic Scene is filmed in one continuous take, a bit like Hitchcock's Rope , which it more than resembles with its histrionic couple threatening each other in a claustrophobic flat. The premise is absurd - one has no idea how he got there, the other claims he's sullied their love nest. This is an art farce - 'let's make an abstract expressionist painting of our passion' - but it's also an un-American satire with a mordant punchline. Kelley's compatriot, Jeff Koons, is showing a gigantic steel cast of one of those squeaky little balloon-dogs that adults make for children's parties. The surface is gorgeous, the metallic red of a Christmas-tree bauble. And a strange transformation has occurred - the twisted knots now look like navels, the ears like polished missiles. But compared to Luc Tuymans's transfixingly eerie paintings, with their ghostly rooms and dematerialising faces, Koons's hot dog is atrium art. Tuymans is better known for painting diseased and injured bodies. But the RA doesn't go for these; in fact, it's pretty cavalier about the whole idea of an apocalypse, taking it to mean anything that adds voltage to its switchback ride. That ride has its dips and highs, masterfully choreographed. It sends you from the thundering Aphex Twin soundtrack of Cunningham's video straight into the pastoral quiet of Tim Noble and Sue Webster's captivating shadowplay. Backlit with a simple yellow bulb, a tottering heap of rubbish casts its silhouette against the wall: two figures sit peacefully on a summit, a breeze stirring the grass at sunset. The grass is a tangled skein of cassette tape, the breeze created by the movement of visitors through the gallery. I'd guess that this will be many people's favourite piece and not just because it's beautiful - which it is - or because it reveals its own low-tech artistry. That part is simple: junk into gold. But the silhouette allows your mind to roam - summers past, high vistas, maybe Beckett's Happy Days with its sunset at the end of the world. None of the art in 'Apocalypse' was made especially for this show. Two generations are represented and six different nations, so you couldn't feasibly elaborate some definition of art as it's happening. But there is a presiding taste here - Rosenthal has claimed it as his own - and it's reflected in the staging of the show. So much of this art is filtered through Hollywood, the box and the ad trade - from Koons's cereal-packet paintings to the sci-fi spacemen ushering you into Mori's pagoda - that it would be surprising if the experience wasn't brash and exciting. In these conditions, artists like Tuymans, Kelley, Noble and Webster are bound to stand out in the shallows. There is an apocalyptic work in this show, the only one that tries to envisage human horror as a never-ending cycle played out in the afterlife as it already has been on earth. This is the Chapman brothers' diorama, a vast scale-model of Hell, fulsomely detailed, baroque in its excess. Thousands of inch-high Nazis are being flayed, disembowelled, crucified and torched - by other Nazis as by those mutant mannequins that have become the Chapman trademark. History is there in the camps and gas chambers, in the jungle landscapes that echo Korea and Vietnam, in the idea of an endless loop - so painstakingly realised. But it's boxed history, with an easy target and a model-shop aesthetic of spongy furze, Humbrol paint and indestructible soldiers. More than that, it is Indiana Jones, Nightmare Freddie and Francis Ford Coppola, assembling another row of severed heads on spikes. Hell as mediated through multiple media. Small apocalypse, nobody hurt.",

      "body": "<p>From Samuel Richardson's instructive novel for young women, Clarissa (1747), to What A Young Woman Ought to Know (hot in the early 1900s), to the modern dating bible, The Rules, all the oh-so-earnest advice being dispensed to young women can be distilled into one dull command: don't put out. </p> <p>This is not what men want to hear. Yet in recent centuries even they have taken to saying it. And this woefully acceptable statement of the joyless is the product of the feminisation of male culture, wherein men 'feel for women' when they should just be plain feeling them. It's wrecked the whole dating game. The fun battle of the sexes has been cancelled owing to men defecting. </p> <p>Take the exquisite and tragically well-selling example of John Gray's sodden wet waffle for worriers, Men Are From Mars, Women are from Venus. Therein Uncle John tells our lost generation of lily-livered liberals that it's wrong to just expect a woman to put out. Apparently sex is all about intuition, timing and - naturellement - sensitivity (the much-favoured term of the self-obsessed and touchy). Well, do me with a porcupine on a bamboo stick! Be lost without you, John. </p> <p>If you haven't got sexy qualities you are not going to acquire them from a man who has nothing better to do with his time than boast in print about his wonderful technique and respect for womenhood. All modern sex manuals trade on neurosis and fear of sex and they show that the repressed worriers have the upper hand. They are nag-presents, given to cowed, modern men by fretting, modern women on the desperate assumption that a self-satisfied book will change their lover's personality. And the prideless bloke even says thanks, on occasion. The worried and hormoneless have been buying these sex-as-problem books for too long. It falls to men to foil this conspiracy of neurotics. It falls to men to shark, shamelessly. </p> <p>Instinct, taste and perhaps alcohol will decree when it is a good idea to have one's bones jumped. If you need a book to tell you then you're already doomed to eternal wetness (and I don't mean primed for fun). Reading a smug, worthy book about it is not going to help you judge. It's just going to make you smug and worthy. That PC culture seized the mantle of repression from Victorians, and kept us worrying about sex, is well-documented, especially by those who say we have moved beyond that and are now really sussed; postmodern or post-postmodern or postman-pat or whatever it is. But, like the Third Way, it's not a great fantasy. </p> <p>Where we would call our attitude to dating and sex 'enlightened and sensitive' now, many of our more bawdy, ribaldrous and pre-Victorian forebears would call it touchy, self-obsessed, fearful and - perhaps the most important point in our narcissistic times - self-conscious. Most people would agree that one's sex life is nobody's business except one's lovers, so why are all these do-gooders writing self-satisfied books explaining (inexplicable) sexuality and turning it from a joyous and deeply personal mystery into a consciously comprehensible and very public social science project? Of course, in many cases they are just trying to say 'I'm a great lay', yet their dry analysis suggests nothing more than a strong will to prove they are a great lay, and we all know how tiresome that is between the sheets. In his follow-up bestseller, imaginatively entitled Mars and Venus in the Bedroom, Gray actually tells us of a particularly good seeing-to he gave his wife. And right riveting it isn't too. </p> <p>There is a tragic dearth of self-help sages counterbalancing this supposedly sensitive attitude to sex. Most self-help manuals are of no practical use whatsoever except to make the uptight feel that their uptightness is 'understandable' (as opposed to amazingly dull at parties) and 'in hand' now that they've read Mr Great Lay's opus. But where is The Guide To How To Have Sex That May Or May Not Be A Really Bad Idea But Right Now I Don't Give A Monkeys ? That's the kind of book that would keep the species going, and make life interesting. There is no Put Outters Manual, no What A Young Shark Ought To Know, no Men Are From Mars They've Travelled Far So Please Give Them One.

      "bodyText": "From Samuel Richardson's instructive novel for young women, Clarissa (1747), to What A Young Woman Ought to Know (hot in the early 1900s), to the modern dating bible, The Rules, all the oh-so-earnest advice being dispensed to young women can be distilled into one dull command: don't put out. This is not what men want to hear. Yet in recent centuries even they have taken to saying it. And this woefully acceptable statement of the joyless is the product of the feminisation of male culture, wherein men 'feel for women' when they should just be plain feeling them. It's wrecked the whole dating game. The fun battle of the sexes has been cancelled owing to men defecting. Take the exquisite and tragically well-selling example of John Gray's sodden wet waffle for worriers, Men Are From Mars, Women are from Venus. Therein Uncle John tells our lost generation of lily-livered liberals that it's wrong to just expect a woman to put out. Apparently sex is all about intuition, timing and - naturellement - sensitivity (the much-favoured term of the self-obsessed and touchy). Well, do me with a porcupine on a bamboo stick! Be lost without you, John. If you haven't got sexy qualities you are not going to acquire them from a man who has nothing better to do with his time than boast in print about his wonderful technique and respect for womenhood. All modern sex manuals trade on neurosis and fear of sex and they show that the repressed worriers have the upper hand. They are nag-presents, given to cowed, modern men by fretting, modern women on the desperate assumption that a self-satisfied book will change their lover's personality. And the prideless bloke even says thanks, on occasion. The worried and hormoneless have been buying these sex-as-problem books for too long. It falls to men to foil this conspiracy of neurotics. It falls to men to shark, shamelessly. Instinct, taste and perhaps alcohol will decree when it is a good idea to have one's bones jumped. If you need a book to tell you then you're already doomed to eternal wetness (and I don't mean primed for fun). Reading a smug, worthy book about it is not going to help you judge. It's just going to make you smug and worthy. That PC culture seized the mantle of repression from Victorians, and kept us worrying about sex, is well-documented, especially by those who say we have moved beyond that and are now really sussed; postmodern or post-postmodern or postman-pat or whatever it is. But, like the Third Way, it's not a great fantasy.

      "body": "<p>In New York, Salman Rushdie may finally have found a city he likes as much as his home town. 'It's a Western rewrite of Bombay,' he says. 'There's a similar bustle and noise.' He is sitting in his agent's office in Midtown, genially ticking off the many ways Manhattan, to which he moved early this year, suits him. His tone is that of an excited tourist. He praises New York's 'famous electricity'. He loves 'being able to get lost' in Central Park and adores the fresh bread from the local bakeries. He says the city has a wonderful 'neighbourhoodliness'. </p> <p>This is not the ending anyone expected, least of all Rushdie himself. In 1989, when Ayatollah Khomeini ordered the faithful to track down and kill him for the alleged blasphemies in The Satanic Verses, Rushdie, now 53, thought he would soon be dead. He went into hiding, protected by the British Government. In the intervening years, hit squads killed the Japanese translator of the book, wounded the Italian translator and the Norwegian publisher - but Rushdie survived. In 1998, under pressure from Britain, Iran said it would not carry out the fatwa. Rushdie was free to resume his life, but what sort of life was left? </p> <p>There was resentment in England at the millions of pounds the Government had been spending to protect him. The British press dogged him, reinforcing its readership's sense that Rushdie had somehow brought his troubles on himself. Most of all, London had been the site of his captivity. He had lived in roughly 30 houses in nine years. It was time for something new. One choice for Rushdie might have been a small town where he could have written in relative anonymity. 'But what would I do in Iowa?' he asks. 'I'd commit suicide.' </p> <p>Instead, he came to Manhattan. 'The thing that always attracted me to New York was the sense of being in a place where a lot of people had a lot of stories not unlike mine,' Rushdie says. 'Everybody comes from somewhere else. Everyone's got a Polish grandmother, some kind of metamorphosis in their family circumstances. That's a very big thing - the experience of not living where you started. It changes you in all kinds of ways.' </p> <p>London did not spur his imagination. 'I think it speaks for itself that, for somebody who lived in England for as long as I did, relatively little of my work has dealt with it.' New York holds more promise. 'There's so much stuff just asking me to write it down here,' he says. 'You know, all the furniture on the street. What places are called. Everything has a different name. Toothpaste isn't called the same thing, coffee isn't called the same thing. I just walk into a supermarket here, and I'm having to look in a detailed way at stuff that everyone else would take for granted.' </p> <p>In April of last year, Rushdie had an operation for ptosis, a condition in which the eyelids sag to the point of impeding vision. The metaphor is not hard to tease out: Rushdie wanted to meet Manhattan with wide-open eyes. 'Discovery is fun,' he says. 'I am incredibly open to everything.' Others have seen the surgery, which has given him a younger look, as an act of vanity, the sign of a man in midlife crisis. Rushdie's social life has done nothing to dispel that interpretation. </p> <p>Though still married, he is dating a 29-year-old model. He seems to be everywhere. He is a regular at all the clubs of the moment; he was at the premiere of Madonna's latest movie. 'It just seems that the demarcations are less here,' he says. 'In London, you tend to find the actors are here and the artists are there and the writers are over here and there's not that much crossover between those worlds. Whereas here, I have very rapidly got to know people across all of those frontiers.' </p> <p>He says he is relieved that New York has less of the 'backbiting and incestuous' literary culture of London. He had dinner in April with Thomas Pynchon and discussed baseball. He knew a bit about this, having already gone to both of the city's ballparks. With Don DeLillo he went to a Yankees game. 'I must say, going to the ballgame with Don was one of the great things, because he goes with his mitt. He's up there for every fly ball.' Paul Auster in turn took him to see the Mets, 'because that's his orientation'. </p> <p>He also socialises with the British Empire's community of New York transplants, among them the Australian-born novelist Peter Carey, the Caribbean-born novelist Caryl Phillips and the Indian-born Sonny Mehta, the president of Knopf, who has published all of them. Rushdie remembers something Mehta said to him after his own first year in New York. 'He said, \"You know, Salman, for people like you and me, it's a very good idea at some point to leave the British Empire.\" And I think he's absolutely right.' </p> <p>I mention Padma Lakshmi, the Madras-born model he met last August at the inaugural party for Talk magazine. 'Things are very good as far as Padma and I are concerned,' he says. 'We're both happy.' Their outings make news in the gossip columns. </p> <p>He looks at his watch on the table. He had been writing all morning and is eager to go home and get back to work. He is a new man, Ferdinand washed up on the fabulous island of The Tempest - or maybe Balzac's Lucien de Rubempre, who left the provinces to take on Paris. Except Rushdie's own novels show how hard it is to leave the past behind. When Rushdie came to New York, he left his wife Elizabeth West, and their three-year-old son, Milan. A 21-year-old son, Zafar, from an earlier marriage, and to whom he is close, also lives in England. He returns frequently to visit them. </p> <p>The fatwa lives on, too, at least as a memory. He is subjected to comments by matre d's and bystanders. The comments are primarily joking, but no one, it seems, wants to be entirely safe around Rushdie. If people were, his celebrity might lose its currency. </p> <p>He complains that the newspapers give a misleading picture of his life. He spends most of his time, he says, going to ordinary neighbourhoods, dining at small restaurants and going for long walks, absorbing the city in places where 'the gossip columnists and the paparazzi aren't'. Before him always is the writer's imperative to be open to new experience. 'Until you find stuff out, you can't know what you think about it,' he says. 'The more places you can put yourself in... the better.' </p> <p>I point out that some writers are dismayed at his behaviour. People died because of his words. They think he owes the world gravitas. Is it proper for him to feel, as he says, 'lighter of heart' these days? After the fatwa, Martin Amis commented that his friend had disappeared on to the front page. Now he has reappeared on the gossip page. Fay Weldon says: 'Salman has made his home among the posers.' His friend Bill Buford, an editor at the New Yorker, points out that Rushdie has never done things by half measure. The paradox of the fatwa is that he was the last writer you could hide. 'Here's how Salman goes to a concert,' says Buford, who has been to several with him. 'He goes. He gets good seats. He gets up and boogies.' </p> <p>Rushdie does not like to talk about what he should do differently. He is at his core a writer, a man who sees life through stories. If you try to dictate the story of his life, you make him angry. In a sense, that's what the Ayatollah did, and that's what those who object to his current lifestyle are now doing. </p> <p>'My view is: to hell with that,' he says. 'This is my life, and I'll make my choices. I'm a big-city boy. What I like is big cities. It's not just what I like. It's what I write about.' He says his time in New York is all going into the grinder in preparation for literary production. </p> <p>He recently signed a contract with Random House for five books. The first, the one he is working on, is a thriller about a man who may or may not have committed a murder. The old part, the 'back story', is in Bombay. The new, 'the present moment', is in New York. </p> <p>This will be New York's second appearance in Rushdie's fiction. The city was also in The Ground Beneath Her Feet. In reviewing it, most critics focused on the story as a retelling of the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. Rushdie says it was also a meditation on 'three great cities' - Bombay, London and New York. </p> <p>In the novel, Bombay, where Rushdie was born to wealthy Muslim parents, comes in for extensive and loving handling. It is infused with the elegant magic with which he captured the city in his great second novel, Midnight's Children. London seems very much a place to get through, a transit port, just as it did in The Satanic Verses. New York, however, is the subject of adoration. </p> <p>'Where this city leads,' Rushdie writes, 'this Rome, all the world's cities follow.' Yet the novel's portrayal of the city feels hazy. His New York is the New York of clich\u00e9, with the biggest, tallest and most beautiful of everything. </p> <p>This first time around, he didn't find his New York,a New York special to him. He just recapitulated the New York that has long existed in the British literary mind, the New York of English literature from Fanny Trollope to Martin Amis. As a literary construct, it did not feel new. Rushdie wrote The Ground Beneath Her Feet while living in London and summering in East Hampton. He was just a visitor here. It was before those meandering walks in the park and those nights in nightclubs. As time goes by, he may see a different city, a sister city to Bombay with its polyglot culture and endless, fecund migrations. No one can foresee how the city will act on his imagination. Rushdie, the most imaginative and fractured of English-language novelists, says he is ready for whatever comes. 'I think the moment we're living in is a sort of a hinge moment in all sorts of ways - historically, technologically, socially. It's a moment of great transformation, and I intend to put a story in that moment.' The eyes are wide. 'If you want to live in a city in the world, you may as well live in this one.'</p>",

His New York is the New York of clich\u00e9, with the biggest, tallest and most beautiful of everything. This first time around, he didn't find his New York,a New York special to him. He just recapitulated the New York that has long existed in the British literary mind, the New York of English literature from Fanny Trollope to Martin Amis. As a literary construct, it did not feel new. Rushdie wrote The Ground Beneath Her Feet while living in London and summering in East Hampton. He was just a visitor here. It was before those meandering walks in the park and those nights in nightclubs. As time goes by, he may see a different city, a sister city to Bombay with its polyglot culture and endless, fecund migrations. No one can foresee how the city will act on his imagination. Rushdie, the most imaginative and fractured of English-language novelists, says he is ready for whatever comes. 'I think the moment we're living in is a sort of a hinge moment in all sorts of ways - historically, technologically, socially. It's a moment of great transformation, and I intend to put a story in that moment.' The eyes are wide. 'If you want to live in a city in the world, you may as well live in this one.'",

      "body": "<p>On 5 March this year, Lolo Ferrari finally succeeded in dying, though most of the visitors to the 33,200 Lolo Ferrari websites neither know that nor care. The process of self-destruction had begun long before, when she was Eve Valois, of a good middle-class Breton family. She was 16 and had never been out with a boy when she caught the eye of a 38-year-old used-car dealer who was looking to change his line of business. They were barely married before, Svengali to her Trilby, he put her to work posing for photos de charme, as the French call them, and began designing the new body that would make her a porn superstar. </p> <p>After 22 operations, Lolo Ferrari had a Michael Jackson nose so tiny that she couldn't breathe through it; bulging synthetic cheekbones; a mouth so swollen with collagen that she could hardly form intelligible words; and huge spherical breast implants that weighed 2.8 kilos apiece and compressed her ribcage so much that she was running on one-quarter of her lung capacity. Designing her breast cones had involved complex fleshly engineering which was carried out, as you would expect, by a surgeon who specialises in sex changes. </p> <p>Lolo wanted to be buried under her huge breasts, in a white coffin, wearing her favourite pink ballgown with her teddy bear in her arms. Vigne said he was grief-stricken by her loss, but it will make no material difference to his life. By the time she died at 30 - half-crazy, incapable of leaving her house, living on a diet of cola, cabbage soup and prescription drugs - Lolo 2000 had already generated his stock-in-trade, the image bank that will provide a good income for the rest of his life. </p> <p>The cool post-liberal consensus about pornography misses the point. Pornography has nothing to do with freedom of expression: it is primarily business, a ruthless impersonal industry based on the sound maxims that a) there is one born every minute; and b) you should never give a sucker an even break. It uses and abuses not only the boys and girls who provide the imagery, but also the fantasy-ridden sub-potent public, mostly male, that pays for its product. </p> <p>New guidelines covering both mainstream movies and hard-core videos sold through sex shops mean we can now lawfully watch more pornography. There are virtually no constraints on the level of explicit sex in films now, and in R18 videos, close-up shots of penetration by penis, finger, tongue or sex toy, ejaculation, oral-genital contact and masturbation have become legal. But legal or illegal hardly matters, except that illegal, like all crime, pays better for less work. Can pornography go any further? Yes, it can. Can it go too far? No, it can't. As far as male sexual fantasy is concerned there is no too far. </p> <p>Illicit porn is the trailblazer. Where it goes, legitimate media must follow if they are not to allow the unscrupulous to walk away with the lion's share of the profits, and ultimately the whole business. If cult movies can generate for nothing the kind of media interest that costs mainstream movies millions to pump up, mainstream movies will copy them - slowly, goodness knows, but inevitably. No matter how much froth and bubble there is around the question of what children may and may not be allowed to see, the real problem is what the parent generation demands to be shown. As long as there is demand, the porn industry will be there to serve it. As long as there are cigarettes, kids will smoke them. As long as daddy keeps tit mags and porn videos in his sock drawer, his kids will look at them. The notion that kids can exist in one world while their parents exist in another is a peculiarly English delusion. </p> <p>Historically and etymologically, pornography is simply the advertising of prostitution. It is therefore distinct from obscenity. Obscenity is the depiction of what may not be seen. Some, but by no means all, pornography is obscene; a good deal of obscenity is not in the least pornographic. The spectacle of the hero pulling down his trousers and doing a dump on his next door neighbour's lawn in the Jim Carrey film Me Myself and Irene, released this week, is obscene but not pornographic. Likewise, the sight of his alter ego, the wicked Hank, sucking on one hugely engorged breast protruding from a lactating mother's nursing bra, while her baby feeds at the other, is revolting, but not pornographic - unless you are the kind of guy who cannot get an erection if he is not wearing nappies and being suckled. </p> <p>A great deal of pornography caters for niche markets of just this kind, and is totally unarousing to people whose sexuality has not been kinked in that direction. Minority sexual preferences are usually classed as paraphilias and dubbed abnormal; the permissive society tended to accept paraphilias as an essential aspect of human sexual activity. 'Whatever turns you on' was what you were entitled to in the innocent Sixties, before the lid had been taken off and we had a sight of the can of worms that is human sexuality. What the sex reformers of the Sixties thought they were liberating was people's desire to pleasure each other; what they were not prepared for was the intensity of the need that many people have to hurt each other, and even to harm each other, if they are to get any closer to their own brain-sucking orgasm also known as 'great sex'. </p> <p>The inbuilt problem in the 'whatever turns you on' creed is that what turns one person on does not necessarily turn on his partner. The prostitute who caters to the nappy-wearers might not herself get off on suckling stubbly men, but she was, is, happy to provide the service if, and only if, she is handsomely paid for it. (By the way, 'lolo' is the French baby word for mother's milk.) Very few women develop paraphiliac interests; some say this is because their sexuality is still repressed, and that as they begin to share power and to identify their own sexual interests, they too will begin to demand exotic sexual services. The reality is that most women participate in sex games because there is no other route by which they can enter into what passes for intimacy with the person they love. In the sex industry the customer calls the shots; the purveyor of sexual services, like the purveyor of food or entertainment, like anyone working in any service industry, is in it for the money, but to succeed must give the vivid impression that she really enjoys what she is doing, whether she is sucking a dildo or whipping a stockbroker. Many sex workers find the faking of pleasure a service too far, and draw the line at pretending to enjoy whatever it is the client wants them to do. In an unfree society, most of the activities called consensual represent the capitulation of the powerless to the demands of the powerful. Power comes in various guises, as money, status, patriarchy, and as emotional invulnerability. </p> <p>The purpose of pornography is to arouse desire in the absence of desire, to raise appetite where no hunger exists, so as to provide a market in which the purveyors of pleasure can make their living and their profits. Where need exists, there is no necessity to stimulate demand; where no need exists, enticing imagery must be used to create demand. People who have no desire to eat a piece of bread and butter, because they are not hungry, can be stimulated to desire chocolate if the chocolate is presented to them as something more than food, as ecstasy, rhapsody or orgasm. Chocolate is a fattening comestible marketed as if it were a drug; when foodstuffs from apple pies to processed cheeses are presented as causing euphoria, it is the drug experience that is presented as the way to wellbeing. Commercially produced food is also fake food, not made principally of the substances mentioned on the label, but with chemical analogues and fillers, and laced with taste additives and excessive amounts of salt and sweeteners. Your healthy yoghurt-coated apricot pieces are mostly vegetable fat and sugar, neither of which is mentioned on the label. In a similar way, commercial fast sex is fake sex, divorced from both passion and reproduction. Food advertising sells fantasy food and sex advertising sells fantasy sex. </p> <p>Just as the advertising of fast food and confectionery has eliminated appetite so that no one now knows what it is to work up an appetite, or that hunger is the best sauce to any food, pornography has eliminated desire. Food marketing has brought eating disorders upon us, and it is as likely that sex marketing will have the same consequences. We already gorge and starve on sex, so that love-making becomes displacement activity - fetishistic, obsessive-compulsive and deeply pointless. The analogy with sex and drugs soon became obvious; we began with alcoholics who abuse one kind of drug, and moved to chocoholics who abuse another, and from heroin addicts to sex addicts. </p> <p>There was a time within living memory when for most people, fast food and fast sex were both unattainable. The nation had much less food and much less sex than it has now, but it is very possible that it enjoyed both food and sex more than it does now. Pleasure, like pain, is difficult to quantify; one could never prove that we are having more sex but of poorer quality in 2000 than in 1950, any more than we could prove that potatoes really did taste better 50 years ago, but enjoyment and rarity do seem to be connected in the human psyche, if in a curiously problematic way. An orgasm prolonged for more than a few minutes would soon begin to pall. Routine sex is just that. If you drink champagne once a year, are you more likely to find it delicious than if you drink it every day? Or are you more likely to be disappointed and think that it is not the drink it is cracked up to be? The pleasure principle takes intelligent management; we need to know what to expect from our champagne, how to judge good champagne from bad, and when and where and how fast to drink it. </p> <p>Sex is much more complicated than champagne, especially if two people or more are involved. A wine buff has to learn his pleasure by experiment and also by study; pornography might be thought of as the information system that shows the sex buff how to enjoy sex. There are important differences; the literature of wine cannot give us the sensations of drinking or having drunk; gratification must be delayed. People don't often drink wine while reading about it, and less often find that they need to read about it before working up a desire for it, but people often have sex while watching other people having sex on video. Pornography both triggers a genital reaction, provokes excitement and suggests imminent release; pornography is what makes fast sex possible, alone or with others. </p> <p>Fast food is a way of neutralising hunger and hence the intrusion of images of food into other mental pursuits. Fast sex, too, might clear the decks for a different kind of action. The proliferation of pornography is rather like the rise and rise of the potato crisp, which now occupies both sides of a whole aisle in the local supermarket. You used to have to hunt for a sachet of salt in your crisp packet; you can now get crisps not only ready-seasoned, but with sprayed-on chemicals that simulate the flavours of prawn cocktail, smoky bacon, Worcester sauce, smoked ham and pickle, roast beef and mustard, cream cheese and chives, sour cream and onion, scampi and lemon, and doubtless, one day, altar-boy semen. Crisps are a very good example of food that fattens and does not feed; virtual sex, like virtual food, is designed to leave the consumer unsatisfied. </p> <p>The discussion of what we may and may not see in video and film has nothing to do with pornography, and everything to do with the ever retreating threshold of shockability. The censors take account of what may be routinely seen in other media, and decree that video and cinema may not quite catch up (catching up to the internet would be a lot too much a lot too soon) but can move a little closer to the ever-fluctuating norm. For 70 years or so, the movement has continued in the direction of showing more; what we would expect sooner or later is that the nation's stomach will turn; a tidal wave of revulsion has been known to sweep away all kinds of practices, from dog- and cock-fights, gay bathhouses and sex-aid shops, to burning books, imprisoning deviants, veiling women and shaving men's heads. The Taliban is no new phenomenon; what we should perhaps pray for is a quieter and less cruel revolution, in which people stay away from gross and brutal spectacles simply because they have no stomach for them, and their promoters start losing serious amounts of money. </p> <p>There is absolutely no prospect of this happening that I can see from here. Virtual sex and sexual services go on expanding at an astonishing rate. Lolo Ferrari's specialty, 'big boobs', now occupy more than 880,000 sites on the world wide web, but a search under 'young boys' will net you more than two million matches. Our best hope for a collapse of the whole monstrous business is that the constant pilfering of material from pay-as-you-view sites to be downloaded into free access sites will suck the profits out of pornography. But by that time, pornography will be all the culture we can pretend to. It is already a vastly bigger cultural presence than all our opera, ballet, theatre, music and fine art put together. </p> <p><strong>How porn went mainstream</strong></p> <p><strong> 1917</strong> The newly established British Board of Film Classification lays down 43 categories of material that cannot be portrayed on celluloid. </p> <p><strong> 1959</strong> After a test case of the Obscene Publications Act, Lady Chatterley's Lover is eventually published in the UK 30 years after D.H.

Leaked letters obtained by The Observer reveal that Trevor Phillips, Frank Dobson's running mate in the London mayoral elections, has been told by the Director-General, Greg Dyke, that rules on impartiality make it too dangerous to allow him to continue working for the organisation. Phillips's supporters argue that the Labour peer, Lord Bragg, regularly presents programmes for the BBC and that well-known Conservatives who have worked for the BBC include Michael Portillo, the Shadow Chancellor, and Peter Ainsworth, the Shadow Culture Secretary. The Labour MPs, Austin Mitchell and Ken Livingstone, and former Conservative MP David Mellor have also appeared. It has been pointed out that Phillips was believed to be one of the few regular black broadcasters on Radio 4, where his science programme, Material World, was highly regarded. Friends of Phillips say Dyke's move reveals intense sensitivity about the issue of political bias at the BBC. It has been criticised by the Conservative Party, which accuses it of being anti-Tory and pro-euro. The corporation was also attacked when it was announced that the former Observer commentator, Andrew Marr, who is connected with senior figures in the Labour Party, had been appointed as the BBC's new Political Editor. Dyke himself gave \u00a350,000 to the Labour Party before becoming Director-General. In a series of letters written last June and passed to The Observer by a senior BBC executive, Phillips, who has received three distinguished Royal Television Society awards for his broadcasting work, reveals his own fury at the decision. 'Yes, I am aggrieved. No, I do not understand the problem,' he writes to Dyke. Phillips, who is now the Labour chairman of the Greater London Assembly, was responding to a letter from Dyke in which the Director-General says the broadcaster will no longer present programmes. Dyke says: 'The BBC's first duty is not just to preserve our impartiality but also to be perceived to preserve our impartiality, and that does make it difficult for elected politicians who have fought high-profile election campaigns to combine their political careers with regular presentation commitments.' Responding to a question from Phillips asking if he had been dropped because he was not up to standard, Dyke wrote: 'The reason the BBC did not tell you that the programme [ Material World ] had benefited from your absence, or that you had become a lesser broadcaster than previously, was simply that that was not the case.

The eldest, Fifi Trixibelle, 17, wept as her car drove away. </p> <p>It had been a fittingly star-studded service. The tightest of security was ordered by Geldof and provided by his friend Matthew Freud's public relations firm. </p> <p>The black-suited star ensured that only the 450 named on the guest list could file into the small chapel which backs onto Geldof's home, Davington Priory, a house Yates had loved, where she had spent 13 years of her life but failed to find enduring happiness. </p> <p>Even details of the service were afterwards kept secret, again on orders from Geldof, although the organist and choir from Canterbury Cathedral said a Keats poem was read by family friends and Jools Holland played piano while Bono, lead singer of Irish rock band U2, sang 'Blue Skies'. Holland helped choose the traditional music and had the choir sing 'Ave Maria', 'Jerusalem', music from Faur\u00e9's Requiem, and 'I Vow To Thee My Country'. </p> <p>In the congregation sat many of the famous people, including musicians Annie Lennox, Jasper Conran, Nick Cave, Paul Young, Roger Taylor and Kevin Godley, who had formed Yates's wide circle of friends in life and who had shared the shock of her daughters at her sudden and tragic death. </p> <p>The 41-year-old television presenter was found dead in the bed of her London home a week ago today by Tiger Lily. The cause of death has yet to be established officially, although quantities of alcohol and drugs, including heroin, were found in her bloodstream. </p> <p>It was an untimely end for a woman who was teetotal for much of her life and had been devoted to her children. </p> <p>But the traumas of the last five years of her life had been great: the loss of her lover Michael Hutchence, the bitter custody struggle she lost for her three children by Geldof, and the shattering revelation that the man who fathered her was not Jess Yates but in fact Hughie Green, the late TV game show host. </p> <p>Her estranged mother, Helene Thornton, who Yates said had betrayed her, arrived at the funeral yesterday by taxi. She joined actor Rupert Everett, the DJ Paul Gambaccini, and the media mogul Waheed Alli together with other mourners in Geldof's garden, adjoining the church grounds, where drinks were served by uniformed waitresses after the 50-minute service. </p> <p>Only those closest to her - the children, Geldof and Marine, her friend Belinda Brewin, and a few others, accompanied Paula Yates's body to the crematorium where a five-minute ceremony marked the final farewell for one of Britain's most colourful and vibrant personalities.</p>",

Even details of the service were afterwards kept secret, again on orders from Geldof, although the organist and choir from Canterbury Cathedral said a Keats poem was read by family friends and Jools Holland played piano while Bono, lead singer of Irish rock band U2, sang 'Blue Skies'. Holland helped choose the traditional music and had the choir sing 'Ave Maria', 'Jerusalem', music from Faur\u00e9's Requiem, and 'I Vow To Thee My Country'. In the congregation sat many of the famous people, including musicians Annie Lennox, Jasper Conran, Nick Cave, Paul Young, Roger Taylor and Kevin Godley, who had formed Yates's wide circle of friends in life and who had shared the shock of her daughters at her sudden and tragic death. The 41-year-old television presenter was found dead in the bed of her London home a week ago today by Tiger Lily. The cause of death has yet to be established officially, although quantities of alcohol and drugs, including heroin, were found in her bloodstream. It was an untimely end for a woman who was teetotal for much of her life and had been devoted to her children. But the traumas of the last five years of her life had been great: the loss of her lover Michael Hutchence, the bitter custody struggle she lost for her three children by Geldof, and the shattering revelation that the man who fathered her was not Jess Yates but in fact Hughie Green, the late TV game show host. Her estranged mother, Helene Thornton, who Yates said had betrayed her, arrived at the funeral yesterday by taxi. She joined actor Rupert Everett, the DJ Paul Gambaccini, and the media mogul Waheed Alli together with other mourners in Geldof's garden, adjoining the church grounds, where drinks were served by uniformed waitresses after the 50-minute service. Only those closest to her - the children, Geldof and Marine, her friend Belinda Brewin, and a few others, accompanied Paula Yates's body to the crematorium where a five-minute ceremony marked the final farewell for one of Britain's most colourful and vibrant personalities.",
