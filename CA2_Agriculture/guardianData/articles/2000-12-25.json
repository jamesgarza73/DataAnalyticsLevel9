This year's Royal Christmas Day broadcast, expressing the personal thoughts of the Queen, was devoted to a religious theme. Adopting the role of a lay preacher, the Queen said: \"To many of us our beliefs are of fundamental importance. For me the teachings of Christ and my own personal accountability before God provide a framework in which I try to lead my life.\" She told a worldwide television, radio and internet audience: \"I, like so many of you, have drawn great comfort in difficult times from Christ's words and example.\" The Queen also spoke of the life of Jesus, the carpenter and preacher who was crucified, commenting: \"Christmas is the traditional, if not the actual, birthday of a man who was destined to change the course of our history. \"And today we are celebrating the fact that Jesus Christ was born 2000 years ago; this the true Millennium anniversary. His death might have been the end of the story, but then came the resurrection and with it the foundation of the Christian faith.\" It was primarily a Christian message but the Queen also mentioned the teachings of other great faiths and recognised that some people did not believe in God. The Queen spoke of spirituality in the teachings of religions other than Christianity and among non-believers despite a materialistic world. \"Of course religion can be divisive, but the Bible, the Koran and the sacred texts of the Jews and Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs, are all sources of divine inspiration and practical guidance passed down through the generations,\" she explained. The Queen's address, which was recorded in the Belgium Suite at the Palace on Friday, was broadcast for the first time this year via the official royal website as well as on television and radio.

Some 45 people were injured. Meanwhile, in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir - the Himalayan territory disputed between India and Pakistan - a car bomb went off outside army headquarters Monday, killing six people and wounding 23 others. India blamed Islamic militants for the attack. A Pakistan-based rebel group called the Jamaat-ul Mujahedeen claimed responsibility for the Kashmir explosion in telephone calls to local newspapers. In Pakistan, the first bomb ripped through a crowded market in the eastern border city of Lahore, injuring 36 people, while the second bomb exploded at a railway station in Faisalabad, also in eastern Punjab province, wounding three people, they said. Six people were injured in an explosion on a passenger bus in Hyderabad in the southern Sindh province. A blast in Kharian, 70 miles north of Lahore, did not cause any injuries. No group claimed responsibility for any of the blasts, but Pakistani police accused arch rival India of seeking retaliation for last weekend's attack on India's historic Red Fort in the heart of its capital, New Delhi. Islamic militants from the Pakistani-based Lashkar-e-Tayyaba took responsibility for the Red Fort attack that killed three people, including two soldiers. \"We were expecting Indian-sponsored terrorist activities after mujahedeen (holy warriors) hit New Delhi's Red Fort,\" Malik Asif Hayyat, inspector general of the Punjab police said. There was no immediate reaction from India to the accusations. The explosion in Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab, caused a fire that destroyed several stalls and shattered glass in nearby buildings in Lunda Bazaar, located near the congested Delhi Gate neighborhood, police stated. The bomb was apparently left in a shopping bag near stalls selling used clothing. The explosion triggered a stampede as fire and smoke billowed from the stores.

The hills in north-east Wales also had a white Christmas.\" Thirty-two swimmers braved the icy waters of Weymouth harbour for the town's annual Christmas Day dip this morning. Despite strong winds, rain and temperatures hovering near freezing point, most took the plunge for the 200-yard race wearing only their swimming suits, although a few less foolhardy souls pulled on wetsuits. The competitors ranged from a nine-years-old boy to three men in their 50s. The event, now in its 52nd year, was watched by around 200 spectators. This year's winner was Jack Wiltshire. Event organiser Mark Lockie from the Weymouth Lions Club said competitor numbers were up on the year before. He added: \"I have no idea why anyone would want to take part. I have been trying to figure it out for some time. A Briton attempting to break a world record was today spending Christmas - and his 179th day - alone on a rowing boat in the Pacific Ocean. Jim Shekdhar, 54, originally of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, will have to forego the traditional roast turkey after the cooking stove on board his craft packed in. After setting sail from Ilo, Peru, in June, the computer sales director is more than 3,000 miles from his destination - Sydney - and due to strong winds has not made any progress for three weeks. But if he reaches the Australian city without help, Mr Shekdhar, who is keeping friends and family up to date on his voyage via his website www.pacific-challenge-2000.com, will become the first person to row the Pacific non-stop and unsupported. Mr Shekdhar, who rowed the Atlantic Ocean with partner David Jackson in 65 days, emigrated to Australia in 1971 and then New Zealand in 1980. A woman prison officer was today recovering after being taken hostage by an inmate and held for more than 42 hours, prison service officials said. The officer was held by the male prisoner, who has not been named, shortly after 2pm on Saturday at HMP Garth, near Leyland, Lancashire. A Prison Service spokesman said officials monitored the situation over the weekend at the Category B prison and a decision was taken to intervene at 8am today. No-one was injured during the operation in which the woman was freed, he added. Lancashire Police have launched an investigation and it is understood the inmate was being transferred to another institution.",

      "bodyText": "The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, today compared the problems created by Britain's influx of asylum-seekers with events surrounding the nativity. Dr Carey drew the parallel as he delivered his Christmas Day sermon at Canterbury Cathedral. He told worshippers that the nativity was an enduring example of the problems encountered by people as they arrived in an unwelcoming place, often because their hosts were fearful. Dr Carey said: \"It is a familiar story repeated over and over again in history. \"When people are afraid, generosity is in short supply.\" But the archbishop also reserved special praise for those who have managed to retain a friendly welcome for desperate asylum seekers arriving in the UK. He said: \"As hundreds of asylum-seekers pour through Dover weekly, local people find it difficult to reconcile the duty of hospitality, which has been so characteristic of our nation for many years, with the prospect of finite resources being over-burdened by the sheer numbers of new arrivals. \"It is to the credit of the people of the ports of east Kent that resentment has not totally blocked the spirit of human kindness and hospitality.\" The remainder of his sermon concentrated on the conflict between human nature in wanting to help strangers versus the power of the \"not-in-my-backyard\" culture.
