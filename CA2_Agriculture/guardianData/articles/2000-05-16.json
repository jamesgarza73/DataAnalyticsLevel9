The person who did the job before him thrived on pressure, and it's easy to link a position with the way the person who's leaving handles it. The next time, I identified key elements of the job and found someone more suitable. Richard Hunter, 32 financial services director Network constantly. If you start looking when a vacancy arises, chances are you won't find anyone in time. When I meet someone who impresses me at an industry dinner or conference, I sound them out. Often you can interview someone informally without them realising it - they're more relaxed and often more honest. When I was last recruiting, I had four or five people already in mind. I took them out for a drink and asked them to post me their CVs. Then I began the formal interview procedure. Interviews by Cayte Williams",

Only when I frisbeed it at the doorframe did it make contact with my roommate, who was just entering the room. Sadly, it had developed a side seam by then and disgorged some of its contents on to his trousers. I switched to the springier, greener second banana. My roommate did the throwing, but still no bounce. I rang Dave's solicitor. Me: I've been looking at the merits of Dave's case. Solicitor: Have you been bouncing bananas too? Me: Yeah. They don't, do they? Solicitor: No, but Dave wants to come in and prove that they do. I can't talk them out of it. Dave's union seem perfectly happy to pay for him to come and bounce bananas in chambers. And I know what will happen. When we've all failed to bounce a variety of bananas off a variety of surfaces, I'll turn to Dave and explain why his case is not very strong. And he'll say: Fair enough.",

According to this week's Mirror, a recent work \"away weekend\" for 18 employees from Railtrack descended into inebriated misbehaviour: after drinking for most of the evening, the group from the company's London headquarters is said to have become rowdy and abusive over dinner, demanded that the hotel pool be opened at 1.30am and frolicked noisily in the jacuzzi before retiring to bed. </p> <p>The next day they were up bright and early for a treasure hunt-style bicycle ride, but the damage was done. Unfortunately for the Railtrack staff, some reporters from the Mirror had been staying in the hotel at the same time. The \"Railtrack bosses' drunken rampage\" - which even more unfortunately had coincided with day two of the Paddington disaster inquiry - was splashed across the paper's front page on Monday. \"The behaviour was utterly outrageous and completely against company policy,\" thundered Railtrack's chief executive. \"We cannot tolerate this kind of thing.\" Paul White, the company's national contracts manager, has been suspended, and the company is conducting an internal inquiry, vowing to sack everyone involved if the allegations are found to be correct. Talk about thumping hangovers. </p> <p>If it is indeed the case that White and his colleagues were disorderly, as has been claimed, they may still be justified in feeling somewhat aggrieved. Because the fact is that many companies do indeed tolerate \"this kind of thing\". A great number, in fact, might be said to actively encourage it. Indeed, as drunken excesses at corporate weekends go, this behaviour is relatively tame. </p> <p>Alison, 25, certainly witnessed far more raucous antics at her previous job in a media firm. \"The company went on a conference to an extremely expensive hotel and took some clients, and it was completely mad. We spent tens of thousands of pounds in the bar in one night and made the staff keep serving till dawn, even though they wanted to go to bed. I have been to industry dos where people have been dancing topless on the bar in front of clients they were doing million-pound deals with.\" She says the tales she could tell of drink and drugs intake, and illicit inter-colleague sex in corridors and cupboards, are hardly secrets. The company's managing directors were well aware of what was going on - several of them were the worst offenders. </p> <p>All well and good, one supposes, if your boss doesn't mind. But while the issue of drunken behaviour - inside or outside work - may not particularly trouble many employers and staff, employment rights experts suggest that it should. Certainly companies are wrong to believe they can blithely offer lavish hospitality and a free bar only to hastily wash their hands of the matter when staff get a little the worse for wear. One of the most notorious incidents of drunken work behaviour occurred, of all places, during a piss-up in a brewery. Three workers from Whitbread were fired for throwing beer and punches after - in another ironic twist - a seminar on behavioural skills. But in 1996 the court of appeal ruled that the three had been unfairly dismissed. Its decision was based largely on the fact that the incident had taken place out of work hours, but the judge also ruled that the company had to take some responsibility for the incident since it had laid on the free bar. The workers were awarded \u00a32,000 each in compensation. </p> <p>\"It is crucial that companies have in place some guidelines on this kind of occurrence,\" says Tricia Jackson, a training and personnel consultant, and author of a book on drugs and alcohol policies at work. \"They need to think everything through. Are there practical rules for off-site events? Quite often a company will have a blanket drugs and alcohol policy but will not have thought about the situation outside work. When employees are in their own time it becomes difficult.\" </p> <p>The law on this subject, says Jackson, is \"tricky\". \"On a training event, is someone working when they are sitting at the bar at 7pm or not? Can you object to someone's behaviour outside company time? It has been successfully argued that some employers have fairly dismissed staff for behaviour outside work that brought the company into disrepute. But it's ever so complex.\" </p> <p>Certainly it seems that misbehaviour from staff who are supposedly \"bonding\" is an issue that employers will need to take seriously. A survey last year of 114 luxury hotels found that complaints about bad behaviour during corporate events had risen by 30% in the previous year. \"Some executives are still drunk when morning sessions begin,\" noted the report from conference organisers Banks Sadler. \"Other delegates tend to be marked out by their sexual harassment of staff, for leaving drink stains and food trodden into carpets and furnishings, and for 'talking down' to staff to make themselves feel good in front of colleagues. A minority of delegates refuse to acknowledge house rules or civilised behaviour and think they can get away with everything.\" </p> <p>It is perhaps this arrogance that is most offensive. Staff who may be perfectly charming in their own office uncharacteristically begin to throw their weight around, intoxicated by the amount of money their party is about to spend, and according to the manager of one prestigious London hotel, it is women who are the worst. \"They can be far more strident and unreasonable than men,\" he says. \"We know the type. They waltz in like a film star and demand everyone rushes around after them. It is quite obvious they are after something for nothing, such as an upgrading, but they are never quite satisfied.\" The Banks Sadler report has no doubt where the blame lies. \"It is very much a consequence of the open-account bar system.\" </p> <p>\"It's easier to police a total ban on alcohol,\" says Jackson, \"but that is rarely practical and it isn't going to solve the problems either. It is argued that socialising can help people start to network and can help team-building. There's a lot to be said for relaxing with colleagues.\" </p> <p>Jackson admits she doesn't have a single answer, but stresses that companies must avoid sending mixed messages on drunken behaviour. \"In the Whitbread case, the employer providing the free bar all evening went seriously against them. In any disciplinary case the company has to show that they are consistently applying the rules. It's about making sure you don't impose rulings for employees on the shop floor when senior management have a long-lunch culture and whisky in the boardroom.\" </p> <p>In some firms, however, life is blissfully uncomplicated. In November a group of 11 traders on a corporate weekend at a country house hotel caused \u00a320,000 worth of damage after going on what was described as a \"wrecking spree\". The traders, from a London finance firm, drank 20 bottles of vintage wine at \u00a380 a pop, then allegedly played cricket in the dining room, ripped lights off the walls and smashed a Victorian chair and coffee table, which were piled on to a log fire in the lounge.

      "bodyText": "The government-backed review of the pension fund industry, which identified \"systemic herd behaviour\" in the City investors, will be put to 25 major investors from the US and Europe by Gordon Brown today. A the breakfast meeting at 11 Downing Street, the chancellor will have his first opportunity to pose the almost 50 questions raised by Paul Myners, the head of the Gartmore fund management group and chairman of Guardian Media Group, who is heading the investigation at the heart of the chancellor's aim to boost productivity in the economy. As he published the consultation paper on institutional investment yesterday, Mr Myners, who will also attend the meeting, said he wanted to get behind the apparent \"consensual way\" pension funds and other major assets were invested. Aware of potential criticism for bias in his review, Mr Myners, as head of the UK's largest fund management group, insisted that he was approaching the investigation with an open mind. He admitted that he had harboured personal concerns about the multi-billion pound industry for some time. \"I have been concerned for some time that we are not making the best possible use of our capital markets,\" Mr Myners said. Among his concerns were whether British fund managers were \"too prone to invest in established companies, rather than high risk start-ups\". His review, the consultation period of which runs until July 14, follows on from the Don Cruickshank investigation into the banking industry that led to a full-scale competition commission inquiry into banking to small and medium sized businesses. While the Cruickshank review scrutinised the way money was lent to small business, the Myners investigation will analyse the way fund managers make equity investments into such businesses. Mr Myners admitted that the terms of the investigation, which he intends to conclude in time for the Budget next March, were wide-reaching and insisted that all the issues were as important as each other. He is calling for responses from all sectors of the industry, including individual pension fund trustees, pensioners and people looking for finance from investment managers, on a diverse range of issues. These include matters such as why there appears to be a reluctance to invest in venture capital to whether the benchmarks used to measure pension fund performance hinder a long-term view of investment. In the 20-page consultant paper, available on the internet, Mr Myners said he shared the chancellor's concerns that there may be problems with the industry and that there may be factors encouraging institutional investors to follow standard investment patterns. He said that, while it was not the government's rule to second-guess investment decisions, if there were structural or regulatory reasons why the industry was behaving in a certain manner then the government may have a role to play in removing any distortions. \u0095 The financial services authority yesterday gave warning that paying into a personal pension, even with the tax breaks they enjoy, is no better in the long run than taking out an individual savings account, because of steep charges on pension schemes. Fundamental questions 1 We have a large pool of long-term capital but do we invest it with a sufficiently long-term view? 2 Have we as an industry become too risk-averse, concerned more about the risk of underperformance versus some benchmark rather than the rewards of outperformance? 3 Are we too prone to invest in established companies, rather than higher risk start-ups? 4 Is the growth of indexation exacerbating a bias towards companies with large market capitalisations? 5 Do major institutions follow investment patterns that are too standard, seeking safety in numbers rather than pioneering radically different investment strategies?",

It is a jungle out there all right, but strictly of the blackboard variety. </p> <p>Lloyd re-introduces all the figures familiar from our schooldays: the nerdy outcast, the golden boy gone bad, the non-conformist, the lad whose bad behaviour satisfies a craving for attention. Indeed the reader must conclude that, if discipline on and off the field is ever to be properly enforced, the England and Wales Cricket Board should drop the current system of financial penalties in favour of the offending player being forced to stay behind after matches and empty the litterbins. </p> <p>According to Lloyd, Graham Thorpe is the class rebel. Cricket has a long association with rebelliousness, of course. It began in 1850 when Garibaldi and his Thousand were skittled out for 43 by Alfred Mynn and \"ten gentlemen of Kent\" and reached its apotheosis in the late-1960s when Scarborough Festival welcomed a TN Pearce's XI which included Patrice Lamumba and Abbie Hoffman (Ulrike Meinhoff was scheduled to keep wicket but on, discovering she was a lady, the skipper Roy Virgin sensibly instructed her to \"seize the means of production\" (ie two sliced loaves, half-a-dozen eggs and a bottle of salad cream) and make the teas instead. Even today the selectors demonstrate their adherence to the Berlin situationist school of absurdist anarchy by sometimes picking Ian Salisbury. </p> <p>Sadly, it appears that Lloyd believes Thorpe is no theoretician, unlikely to rouse the masses with assertions that \"change will come from the barrel of a Gunn and Moore\", but more the angst-riddled Mickey Rourke-type to be found in sixth form common rooms. Perhaps this is not so surprising. After all his nickname, \"Thorpie\", fairly shimmers with uncontrolled rage at the unfairness of it all. </p> <p>As an example of the Surrey left-hander's seditious behaviour Lloyd cites the time during a tour of the West Indies when he appeared at an official reception aboard John Paul Getty's yacht wearing jeans. To some this may appear trivial but Lloyd knows what boys are like. Where Thorpe leads, impressionable juniors will follow. Civilisation is only a veneer. Left to their own devices beneath the palm trees, it is a potential Lord of the Flies scenario: one minute non-regulation trousers, the next loincloths, war paint and the ritual slaughter of the fat lad using pointy sticks. No wonder John Crawley never looked comfortable in an England cap. </p> <p>Poor Andy Caddick, meanwhile, is regarded as a nerd by the more popular boys. Lloyd suspects this is because he moved in different social circles and was not au fait with the clique's in-jokes and expressions. I bet his Mum bought him the wrong sort of trainers too. </p> <p> Lloyd is a shrewd and acerbic observer, though he does make one lapse of judgment, in my view, when dealing with The Head Boy Who Let Down The Whole School, Adam Hollioake. Apparently the Surrey skipper once stopped his car in Hampshire to yell abuse at players in a village match. </p> <p>Lloyd sees this as a breach of discipline. Personally I feel it shows a commendable concern with standards at the game's grass roots on the part of the dashing all-rounder. Indeed Hollioake's example should be taken up by more of his colleagues. </p> <p>We are always told that club cricket in this country needs a tougher edge. What is more likely to provide it than the thought that some giant of the world game like Peter Such might pull his sponsored Renault Laguna on to the grass verge and yell \"Have you never heard of the long-barrier position, lardarse?\" at the fine-leg?</p>",

Sadly, it appears that Lloyd believes Thorpe is no theoretician, unlikely to rouse the masses with assertions that \"change will come from the barrel of a Gunn and Moore\", but more the angst-riddled Mickey Rourke-type to be found in sixth form common rooms. Perhaps this is not so surprising. After all his nickname, \"Thorpie\", fairly shimmers with uncontrolled rage at the unfairness of it all. As an example of the Surrey left-hander's seditious behaviour Lloyd cites the time during a tour of the West Indies when he appeared at an official reception aboard John Paul Getty's yacht wearing jeans. To some this may appear trivial but Lloyd knows what boys are like. Where Thorpe leads, impressionable juniors will follow. Civilisation is only a veneer. Left to their own devices beneath the palm trees, it is a potential Lord of the Flies scenario: one minute non-regulation trousers, the next loincloths, war paint and the ritual slaughter of the fat lad using pointy sticks. No wonder John Crawley never looked comfortable in an England cap. Poor Andy Caddick, meanwhile, is regarded as a nerd by the more popular boys. Lloyd suspects this is because he moved in different social circles and was not au fait with the clique's in-jokes and expressions. I bet his Mum bought him the wrong sort of trainers too. Lloyd is a shrewd and acerbic observer, though he does make one lapse of judgment, in my view, when dealing with The Head Boy Who Let Down The Whole School, Adam Hollioake. Apparently the Surrey skipper once stopped his car in Hampshire to yell abuse at players in a village match. Lloyd sees this as a breach of discipline. Personally I feel it shows a commendable concern with standards at the game's grass roots on the part of the dashing all-rounder. Indeed Hollioake's example should be taken up by more of his colleagues. We are always told that club cricket in this country needs a tougher edge. What is more likely to provide it than the thought that some giant of the world game like Peter Such might pull his sponsored Renault Laguna on to the grass verge and yell \"Have you never heard of the long-barrier position, lardarse?\" at the fine-leg?",

But even if the Church is crying sacrilege he still has some way to go before moving in the same mysterious ways as the previous incumbent of Manchester United's No7 jersey. An eight-foot, luridly coloured Cantona (or Le Dieu, as the Gallic genius may prefer to be known) sparked an unholy row at Manchester's City Art Gallery in Michael Browne's interpretation of Piero della Francesca's Resurrection of Christ and Andrea Mantegna's Julius Caesar on his Triumphal Chariot.

      "body": "<p>Fans arriving in Copenhagen for tomorrow's Uefa Cup final will be faced with the biggest football-security operation Denmark has ever mounted amid growing fears of trouble between Turkish and English fans. </p> <p>Almost 20% of the Danish police force will be on duty for the Galatasaray v Arsenal match and a team of Turkish magistrates has already flown into the capital to deal with potential troublemakers from their own country. </p> <p>As many as 2,000 police officers will be on duty and will be working closely with their west Yorkshire and Turkish counterparts, who will be in the city to help identify known troublemakers. Dozens of plain-clothes officers will also be mingling with the crowds. </p> <p>Around 24,000 Turkish and English fans are expected in the city while another 9,000 tickets went on general sale before it was known who had qualified for the final. </p> <p>It is believed that the majority of them have found their way on to the black market, with Turks in particular paying high prices for them, raising concerns over segregation in the Parken stadium. </p> <p>A Turkish anti-terrorism squad is also travelling with the Galatasaray team due to fears that players might be threatened in the run-up to the match. All the hotels used by players and officials, and the stadium itself, will be checked out by sniffer dogs at least twice before the match kicks off. </p> <p>Danish authorities have already warned fans that they will not tolerate trouble and stated that those arrested will be immediately deported.

      "bodyText": "Fans arriving in Copenhagen for tomorrow's Uefa Cup final will be faced with the biggest football-security operation Denmark has ever mounted amid growing fears of trouble between Turkish and English fans. Almost 20% of the Danish police force will be on duty for the Galatasaray v Arsenal match and a team of Turkish magistrates has already flown into the capital to deal with potential troublemakers from their own country. As many as 2,000 police officers will be on duty and will be working closely with their west Yorkshire and Turkish counterparts, who will be in the city to help identify known troublemakers. Dozens of plain-clothes officers will also be mingling with the crowds. Around 24,000 Turkish and English fans are expected in the city while another 9,000 tickets went on general sale before it was known who had qualified for the final. It is believed that the majority of them have found their way on to the black market, with Turks in particular paying high prices for them, raising concerns over segregation in the Parken stadium. A Turkish anti-terrorism squad is also travelling with the Galatasaray team due to fears that players might be threatened in the run-up to the match. All the hotels used by players and officials, and the stadium itself, will be checked out by sniffer dogs at least twice before the match kicks off. Danish authorities have already warned fans that they will not tolerate trouble and stated that those arrested will be immediately deported. However, police have decided not to close bars in the city, where the bulk of the fans are expected to arrive tomorrow. Fears of violence have increased following the death of two Leeds United fans on the eve of the semi-final first leg in Istanbul last month. Danish police say they have received intelligence reports that Leeds fans are planning to attend the final to attack Galatasaray fans, and police in London said last week that they know of Arsenal troublemakers planning to travel to Copenhagen. Police patrols in the centre of the capital have already been stepped up. A special fence is also being erected at the stadium to keep rival fans apart. The past few days have also seen an increase in threats posted on the internet against Galatasaray supporters, although British police are quick to point out that they consider many of them to be mere bravado. Mogens Lauridsen, the Copenhagen police chief who is in charge of the security operation, said: \"We can't keep the two teams' fans apart all the time but we're intensifying patrolling in areas with pubs and restaurants. We'll have people everywhere.\" The British government, meanwhile, has warned English fans that anyone identified causing trouble at Euro 2000 next month will be banned from following any English club's matches in Europe for 10 years. \"This ban is the harshest punishment handed out to English football fans; we will not tolerate any misbehaviour,\" said Lord Bassam, the Home Office minister with a brief for football hooliganism. \u0095 Jose Antonio Lopez Nieto of Spain will referee tomorrow's Uefa Cup final.

Not that his journey was really necessary, Fowler having been left out following a bust-up with Liverpool's manager G\u00e9rard Houllier. </p> <p>So now Fowler will have to prove his current fitness in training next week when England begin preparations for the warm-up matches against Brazil, Ukraine and Malta. Then, and only then, will Keegan decide if it is worthwhile playing the Liverpool striker against Brazil or Ukraine, after which the England coach will reduce by six the squad of 28 he announced yesterday. </p> <p>\"Robbie's general fitness may be OK,\" Keegan said, \"but his match fitness is something else. I've got to see him in a training session to find out if he is sharp enough to play in a major tournament. If I think it's right to put him in, then I'll put him in. </p> <p>\"If I do pick him then I've got to leave out one of my other five strikers. It's up to Robbie to give me that problem.\" It is assumed that the fifth striker's place lies between Fowler and Manchester United's Andy Cole, although Keegan was at pains yesterday to cast doubt on this theory. </p> <p>\"Whoever I leave out I'm going to be hammered,\" the England coach observed gloomily. \"It's just a question of how I get hammered. That's part of the job.\" True enough, although Keegan will only discover just how punitive the media's anvil can be once Euro 2000 is under way. </p> <p>Not that the Fowler-Cole debate is entirely relevant to the sort of difficulties England are likely to face in their first-round group games with Portugal, Germany and Romania, countries against whom they have won only four times in a total of 18 European Championship or World Cup encounters. Neither striker has so far come remotely close to reproducing his club form in internationals and of the two Fowler alone has scored for England. </p> <p>Keegan is likely to encounter more problems in midfield and at full-back. The inclusion of Jamie Redknapp, recently recovered from a knee injury, as a possible alternative to Dennis Wise, hardly makes the heart pound with anticipation, and while there might be a case for taking Nick Barmby as a cover on the left Ray Parlour, Arsenal's serving man, does not really come into the argument. </p> <p>The situation at full-back will still be dire even if Kieron Dyer makes the Euro 2000 squad. That an England squad of 28 should include only two specialists in these positions, and one of those, Phil Neville, is a right-footed left-back, shows how thin the nation is in the type of footballers who once queued up for caps. </p> <p>It is hard to believe that Keegan will not take Gary Neville although yesterday he did remark that \"to ask certain people to play slightly out of their normal position is not a problem for us\". This, and a later observation that Steven Gerrard, the Liverpool 19-year-old who seems assured of a squad place, could play at right-back as well as midfield, did little to allay suspicions that the older Neville may be left behind. Yet, if Keegan is going to leave a defender out then surely it should be the superfluous centre-back Rio Ferdinand. </p> <p>At this distance the idea of using Gerrard at right-back looks like theory running ahead of reason. Dyer would be a better bet although he, like Gerrard, is happiest in midfield. Keegan laughed off the idea of every member of the team being able to play in his favourite position but there are limits to the number of people you can move around. </p> <p>This squad is worthy but unremarkable and Fowler is not the only player whose fitness is in doubt. Martin Keown, Tony Adams, Michael Owen, Gary Neville and Redknapp have all had recent problems. Ron Greenwood, Bobby Robson and Graham Taylor, among Keegan's England predecessors, have all suffered through losing key players to injuries suffered just before or during major tournaments. </p> <p>Reasonably strong in goal, at centre-back and up front and able to call on players of genuinely high quality in David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Owen, Adams and, if he can shed some years, Alan Shearer, England should make satisfactory progress this summer provided they are able to get off to a sound start against Portugal. </p> <p>The downside is that if Keegan wants to play with four at the back his choice is already restricted and if he does not take Gary Neville he could find himself forced to use the 3-5-2 formation exposed by Romania in Toulouse in the last World Cup. The bigger the tournament the more ill-fitting your square pegs are likely to be.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\"I don't want to appear callous,\" Duncan Fletcher says with the voice of a man who has mastered the neutral tone of the sporting professional, \"but there won't be room for emotion. Events unfolding 6,000 miles away can have no real bearing on my own job. I just want us to go out and win every game we play. The fact that the opposition happens to be Zimbabwean is, for the most part, incidental.\" </p> <p>That mild qualification of \"for the most part\" may hold the key to both the success of the disarmingly unobtrusive Fletcher and the outcome of test cricket's basement scrap between England and Zimbabwe, which begins on Thursday at Lord's. </p> <p>In his seemingly delicate position as a Zimbabwean now coaching England in his first home series against his troubled country of origin, Fletcher is notably stoical. Yet he is too shrewd a strategist not to make the most of his intimate knowledge of the vulnerable Zimbabweans - a team whose primary virtues of boundless optimism and spirit have been blunted by the political crisis engulfing their country. </p> <p>The Zimbabweans themselves are without illusion when reflecting on Fletcher's significance. When six members of the visiting squad are asked to name the man they fear most in English cricket, five point to Fletcher. The sixth, Zimbabwe's own coach Andy Pycroft, initially highlights the threat of Andy Caddick and Darren Gough. But he soon provides a more telling insight into Fletcher's potentially crucial impact. </p> <p>\"I know him very well,\" Pycroft confirms. \"He was Zimbabwe's captain when I played and I eventually succeeded him. Duncan is always very astute when analysing opponents and identifying their weaknesses. And he obviously knows the Zimbabwean character and temperament inside out. He understands better than anyone what gets us going and what brings us down.\" </p> <p>Fletcher defines the Zimbabwean cricketing psyche as being based on \"the determination to keep grinding away. They've got some very effective cricketers who niggle away in the hope that you'll lose patience and make a mistake. They bowl relentless line and length, believing that you will eventually crumble. It's my job to ensure England keep their concentration. That task will keep my emotions in check.\" </p> <p>Yet Fletcher admits to more turbulent feelings when he accepted the apparently poisoned position of England coach. He remembers his trepidation in the build-up to last winter's tour of South Africa. </p> <p>\"I had a lot of reservations and was told repeatedly: 'Duncan, be very careful when you walk into that [England] dressing-room. It won't be like a Western Province or Glamorgan dressing-room where there is an overwhelming sense of fun and camaraderie. The England atmosphere is sour and negative.' I didn't know any of the players and so I was very worried.\" </p> <p>England's early disasters in Johannesburg mirrored Fletcher's apprehension with traumatic effect. \"We faced our nightmare scenario in the first test,\" he says. \"Two runs on the board, four men in the pavilion. I sat there thinking: 'Hell, this cannot be happening.' I couldn't imagine a worse start to my career as a test coach. </p> <p>\"We took an almighty knock and the press were aggressive. The guys, however, held their heads high and I did my best to encourage them by creating this bubble where we'd work hard but, most of all, enjoy each other's company. Before I came into the job I was described as a disciplinarian. Yet every team I've coached has, more than anything, enjoyed themselves. </p> <p>\"I was delighted to discover a great bunch of guys. The England dressing-room was as happy as any I'd known. For me that was the most heartening aspect of the whole tour.\" </p> <p>England's final test victory in rainy Pretoria, when Hansie Cronje engineered a result, has been tainted by the betting scandal which Fletcher says \"rocked me as much as anyone. It made me wonder where cricket could go after such a devastating revelation. </p> <p>\"But I don't believe Cronje threw that match. The South Africans were really annoyed that they'd lost to us. They're either the greatest actors in the world or we simply beat them by reaching a challenging total of 250 in 70 overs.\" </p> <p>Fletcher believes this summer's series against Zimbabwe and West Indies present an ideal opportunity for England to mount a recovery. \"We lack Australia's depth,\" he admits, \"but we have a chance to get the team into decent shape. There's still a lot wrong with the English game but we have a group of players who are going somewhere. </p> <p>\"Nasser Hussain deserves a lot of praise. I just like the guy. He's a good captain who knows what he wants. I've always said the captain is the manager of the shop and the coach is his chief consultant. We work very well together.\" </p> <p>England's Zimbabwean consultant will have a former compatriot uppermost in mind when he offers a \"quiet word of advice\" to each of the players this week. Graeme Hick's perennial \"comeback\" resumes on Thursday. </p> <p>Fletcher, who knew Hick when he was showing Bradmanesque potential as a Zimbabwean teenager, is convinced that a lasting resurrection is possible for a player whose commitment and temperament have since been questionable. </p> <p>\"We need more senior pros,\" Fletcher emphasises, \"to support Hussain, Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart. There's no doubt that Graeme Hick is a great batter who could be at the core of our team. I still think he can finally deliver true quality at test level. They certainly rate Hick in Zimbabwe. It's time for him to earn that same respect in this country.\"</p>",

The sixth, Zimbabwe's own coach Andy Pycroft, initially highlights the threat of Andy Caddick and Darren Gough. But he soon provides a more telling insight into Fletcher's potentially crucial impact. \"I know him very well,\" Pycroft confirms. \"He was Zimbabwe's captain when I played and I eventually succeeded him. Duncan is always very astute when analysing opponents and identifying their weaknesses. And he obviously knows the Zimbabwean character and temperament inside out. He understands better than anyone what gets us going and what brings us down.\" Fletcher defines the Zimbabwean cricketing psyche as being based on \"the determination to keep grinding away. They've got some very effective cricketers who niggle away in the hope that you'll lose patience and make a mistake. They bowl relentless line and length, believing that you will eventually crumble. It's my job to ensure England keep their concentration. That task will keep my emotions in check.\" Yet Fletcher admits to more turbulent feelings when he accepted the apparently poisoned position of England coach. He remembers his trepidation in the build-up to last winter's tour of South Africa. \"I had a lot of reservations and was told repeatedly: 'Duncan, be very careful when you walk into that [England] dressing-room. It won't be like a Western Province or Glamorgan dressing-room where there is an overwhelming sense of fun and camaraderie. The England atmosphere is sour and negative.' I didn't know any of the players and so I was very worried.\" England's early disasters in Johannesburg mirrored Fletcher's apprehension with traumatic effect. \"We faced our nightmare scenario in the first test,\" he says. \"Two runs on the board, four men in the pavilion. I sat there thinking: 'Hell, this cannot be happening.' I couldn't imagine a worse start to my career as a test coach. \"We took an almighty knock and the press were aggressive. The guys, however, held their heads high and I did my best to encourage them by creating this bubble where we'd work hard but, most of all, enjoy each other's company. Before I came into the job I was described as a disciplinarian. Yet every team I've coached has, more than anything, enjoyed themselves. \"I was delighted to discover a great bunch of guys. The England dressing-room was as happy as any I'd known. For me that was the most heartening aspect of the whole tour.\" England's final test victory in rainy Pretoria, when Hansie Cronje engineered a result, has been tainted by the betting scandal which Fletcher says \"rocked me as much as anyone. It made me wonder where cricket could go after such a devastating revelation. \"But I don't believe Cronje threw that match. The South Africans were really annoyed that they'd lost to us. They're either the greatest actors in the world or we simply beat them by reaching a challenging total of 250 in 70 overs.\" Fletcher believes this summer's series against Zimbabwe and West Indies present an ideal opportunity for England to mount a recovery. \"We lack Australia's depth,\" he admits, \"but we have a chance to get the team into decent shape. There's still a lot wrong with the English game but we have a group of players who are going somewhere. \"Nasser Hussain deserves a lot of praise. I just like the guy. He's a good captain who knows what he wants. I've always said the captain is the manager of the shop and the coach is his chief consultant. We work very well together.\" England's Zimbabwean consultant will have a former compatriot uppermost in mind when he offers a \"quiet word of advice\" to each of the players this week. Graeme Hick's perennial \"comeback\" resumes on Thursday. Fletcher, who knew Hick when he was showing Bradmanesque potential as a Zimbabwean teenager, is convinced that a lasting resurrection is possible for a player whose commitment and temperament have since been questionable. \"We need more senior pros,\" Fletcher emphasises, \"to support Hussain, Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart. There's no doubt that Graeme Hick is a great batter who could be at the core of our team. I still think he can finally deliver true quality at test level. They certainly rate Hick in Zimbabwe. It's time for him to earn that same respect in this country.\"",

Her husband, meanwhile, has just confided to the New York Times that, while he will reduce his workload around May 24 - the day his fourth child is due - full paternity leave is not an option. The first couple's professional differences of opinion over family-friendly working, or work-life balance as the government now prefers to call it, reflect tensions at the heart of the Blair administration which have led to today's court case. The row between unions and ministers centres on the fact that, while the New Labour government has gone much further than its Tory predecessor in signing up to the European Parental Leave Directive, it has chosen to implement the law in a way many regard as minimal and deeply grudging. The new right entitles each parent to take up to 13 weeks off work to spend with their child up to its fifth birthday, but the leave is unpaid and applies only to parents of children born before last December 15, when the law was introduced.

Many other countries, including Italy and Sweden, have been more generous still, making parental leave available to all working parents with children up to the age of eight. Britain, however, is still trying to reconcile two impulses, aiming to achieve a culture change towards more family-friendly working with the minimum of regulation. Tony Blair can only become more aware of the stresses involved in that compromise as he rushes between baby and office attempting to make a go of his \"third way\" version of paternity leave.",

He's keen to get the pupils involved in web page and multimedia production using Macromedia's Flash 4 software. </strong> Flash 4 has transformed how we approach multimedia. It is almost the perfect software for schools, especially secondary, where it could have unlimited potential. It delivers true multimedia and interactivity in an ultra-compact format. We make heavy use of its streaming MP3 audio capabilities for our website. It produces many of our interactive games, for example at <a href=\"http://www.ambleside.schoolzone.co.uk/ambleweb/lookcover/lookcover.html\">www.ambleside.schoolzone.co.uk/ambleweb/lookcover/lookcover.html</a> Flash 4 is also used by children for online presentations. It's as easy as a painting program and, as it stores images in a very effective way, it is simple for any child to create interfaces in no time at all. It can import almost any media that the children produce, such as audio or scanned pictures, using a simple drag-and-drop process. </p> <p> Complex interactions can be built using the point-and-click environment that even primary-age children can understand. Finished work does not have to live in a web page; with a single click, it can be made into small, stand-alone applications that can be copied on to a floppy disk to take home or to download for offline use. These will run on any machine with a browser installed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ambleside.schoolzone.co.uk/ambleweb/bagpoem/bagpoem.html\">www.ambleside.schoolzone.co.uk/ambleweb/bagpoem/bagpoem.html</a></p> <p> <strong> Gordon Beckett is head of RE at Woodford High School </strong></p> <p> I first got interested in the internet as a way of making RE resources available for my students outside school time, then I began to help design the school website.</p> <p> First I recruited some sixth formers for a web design team. Then I found a very useful piece of software called Arachnophilia. It lets me build interactive pages with ease, dipping in and out of the html language as and when necessary. </p> <p> The other key piece of software I use is Paintshop Pro, version 5 or later (found at <a href=\"http://www.jasc.com\">www.jasc.com</a>). The animation software which comes as part of the package is brilliant; it is simple to make educational animations which are then saved as animated gifs (a series of still images repeated in sequence). Most recently I have been working with the LEA adviser in Redbridge, Bill Gent, to build a religious education resource website.

      "bodyText": "Mark Robinson is head of ICT at Ambleside CE Primary School. He's keen to get the pupils involved in web page and multimedia production using Macromedia's Flash 4 software. Flash 4 has transformed how we approach multimedia. It is almost the perfect software for schools, especially secondary, where it could have unlimited potential. It delivers true multimedia and interactivity in an ultra-compact format. We make heavy use of its streaming MP3 audio capabilities for our website. It produces many of our interactive games, for example at www.ambleside.schoolzone.co.uk/ambleweb/lookcover/lookcover.html Flash 4 is also used by children for online presentations. It's as easy as a painting program and, as it stores images in a very effective way, it is simple for any child to create interfaces in no time at all. It can import almost any media that the children produce, such as audio or scanned pictures, using a simple drag-and-drop process. Complex interactions can be built using the point-and-click environment that even primary-age children can understand. Finished work does not have to live in a web page; with a single click, it can be made into small, stand-alone applications that can be copied on to a floppy disk to take home or to download for offline use. These will run on any machine with a browser installed. www.ambleside.schoolzone.co.uk/ambleweb/bagpoem/bagpoem.html Gordon Beckett is head of RE at Woodford High School I first got interested in the internet as a way of making RE resources available for my students outside school time, then I began to help design the school website. First I recruited some sixth formers for a web design team. Then I found a very useful piece of software called Arachnophilia. It lets me build interactive pages with ease, dipping in and out of the html language as and when necessary. The other key piece of software I use is Paintshop Pro, version 5 or later (found at www.jasc.com). The animation software which comes as part of the package is brilliant; it is simple to make educational animations which are then saved as animated gifs (a series of still images repeated in sequence). Most recently I have been working with the LEA adviser in Redbridge, Bill Gent, to build a religious education resource website. See it at www.re.leonet.co.uk. At our annual RE conference last year I posted resources and responses in advance so that students could get a feel for the type of work that would be going on. It went down so well that we now use the internet to extend the value and outcomes of live events and visits.

The site aims to provide around 200 answers a night, with different nights devoted to English, maths, geography/history, and science. The site also offers monitored chatrooms where students can talk to others with similar questions, and an archive of past questions.

Parents Network Schools still have some way to bridge the digital divide and team up with parents to create an online educational community, according to the first national survey of school-based ICT access by the Parents Information Network. PIN found parents are still more likely to ask teachers about ICT than be offered training or advice, while only 44% of schools make their ICT facililities more widely available. Only 42% of the 437 schools surveyed have a website; only 22% of those include areas specifically for parents. See full survey at www.pin.org.uk. Safety net A third of UK children have internet access at home, and 80% say it helps with their learning. But is it safe? KZuk.net has tried to allay parental fears with its free, dedicated internet service for children aged 4-12 years, which offers secure email and chat services, and a monitored net-surfing facility, Net Nanny. There are over 20,000 content pages across 10 different zones - covering art, music, games, penpals, quizzes, and an interactive magazine. Its homework club, with teachers online from 3.30pm to 6.00pm on weekdays, provides online access to teachers five days a week. For a free KZuk.net CD-Rom call 0845 661 2300.",

Result is a collaboration between Granada Media, IBM and others, and its trial involved 10 schools and 12 independent learners based in Hounslow, North Tyneside and Northamptonshire. Result's materials consisted of GCSE maths (shape and space) and science (periodic table and reactions). The materials, stored on computer hard disk, were shown on a TV or PC. Chris Hopson, Result's managing director, says: \"We've had an excellent reaction to our service. Teachers liked its flexibility, the rigour of the materials, which could be easily customised, and the ease of use.\"</p> <p>Max Buczynski, head of ICT at Henry Gotsch says: \"Digital TV has been a major breakthrough for teachers who are reluctant to use ICT - they've been the ones who have used it the most.\" Digital TV has also made an impact in home learning. Toby Buckle, an able pupil, who also attends Henry Gotsch, has been using Result's materials on his home PC. \"It's like having a science lesson, because you can do experiments and make notes,\" he says. His mother, Linda, agrees: \"I used to worry about television, video and computers limiting family talk, but this technology has taken it back out and encouraged more talk.\"</p> <p>Although Channel 4 did not take part in the Digital TV trials, the company is interested in using the technology, says Paul Ashton, commissioning editor of Channel 4 Learning. \"Interactivity is what education has been waiting for a long time, and at last, the technology has caught up.\" Ashton adds that Channel 4 has one of the largest archives of moving pictures and is keen to use its resources on all types of interactive platforms, including the internet, DVD-Rom discs and digital TV. \"We're preparing our archive for a multiplicity of delivery systems,\" he says.</p> <p><strong>A digital TV service for schools</strong></p> <p>Some schools are already using digital TV in the classroom.

These help with writing, but more recent computers, with their fast processors and huge memories, handle speech and writing simultaneously, as well as offering visual support and instant feedback. </p> <p> The main snag is cost. You need a sound card and good headset for each machine, and site licences for software are well beyond most individual departments' budgets. This is a constant bone of contention for almost all educational software in secondary schools, and one of the main reasons why so little is used. </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.rosettastone.com\">RosettaStone.com</a> is one of the longest established computerised language courses. It uses \"active immersion\" to teach 26 languages from Hindi to Welsh, and includes English speech and language therapists among its admirers. </p> <p> The scheme provides practice in listening comprehension in the early stages, proceeding by carefully graded steps to advanced syntax and spelling. This makes it ideal for schools, which have to introduce large numbers of pupils to foreign languages from scratch, and which also need to provide flexible and demanding teaching for the more talented. Practice is easy and enjoyable, and there is very extensive use of the foreign language in short sentences that make it easy to understand and learn. This is much better than most other software for beginners, which tends to concentrate on vocabulary. Site licences in the US cost $150 per machine for each of two levels in each language, but the free demo disk is well worth investigating.</p> <p> There is more choice post-GCSE level, including Eurotalk's innovative DVDs. The same company produces Asterix CD-Roms in French and German, each offering 20 hours of individual work in the style of the cartoon. You listen to a page from the story in the foreign language and, if you have fully understood it, proceed to the next. If not, you can call up three levels of help. First, the spoken text and directions appear in the bubbles of the cartoon. Next, you can have teachers notes on difficult points. Finally, there is a translation. You can hear the story, or any fragment of it, as often as you want, and there is a selection of games for consolidation. Price is again complicated - the set in each language costs \u00a329.99 for home use, but schools have to pay an additional \u00a350, with network licences from \u00a385 to \u00a3210 for 30 users.</p> <p> \u0095 What's the Point (Staffordshire Language Group, 01782 254242, \u00a328 +VAT) is a 10-minute video designed to encourage young people to continue to learn languages after leaving school. Its style is a fast-moving series of soundbytes and snippets, the most convincing of which are from a personnel manager who will not employ anyone who does not speak a foreign language, and from a young woman working for Michelin tyres who finds her French helpful. </p> <p> However, many of the tape's arguments linking language learning to the prospect of highly paid jobs are simplistic, and Sir Trevor McDonald's pep talk at the end does not begin to tackle the problems of discouragement and failure that, according to the tape, lead 90% of us to give up learning languages too early. This rather expensive video could be useful in further education, but chiefly is a starting point for investigating the real purpose and value of continued language learning.</p>",

The scheme provides practice in listening comprehension in the early stages, proceeding by carefully graded steps to advanced syntax and spelling. This makes it ideal for schools, which have to introduce large numbers of pupils to foreign languages from scratch, and which also need to provide flexible and demanding teaching for the more talented. Practice is easy and enjoyable, and there is very extensive use of the foreign language in short sentences that make it easy to understand and learn. This is much better than most other software for beginners, which tends to concentrate on vocabulary. Site licences in the US cost $150 per machine for each of two levels in each language, but the free demo disk is well worth investigating. There is more choice post-GCSE level, including Eurotalk's innovative DVDs. The same company produces Asterix CD-Roms in French and German, each offering 20 hours of individual work in the style of the cartoon. You listen to a page from the story in the foreign language and, if you have fully understood it, proceed to the next. If not, you can call up three levels of help. First, the spoken text and directions appear in the bubbles of the cartoon. Next, you can have teachers notes on difficult points. Finally, there is a translation. You can hear the story, or any fragment of it, as often as you want, and there is a selection of games for consolidation. Price is again complicated - the set in each language costs \u00a329.99 for home use, but schools have to pay an additional \u00a350, with network licences from \u00a385 to \u00a3210 for 30 users. \u0095 What's the Point (Staffordshire Language Group, 01782 254242, \u00a328 +VAT) is a 10-minute video designed to encourage young people to continue to learn languages after leaving school. Its style is a fast-moving series of soundbytes and snippets, the most convincing of which are from a personnel manager who will not employ anyone who does not speak a foreign language, and from a young woman working for Michelin tyres who finds her French helpful. However, many of the tape's arguments linking language learning to the prospect of highly paid jobs are simplistic, and Sir Trevor McDonald's pep talk at the end does not begin to tackle the problems of discouragement and failure that, according to the tape, lead 90% of us to give up learning languages too early. This rather expensive video could be useful in further education, but chiefly is a starting point for investigating the real purpose and value of continued language learning.",

      "body": "<p>Back in 1992/3 anyone who could get a world wide website working was immediately feted as a veteran. Now, with a wide range of web-authoring tools to choose from, anyone can be a web jockey. And just as schools discovered at the dawn of desktop publishing seven years earlier, once the task gets easy, excellent design differentiates good from bad.</p> <p> Unfortunately, while desktop publishing has a rich history of high quality typography as a starting point, some of the most sumptuous and expensive websites are among the worst examples of design anywhere. Corporate often is synonymous with ghastly.</p> <p> Teachers and students are thus left to plan from first principles and, above all, to do so with their common sense turned on. Luckily, teachers are communication professionals which is why education boasts so many great websites. Here are eight simple rules to start you thinking: </p> <p><strong> 1. </strong> Bad web designers often overdo large pictures and add too much special code to showcase their front page when the site is launched. That's without regard for those of us who have to view via a slow internet connection. You know better and must chant the mantra \"children hate to wait\".</p> <p> Elegant, lean, fast design takes skill and imagination. Test your pages with the same slow phone connection and poor computer that many users have. Your front page should be less than 25k, including everything. Graphics are more compact if their colour palettes are limited to three or four colours.</p> <p><strong> 2.</strong> Leave your guests with a clear model of the website's navigation. This doesn't mean filling half the screen with a contents table all the time. Book and architectural metaphors are so last century. Surely you can do better. Remember your audience will include children. At Ultralab, at Anglia Polytechnic University, when we tested children with some icons from adult life they surprised us with their misunderstandings; faced with a \"no entry\" sign, they took it to mean \"smoking allowed\". (There is no diagonal bar through what they took to be a cigarette!) </p> <p><strong> 3. </strong> Remember that as many as one in five are poor or reluctant readers. A text-heavy site with complex phrases and adult grammar will repel many. Where you must use text, add simple icons to aid recognition. Remember to complete the \"alt\" tags that label images and help visually impaired users to get at least a spoken description of the images. </p> <p> Text alone is rarely seductive and remember that, on a poor screen, tiny, anti-aliased graphics are hard to read. The computer screen is not paper. </p> <p><strong> 4.</strong> Be aware that there are many permutations of computer, operating system, browser and service provider, all hoping to persuade you to develop sites that support their monopoly by excluding others.

      "bodyText": "Back in 1992/3 anyone who could get a world wide website working was immediately feted as a veteran. Now, with a wide range of web-authoring tools to choose from, anyone can be a web jockey. And just as schools discovered at the dawn of desktop publishing seven years earlier, once the task gets easy, excellent design differentiates good from bad. Unfortunately, while desktop publishing has a rich history of high quality typography as a starting point, some of the most sumptuous and expensive websites are among the worst examples of design anywhere. Corporate often is synonymous with ghastly. Teachers and students are thus left to plan from first principles and, above all, to do so with their common sense turned on. Luckily, teachers are communication professionals which is why education boasts so many great websites. Here are eight simple rules to start you thinking: 1. Bad web designers often overdo large pictures and add too much special code to showcase their front page when the site is launched. That's without regard for those of us who have to view via a slow internet connection. You know better and must chant the mantra \"children hate to wait\". Elegant, lean, fast design takes skill and imagination. Test your pages with the same slow phone connection and poor computer that many users have. Your front page should be less than 25k, including everything. Graphics are more compact if their colour palettes are limited to three or four colours. 2. Leave your guests with a clear model of the website's navigation. This doesn't mean filling half the screen with a contents table all the time. Book and architectural metaphors are so last century. Surely you can do better. Remember your audience will include children. At Ultralab, at Anglia Polytechnic University, when we tested children with some icons from adult life they surprised us with their misunderstandings; faced with a \"no entry\" sign, they took it to mean \"smoking allowed\". (There is no diagonal bar through what they took to be a cigarette!) 3. Remember that as many as one in five are poor or reluctant readers. A text-heavy site with complex phrases and adult grammar will repel many. Where you must use text, add simple icons to aid recognition. Remember to complete the \"alt\" tags that label images and help visually impaired users to get at least a spoken description of the images. Text alone is rarely seductive and remember that, on a poor screen, tiny, anti-aliased graphics are hard to read. The computer screen is not paper. 4. Be aware that there are many permutations of computer, operating system, browser and service provider, all hoping to persuade you to develop sites that support their monopoly by excluding others. Our largest Ultralab projects regularly count over 50 such combinations accessing our servers, and you should test your site on a variety of them; why would you exclude anyone by design? Stick to open standards. 5. Think hard about how your site handles time. It is not enough to say: \"This page revised on 9/5/00.\" Was that its birthday treat, or is it revised weekly? There is a world of difference between a site that you expect to stay comfortingly static (the complete works of Shakespeare, for example) and one which you hope would change hourly (a news site). Be sure you help to fulfil people's expectations by indicating which of these your page is, and remember there is great merit in announcing forthcoming events and in summarising after closure.

Two, the player has denied any such rift exists.</p> <p>\"I am amazed that people have tried to suggest I had a blazing row with the manager and there had been a bust-up,\" Robbie told the official Liverpool web site. \"It simply is not true.

A startled Wenger ups the ante by calling Gheorge Hagi the \"European Maradona\". But the plan back-fires when it becomes clear he's not referring to the Romanian's age, or his penchant for pies - but his play-making ability.</p> <p>With Gala ahead and the final hand about to be played, a stranger walks into the room.

      "bodyText": "A BRAND NEW SERIES Welcome to the first in an occasional series profiling those tedious transfer rumours which drag on and on, hanging around all summer like a hazy cloud of journalist's sweat. 1. Robbie Fowler to Manchester United. Not to be confused with Robbie Fowler to Arsenal (which will be number 2 tomorrow). The origins of this particular rumour can be found in the Sun, who argue that a irreparable rift has developed between Fowler and Gerard Houllier after the Liverpool manager dropped the world's most mature scamp for the Reds' crucial final game of the season at Bradford. United have offered \u00a315m to secure what would be the most sensational transfer since United bought Andy Cole, which was the most sensational transfer since United bought Eric Cantona. But the Fiver doesn't fancy their chances much for two reasons. One, hoards of irate Kopites would rip the Anfield boardroom to pieces before turning their attentions to the people in it. Two, the player has denied any such rift exists. \"I am amazed that people have tried to suggest I had a blazing row with the manager and there had been a bust-up,\" Robbie told the official Liverpool web site. \"It simply is not true. The manager explained why I wasn't in the squad on Sunday and I fully respect his decision.\" That's put paid to talk of the most natural finisher in the Premiership leaving Anfield in the close season, then. Actually, no it hasn't. * * * * * * * * * * * * * LOW-LYING (BUT NOT LOW AND LYING) Sign up now for the Euro. It's exactly the Fiver, except it's not, because it's solely about Euro 2000.

Free trial subscription details here. * * * * * * * * * * * * * DEAL! In a smoky room in the back-streets of Copenhagen, Arsenal's card-shark king Arsene Wenger is raising the psychological stakes. \"I have a contract with Arsenal until the end of the 2002 season, and I will respect it.\" That's an impressive opening from Wenger, reassuring his team on the eve of the big game and putting the Gunners into early profit. \"Who says Arsenal are favourites?\" responds a fiery Gheorghe Hagi, countering with a verbal flush (4,5,6,7,8). \"Every day in training you have to reach into the soul of a player,\" philosophises manager Fatih Terim, whilst laying down a bicycle wheel. A startled Wenger ups the ante by calling Gheorge Hagi the \"European Maradona\". But the plan back-fires when it becomes clear he's not referring to the Romanian's age, or his penchant for pies - but his play-making ability. With Gala ahead and the final hand about to be played, a stranger walks into the room. It's David O'Leary and he's got a set of mirrors strapped to his cufflinks. \"I think Arsenal will beat them without too many problems. We beat Roma and Spartak Moscow on our way to the semi-finals and Galatasaray are not in the same class as either of those teams,\" says the man with the inside knowledge (and a 20-year career at Highbury). \"To be honest, I wasn't impressed with their defence. They're there to be got at and I can see Arsenal scoring a few goals,\" he adds, before laying down five aces. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Gianluca has not achieved anything.

Not only did ICM confirm private Tory polling and Gallup's poll for the Daily Telegraph showing that the government's popularity has slipped by around 3% - and the Tories have gained 2% - it also signalled a sharp slide in Tony Blair's popularity.</p> <p>The widespread admiration for Blair's performance as prime minister since 1997, grudgingly acknowledged by many who do not vote for him, has been central to Labour's standing in office.</p> <p>After a rough few weeks, a wider sense of disappointment with the government's failure to fulfill the expectations it aroused on health, education and transport has been compounded, so most MPs agree, by anger among older voters at the 75p pension increase in April - in line with inflation, but mean-spirited.</p> <p>So Mr Blair did not suffer alone when he saw his personal approval rating fall from +34% in 1999 to just +1% now. Gordon Brown slipped from +23% to +2% despite the strong performance of the economy.</p> <p>Robin Cook, Alan Milburn, Jack Straw, Steven Byers, John Prescott are some of the several ministers on the sharp end of the delivery agenda who also suffered, even though it was non-delivery of an \"ethical dimension\" to foreign policy which may have hurt Mr Cook among Labour voters.</p> <p>Not everyone got thumped though: Margaret Beckett (+16%), David Blunkett (halved but still +14%), Clare Short (+11%) and even the prince of darkness, Peter Mandelson (from -6% a year ago to +14% - it must be the Belfast factor again), remain popular - for reasons which are not always obvious.</p> <p>Mo Mowlam's case is simultaneously obvious and puzzling. Voters like her cheery hands-on (more literally than most) style, her warmth and spontaneity, and they admire her, as she admitted on Radio 4, for pluckily fighting back against her brain tumour in 1996-97. She is a natural underdog's heroine, a bit like Ken Livingstone.</p> <p>But being lovable in a Kennish way - and from a distance - is not necessarily the easiest style to work with at close quarters in government. There are plenty of critics of Ms Mowlam's approach in Whitehall, people who felt she had not taken enough detailed grip of policy in Belfast and does not now when she ranges across a host of ministerial departments as the \"enforcer\".</p> <p>It is never an easy job and few MPs have made a good fist of it. Even Michael Heseltine had his critics who said it was all talk and no show. Yesterday the People's Mo loyally defended the government. Mr Blair's reputation was a \"caricature\", she said, the government does listen to voters, although it is perceived not to be listening. The poll was not good, but for a mid-term poll \"no worse than any other government\", she added.</p> <p>She also made plain she might be open to the idea of becoming party chairman, a proposed post which ex-general secretary of the Labour Party, Lord Tom Sawyer, this week revived as a means of keeping party and government in touch, so much harder now ministers are so busy, he conceded.</p>",

The widespread admiration for Blair's performance as prime minister since 1997, grudgingly acknowledged by many who do not vote for him, has been central to Labour's standing in office. After a rough few weeks, a wider sense of disappointment with the government's failure to fulfill the expectations it aroused on health, education and transport has been compounded, so most MPs agree, by anger among older voters at the 75p pension increase in April - in line with inflation, but mean-spirited. So Mr Blair did not suffer alone when he saw his personal approval rating fall from +34% in 1999 to just +1% now. Gordon Brown slipped from +23% to +2% despite the strong performance of the economy. Robin Cook, Alan Milburn, Jack Straw, Steven Byers, John Prescott are some of the several ministers on the sharp end of the delivery agenda who also suffered, even though it was non-delivery of an \"ethical dimension\" to foreign policy which may have hurt Mr Cook among Labour voters. Not everyone got thumped though: Margaret Beckett (+16%), David Blunkett (halved but still +14%), Clare Short (+11%) and even the prince of darkness, Peter Mandelson (from -6% a year ago to +14% - it must be the Belfast factor again), remain popular - for reasons which are not always obvious. Mo Mowlam's case is simultaneously obvious and puzzling. Voters like her cheery hands-on (more literally than most) style, her warmth and spontaneity, and they admire her, as she admitted on Radio 4, for pluckily fighting back against her brain tumour in 1996-97. She is a natural underdog's heroine, a bit like Ken Livingstone. But being lovable in a Kennish way - and from a distance - is not necessarily the easiest style to work with at close quarters in government. There are plenty of critics of Ms Mowlam's approach in Whitehall, people who felt she had not taken enough detailed grip of policy in Belfast and does not now when she ranges across a host of ministerial departments as the \"enforcer\". It is never an easy job and few MPs have made a good fist of it. Even Michael Heseltine had his critics who said it was all talk and no show. Yesterday the People's Mo loyally defended the government. Mr Blair's reputation was a \"caricature\", she said, the government does listen to voters, although it is perceived not to be listening. The poll was not good, but for a mid-term poll \"no worse than any other government\", she added. She also made plain she might be open to the idea of becoming party chairman, a proposed post which ex-general secretary of the Labour Party, Lord Tom Sawyer, this week revived as a means of keeping party and government in touch, so much harder now ministers are so busy, he conceded.",

As one of the 420,000 people in Britain who has epilepsy, I always like to find the places where I can cool off my brain if I feel a seizure coming on. Not that it always works. As a journalist, I have had seizures working on news desks, in editing suites and out on shoots. There is nothing more unnerving when watching film rushes than hearing a dull thud, off-camera, then realising that someone collapsed on the filming shoot and it must have been you. </p> <p>Like many people, my fits started at puberty. I had my first full convulsive seizure, aged 11, in the school library. I then continued to have the occasional fit, usually during my least favourite activities - maths, chemistry and cross-country runs. </p> <p>Finding out I was epileptic was a big shock for someone already dealing with all the changes of puberty. I remember thinking 'How will I ever be attractive now?' and the deep humiliation of being ejected from the local swimming club. </p> <p>But my school's reaction was OK. I wasn't allowed to climb in the gym but no teachers made strange comments and I was never teased by any of the kids. I think they'd all been given a talk about epilepsy. </p> <p>Meanwhile I gradually learned to deal with seizures: not eating regularly was a bad idea and not getting enough sleep would sometimes put me in danger. Forgetting to take medication was another prime source of trouble. But often I would get enough warning of a seizure to let people know that I was feeling strange. </p> <p>Much still remains a mystery about epilepsy. Seizures, caused by a temporary disturbance in the electrochemical activity in the brain, can be the result of injury. As for me, several of my aunts had seizures and it helped me to know that I wasn't the only person with this condition. \"Oh it runs in the family,\" I would say when people asked. </p> <p>Throughout life, I have used a variety of drugs to control my seizures, none with complete success. And I know from experience that many can have unwanted side effects, such as weight gain, double vision or risk of liver damage. </p> <p>At various times, I have tried controlling my seizures in other ways, such as meditation or homoeopathy, always using these methods in conjunction with medication. I can't claim to have found a solution yet. </p> <p>It wasn't until I hit the job market after university that I first noticed other people's reactions and realised that other people's feelings about epilepsy could have a major impact on my ability to earn a living.\"It's not that we have a problem with your epilepsy, but we would worry about your health,\" said one employer as she turned me down. </p> <p>At 18 I was offered one job subject to a medical. After I said that I had controlled epilepsy, I was rejected for the job on the medical grounds that, \"Your teeth aren't in good condition, you need a filling.\" Even now, I can remember my fury and embarrassment. I knew that I had been discriminated against and, back in those days, before the disability discrimination act, there was nothing I could do about it. </p> <p>There are 40 different types of seizure, ranging from brief, hardly noticeable \"absences\", to the more dramatic \"tonic clonic\" seizure, still sometimes called a \"grand mal\" seizure. During these people lose consciousness and convulse. My seizures tend to be these quite dramatic ones. I'll feel a bit strange, think, \"Oh my god I'm in danger of having a fit,\" and wake up either still at my desk or on the floor. </p> <p>But while 80% of people can control, or partially control their epilepsy with medication, discrimination in the job market remains difficult, and so do some people's reactions to epilepsy. There's still a lot of fear about the condition, and the old assumption that you have some sort of mental disorder or illness lives on. </p> <p>Epilepsy is now covered by the disability discrimination act but \"some employers still run a mile when they hear that a person has epilepsy\", says Elaine Faulkner, of the National Society for Epilepsy. The NSE estimates that if the average person takes 10 interviews to get a job, someone with epilepsy will need 20. </p> <p>Dr John Chaplin, chair of the International Bureau for Epilepsy's employment commission, reckons that 25% of people with controlled epilepsy are unemployed as a result of stigma about the condition. </p> <p>As for me, I got my first magazine journalism job by pretending I did not have epilepsy. The editor was often out and did not realise that I occasionally used his office as my own private seizure space. I finally came clean about the seizures three years later, when I was offered the news editorship. </p> <p>Nowadays I wouldn't feel comfortable working for people who didn't know about my condition. It means that I can tell them what to do if I have a fit and I don't have to play at being someone I am not. People accept that once every few months I keel over. </p> <p>But for anyone with epilepsy, being in the workplace means having a range of strategies for avoiding seizures at work if at all possible and dealing with them when they happen. I know that I'm vulnerable to seizures at certain times. If possible, I don't combine lack of sleep and stress at the same time as my period. I also try to avoid spending too long on a computer without a break. </p> <p>Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't - and sometimes I just can't be bothered to follow my own rules anyway. At one time, I was almost proud to be working 17-hour days. </p> <p>When I do have a fit, if deadlines are tight, I continue work after a 10-minute break. Otherwise I go home to sleep. I ask people to remind me about the seizure, because some times I completely forget, which can be the after effect of my fits. And there is nothing worse than being at home and suddenly getting a flashback to something that you cannot remember. </p> <p>If you find you are working with someone who has epilepsy, ask them if they have seizures at work and what they would like you to do, because everybody's experience is different. The important things are to put something soft under their head to prevent injury, make sure they are not lying somewhere dangerous - like the top of a flight of stairs - and don't put anything in their mouth. </p> <p>All I ask for is an acceptance that it is OK to have the occasional seizure, just as it is OK for others to have a migraine or stomach upset. And I assure people that if I do have a seizure, they don't need to clear the room or call an ambulance. Usually, it is only ignorance that causes problems, and the more someone with epilepsy can tell their colleagues about what to expect the better.</p>",

Yesterday, it led its front page with a nine-month-old scientific report suggesting that lettuces and sprouts grown to organic standards with the help of farmyard manure had 100 times more E coli cells than conventionally grown ones. Shock. Was not E coli responsible for all those deaths in Lanarkshire? \"The findings will alarm millions who switched to organic foods following the BSE crisis and concern over the safety of GM foods,\" said the Mail. </p> <p>But should it? Is organic farming inherently more risky than conventional farming, as a stream of articles and TV programmes in the past six months on both sides of the Atlantic have suggested? Unhappily for the Mail, the answer is no. E coli is one of the commonest microbiological organisms on the planet. It is everywhere. On your coffee cup, your pencil, your hands, in everybody's stomach. </p> <p>The Daily Mail report glossed over the fact that the E coli found in the organically grown lettuces was totally harmless and indeed rather welcome.

At least they were being grown in biologically alive land. </p> <p>But one strain of E coli - 0157 - can indeed be virulent and deadly, and the Mail was quick to report that Tesco had recently withdrawn all its organic mushrooms after a routine check by environmental health officers found one with 0157.

It went on to say that the strain found in the Tesco mushroom was completely harmless. </p> <p>So where are all these organic scare stories coming from? What's new about muck? As the Soil Association, which sets UK organic standards points out, animal manure has been used for thousands of years as an essential component to maintain the organic matter content, biological activity, fertility and structural stability of agricultural soils. Moreover, conventional UK farmers use about 80m tonnes of it a year as a fertiliser. Just 9,000 tonnes goes on organic land and crops.

      "body": "<p>It is 1969 and a young Harvard research graduate, Kilmer McCully, is working in his laboratory in Boston with feverish energy. He has stumbled upon a vital clue to the cause of heart disease and he thinks his discovery could change the course of modern medicine. \"I was so excited, I had difficulty sleeping for over two weeks,\" he recalls. </p> <p>He had had a hunch while studying a rare and fatal genetic disease, homocystinuria, in children. He rushed back to his lab to examine slides from the organs of a two-month-old baby boy who had died shortly before of the condition. Now, after some inspired detective work, he is sure his hunch is right. </p> <p>What McCully saw in front of him all those years ago was that the arteries of this tiny child were severely damaged. They looked like those of old patients who have died of heart attacks or strokes. Yet the baby was obviously too young to have lived in any of the ways that were supposed to lead to heart disease. He was too immature to have consumed too much fat, too small to have failed to exercise, and too innocent to have smoked. There was no cholesterol deposited in his artery walls. Something else had to be responsible for the clogging up of his blood vessels that had led to his death. </p> <p>McCully remembered two previous cases of children who had died of homocystinuria. He re-examined the slides from their autopsies. There was his clue again - they too had damaged arteries. The culprit in all three cases was homocysteine. </p> <p>Homocysteine is an amino acid [see box] and children with homocystinuria lack the enzymes to process it properly, so it builds up to dangerous levels in their blood. </p> <p>\"Chance favours only the prepared mind,\" according to Louis Pasteur, and McCully had by chance trained not only in medicine and pathology but also in biochemistry and molecular genetics with the discoverer of DNA structure, James Watson. He was able to make those great leaps and connections that characterise scientific breakthroughs. He was also peculiarly qualified to realise the enormous implications of what he was seeing. </p> <p>Heart disease was sweeping the western world like an epidemic at the time, claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. Today it is still Britain's biggest killer, leading to premature death in more than 175,000 people a year - that's more than all cancers put together. </p> <p>The pharmaceutical industry has made a fortune selling drugs to prevent it. Vast sums of money and distinguished acedemic careers have been devoted to trying to find out what causes it.

Aspirin is also an anti-clotting agent and has been a phenomenal success in reducing strokes, heart disease and dementia, but \"it's very cheap and it doesn't make money, so most drugs firms are not interested,\" says Professor Peter Elwood, of the University of Wales College of Medicine, who has done pioneering work on it. </p> <p>The cost to the NHS of cholesterol-lowering drugs, 90% of which are now statins, has soared from \u00a334m in 1992 to \u00a3190m last year. \"The drugs companies always want them more heavily prescribed,\" says Herxheimer. \"If the homocysteine story is true, there is nothing much in it for them.\" </p> <p> McCully's story has a familiar ring for Charles Medawar, who set up Social Audit to campaign for consumers on medicinal policy.

Cholesterol levels haven't changed that much, and nor has our diet, except perhaps in one signficant way. In the mid-60s, food manufacturers started fortifying food and in particular cereals with B vitamins.

I had hoped it would make a difference.\" </p> <p><strong>Protein poisoning The homocysteine hypothesis</strong></p> <p>Homocysteine (pronounced homo-sis-teen) is an amino acid which our bodies uses to build tissues. We derive it from another amino acid, methionine, which is found in animal protein - meat, milk and eggs. But too much homocysteine in the blood increases your risk of heart disease. </p> <p>In test-tube studies, homocysteine has been shown to injure blood vessel linings, to hasten the build-up of scar tissue, and to encourage blood clots. You can control levels of homocysteine by making sure you have enough B vitamins to break down any excess, in particular B6, B12 and folic acid. If you are deficient in these vitamins, homocysteine seems to attack the walls of the arteries. We get these B vitamins from fresh green vegeta bles, fruit and whole foods but they are easily destroyed by processing. Homocysteine could help explain the other risk factors for heart disease. Smoking and inactivity lead to raised homocysteine levels. Men are at greater risk of heart disease than women and during their reproductive years, women's homocysteine levels are about 20% lower than men's.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is 1969 and a young Harvard research graduate, Kilmer McCully, is working in his laboratory in Boston with feverish energy. He has stumbled upon a vital clue to the cause of heart disease and he thinks his discovery could change the course of modern medicine. \"I was so excited, I had difficulty sleeping for over two weeks,\" he recalls. He had had a hunch while studying a rare and fatal genetic disease, homocystinuria, in children. He rushed back to his lab to examine slides from the organs of a two-month-old baby boy who had died shortly before of the condition. Now, after some inspired detective work, he is sure his hunch is right. What McCully saw in front of him all those years ago was that the arteries of this tiny child were severely damaged. They looked like those of old patients who have died of heart attacks or strokes. Yet the baby was obviously too young to have lived in any of the ways that were supposed to lead to heart disease. He was too immature to have consumed too much fat, too small to have failed to exercise, and too innocent to have smoked. There was no cholesterol deposited in his artery walls. Something else had to be responsible for the clogging up of his blood vessels that had led to his death. McCully remembered two previous cases of children who had died of homocystinuria. He re-examined the slides from their autopsies. There was his clue again - they too had damaged arteries. The culprit in all three cases was homocysteine. Homocysteine is an amino acid [see box] and children with homocystinuria lack the enzymes to process it properly, so it builds up to dangerous levels in their blood. \"Chance favours only the prepared mind,\" according to Louis Pasteur, and McCully had by chance trained not only in medicine and pathology but also in biochemistry and molecular genetics with the discoverer of DNA structure, James Watson. He was able to make those great leaps and connections that characterise scientific breakthroughs. He was also peculiarly qualified to realise the enormous implications of what he was seeing. Heart disease was sweeping the western world like an epidemic at the time, claiming hundreds of thousands of lives. Today it is still Britain's biggest killer, leading to premature death in more than 175,000 people a year - that's more than all cancers put together. The pharmaceutical industry has made a fortune selling drugs to prevent it. Vast sums of money and distinguished acedemic careers have been devoted to trying to find out what causes it. Supermarket shelves are filled with high-priced, low-fat products designed to help you avoid it. Yet there are lots of unanswered questions about the prevailing view of heart disease, and in particular the idea that fat and cholesterol are to blame. McCully realised that if he was right, and homocysteine was the culprit, the experts might have been barking up the wrong tree. What's more, since homocysteine levels can be controlled by taking vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid, cheap supplements might be more effective than expensive drugs or guilt-inducing fat subsitutes. McCully sent off his observations to a respected scientific journal for publication. He felt that his homocysteine theory made sense of some of the previously inexplicable statis tics. More than half of those who have heart attacks have no recognisable risk factors, for example. He didn't yet fully understand the mechanisms but he was looking forward to open debate with others studying heart disease. \"I hoped it was significant. I had a big laboratory at Harvard. I assumed it would all be welcomed,\" he says. Nothing could have prepared him for the violence of the reaction to his findings.

I'm 25 and generally fit and well. Should I accept his advice? </p> <p><strong> A:</strong> It all depends on your philosophy - and nationality. There are now guidelines that spell out for GPs which symptoms are most suggestive of cancer and when to refer urgently. But the Americans aren't relying on GPs to read guidelines. The American Cancer Society now recommends that men and women with no symptoms and average risk of cancer should have a full cancer check up every three years from the age of 20, and every year from the age of 40.

      "body": "<p><strong>Jeff Noon:</strong> Hi, this is Jeff. I'm here!</p> <p> <strong>tinker00:</strong> Vurt, Pollen and Nymphomation were all based on real locations in Manchester - you could actually follow people's routes and recognise places (and try to catch you out...) Needle in the Groove uses the names of Manc bands as street names instead. What's the reason for this, have you deliberately distanced it from 'real' places? I thought it made your previous books more surreal and imaginative - you had all these incredible events against a background of Whalley Range and Rusholme and Alexandra Park. <br> PS I'm halfway through Needle in the Groove, and enjoying it... </p> <p> <strong>JF:</strong> In Needle I wanted to create a more explicit map of the city, a musical one. To be honest the idea started out as a satirical device against the corporatisation of Manchester, and how the businesses are keying into popular culture to sell their goods. And the book was written, however, it changed to a more poetic expression. On the CD of the book, especially, I think, it becomes a kind of prayer; a calling up of ghosts, if you like; musical ghosts.</p> <p> <strong> tamara:</strong> Firstly, I was wondering what your view is of hallucinogenic drugs, and if you see yourself as a sort of Timothy Leary-type guru. And as far as Vurt is concerned, which I loved, why feathers? </p> <p><strong>JF: </strong> I have very little experience of drugs, beyond ciggies and alcohol. I have a very addictive personality, and a few years ago I found myself totally enslaved to alcohol. I had to take charge of my life. Haven't had a drink now in over three years. So, I guess I would have to say \"No\" to drugs. In my work, I use the imagery of drugs a lot, and I know people think this must mean I myself am taking them, but it's just not like that. Lots of my characters shoot people, for instance, and I don't! I use drugs as a metaphor for change, a way of forcing my characters into a new way of being.</p> <p><strong>Misshobart:</strong> Are you going to go back into the Vurt? </p> <p><strong>JF: </strong> My work is changing. I'm working away from a strict SF thing, entering a new phase, where my work is look at more \"normal\" life, whatever normal means in a Jeff Noon kind of way!!! My work will always have a weird element to it, I know that, but the way I approach that weirdness will change. At this precise moment in time, I can't imagine going back to a Vurt type thing, not specifically. Maybe I'll change my mind once I've got through whatever it is I'm trying to get through. Leaving Manchester also means that I'm moving away from all those earlier books. I don't know what will happen next. Currently I'm involved in a number of experimental projects, and that seems right for me now.</p> <p> <strong> SimonreesX:</strong> What are your attitudes to remixing / sampling as applied to your work (&amp; literature in general). How would you feel if another writer or even musician (now your voice is recorded) 'sampled' your work. From another angle, could your publisher get another writer to 're-mix' your work... maybe a 'radio edit', twenty pages long with all the difficult bits taken out :-) </p> <p><strong>JF: </strong>Yeah, I'm totally up for this, whatever people want to do. It's a question of opening the written word up to a broader audience, letting words escape the confines of a book. I have another book out in the Autumn, Cobralingus, which is an series of experimental texts, where I push the whole remix idea to the very edge, and reveal exactly the various techniques I've devised in order to remix words. I'm also working on a project with another writer, which will be a shared remix, sending texts back and forth between us.</p> <p> <strong> Oliebrice:</strong> I was wondering whether you were listening to specific records when you wrote Needle in the groove, that inspired you, or whether you were just thinking of dub and stuff in general? </p> <p><strong>JF: </strong> I list a number of groups, musicians in the front pages of Needle; stuff I was listening to, and that I consider to have entered into a more liquified expression of music. It's not just about dub; I also mention Evan Parker and Derek Bailey, for instance, avant garde jazz musicians; and some experimental electronic people like Oval, Microstoria. There's a whole bunch of different types of music out there now, all becoming more and more liquid in its approach. I wanted Needle to reflect that change, and to participate in it.</p> <p> <strong> MPotter:</strong> Where next for dub fiction? Do you think the style works best with music-related themes, or are you planning on exploring other areas? </p> <p><strong>JF: </strong> No, Dub Fiction can work on any subject matter. Cobralingus contains ten pieces, all remixes of other people's texts, and none of them about music.</p> <p> <strong> Ktopping:</strong> Your writing has always been closely associated with Manchester. Why the move to Brighton, and how do you see it affecting the way you write and the things you write about? </p> <p><strong>JF: </strong> I moved to Brighton for many reasons, some of them purely personal. On a work level, I felt that I'd said more or less all I could say about Manchester. There's only so many stories any one writer can produce, about any one location. Also, I was aware that I needed to kickstart my muse! And moving seemed a good way to do that. Writing Needle whilst still in Manchester, was very much a farewell to the city. How will the move affect my writing? Well, immensely, I hope! I'm in a period of change, which is my favourite place to be. Now, I have to see what comes out of it. It's exciting!</p> <p> <strong> Nathanmesser:</strong> Related to ktopping's question, how does Brighton compare with Manchester? Is it it's own cultural centre, or does it rely on London a lot? </p> <p><strong>JF:</strong> Brighton is totally different from Manchester, and from London. It's a unique place, very relaxed, chilled. And lots of artists, writers, film-makers etc live here. I love it. I feel like I'm part of a scene already, and I've only been here a few months. It's very easy to meet people here, very friendly. And nobody looks at you. You can be who you like, without hassle.</p> <p> <strong> dan314:</strong> Needle in the Groove seems to flow, rather like a piece of music. As one who usually reads slowly, I found that with this book the opposite was true, perhaps due to its almost rhythmic style. I wonder how much this style is a result of your method of writing; for example did you write most of it over a short, intense period? Also what was your inspiration for, and was it hard to keep up, your style of punctuation? </p> <p><strong>JF: </strong> My first attempts at writing the book (based purely on the idea of the liquid music remix) produced much more obvious texts, written in an entirely normal style. I kept getting stuck, until I realised that I had to allow the remix to affect the prose, in a symbolic way. Getting rid of the fullstops, and introducing the slash effect, this allowed the music to flow into the words. Once I'd come up with this technique, the book more or less wrote itself, in a very easy manner.</p> <p><strong>Andyuk:</strong> I'm interested in this CD you mentioned - don't know if you've ever heard of \"Trip City\" by Trevor Miller, but it had a cassette soundtrack by A Guy Called Gerald. The idea was to listen to the tracks while you read, think he was also trying to write in a 4/4 pattern too... sounds like Cobralingus is taking this further - nice1! </p> <p><strong>JF: </strong> I remember Trip City; it was on sale when I was in bookselling. The difference with Needle is that the words and the music are very intimately linked together. And no way am I writing in a 4/4 pattern. I hate 4/4 beat music. The book is totally against that idea.</p> <p><strong> Misshobart:</strong> Didn't know there was a CD of the book - where can i get this? </p> <p><strong>JF:</strong> The CD of Needle in the Groove is available from Sulphur records (Scanner's label.) It contains 14 pieces from the books, spoken by myself, music by David Toop. It not in any way a Talking Book; more a kind of tangent to the novel. It gets right inside the main character's head, and David's music is what I find inside there!</p> <p><strong>Nathanmesser:</strong> Are we likely to see (i.e. do you have planned :) any public readings to music of Needle in the Groove in club chill-outs or at festivals? Might make a good serialisation over several days at a festival. </p> <p><strong>JF: </strong> Yeah, I'm doing a series of readings, some of them with David Toop on the decks. We did the first one the other night in Brighton, and it went really well, I think. Here's the advert: 17th May, Borders Charing Cross Rd, London (just me); 19th ICA, London (with Toop); 24th, Leeds Borders, (just me); 25th, Contact Theatre, Manchester, (with Toop.) This last one takes place after the performance of Vurt, the theatre remix. If people want to see this play, it's on from the 18th, until mid June. <br> Re festivals, no plans as yet, depends on Mr Toop's whereabouts! Def doing the Edinburgh Book fest this August, with David.</p> <p><strong> Misshobart:</strong> Is this (Needle) the first time you've written in this way - with the words flowing like music. </p> <p><strong>JF:</strong> The idea of the remix fiction really started with the Disco Biscuits tour; that's when I first got the idea of doing a dub of a story. The remixes of Jabberwocky in Nymphomation were the first examples in my work. In Pixel Juice I extended the techniques a little, and that led to considering a whole novel based on the techniques. That's Needle. So, it's been building up all the way through my work. If you go back to Vurt: Totally feather up, living on the dubside. The idea is there already. And I think Scribble says at one point \"If you can remix Madonna after she's dead, why can't they remix the night?\" I guess I've been following that impulse all the way through to the present work, and on into Cobralingus.</p> <p><strong>racybrace:</strong> Do you think that you have successfully managed to wax lyrical in a fashion that truly befits the essence of music? </p> <p><strong>JF:</strong> I hope so. It's a very difficult thing to try, of course, and fraught with danger. I knew I just had to go for it, no holding back. Go mad with the prose. Some of it is very lyrical, and romantic, and I like this. A friend of mine described it as being like John Donne writing about dance culture, and that pleased me no end, even if it was a bit tongue-in-cheek.</p> <p><strong>Jatbrowne:</strong> I lost my enthusiasm for reading intelligently a while ago, and my books are gathering dust on the shelf (incl. Noon up to Pollen). At the moment, what with study and all, Tom Clancy is the deepest I get to go. Can you give us a few words that might rekindle the flame? </p> <p><strong>JF:</strong> Oh, I don't really know what to say. To me, books are like life, they're the blood; words are in the blood. Same with music. You've got to open yourself up some more, get in some input in your life. No input, no output; that's the rule.</p> <p> <strong> Imogen:</strong> Will you still write about Manchester now that you've moved to Brighton? Was the move a conscious decision to escape being seen as a Manchester writer? And finally, what is it about Brighton that you like and how does it differ from up north?</p> <p><strong>JF:</strong> I've covered this topic a bit already today. It was a conscious decision, to a degree. I needed a change in my life. Also, I started to feel that I wasn't really breaking through in Manchester. I wanted to mean more than I did, if you see what I mean. I have some great, brilliant fans there, but the vast majority of people don't even know who I am. I found myself putting a lot of energy (spiritual and physical) into promoting the city as an interesting literary landscape, but I wasn't really getting much feedback. <br> I find it very interesting that people keep asking me why I left the city. It doesn't really get asked of other artists, certainly not to the same degree. The reason is, I think, that I'm one of the few artists who has actually tackled the city as a subject matter in any serious, sustained way. A much more interesting question for me is to ask why this is; why are so few artists (in any medium, including pop music) using Manchester as a subject matter? The only other person apart from myself, that I can think of, is Morrissey, during the Smiths' period.</p> <p><strong>Racybrace:</strong> what section in book shops do you think that Needle in the Groove, and all future enterprises, will be filed? Do you foresee a new section of remixes appearing soon?</p> <p><strong>JF: </strong> I do feel the need to escape from the SF section of bookshops. For a while I didn't mind being there, but now I feel that it's actually keeping my work from my true audience. So Needle is an attempt to escape from there. Hopefully, the bookshops will understand, although I've already seen it in both general fiction, and SF. It's a long process, struggle. I want to reach people, in an interesting way. That's it. That's my mission.</p> <p><strong>Tamara:</strong> How do you feel about the cult of the DJ? What started, like so many musical movements, as a street/bedroom thing has now turned into DJs-as-rock stars, with all the attendant huge festivals/egos/money/sell-out issues. Is it a tyrannical reign they are imposing on us, force-feeding us the same sorry chart-bound music? Or do you think they are they still at the forefront of free expression and breaking new music? </p> <p><strong>JF: </strong> Yes, the cult of the DJ. I feel bit angry when I think about all the promise of dance music, and how a lot of it is now just cheesy chart fodder. For me, there are still lots of good things going, but they exist right on the very edges of dance culture, where the music fades into the avant-garde. I listen to a lot of records that seems to come from this liquid area. Oval and Microstoria, whom I mentioned earlier, are examples of this kind of expression. They're not really designed to dance to, but you can feel the traces of dance music in there. I have very little time for the DJ as cultural hero theory, but appreciate the massive change they're brought about, in music, and how it is listened to, and most importantly, how it is made. The whole thing about remix culture, which is the period we're all now living through, has come from that moment when the DJ started to come to prominence. For that reason, they should be celebrated. Just lay off the cheese, guys!</p> <p><strong>misshobart:</strong> What do you enjoy reading? And are you working on a new book? <br> Also, it seems as if all your books are built on very detailed maps of Manc. Is this the starting point for you? Do you have this picture in your head before you then add the flavour, the characters? Do you know where they live first before building their own individual pictures up?</p> <p><strong>JF: </strong> Working on the remix project with the other guy, I mentioned. Cobralingus coming out in Autumn. I have an idea for a novel, a big novel; the next step. <br> What am I reading? At this precise moment, a collection of Steven Jay Gould's essays on natural history. Very good. Lots of ideas in there. <br> Re the maps: No, not really, the map comes quite late in the process. the characters find themselves in a certain space, and the map forms around them.</p> <p> <strong>Misshobart:</strong> When's cobralingus out? </p> <p><strong>JF:</strong> Cobralingus is out in the Autumn; that's all I know up to now. It's coming from a small independent publisher called Codex Books who have a website at <a href=\"http://www.codexbooks.co.uk\"> www.codexbooks.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Misshobart:</strong> If you're up for sharing texts with another writer, remixing words / music etc, what about pushing it one stage further and getting your audience involved at your readings? do you ever do that? (no i don't mean audience participation) - but doing something more freestyle that just goes wherever Toop's mixing takes it?</p> <p><strong>JF: </strong> Getting audiences involved in the remix. Hmm...interesting. I would have to think about it, I mean, consider the tecniques involved. To a certain degree I'm responding to David's music anyway, because he's always adding things to the mix, life, it throws all my cues out the window. I have to just go with the flow, somehow or other. But, it's a good idea, misshobart, and I shall def consider it for some future date.</p> <p><strong>Misshobart:</strong> Well thank-you.

      "bodyText": "Jeff Noon: Hi, this is Jeff. I'm here! tinker00: Vurt, Pollen and Nymphomation were all based on real locations in Manchester - you could actually follow people's routes and recognise places (and try to catch you out...) Needle in the Groove uses the names of Manc bands as street names instead. What's the reason for this, have you deliberately distanced it from 'real' places? I thought it made your previous books more surreal and imaginative - you had all these incredible events against a background of Whalley Range and Rusholme and Alexandra Park. PS I'm halfway through Needle in the Groove, and enjoying it... JF: In Needle I wanted to create a more explicit map of the city, a musical one. To be honest the idea started out as a satirical device against the corporatisation of Manchester, and how the businesses are keying into popular culture to sell their goods. And the book was written, however, it changed to a more poetic expression. On the CD of the book, especially, I think, it becomes a kind of prayer; a calling up of ghosts, if you like; musical ghosts. tamara: Firstly, I was wondering what your view is of hallucinogenic drugs, and if you see yourself as a sort of Timothy Leary-type guru. And as far as Vurt is concerned, which I loved, why feathers? JF: I have very little experience of drugs, beyond ciggies and alcohol. I have a very addictive personality, and a few years ago I found myself totally enslaved to alcohol. I had to take charge of my life. Haven't had a drink now in over three years. So, I guess I would have to say \"No\" to drugs. In my work, I use the imagery of drugs a lot, and I know people think this must mean I myself am taking them, but it's just not like that. Lots of my characters shoot people, for instance, and I don't! I use drugs as a metaphor for change, a way of forcing my characters into a new way of being. Misshobart: Are you going to go back into the Vurt? JF: My work is changing. I'm working away from a strict SF thing, entering a new phase, where my work is look at more \"normal\" life, whatever normal means in a Jeff Noon kind of way!!! My work will always have a weird element to it, I know that, but the way I approach that weirdness will change. At this precise moment in time, I can't imagine going back to a Vurt type thing, not specifically. Maybe I'll change my mind once I've got through whatever it is I'm trying to get through. Leaving Manchester also means that I'm moving away from all those earlier books. I don't know what will happen next. Currently I'm involved in a number of experimental projects, and that seems right for me now. SimonreesX: What are your attitudes to remixing / sampling as applied to your work (&amp; literature in general). How would you feel if another writer or even musician (now your voice is recorded) 'sampled' your work. From another angle, could your publisher get another writer to 're-mix' your work... maybe a 'radio edit', twenty pages long with all the difficult bits taken out :-) JF: Yeah, I'm totally up for this, whatever people want to do. It's a question of opening the written word up to a broader audience, letting words escape the confines of a book. I have another book out in the Autumn, Cobralingus, which is an series of experimental texts, where I push the whole remix idea to the very edge, and reveal exactly the various techniques I've devised in order to remix words. I'm also working on a project with another writer, which will be a shared remix, sending texts back and forth between us. Oliebrice: I was wondering whether you were listening to specific records when you wrote Needle in the groove, that inspired you, or whether you were just thinking of dub and stuff in general? JF: I list a number of groups, musicians in the front pages of Needle; stuff I was listening to, and that I consider to have entered into a more liquified expression of music. It's not just about dub; I also mention Evan Parker and Derek Bailey, for instance, avant garde jazz musicians; and some experimental electronic people like Oval, Microstoria. There's a whole bunch of different types of music out there now, all becoming more and more liquid in its approach. I wanted Needle to reflect that change, and to participate in it. MPotter: Where next for dub fiction? Do you think the style works best with music-related themes, or are you planning on exploring other areas? JF: No, Dub Fiction can work on any subject matter. Cobralingus contains ten pieces, all remixes of other people's texts, and none of them about music. Ktopping: Your writing has always been closely associated with Manchester. Why the move to Brighton, and how do you see it affecting the way you write and the things you write about? JF: I moved to Brighton for many reasons, some of them purely personal. On a work level, I felt that I'd said more or less all I could say about Manchester. There's only so many stories any one writer can produce, about any one location. Also, I was aware that I needed to kickstart my muse! And moving seemed a good way to do that. Writing Needle whilst still in Manchester, was very much a farewell to the city. How will the move affect my writing? Well, immensely, I hope! I'm in a period of change, which is my favourite place to be. Now, I have to see what comes out of it. It's exciting! Nathanmesser: Related to ktopping's question, how does Brighton compare with Manchester? Is it it's own cultural centre, or does it rely on London a lot? JF: Brighton is totally different from Manchester, and from London. It's a unique place, very relaxed, chilled. And lots of artists, writers, film-makers etc live here. I love it. I feel like I'm part of a scene already, and I've only been here a few months. It's very easy to meet people here, very friendly. And nobody looks at you. You can be who you like, without hassle. dan314: Needle in the Groove seems to flow, rather like a piece of music. As one who usually reads slowly, I found that with this book the opposite was true, perhaps due to its almost rhythmic style. I wonder how much this style is a result of your method of writing; for example did you write most of it over a short, intense period? Also what was your inspiration for, and was it hard to keep up, your style of punctuation? JF: My first attempts at writing the book (based purely on the idea of the liquid music remix) produced much more obvious texts, written in an entirely normal style. I kept getting stuck, until I realised that I had to allow the remix to affect the prose, in a symbolic way. Getting rid of the fullstops, and introducing the slash effect, this allowed the music to flow into the words. Once I'd come up with this technique, the book more or less wrote itself, in a very easy manner. Andyuk: I'm interested in this CD you mentioned - don't know if you've ever heard of \"Trip City\" by Trevor Miller, but it had a cassette soundtrack by A Guy Called Gerald. The idea was to listen to the tracks while you read, think he was also trying to write in a 4/4 pattern too... sounds like Cobralingus is taking this further - nice1! JF: I remember Trip City; it was on sale when I was in bookselling. The difference with Needle is that the words and the music are very intimately linked together. And no way am I writing in a 4/4 pattern. I hate 4/4 beat music. The book is totally against that idea. Misshobart: Didn't know there was a CD of the book - where can i get this? JF: The CD of Needle in the Groove is available from Sulphur records (Scanner's label.) It contains 14 pieces from the books, spoken by myself, music by David Toop. It not in any way a Talking Book; more a kind of tangent to the novel. It gets right inside the main character's head, and David's music is what I find inside there! Nathanmesser: Are we likely to see (i.e. do you have planned :) any public readings to music of Needle in the Groove in club chill-outs or at festivals? Might make a good serialisation over several days at a festival. JF: Yeah, I'm doing a series of readings, some of them with David Toop on the decks. We did the first one the other night in Brighton, and it went really well, I think. Here's the advert: 17th May, Borders Charing Cross Rd, London (just me); 19th ICA, London (with Toop); 24th, Leeds Borders, (just me); 25th, Contact Theatre, Manchester, (with Toop.) This last one takes place after the performance of Vurt, the theatre remix. If people want to see this play, it's on from the 18th, until mid June. Re festivals, no plans as yet, depends on Mr Toop's whereabouts! Def doing the Edinburgh Book fest this August, with David. Misshobart: Is this (Needle) the first time you've written in this way - with the words flowing like music. JF: The idea of the remix fiction really started with the Disco Biscuits tour; that's when I first got the idea of doing a dub of a story. The remixes of Jabberwocky in Nymphomation were the first examples in my work. In Pixel Juice I extended the techniques a little, and that led to considering a whole novel based on the techniques. That's Needle. So, it's been building up all the way through my work. If you go back to Vurt: Totally feather up, living on the dubside. The idea is there already. And I think Scribble says at one point \"If you can remix Madonna after she's dead, why can't they remix the night?\" I guess I've been following that impulse all the way through to the present work, and on into Cobralingus. racybrace: Do you think that you have successfully managed to wax lyrical in a fashion that truly befits the essence of music? JF: I hope so. It's a very difficult thing to try, of course, and fraught with danger. I knew I just had to go for it, no holding back. Go mad with the prose. Some of it is very lyrical, and romantic, and I like this. A friend of mine described it as being like John Donne writing about dance culture, and that pleased me no end, even if it was a bit tongue-in-cheek. Jatbrowne: I lost my enthusiasm for reading intelligently a while ago, and my books are gathering dust on the shelf (incl. Noon up to Pollen). At the moment, what with study and all, Tom Clancy is the deepest I get to go. Can you give us a few words that might rekindle the flame? JF: Oh, I don't really know what to say. To me, books are like life, they're the blood; words are in the blood. Same with music. You've got to open yourself up some more, get in some input in your life. No input, no output; that's the rule. Imogen: Will you still write about Manchester now that you've moved to Brighton? Was the move a conscious decision to escape being seen as a Manchester writer? And finally, what is it about Brighton that you like and how does it differ from up north? JF: I've covered this topic a bit already today. It was a conscious decision, to a degree. I needed a change in my life. Also, I started to feel that I wasn't really breaking through in Manchester. I wanted to mean more than I did, if you see what I mean. I have some great, brilliant fans there, but the vast majority of people don't even know who I am. I found myself putting a lot of energy (spiritual and physical) into promoting the city as an interesting literary landscape, but I wasn't really getting much feedback. I find it very interesting that people keep asking me why I left the city. It doesn't really get asked of other artists, certainly not to the same degree. The reason is, I think, that I'm one of the few artists who has actually tackled the city as a subject matter in any serious, sustained way. A much more interesting question for me is to ask why this is; why are so few artists (in any medium, including pop music) using Manchester as a subject matter? The only other person apart from myself, that I can think of, is Morrissey, during the Smiths' period. Racybrace: what section in book shops do you think that Needle in the Groove, and all future enterprises, will be filed? Do you foresee a new section of remixes appearing soon? JF: I do feel the need to escape from the SF section of bookshops. For a while I didn't mind being there, but now I feel that it's actually keeping my work from my true audience. So Needle is an attempt to escape from there. Hopefully, the bookshops will understand, although I've already seen it in both general fiction, and SF. It's a long process, struggle. I want to reach people, in an interesting way. That's it. That's my mission. Tamara: How do you feel about the cult of the DJ? What started, like so many musical movements, as a street/bedroom thing has now turned into DJs-as-rock stars, with all the attendant huge festivals/egos/money/sell-out issues. Is it a tyrannical reign they are imposing on us, force-feeding us the same sorry chart-bound music? Or do you think they are they still at the forefront of free expression and breaking new music? JF: Yes, the cult of the DJ. I feel bit angry when I think about all the promise of dance music, and how a lot of it is now just cheesy chart fodder. For me, there are still lots of good things going, but they exist right on the very edges of dance culture, where the music fades into the avant-garde. I listen to a lot of records that seems to come from this liquid area. Oval and Microstoria, whom I mentioned earlier, are examples of this kind of expression. They're not really designed to dance to, but you can feel the traces of dance music in there. I have very little time for the DJ as cultural hero theory, but appreciate the massive change they're brought about, in music, and how it is listened to, and most importantly, how it is made. The whole thing about remix culture, which is the period we're all now living through, has come from that moment when the DJ started to come to prominence. For that reason, they should be celebrated. Just lay off the cheese, guys! misshobart: What do you enjoy reading? And are you working on a new book? Also, it seems as if all your books are built on very detailed maps of Manc. Is this the starting point for you? Do you have this picture in your head before you then add the flavour, the characters? Do you know where they live first before building their own individual pictures up? JF: Working on the remix project with the other guy, I mentioned. Cobralingus coming out in Autumn. I have an idea for a novel, a big novel; the next step. What am I reading? At this precise moment, a collection of Steven Jay Gould's essays on natural history. Very good. Lots of ideas in there. Re the maps: No, not really, the map comes quite late in the process. the characters find themselves in a certain space, and the map forms around them. Misshobart: When's cobralingus out? JF: Cobralingus is out in the Autumn; that's all I know up to now. It's coming from a small independent publisher called Codex Books who have a website at www.codexbooks.co.uk Misshobart: If you're up for sharing texts with another writer, remixing words / music etc, what about pushing it one stage further and getting your audience involved at your readings? do you ever do that? (no i don't mean audience participation) - but doing something more freestyle that just goes wherever Toop's mixing takes it? JF: Getting audiences involved in the remix. Hmm...interesting. I would have to think about it, I mean, consider the tecniques involved. To a certain degree I'm responding to David's music anyway, because he's always adding things to the mix, life, it throws all my cues out the window. I have to just go with the flow, somehow or other. But, it's a good idea, misshobart, and I shall def consider it for some future date. Misshobart: Well thank-you. And I dare you! JF: Gotta go now, write my latest tome! Many thanks for all the questions, and the interest in my work. Much appreciated. Best wishes Jeff",

      "body": "<p>Once again, Northern Ireland is on the brink and, once again, they've moved the abyss.</p> <p>This is the oldest and sourest joke from the great repertoire of black humour spawned in the province over the years. And like all such weary aphorisms, it is based on a central truth.</p> <p>This week we were supposed to be contemplating the enormously important, if somewhat ambiguous, proposal by the Provisional IRA to take its weapons out of service. Instead, we are watching a dangerous game of brinkmanship by the Ulster Unionists who want to retain the name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and the right to fly the Union flag over public buildings.</p> <p>Unionist leader David Trimble and his cohorts have dragged these symbolic issues to the very heart of the debate on the peace process. Unless the government gives way, they are saying, there may be no vote on, let alone acceptance of, the IRA disarmament plan, and therefore no return to power sharing.</p> <p>Many onlookers in Britain and further afield will snort with indignation and condemn the Unionist tactics as absurd and obscurantist. What on earth does it matter what the police force is called? At a moment of historic life-and-death decision-making, why worry about the pattern on the strip of linen flying over the town hall?</p> <p>We should resist the temptation to be so condescendingly dismissive of Unionist concerns. Like it or not, Mr Trimble and his party represent the solid pro-Union majority in the province; people who are at best uneasy about power-sharing, and appalled that 'their' police force is to be renamed.</p> <p>There lies the heart of the problem. The RUC, battered and bloodied by more than 30 years of paramilitary attack from both main communities (the first policeman killed in the troubles was shot by a loyalist gunman), is still a tribal force. Close on 90 per cent of its officers are Protestants. Its fortified stations and barracks, surmounted by the Union flag, are powerful symbols of sectarian division. To loyalists of most hues, the force is a reassuring bulwark against republican subversion. To nationalists, it is the most tangible instrument of repression and discrimination.</p> <p>The Patton report on reform of the RUC emphatically rejected cosmetic change, but it recognised that the root-and-branch changes needed to produce a force acceptable to all communities and had to be accompanied by a change of name.</p> <p>The government agreed. From next year, the force will somehow recruit Catholics and Protestants on a 50-50 basis. They will enter not the RUC, but the PSNI - the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p> <p>There has been intense speculation in the Irish press that the name change will be postponed, as a sop to loyalist opinion in the run-up to Saturday's vital vote on power sharing by the Ulster Unionists' ruling party council. The moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party has voiced its disquiet, while Sinn Fein has warned darkly that the IRA 'initiative' could be wrecked by last-minute wavering on police reform.</p> <p>Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson has moved this morning to snuff out the flames of rumour. He says the name change will go ahead as planned, along with other vital police reforms. But he has pointedly declined to accelerate the reform programme, and has floated the gimcrack notion of a George Cross RUC Foundation, to distribute alms to police officers and their families.</p> <p>The Unionists are angry and frustrated. They have been outflanked by the ingenious - some would say devious - IRA arms offer. If they reject it, they will be condemned as timid and reactionary. If they accept it, the party could split, as it did disastrously in the power-sharing experiment of 1973-74.</p> <p>Mr Trimble desperately needs some ammunition to take to his party council meeting on Saturday. To some extent, he is playing the oldest negotiating trick in the book, digging his heels in in the hope of last-minute concessions. But the government should recognise that symbols are vitally important in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Come to that, they are important everywhere. In Britain, a generation of incoherent and visceral debate on EU membership has turned largely on the symbols of alleged sovereignty, ranging from sterling to the Queen's head on postage stamps. We cannot deride the Unionist passion for flags and titles, for deep down, we all care about our identity and allegiance.</p> <p>The difference, for us in mainland Britain, is that we have not had that identity threatened by rebellion and hellish bloodshed. Our lives have not been daily distorted by bombings and assassinations.

      "bodyText": "Once again, Northern Ireland is on the brink and, once again, they've moved the abyss. This is the oldest and sourest joke from the great repertoire of black humour spawned in the province over the years. And like all such weary aphorisms, it is based on a central truth. This week we were supposed to be contemplating the enormously important, if somewhat ambiguous, proposal by the Provisional IRA to take its weapons out of service. Instead, we are watching a dangerous game of brinkmanship by the Ulster Unionists who want to retain the name of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and the right to fly the Union flag over public buildings. Unionist leader David Trimble and his cohorts have dragged these symbolic issues to the very heart of the debate on the peace process. Unless the government gives way, they are saying, there may be no vote on, let alone acceptance of, the IRA disarmament plan, and therefore no return to power sharing. Many onlookers in Britain and further afield will snort with indignation and condemn the Unionist tactics as absurd and obscurantist. What on earth does it matter what the police force is called? At a moment of historic life-and-death decision-making, why worry about the pattern on the strip of linen flying over the town hall? We should resist the temptation to be so condescendingly dismissive of Unionist concerns. Like it or not, Mr Trimble and his party represent the solid pro-Union majority in the province; people who are at best uneasy about power-sharing, and appalled that 'their' police force is to be renamed. There lies the heart of the problem. The RUC, battered and bloodied by more than 30 years of paramilitary attack from both main communities (the first policeman killed in the troubles was shot by a loyalist gunman), is still a tribal force. Close on 90 per cent of its officers are Protestants. Its fortified stations and barracks, surmounted by the Union flag, are powerful symbols of sectarian division. To loyalists of most hues, the force is a reassuring bulwark against republican subversion. To nationalists, it is the most tangible instrument of repression and discrimination. The Patton report on reform of the RUC emphatically rejected cosmetic change, but it recognised that the root-and-branch changes needed to produce a force acceptable to all communities and had to be accompanied by a change of name. The government agreed. From next year, the force will somehow recruit Catholics and Protestants on a 50-50 basis. They will enter not the RUC, but the PSNI - the Police Service of Northern Ireland. There has been intense speculation in the Irish press that the name change will be postponed, as a sop to loyalist opinion in the run-up to Saturday's vital vote on power sharing by the Ulster Unionists' ruling party council. The moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party has voiced its disquiet, while Sinn Fein has warned darkly that the IRA 'initiative' could be wrecked by last-minute wavering on police reform. Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson has moved this morning to snuff out the flames of rumour. He says the name change will go ahead as planned, along with other vital police reforms. But he has pointedly declined to accelerate the reform programme, and has floated the gimcrack notion of a George Cross RUC Foundation, to distribute alms to police officers and their families. The Unionists are angry and frustrated. They have been outflanked by the ingenious - some would say devious - IRA arms offer. If they reject it, they will be condemned as timid and reactionary. If they accept it, the party could split, as it did disastrously in the power-sharing experiment of 1973-74. Mr Trimble desperately needs some ammunition to take to his party council meeting on Saturday. To some extent, he is playing the oldest negotiating trick in the book, digging his heels in in the hope of last-minute concessions. But the government should recognise that symbols are vitally important in Northern Ireland. Come to that, they are important everywhere. In Britain, a generation of incoherent and visceral debate on EU membership has turned largely on the symbols of alleged sovereignty, ranging from sterling to the Queen's head on postage stamps. We cannot deride the Unionist passion for flags and titles, for deep down, we all care about our identity and allegiance. The difference, for us in mainland Britain, is that we have not had that identity threatened by rebellion and hellish bloodshed. Our lives have not been daily distorted by bombings and assassinations. Our streets are not patrolled by armed forces and our cities, by and large, are not disfigured by ghettos. As the hours tick away to Saturday's fateful decision by the Ulster Unionists, we should recognise that their pleas for the RUC and for the Union flag are not just knee-jerk reactions, or reflections of wounded communal pride. The IRA, after all, has stubbornly refused to hand over its weapons, because it cannot bear the suggestion of a symbolic surrender. Having made that hugely important concession, we cannot expect the Unionists meekly to abandon their own symbols.

      "bodyText": "Cardinal Thomas Winning has re-entered the row over section 28 by sending a letter of support to Stagecoach millionaire, Brian Souter, praising his \"courage\" and his efforts to stage a referendum on the issue. The leader of Scotland's Roman Catholics, who has been outspoken in his condemnation of efforts to repeal the clause, had been urged by some officials in the church to pull back from the controversy. His letter to Mr Souter is his first intervention in the referendum debate. In it, he said Mr Souter had the gratitude of \"the silent majority of Scots who have been able to make their voice heard thanks to your intervention. \"It must now be clear to the politicians that any repeal of section 28 will be carried out in outright defiance of the will of the people of Scotland.\" A spokesman for the cardinal said the letter was intended as a gesture of solidarity \"from one Christian to another\".",

      "bodyText": "Film censors today failed in their High Court battle to ban the sale of explicit hardcore pornographic videos in licensed sex shops. A High Court judge dismissed the British Board of Film Classification's test case challenge against the decision of its own Video Appeals Committee to permit seven \"extremely explicit\" videos to go on sale. Mr Justice Hooper, sitting in London, ruled that the appeals committee was entitled to conclude \"that the risk (of the videos in question) being viewed by and causing harm to children or young persons is, on present evidence, insignificant\". The judge said that that was a finding \"that a reasonable decision-maker\" could reach. Lord Lester of Herne Hill QC, for the BBFC, argued during the recent hearing that, unless its legal challenge was successful, all hardcore porn videos would have to be classified for sale in sex shops for home use, unless they were criminally obscene or it could be proved that their sale and use \"will cause devastating harm to more than a minority of children and young people\". The case raised an issue \"of considerable public importance as regards the correct approach to the classification of hardcore pornographic videos intended for home viewing\", he said. It concerned the proper construction of the 1984 Video Recordings Act, as amended by the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. He argued that the appeal committee's view of the law was fatally flawed, and frustrated a statutory policy which stressed the need to protect children against being harmed by unnecessary exposure to pornographic videos which they might come across in the home. But the judge disagreed, saying the appeal committee had carried out \"a balancing exercise\" and properly assessed the risk to children, and that there was no error of law. The board brought the case to clarify the law prior to drawing up guidelines for the video industry. This led it to the unusual step of challenging its own committee, the members of which, including the writers Fay Weldon and Nina Bawden, decided by a majority last August to allow appeals by distributors Sheptonhurst Ltd and Prime Time (Shifnal) Ltd against BBFC refusals to give R18 classifications to the seven videos. The films were: Horny Catbabe, Nympho Nurse Nancy, TV Sex, Office Tart, Carnival International Version (Trailer), Wet Nurses 2 Continental Version and Miss Nude International Continental Version. The R18 certificates, which allow the videos to be sold to adults in sex shops, are still being withheld pending the outcome of today's judgment. Immediately after the ruling Mr David Pannick QC, appearing for Sheptonhurst, publicly called on the censors to issue the certificates now. The BBFC was refused leave to appeal, but could still ask the Court of Appeal to consider the case. Clive Sullivan, a consultant to Sheptonhurst Ltd, said afterwards that the decision did not \"unleash the floodgates\". \"It does make quite clear that there are still limits to be applied. \"It's just perhaps that the limits are slightly different to those applied previously.\" He denied that the ruling relaxed the rules on pornography that children might see, but said it applied to pornography that adults were permitted to buy. \"There are a few irresponsible adults in this country who permit children to have cigarettes and alcohol and perhaps some who permit children to see videos that are not appropriate for them. \"But we don't ban alcohol and cigarettes because of the irresponsible behaviour of a small minority.\" Greg Hurlston, director of Prime Time, based in Telford, Shropshire, said he was \"delighted\" that the High Court had come down in favour of the appeals committee. He said the videos were \"double X\" films showing penetration but not ejaculation. There were no close-ups and it was consensual sex. Today's ruling did not mean that European companies would now start distributing extreme hardcore porn in Britain.",

The Department of Transport confirmed that the Air Accidents Investigation Branch was looking into the incident last month when an incoming British Airways Boeing 747 is believed to have been within a moment of smashing into a British Midlands Airbus A321, which was taking off. The 747's landing was aborted and the two aircraft were understood to have just missed each other at around 3.06pm on April 28. A British Midland spokeswoman said: \"Our plane was cleared for take off and the BA Boeing was cleared to land.

According to radio reports, the Heathrow air traffic controller responsible for the planes' movements was reported to be a trainee being overseen by a mentor. London's congested skies are set to become more so, according to a British Air Transport Association report which today predicted that within five years demand for flights at Heathrow and Gatwick will outstrip capacity by more than 18m passengers a year.

But residents and environmental groups are opposed to increasing the number of flights from the airports, as well as the controversial plans to build Heathrow Terminal 5. The European Court of Human Rights is set to rule today on whether local campaigners are justified in calling on government to cut night flights into Heathrow. If the campaign is successful, it could lead to challenges against the government from communities under flight paths at other UK airports. The court case is being brought by eight residents who are all members of the Heathrow Association for Control of Aircraft Noise ClearSkies group. John Stewart, the group's spokesperson, criticised the calls for more flights from London. \"It is particularly unimaginative to call for 'more Heathrow' and 'more Gatwick',\" he said. \"We need to look at where new airports could be put in the south-east - on the coast, for example, where planes wouldn't fly over people's homes.\" An aviation spokesman for the Department of the Environment said the government was preparing a white paper on aviation and airports, but this was being held up while ministers await the findings of the independent inquiry into Terminal 5.

The Daily Mail reports that Celta Vigo are lining up an unlikely \u00a34m move for Christian Dailly - one of eight players told by Graeme Souness that they have no future at Blackburn Rovers. The Mail also claims that Marseille midfielder Robert Pires is ready to join Arsenal in a \u00a36m deal and that Liverpool will sign Leicester's reserve keeper Peggy Arphexad by the end of the week.

      "bodyText": "A plan to keep the Millennium Dome open after 2000, adding more zones and Disney-style attractions, will be one of two bids for the structure's future unveiled today. Dome Europe, backed by the Japanese Bank Nomura, is front runner to win the \"legacy competition\" launched by the government to attract bidders to take over the dome after the present exhibition completes its run. The shortlist, also thought to include Dome Legacy - a bid which would abandon the present zones and attractions in favour of a new \"development of living and working space\" - is being published by the government's regeneration agency, English Partnerships, amid fresh alarm over the precarious financial state of the dome. The shadow culture secretary, Peter Ainsworth, yesterday said the attraction should close at the end of this summer unless it could solve its continuing cash crisis without requiring yet more national lottery money. The early closure suggestion was swiftly dismissed as \"not an option\" by Mike O'Connor, director of the millennium commission, which allocates funding to the dome. However, some commissioners are understood to be furious at the expected further government bail-out of the project with more lottery money, only three months after the New Millennium Experience Company, the dome's operator, asked for an additional \u00a360m loan. The company has now acknowledged that, despite claims it could attract 12m visitors, the maximum total could fall as low as seven million or less. NMEC's chief executive, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, is in discussions with the millennium commission about further funding. Despite the private doubts which many ministers have held about the dome they have remained publicly loyal. But the success of the Tate Modern, on top of the popularity of the London Eye, has made Labour MPs uneasy and Tories keen to go for the kill. Mr Ainsworth yesterday predicted that, despite his calls for early closure, the dome would stay open for the planned full year because Mr Blair's personal association with the project created a \"political imperative\" to seek to make a success of the venture. Leaders of the Dome Europe consortium believe they can run the dome at a profit on a plan based on the present arrangement of zones and live acrobatics, despite the fact that the attraction is regularly failing to get near its daily target of 35,000 visitors. The bid, led by the Football League chairman, Peter Middleton, would see the introduction of at least two new zones in 2001 with more to follow in 2002-3, a rolling programme of Europe-themed shows and events, and an adventure playground for younger children. The successful bidder for the dome will pay around \u00a3100m for a 999-year lease on the 50-acre site, with the government insisting that the winner runs a leisure attraction on the site for a set period.",

The authors agree that hundreds of black people nevertheless died of starvation or from Boer bullets during the evacuation attempt.</p> <p>But they add: \"These were not the actions of a war criminal.\" Even Baden-Powell's critics in the garrison gave him credit for his \"extensive remedial measures\". There was also no clear evidence that the commander, who later married and had three children, was even a repressed homosexual.</p> <p>The writers, Edmund Yorke and Malcolm Flower-Smith of the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, base their defence on what they say is the fullest study and analysis so far made of diaries kept by garrison soldiers and civilians during the siege. \"Other writers have used these selectively to attack him,\" Dr Yorke said yesterday.</p> <p>Their sources include Baden-Powell's staff diaries, which show he started the evacuations after getting a \"bombshell\" telegram on February 8 1900 from the British commander, Lord Kitchener, indicating that Mafeking could not be relieved for four months.</p> <p>Baden-Powell had based garrison rations on a prospect of relief within two months. Kitchener ordered him to \"send as many women and children and natives as possible away\" to save rations.</p> <p>But the authors say the papers indicate that this harsh policy was not aimed at the township's 7,000-strong majority of blacks, the Baralong tribe, who were valued soldiers and boosted food stocks by rustling Boer cattle. Its victims were 2,000 \"outside Africans\", including Shangaans.</p> <p>Their food rations in Mafeking were cut off. Baden-Powell negotiated safe passage for them with the besieging Boers to British-held territory, supplying a military escort and food wagon. But the truce was broken.</p> <p>The first attempt to drive 900 blacks out at night was scattered by Boer snipers. The second, by day, saw them \"decimated\" by Boer attacks. \"The policy of forced evacuation was a blunder,\" Dr Yorke said. \"Baden-Powell was the reluctant victim of external military imperatives. He realised his errors and dropped it.\"</p> <p>Starvation among Shangaans intensified. Emerson Neilly, a journalist from the Pall Mall Gazette, wrote in his diary: \"I saw them fall down on the veldt and lie where they had fallen. The sufferers ... were mostly little boys ... probably hundreds died.\"</p> <p>But by March Baden-Powell had soup kitchens running. One of his most severe critics in the garrison conceded: \"No one now need starve.\" The book says his food distribution undoubtedly remained biased towards Europeans and the Baralong black elite, who showed no concern for the Shangaans. \"But he was no more racially prejudiced than the vast majority of his generation.\"</p> <p>Dr Yorke said: \"We don't want to portray him as an angel, but he was not a racialist or a war criminal. The siege was a progressive learning process for him. He was obsessed with defending the town. In the early stages he left rationing to subordinates, who behaved badly.</p> <p>\"Our account of the siege is fuller than in any previous book. In some cases previous authors have ignored some of the material with a view to denigrating Baden-Powell's policies. We have brought out the meetings he held to try to remedy the situation.\"</p> <p>Of allegations about Baden-Powell's \"confused sexuality\", the book says his concern about Boy McLaren was influenced by his role as the captured soldier's senior regimental officer as well as by friendship. His diaries expressed the same concern for McLaren as for all the wounded in the Boer hospital.</p> <p>And his aborted rescue plan was \"exactly the kind of exciting lone adventure\" that would have appealed to the founder of scouting.</p> <p>\"There is no evidence of improper conduct,\" said Mr Flower-Smith.</p> <p>Mafeking: the story of a siege, Covos-Day Books, \u00a310.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.pinetreeweb.com/B-P.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Dedicated Baden-Powell site</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.scoutbase.org.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">ScoutBase UK</a></p>",

Their book, which sets out to rehabilitate his character, counts as one of the most timely rescue operations in British imperial studies. For it is to be published on the 100th anniversary of what was once regarded as Baden-Powell's most significant moment: the relief of Mafeking. The defeat of a nine-month Afrikaner siege of the British garrison that he led in the small South African town during the Boer war prompted three days of street celebrations in London. On the crest of this fame Baden-Powell - until then an unimportant colonel aged 44 - went on to found the worldwide scout movement and become a revered model for youth. But since the 1960s his prestige has been weakened by a battery of books which accuse him of saving the white garrison only by imposing a racist \"leave or starve\" policy on its black members, causing hundreds of deaths. One South African historian, Pat Hopkins, said last year: \"This can only be described as a crime against humanity for which he deserves to be reappraised as a war criminal.\" Other studies have said he was distracted from his duties by infatuation with Kenneth \"Boy\" McLaren, a handsome young fellow polo-playing and pig-sticking officer. Colleagues had to stop him from riding single-handedly to the rescue when McLaren was captured by the Boers. But the new book finds that Baden-Powell was an indisputably brilliant soldier whose mass evacuation policy was a blunder under great pressure - \"the product of naivete and misjudgment rather than any concept of premeditated murder\".

But they add: \"These were not the actions of a war criminal.\" Even Baden-Powell's critics in the garrison gave him credit for his \"extensive remedial measures\". There was also no clear evidence that the commander, who later married and had three children, was even a repressed homosexual. The writers, Edmund Yorke and Malcolm Flower-Smith of the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, base their defence on what they say is the fullest study and analysis so far made of diaries kept by garrison soldiers and civilians during the siege. \"Other writers have used these selectively to attack him,\" Dr Yorke said yesterday. Their sources include Baden-Powell's staff diaries, which show he started the evacuations after getting a \"bombshell\" telegram on February 8 1900 from the British commander, Lord Kitchener, indicating that Mafeking could not be relieved for four months. Baden-Powell had based garrison rations on a prospect of relief within two months. Kitchener ordered him to \"send as many women and children and natives as possible away\" to save rations. But the authors say the papers indicate that this harsh policy was not aimed at the township's 7,000-strong majority of blacks, the Baralong tribe, who were valued soldiers and boosted food stocks by rustling Boer cattle. Its victims were 2,000 \"outside Africans\", including Shangaans. Their food rations in Mafeking were cut off. Baden-Powell negotiated safe passage for them with the besieging Boers to British-held territory, supplying a military escort and food wagon. But the truce was broken. The first attempt to drive 900 blacks out at night was scattered by Boer snipers. The second, by day, saw them \"decimated\" by Boer attacks. \"The policy of forced evacuation was a blunder,\" Dr Yorke said. \"Baden-Powell was the reluctant victim of external military imperatives. He realised his errors and dropped it.\" Starvation among Shangaans intensified. Emerson Neilly, a journalist from the Pall Mall Gazette, wrote in his diary: \"I saw them fall down on the veldt and lie where they had fallen. The sufferers ... were mostly little boys ... probably hundreds died.\" But by March Baden-Powell had soup kitchens running. One of his most severe critics in the garrison conceded: \"No one now need starve.\" The book says his food distribution undoubtedly remained biased towards Europeans and the Baralong black elite, who showed no concern for the Shangaans. \"But he was no more racially prejudiced than the vast majority of his generation.\" Dr Yorke said: \"We don't want to portray him as an angel, but he was not a racialist or a war criminal. The siege was a progressive learning process for him. He was obsessed with defending the town. In the early stages he left rationing to subordinates, who behaved badly. \"Our account of the siege is fuller than in any previous book. In some cases previous authors have ignored some of the material with a view to denigrating Baden-Powell's policies. We have brought out the meetings he held to try to remedy the situation.\" Of allegations about Baden-Powell's \"confused sexuality\", the book says his concern about Boy McLaren was influenced by his role as the captured soldier's senior regimental officer as well as by friendship. His diaries expressed the same concern for McLaren as for all the wounded in the Boer hospital. And his aborted rescue plan was \"exactly the kind of exciting lone adventure\" that would have appealed to the founder of scouting. \"There is no evidence of improper conduct,\" said Mr Flower-Smith.

That is the phrase the new National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (Nesta) is hanging around the necks of the 13 \"fellows\" whose names it will announce today. Each of them will be paid to think - in Paulin's case \u00a375,000 over three years. It sounds almost too good to be true and is the antithesis of the Thatcherite notion that all cultural activity should have an economic pay-off. </p> <p>\"Fellowships are designed to help people pursue ideas and fulfil their potential, particularly individuals whose best work still lies ahead of them,\" says Nesta. It has an endowment of \u00a3200m, courtesy of the lottery, and will use the interest to shell out \u00a310m a year to artists, writers, scientists, engineers, film-makers, inventors, anyone who can make a good case for needing cash to help them to develop their ideas. </p> <p>The way fellows are chosen is shadowy: 100 \"independent\" (and unnamed) nominators put forward candidates who are then invited to apply via the Nesta website. Paulin has no idea who nominated him, or how they knew he was struggling to combine writing an epic poem based on the second world war with his work as an English lecturer at Oxford. But know they did, and the grant will enable him to reduce his teaching commitments and devote some serious time to the poem. </p> <p>Nesta, perhaps wary of what the Daily Mail might make of its largesse (\u00a3200m is, after all, a lot of nurses or school textbooks), is keen to play up the practical side of the Pauline vision: \"He will undertake an intense period of research and experimentation to develop the new project, which Tom describes as 'affirming the struggle and memory of the generation - my parents' generation - that fought in the second world war, and to do so before the doors of living memory are closed on it.' Tom will draw on photography, film and music to create radical new poetic forms and styles aimed at extending the boundaries of our current notions of poetry.\" </p> <p>Paulin has a less concrete conception of the project, and would never be so immodest as to claim that he was extending the boundaries of poetry. \"It's an almost Jamesian idea,\" says Paulin. \"Go and be Lambert Strether [Paulin hopes and expects you will have read The Ambassadors]; get out of the managerial bureaucracy you're stuck in and go to Paris, hang about, look at some paintings. Part of trying to write is what Hazlitt calls indolence, hanging about waiting for something.\" </p> <p>When I met Paulin in his cosy, book-strewn room at Hertford College he had just delivered two one-hour lectures (one on a theme close to his heart - political readings of Keats's To Autumn). And we had to stop after an hour and a half because there were three undergraduates skulking in the stairwell waiting for his thoughts on Blake. </p> <p>An hour and a half is no time at all with Paulin because his method of exegesis, like his poetry, is highly associative and extremely demanding; his wonderful, cawing voice is also prone to high-pitched hesitation; he is an impressionist's dream. Nesta may have got a succinct summation of his war poem, but I didn't. \"I want to write a long poem about the second world war, from the beginning, which is the Versailles peace conference in 1919. I'm nervous about talking about it - partly out of superstition, partly because you worry about taking yourself too seriously - and I'm worried about it because it sounds a monstrous project.\" </p> <p>Reading between the lines, and the pauses, I think Paulin - a Northern Irish Protestant who supports republicanism and thinks it inevitable that the north will leave the UK - intends to do something quite fascinating: write a poem in praise of the collective effort of the British people in the second world war, a people who for six years were united in their will to protect freedom and defeat fascism. As Britain bickers over devolution, argues over the EU, frets about identity, he will celebrate a moment of national unity. \"I'm worried that in British culture there's a fixation on the first world war, which is to do with a sense of loss, whereas if the British were to talk about the second world war more, maybe a sort of triumphalism would enter. British culture is resistant to that.\" </p> <p>It is odd that someone who looks forward to Northern Ireland leaving the union wants to encourage triumphalism, but his point is a subtle one: countries must have a sense of nationhood, so let it be a generous patriotism -\"the patriotism you see in Blake and Cobbett, Hazlitt and Orwell, which is a very strong part of this country's culture\" - rather than a narrow-minded, bigoted, destructive insularity. \"I have thought a lot about the new English nationalism as the old idea of Britain starts to break up, which is what I grew up with in the north of Ireland,\" he says. \"I'm worried about the new English identity. If it isn't inclusive, if it's like the Countryside Alliance, that worries me.\" </p> <p>There is a tension in Paulin's attitude that bodes well for his poem: he wants to celebrate the second world war as \"the peak of British history\" while recognising that it was also the beginning of the end for Britain as a world power and as a country with a sure sense of itself as a nation. Now it is a collection of regions which may face a federal future. \"Things have to change with the north of Ireland moving out of the union and maybe Scotland,\" says Paulin, \"but I have a lot of sympathy with John Major's speech where he said that Scotland's independence would impoverish the overall culture.\" </p> <p>Paulin, who is 51, has described himself as a failed historian - \"growing up in Ireland, you're imbued with history\" - and this new poem will call on his historical, as well as his literary, sensitivity. His historically and politically charged readings of texts (notably his view of Ulysses as an attack on colonialism) are powerful, and in everything he writes - poetry, criticism, essays, literary biography - an urgency and engagement shine through. He is the opposite of the ivory towers don: he is down there in the grimy basement, scratching vital messages on the walls. </p> <p>Paulin, like all poets, is in love with words, but also in love with their power - to dazzle, damage and demand change. Milton was his beginning. \"Milton is this extraordinary combination of great artist and great polemicist, whereas the two activities have since been split, often by literary critics with an axe to grind which they are concealing under the idea of art as being above politics.\" </p> <p>Paulin's engagement takes him in many directions: a fine book on Hazlitt that took him six years and has helped to reclaim his hero for a new generation; poetry that has never ducked the politics of Northern Ireland, even when its absentee writer has been told he no longer has the right to comment; and those rottweiler-like appearances on the BBC's tokenistic arts-crit shows (currently Review - the periodic name changes suggest deep cultural insecurity over at White City). </p> <p>In the course of our one and a half hours this most benign and charming of men (he had bought me a baguette - slightly squashed - in anticipation of my being hungry) managed three sudden outbursts, when the voice rose another couple of octaves and the spirit of Swift, who thought it his duty to be vexatious, possessed him. </p> <p>One: apropos of working on Review. \"It's great fun working with people younger than yourself, and sometimes you are left alone with Jackson Pollock's paintings or Monet's Water Lilies - that's amazing. Though you also have to sit through the most terrible things, like that Frank Skinner play with the tortoise - that's the worst night in the theatre I've ever had.\" </p> <p>Two: apropos of Kingsley Amis. \"Jesus Christ, what an overrated talent Kingsley Amis was. I have just been dipping into his letters, which are absolutely awful. There are wonderful passages in Larkin's letters; they are real letters, whereas Amis's are just like watching some drunkard hit his head against a gas fire.\" </p> <p>Three: apropos of my suggesting that his attack on Anthony Thwaite - \" a little balsawood minor man of letters\" - was over the top. \"I was very, very, very, very angry at the way he edited Larkin's letters; I was extremely angry at the reception of the letters. Larkin's racism was tolerated, just as Eliot's anti- semitism has been tolerated. The point I was trying to make was what even filthier racist remarks has Thwaite cut, and I was very angry. My children are mixed race [he is married to a woman of Indian descent], and more or less every day I hear some story. I'm very angry about that sort of institutional tolerance of racism.\" </p> <p>Paulin is very angry (often to the power of four) and anxious about a lot of things. \"He is one of the great disagree-ers,\" said the poet Christopher Reid, his former editor at Faber. \"Going against the grain seems to give him a kind of energy.\" Yet, in person, it is his passion, not his anger, that stands out; vexatiousness, not bitterness, that drives his feuds. He lives for his writing - and for the writers he loves. They are living presences, there to be reclaimed. He opposes canonical literature, celebrates the vernacular, is committed to democracy in politics and literature. He is the most engaged and engaging of men. Truly, an amazing person.</p>",

His historically and politically charged readings of texts (notably his view of Ulysses as an attack on colonialism) are powerful, and in everything he writes - poetry, criticism, essays, literary biography - an urgency and engagement shine through. He is the opposite of the ivory towers don: he is down there in the grimy basement, scratching vital messages on the walls. Paulin, like all poets, is in love with words, but also in love with their power - to dazzle, damage and demand change. Milton was his beginning. \"Milton is this extraordinary combination of great artist and great polemicist, whereas the two activities have since been split, often by literary critics with an axe to grind which they are concealing under the idea of art as being above politics.\" Paulin's engagement takes him in many directions: a fine book on Hazlitt that took him six years and has helped to reclaim his hero for a new generation; poetry that has never ducked the politics of Northern Ireland, even when its absentee writer has been told he no longer has the right to comment; and those rottweiler-like appearances on the BBC's tokenistic arts-crit shows (currently Review - the periodic name changes suggest deep cultural insecurity over at White City). In the course of our one and a half hours this most benign and charming of men (he had bought me a baguette - slightly squashed - in anticipation of my being hungry) managed three sudden outbursts, when the voice rose another couple of octaves and the spirit of Swift, who thought it his duty to be vexatious, possessed him. One: apropos of working on Review. \"It's great fun working with people younger than yourself, and sometimes you are left alone with Jackson Pollock's paintings or Monet's Water Lilies - that's amazing. Though you also have to sit through the most terrible things, like that Frank Skinner play with the tortoise - that's the worst night in the theatre I've ever had.\" Two: apropos of Kingsley Amis. \"Jesus Christ, what an overrated talent Kingsley Amis was. I have just been dipping into his letters, which are absolutely awful. There are wonderful passages in Larkin's letters; they are real letters, whereas Amis's are just like watching some drunkard hit his head against a gas fire.\" Three: apropos of my suggesting that his attack on Anthony Thwaite - \" a little balsawood minor man of letters\" - was over the top. \"I was very, very, very, very angry at the way he edited Larkin's letters; I was extremely angry at the reception of the letters. Larkin's racism was tolerated, just as Eliot's anti- semitism has been tolerated. The point I was trying to make was what even filthier racist remarks has Thwaite cut, and I was very angry. My children are mixed race [he is married to a woman of Indian descent], and more or less every day I hear some story. I'm very angry about that sort of institutional tolerance of racism.\" Paulin is very angry (often to the power of four) and anxious about a lot of things. \"He is one of the great disagree-ers,\" said the poet Christopher Reid, his former editor at Faber. \"Going against the grain seems to give him a kind of energy.\" Yet, in person, it is his passion, not his anger, that stands out; vexatiousness, not bitterness, that drives his feuds. He lives for his writing - and for the writers he loves. They are living presences, there to be reclaimed. He opposes canonical literature, celebrates the vernacular, is committed to democracy in politics and literature. He is the most engaged and engaging of men. Truly, an amazing person.",

      "body": "<p>Set in a parallel world, but taking a good swipe at some of the values that prevail in our own society, The Wind Singer is a potent mix of thundering adventure and purposeful fantasy. </p> <p>From infancy, the people of Aramanth go before the examiners for regular assessment, and their quality of life is ruthlessly determined by the ratings they achieve. When Kestrel, the spirited young heroine, rebels against this soulless system she's in big trouble. There's no future for those who defy authority - they are referred for what is euphemistically described as special teaching. But Kestrel escapes, and with her twin brother sets off on a very different learning curve, a dangerous quest to deliver the people of Aramanth from this sinister regime. </p> <p>Although The Wind Singer is full of unforgettable, eye-stretching imagery and startling, often savage, use of metaphor, the jacket design is a subtle masterpiece of understatement. \"I don't want illustrations,\" says Nicholson firmly, \"I want readers to use their imaginations... and that's why, although there's been a lot of interest, I'm refusing to sell the film rights until all three books have been published, and the children of at least one generation have formed their own pictures.\"</p> <p>It's a bold approach: you would not guess that this is Nicholson's first children's book. At 52, he has stepped sideways into children's literature from a hugely successful career as a Hollywood screen writer - his credits range from Shadowlands (1993) to the new Ridley Scott blockbuster, Gladiator. And though the film is only just released, it's the book that is uppermost in his mind - and he awaits its reception with an engaging blend of optimism and apprehension - or, as he himself so disarmingly puts it, \"a mixture of ridiculous arrogance and trembling insecurity\". (He's a master of the self-deprecating aside.) </p> <p>So what inspired him to write for children? To date, his earnings from this trilogy, published in five languages, scarcely equal one week's pay as a screenwriter, so it can't be the money. </p> <p>I talk to Nicholson at his home in Sussex, an idyllic spot (as far from Hollywood as it is from Aramanth) where he lives with his wife Virginia (also a writer) and their three young children. Full of light and colour, their converted farmhouse is an impressive and perhaps rare blend of domestic order and creative energy. Virginia is the daughter of Quentin Bell - her grandmother was Virginia Woolf's sister, the painter Vanessa Bell, so it's perhaps not surprising to find the little Nicholson girls busy with paint-brushes - merrily decorating their own arms and legs in a style not unlike that of the Omega workshop. </p> <p>Family life has been a major source of inspiration for The Wind Singer, and Nicholson writes about it with tenderness and perception. The story centres on the resilience of a family bond that's stretched to the limit, and character development is an important part of the plot. \"As a parent, I've read a lot of current children's fiction, which often seems too rich in invention, at the expense of character.\" </p> <p>He relished the opportunity to create \"another world, \"an imaginary place that exists on its own terms... and it had to be for children. Writing it for adults, I'd have automatically been steered towards science fiction, and I didn't want that. Nor did I want to find myself trying to be too clever. As with all eight of my early, failed novels [for adults] - they were far too intricate and over-written. So I thought I would side-step all that by simply writing 'a tale'. The result is a complete mess of stuff that boiled up inside me. I just went with it; a bit like therapy, I suppose.\" </p> <p>And of all the bizarre, surreal images that emerge, in a landscape that unfolds with cinematic breadth, perhaps the most disturbing is the marching army of \"Zars\" - beautiful, baton-twirling, teenage killers, doomed to eternal youth: they were inspired by a weird combination of his own teenage obsession with American youth, and cheerleaders (\"to me, banged up in a Catholic boarding school, it all seemed so cool, so sexy\") and the tragic events at Columbine High School. </p> <p>He can't pinpoint the origins of the happy, sensual \"mud people\" - a brilliantly imagined underclass who live in the bowels of the city - but talking about them somehow leads him to describe how he once heroically unclogged a cesspit. \"It's odd, when you think about it, how people are so scared of excrement,\" he muses. </p> <p>The book is full of surprises - \"I was anxious to maintain a level of energy and excitement. I've got a very controlling mind and what I enjoyed here was the muddle of it all. It was so liberating to be free of the constraints of the film world - the stars, the length, the budget... and it was all mine! But every story needs a driving force - look at Dahl, and the passion and resentment that drive his stories. What drove my story was the great weight of anger I found in myself about the needless stress put on children today by the relentless tests and examinations.\" </p> <p>The tyranny of the exam system is something Nicholson probably knows better than most - he's the product of prep school, public school and Cambridge, where he got a double first. His own children attend a private school, where common entrance exams necessitate tests every week. \"We've had some vigorous discussions about that! But competition is fine as long as you are competing against yourself, rather than other people. But I think there's increasing confusion about what we want schools to do - in general, exams just serve to standardise the product, with children endlessly absorbing and regurgitating irrelevant information. </p> <p>\"And there's such snobbery about vocational training. I think the notion of education from five to 18 will give way to a more flexible system. Computers are changing everything, you'll have kids of 14 starting their own companies... then at 17, choosing, say, to learn Latin; and at 29 exploring astronomy. School will no longer be a form of social containment for the young. And misfits will no longer be driven to become the aggressors of society.\" </p> <p>Paradoxically, as he proposes this radical loosening-up of our education system, he takes on the air of a traditional, tub-thumping headmaster, outlining his prospectus with single-minded fervour. </p> <p>\"Maybe I shouldn't criticise the system, but it sometimes takes an outsider to see sense... and that's the great privilege one has in writing fiction - you don't have to be an expert!\" </p> <p>But he certainly has expertise in structuring a story, a skill well honed by his screenwriting. \"Structure is vital to fantasy. I've just had to turn down the opportunity of writing the new Superman film - I was sorry, because that's a very well realised concept, with well-defined limits. Fantasy has to have limits and you have to declare them, so readers know what characters can and can't do - otherwise, if anything can happen, the story is over.\" </p> <p>He's now on book three of his trilogy and talks about it with visionary zeal, constantly racing to the story's horizon to bring back news of what's going on there. As creator of this parallel world, how does it feel to be responsible for resolving all the ethical, intellectual and practical issues involved? \"I'm pedalling hard to keep up!\" he laughs, \"but you must understand, this is a story! Not a thesis, not a complete theosophical system. I'm no Jonathan Swift!\" </p> <p>Because of Shadowlands, it's tempting to look for echoes of Narnia in The Wind Singer. Has CS Lewis been an influence? \"Like anyone, I'm the product of everything I've seen and read. Obviously, when I was writing Shadowlands, I read CS Lewis with enormous care. And, yes, he was an influence to the extent that there was this thoughtful and intelligent man actually choosing to write for children - and the fact that his work continues to give such joy validates the enterprise, and, yes, makes him a role model. But, I have to admit, I never quite liked the Narnia books.

      "bodyText": "Set in a parallel world, but taking a good swipe at some of the values that prevail in our own society, The Wind Singer is a potent mix of thundering adventure and purposeful fantasy. From infancy, the people of Aramanth go before the examiners for regular assessment, and their quality of life is ruthlessly determined by the ratings they achieve. When Kestrel, the spirited young heroine, rebels against this soulless system she's in big trouble. There's no future for those who defy authority - they are referred for what is euphemistically described as special teaching. But Kestrel escapes, and with her twin brother sets off on a very different learning curve, a dangerous quest to deliver the people of Aramanth from this sinister regime. Although The Wind Singer is full of unforgettable, eye-stretching imagery and startling, often savage, use of metaphor, the jacket design is a subtle masterpiece of understatement. \"I don't want illustrations,\" says Nicholson firmly, \"I want readers to use their imaginations... and that's why, although there's been a lot of interest, I'm refusing to sell the film rights until all three books have been published, and the children of at least one generation have formed their own pictures.\" It's a bold approach: you would not guess that this is Nicholson's first children's book. At 52, he has stepped sideways into children's literature from a hugely successful career as a Hollywood screen writer - his credits range from Shadowlands (1993) to the new Ridley Scott blockbuster, Gladiator. And though the film is only just released, it's the book that is uppermost in his mind - and he awaits its reception with an engaging blend of optimism and apprehension - or, as he himself so disarmingly puts it, \"a mixture of ridiculous arrogance and trembling insecurity\". (He's a master of the self-deprecating aside.) So what inspired him to write for children? To date, his earnings from this trilogy, published in five languages, scarcely equal one week's pay as a screenwriter, so it can't be the money. I talk to Nicholson at his home in Sussex, an idyllic spot (as far from Hollywood as it is from Aramanth) where he lives with his wife Virginia (also a writer) and their three young children. Full of light and colour, their converted farmhouse is an impressive and perhaps rare blend of domestic order and creative energy. Virginia is the daughter of Quentin Bell - her grandmother was Virginia Woolf's sister, the painter Vanessa Bell, so it's perhaps not surprising to find the little Nicholson girls busy with paint-brushes - merrily decorating their own arms and legs in a style not unlike that of the Omega workshop. Family life has been a major source of inspiration for The Wind Singer, and Nicholson writes about it with tenderness and perception. The story centres on the resilience of a family bond that's stretched to the limit, and character development is an important part of the plot. \"As a parent, I've read a lot of current children's fiction, which often seems too rich in invention, at the expense of character.\" He relished the opportunity to create \"another world, \"an imaginary place that exists on its own terms... and it had to be for children. Writing it for adults, I'd have automatically been steered towards science fiction, and I didn't want that. Nor did I want to find myself trying to be too clever. As with all eight of my early, failed novels [for adults] - they were far too intricate and over-written. So I thought I would side-step all that by simply writing 'a tale'. The result is a complete mess of stuff that boiled up inside me. I just went with it; a bit like therapy, I suppose.\" And of all the bizarre, surreal images that emerge, in a landscape that unfolds with cinematic breadth, perhaps the most disturbing is the marching army of \"Zars\" - beautiful, baton-twirling, teenage killers, doomed to eternal youth: they were inspired by a weird combination of his own teenage obsession with American youth, and cheerleaders (\"to me, banged up in a Catholic boarding school, it all seemed so cool, so sexy\") and the tragic events at Columbine High School. He can't pinpoint the origins of the happy, sensual \"mud people\" - a brilliantly imagined underclass who live in the bowels of the city - but talking about them somehow leads him to describe how he once heroically unclogged a cesspit. \"It's odd, when you think about it, how people are so scared of excrement,\" he muses. The book is full of surprises - \"I was anxious to maintain a level of energy and excitement. I've got a very controlling mind and what I enjoyed here was the muddle of it all. It was so liberating to be free of the constraints of the film world - the stars, the length, the budget... and it was all mine! But every story needs a driving force - look at Dahl, and the passion and resentment that drive his stories. What drove my story was the great weight of anger I found in myself about the needless stress put on children today by the relentless tests and examinations.\" The tyranny of the exam system is something Nicholson probably knows better than most - he's the product of prep school, public school and Cambridge, where he got a double first. His own children attend a private school, where common entrance exams necessitate tests every week. \"We've had some vigorous discussions about that! But competition is fine as long as you are competing against yourself, rather than other people. But I think there's increasing confusion about what we want schools to do - in general, exams just serve to standardise the product, with children endlessly absorbing and regurgitating irrelevant information. \"And there's such snobbery about vocational training. I think the notion of education from five to 18 will give way to a more flexible system. Computers are changing everything, you'll have kids of 14 starting their own companies... then at 17, choosing, say, to learn Latin; and at 29 exploring astronomy. School will no longer be a form of social containment for the young. And misfits will no longer be driven to become the aggressors of society.\" Paradoxically, as he proposes this radical loosening-up of our education system, he takes on the air of a traditional, tub-thumping headmaster, outlining his prospectus with single-minded fervour. \"Maybe I shouldn't criticise the system, but it sometimes takes an outsider to see sense... and that's the great privilege one has in writing fiction - you don't have to be an expert!\" But he certainly has expertise in structuring a story, a skill well honed by his screenwriting. \"Structure is vital to fantasy. I've just had to turn down the opportunity of writing the new Superman film - I was sorry, because that's a very well realised concept, with well-defined limits. Fantasy has to have limits and you have to declare them, so readers know what characters can and can't do - otherwise, if anything can happen, the story is over.\" He's now on book three of his trilogy and talks about it with visionary zeal, constantly racing to the story's horizon to bring back news of what's going on there. As creator of this parallel world, how does it feel to be responsible for resolving all the ethical, intellectual and practical issues involved? \"I'm pedalling hard to keep up!\" he laughs, \"but you must understand, this is a story! Not a thesis, not a complete theosophical system. I'm no Jonathan Swift!\" Because of Shadowlands, it's tempting to look for echoes of Narnia in The Wind Singer. Has CS Lewis been an influence? \"Like anyone, I'm the product of everything I've seen and read. Obviously, when I was writing Shadowlands, I read CS Lewis with enormous care. And, yes, he was an influence to the extent that there was this thoughtful and intelligent man actually choosing to write for children - and the fact that his work continues to give such joy validates the enterprise, and, yes, makes him a role model. But, I have to admit, I never quite liked the Narnia books. While I love it when you can see his imagination working full-tilt, I really dislike that sense of the wise old man talking 'de haut en bas', guiding the youngsters. I recognise in myself a tendency to pontificate, and it needs curbing! Maybe I'm just doing what I think he should have done.\" \u0095 The Wind Singer is part one of The Wind on Fire Trilogy, by William Nicholson. Published by Mammoth, \u00a312.99.",

Yet seemingly anyone with a pen and a pot of bile to dip it in is allowed to strut his stuff on the TV page. </p> <p>And what stuff! Among the most treasured relics in the office of the head of BBC comedy are copies of such reviews as \"One Foot In The Grave? One script in the bin!\" \"Absolutely Fabulous? Absolutely terrible!\" and a curt notice about the first episode of Fawlty Towers that went \"Long on John, short on jokes.\" All reviewed and dismissed after the first episode, naturally. </p> <p>Of course there are honourable exceptions: The Guardian's Nancy Banks-Smith, Joe Joseph at The Times, and the nomadic Jaci Stephen, for example, writers who seem to understand and even like television. But they are outnumbered by dyspeptic hacks. For whereas film critics delight in getting on set or into the cutting room, and music critics are barely a toggle away from an anorak in their love for their chosen art form, TV critics prefer to sit at home moaning, surrounded by half-viewed cassettes and half-eaten pizzas. </p> <p>Perhaps there's just no point reviewing something that has already happened and is never going to happen again. Yet when one national broadsheet abandoned reviews in favour of extensive previews, their readers didn't like it. Why not? Perhaps the best template for TV reviewing is to be found on the back page. After all, sports reporting is about trying to capture the past moment, even more than TV reviewing is. </p> <p>The hunger is there to read about the football match or the horse race you saw, in the flesh or on the television, and to see if a reporter who knows what he/she is talking about agrees or disagrees with your very own personal review of the game. Was the third goal offside? Did that horse look like someone had slipped a couple of \"E\"s in his nose bag? Did the challenger take a dive or was it a mismatch? </p> <p>Good sports reporting illuminates and enhances the enjoyment of the fan, especially the fan who didn't manage to see the event. Good sports reporters are defined by their knowledge and their love of what they write about, while our journalist friend Peter was once turned down for the TV critic's job on his national daily newspaper, after admitting that he liked watching the telly. </p> <p>So is there a role for television critics, or will they all have to go and get proper jobs? The answer is - more than ever before. For just around the corner lies the terrifying Pandora's box of TV on demand. Every programme ever made anywhere in the world will be available, down a wire into the hard drive sitting where your video recorder used to be. When you next read a glowing review of the next Marks and Gran comedy in The Guardian there'll be no need to grind your teeth because you were out for a takeaway sushi and missed it. Instead you'll be able to download at the press of a button and judge it for yourselves. Because ultimately, it's what the viewers think of a programme that really matters.</p>",

Yet seemingly anyone with a pen and a pot of bile to dip it in is allowed to strut his stuff on the TV page. And what stuff! Among the most treasured relics in the office of the head of BBC comedy are copies of such reviews as \"One Foot In The Grave? One script in the bin!\" \"Absolutely Fabulous? Absolutely terrible!\" and a curt notice about the first episode of Fawlty Towers that went \"Long on John, short on jokes.\" All reviewed and dismissed after the first episode, naturally. Of course there are honourable exceptions: The Guardian's Nancy Banks-Smith, Joe Joseph at The Times, and the nomadic Jaci Stephen, for example, writers who seem to understand and even like television. But they are outnumbered by dyspeptic hacks. For whereas film critics delight in getting on set or into the cutting room, and music critics are barely a toggle away from an anorak in their love for their chosen art form, TV critics prefer to sit at home moaning, surrounded by half-viewed cassettes and half-eaten pizzas. Perhaps there's just no point reviewing something that has already happened and is never going to happen again. Yet when one national broadsheet abandoned reviews in favour of extensive previews, their readers didn't like it. Why not? Perhaps the best template for TV reviewing is to be found on the back page. After all, sports reporting is about trying to capture the past moment, even more than TV reviewing is. The hunger is there to read about the football match or the horse race you saw, in the flesh or on the television, and to see if a reporter who knows what he/she is talking about agrees or disagrees with your very own personal review of the game. Was the third goal offside? Did that horse look like someone had slipped a couple of \"E\"s in his nose bag? Did the challenger take a dive or was it a mismatch? Good sports reporting illuminates and enhances the enjoyment of the fan, especially the fan who didn't manage to see the event. Good sports reporters are defined by their knowledge and their love of what they write about, while our journalist friend Peter was once turned down for the TV critic's job on his national daily newspaper, after admitting that he liked watching the telly. So is there a role for television critics, or will they all have to go and get proper jobs? The answer is - more than ever before. For just around the corner lies the terrifying Pandora's box of TV on demand. Every programme ever made anywhere in the world will be available, down a wire into the hard drive sitting where your video recorder used to be. When you next read a glowing review of the next Marks and Gran comedy in The Guardian there'll be no need to grind your teeth because you were out for a takeaway sushi and missed it. Instead you'll be able to download at the press of a button and judge it for yourselves. Because ultimately, it's what the viewers think of a programme that really matters.",

      "bodyText": "Far-reaching attemtps to tackle the European Union\u00eds chaotic aid programme will be launched today by Chris Patten, the EU external relations commissioner, in a bid to make Brussels a more efficient player on the world stage. The EU\u00ebs \u00a37 billion aid budget is the world\u00eds largest, but it has an appalling reputation for getting things done efficiently. It currently has more than \u00a314 billion in unpaid commitments. According to leaks of a report Mr Patten will present to fellow commissioners today, one of his most devastating findings was that the EU promised \u00a3120 million for re construction work in central America after Hurricane Mitch. Two years later, however, not a penny has been spent. Similar problems -some already well known- were found in Gaza, Bosnia and Tibet. Reconstruction in Kosovo, a major EU priority after last year\u00eds Nato-led bombing cam paign, has been impeded by wrangling over the use of all 11 community languages. Last week Mr Patten admitted he was \u00eb\u00edembarassed\u00ed\u00ed by the yawning gap between committments and delivery in the Balkans. Proposals to improve the situation include creating a new semi-autonomous agency cal lled Euraid - which Mr Patten hopes will become a globally-recognisable brand name - to set priorites and objectives and then manage projects. He wants staff working abroad to be able to make quick decisions without referring back to Brussels for micromanagement from afar. The hope is that eventually the EU can match the United States as a global player -though it will have to make unaminagable strides in common foreign and defence policies before that can be a realistic prospect. Other ideas include eliminating a backlog of 1,200 projects worth pounds one billion from before 1995 that have never been completed, or, in some cases even begun. Mr Patten, whose mnatra has become \u00eb\u00eddelivery delivery delivery,\u00ed\u00ed was horrifed to discover the state of the programme when he took over last September -and is determined to make his mark early on his five-year term. Diplomats in Brussels say it is unclear whether he can succeed. The external relations directorate of the commission is shot through with cumbersome working procedures and a great deal of duplication. Mr Patten has also been involved in behind the scvenes conflicts with Poul Nielsen, the acerbic Danish aid commissioner. It is no secret that Mr Patten, who came to Brussels after serving as governor of Hong Kong and investigating the RUC in Northern Ireland, has often been frustrated at the pace and methods of the Brussels bureaucracy.

At least he doesn't look like his self-portraits, in which bandages swathe his head, bent forks pull his mouth into a mocking smile and blood drenches his torso.

The artist Robert Crumb once said of him: \"Helnwein is a very fine artist and one sick motherfucker.\" </p> <p>He earned his first gallery show in the 70s by driving around his native Vienna dressed in Nazi uniform, his head bandaged, fake blood trickling from his mouth. It caught the eye of an art dealer who signed him up and has remained faithful to Austria's enfant terrible ever since. </p> <p> The decision to become an artist came to Helnwein \"in a split second\" at the age of 18, he says. \"I saw it as the only way to find answers to the questions that no one in Austria would give me, such as why the post-war republic portrayed itself as the first victim of the Nazis rather than as one of the main perpetrators.\" He enrolled at the Experimental Institute for Higher Graphic Instruction in Vienna, but soon got bored.

They attracted attention from everyone, from concentration camp victims to SS officers, most of whom opened up to him. Somehow neo-Nazis got to hear of his pictures, knocking at his studio door to say: \"We've heard you have a painting of the F\u00fchrer. Can we come in?\" According to Helnwein, they confided in him their dreams of German supremacy and told him how they were infiltrating the far-right Freedom Party.</p> <p> Now, Helnwein has clear opinions on J\u00f6rg Haider and his party's blitzschnell rise to government; but he seems typically wary of being labelled as having an anti-Haider agenda. \"I cannot understand why everyone makes so much fuss now,\" he says. \"The situation was far worse in the past, when the former Freedom Party leader [Friedrich Peter] was an SS soldier who had been involved in the exterminations. Everyone knew about it and it was well documented, but he always said \"I don't remember\" and everyone accepted that.\" </p> <p> But as with his repressive Roman Catholic upbringing, it seems that Helnwein, born in 1948, will never escape the Nazi theme (in fact, he sees the two traditions as inextricably linked). Spurred into action by an interview in an Austrian tabloid in which the country's top court psychiatrist, Dr Heinrich Gross, admitted killing children at Vienna's Am Spiegelgrund Paediatric Unit during the war by poisoning their food, Helnwein painted Life not Worth Living - a watercolour of a little girl \"asleep\" on the table, her head in her plate. The painting sparked a nationwide debate that finally led to Gross appearing before a Vienna court in March. The judge ruled Gross was mentally unfit to be tried.</p> <p> Outside the courtroom I met relatives of his alleged child victims, bearing photographs of them: their bellies distended from drug experimentation, their skulls clamped in head-measuring instruments. The brains of more than 400 of them ended up pickled in jars in the basement of the hospital where Gross experimented on them. Helnwein's first solo show in the UK consists largely of frail and tender formaldehyde-yellow or x-ray-blue images of pre-natal babies and children, reflecting the horror of the Nazi euthanasia programme, but brought close to the 21st century by the freshness of the Gross story. The huge portraits have been reworked from deformed teratological images from Austria's Anatomical Museum. </p> <p>Another exhibit, the Epiphany, shows uniformed Nazi soldiers inspecting a naked baby \"Jesus\" who is held by a beautiful Aryan goddess. The widow of one of the Nazi officers is suing Helnwein for the unauthorised use of the image of her husband. </p> <p> Children and child abuse have long been a central theme in Helnwein's work, \"years before anyone would dare talk about it,\" he says. The images of seemingly innocent children in compromising positions, with a threatening look of experience in their eyes, have the ring of Mapplethorpe about them. He depicts not the act of violence but, perhaps more disturbingly, the result of the violence, as in the 1971 watercolour Embarrassing, which shows a child in her Sunday best, with a serious harelip and a squint, sitting on the floor against a white wall. Her emaciated right arm dangles, her bandaged left hand is placed on a comic book. </p> <p> According to Alexander Borowsky, curator of contemporary art at the state Russian Museum, St Petersburg, comic books gave the teenage Helnwein his \"Damascus experience\". His allegiance to Walt Disney and youthful experience of arch-conservative catholicism prompt him to describe Donald Duck and Jesus as the most important influences in his art. \"When I opened my first comic,\" Helnwein says, \"I felt like someone who has been buried in a mining accident and emerges into the daylight again after days in the dark. I was back home in a reasonable world where one could be flattened by road rollers or riddled with a hundred bullets without being harmed - a world where people looked decent once more.\" </p> <p> Helnwein sought to find this decency in the real world for years, and failed. He moved from Austria (\"If I stayed I would have become a terrorist\") to more liberal Cologne in Germany. Then in 1997 the Lutheran church spearheaded a smear campaign denouncing him as a member of the Scientology sect. He has been open to various philosophies and teachings, he says, but the Scientology claim is one that he passionately denies, adding: \"It's as if the German psyche thrives on witchhunts\". </p> <p>He took his complaint to Germany's constitutional court, which last November ruled that Helnwein and Scientology could no longer be mentioned in the same breath. (\"Please write mainly about the art and not about the Scientology,\" he pleaded at the end of our interview.) Partially as a result of the hate campaign against him, three years ago, Helnwein upped and left Germany with wife, Renate and their four children. They found a new home in a castle just outside Clonmel near Cork, and, says Helnwein, \"we feel at home there like we have nowhere else before and there are good vibrations.\" Asked how much of the attraction is to do with his tax-free status there as an artist, he says: </p> <p> \"Because the authorities have such a respectful attitude towards artists there's a spirit there to create that you find nowhere else in the world. Even the fishermen understand where you're coming from.\" Moving house is as important to the restless Austrian as changing styles. He detests the Roy Liechtenstein format of one idea, one picture. The work of the self-styled \"whirling dervish of the art world\" spans an incredible range of media from sculpture to photography to etching. \"I try to escape the seduction of a certain medium,\" he explains. \"I love to start something new with all the risks and the uncertainty.\" It is the equivalent, he says of colonic irrigation - the only way to avoid artistic blockage and complacency.</p>",

His allegiance to Walt Disney and youthful experience of arch-conservative catholicism prompt him to describe Donald Duck and Jesus as the most important influences in his art. \"When I opened my first comic,\" Helnwein says, \"I felt like someone who has been buried in a mining accident and emerges into the daylight again after days in the dark. I was back home in a reasonable world where one could be flattened by road rollers or riddled with a hundred bullets without being harmed - a world where people looked decent once more.\" Helnwein sought to find this decency in the real world for years, and failed. He moved from Austria (\"If I stayed I would have become a terrorist\") to more liberal Cologne in Germany. Then in 1997 the Lutheran church spearheaded a smear campaign denouncing him as a member of the Scientology sect. He has been open to various philosophies and teachings, he says, but the Scientology claim is one that he passionately denies, adding: \"It's as if the German psyche thrives on witchhunts\". He took his complaint to Germany's constitutional court, which last November ruled that Helnwein and Scientology could no longer be mentioned in the same breath. (\"Please write mainly about the art and not about the Scientology,\" he pleaded at the end of our interview.) Partially as a result of the hate campaign against him, three years ago, Helnwein upped and left Germany with wife, Renate and their four children. They found a new home in a castle just outside Clonmel near Cork, and, says Helnwein, \"we feel at home there like we have nowhere else before and there are good vibrations.\" Asked how much of the attraction is to do with his tax-free status there as an artist, he says: \"Because the authorities have such a respectful attitude towards artists there's a spirit there to create that you find nowhere else in the world. Even the fishermen understand where you're coming from.\" Moving house is as important to the restless Austrian as changing styles. He detests the Roy Liechtenstein format of one idea, one picture. The work of the self-styled \"whirling dervish of the art world\" spans an incredible range of media from sculpture to photography to etching. \"I try to escape the seduction of a certain medium,\" he explains. \"I love to start something new with all the risks and the uncertainty.\" It is the equivalent, he says of colonic irrigation - the only way to avoid artistic blockage and complacency.",

There's no more important job in political journalism, and it has gone to a man with form as a commentator as well as a reporter, who comes from the centre-left and not the right.

Perhaps it's a pity no candidate could be found who was trained for a lifetime in BBC habits.

One can be certain Mr Marr will observe the rules to a fault. </p> <p> Second, the cry goes up, why didn't a rightist get the job? Could he ever have done so? Why not Boris Johnson, instead of Andrew Marr? The question is asked, by the rightist Telegraph, with knowing incredulity. They're sure it could never have happened. Their conspiratorial view of the world tells them the BBC would never let it, because the BBC, as we all know, was Blairite before Blair, a den of progressives from way back. I think this is a false analysis, but one which points some of the way towards the answer to their own question. </p> <p>Given that the BBC's only interest was the test of professional competence, the question should rather be: why would no prominent rightwing commentator be a credible political reporter?

Analysts believe the talks relate to an all-share merger which would effectively translate into a takeover by Terra - which, with a market capitalisation of around \u20ac18bn, is significantly larger than Lycos. \"We think they've got the agreement in the bag apart from a few details, and that it will be a merger,\" said Ramon Ortega, an analyst at Madrid broker Safei. A takeover of Lycos would give Terra improved access to more than 30m Hispanics in the US, and analysts confirmed that the Spanish com pany has been prepared to make aggressive bids in the past. However one Madrid analyst warned: \"It looks like a good match but some people might not like the idea of moving into the United States, which is the most competitive market there is.\" The Spanish company, which is valued at around \u20ac18bn, is also looking to expand southwards into Central and South America. Terra Networks attracted a great deal of publicity last November, when it saw its initial public offering almost triple in value on its first day of trading and ended that day as Europe's largest publicly traded internet company. But the recent turmoil in internet stocks has hit Terra shares, knocking nearly two-thirds off its value since the beginning of the year. News of the probable link-up hurt Freeserve shares in early trading. Dealers, fearing the UK company's prospects in the European market would be hit by the merged entity, marked the shares down as low as 427.5p before a rally saw them close up 16.5p at 469.5p. The net sector has already seen consolidation with deals from firms such as Yahoo!, which a year ago bought online community operator GeoCities and net video provider Broadcast.com. Profits remain elusive, however. The primary example of delivery and content fusion was last year's $6.7bn merger of portal Excite with the high-speed access provider At Home, which has done little so far to pull the two companies out of the red.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There are so many stories about Mikhail Pletnev that I half expect to meet a colossus, an arrogant New Russian who will stop at nothing to achieve his artistic ends. It is something of a surprise to encounter a tired little fellow in a crumpled tweed jacket who greets me, rather disconcertingly, in perfect German. His manager prompts him gently: \"Misha, I think it's in English...\" </p> <p>Pletnev is a living legend of the piano; in person, however, he seems not larger than life, but smaller. He is short, slight, inscrutable, and so softly spoken that I have to strain to hear his words in the hotel bar in Helsinki, where I have caught up with him a few days before he comes to the UK. He looks more like an English schoolmaster than a Russian superstar; his self-deprecation too seems echt-English. \"All I do is play the piano, and enjoy life,\" he says. Then a tell-tale vestige of Russian gloom invades: \"I hope I survive some more time to continue enjoying it.\" </p> <p>Gradually, as he relaxes, a laconic charm begins to emerge, subtle and ironic. Yet between questions he seems beset by a nervous tic, lips working backwards and forwards. It is impossible to tell what he is thinking. </p> <p>At the piano, Pletnev is a powerful force. Tempos and volume can reach every extreme known to the instrument, and his interpretations often polarise listeners. Critics eulogise him wildly, but a Chopin recital I attended seemed to have very little to do with Chopin and a great deal to do with Pletnev himself. At his best - his own transcription of Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty ballet music, or his Hommage to Rachmaninov, on the composer's own piano - Pletnev can be stunning: glittering, passionate and gut-wrenchingly compelling. At other times, the music feels icy, distorted and self-willed, the tone so violent that you almost expect the piano to fall apart. To some musicians, every mark on the composer's page is sacrosanct. For Pletnev, \"It is a starting point... </p> <p>\"You've touched a delicate question,\" he acknowledges, \"but it is quite complicated. Often musicians have played differently from the composer's indications, even Liszt himself. At other times, people have said that we should only play what is written down - but then this is not enough by itself.\" He laughs. \"So everything is wrong!\" </p> <p>How does he account for the extreme reactions he seems to inspire? Pletnev shrugs. \"Sometimes I play well,\" he says, \"and sometimes I do not. I always try to do my best.\" </p> <p>Pletnev is the only child of two musicians: his mother was a r\u00e9p\u00e9titeuse and his father played and taught the bayan (a Russian accordion). He underwent the classic Soviet hothouse musical training - the Central Music School in Moscow from the age of 13 followed by the Moscow Conservatory - and he still lives partly in Russia. \"I live in the field, beside the river,\" he declares poetically. His mother used to travel everywhere with him, and a rarified, protected aura around him is maintained by his manager and friends, who tend to mother him too. </p> <p>Maybe he needs protecting - he seems to enjoy certain types of danger. If a musician's inner life shows in his playing, then Pletnev's mind must have some very unorthodox corners indeed. More definably, he has a passion for fast cars. \"There aren't many roads left in Russia where you can drive like this,\" he says regretfully. \"You cannot go faster than 120km. They fine you!\" </p> <p>Speed notwithstanding, he is not tempted to leave Russia permanently and is relatively optimistic about the country's future. On the day of our interview, Vladimir Putin was inaugurated as Russia's first elected president, something Pletnev regards as a very positive step. \"The first election has been accomplished without any bloodshed, without any shootings. And it is good for Russia to have a leader now who can be strong but not extreme and who can think clearly and coldly about what is going on. Russia needs some organisation.\" </p> <p>What are his feelings about the war in Chechnya? \"I think if there are people there who are trying to solve problems with their guns, or taking children hostage, they must be stopped - but eventually there should be some political solution. Perhaps the way to achieve this is with education, gradually.\" He believes that western claims of human rights violations by the Russians may be exaggerated. \"There has been a similar situation in Northern Ireland for years,\" he announces, continuing whimsically: \"Imagine that in the US, the state of New England declares that it is against the president and wants to destroy all Americans who are not from New England. I am not sure that the US would give it independence so quickly.\" </p> <p>Pletnev is like a musical, slightly out-to-lunch version of Putin - he has that determination, that cleverness and something of that steely gaze. He launched his career in 1974, aged 21, by winning the Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow, one of the world's most important musical prizes. By all accounts, he set about winning quite deliberately and with absolute conviction. \"I decided I wanted to win the Tchaikovsky competition because I knew it would open many doors for my career,\" he says. True, but not the language of the surprised-and-delighted winner more common on the concert scene. </p> <p>In 1991, with equal determination, Pletnev founded the Russian National Orchestra - the first Russian arts organisation independent of the state since 1917. Mikhail Gorbachev encouraged Pletnev in his plans; much has been made of this, but Pletnev explains that \"I founded this orchestra in November 1991, and by then Gorbachev's position was doubtful. There had already been this putsch, and Yeltsin took power two or three months later. I told Gorbachev about this idea and he was very supportive. I respect him very much: he enjoys classical music, especially Tchaikovsky, which is not a common thing among Russian politicians. But the orchestra had more enemies than friends. And the enemies were the powerful ones.\" </p> <p>The creation of the orchestra rubbed people up the wrong way throughout the Russian musical system. Several other conductors were incandescent with fury as their best players decamped for the RNO's higher salaries. Nearly a decade later, however, the RNO is a well established international presence and Pletnev is leaving his position as music director and principal conductor. Isn't it a wrench to leave an organisation to which he has devoted so much time and effort? No, he says. He will still work with the RNO as its conductor laureate, but he is glad to be free of certain administrative responsibilities that he felt were falling too heavily on his shoulders. </p> <p>Steely and determined he may be, but Pletnev can seem impossibly laid-back about his music-making. Conducting? \"It's a nice thing to do. You do not have to practise. But it is difficult because the orchestra never plays the way you want it.\" Or try this: apparently he once recorded three and a half CDs of piano music in one week flat, sleeping in until nearly noon each day and usually giving up well before 4pm. Few musicians would dare to work this way. But he has that kind of brain: highly absorbent, super-charged, mercurial. He composes too: he has written \"a big, romantic viola concerto\" for Yuri Bashmet and reworked the Beethoven Violin Concerto for his friend Michael Collins to play on the clarinet. And he speaks at least five languages fluently, including Japanese. </p> <p>Pletnev's forthcoming Tchaikovsky concerts are sure to be crowd-pullers - everyone loves Tchaikovsky. Is he an easy composer to identify with? Pletnev doesn't think so. \"He was a very complicated person. There are very few musicians who play Tchaikovsky properly - there are many one-sided performances. Most of the time Tchaikovsky is taken as an emotionally exaggerated composer. But his music ranges from the big, powerful things to some which are small and very delicate. As well as the Russian character of his music, there are influences from German and French music; as well as emotion there is intellect and philosophy.\" </p> <p>There is pride in his tone, even possessiveness. Maybe the restrained demeanour is misleading, for there is no false modesty about Pletnev. </p> <p>At some point after his manager returns, Pletnev disappears so quietly that I do not notice him go. When he returns, he drifts over like a shadow wreathed in smoke. But just wait until he gets to the piano. </p> <p>\u0095 Mikhail Pletnev and the Philharmonia Orchestra performTchaikovsky's three piano concertos at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242), tonight and Saturday.</p>",

He composes too: he has written \"a big, romantic viola concerto\" for Yuri Bashmet and reworked the Beethoven Violin Concerto for his friend Michael Collins to play on the clarinet. And he speaks at least five languages fluently, including Japanese. Pletnev's forthcoming Tchaikovsky concerts are sure to be crowd-pullers - everyone loves Tchaikovsky. Is he an easy composer to identify with? Pletnev doesn't think so. \"He was a very complicated person. There are very few musicians who play Tchaikovsky properly - there are many one-sided performances. Most of the time Tchaikovsky is taken as an emotionally exaggerated composer. But his music ranges from the big, powerful things to some which are small and very delicate. As well as the Russian character of his music, there are influences from German and French music; as well as emotion there is intellect and philosophy.\" There is pride in his tone, even possessiveness. Maybe the restrained demeanour is misleading, for there is no false modesty about Pletnev. At some point after his manager returns, Pletnev disappears so quietly that I do not notice him go. When he returns, he drifts over like a shadow wreathed in smoke. But just wait until he gets to the piano. \u0095 Mikhail Pletnev and the Philharmonia Orchestra performTchaikovsky's three piano concertos at the Royal Festival Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242), tonight and Saturday.",

      "bodyText": "The head of the Palestinian team negotiating with Israel resigned yesterday after discovering that a second set of talks had begun secretly in Sweden. The Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, is said to have approved the second channel without consulting his chief negotiator, Yasser Abed Rabbo. Mr Abed Rabbo accused Israel of trying to manipulate the Palestinians by creating an alternative to the official talks. He said he was resigning \"to prevent the existence of more than one negotiating channel and to pave the way for the negotiating team in Stock holm to do this mission alone\". According to Palestinian sources, the Swedish talks were set up by Mr Arafat and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, at their summit meeting last week. The discussions in Stockholm during the past few days are led by Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian parliament, on one side, and Shlomo Ben-Ami, the Israeli minister of public security, on the other. In 1993 Mr Qureia was involved in the secret talks with Israeli officials in Oslo which helped to get the peace process under way. But Mr Abed Rabbo argued yesterday that the situation this time was different. He said the 1993 talks had to be conducted secretly because Israeli law at the time forbade contact with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which Israel considered a terrorist organisation. He called the latest secret talks \"an Israeli game\" aimed at fragmenting the Palestinian position. It was not clear yesterday whether Mr Arafat would accept Mr Abed Rabbo's resignation. He has refused some resignations in the past, allowing discontented officials to continue working with a clear conscience. But yesterday Mr Abed Rabbo insisted that his resignation was final, whether Mr Arafat accepted it or not. The establishment of an alternative negotiating channel almost certainly reflects Israeli dissatisfaction with the progress through the official channel. Equally, Mr Abed Rabbo's resignation, along with the trouble on the streets during the past few days, reflects growing Palestinian hostility to the direction the negotiations have been taking. The draft maps of a future Palestinian state are dotted and crossed with Israeli settlements and roads and there is no sign yet of a plan for Jerusalem or for the refugee problem which could win public acceptance on both sides. With no Israeli-Syrian deal to pressure Mr Arafat's negotiators, the Palestinian track appears to be heading for a stalemate or a stitch-up under intense pressure from the US.",

I'm always vague, but at the moment I'm dangerous. If I were taking care of a young child, I'd have damaged it by now. If I were doing anything that required motor control, such as using a sewing machine or a nuclear safety system, my hand would have slipped. The Horses of the Apocalypse, I expect, will be absent-mindedly unleashed by someone with pregnancy-induced insomnia.

In teaching, no one else would want it. But imagine if I had a corporate or city job, one with a suit, glass elevator, glass ceiling. I would have lost contracts, contacts, my rag, my secretary. My colleagues would be tutting at me, pitying me, resenting me, and they would have reason because I'd be leaning on them. I would be noted down as someone not coping with pregnancy.

If there's anyone left in the country who hasn't heard that there's a crisis in the car industry, chances are they are equally oblivious to the fact that Ken Livingstone is mayor of London. Yet there's another crisis going on in manufacturing which has escaped most people's attention. This industry is the eighth largest manufacturer in the UK. It employs around 300,000 workers: more than farming, more than the car industry, more than chemicals. Job losses ran to over 41,000 last year, another 25,000 are expected this year, and most of those made redundant are Labour-voting breadwinners in areas of high unemployment. But we're not talking cars or coal or farming or steel. We're talking textiles. And we're talking women.</p> <p>Maggie Rowley worked as a machinist for Coates Viyella, a major supplier to Marks &amp; Spencer, for 20 years. She was one of 450 women made redundant 18 months ago, when M&amp;S moved to Morocco its manufacturing base for the trousers on which she worked. Her factory was one of two in Rossington, an old mining village outside Doncaster. On the one road into the village is the pit where her brothers, all miners, were once employed; one still is, the rest work on chicken farms.</p> <p>Rowley's is a fairly typical story. She was lucky enough to get another textiles job after the factory closed. It meant two bus journeys to work and the minimum wage in a non-union factory, but her husband was on long-term sick and she was the wage-earner, so she didn't have a choice.</p> <p>She was made redundant from that job, too. Now she works in a lighting components factory, still two bus journeys away, still non-union. She can't see any chance of working in textiles again and neither can most of the women with whom she worked. \"In my factory, we had grandmothers, mothers and daughters all working together,\" she says. \"We were very close-knit, very involved in the miners' strike, 100% union membership. I was proud of my time there; we had a strong workforce and produced quality garments. But there was no investment, no training, no planning. Now we're losing a whole industry and it's devastating.\"</p> <p>As for the car workers: \"Don't get me wrong, I feel for them, I really do. I just wish we could get the same publicity. The thing is, they're focused in one area, whereas we're scattered. And we're women.\"</p> <p>Many workers believe their plight has considerably more to do with gender than geography. Among them is Maxine Nixon, North West representative for the GMB clothing and textile section. Born and bred in the mill town of Oldham, and a textile worker since she left school at 15, she sees Labour's neglect of the issue as unforgivable. \"It doesn't matter that the job losses are scattered - 40,000 is 40,000, wherever they are. I genuinely believe this isn't being taken as seriously as Longbridge because it's a women's industry. If we were men, something would have been done about it years ago.\"</p> <p>The unions agree. The GMB has already accused the government of sexism over its failure to offer the same kind of rescue package to the textile industry as it has to cars, coal and farming. Textiles union KFAT, while fighting shy of using the S word, is equally furious. But while trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers has hastily put together a strategy group, there is no promise of immediate government intervention to help with widespread redundancies.</p> <p>It might make less spectacular headlines than Longbridge or Dagenham, but the fact that textile workers are scattered does not lessen the impact of redundancy. While a quarter of the industry is based in the east Midlands, there are significant centres in Yorkshire, Lancashire, Scotland and south Wales. Most of these are traditional mining heartlands, where textile plants have replaced pits as the main employers. Around the same time as the closure of the Coates Viyella factory at which Rowley worked, the plants in Wretford, 10 miles away, and Missterton were also shut. Not counting closures in Doncaster itself, 1,000 textile jobs have gone in the area.</p> <p>In south Wales, where Bairdwear Textiles, another M&amp;S supplier, has shut down all its plants, 4,500 jobs have been lost. Ann Leader, who worked at the Baird factory in Maesteg until Christmas, says she is fortunate that her children have been able to help out. \"People automatically assume men are the breadwinners,\" she says. \"But that's not the case. It hasn't been for years. We're not talking about pin money. It's women who are keeping their families.\"</p> <p>One of the major problems for women in these areas is accessibility. In south Wales, as in other mining communities, textile factories were set up precisely where there was a small, local workforce desperate for a full-time wage. Women could get to work without travelling and many of them didn't have transport. Now they are stuck. What jobs there are available are part-time, poorly paid and unskilled. Some women have moved into shop or care work, some into components factories, a few back into education. There are new call centres in Cardiff and Swansea, but getting there is a problem.</p> <p>It's the same story in Scotland. Ruby Murray has just lost her job at the Baird plant in Grangemouth, Stirlingshire. Her daughter, sister and best friend worked there, too. \"We're looking at devastation,\" she says. \"I'm disgusted at the way Blair has handled Rover. When our plant closed, not even our local MP turned up. We're talking about single parents, we're talking about women who were sole breadwinners. Most of those women are now unemployed. If you can't drive, there are no jobs. We'll never get the industry saved in Britain without government intervention. And there has been no intervention because we're women.\"</p> <p>KFAT has warned: \"If the government pays just lip service to the forthcoming report, we will be very angry indeed.\" Most of the women who have lost their jobs, their skills and their chance of a decent wage are already angry. It's just that no one's listening.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ford hopes to push back its share of the European car market to above 10% within three years. This follows the restructuring of its operations - which included the shutdown of its car assembly plant at Dagenham in east London. Ford commands about 8.6% of the market, a much reduced figure from the near 12% share it used to enjoy in the 1980s. The US car company wants to increase the number of new models designed to appeal to European consumers, according to a report pub lished in the Wall Street Journal yesterday. The company believes that it can speed up the time it takes to bring a car to market - from the moment it is designed to the point where it reaches the showroom. The newspaper noted that Ford also wishes to reposition itself as a manufacturer of \"elite\" models in Europe, even in the light of its announcement on Friday of production cuts. First in the line of launches is the new Mondeo, which is due out this autumn. The Mondeo has lost out to VW's Passat in many countries, but the company hopes to reverse that trend by employing design and marketing tactics which have won plaudits for the Focus, which is Ford's most highly rated car.",

They expect Mr Mandelson to outline his preference for the union flag tonight, and it appeared yesterday that Sinn Fein would reluctantly acquiesce.</p> <p>But there will be no debate on the policing bill until next week.</p> <p>One senior Ulster Unionist said: \"It's smoke and mirrors. The name will change to the Police Service of Northern Ireland next year, as the government always planned. It's only the announcement that is being delayed.\"</p> <p>Mr Mandelson also announced he was setting up the Royal Ulster Constabulary George Cross Foundation, which he said would mark the sacrifices and honour the achievements of the 78-year-old force. Ulster Unionists welcomed it, but pointed out it had been under discussion for some time and said it would not change many minds.</p> <p>The British and Irish government attempts to prompt a return to devolution next Monday were also hit after Mr Trimble met with IRA weapons inspectors Cyril Ramaphosa, the former secretary general of the African National Congress, and Martti Ahtisaari, the ex-Finnish president. They met with Tony Blair, Mr Mandelson and Brian Cowen, the Irish foreign affairs minister, and the political parties in Belfast.</p> <p>Mr Trimble suggested that putting arms beyond use, as the IRA had promised to do, could only be an initial step towards formal decommissioning, not a permanent solution.</p> <p>John Taylor, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionists, said yesterday: \"I feel downhearted compared to a week ago. I always had reservations, but they have increased in the past eight days rather than decreased. The government is dragging its feet.\"</p> <p>David Burnside, the PR guru who forwarded the motion to tie a return to government to retention of the RUC's name, said it was too early to judge whether Mr Trimble would even forward a motion seeking to go back into the executive. There would be no point, as matters stood.</p> <p>Mr Burnside, who confirmed that he was considering standing for the vacant south Antrim seat, is, like Mr Taylor, regarded as critical. Their doubts underscored last night's sense of crisis.</p> <p>Sources from the two governments are deeply disappointed at Mr Trimble's failure to seize the initiative and sell the IRA's unprecedented offer on arms to his party. They fear he will have lost too much ground if he leaves it until late in the week.</p>",

MPs will tonight debate an order giving Mr Mandelson the power to intervene where local parties fail to agree on which flags should fly over government buildings on designated days. Ulster Unionists are happier with that solution. They expect Mr Mandelson to outline his preference for the union flag tonight, and it appeared yesterday that Sinn Fein would reluctantly acquiesce. But there will be no debate on the policing bill until next week. One senior Ulster Unionist said: \"It's smoke and mirrors. The name will change to the Police Service of Northern Ireland next year, as the government always planned. It's only the announcement that is being delayed.\" Mr Mandelson also announced he was setting up the Royal Ulster Constabulary George Cross Foundation, which he said would mark the sacrifices and honour the achievements of the 78-year-old force. Ulster Unionists welcomed it, but pointed out it had been under discussion for some time and said it would not change many minds. The British and Irish government attempts to prompt a return to devolution next Monday were also hit after Mr Trimble met with IRA weapons inspectors Cyril Ramaphosa, the former secretary general of the African National Congress, and Martti Ahtisaari, the ex-Finnish president. They met with Tony Blair, Mr Mandelson and Brian Cowen, the Irish foreign affairs minister, and the political parties in Belfast. Mr Trimble suggested that putting arms beyond use, as the IRA had promised to do, could only be an initial step towards formal decommissioning, not a permanent solution. John Taylor, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionists, said yesterday: \"I feel downhearted compared to a week ago. I always had reservations, but they have increased in the past eight days rather than decreased. The government is dragging its feet.\" David Burnside, the PR guru who forwarded the motion to tie a return to government to retention of the RUC's name, said it was too early to judge whether Mr Trimble would even forward a motion seeking to go back into the executive. There would be no point, as matters stood. Mr Burnside, who confirmed that he was considering standing for the vacant south Antrim seat, is, like Mr Taylor, regarded as critical. Their doubts underscored last night's sense of crisis. Sources from the two governments are deeply disappointed at Mr Trimble's failure to seize the initiative and sell the IRA's unprecedented offer on arms to his party. They fear he will have lost too much ground if he leaves it until late in the week.",

      "body": "<p>Renault and Nissan claimed yesterday that combining their operations will allow them to become Europe's best selling motor group within five years - leap-frogging Volkswagen and Ford. </p> <p>The alliance, formed when Renault bought 37% of Nissan for $5.4bn last year, will restructure its European dealer networks and introduce limited cross-badging of vehicles to speed the struggling Japanese carmaker's return to profit. It aims to increase its share of the European market for cars and light commercials from 14.2% to 17% by 2005. </p> <p>More than 800 Nissan employees will lose their jobs, though this will be offset by the creation of nearly 400 Renault jobs. Further job cuts are expected at Nissan and Renault dealers. </p> <p>Francois Hilfray, Renault's executive vice president for sales and marketing, said the alliance's policy was to develop shared platforms and power trains, but this required time. </p> <p>In the interim, there would be some cross-badging, with some Nissan off-road vehicles appearing under the Renault name, and some Renault light commercials with the Nissan badge. They would be adapted to give an appropriate brand identity. </p> <p>Renault is particularly interested in the Nissan Terrano, made in Spain, and the Patrol, made in Japan. Both would have to be restyled to give them a Renault \"look\". Nissan wants to exploit Renault's successful Trafic, Master and Kangoo vans. The first shared platform will be for the new Nissan Micra and Renault Clio, expected in 2003. </p> <p>Nissan confirmed that the company might decide to move Micra production from its Sunderland plant to a cheaper location on the continent. A final decision would be taken at the end of the year. A senior official blamed the strong pound for increasing costs at Sunderland, even though it is the most efficient car plant in Europe. </p> <p>Loss of Micra production could cost several thousand jobs at the Sunderland plant and at associated suppliers. </p> <p>The European dealer networks of Nissan and Renault are to be restructured to create new superdealers who will handle back office work - such as parts and accessories, accounting and legal services - for dealers of both marques in a given area. </p> <p>Last year Renault sold 180,000 cars and vans in the UK, while Nissan sold just under 100,000. Combined Renault and Nissan sales in Europe last year totalled 2.4m vehicles. Renault has 11.3% of the market against Nissan's 2.9%. </p> <p>Renault said that many small dealers would probably be taken over by the larger companies or join with others to create their own joint back office operation. </p> <p>This would leave small dealers as little more than showroom and servicing operations possibly with an interest in a back office business.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Renault and Nissan claimed yesterday that combining their operations will allow them to become Europe's best selling motor group within five years - leap-frogging Volkswagen and Ford. The alliance, formed when Renault bought 37% of Nissan for $5.4bn last year, will restructure its European dealer networks and introduce limited cross-badging of vehicles to speed the struggling Japanese carmaker's return to profit. It aims to increase its share of the European market for cars and light commercials from 14.2% to 17% by 2005. More than 800 Nissan employees will lose their jobs, though this will be offset by the creation of nearly 400 Renault jobs. Further job cuts are expected at Nissan and Renault dealers. Francois Hilfray, Renault's executive vice president for sales and marketing, said the alliance's policy was to develop shared platforms and power trains, but this required time. In the interim, there would be some cross-badging, with some Nissan off-road vehicles appearing under the Renault name, and some Renault light commercials with the Nissan badge. They would be adapted to give an appropriate brand identity. Renault is particularly interested in the Nissan Terrano, made in Spain, and the Patrol, made in Japan. Both would have to be restyled to give them a Renault \"look\". Nissan wants to exploit Renault's successful Trafic, Master and Kangoo vans. The first shared platform will be for the new Nissan Micra and Renault Clio, expected in 2003. Nissan confirmed that the company might decide to move Micra production from its Sunderland plant to a cheaper location on the continent. A final decision would be taken at the end of the year. A senior official blamed the strong pound for increasing costs at Sunderland, even though it is the most efficient car plant in Europe. Loss of Micra production could cost several thousand jobs at the Sunderland plant and at associated suppliers. The European dealer networks of Nissan and Renault are to be restructured to create new superdealers who will handle back office work - such as parts and accessories, accounting and legal services - for dealers of both marques in a given area. Last year Renault sold 180,000 cars and vans in the UK, while Nissan sold just under 100,000. Combined Renault and Nissan sales in Europe last year totalled 2.4m vehicles. Renault has 11.3% of the market against Nissan's 2.9%. Renault said that many small dealers would probably be taken over by the larger companies or join with others to create their own joint back office operation. This would leave small dealers as little more than showroom and servicing operations possibly with an interest in a back office business.",

The prospect of Tyson, a convicted rapist, being allowed back into Britain so soon after his February bout with the British heavyweight, Julius Francis, in Manchester, sparked immediate protests in the Scottish parliament and among women's groups. Scotland's national football stadium, Hampden Park, and Celtic's Parkhead stadium are believed to be competing to stage the fight, which would be with Lou Savarese. But a Labour member of the Scottish parliament, Hugh Henry, said last night that he had tabled a motion criticising the move with the backing of other Labour figures: \"I understand that the immigration laws in this country ban foreign nationals who have criminal convictions of more than a year from entering the country.

At the time, the home secretary hinted that the permit was a one-off and that Tyson would be refused a work permit if he tried to fight in Britain again. This time Mr Straw will be considering the boxer's visa application in less charged circumstances than in January when the 21,000 tickets for the fight had already been sold and when the commercial disaster that cancellation would have triggered contributed to the \"exceptional circumstances\" of his decision.

Radioactive alarms went off at the vesta Foundry, in Sheffield, after the plutonium was already in the works, making it impossible for the contamination to be stopped. This is the first time plutonium, the most toxic substance in the world, has been discovered in scrap metal. It has caused alarm at the Department of the Environment. This is the third time this year that nuclear material has turned up in unauthorised places, and the discovery is leading to increasing fears about the possibility of widespread contamination, although so far none has occurred. In March a scrap firm, Mormet (Alloys) of Tamworth, Staffordshire, reported finding a uranium fuel rod in its warehouse during routine checks, and the same month Nicholas Remblance, a rubbish tip manager from Ipswich, found that he had been carrying around 20lb of uranium in his van for six months. The origin of the plutonium is unknown and the health and safety executive and the environment agency are trying to find out if a criminal offence has been committed. The incident happened on March 31, but the fact that plutonium was involved was not known at the time and was kept secret subsequently. About 16 tonnes of metal and slag are so badly contaminated that they will have to be stored for many years until Britain finds somewhere to dispose of the material. Plutonium 238 is used in medical equipment as well as the nuclear industry, so the source could be hard to track down. According to Environmental Data Services, the journal which revealed the plutonium contamination, there is increasing alarm about the dangers of recycled nuclear material.",

Charter was eventually taken out with an agreed offer by Lincoln Electric Holdings of the US which valued the business at double its stock market rating. Glynwed is thought by many to deserve similar value. Chairman Ewen Macpherson told the company's annual general meeting last month that the company's prospects were better than ever. Trading profits rose last year from \u00a353.6m to \u00a386.7m and management is promising operating margins up to 12% and a return on capital of 15% this year. Glynwed has been promising to sell fine wines, recipes, and exotic holidays over the internet to its affluent individual customers. The company could yet find corporate buyers clicking on to its charms as well.",

There is no step back after that,\" Zoran Djindjic, leader of the Democratic Party, said at the rally in Republic Square, attended by around 30,000 people. The demand came as the Milosevic regime acted against students and activists from the youth movement Otpor (Resistance) after the weekend assassination of a senior government figure in the northern city of Novi Sad. Opposition leaders called the demonstration after cancelling a rally in Pozarevac, Mr Milosevic's home town, last Tuesday, accusing the author ities of blocking access to roads and detaining activists and independent journalists. It had been planned as a protest against the alleged beatings of three supporters of the Otpor movement in the town. Student organisers admitted that they were disappointed with the turnout at yesterday's rally, which drew only a fraction of the 100,000 people who attended a rally in Belgrade on April 14. Tension increased at the weekend after an unknown assassin shot Bosko Perosevic, a senior official in Mr Milosevic's Socialist party and head of the Vojvodina provincial government. Official spokesmen blamed the murder on the youth movement, opposition parties and foreign governments. At yesterday's rally, Branko Ilic, a 20-year-old member of Otpor, called for a minute's silence from the crowd as a mark of respect. \"For us Brako Perosevic is a victim,\" he said. The police detained several activists at the weekend, but released them after questioning. They also issued wanted posters for the arrest of two Otpor members, saying they were sought in connection with Perosevic's murder. The resistance movement dismissed the allegations. It said the two wanted youths were in Bosnia at the time of the murder and had been there for a month. The Yugoslav information minister, Goran Matic, warned that the authorities would take action against Otpor. It was not a registered organisation and would no longer be tolerated, he said. Members who continued with street actions would be arrested, he said, adding: \"The time of street spectacles is over.\" The assassination of Perosevic was caught on television. He received a call on his mo bile phone while he was attending an agricultural fair. He moved away from his official delegation to take the call and was shot at close blank range by a security guard. The police gave chase and arrested the man. Mr Matic said that the man held for the murder, Milivoje Gutovic, 50, was linked to the opposition. He said police found Otpor propaganda in his flat, and manuals on terrorism. \"It has been firmly established that Gutovic is a member of Otpor, and according to his own statement, a member of the Serbian Renewal Movement with close ties to some of the party members and sympathisers,\" he said. But the Democratic party said its local representative in the Novi Sad area knew Mr Gutovic. It denied that he was an opposition supporter, saying that he was a supporter of Mr Milosevic's Socialist party.",

Even 54% of Conservative voters are satisfied with her performance.</p> <p>An enormous 58% of all voters say Mo Mowlam, the Cabinet Office minister, is doing a good job and only 18% believe she is not up to it. This performance shows that she remains Labour's strongest electoral card and is likely to lay to rest the Westminster whispering campaign against her and any lingering questions over her future in the cabinet.</p> <p>In fact, the ICM survey shows that the three senior Labour women in the cabinet all do better than their male counterparts even if in the cases of Margaret Beckett, the leader of the House of Commons at +18, and Clare Short, the international development secretary at +12, their low profile means that more than one in three voters does not have an opinion on whether or not they are doing a good or bad job.</p> <p>The third annual Guardian/ICM cabinet rankings survey appears to show that the voters are beginning to discriminate quite sharply between the way they view the leading players in the government.</p> <p>While the popularity of the \"big-hitters\" such as the chancellor, Gordon Brown, Jack Straw, the home secretary and Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, are quite closely grouped around that of Tony Blair at around +3 to -7, John Prescott, the deputy prime minster, is by the far most unpopular of the leading lights, with a negative popularity rating of -22 points.</p> <p>Even among Labour voters only 46% think he is doing a good job compared with 38% who are dissatisfied with his performance.</p> <p>It almost as though Mr Prescott is acting as a lightning rod for the government and attracts all the hostility of voters who believe it has yet to deliver.</p> <p>However, the poll also shows that Peter Mandelson's return to the cabinet has been surprisingly well received by voters. His performance as Northern Ireland secretary ranks him as the fourth most popular cabinet member, with a rating of +14. He also has a higher recognition factor than at least one of those above him.</p> <p>This has been an impressive performance by Mr Mandelson since in the two previous years he was among the most unpopular ministers in the public's judgement. It seems that the \"master of spin\" has proved adept at persuading the public to forgive his transgressions and see him as a serious politician. No doubt the recent breakthrough in the Northern Ireland peace process has helped him.</p> <p>Another cabinet minister who has outperformed most of his colleagues is David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, whose +14 rating (down 7) must reflect the fact that Labour is seen to have made some headway in schools.</p> <p>In contrast Alan Milburn, who is in charge of the national health service, is suffering badly with a -12 rating compared with his predecessor Frank Dobson's rating of +15 before he left the cabinet to launch his unsuccessful campaign to become London mayor.</p> <p>Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, who has been battered by crises at Rover and Ford, is not seen as a great success by voters. Only 29% said he is doing a good job, with 34% saying they were not satisfied. This, added to a low visibility factor, gave him a net rating of -5.</p> <p>\u0095ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,003 adults aged over 18 by telephone between May 13 and 15.

This performance shows that she remains Labour's strongest electoral card and is likely to lay to rest the Westminster whispering campaign against her and any lingering questions over her future in the cabinet. In fact, the ICM survey shows that the three senior Labour women in the cabinet all do better than their male counterparts even if in the cases of Margaret Beckett, the leader of the House of Commons at +18, and Clare Short, the international development secretary at +12, their low profile means that more than one in three voters does not have an opinion on whether or not they are doing a good or bad job. The third annual Guardian/ICM cabinet rankings survey appears to show that the voters are beginning to discriminate quite sharply between the way they view the leading players in the government. While the popularity of the \"big-hitters\" such as the chancellor, Gordon Brown, Jack Straw, the home secretary and Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, are quite closely grouped around that of Tony Blair at around +3 to -7, John Prescott, the deputy prime minster, is by the far most unpopular of the leading lights, with a negative popularity rating of -22 points. Even among Labour voters only 46% think he is doing a good job compared with 38% who are dissatisfied with his performance. It almost as though Mr Prescott is acting as a lightning rod for the government and attracts all the hostility of voters who believe it has yet to deliver. However, the poll also shows that Peter Mandelson's return to the cabinet has been surprisingly well received by voters. His performance as Northern Ireland secretary ranks him as the fourth most popular cabinet member, with a rating of +14. He also has a higher recognition factor than at least one of those above him. This has been an impressive performance by Mr Mandelson since in the two previous years he was among the most unpopular ministers in the public's judgement. It seems that the \"master of spin\" has proved adept at persuading the public to forgive his transgressions and see him as a serious politician. No doubt the recent breakthrough in the Northern Ireland peace process has helped him. Another cabinet minister who has outperformed most of his colleagues is David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, whose +14 rating (down 7) must reflect the fact that Labour is seen to have made some headway in schools. In contrast Alan Milburn, who is in charge of the national health service, is suffering badly with a -12 rating compared with his predecessor Frank Dobson's rating of +15 before he left the cabinet to launch his unsuccessful campaign to become London mayor. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, who has been battered by crises at Rover and Ford, is not seen as a great success by voters. Only 29% said he is doing a good job, with 34% saying they were not satisfied. This, added to a low visibility factor, gave him a net rating of -5. \u0095ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,003 adults aged over 18 by telephone between May 13 and 15. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.",

      "bodyText": "An unemployed man with a psychopathic disorder yesterday admitted carrying out an arson attack that killed seven people, including four generations of the same family. Richard Fielding, 21, who has a history of psychiatric problems, pleaded guilty at the Old Bailey to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. He set light to petrol he had poured through the letterbox of a three-storey house in Chingford, east London. Police believe Fielding started the fire because of a grudge he held against Lee Day, 22, a childhood friend who lived at the house. Mr Day perished in the attack in March last year along with his grandmother Kathleen Day, 76, his mother Sandra Day, 51, his girlfriend Yvonne Culverhouse, 17, and his three children - twin girls Maddison and Rhiannon Himpfen-Day, three, and Reece Himpfen, two. The only family member to escape was Lee Day's father Brian Day, 52, who was rescued from an upstairs window by neighbours. Orlando Pownall, prosecuting, said the decision to accept the defendant's plea of manslaughter had been a difficult one. But, he said, in the end the weight of psychiatric evidence that concluded Fielding was mentally ill meant \"there could be no realistic prospect of a conviction for murder\". Mr Pownall told the court that on the night of March 6 last year Fielding left his home in Walthamstow following an argument with his mother, and cycled to a nearby petrol station where he filled a five-litre can with four-star petrol. Fifteen minutes later he arrived at the Day family home where he poured petrol through the letter box and lit the vapours with a match before pedalling off. In the minutes that followed neighbours battled desperately to save the family from the fire. David Garner kicked down the front door, but was unable to get in because of the ferocity of the blaze. Another neighbour, James Barnett, tried to smash the back door down, but the heat of the fire was causing the windows of the house to explode, showering glass on those below. Mr Garner took a ladder to the front of the house where Craig Durrell was able to get Brian Day out. Fielding was arrested nine days later and charged with the murders. Initially he denied the attack, claiming he knew nothing about it, but later confessed in a series of conversations with police officers. \"You'll never get me for murder, I will get off with arson or criminal damage,\" he told one. Police were initially baffled as to the motive for the crime, but Fielding appeared to have held a perceived grudge against Lee Day. The two men had been at secondary school together, and Fielding alleged they had been involved in a robbery in which he injured his hand. Fielding became increasingly paranoid about the injury, claiming it was stopping him working as a DJ and that no woman would want him because of his disfigurement. He is also understood to have alleged Mr Day supplied him with drugs that damaged his nose, ruining any chance he thought he had of becoming a male model. The court was told that Fielding had displayed behaviour since childhood the severity of which amounted to a psychopathic disorder. He began glue sniffing at the age of nine, before progressing on to cannabis, LSD and ecstasy, and at the age of 12 he was excluded from school because of his conduct. Sarla Verma, who had treated Fielding at the high security Rampton hospital in Nottinghamshire, told the court he was an \"extremely dangerous individual\" who had shown no remorse for his crimes. The Recorder of London, Michael Hyam, is due to pass sentence today on Fielding, who denies a charge of attempted murder against Brian Day.",

      "bodyText": "An explosion ripped through a fireworks factory in south-east Spain yesterday, killing five workers and raising fresh fears about the safety of the manufacturing industry. Another two people were reported missing in the blast just outside Rafelcofer near Valencia, which came just three days after a devastating fireball from a fireworks warehouse destroyed parts of the Dutch town of Enschede. The cause of the explosion in Spain was not immediately known. In Holland, shock at Saturday's blast was giving way yesterday to widespread anger that a fireworks depot could legally be located in the heart of a residential area. As forensic teams resumed the search for remains of bodies from the explosion - which killed 20 and injured 600 - media coverage focused on security lapses and possible links with recent arson attacks in the town. Enschede's local paper, Tubantia, reported expectations of full compensation from the city authorities. \"I believe there are some very serious questions to be answered by the town council,\" said lawyer Ernst Foke, whose offices are just streets away from the centre of the blast. \"Under Dutch law, they are going to be held responsible.\" The owners of the warehouse, identified only as R Bakker and W Pater, have contacted the city and said they will be available for an investigation into the cause of the disaster, said Erik Helder, a deputy mayor. Puzzlement and consternation were evident across the Netherlands. \"It is incomprehensible that something like this can happen in a well-ordered country, with so many rules,\" the Amsterdam-based newspaper De Telegraaf said in an editorial. The Dutch prime minister, Wim Kok, announced on Sunday that he was ordering a full investigation into the disaster, the country's worst since an El Al cargo plane crashed into an Amsterdam apartment block in October 1992, killing 43 people. Pope John Paul II sent a telegram to the Dutch Cardinal Adrianus Simonis expressing his \"deep sorrow\" in light of the tragedy and saying his prayers were with the victims. House-to-house searches of the devastated Roombeek neighbourhood resumed at first light, but Dick De Jong, the head of the disaster victim identification team, said he was not optimistic that anyone might still be alive under the rubble, even though only 20% of the blast area had been searched, after rescue efforts were hampered by intense heat. \"If you see what has happened and the state of the area, I'm afraid not [anyone else has survived],\" Mr De Jong said. Police Chief Herman van Ruggen said streets on the periphery of the damaged area had been declared structurally sound and were reopened. Many of the 2,500 residents began returning to their shattered homes. But some people were angry when they arrived only to find that their houses were in the inner restricted area and police turned them away. \"We thought we were go ing to be able to go home,\" said Aryan Curre, 45. It is still not known what caused the explosion, but some reports have mentioned the possibility of arson after a spate of smaller fires in the area in recent days. Tubantia said local officials had known how many boxes of fireworks were stored at the site but were not capable of assessing their explosive power, which was thought to be greater than that of commercially available fireworks. De Telegraaf asked: \"Why didn't everyone know that the building was a fireworks warehouse? Are there more fire work depots in the middle of residential areas? Was there enough supervision?\" It called on the government's investigation to look beyond Saturday's tragedy to other fireworks companies and warehouses, as well as the laws and regulations governing fireworks storage.",

      "bodyText": "Scotland is suffering from an epidemic of illiteracy affecting as many as one in four adults, it was claimed yesterday. Estimates drawn up by the Scottish executive suggest that up to 1m Scottish adults are functionally illiterate; 400,000 of them are unable to work because they lack the basic skills to hold down a job; and 1.2m cannot do the basic sums needed to calcuate how much change they should get. There has never been an attempt to gather statistics on illiteracy in Scotland, but the estimates are consistent with research released last week by the basic skills agency which suggested that 24% of adults in England have poor basic skills. Henry McLeish, the Scottish enterprise and lifelong learning minister, said efforts would be made to gather exact statistics to tackle the issue. \"The problem has got to the stage where it has to be addressed. It is unacceptable in a modern society and we have to take action now to make sure that everyone in Scotland has the same opportunities,\" he said. \"The problem also has a major impact on the economy. We have 120,000 job vacancies and 120,000 people out of work.

In a speech to the Society of Editors Ms France told journalists she was \"no apologist for government policy\" and attacked the bill for concentrating on what could not be published, rather than telling the public about their new rights. She told newspaper editors: \"I think it is very important if we're going to have freedom of information law, that there should be as much clarity as possible and there I am prepared to say that I find it incredible that the drafting of recent legislation of which I had to take an interest, is so complex. \"I actually cannot understand why it is so complex.\" She added that even her own lawyers found the legislation difficult, and they had the job of providing her with expert advice on what to release to the public and the press. Ms France went on: \"There are actually some important new rights within the legislation, but it \u00eds drafted back to front.\" She pointed out that there was nothing in the bill to define its purpose, which would make it very difficult for her to decide how to take decisions on what could be released. She reiterated her concern that the bill should have a \"purpose clause\" defining exactly what her new role should be. The home secretary has refused to include such a clause and made it clear that he does not want officials to have the powers to overrule cabinet ministers on what can be published under the new legislation. Mrs France warned that she would have no truck with civil servants complaining they had to spend too much time drawing up codes of practice to allow the public the right to access government information. She said: \"There are people already lobbying the Home Office to say that the NHS is going to grind to a halt if everybody has to produce publication schemes.That shouldn't be the case.\" Ms France's attack on the bill comes as the government is gearing up for strong opposition in the House of Lords. Peers are expected to press for her to have the power of equivalent information commissioners in the United States, Canada and Ireland to overrule ministers.

The American authors, Jerrold L Schecter and Peter S Deriabin, who have examined both western and Soviet archives of the period, regard Penkovsky as \"the spy who saved the world\". If this is true, the Cowells deserve credit for the part they played as frontline members of the joint SIS/CIA team that ran the superspy.</p> <p>Penkovsky was a dream defector. He was well-placed in the Soviet hierarchy, and was prepared to remain in place gathering what information he could for as long as the KGB did not suspect him.</p> <p>The first husband-and-wife team to run him were Charles \"Rauri\" and Janet Chisholm. Mrs Chisholm would take her three children for a walk in a Moscow park, Penkovsky would wander past, stop to admire the baby and leave his packet of information in the pram. But Mrs Chisholm was recalled to London in June 1962 because she was pregnant. The Cowells replaced her, but the plan for servicing Penkovsky was different.</p> <p>All official British flats in Moscow kept a tin of Harpic in the bathroom. Penkovsky would be invited to a party in one of the flats. Mrs Cowell would go to the bathroom and replace the Harpic tin with one that had a false bottom containing film and instructions. Penkovsky would enter the bathroom, remove the film and insert his material - ready for Mrs Cowell to collect.</p> <p>But Penkovsky had already supplied his most vital piece of information. A year earlier, he had handed over photographs of a Soviet missile manual, which had enabled the Americans to identify launch sites the Soviets were building in Cuba as being for SS-4 missiles. With a range of 1,100 miles, these were quite capable of hitting Washington.</p> <p>Challenged over this disclosure by President Kennedy, the Soviet leader, Nikita Krushchev, refused to back down and remove the weapons without concessions over American missiles in Turkey. In the end, both leaders realised that their intransigence could result in a nuclear war, and they quickly reached an accommodation.</p> <p>After that, the Cowells did not last much longer in the Soviet Union. The KGB, suspicious of Penkovsky for some time, arrested him on October 22 1962, put him on trial and executed him on May 16 the following year. In the subsequent fall-out, the role of the Cowells was revealed and they were speedily expelled from Moscow.</p> <p>Cowell had joined SIS in 1951, having been spotted by secret service recruiters at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he took a first-class degress in Russian and French. He was an ideal recruit; a reserved manner concealed a steely determination and a deep love of his country.</p> <p>Born in Sale, Cheshire, he had studied under Jesuits at St Bede's College, Manchester, before volunteering for the RAF as soon as he turned 18. After the war, he worked for GCHQ, the government agency which intercepts military and commercial communications for intelligence purposes. Cowell's task was listening to Soviet traffic.</p> <p>After training, he was posted abroad under Foreign Office cover, first to the political division of the allied control commission in Germany, and then, in 1958, to the British embassy in Jordan. In between these postings, he worked as a desk officer at SIS headquarters in London.</p> <p>After his expulsion from Moscow, Cowell served in Bonn from 1964-66, in Paris from 1972-76 and in Tel Aviv from 1978-81, when he took early retirement. Four years later, having found no satisfactory outlet for his energy, he returned to SIS to do research work in its archive. In 1988, the Foreign Office made him its adviser on the wartime work of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), helping historians assess its importance.</p> <p>The work gripped him, and on his final retirement in 1996 he became chairman of the historical sub-committee of the Special Forces Club. He also used his considerable artistic talent to design two memorial plaques, one in Westminister Abbey to commemorate the work of SOE, and the other at the site of Ravensbruck concentration camp, in memory of SOE women agents who were executed there.</p> <p>Cowell enjoyed Russian literature and translated several Russian authors, including Ivan Valeriy and Vladimir Tendryakov. He was made an MBE in the last new year's honours list. He leaves his wife, two sons and two daughters.</p> <p>Gervase Cowell, intelligence agent and diplomat, born August 4 1926; died May 2 2000</p>",

A year earlier, he had handed over photographs of a Soviet missile manual, which had enabled the Americans to identify launch sites the Soviets were building in Cuba as being for SS-4 missiles. With a range of 1,100 miles, these were quite capable of hitting Washington. Challenged over this disclosure by President Kennedy, the Soviet leader, Nikita Krushchev, refused to back down and remove the weapons without concessions over American missiles in Turkey. In the end, both leaders realised that their intransigence could result in a nuclear war, and they quickly reached an accommodation. After that, the Cowells did not last much longer in the Soviet Union. The KGB, suspicious of Penkovsky for some time, arrested him on October 22 1962, put him on trial and executed him on May 16 the following year. In the subsequent fall-out, the role of the Cowells was revealed and they were speedily expelled from Moscow. Cowell had joined SIS in 1951, having been spotted by secret service recruiters at St Catharine's College, Cambridge, where he took a first-class degress in Russian and French. He was an ideal recruit; a reserved manner concealed a steely determination and a deep love of his country. Born in Sale, Cheshire, he had studied under Jesuits at St Bede's College, Manchester, before volunteering for the RAF as soon as he turned 18. After the war, he worked for GCHQ, the government agency which intercepts military and commercial communications for intelligence purposes. Cowell's task was listening to Soviet traffic. After training, he was posted abroad under Foreign Office cover, first to the political division of the allied control commission in Germany, and then, in 1958, to the British embassy in Jordan. In between these postings, he worked as a desk officer at SIS headquarters in London. After his expulsion from Moscow, Cowell served in Bonn from 1964-66, in Paris from 1972-76 and in Tel Aviv from 1978-81, when he took early retirement. Four years later, having found no satisfactory outlet for his energy, he returned to SIS to do research work in its archive. In 1988, the Foreign Office made him its adviser on the wartime work of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), helping historians assess its importance. The work gripped him, and on his final retirement in 1996 he became chairman of the historical sub-committee of the Special Forces Club. He also used his considerable artistic talent to design two memorial plaques, one in Westminister Abbey to commemorate the work of SOE, and the other at the site of Ravensbruck concentration camp, in memory of SOE women agents who were executed there. Cowell enjoyed Russian literature and translated several Russian authors, including Ivan Valeriy and Vladimir Tendryakov. He was made an MBE in the last new year's honours list. He leaves his wife, two sons and two daughters. Gervase Cowell, intelligence agent and diplomat, born August 4 1926; died May 2 2000",

The case of Tony Martin, jailed for killing an intruder, had highlighted the scandal of rural policing. \"Irrespective of whether Tony Martin was guilty or not, the problem is that communities such as his are unable to rely on the police,\" he said. The closure of local police stations for financial reasons had been disastrous, he added. The public were now more likely to see a traffic warden patrolling the streets than a police officer and it was an indication that the public was not getting the service it was entitled to. The call for a new royal commission on policing will be made by Mr Broughton just before Jack Straw addresses the conference on Wednesday morning. The last royal commission on the police reported in 1966 and led to a large number of amalgamations of small police forces. Mr Straw will be followed by a much trailed speech by the Conservative leader, William Hague, on Thursday morning. Mr Hague is expected to launch an onslaught on the liberal influence within the criminal justice system as well as confirming his plans to scrap the ancient \"double jeopardy\" rule whereby somebody cannot be tried twice for the same offence. \u0095 The police are guilty of institutional sexism with women discriminated against and patronised by male colleagues, a Police Federation meeting heard yesterday. Female officers were often passed over for promotion and given \"soft\" tasks, unsuitable uniforms and equipment, and inappropriate training. Jan Berry, general secretary of the Police Federation and a chief inspector in the Kent force, told a meeting in Brighton that women were still suffering discrimination despite high profile cases brought to tribunals in recent years. \"Just as we have institutional racism in the service so we have institutional sexism. \"Some of the different treatment is deeply set. There may be no intention to treat differently but the treatment is different and it is because we are female.\" The majority of women accepted the discrimination because they wanted to be \"part of the team. We weigh up the cost of putting our heads above the parapet and we decide that it is less painful to say nothing.\"",

      "bodyText": "The French and German ambassadors to London served notice yesterday that their countries intend to form the engine room of a small group of European Union states co-operating more closely than the rest. The move will alarm Britain which fears it could be excluded as pro-integration countries press ahead, using the cloak of enlargement of the EU to do so. The two diplomats told a Lords select committee hearing on Europe that the inner group of countries must be allowed to press ahead with closer co-operation without other member states vetoing their plans. Both men, speaking in advance of Thursday's Franco-German summit, said the idea of enhanced co-operation will form a central part of the agenda for the EU inter-governmental conference (IGC) in December. The summit is being billed as an attempt to relaunch the Franco-German alliance on European policy before France takes up the six-month EU presidency in June. Last week the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, called for a more integrationist agenda to deal with the enlargement of the EU to as many as 25 countries. Discussing the political impact of enlargement, the German ambassador, Dr Hans-Friedrich von Ploetz, told the Lords committee: \"Everyone should be able to join up, but such a big group needs some kind of engine.\" He claimed the EU would lose authority in the eyes of its citizens if progress was restricted to the pace of the slowest after enlargement. If integrationist states were banned from going further and quicker using the institutions of the EU, they would reach co-operation agreements outside the EU. The French ambassador, Daniel Bernard, cited education, culture, single currency and environment as areas where an inner group might be allowed to co-operate. Mr Bernard added that both Germany and France would be pressing at the IGC for majority voting to become the norm on the council of ministers. He said the veto should only be retained for issues regarded as constitutional importance to nation states. At present within the IGC there is almost no agreement on the areas where the existing national veto might be dropped.",

While this may be true for the majority of adopters, love may not be the only motivation, or even the strongest.</p> <p>Many seek to adopt to fulfil their own desire for a child; through pressure from others to conform to the family stereotype; or to satisfy a partner's needs.

Dr Carey states that those who adopt \"are motivated by love\". While this may be true for the majority of adopters, love may not be the only motivation, or even the strongest. Many seek to adopt to fulfil their own desire for a child; through pressure from others to conform to the family stereotype; or to satisfy a partner's needs. There will be a few who have more sinister motives - and one of the reasons for the rigorous examination of potential adopters is to exclude such people. Sadly, some slip through even with the high standards of assessment we use now: children have been abused in foster and adoptive homes as well as in residential care.

The case of the South Yorkshire businessman, whose tumour went undetected on 22 visits to 12 different doctors and is now inoperable, has been followed by others. The same Barnsley hospital which failed to diagnose the businessman's throat cancer is now accused of missing a lung tumour in a 52-year-old woman. The BBC Today programme found a third victim, in a different area, who was incorrectly diagnosed even with a tumour the size of a grapefruit. Where will it all end? And what do we do about a disease, which the latest studies show will develop in 40% of the present population, killing one out of four?</p> <p>There are two immediate points which can be made. The first, which these columns have long argued, was aired in our letter columns by Dr Ben Fox on Saturday: the need to correct unrealistically high public expectations, fueled by the belief that doctors can get their diagnosis right in every case. They can't. As Dr Fox noted, not all diseases have symptoms, not all symptoms relate to diseases, and any symptom has a number of causes. Even with all these caveats, however, the South Yorkshire case remains a scandal. As the cancer tsar, Mike Richards, conceded, Yorkshire medics did not pay enough attention to the patient's persistent symptoms.</p> <p>The second point to note is the danger of judging a service on a handful of horror cases. Over 250,000 new cancer cases occur every year. There are over 200 different types of cancers, but just four account for half of them - lung, breast, large bowel (colorectal) and prostate. Cancer numbers have risen as the treatment of old killers, like pneumonia and septicaemia, has become more effective. Rising life expectancy inevitably leads to more cancer: 65% of current cancers are diagnosed in people over 65.</p> <p>However, the low state of cancer services is not based on last week's horror stories but on a succession of comparative studies and the comments of cancer specialists working in the system. All comparative studies need to be handled with care, but the thrust is clear and not contested by ministers or most medics: Britain is near to the bottom of the European league in terms of treatment and survival rates - and even farther behind the US. Britain's survival rates for breast, prostate and colon cancers continue to improve, but still lag far behind Europe and the US. For colon cancer, for example, 36% of patients in the UK are still alive five years after diagnosis, compared to 48% in Germany and 60% in America.</p> <p>The good news is that no government has ever been more specific about tackling a disease. The health secretary identified cancer - along with heart disease and mental health - as his three main priorities on coming into office last year. The target could not be more specific: reducing cancer deaths in people under 75 by at least a fifth by 2010 compared with 1997. This would save 100,000 lives. Cynics may scoff but cancer death rates dropped by 16% between 1985-98. Ministers are not sitting back and expecting the trend to continue. They have asked the cancer tsar for a comprehensive plan. Already in the pipeline is a 50% increase in the nation's 400 oncologists; closer monitoring of hospitals; approval of new drugs for ovarian and breast cancer; and the reorganisation of cancer services, based on specialist centres. What is needed now is a speed-up of the reorganisation, a major investment in diagnostic and radiotherapy equipment, and national access to all approved drugs.</p>",

The patient, B, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given leave to seek judicial review of a decision his lawyers say is unlawfully preventing him from publicly asserting that he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice. He is being detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act at the top security hospital. Mr Justice Tucker, sitting in London, banned the media identifying him or reporting details of his offence. Paul Bowen, counsel for B, who has been held as a mental patient for more than 25 years, said the case raised important and fundamental issues of personal freedom and the right of mental patients to have statements put on the internet. In April last year the Broadmoor hospital authority decided to prevent B sending a five-page document by post which he ultimately wanted published on the internet. The hospital took action following concern that the victims of his offence and his own family would be distressed by widespread publicity. Mr Bowen argued that, even if there was a likelihood of distress, the hospital should not have exercised its discretion to withhold the document as that involved a restriction of B's freedom of expression, guaranteed both at common law and by article 10 of the European convention on human rights.

      "body": "<p>The national anthem of Sierra Leone starts like this: \"High we exalt thee, realm of the free,/ Great is the love we have for thee/ Firmly united ever we stand/ Singing thy praise, O native land.\" </p> <p>Sadly, these words about freedom and unity don't mean anything now in this small west African country. More than eight years of civil war have left more than 50,000 people dead. All law and order has ceased to exist and half of the population of 4.5 million have left their homes. In most areas, becoming a soldier in a rebel army is safer than staying an unarmed civilian at risk of murder, rape or kidnapping. And so far all attempts by foreign countries to help Sierra Leone have failed. </p> <p> <strong> Why is Sierra Leone in the news?</strong> </p> <p> A civil war has broken out over who has control of its vast reserves of diamonds. Last July it looked as if things might be getting better. A peace agreement between the three main rival groups was signed, which gave each a share in government and promised their war crimes would be forgiven. To make sure everything went to plan, the United Nations sent 11,000 troops to Sierra Leone to help police the country. </p> <p>But instead of being welcomed, the UN troops met fierce resistance from one of the rebel groups called the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). Units of the United Nations' force were attacked, robbed of their equipment and more than 300 of them were kidnapped. </p> <p>Fears that the civil war was starting again have caused panic in the population. Britain has just sent 700 heavily armed paratroops and several ships to help evacuate UK and European citizens. The fear is that they too will be attacked and become part of the conflict. </p> <p> <strong> Why did the United Nations mission go wrong?</strong> </p> <p> In Sierra Leone there are many proverbs, or sayings, that include animals. One goes: \"Don't try to scare a monkey with a dead baboon.\" Unfortunately, the poorly equipped and inexperienced UN force were just like \"a dead baboon\" when it came to trying to get the rebels to put down their guns and give up control of areas rich in diamonds. This has been a disaster for the UN and its secretary general, Kofi Annan. The UN already has a terrible record in Africa of not being able to stop this type of slaughter. </p> <p> <strong> Why is the UK getting involved?</strong> </p> <p> One answer is that they are trying to protect the ordinary people. Another is that if any western country were going to send troops, it should be Britain. Britain used to rule Sierra Leone and helped to make it into a country in the first place. In fact many of today's problems began because of the way in which Sierra Leone was set up. </p> <p>In 1787 Britain founded Freetown on the west African coast. Freed slaves made up most of its population. Later on, in the 19th century, when British forces conquered the tribes living away from the coast, it became the capital of the country. Sierra Leone is still a mass of different peoples. Between them they speak some 23 languages and hundreds of dialects. </p> <p>When Sierra Leone became independent of British rule in 1961, its leaders were mainly made up of a few powerful families descended from those original slaves. They set about robbing the country of its natural wealth - particularly the diamond fields discovered in the 1930s. Many people were angry at this. They felt they had no share in the wealth, and so the RUF was founded. It was led by Alfred Foday Sankoh, an ex-corporal and television cameraman. In 1991, the RUF started the uprising against the government that is going on today. </p> <p> <strong> How does such a poor country manage to fight such a costly war?</strong> </p> <p> The cost of the war has been met by diamond smuggling. The diamonds in Sierra Leone are alluvial - washed out of the rock and deposited by rivers - they don't need mining and they are easy to transport. </p> <p>One of the RUF's most important allies is President Charles Taylor of neighbouring Liberia. Liberia does not have many diamond deposits, but it is guessed that its current diamond exports are worth over $300m. According to Africa expert Comfort Ero: \"Taylor has provided a safe haven for RUF fighters and has helped to establish their trade in diamonds, in return for a large share of the profits.\" He thinks the RUF and the international criminal groups behind the smuggling want the civil war to keep going. </p> <p> <strong> What are the chances for peace?</strong> </p> <p> It is when the soldiers leave that the troubles will start. Many people are calling Sierra Leone a \"failed state\": a country that that doesn't work properly. It is now hard to imagine the leaders who signed the 1999 peace treaty truly working together. The population is terrified of the RUF rebels who have carried out acts of great brutality. Unless order is restored, Sierra Leone may be a threat to peace in west Africa.</p>",

To make sure everything went to plan, the United Nations sent 11,000 troops to Sierra Leone to help police the country. But instead of being welcomed, the UN troops met fierce resistance from one of the rebel groups called the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). Units of the United Nations' force were attacked, robbed of their equipment and more than 300 of them were kidnapped. Fears that the civil war was starting again have caused panic in the population. Britain has just sent 700 heavily armed paratroops and several ships to help evacuate UK and European citizens. The fear is that they too will be attacked and become part of the conflict. Why did the United Nations mission go wrong? In Sierra Leone there are many proverbs, or sayings, that include animals. One goes: \"Don't try to scare a monkey with a dead baboon.\" Unfortunately, the poorly equipped and inexperienced UN force were just like \"a dead baboon\" when it came to trying to get the rebels to put down their guns and give up control of areas rich in diamonds. This has been a disaster for the UN and its secretary general, Kofi Annan. The UN already has a terrible record in Africa of not being able to stop this type of slaughter. Why is the UK getting involved? One answer is that they are trying to protect the ordinary people. Another is that if any western country were going to send troops, it should be Britain. Britain used to rule Sierra Leone and helped to make it into a country in the first place. In fact many of today's problems began because of the way in which Sierra Leone was set up. In 1787 Britain founded Freetown on the west African coast. Freed slaves made up most of its population. Later on, in the 19th century, when British forces conquered the tribes living away from the coast, it became the capital of the country. Sierra Leone is still a mass of different peoples. Between them they speak some 23 languages and hundreds of dialects. When Sierra Leone became independent of British rule in 1961, its leaders were mainly made up of a few powerful families descended from those original slaves. They set about robbing the country of its natural wealth - particularly the diamond fields discovered in the 1930s. Many people were angry at this. They felt they had no share in the wealth, and so the RUF was founded. It was led by Alfred Foday Sankoh, an ex-corporal and television cameraman. In 1991, the RUF started the uprising against the government that is going on today. How does such a poor country manage to fight such a costly war? The cost of the war has been met by diamond smuggling. The diamonds in Sierra Leone are alluvial - washed out of the rock and deposited by rivers - they don't need mining and they are easy to transport. One of the RUF's most important allies is President Charles Taylor of neighbouring Liberia. Liberia does not have many diamond deposits, but it is guessed that its current diamond exports are worth over $300m. According to Africa expert Comfort Ero: \"Taylor has provided a safe haven for RUF fighters and has helped to establish their trade in diamonds, in return for a large share of the profits.\" He thinks the RUF and the international criminal groups behind the smuggling want the civil war to keep going. What are the chances for peace? It is when the soldiers leave that the troubles will start. Many people are calling Sierra Leone a \"failed state\": a country that that doesn't work properly. It is now hard to imagine the leaders who signed the 1999 peace treaty truly working together. The population is terrified of the RUF rebels who have carried out acts of great brutality. Unless order is restored, Sierra Leone may be a threat to peace in west Africa.",

      "body": "<p>The crisis at Rover and the announcement of Dagenham's closure as a car production plant will have a major impact on the aspirations of the government to create a learning society. Rover and Ford were in the vanguard of the movement to offer workers paid support for learning for personal development. Like many other employers they took training seriously, and both believed that learning \"leaks\" - skills and confidence gained in learning for pleasure - can be harnessed for the workplace.</p> <p>Ford's Dagenham plant, with its dedicated learning centre, has been a beacon of the learning society - with everything from family numeracy to plastering for beginners. </p> <p>These are not isolated examples, and illustrate a problem that threatens the government's commitment to learning for all. Despite the expansion of further and higher education by successive governments, and despite this government's welcome overhaul of post-school education, participation levels remain stubbornly low. Some of this can be explained by the 1990s' habit of robbing Peter to pay Paul - winding down community learning to expand courses leading to qualifications, at the expense of older people in particular. </p> <p>The shift from large scale employment to small, medium and tiny employers, and to the growth in self-employment has also had a major impact. While most big employers have a good record in staff development and training, far too many small scale enterprises don't. Almost every gain in participation in the formal sector is offset by changes in what happens at work. </p> <p>You can see this in the West Midlands, where overall participation fell in the 1990s, despite the rise in provision by universities, colleges and community providers alike.

      "bodyText": "The crisis at Rover and the announcement of Dagenham's closure as a car production plant will have a major impact on the aspirations of the government to create a learning society. Rover and Ford were in the vanguard of the movement to offer workers paid support for learning for personal development. Like many other employers they took training seriously, and both believed that learning \"leaks\" - skills and confidence gained in learning for pleasure - can be harnessed for the workplace. Ford's Dagenham plant, with its dedicated learning centre, has been a beacon of the learning society - with everything from family numeracy to plastering for beginners. These are not isolated examples, and illustrate a problem that threatens the government's commitment to learning for all. Despite the expansion of further and higher education by successive governments, and despite this government's welcome overhaul of post-school education, participation levels remain stubbornly low. Some of this can be explained by the 1990s' habit of robbing Peter to pay Paul - winding down community learning to expand courses leading to qualifications, at the expense of older people in particular. The shift from large scale employment to small, medium and tiny employers, and to the growth in self-employment has also had a major impact. While most big employers have a good record in staff development and training, far too many small scale enterprises don't. Almost every gain in participation in the formal sector is offset by changes in what happens at work. You can see this in the West Midlands, where overall participation fell in the 1990s, despite the rise in provision by universities, colleges and community providers alike. When Rover shrank its workforce from 180,000 to 36,000 more than 100,000 regular learning opportunities were lost. The people displaced by de-industrialisation recognise that learning makes a difference to your job prospects, but too many men cannot see themselves joining in. As one reported in a North Yorkshire study: \"College is a step up for women, but a step down for men.\" You learn at work or not at all. Where you work is as important as where you live to your chances of lifelong learning. Investors in People makes a demonstrable difference to firms, but countless thousands, of tiny, small and medium-sized firms don't take part, leaving their workers high and dry. Eight years ago Tony Blair, then Labour's spokesman on employment, was clear what needed to be done about this. He wrote then, in the Financial Times, \"We... do not believe a voluntary approach to training will work...

Let's say she is one of the million people promised an Individual Learning Account worth \u00a3175 by the government. She puts in a \u00a325 contribution and receives \u00a3150 of state cash and decides to spend the money on a basic computer accounting course. She gets a part-time job with a local voluntary body and gets some experience of running an accounts system. </p> <p>So far so good - but then Rachel looks at local pay rates and decides she should try to get an accountancy technician qualification. How does she get her hands on the money to fund a course which she knows will boost her future earnings and pension? Could she draw on the pension fund she has already contributed to before taking a career break? Her increased earnings in the future would rebuild her pension investment if only she could be a bit more flexible now... </p> <p>The government's offer of a million Individual Learning Accounts is a good start but does it go far enough to spark the kind of learning revolution which education pundits and economists alike think is necessary for the UK's international competitiveness? </p> <p>The Institute for Public Policy Research, a centre-left think-tank, believes more radical solutions are needed to give people access to the wealth they will generate over the lifetime of earning and saving. Everyone should have their own venture-capital fund. </p> <p>Take control of your life and career is the mantra of the growing army of personal development counsellors. Education and training is life-enhancing, empowering and one of the most powerful determinants of career success. Yet access to and funding of post-16 education and training remains substantially under the control of the state and employers. </p> <p>The philosophy of individual control of one's own destiny led to the 1980s personal investment drive, which saw the introduction of Peps and Tessas, and the privatisations which aimed to establish popular capitalism by offering small investors a share of state enterprises. But this did not carry over into education and training. </p> <p>Over the past five years, a succession of reports (Dearing on higher education, Kennedy on further education, Fryer on lifelong learning, the annual Competitiveness White Papers and the three reports of the National Skills Task Force) have argued that in the global knowledge economy, intellectual capital, skills and innovation will be more important than the traditional economic factors of capital, land and raw materials, and labour.</p> <p>Just as the stock-market value of knowledge-based businesses based on the intangible assets of intellectual property has overtaken that of businesses valued on physical assets, so national competitiveness will increasingly depend on human capital, and on people's ability to learn and to innovate by applying their learning. </p> <p>That means that nations cannot rely on a well-educated and innovative elite alone. The overall level of skills matters. Every report contrasting the UK and Germany, for instance, makes the point about Germany's superiority in technical and vocational training and the contribution of this to industrial performance. When jobs depend on minds rather than materials, education and training count for even more. </p> <p>As the Henley Centre for Forecasting has commented: \"In the global marketplace it is societies, not economies, that compete.\" Learning for all needs to be promoted by a partnership between individuals, state and employers. But the driving force must be individual motivation. People must want to learn and develop. And as with other forms of personal investment, a key way to motivate people is to give them more control and responsibility for their future. </p> <p>So how can individuals take more control of their own education and training? The answer is to extend the concept of the Individual Learning Account into a Personal Development Account (PDA) based on an individual's lifetime earnings and savings to give real leverage to the cash one has to invest in education and training. </p> <p>This could be done in phases, but the ultimate goal might be an integrated personal investment vehicle, one's own venture capital fund. A similar idea in America has the engaging acronym of USA (Universal Savings Account), and the Virgin One account appears to be moving in the same direction. </p> <p>There are a number of options for a PDA. The first is to route part of the funding of further and higher education through an individual student's account, and to manage the loan element as well through the PDA. Turning the present Student Loans Company into the type of Learning Bank envisaged by the Commission on Social Justice in 1994 would throw a more positive light on investing in higher education. And making funding follow student choice would increase the market responsiveness of further education colleges and universities. If colleges eventually set their own fees, the case for buyers to have control of both state and individual purchasing power in their own fund becomes even stronger. </p> <p>The second option is to look at an individual's lifetime earnings and savings, particularly in pension funds. Most of us are compelled to save in occupational pension schemes for 30 years or so of working life, but cannot access these accumulated funds until we retire - by which time it's a bit late to invest in learning for career development. </p> <p>This is a passive and inert form of investment. Increasingly, with the trend towards money-purchase pension schemes, there is the possibility that individuals might draw down some of those funds during their working lives. The evidence is that, overall, education and training investment is repaid in higher lifetime earnings, so individuals who draw down cash from their pension into their PDA can top up their pension afterwards from their increased pay. </p> <p>The third is to route employer training and development funds through an individual's PDA as part of the personal development plan process. Three options are: </p> <p>\u0095 a set percentage of total payroll to be spent on training and development </p> <p>\u0095 an opt-in model, similar to pension contributions, where if employees put an amount of their own money in, it automatically triggers an employer contribution, say on a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio </p> <p>\u0095 a disclosure requirement of amounts spent on training and development as part of a company's annual report, assessed against a sector benchmark. </p> <p>These options would significantly increase the volume of funds flowing through an ILA/PDA over an individual's lifetime. This in turn might increase the interest among financial institutions, who have so far been lukewarm towards the ILA concept. </p> <p>But what would be the incentives from the state? Corporation tax exemption for training and development spending is sufficient for employers. The government has already indicated that contributions through ILAs from employers will not count as taxable benefits for employees as long as all employees get access to training. Beyond this, there is a case for a tax credit for funds put into an ILA/PDA, just as you would invest in additional voluntary contributions to a pension or make donations to an educational charity. </p> <p>If we are serious about the massive cultural change in becoming a learning society, we need to signal the need for investment in intellectual capital. We need to make it at least as good to put your money into your brain as into your bank. The ILA/PDA concept brings the two together. </p> <p><strong>Different paths</strong></p> <p> <strong> Mark</strong> leaves school with average GCSEs and no wish to do further education. He gets a low-level sales assistant job, but finds he has a flair for selling. His company gives him advanced sales training and promotion, which is repaid in the orders he brings in. In his late 20s he begins to feel that lack of formal qualifications is a handicap and decides to do a certificate and then a diploma course in marketing. He puts \u00a3400 of his bonus into a Personal Development Account, triggering an \u00a3800 pay-in from his company and a \u00a3100 tax credit. This funds both courses and leads to further promotion and higher pay. </p> <p><strong> Sima</strong> is the first girl in her family to go to university, and she wants to avoid being a burden on her parents, who run a small shop. She organises her fee payments through her PDA, gets an excellent degree and a job with one of the major consulting firms. After three years, her employers suggest she does an MBA, and she borrows part of the cost of this through her PDA. By her late twenties her PDA is in deficit, but her salary has risen rapidly and she knows she can pay off the amount outstanding in a couple of years. </p> <p><strong> Rufus</strong> is a computer wizard and launches his own company designing games while he is still at school. He decides that all the staff should do something mind-expanding but not necessarily directly work-related to keep their creativity high, and guarantees a payment of \u00a3600 from the company into individuals' PDAs if they put in \u00a3200 themselves. Most take up the offer and plan their own learning programmes - with an annual award voted on by all staff to the one considered the most inventive.</p> <p>\u0095 Paying for Learning, published today by the Institute for Public Policy Research 0208 986 5488.

Beyond this, there is a case for a tax credit for funds put into an ILA/PDA, just as you would invest in additional voluntary contributions to a pension or make donations to an educational charity. If we are serious about the massive cultural change in becoming a learning society, we need to signal the need for investment in intellectual capital. We need to make it at least as good to put your money into your brain as into your bank. The ILA/PDA concept brings the two together. Different paths Mark leaves school with average GCSEs and no wish to do further education. He gets a low-level sales assistant job, but finds he has a flair for selling. His company gives him advanced sales training and promotion, which is repaid in the orders he brings in. In his late 20s he begins to feel that lack of formal qualifications is a handicap and decides to do a certificate and then a diploma course in marketing. He puts \u00a3400 of his bonus into a Personal Development Account, triggering an \u00a3800 pay-in from his company and a \u00a3100 tax credit. This funds both courses and leads to further promotion and higher pay. Sima is the first girl in her family to go to university, and she wants to avoid being a burden on her parents, who run a small shop. She organises her fee payments through her PDA, gets an excellent degree and a job with one of the major consulting firms. After three years, her employers suggest she does an MBA, and she borrows part of the cost of this through her PDA. By her late twenties her PDA is in deficit, but her salary has risen rapidly and she knows she can pay off the amount outstanding in a couple of years. Rufus is a computer wizard and launches his own company designing games while he is still at school. He decides that all the staff should do something mind-expanding but not necessarily directly work-related to keep their creativity high, and guarantees a payment of \u00a3600 from the company into individuals' PDAs if they put in \u00a3200 themselves. Most take up the offer and plan their own learning programmes - with an annual award voted on by all staff to the one considered the most inventive. \u0095 Paying for Learning, published today by the Institute for Public Policy Research 0208 986 5488. Tony Millns is chief executive of Arels, the association of UK English language schools. He worked with Ron Dearing on the reviews of the school curriculum, post-16 qualifications and higher education.",

      "body": "<p>In John's A-level year his father died suddenly from heart disease. As the final exams approached he confessed to feeling listless and to lacking motivation. \"I know what I'm capable of doing, and I'm not doing it,\" he said, but was reluctant to apply to the exam boards for a postponement. \"The trouble is, if I get off now, I might never get back on again.\"</p> <p>For Amy, the problem preying on her mind as she prepared for her GCSEs was the suicide of her best friend's father. She did not feel it was something the exam board would take into account but she was worried about whether she was supporting her friend adequately. \"I don't know how to deal with this - I've had no experience\". </p> <p>Nobody at school apart from Tom's close friends knew that his parents were in the throes of a divorce in the January before his GCSE exams. On the surface he was dismissive but soon admitted: \"It does get really bad sometimes - I have to admit it.\" </p> <p>Julie conceded that her part-time job was potentially harmful to her A-level chances as the time for revision approached, but maintained that she had only been allowed to stay at school by her single-parent mother on condition that she worked. \"I wouldn't want my mother to be paying to support me anyway.\" </p> <p>In all these cases, the final results were mediocre - in one case, disastrous - and not as good as general expectations of the students. Neither A-level student achieved the results necessary for their comparatively modest university/college offer targets. </p> <p>Exams are not a level playing field. My experience suggests that up to 25% of students face non-academic obstacles that can affect their chances, ranging from illness, bereavements of family or friends and students' responsibilities for caring for sick relatives, to parental divorce or strained relations, and family economic problems such as parents' redundancy and the need for students to work. </p> <p>In March, I launched <a href=\"http://members.aol.com/bharrisma/\" target=\"_NEW\">ExamAid</a>, a voluntary organisation to help students in these situations try to get through the year successfully rather than drop out and present exam boards with virtually insoluble problems. How do you assess the performance impact of a grandparent's death or a father's redundancy? And, given that someone will always abuse the system, what proof could you possibly ask for? </p> <p>ExamAid aims to provide help in areas which schools find difficult, such as helplines in out-of-school hours and a website featuring \"advicemail\" and networks for ill, isolated, part-time working or carer students, available 24 hours a day.

      "bodyText": "In John's A-level year his father died suddenly from heart disease. As the final exams approached he confessed to feeling listless and to lacking motivation. \"I know what I'm capable of doing, and I'm not doing it,\" he said, but was reluctant to apply to the exam boards for a postponement. \"The trouble is, if I get off now, I might never get back on again.\" For Amy, the problem preying on her mind as she prepared for her GCSEs was the suicide of her best friend's father. She did not feel it was something the exam board would take into account but she was worried about whether she was supporting her friend adequately. \"I don't know how to deal with this - I've had no experience\". Nobody at school apart from Tom's close friends knew that his parents were in the throes of a divorce in the January before his GCSE exams. On the surface he was dismissive but soon admitted: \"It does get really bad sometimes - I have to admit it.\" Julie conceded that her part-time job was potentially harmful to her A-level chances as the time for revision approached, but maintained that she had only been allowed to stay at school by her single-parent mother on condition that she worked. \"I wouldn't want my mother to be paying to support me anyway.\" In all these cases, the final results were mediocre - in one case, disastrous - and not as good as general expectations of the students. Neither A-level student achieved the results necessary for their comparatively modest university/college offer targets. Exams are not a level playing field. My experience suggests that up to 25% of students face non-academic obstacles that can affect their chances, ranging from illness, bereavements of family or friends and students' responsibilities for caring for sick relatives, to parental divorce or strained relations, and family economic problems such as parents' redundancy and the need for students to work. In March, I launched ExamAid, a voluntary organisation to help students in these situations try to get through the year successfully rather than drop out and present exam boards with virtually insoluble problems. How do you assess the performance impact of a grandparent's death or a father's redundancy? And, given that someone will always abuse the system, what proof could you possibly ask for? ExamAid aims to provide help in areas which schools find difficult, such as helplines in out-of-school hours and a website featuring \"advicemail\" and networks for ill, isolated, part-time working or carer students, available 24 hours a day. There is also new research on the extent and nature of the problems in specific areas and the kinds of difficulties students are experiencing with part-time employment. Regular magazine publications will list resources on such problems as bereavement, provide information on revision material that students can use entirely at home and report back on what research is suggesting. While some people have misgivings about voluntary organisations, it's difficult to see how else some of these problems can be approached - even present expectations can't demand 24-hour attention from year heads and pastoral tutors, and most schools haven't the time or resources to do detailed research into these problems. It's also true that many students, like their elders, do not like mixing their work and home lives and are inclined to look for out-of-school solutions to out-of-school problems.

      "body": "<p>Three students from Queen Mary and Westfield College, London, withdrew from their studies last February to train abroad and eventually engage in \"jihad\" - the holy war. They are the latest in an increasing number of British Muslim students who have been recruited from campuses by extremist Islamic parties to train abroad and fight in regions like Kosovo, Chechnya and Kashmir.</p> <p>Such recruitment, which has been going on for more than a decade, has attracted a large number of students over the years, some of whom have actually fought in different war zones and died. </p> <p>Students as young as 16 are known to have been recruited for military training abroad, often without their parents knowing anything about it. </p> <p>The Queen Mary students, two of whom were studying computer science and the other engineering, were recruited by the extremist party Al-Muhajiroun, which is active in British campuses throughout the country, and which has been banned by several universities for its extreme views. </p> <p>The founder of Al-Muhajiroun, Sheikh Omar Bakri-Muhammad, based in London, personally arranged the recruitment of the three students through his contacts in Britain and abroad. </p> <p>Sheikh Bakri-Muhammad, who founded the party in Saudi Arabia in 1983, says it is the duty of all Muslims to engage in jihad. He said: \"I believe in the divine cause for Muslims to struggle.\" </p> <p>Al-Muhajiroun, which has a network of centres around the world, is divided into two wings, said Sheik Bakri. \"There is the Da'wah (propagation) network, and there is the Jihad Network,\" he added. It is the Jihad Network of the party that recruits people for military campaigns, while the Da'wah wing \"spreads the word of Islam\" through lectures, conferences, stalls and leaflets. </p> <p>It is the Da'wah Network that attracts students to the party in campuses, as universities are key venues for lectures and talks. Students interested in the party become members, after which they are told of the possibility of engaging in military struggles \"for the sake of Islam\". </p> <p>The president of the National Union of Students, Andrew Pakes, has described the military recruitment of Al-Muhajiroun and other parties as \"morally reprehensible\". He said: \"I condemn the behaviour utterly. It is morally wrong to recruit students via the universities to become involved in paramilitary training and campaigns of violence.\" </p> <p>Pakes admitted that the NUS, which has banned Islamic parties in many campuses around the country for reasons of anti-Semitism and homophobia, was never aware of such military recruitment. </p> <p>He promised that the NUS would exercise a \"no-platform policy\" for any parties that engaged in such activities. \"I think I'd be encouraging the NUS to be on the lookout for such recruitment,\" he said. </p> <p>It is difficult, however, to spot parties like Al-Muhajiroun recruiting students, as it is done with great secrecy. Although the Da'awah Network of Al-Muhajiroun openly condemns Israel, Russia's actions in Chechnya and India's stance in Kashmir, and calls on Muslims to fight towards creating a global Islamic state (khilafah), it seldom discloses its Jihad wing to the wider public. </p> <p>Members of the party who want to go abroad and become Mojahedin (jihad warriors) contact key party figures. They introduce them to sources in Britain that have connections with guerrilla training camps in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. </p> <p>Sheikh Bakri-Muhammad admitted that there is a global network of agents with connections to the military camps, some of whom work from Britain. </p> <p>Abdullah (not his real name) was a student at a London University college when he became attracted to Islamic parties in his final year. \"In my final year I turned towards Islam. I listened to a few people and groups, visiting speakers, etc. That helped my Islamic awakening,\" he says. </p> <p>Since then he has become a devoted member of an Islamic party, which he wouldn't name. Through the party he has gone abroad for military training, and returned to England after completing it six months ago. </p> <p>\"There are quite a few people in the UK who can arrange for you to go to the camps,\" he says. The route the recruits take to the military camps from countries like Britain are complicated, full of stops and changes to prevent authorities from tracing them. </p> <p>\"Often you would go from England to France, and from there to another country, and so on,\" he says. \"Then once you are in the right country you would go by car or rail to a specified destination, and then be guided to the actual camps. </p> <p>\"The majority of spaces are filled by students. Even 16- to 17-year-olds skip schools to go on training.\" Often people of 16 or 17 lie to their parents, saying they are going on a summer holiday to places like America. But they actually go to training and return to England a few weeks later, so their parents still think they they are just back from holiday. </p> <p>\"You see, the students actually do go to America, just as they say to their parents. But from America they would fly to somewhere else and eventually to the camps. America would be part of their route, the connecting flight,\" he said. </p> <p>Abdullah also said that sometimes the families know about the students' involvement and are usually supportive of it. </p> <p>The military camps are normally run by Muslim soldiers who have defected from their national armies. They train the recruits as well as providing them with free food and board. \"The only thing that the recruits pay for are their flights,\" says Abdullah. \"In every training camp there is the Amir-ul-Jihad [jihad leader], who is in charge of the entire camp.\" </p> <p>After finishing the training, the Amir-ul-Jihad will ask the recruits if they actually want to go on to fight. \"You are given the choice to fight or come back to the UK to recruit other people,\" says Abdullah. </p> <p>He denies that coercion or force is ever used to ensure the recruits go on to fight: \"You always have a choice.\" However, he admits that sometimes the Amir-ul-Jihad will encourage the better recruits to fight, and that some students get killed in battle. He himself knows someone who has become \"shahid\" (martyr). \"He fought in the Bosnian war. But he did not die there. He went to another war zone and became shahid,\" says Abdullah. </p> <p>Osman Ali, who lives in the London suburbs, is another recruit who has returned from training somewhere in Europe. </p> <p>\"I've had lots of contacts who have become shahid in the battlefield in Chechnya,\" he says. \"There have also been many in Kashmir.\" He points out that Kashmir is a popular choice for the many British recruits, because of their Pakistani origin. </p> <p>Once the recruits are ready, they joint armies such as the International Islamic Front (also founded by Sheikh Bakri-Muhammad) and Harekat-ul-Mujahidun, under whose command they fight. In Kashmir, Osman says, \"often the Pakistani army knows we are fighting alongside them. It monitors our camps, but never crack down on it.\" </p> <p>Osman and Abdullah both maintain the camps are funded internationally through donations, by groups or individuals. \"In some locations [camps] you even get funding from Osama bin Laden\" says Abdullah. \"He doesn't just help financially, but also with military expertise.\" Bin Laden not only assists other mojahedin groups but also has his own independent army, also called the International Islamic Front. </p> <p> It is still not clear why so many British Muslim students are attracted by Islamic extremist parties and the idea of jihad. For believers like Abdullah and Osman Ali, however, it is a religious duty to propagate Islam and defend fellow Muslims anywhere in the world. They know that the military warfare they are engaged in may be called terrorism by the British government. But they are convinced that they are obeying a higher authority. </p> <p>\"The law could go to hell,\" says Abdullah. \"On the one hand I have Tony Blair to follow, and on the other my creator. So who do you want me to follow? For me it's a divine obligation to fight.\" </p> <p>This personal belief is also what the extremist parties preach, so it's difficult to know what is faith and what is indoctrination. Sheikh Bakri-Muhammad has no qualms about recruiting people to go to war. To him \"sovereignty is for God, not for people\". </p> <p>He said Al-Muhajiroun's sole purpose is to \"establish the Islamic state,\" through both propagation and jihad. \"I want Britain to become an Islamic state. I want to see the flag of Islam raised in 10 Downing Street.\" </p> <p>To Sheikh Bakri-Muhammad, Islamising Britain is a \"divine duty\". He regularly preaches Islamic globalisation in his lectures and in party literature. His views may seem extreme to moderate Muslims, yet Al-Muhajiroun is one of the largest Islamic parties in Britain, and is attracting more and more young people. </p> <p>Andrew Pakes thinks that the network of Islamic groups is strong, which makes them effective: \"I think the links between Islamic groups in Britain are greater than any other groups.\" And their rhetoric is powerful: \"I imagine it has to be some intoxicating force of arguments.\" </p> <p>Abdul Rehman Salim, the president of the Society of Muslim Students, gives another reason: \"A lot of Muslims have been disillusioned by the Gulf war. There has been a rise [in recruitment] since that war.\" </p> <p>The wars in the nineties certainly turned a lot of Muslim students towards the extremist parties. It was during the Bosnian conflict that Abdullah himself \"turned towards Islam\" - at the time he was in his final year at university. </p> <p>Pakes has said that individual student unions can ban any Islamic parties that engage in paramilitary recruitment, and that he will warn the NUS of them. </p> <p>\"The unions are not for paramilitary recruitment but for the cultural and educational needs of students,\" he says. \"Anyway, such recruitment contravenes equality policies, since they only take certain types of recruits [namely Muslim] and not others. This is why the NUS nationally advocated the removal of British Army recruitment because of their policy on homosexuality.\" </p> <p>Although Queen Mary and Westfield College declined to comment on the three students who withdrew from their studies, it nevertheless said: \"We have a policy of freedom of speech, as required by successive education acts. In terms of activity on campus there is therefore a presumption against banning, provided activities are within the law and not a threat to college students, staff or property. </p> <p>\"But the college is strongly opposed to any behaviour which creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment for work or study, whether on sexual or racial grounds. Specifically, the college prohibits the posting and/or distribution of notices, signs or posters which are offensive, intimidating, threatening, indecent or illegal. Certain groups which may cause a security risk on campus are also banned from hiring rooms on college premises.\" </p> <p>Pakes stresses that banning extremist Islamic groups recruiting students was in the best interest of Muslim students: \"It's not about attacking Muslims, but taking care of the welfare of Muslim students.\" </p> <p>And yet banning Islamic parties such as Al-Muhajiroun, the Society of Muslim Students and Hizb-ut-Tahrir can prove ineffectual. </p> <p>Abdul Rehman Salim says that when his society is banned from a student union \"we use different society names to hold meetings. When the audience is keen to listen, we tell them who we really are.\" </p> <p>Sheikh Bakri-Muhammad says that when a student union bans Al-Muhajiroun \"we use the names of societies, like the Pakistani Society, the Bangladeshi Society, etc, to get in.\" </p> <p>\"When a college like the London School of Economics bans us, we set up stalls outside the campus, where the students can reach us but the authorities can do nothing,\" he adds. These methods are used by the parties to get into campuses where they are already banned, such as Manchester and Leeds.</p>",

The morning all this broke there was no one there, it was quite remarkable - literally no one. That said something about the shock that was felt around here.\"</p> <p>Owen is deputy headteacher at Frankley Community High School, six miles from the centre of Birmingham, which has recently been under the long shadow of uncertainty cast by the Rover car factory and the protracted negotiations over its future. Last week's well-publicised \u00a310 sale has saved jobs for now, but for how long? </p> <p>With 50% of children on free school meals and nearly half its mainly white, working-class intake coming from homes where regular employment is a rarity, Frankley is the kind of place where raising educational standards is hard enough at the best of times. But with more than 20% unemployment, and the area's most significant employer on the brink of closure for the last couple of months, the difficulties faced by its hard-pressed teaching staff have merely increased. </p> <p>\"We are always going to have problems here,\" says the school's full-time learning mentor, Charmian \"Charlie\" Nex. \"But this has just added an extra weight to it. This time of year we've got exams coming up and we're struggling to keep the children going, and then it's like, 'oh, we've been dealt another blow'. The school has been very unsettled.\" </p> <p>In 1997, with attendance among its 450 pupils down to 74%, and with only 5% achieving five or more A to C grades at GCSE, Frankley was placed under the dreaded special measures. But two years later, funding from the government's Excellence in Cities project enabled the headteacher, Sue Bates, to employ Charlie to work with its most disaffected and underachieving pupils. </p> <p>Together with what Owen calls \"a new ethos of aspiration,\" the school has dragged itself up to the official status of \"serious weaknesses\" - last summer, 21% achieved five or more A-Cs, and attendance has risen to 87.5% - only to see the community hit by this new source of instability. </p> <p>\"There is a massive, grey cloud around that is making people, especially our pupils, wonder 'well, where am I going to end up?',\" says Bates. \"Before the Longbridge thing broke, we had been trying to establish a new agenda for the school and we're probably far enough down the road not to have all our good work undermined by this episode. But in the community around us there is a real feeling of uncertainty.\" </p> <p>Charlie has certainly noticed it. Much of her work involves chasing up absent pupils and encouraging them back to the classroom. Often it means trying to persuade sceptical parents of the value of school to their children's futures. She reckons her workload has increased by something like 10%-20% in the last few weeks. </p> <p>\"The atmosphere from the Rover stuff is definitely affecting them,\" she says. \"You can see the older children thinking, 'what's the point?' even more than they used to. A lot of year 11 children have been dropping out and that must be partly a result of the general feeling - you know, 'if jobs can disappear that easily, why bother?' \" </p> <p>\"This is an area of poverty anyway,\" says Owen. \"Of those parents that do have jobs, many are part-time or temporary. And our attempts to raise standards are not always supported by them. But now, even those children who have seen their dad with a job that pays OK are thinking that even that rug might be pulled from under them.\" </p> <p>A large number of parents of Frankley pupils work at the Rover plant, in a few cases both parents. Many others work for one of a handful of nearby factories that supply parts to Rover, or at the retail park just down the road which partly relies on the spending power of Rover workers and their families. It's no coincidence that the last couple of months has seen a sharp increase in the number of applications for free school meals. </p> <p>\"You can feel the anxieties of the parents through the children,\" says Owen. \"They're obviously worried about their futures and about what might happen in their families if they suddenly have to face not having enough money.\" </p> <p>Year 10 pupils Krystle Priestley and Kelly Walton are both aiming for higher education but are acutely aware of what's happening. \"My mum talks about it all the time,\" says Krystle. \"Every day she'll tell you the latest news. And you can hear other kids at school talking about it, worrying about their dads' jobs or whatever.\" </p> <p> In fact, several members of school staff have partners who work at Longbridge. And there are direct links to what's called the Rover Learning Centre, which in the past has invited pupils to tour the factory and talk to employees about their jobs. Usually, in June, five or six pupils would go to the plant for two weeks' work experience, and workers go to the school to do mentoring sessions with children, talking to them about the personal qualities needed in the world of work. This year, all that has gone. </p> <p>Year 10 pupil Mark Williams had applied to do work experience at Rover this year. \"I'll just have to go somewhere else,\" he says. That's not so bad for someone who hopes to be an actor, rather than a car worker. But about 10% of Frankley's school leavers usually apply to do apprenticeships at the plant every year. \"I haven't had any requests from Rover for references this year,\" says Owen. \"Normally there's quite a few by now. No one has said directly they are not going to apply, but many of them clearly thought it would close, or at least they think it will be a less viable employer around here.\" </p> <p>If anything, the staff at Frankley feel an even greater sense of responsibility than before. \"As a community school, I recognise that we are one of the first ports of call when the community experiences difficulties,\" says head Sue Bates. \"We actually take the children away from the area where the tension is sharpest, which is in the home. For some children, the school is the most comfortable environment they've got at the moment. So although we might be more proactive in getting them in here, in terms of how we work we have tried to be as normal as possible.\" </p> <p>In the long term, whatever happens to jobs at Longbridge, Bates feels there may be a positive side to the turmoil. \"If it actually makes some people think it is better to stay on at school, rather than assuming there will be a job out there, maybe there will be a less cavalier attitude to education. It will take some time, but for some, what is happening at Longbridge could throw into sharper relief the idea that they do need education.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The relationship between the headteacher and governing body of a school is like a precious and delicate Faberg\u00e9 egg - and can be just as rare. It is the key that allows schools to unlock the potential of both adults and children. It is made up of mutual trust and respect, and is worked upon and embellished over time. Its fundamental elements are a shared understanding, clear information, common purpose and the ability to be constructively critical without taking or giving offence. In short, it's a genuine partnership. Every school should have a Faberg\u00e9 egg, or be creating one. But how do you produce this much sought-after asset? \u0095 Step one: the design process.

Tom Kark, counsel for the GMC, told the hearing that it was insufficient to take the word of a 15-year-old that she had not had sexual intercourse. The girl was taken to a GP surgery in Pontnewydd, south Wales, where Dr Thomas was then practising, in late May or early June 1995, after she told her mother that she had missed her period. She told her mother she could not be pregnant. Mrs A believed her. Mrs A claimed Dr Thomas saw her up to five times before she collapsed in November 1995. The doctor disputed the number of visits, but conceded there was at least one occasion when she had failed to examine the girl. Mr Kark said Miss A's weight soared and her face, body and legs began to swell so much so that she could not put on her shoes to go to school.
