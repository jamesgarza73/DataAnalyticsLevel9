These master percussionists have played with Echo and the Bunnymen and inspired everyone from the Clash to Joni Mitchell. Perhaps most famously, they bequeathed the Adam and the Ants tribal drum sound that lit up the charts in the 1980s. Making a rare British visit, they are greeted with hero-worship, and respond with a performance worthy of their status. </p> <p>The drumming starts even before they hit the stage, as vast waves of rolling thunder emanate from their dressing room. When the 12 masters walk on barefoot, in colourful robes, playing their drums on their heads, you can just about hear gasps above their tribal magic, which, unamplified, is louder than Deep Purple. </p> <p>Over the next 50 minutes, none of the performers speaks (although there are plenty of whoops and cries), which adds to the mystique, and emphasises the beat as star. That beat has been handed down for generations, originally accompanied the Burundi king on his travels, and is rooted in agricultural ritual. The drums themselves are great hollowed-out logs covered in cow skin, each a different size and tuning, and beaten with sticks the size of an arm. </p> <p>With all the drummers smiling away, despite one of them carrying a spear, they launch into the rhythm of Kings of the Wild Frontier by Adam and the Ants, complete with \"heyoh-heyoh\"s and clacking stick sounds. This is probably the mythical \"perfect beat\", which makes it a wonder that it hasn't been further pillaged by the dance generation. There is simply so much to marvel at: the spectacle of flailing limbs; the repetitive, primeval power; the beat's intricate construction; and the sheer physical exertion that must be necessary to play it. </p> <p>As the pounding reaches a peak, band and audience reach something like a trance state, which may explain why the former are able to leap repeatedly into the air without missing a beat. Finally, they put their instruments back on their heads and depart as they arrived, leaving a piece of Burundi in the heart of Salford and a near riot at the CD stall. </p> <p>\u0095 The Drummers of Burundi play the Hexagon, Reading tonight (0118-960 6060), then tour. </p>",

Perhaps most famously, they bequeathed the Adam and the Ants tribal drum sound that lit up the charts in the 1980s. Making a rare British visit, they are greeted with hero-worship, and respond with a performance worthy of their status. The drumming starts even before they hit the stage, as vast waves of rolling thunder emanate from their dressing room. When the 12 masters walk on barefoot, in colourful robes, playing their drums on their heads, you can just about hear gasps above their tribal magic, which, unamplified, is louder than Deep Purple. Over the next 50 minutes, none of the performers speaks (although there are plenty of whoops and cries), which adds to the mystique, and emphasises the beat as star. That beat has been handed down for generations, originally accompanied the Burundi king on his travels, and is rooted in agricultural ritual. The drums themselves are great hollowed-out logs covered in cow skin, each a different size and tuning, and beaten with sticks the size of an arm. With all the drummers smiling away, despite one of them carrying a spear, they launch into the rhythm of Kings of the Wild Frontier by Adam and the Ants, complete with \"heyoh-heyoh\"s and clacking stick sounds. This is probably the mythical \"perfect beat\", which makes it a wonder that it hasn't been further pillaged by the dance generation. There is simply so much to marvel at: the spectacle of flailing limbs; the repetitive, primeval power; the beat's intricate construction; and the sheer physical exertion that must be necessary to play it. As the pounding reaches a peak, band and audience reach something like a trance state, which may explain why the former are able to leap repeatedly into the air without missing a beat. Finally, they put their instruments back on their heads and depart as they arrived, leaving a piece of Burundi in the heart of Salford and a near riot at the CD stall. \u0095 The Drummers of Burundi play the Hexagon, Reading tonight (0118-960 6060), then tour.",

Who cared that the two platoons of chaps enacted their private war to reverberating echoes bouncing round the cavernous concrete suburban emptiness. They have done so annually in one of Christendom's oldest sportin' fixtures - first played at The Oval in 1878 when the matelots won by a goal and a try to a goal, probably because they had an extra man as the Khakis' skipper, the nicely named Captain RA Ballantyne RA, had been posted to garrison Sudan that very morning. </p> <p>Saturday's match - for the Willis Carroon Trophy, wouldn't you know - might have offered spiritual balm for the diehard old union ghosts which had been wafting around in anguish only the Saturday before when their tabernacle of righteousness was used to stage the celebrations of their blighted enemy, in the shape of the rugby league Challenge Cup final. </p> <p>Such purgatorial distress will be temporary, anyway. Soon those reactionary wraiths of rugby past will realise they have secured the future, and totally routed their traitorous antagonists of more than a century. To my mind, these last few months have seen rugby league totally doomed. It is only a matter of time - and not much of that, either - before rugby league in Britain is forced to merge with a voracious union.

Who cared that the two platoons of chaps enacted their private war to reverberating echoes bouncing round the cavernous concrete suburban emptiness. They have done so annually in one of Christendom's oldest sportin' fixtures - first played at The Oval in 1878 when the matelots won by a goal and a try to a goal, probably because they had an extra man as the Khakis' skipper, the nicely named Captain RA Ballantyne RA, had been posted to garrison Sudan that very morning. Saturday's match - for the Willis Carroon Trophy, wouldn't you know - might have offered spiritual balm for the diehard old union ghosts which had been wafting around in anguish only the Saturday before when their tabernacle of righteousness was used to stage the celebrations of their blighted enemy, in the shape of the rugby league Challenge Cup final. Such purgatorial distress will be temporary, anyway. Soon those reactionary wraiths of rugby past will realise they have secured the future, and totally routed their traitorous antagonists of more than a century. To my mind, these last few months have seen rugby league totally doomed. It is only a matter of time - and not much of that, either - before rugby league in Britain is forced to merge with a voracious union. I give it five years, and that is being generous. While the Challenge Cup final plays odd herald these days for the game's summer Super League to get into its stride, the spiteful and bickering committee rooms of the English union club game is wrapping up its season with a barmy series of championship play-offs, as if no one knew who the out-and-out uncontested champions are.

      "body": "<p>Britannia - cool, tolerant and pragmatic. An island embarrassed by enthusiasm and sceptical about ideology - its inhabitants more interested in gardening than politics. The national myths of self-esteem are part of the mental landscape. Blairist, technocratic and apolitical, is only the latest chapter in that tome of what it means to be British. </p> <p>But the book of British history needs endless rewriting and revision for successive generations. And the earliest chapters in the section on what it means to be modern shows a different, unsettling account of the matter. This, after all, is the country that went to civil war for the sake of ideas about law and obe dience. We invented republicanism in modern politics and, behind Philadelphia in 1776 and Paris in 1789, there stands the scaffolding on which a short man born in Dunfermline was beheaded in 1649. </p> <p>Macaulay's leather-jacketed heir is back on the screen to explain to us why Britain collapsed into very un-British anarchy. The camera work is as beautiful as ever; all swooping and tracking shots over a landscape by turns pastoral and dramatic, elysian and craggy. This is a series whose richness of imagery is also a landscape of the mind. </p> <p>But Simon Schama's resumption of his narrative (The British Wars) is elegiac and compassionate rather than triumphalist. In his history of the French revolution, Citizens, he took no hostages in his bleak view of the event that for the liberal-left invented democracy. For Schama it was a school for tyrants, a regressive catastrophe which invented new refinements in political cruelty. 1789 was a mistake that impeded the evolution of a society that had been doing rather nicely thank you in the 1780s. And here again there's a tolerance towards Britain's own ancien r\u00e9gime. </p> <p>Schama is no early Stuart apologist. Charles I, in one of his many happy phrases, was \"constitutionally incapable of being a constitutional monarch\". But both camera and language collude elegantly in explaining what Charles I was about: the dream of unity. The fact that it was a vision so rooted in aesthetics makes the visuals work. Cartography guides the viewer too. John Speed's 67 maps of Britain show the early Stuart optimism about a united Kingdom - and it was an inspiration to pick up on Speed's description of Edgehill as another Eden. The Eden that turned into Golgotha. </p> <p>All history - bathetically - is contemporary history. How could it be otherwise. The word itself means enquiry - and enquiry is rooted in the here and now. In taking us to the there and then, Schama is showing us that there is a unity in British history, but only in the sense of there being recurring questions - rather than a constitution set in stone and a national character that keeps on singing \"there'll always be a Britain\". </p> <p>The Stuarts had three thrones to fill: in Ireland, Scotland and England. What the English claim as their \"civil war\" was also a conflict between the three countries. And those tensions remain even in a post- devolutionary age. Behind the poll tax first visited on the Scots by Thatcher there stands Charles's imposition of the Prayer Book on a resistant Calvinist race. Ireland in this story erupts with a melancholy-on-cue quality, with wars of propaganda and atrocities - real and imagined. </p> <p>Schama's history shows that events suck and character determines. His civil war builds on some revisionist work that maintains that this catastrophe started as a quarrel among the toffs. There's no embryonic class consciousness of revolutionary agents visible, waiting anachronistically to be born into bourgeois life. What we have is a collection of country gentlemen who happened to be very stubborn about law, had a few hand-me-down truisms to hang on to about the Magna Carta - and a deep distaste for European Catholicism </p> <p>Charles was the real revolutionary - the one who seemed to have the little bits of Britain in his hand. He was at the heart of Europe, where the most dynamic model of government was that of absolutist kingship. Those silly myths about the king as father of his people were rooted in pre- democratic reality. </p> <p>In a way Schama's is a very conservative view of what happened in a half-century of constitutional conflict He shows that Euro-scepticism was not born at Maastricht and that the arguments have never gone away. </p> <p>There's a great sense of drama and involvement as the series' second half gets into its stride - involving though Schama's first instalment had been as he swooped down to squint at the sceptred isle from the Picts to Elizabeth. And it comes through in the compassion charged with understanding. The war was about allegiance - and so the diptych (one of many) is created on screen of the Verneys - the father being Charles's standard bearer at Edgehill while the son swore an oath to Parliament. </p> <p>Psychology is here in abundance, and it all works because this is something at which television - that stripper of the persona - is adept. We see the suit of armour that had belonged to Prince Henry, Charles's elder, more glamorous brother who had been more of a jousting-jock than the aloof aesthete. Charles tried it on for size after his brother died but found it too big. There's Henrietta Maria, our own Marie Antoinette - less sexy but just as silly - a sallow-skinned airhead airbrushed into glam by Van Dyck's deceitful palette. </p> <p>And there are eyes everywhere - the soulful ones of the court which history tends to romanticise because they were born to rule but now seem born losers. But we also see the harder ones of Black Tom Stafford, the earl of Wentworth, the man Charles betrayed by approving his execution, the man who would have been the king's man of iron, the gauleiter to rule a united kingdom. </p> <p>Puritans come in for some roughing-up. And there's a touch of Merrie-England romanticism at work in Schama's criticism that these anti-ritualistic people of the Book \"deprived the ordinary of colour and ceremony\". But he's excellent in his assessment of the appeal of being one of the elect. The charm of minority status when you're an avant-garde ideologist is that it means you must be special, chosen and therefore right simply because there aren't many of you. It's good to be in Gideon's army as a small, self-justifying band on the march. As right and as authoritarian as that piggy-eyed dogmatist Archbishop Laud. </p> <p>It all looked good for Charles's \"playground of the gods\" for a while in the 1630s says Schama, looking up to camera, and then he had to come down to earth. The expense of war on the continent meant that taxation had to be raised and approved by parliament. Parliament and the pound are twin brothers, then as now. What emerged out of the struggle was for a long time confused. Schama's is no Whiggish inevitability and morality tale of a parliament that was always rising and planning initiatives. Charles could have got away with it - and Britain could perhaps have had good art rather than marginal water-colourists, decent food rather than convenience fodder, and a House of Commons only occasionally summoned, rather than our regular feast of delights by the Thames. </p> <p>There was no script of inevitability saying \"go forth and be democratic\". The men who died holding those pikes that advance so darkly in the mel\u00e9e of the battlefield wrought more than they knew. History as poker player has more than one hidden hand. Pym Hampden and the rest were not proto-democrats but cross and rich, the products of deference. A world turned upside down was not what they were about. </p> <p>Afer 1660 it all seemed over, \"the good old cause\" dead and buried. It seemed to survive only in the tragic cadences of Milton the blind poet hearing \"the sons of Belial all flushed with wine\" on London's Restoration streets as men in tights came back to play. </p> <p>As a historian, Schama has always shown that the division between analysis and narrative is a researcher's contrivance. Here he fuses both tools with a matchless skill. His insistently nodding head (which goes against the tired canons of on-screen delivery) communicates the zeal that led to war in the isles and on the hearth, in the courts of law and in the court of silks and taffeta. </p> <p>And in the final moments we see him on Edgehill, the battlefield where Edmund Verney's body was never found. How green and pleasant a land the killing field looks now. So British and National Trust. But beneath it all as the images blur, blend and cross over, the mind's eye can see the blood that has seeped into the turf, sense the suffering of those who fulfilled a role in a terrible British tragedy, and weep. This is how it should be done. Sometimes there's more to telly than meets the eye. </p> <p>\u0095 A History Of Britain, Tuesday, 9pm, BBC2</p>",

      "body": "<p>David Healy was looking forward to moving to Canada. For the British psycho-pharmacologist, author of the definitive history of antidepressant drugs, the invitation to take up a post at the prestigious University of Toronto made absolute sense. Apart from the academic advantages, his claims that the cult drug Prozac and its copycat sisters can make some people commit suicide were taking him to the US increasingly often to testify on behalf of bereaved families against the drug companies. </p> <p>It wasn't to happen. Healy's move across the Atlantic, closer to the field of battle over some of the bestselling drugs of all time, has been scuppered in what some see as just the latest skirmish in a dirty war to stop him and others speaking out. </p> <p>The stakes are huge. The pharmaceutical group Eli Lilly made $2.6bn (\u00a31.8bn) from Prozac last year alone and is pulling out all the stops to register the drug for new uses now that its patent is at an end. It has just succeeded in getting it renamed and repackaged as Sarafem, for severe premenstrual tension, which will keep the profits rolling in until 2007. But if Healy is right, there is a risk that a minority of people on Prozac will take their own lives. He calculates that a quarter of a million people worldwide have tried to commit suicide because of Prozac and that 25,000 have succeeded. For the manufacturers of the SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as this class of drug is called) Healy's work is enormously damaging. </p> <p>Eli Lilly claims there is absolutely no evidence of a link between Prozac and suicide but, within academic circles, Healy, who is director of the North Wales department of psychological medicine, has a high reputation. Two years ago, he began to be courted by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) at Toronto University. He spent three days there in July 1999. Afterwards, Paul Garfinkel, the chair of the department, wrote an appreciative letter, anticipating the chance to \"discuss more specifically the arrangements for you in Toronto\" and talking of meeting Healy's wife so that \"she too might look forward to a good opportunity in Canada\". </p> <p>On January 28 last year, Sidney Kennedy, another professor in the department, wrote with full details of the position Healy was being offered, including rank and salary. In August, the formal offer was made by David Goldbloom, physician in chief at CAMH - and Healy formally accepted it in September. Only the immigration hurdles remained. </p> <p>Then in November, Healy was invited to speak at a two-day conference at CAMH. Everything seemed to be going smoothly. The day before, he received a handwritten note from Goldbloom, giving him the names of colleagues who could advise him on schools for his children. He was urged by the professor to give one month's notice to his employer in the UK instead of three. He was told: \"We need to get you here within weeks rather than months.\" </p> <p>The talk on November 30 appeared to go down well - the same talk received acclaim in the US a few days later and again earlier this year in Paris. But in Toronto, Goldbloom showed signs of distress. At a dinner that night, Healy said in a subsequent letter to the ethics committee of Toronto University's board of trustees, \"he was too livid to engage in any constructive dialogue\". According to Healy, Goldbloom was worried that the main thing people would take away from his talk was the claim that Prozac can cause suicide. </p> <p>Within a few days, Healy received an email from Goldbloom, saying he had something urgent to discuss. Healy's travel schedule made a telephone conversation impossible, so Goldbloom finally broke the news by email on December 7. \"Essentially, we believe that it is not a good fit between you and the role as leader of an academic program in mood and anxiety disorders at the centre and in relation to the university,\" he said. \"This view was solidified by your recent appearance at the centre in the context of an academic lecture. While you are held in high regard as a scholar of the history of modern psychiatry, we do not feel your approach is compatible with the goals for development of the academic and clinical resource that we have.\" </p> <p>The decision to rescind Healy's job offer, apparently within hours of a talk on the dangers of Prozac, has caused uproar in Canadian academic circles because CAMH is generously funded by Prozac manufacturers Eli Lilly to the tune of more than $1.5m in recent years. To the Canadian Association of University Teachers, what has happened to Healy is \"an affront to academic freedom in Canada\". </p> <p>It has hit a nerve that is already raw. Last year an international furore broke out over Nancy Olivieri, the Toronto-based scientist who broke a confidentiality agreement with the pharmaceutical company Apotex and published research concerning the level of toxicity of its drug Deferiprone for children suffering from thalassaemia. The Hospital for Sick Children, part of Toronto University, at one point tried to sack her. James Turk, executive director of the Association, draws a parallel with the treatment of Healy. \"This is every bit as serious as the Olivieri case - and that's a very serious one,\" he says. \"We can't see how this can be other than a serious erosion of academic freedom.\" </p> <p>Turk says that the wording of Goldbloom's email is telling. \"Development is a euphemism here for fundraising. I read that as meaning your appointment will make it more difficult to raise the money that we need to pursue our programmes.\" </p> <p>The crucial question is what - or who - persuaded CAMH to change its mind so suddenly. Healy's views are well known. But what Goldbloom and his colleagues may not have appreciated - until someone told them - was the significance of employing an academic with such views in a world where research is heavily reliant on drug-company grants. </p> <p>That someone, says Healy, may have been Charles Nemeroff, a professor of psycho-pharmacology at Emory University in Atlanta who has strong links, including shareholdings, to Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, the three companies that make SSRIs which are, or have been, involved in court cases where Healy has been an expert witness. </p> <p>Predictably, rumours about his alliances, or lack of them, abound. It is safe to say that his views are expressed in a forceful manner - he is a passionate person - and he fully expects to lead the corporate strategy of those he advises.\" </p> <p>Nemeroff was at the Toronto meeting, giving a talk of his own, but he did not stay for the second day. Instead, he went to another psychiatric gathering in New York where, says Healy: \"My understanding is that he was saying I had lost my job.\" That was a week before Healy knew it himself. </p> <p>Nemeroff has made no secret of his hostility to Healy's work. In July last year, at the British Association for Psychopharmacology, Healy says that Nemeroff sought him out to berate him over a study he had carried out of the effects of one of the SSRIs on healthy volunteers - people with no history of depression or other mental illness. Two out of 20 became suicidal. </p> <p>\"He began, as far as I can remember, by stating that I had no right publishing material like that,\" says Healy. \"I mentioned that it was all good, clear-cut science and that there were other findings in the literature which backed this up. He said it would be bad for my career to get involved in all this - that in the course of the previous few weeks he had been approached on five occasions to see whether he would testify in legal actions against me. I initially interpreted this, as did another witness at the scene, to mean that some companies were planning to take a specific action of some sort against me.\" </p> <p>Later in the conversation, Healy says he suggested it was their duty as doctors to warn of the side-effects of drugs, to make them as safe as possible. \"Charlie suggested it was immaterial what people like him or me did. [The companies] were answerable to their shareholders and profit was the bottom line.\" </p> <p>Nemeroff's office refers press calls to Nina M Gussack, a Philadelphia lawyer, who has defended Eli Lilly in Prozac litigation. She denies that he orchestrated the loss of Healy's job, but she says that university officials did ask his opinion of Healy's science. </p> <p>Nemeroff, she says, \"finds himself to be at the very opposite end of the spectrum\" from Healy on the issue of Prozac and suicide. </p> <p>The University of Toronto denies that the Prozac issue was connected with the change of heart over Healy. Asked what \"not a good fit\" meant, Garfinkel says: \"It means that the search committee had in its internal deliberations reasons to feel that there were going to be better opportunities for our mood programme.\" He implies that the decision had been taken over a period of some time. \"I don't think there was one event that made people decide,\" he says. </p> <p>But Healy points out that the attitude of everybody at Toronto towards him was very positive until the talk, and that the day before he spoke he was even asked to sit on an interview panel for a post that would be under his supervision when he moved to Canada. </p> <p>Eli Lilly denies having exerted any influence. \"Lilly was not involved in any decision to withdraw the job offer to Dr Healy as Lilly does not get involved in employment matters of its grant recipients,\" it says in a statement. Any suggestion that what happened would have a bearing on future court cases \"would be purely speculation and we don't comment on speculation\". </p> <p>However, Andy Vickery, of Vickery and Waldner, a law firm based in Houston, Texas, which has retained Healy as an expert witness in a number of SSRI cases, says he has no doubt that what happened to Healy was connected with the litigation. \"It is either to try to keep him out or to punish him for having the audacity to speak up on behalf of families.\" </p> <p>Healy, he says, is a problem for those who want to \"perpetuate the myth that there's no problem with these drugs\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "The row over racism which led to William Hague disciplining two rebel backbenchers last week is unlikely to go away in the heated atmosphere of the next few weeks. Disturbing new economic research suggests that many people share the views of the two silenced MPs. Mr Hague made John Townend apologise for comments about immigration turning Britain into a mongrel race, while Laurence Robertson was forced to retract his warnings about the dangers of \"cramming\" in different ethnic groups. Some senior Tories blame the commission for racial equality and the government for suppressing a legitimate debate about immigration and asylum under the guise of banning racist or inflammatory electioneering. Unfortunately, it appears the public opposition towards further immigration, either legal or illegal is driven largely by racism rather than fears the new arrivals will take jobs away from locals or be a burden on the welfare system. Using several waves of the British Social Attitudes survey, researchers Christian Dustmann and Ian Preston find that two-thirds of the public are opposed to further immigration by ethnic minorities, and their hostility associated with racist views about ethnic minorities. More than 66% of those questioned in the BSA survey would prefer fewer immigrants from the West Indies and more than 70% would prefer fewer immigrants from Asia. The BSA also asks respondents about whether they consider inter-ethnic marriage acceptable, what they would think about having a boss from an ethnic minority and if they consider themselves to be prejudiced. It also asks if they worried about losing their jobs or about the strains on the welfare system. Dustmann and Preston find that opposition to further immigration is heavily correlated to racist attitudes as revealed by the BSA questions about ethnic minorities. Worries about immigrants taking jobs or welfare benefits are a less important factor. The fact that only a minority oppose immigration from ethnically similar countries such as Australia and New Zealand is further proof of entrenched public hostility towards people of Asian or Afro-Caribbean origin. The research uses data from large-scale surveys to show that people who are most hostile towards immigrants hold strongly racist views. \"Racial prejudice is by far the most important, explaining negative inclinations towards immigration of ethnically different populations,\" the researchers say. Low-skilled workers, who might be thought to worry about competition for jobs, are in fact more likely than more highly skilled workers to be hostile to immigrants because of racist views, according to the report. The research demonstrates why hardline anti-immigration speeches by politicians play well with the public. As the CRE suspects, whatever excuses are made about discussing issues like jobs and welfare spending, the debate is really about race. Dustmann and Preston argue that European countries are going to have to change their hardline on immigration because they are running out of workers. To keep its working population stable between now 2050, the European Union needs to import 1.4m immigrants a year.

The British government has recognised the need for immigration to attract skilled workers in some sectors and has changed work permit rules to allow in a limited number of immigrants. But there are few signs that the government is preparing to try to turn around the large scale public hostility to immigrants revealed by the survey data. Some commentators argue that by taking a hardline stance on asylum seekers, Labour is secretly exploiting the same racist attitudes it accuses the opposition of fomenting.

      "bodyText": "A pastoral letter praising racial diversity and the \"overwhelming desire of local people to live peaceably and justly\" was read yesterday in every Anglican church in Oldham, after a tense stand-off between police and rival groups. The Bishop of Middleton, Michael Lewis, issued the strongly worded letter following claims of racial no-go areas in the town which attracted outside demonstrators from the National Front and a counter-protest from the Anti-Nazi League at the weekend. Sporadic fighting broke out on Saturday evening as an overwhelming show of strength by Greater Manchester police wound down, and 16 people were arrested for alleged public order offences. Only some 30 rightwingers mustered in defiance of a three-month ban on demonstrations in Oldham, and they spent most of the day penned into a garage forecourt by police. But an angry reaction from some Asian youths led to scuffles, window-smashing and three home-made petrol bombs being thrown. A police spokesman said that \"some racially motivated damage had been done to houses\" and that detectives were investigating the stabbing of a white man in the Hathershaw area. The bishop said in his letter that recent violence in Oldham had been disturbing but did not justify the picture painted in some quarters of outright hostility between racial groups. He stressed the desire of local communities to live peaceably. He praised Oldham Muslims for promoting \"peace and neighbourliness\" and concluded: \"Racial diversity is a cause for celebration rather than fear.\" Police in Bradford, meanwhile, are hunting two racist gangs after four men were treated for concussion and bruising from unprovoked attacks. Two Asian youths were set upon by up to 30 Middlesbrough football supporters outside Bradford City's ground at Valley Parade, and two white brothers, aged 28 and 26, were kicked and beated by up to 12 Asian men in the city centre.",

Crowther's brilliant touchline conversion gave Hull a 10-point cushion. This was always a bad-tempered game, despite the attractive veneer, and it erupted five minutes later. As the Hull substitute Paul King's decisive drop goal sailed over, London's Justin Dooley was assaulting Steve Prescott. Dooley was lucky only to be sin-binned, Prescott just as unlucky to join him. A fiery final quarter was made all the more frantic by a late Broncos try from Michael Gillett. \"We just needed an ounce of luck,\" said his coach Tony Rae. Rae's opposite number, Shaun McRae, was happier. \"There are more than just a top four clubs now,\" he beamed. \"And that's good for the game.\" Hull : Prescott; Raynor, Horne, Bird, Crowther; Cooke, T Smith; Broadbent, Jackson, Craven, Felsch, Grimaldi, J Smith. Substitutes : Campbell, Fletcher, King, Carvell. London Broncos: Barnett; Warton, Martin, Roy, Golden; Tollett, Moran; Mestrov, Hetherington, Cram, Toshack, Retchless, Dymock. Substitutes : Millard, Gillett, Dooley, Clarke. Referee: S Ganson (St Helens).",

The Wasps director of rugby Nigel Melville later insisted Dallaglio's injury was \"nothing serious\" but confirmed two further Lions, Rob Henderson (knee) and Phil Greening (ribs) had also been withdrawn for their protection. </p> <p>Melville chose to blame a loss of composure for his side's collapse after a first half in which they could have put 40 points on the board instead of a mere 24. </p> <p>Callard preferred to praise his young team's sense of adventure but Wasps did have two touchdowns ruled out for fractional forward passes, the first by Dallaglio to Shane Roiser in the second minute appearing legal to almost everyone in the ground bar the touch judge Robin Goodliffe. </p> <p>For a while it seemed unlikely to matter.

One minute Alex King was bearing down on the Bath line with Perry and Iain Balshaw scrambling desperately to gather a loose ball, the next Balshaw had instigated a raid deep into the Wasps' half only for Voyce to fumble a loose pass from his fly-half Gareth Cooper and allow Wasps to hack the ball upfield and score themselves. </p> <p>Voyce soon redeemed himself with a breakway score after Paul Volley's pass had gone to ground and Bath were back to 24-21 two minutes after half-time when Henderson tugged back Steve Borthwick and the referee Brian Campsall correctly awarded a penalty try.</p> <p>The Irish Lion in waiting also coughed up the turnover which allowed Balshaw to score another superb counter-attacking gem.

      "body": "<p>Now their place in the final of the Zurich Championship is assured, it's time to ask if Leicester can win the treble of the Premiership, Championship and Heineken Cup? I'm not sure. I feel they will win the play-off final, but the European Cup final may be a different matter. </p> <p>They are probably the most consistent team in Europe, but a one-off game against Stade Fran\u00e7ais in Paris could be hard for them. I'd give them a 50-50 chance in what is bound to be their biggest challenge of the year. </p> <p>Whether or not they do become European champions, I think they are the best team of the last 10 years in England - the rugby equivalent of Manchester United. They set a standard of their own: they have lost only two league games this season, which is just incredible. </p> <p>The biggest thing they have going for them is that Leicester is a city which lives for rugby. It's the most important thing up there, and that means lots of tradition and local support, which in turn means they can fill a big stadium every week. It's a good financial foundation. </p> <p>On the pitch, they have a good mix of players, both young and experienced. And in Martin Johnson they have a big captain - in every sense - even if sometimes he loses his head.

      "bodyText": "Now their place in the final of the Zurich Championship is assured, it's time to ask if Leicester can win the treble of the Premiership, Championship and Heineken Cup? I'm not sure. I feel they will win the play-off final, but the European Cup final may be a different matter. They are probably the most consistent team in Europe, but a one-off game against Stade Fran\u00e7ais in Paris could be hard for them. I'd give them a 50-50 chance in what is bound to be their biggest challenge of the year. Whether or not they do become European champions, I think they are the best team of the last 10 years in England - the rugby equivalent of Manchester United. They set a standard of their own: they have lost only two league games this season, which is just incredible. The biggest thing they have going for them is that Leicester is a city which lives for rugby. It's the most important thing up there, and that means lots of tradition and local support, which in turn means they can fill a big stadium every week. It's a good financial foundation. On the pitch, they have a good mix of players, both young and experienced. And in Martin Johnson they have a big captain - in every sense - even if sometimes he loses his head. He's a hard man, very charismatic. Even so, I think Pat Howard has been their best player this year, and perhaps the best in the league. One of the most important things for Leicester this season has been the fact that he hasn't had any injuries and hasn't missed many games.

Olazabal has been campaigning across the Atlantic, where the best of his eight finishes so far is a tie for 12th in the Players Championship, and missed the cut on his first European outing of the season in last month's Spanish Open.

Increasingly Williams stepped forward to finish rallies off from mid-court with swinging drive volleys which made the ochre dust look anything but slow and the opposition anything but respectable. </p> <p>\"I am a little bit upset: I felt a bit hopeless today,\" admitted Shaughnessy, who has just climbed into the world's top 20. \"Even if I had played really well I don't know how long I could have held her up.\" </p> <p>In fact the WTA Tour event final lasted only 54 minutes and there were only about 20 of those when the outcome was in doubt. Shaughnessy risked a hit-or-bust policy to break back for 2-2 but immediately lost her service again and, by dropping serve for a third time at the start of the second set, trying to do too much and double-faulting on break point, she allowed herself to run into the eye of a storm. </p> <p>That was because it gave the world No2 a cushion to have a whirl at almost anything and when she did it usually came off. Whether Williams can prevail against the best clay-courters on the biggest occasion is unproven, but she talks as if she can. </p> <p>\"I dreamed about winning Roland Garros. I dreamed about it a little bit more than my dream of winning Wimbledon,\" she claimed. \"And I think I have as good a chance as I do on hard or on grass.\" </p> <p>Not everyone agrees. However, Williams completed the week by conceding a mere 12 games in eight sets, and 10 of the last 14 Hamburg finals have produced at least one of the Paris finalists. The crux may be whether she has the hang of sliding into the shot on the loose top without undue stress to the knee which caused the furore in Miami when she withdrew. </p> <p>This week in Berlin, Martina Hingis should provide tougher opposition. If Williams wins again, she will be within striking distance of another big goal - only a couple of hundred ranking points behind the world No1.</p>",

Increasingly Williams stepped forward to finish rallies off from mid-court with swinging drive volleys which made the ochre dust look anything but slow and the opposition anything but respectable. \"I am a little bit upset: I felt a bit hopeless today,\" admitted Shaughnessy, who has just climbed into the world's top 20. \"Even if I had played really well I don't know how long I could have held her up.\" In fact the WTA Tour event final lasted only 54 minutes and there were only about 20 of those when the outcome was in doubt. Shaughnessy risked a hit-or-bust policy to break back for 2-2 but immediately lost her service again and, by dropping serve for a third time at the start of the second set, trying to do too much and double-faulting on break point, she allowed herself to run into the eye of a storm. That was because it gave the world No2 a cushion to have a whirl at almost anything and when she did it usually came off. Whether Williams can prevail against the best clay-courters on the biggest occasion is unproven, but she talks as if she can. \"I dreamed about winning Roland Garros. I dreamed about it a little bit more than my dream of winning Wimbledon,\" she claimed. \"And I think I have as good a chance as I do on hard or on grass.\" Not everyone agrees. However, Williams completed the week by conceding a mere 12 games in eight sets, and 10 of the last 14 Hamburg finals have produced at least one of the Paris finalists. The crux may be whether she has the hang of sliding into the shot on the loose top without undue stress to the knee which caused the furore in Miami when she withdrew. This week in Berlin, Martina Hingis should provide tougher opposition. If Williams wins again, she will be within striking distance of another big goal - only a couple of hundred ranking points behind the world No1.",

He was immediately rearrested and appeared at a west London magistrates court three and a half hours after the plane landed.</p> <p>After a brief hearing, Biggs, 71, was sent back to jail to serve his time at Belmarsh prison in south east London. Biggs immediately vowed to appeal. A statement issued through his lawyer said he would seek a hearing before the Court of Appeals to have his original sentence overturned.</p> <p>At today's hearing, Biggs was not charged with any offence, District Judge Tim Workman merely having to be satisfied that he was the person named in an arrest warrant issued following his prison break in 1965.</p> <p>About 60 police officers were awaiting his arrival at the entrance to RAF Northolt in northeast London this morning. Seven police vans and at least three police cars welcomed the frail and penniless Biggs, who has suffered three strokes and can no longer speak properly.</p> <p>Biggs left Rio de Janeiro, his home for most of his time on the run, last night amid chaotic scenes as reporters and photographers sought to get a glimpse of one of the world's most famous fugitives.</p> <p>Biggs, who long ago spent his \u00a3147,000 share (worth about \u00a31.6m in today's money) of the 1963 mail train robbery haul, hopes to receive vital medical treatment, which he could not afford in Brazil. The fugitive, who escaped from Wandsworth prison in 1965 after serving 15 months of his 30 year sentence for robbery, returned to Britain in a Dassault Falcon 900 executive jet stocked with curry, Marmite and cans of beer.</p> <p>Biggs has 28 years of a 30-year prison sentence still to serve for his role in the 1963 robbery of the Glasgow-to-London mail train, which yielded \u00a32.6m.</p> <p>At Northolt, waiting press were kept outside a perimeter fence and RAF police patrolled with dogs.</p> <p>Biggs, who said his last wish was to walk into a Margate pub and buy a pint of bitter, has been issued with an emergency passport which allows him to make a single, one-way trip back to Britain.</p> <p>Family friend Kevin Crace said Biggs was \"very excited\" about the prospect of coming back to Britain.</p> <p>He said he had spoken to the train robber's son Michael, 26, in Brazil who had told him that \"the old Biggs sparkle had appeared in his eye\".</p> <p>The train robber's return from exile has sparked a row over what should happen to him.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, called for a \"hard-headed\" attitude, saying he should spend the rest of his life behind bars.</p> <p>But friends said the authorities should treat him with compassion as he was in poor health after his third stroke. Unable to speak, Biggs now communicates through written notes.</p> <p>Last week Biggs sent an email to the head of the Flying Squad, Detective Chief Superintendent John Coles, the officer in overall charge of the Met's Serious and Organised Crime Group, saying he wanted to give himself up. Biggs is hoping, because of his health, that he will be put in a jail hospital while the authorities decide what to do with him. There have been suggestions that he has run out of money and wants to return home to get free medical treatment on the NHS.</p> <p>But the home secretary, Jack Straw, said any individual unlawfully at large from prison was liable to immediate rearrest and return to prison as soon as it came to the notice of the police.</p> <p>In Brazil Biggs made money by inviting people into his home and selling T-shirts and souvenirs on his own website.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,487083,00.html\">Farcical scenes at airport as Biggs heads home</a><br><a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,485487,00.html\">03.05.2001: Da doo Ron Ron Ron, da doo Ron Ron...</a> <br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,482380,00.html \">03.05.2001: How Biggs eluded justice for 35 years</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3951294,00.html\">16.01.2000: Sick Biggs: let me come home</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3890933,00.html\">09.08.1999: Rogues' gallery salutes Biggs at 70</a> <br> <b>Timeline</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/dome/article/0,2763,394084,00.html\">Britain's biggest robberies</a> <br> <b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee8296d/0\">Should Ronnie Biggs serve his time?</a> <br> <b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,485296,00.html\">The Ronnie Biggs story in pictures</a> <br> <b>Useful link</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.ronniebiggs.com/\" target=\"_new\">RonnieBiggs.com</a></p>",

About 60 police officers were awaiting his arrival at the entrance to RAF Northolt in northeast London this morning. Seven police vans and at least three police cars welcomed the frail and penniless Biggs, who has suffered three strokes and can no longer speak properly. Biggs left Rio de Janeiro, his home for most of his time on the run, last night amid chaotic scenes as reporters and photographers sought to get a glimpse of one of the world's most famous fugitives. Biggs, who long ago spent his \u00a3147,000 share (worth about \u00a31.6m in today's money) of the 1963 mail train robbery haul, hopes to receive vital medical treatment, which he could not afford in Brazil. The fugitive, who escaped from Wandsworth prison in 1965 after serving 15 months of his 30 year sentence for robbery, returned to Britain in a Dassault Falcon 900 executive jet stocked with curry, Marmite and cans of beer. Biggs has 28 years of a 30-year prison sentence still to serve for his role in the 1963 robbery of the Glasgow-to-London mail train, which yielded \u00a32.6m. At Northolt, waiting press were kept outside a perimeter fence and RAF police patrolled with dogs. Biggs, who said his last wish was to walk into a Margate pub and buy a pint of bitter, has been issued with an emergency passport which allows him to make a single, one-way trip back to Britain. Family friend Kevin Crace said Biggs was \"very excited\" about the prospect of coming back to Britain. He said he had spoken to the train robber's son Michael, 26, in Brazil who had told him that \"the old Biggs sparkle had appeared in his eye\". The train robber's return from exile has sparked a row over what should happen to him. The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, called for a \"hard-headed\" attitude, saying he should spend the rest of his life behind bars. But friends said the authorities should treat him with compassion as he was in poor health after his third stroke. Unable to speak, Biggs now communicates through written notes. Last week Biggs sent an email to the head of the Flying Squad, Detective Chief Superintendent John Coles, the officer in overall charge of the Met's Serious and Organised Crime Group, saying he wanted to give himself up. Biggs is hoping, because of his health, that he will be put in a jail hospital while the authorities decide what to do with him. There have been suggestions that he has run out of money and wants to return home to get free medical treatment on the NHS. But the home secretary, Jack Straw, said any individual unlawfully at large from prison was liable to immediate rearrest and return to prison as soon as it came to the notice of the police. In Brazil Biggs made money by inviting people into his home and selling T-shirts and souvenirs on his own website.

Don't call us, Chris; we'll call you. </p> <p>A sportsman's life is a brief and, for the lucky, glorious one. By the time a footballer reaches his late 20s he is approaching his sell-by date and on the reduced counter. At thirtysomething he is in the \"everything must go\" league.

If they cannot pass on their experience and expertise in a coaching position and Radio 5 Live will not have them - and they have Peter Beardsley after all - they have to be thinking a sports shop somewhere in the home counties, a pub in Essex or, I suppose, catering in Cornwall. </p> <p>Chris Old's life had a trajectory most professional sportsmen would recognise. The first half of his life was gilded. He was naturally gifted. As a boy he excelled at both cricket and rugby and in his teens had to decide which he was going to specialise in.

Cold: yes. Tea: yes. A smug satisfaction at spending the day outside rather than loafing around watching Dawson's Creek: most definitely. They do not dare to fantasise about the tingle factor. </p> <p>So the crowd here fell on their feet, albeit frozen ones. They came, they saw and they were treated to 142 minutes of unbuckled exhilaration and swagger from Owais Shah. He made an unbeaten 118 with nine fours and three sixes - including one huge sweep to take him to 99 - and powered Middlesex to an easy victory. </p> <p>It was an innings that shone all the more because over the past year or so Shah has been pigeon-holed as an idle waster - talented but too cocky, all the strokes but don't-give-a-damn careless. It was quite a haul for a player who had been f ted almost since he picked up a bat. He made his county debut in 1995 aged 16 and led England to victory in the under-19 World Cup in 1997-98. </p> <p>And in the late summer of 1999 he scored three centuries for Middlesex in just over a month. But since then there has been almost nothing.

      "bodyText": "Middlesex 225-5 Hampshire 200-8 Middlesex won by 25 runs Those who choose to spend a bitter Sunday watching B&amp;H south division zonal matches pretty much know what they are going to get. Cold: yes. Tea: yes. A smug satisfaction at spending the day outside rather than loafing around watching Dawson's Creek: most definitely. They do not dare to fantasise about the tingle factor. So the crowd here fell on their feet, albeit frozen ones. They came, they saw and they were treated to 142 minutes of unbuckled exhilaration and swagger from Owais Shah. He made an unbeaten 118 with nine fours and three sixes - including one huge sweep to take him to 99 - and powered Middlesex to an easy victory. It was an innings that shone all the more because over the past year or so Shah has been pigeon-holed as an idle waster - talented but too cocky, all the strokes but don't-give-a-damn careless. It was quite a haul for a player who had been f ted almost since he picked up a bat. He made his county debut in 1995 aged 16 and led England to victory in the under-19 World Cup in 1997-98. And in the late summer of 1999 he scored three centuries for Middlesex in just over a month. But since then there has been almost nothing. He averaged 24 in the championship last year, scored only three 50s in any cricket and by mid-July was dropped. This innings showed what Middlesex have been missing. Shah does not look particularly gainly; he sticks his bottom out so far that his 6ft 1in frame seems squatter than it is and his feet sometimes look to be one step ahead of his brain. But the speed of his bat through the air and his immaculate timing make every stroke look effortless.

His loss may also prove to be a substantial blow to Lancashire's championship hopes. </p> <p>Flintoff should have been celebrating when he had Darren Lehmann, Yorkshire's Australian linchpin, caught at backward point to give his team a glimmer of hope in this North Division match. But as Bob Simpson, the Lancashire coach, explained, the 23-year-old, who remodelled his bowling action during the winter to ease the strain on his troublesome back, already had an inkling that his injury curse had struck again. </p> <p>\"He felt it with the ball that got Lehmann,\" said Simpson. \"He's done a muscle and at this stage he will probably be out at least two weeks.\" England play Pakistan in the first game of the NatWest series on June 7. </p> <p>Flintoff was always an outsider to take the vacant seventh batting place in England's team for the first Test against Pakistan at Lord's on Thursday week, especially as he has struggled so far this season, failing again yesterday. But he remained a regular in England's one-day team in Sri Lanka and Pakistan last winter even though his back problems prevented him from bowling. </p> <p>With Flintoff back in the pavilion, Michael Lumb steered Yorkshire to victory with more than three overs to spare, maintaining their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals. Another win today against Durham at Headingley in the last round of group matches will probably be enough. </p> <p>Lehmann took his second Gold Award of the week, as much for figures of 6-1-13-1, including the crucial wicket of John Crawley, as his typically belligerent 35 which included two fours and a straight six off Muttiah Muralitharan. </p> <p>David Byas, who has suffered more than prospered in one-day games against Lancashire in his six years as Yorkshire's captain, also played a substantial part in this satisfying victory, steering his team to 135 for two in the 36th over with 55 from 107 balls until he was bowled by Joe Scuderi. </p> <p>Lancashire's innings had illustrated how much they rely on Neil Fairbrother, who was again missing because of a hamstring injury. Crawley and Michael Atherton had established an excellent platform with a second-wicket stand of 110 in 30 overs, the England opener gliding to his second consecutive half-century from 81 balls with five boundaries out of the textbook. </p> <p>But after he had fallen in unorthodox fashion, top-edging a waist-high full toss from Gary Fellows to Lehmann at long leg, Lancashire lost wickets regularly, and momentum completely. Crawley, who had reached a 90-ball 50 as he battles for early-season form, was bowled trying to cut Lehmann's arm ball in the next over, and Flintoff scratched around for 10 overs without hitting a boundary before lofting the first ball of Ryan Sidebottom's second spell to long off. </p> <p>Sidebottom had already combined with Craig White, who bowled his 10 overs straight through and tidily enough, to put the squeeze on Atherton and Crawley, and rivalled Lehmann as the pick of the Yorkshire attack. But Chris Silverwood claimed the best figures, adding two late wickets to his early dismissal of Chilton to end with three for 30. </p> <p>Darren Gough, who like White was making his first appearance of the season, eased back with one for 33 from nine uneventful overs. \"Once again our batting has let us down,\" lamented Simpson. \"At two for 120 you should be looking at a comfortable 220.\"</p>",

But as Bob Simpson, the Lancashire coach, explained, the 23-year-old, who remodelled his bowling action during the winter to ease the strain on his troublesome back, already had an inkling that his injury curse had struck again. \"He felt it with the ball that got Lehmann,\" said Simpson. \"He's done a muscle and at this stage he will probably be out at least two weeks.\" England play Pakistan in the first game of the NatWest series on June 7. Flintoff was always an outsider to take the vacant seventh batting place in England's team for the first Test against Pakistan at Lord's on Thursday week, especially as he has struggled so far this season, failing again yesterday. But he remained a regular in England's one-day team in Sri Lanka and Pakistan last winter even though his back problems prevented him from bowling. With Flintoff back in the pavilion, Michael Lumb steered Yorkshire to victory with more than three overs to spare, maintaining their hopes of reaching the quarter-finals. Another win today against Durham at Headingley in the last round of group matches will probably be enough. Lehmann took his second Gold Award of the week, as much for figures of 6-1-13-1, including the crucial wicket of John Crawley, as his typically belligerent 35 which included two fours and a straight six off Muttiah Muralitharan. David Byas, who has suffered more than prospered in one-day games against Lancashire in his six years as Yorkshire's captain, also played a substantial part in this satisfying victory, steering his team to 135 for two in the 36th over with 55 from 107 balls until he was bowled by Joe Scuderi. Lancashire's innings had illustrated how much they rely on Neil Fairbrother, who was again missing because of a hamstring injury. Crawley and Michael Atherton had established an excellent platform with a second-wicket stand of 110 in 30 overs, the England opener gliding to his second consecutive half-century from 81 balls with five boundaries out of the textbook. But after he had fallen in unorthodox fashion, top-edging a waist-high full toss from Gary Fellows to Lehmann at long leg, Lancashire lost wickets regularly, and momentum completely. Crawley, who had reached a 90-ball 50 as he battles for early-season form, was bowled trying to cut Lehmann's arm ball in the next over, and Flintoff scratched around for 10 overs without hitting a boundary before lofting the first ball of Ryan Sidebottom's second spell to long off. Sidebottom had already combined with Craig White, who bowled his 10 overs straight through and tidily enough, to put the squeeze on Atherton and Crawley, and rivalled Lehmann as the pick of the Yorkshire attack. But Chris Silverwood claimed the best figures, adding two late wickets to his early dismissal of Chilton to end with three for 30. Darren Gough, who like White was making his first appearance of the season, eased back with one for 33 from nine uneventful overs. \"Once again our batting has let us down,\" lamented Simpson. \"At two for 120 you should be looking at a comfortable 220.\"",

Palestinian doctors said 10 children were among the injured. The Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, expressed regret, saying that Israeli troops did not intend to harm children. In a speech to parliament after the attack, Mr Sharon accused the Palestinian Authority of active involvement in attacks on Israelis and weapons smuggling and said he would not resume peace talks under fire. In the West Bank, Israeli troops briefly entered two Palestinian towns in pursuit of gunmen - part of a new policy that gives field commanders the authority to decide on such forays on the spot, without waiting for government approval. The Palestinians consider such forays a major violation of interim peace accords. The United States has sharply criticised the incursions. Today's fighting began when Palestinians fired four mortar shells at two Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, without causing injuries. In response, Israeli tanks shelled buildings in the Khan Yunis refugee camp and troops fired large calibre machine guns. One shell hit the shack of the Hijo family in the camp, instantly killing four-month-old Iman Hijo, with shrapnel tearing an orange-sized hole into the infant's back. The girl's 19-year-old mother and three other children belonging to the extended family were wounded. One of the children,18-month-old Mahmoud, was in intensive care at Nasser hospital with extensive shrapnel wounds, doctors said.

Monday's deaths brought to 436 the number of Palestinians killed since the latest wave of violence began in late September. Seventy-two Israelis have been killed. Amid the latest fighting, Israeli and Palestinian officials gave mixed reviews of the US-led Mitchell Commission, which issued its draft findings on the causes of the violence. Israeli cabinet minister Danny Naveh said the report's call for a halt to construction at Jewish settlements conflicted with peace accords that state the fate of the communities will be worked out in a final agreement. Palestinian information minister Yasser Abed Rabbo said the Palestinians \"accept the findings... in as much as they point directly to Israel's continued occupation of Palestinian land.\" But the report did not support the Palestinian call for an international force, which Abed Rabbo described as one of several \"oversights.\" Related articles 07.05.2001: Pope makes history in Syria, and angers Israel 07.05.2001: Israeli raid crosses line drawn by Oslo pact 07.05.2001: 'I came here to write about peace' Useful links Palestinian national authority Office of the Israeli prime minister Jerusalem Post Palestine Times Arabic internet network Ha'aretz",

A US defence official confirmed that the RC-135 reconnaissance plane, flying from Kadena air base on the Japanese island of Okinawa, flew a routine track along the northern portion of China's coastline. The unarmed plane, which is used routinely for surveillance flights off China's coast, drew no response from the Chinese military and returned safely to base, the official said. The Bush administration has previously stated its commitment to resuming surveillance flights off China's coast, but today's flight was the first since last month's incident over the South China sea. The pilot of the Chinese jet was lost in the collision and the 24 crew members of the EP-3E were held by on Hainan for 11 days. The US plane was badly damaged in the incident and officials say the Chinese likely harvested valuable intelligence from the craft, although the crew apparently managed to destroy the most sensitive information. Defence secretary Donald H Rumsfeld yesterday said that he believed China would allow the United States to get the EP-3E back, and he said it appeared that the plane could be repaired sufficiently on Hainan to fly it out. \"We'll know later this week,\" he told NBC.

The package is the outcome a year-long review of sentencing policy. It will sound the death knell of the liberal philosophy behind the 1991 criminal justice act of making the \"punishment fit the crime\" and which was introduced to keep down prison numbers.

The home secretary calls this \"stay straight or go back to prison\". \u0095 New powers for the courts to make offenders sentenced to community punishments such as probation to come back to court at specified intervals to report on their progress. For example, a drug offender might be ordered to stay off drugs. If he failed to provide evidence of negative drug test results the court might impose a more severe sentence. The precise impact of these anti-crime measures will be revealed tomorrow but unless they are combined with shorter sentences it can be expected that numbers sent to prison will rise sharply under a second-term Labour government.",

Setting out his party's local government manifesto, Mr Hague accused Labour of masterminding a 31% increase in \"stealth\" council taxes and of using local government as a tool to push through a central government agenda rather than taking the views of local people into account. Mr Hague said: \"It makes no difference where Labour is given the chance to govern, the story is the same: higher taxes for those who can least afford them and poorer services for those who need them.\" He promised to give parents and teachers greater control of schools, local councils greater powers to evict \"neighbours from hell\" and local communities lower council tax burdens. He said that within weeks of taking office, the Conservatives would abolish Labour's centrally planned homebuilding agenda, giving local people the power to decide how many new homes should be built and where they should be put. The Conservatives also pledged to introduce doorstep recycling for all households, to renovate rundown council housing and to give councils new resources to remove litter, graffiti and abandoned cars. Mr Hague, who knows he will be facing a general election announcement within days, took the opportunity to point out Conservative successes in recent local elections.

      "bodyText": "Using artillery and tanks, Macedonian military and police forces restarted their offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels this morning, prompting fears among international officials that Macedonia is descending into the next Balkan conflict. A Macedonian military spokesman said today that the army is engaged in \"clean and sweep operations\" near the northern city of Kumanovo. Late yesterday, Albanian insurgents opened fire on a Macedonian army patrol in the nearby village of Lojane. The army returned fire and \"neutralised\" the rebels, said the spokesman. He couldn't say whether there had been casualties among the Albanians. No government soldiers were injured in the attack. The new fighting underlined the government's increasingly tenuous control of areas near the border with the southern Yugoslav province of Kosovo. European Union officials have urged Macedonia not to declare a state of war, sending their top diplomatic envoy to push for an end to the fighting. Javier Solana, the EU's security affairs chief, was to ask the Macedonian prime minister, Ljbuco Georgievski, to work harder at creating peace with ethnic Albanian rebels, who insist they are denied equal rights under the country's constitution. Yesterday, Macedonian forces lobbed shells into villages seized by rebels north-east of the capital, Skopje, pounding militant strongholds just hours after the expiration of a deadline set for civilians to evacuate. The government claimed the rebels were holding hundreds of civilians as human shields. A delegation from the International Committee of the Red Cross visited the villages of Vaksince and Slupcane yesterday to assess the conditions of civilians there, spokeswoman Annick Bouvier said today. About 2,000 civilians, including women and children, have been huddled in basements for four days. \"The situation is very confusing,\" she said. \"We could feel a sense of solidarity. They don't want to be excluded from their relatives. But we can't exclude the possibility that they're being held against their will.\" The organisation evacuated 13 people, including two pregnant women and two children, Ms Bouvier said. The push by Macedonian forces on the ground follows a pledge by Macedonia's prime minister to pressure parliament to declare a state of war - a move designed to give the government a freer hand in attacks against militants hunkered down near the border with Kosovo. \"The integrity of our country is threatened,\" government spokesman Antonio Milososki said at a news conference yesterday, only a few miles from the site of recent attacks. Bolstering his claims, rebels opened fire on soldiers near the country's second largest city, Tetovo, the site of clashes and a massive government offensive in March. No injuries were reported.

The eerie pre-election campaign can finally be replaced by the real thing. Instead of smoking pyres of animals on the news every night, we'll get politicians hopping in and out of helicopters. Yet the prospect of an election campaign fills me with gloom. And it's not just me.</p> <p>Outside the intense, self-referential world of Westminster, it's hard to find evidence of interest, let alone burning enthusiasm, for this election. Indeed, this will be a curious non-election - because the single biggest and by far the most compelling debate is about why so many people have gone off politics. Given that a Labour victory is a dead cert, the most interesting figure on polling day will be the turnout and, in particular, how many under 25 bother to vote. The predictions are grim: perhaps a third won't vote, and the figure could be much higher among younger age groups. A 1998 survey found that 71% of 16- to 21-year-olds thought that how you voted made little difference. The turnout will be only a rough guide to the levels of frustration, as many more will vote but with no sense of conviction and little interest.</p> <p>Already, this issue has become the centrepiece of this election as we plunge into a sense of crisis about the health of our democracy - its institutions, our civic responsibilities (or lack of) and the national political culture. Take, for example, Channel 4, which is boldly launching its election coverage with a series titled The End of Politics. This raises the obvious query as to what election coverage there can be if politics is finished.</p> <p>There's no shortage of excellent theories as to the causes of our low political morale. There's the \"corporations wield power, not governments\" theme as expounded by Naomi Klein, George Monbiot and now Noreena Hertz, who is to present The End of Politics series. Colin Crouch makes an interesting argument in a Fabian Society pamphlet that the aberration is not our current lack of interest but the unusual civic-mindedness of the postwar generations - now we are just reverting to type. Or, there's the more straightforward explanation that there's not much of a choice at this election, given the shambolic state of the Tories.</p> <p>Here's another explanation: that the aggressive argumentativeness that now characterises political debate intensely irritates a sizeable section of the population, particularly women and those under 25. It amounts to a kind of polarised squabbling that leads droves of us to conclude \"a plague on all their houses\" and switch off.</p> <p>This phenomenon of Anglo-Saxon political culture is analysed brilliantly by Deborah Tannen in The Argument Culture. An American socio-linguist, she made her name studying the different ways men and women communicate, and now turns the same skills of analysing how language moulds (and reflects) our attitudes to public debate. Her conclusion is that the dominant metaphors are about aggression and competition: \"It is a pervasive warlike atmosphere that makes us approach public dialogue and just about anything we need to accomplish as if it were a fight.\"</p> <p>Effective political participation requires an \"adversarial frame of mind\" so, for example, the \"best way to show you're really thinking is to criticise\" and \"all intellectual inquiry is a game of attack, counterattack and self-defence\". Our perception of politics is frozen into a false dualism as we unquestioningly accept such assumptions as \"there are two sides to every question\" (why always just two?) and that the best way to explore an idea is to get people together who completely disagree with each other. As Tannen succinctly points out, \"smashing heads together does not open minds\".</p> <p>If you like watching heads being smashed, you turn to boxing or The Weakest Link, not Newsnight. As Tannen concludes, \"when a certain type of interaction is the norm, those who feel comfortable with that type of interaction are drawn to participate and those who do not feel comfortable with it recoil and go elsewhere\". The recoil factor is affecting the under-25s and women.</p> <p>How can a generation reared on tolerance as its most strongly held principle participate in the argument culture? If you believe that \"everyone is entitled to their own opinion\", or in an even more relativistic position such as everyone's opinion is equally valid and there's no such thing as objective truth, then what's the point of arguing? At best, it seems a pointless exercise; at worst, it's positively offensive - it smacks of a one-upmanship and an old-fashioned impulse to establish a pecking order.</p> <p>This tolerance ethic is often parcelled up with a powerful impulse to connect with people. In place of models of civic solidarity, we have an emotional solidarity - a democratic friendliness. We may not believe in the same things but we can feel the same things. The 18-year-olds who would have been on demos in the 70s (thriving on a culture of political confrontation), now have an army of friends with whom they are in virtually 24/7 contact, through text messaging, email or phone. It's the phenomenon that has given us up-speak, the intonation that requires the listener to provide constant encouragement; conversation becomes a collaboration rather an exchange, and certainly not a confrontation.</p> <p>The model is the sort of fun-loving amiability typified by Jamie Oliver. This emotional solidarity is partly an Americanisation, partly feminisation (yet another contemporary trend that, as the US writer Thomas Frank points out, is a legacy of the 60s). This ethic of tolerance clashes with English political culture that appears stuck in a time warp, using the style and format of attack and defence of the English public school abetted by an aggressive media culture.</p> <p>The second consequence of the recoil factor is that the spectacle of \"smashing heads\" not only puts people off following politics, it puts them off participating. Tannen breathes new life into the familiar feminist debate that women's political style is different. Everyone argued that Thatcher scotched that theory, but she simply proved what any office demonstrates: that some women are happy playing by the boys' rules, just as some boys hate it. The general and extraordinarily persistent rule is that women are not as comfortable with public speaking, let alone public confrontation.</p> <p>Tannen's observations of children demonstrated how boys fought, physically and verbally, while girls negotiated and manipulated but avoided open conflict. Both preferred to play with their own sex, and when girls and boys played together, the girls were often furious at the aggression of the boys.</p> <p>Until you have a critical mass of women participating in and reporting on politics, you won't know whether there is another way to discuss ideas. And, as this election is likely to see the first drop in the number of women MPs in decades, such a possibility is as remote as ever. Meanwhile, the gap between an adversarial political elite and how, increasingly, people prefer to negotiate conflict will yawn wider and wider.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto&quot;\" madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com\">madeline.bunting@guradian.co.uk</a></p>",

The chancellor intends to tell Brussels it has \"no business\" making recommendations concerning the level of taxes and spending in the UK. Mr Brown's aides said he was \"angry\" at criticisms of his fiscal policy in the broad guidelines for economic policy issued by the commission 10 days ago, and would use today's meeting of European Union economic and finance ministers (Ecofin) to express \"serious concerns\" about the approach taken by Brussels to macro-economic policies. They denied the chancellor had \"picked a fight\" with Europe for reasons of domestic politics, saying\"real points of substance\" were at stake, and the commission had made \"a serious error of judgment\". To the anger of pro-single currency cabinet ministers, Mr Brown is insisting the government concentrate on domestic issues during the election, and his determination to push Europe to the sidelines has been strengthened by the weakness of theeuro and the performance of the European Central Bank (ECB).

The news last week that unseated dot.com employees were falling over themselves to get jobs in the porn industry was more than just a sign of the times. Disillusioned dot.commers, hacked off with constantly being bounced around from one failed outfit to the next, reasoned that the only fail-safe solution was pornography. </p> <p>It wasn't such a big surprise. Porn is one of the few profitable industries on the internet, and \"sex\" has long been the most popular online search term, closely followed by \"porn\", \"nude\", \"XXX\", \"Playboy\" and \"erotic stories\". </p> <p>While the rest of the net is reeling from crumbling ad revenues, the sex industry has not even taken a hit because its main revenue stream is subscriptions, not advertising. It's that old adage again: Sex always sells. No amount of economic downturn will affect this phenomenally successful industry that is becoming increasingly acceptable, especially among young professionals. </p> <p>Yet companies such as <a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\">Yahoo!</a> are opting out of the porn industry. Given the demand, the big business and the job security,this seems like a mad decision. Why? </p> <p>It all boils down to a public outcry, and a feeling that one of the biggest and arguably one of the most influential internet companies in the world shouldn't be dealing in the business of porn. Despite the fact that Yahoo! has sold X-rated products for more than two years, when the Los Angeles Times ran a piece suggesting it was expanding its collection a month ago, a huge debate ensued. A few days later, Yahoo! backed down and said it would cease selling adult products, stop accepting banner ads from porn sites, cut out classifieds and auction adult-type items, and pledged it would clamp down on sex-related message boards and clubs. The misconception, however, is that it will outlaw porn on its site, which it insists is not the case. A search still throws up 671 sites for \"porn\" and if Yahoo! users want to buy porn videos, they are redirected to an external site. </p> <p>To make the changes Yahoo! is currently introducing what has been described as \"pretty extensive filtering software\" but teething problems are expected. The reduction of porn on Yahoo.com won't spell the death of Yahoo!, but it could derail its profit projections. Despite the new porn exclusion software, though, the company is still making its mind up. Last week, faced with a barrage of criticism from web users, it came back and said no decisions had been taken on whether the changes to its adult porn section would be permanent. \"It's the internet, so lots of things are possible,\" said Yahoo! spokesman Jackson Holtz, insisting it was just a re-evaluation of adult content across the network. </p> <p>Clearly, Yahoo! is playing it by ear. It doesn't want to alienate users or conservative forces, nor does it want to rule out forever a guaranteed moneyspinner. Yahoo! has been put in a glaringly uncomfortable spotlight. It has now publicly back-peddled on a plan to expand its adult materials and caused a flap among other big internet portals, concerned about public approval. Terra Lycos, which operates a number of Lycos portals around the world, has now chipped in and announced it is re-evaluating its own porn policy, while <a href=\"http://www.msn.com\">MSN</a> has reaffirmed that it has a strict policy on porn. </p> <p>Of all the bigger players in the portal market, <a href=\"http://www.altavista.com\">AltaVista</a> is one of the few that seems to offer no-holds-barred access to pornographic material. A quick search using the term \"porn\" brings up an array of hardcore images, video clips and links to sites that are advertised using very explicit language. </p> <p>MSN has already gone the whole hog and removed any evidence of adult-related merchandise. It moderates chatrooms and has a tough policy on links to porn. In fact, after entering the term \"porn\" in the search engine, the user is immediately warned: \"You have entered a search term that is likely to return adult content.\" There are no adult videos to be found on the site, but if users want that kind of material, they are sent out of MSN confines into the unrestrained web where technically they are no longer the responsibility of MSN. </p> <p>Therein lies the great irony. A significant proportion of web users want access to porn and to this end will locate porn and buy it, with or without the help of Yahoo!. Censorship of this kind doesn't work. If Yahoo!, the second biggest website in the world, doesn't take a piece of this action, it will lose out. Pundits and users alike believe Yahoo! has got itself into unnecessarily uncomfortable territory because of its willingness to purge itself of adult materials, instead of forcing families to install filter software on their computers. </p> <p>Yahoo! members spoke out last week, saying they felt betrayed and were planning to petition the portal after it quietly reconfigured its adult-themed clubs, message boards and chatrooms. Yahoo! has now made these areas much more difficult to find and even disabled some search links so that in order to find a club, users have to know the correct internet address and type it in directly. List members argue angrily that this tactic will ultimately lead to them disappearing altogether. </p> <p>Ken Bradman, a 23-year-old web developer in Phoenix, has spoken out on the issue and is organising a protest club. \"If they completely eliminate adult material from the site, they're going to lose a lot of members who are interested in that. I can guarantee you it's going to be a huge chunk of Yahoo!'s user base,\" he proclaimed last week. </p> <p>Already some club members have reposted links to their clubs in different sections of the site to show they won't be silenced. </p> <p>Yahoo! refuses to comment further on the porn issue, but the UK office is happy to point out its tight policy. \"We have a different position to the US. We've already taken steps to reduce adult content on the site [last year] and we've tightened up chatroom controls,\" says a spokesman. </p> <p>The UK office of MSN says much the same: \"<a href=\"http://www.msn.co.uk\">MSN.co.uk</a> has a zero tolerance policy toward retailers on the shopping channel distributing pornographic material from its site. Since 'top shelf pornography' is not illegal for consenting adults over the age of 18 material of this nature is categorised in communities as 'adult' on the MSN site. Users searching under adult terms on MSN Search will be asked to confirm that they are wanting to access adult material and if they answer positively will be diverted on to a separate site - Nightsurf.\"</p> <p>The issue has become much more than the removal of pornographic videos, the blocking of under 18s, and links to child porn sites; it has opened up a whole can of worms about freedom of speech on the internet.

He agreed to this inter view two months ago, after declining all press attention since returning from New York to direct Alan Bennett's The Lady in the Van with Maggie Smith, Cressida with Michael Gambon, and Orpheus Descending with Helen Mirren. </p> <p>Hytner is the man who, in 1989, directed a musical about Vietnam starring Jonathan Pryce and a helicopter. To his stupefaction, Miss Saigon ran for 10 years in London. In New York, it recouped its $10.9m investment in 39 weeks. He was on a percentage for both, which means he need never work again, although the idea of idleness appals him. \"The worst 15 months of my life were spent developing a movie which was never made.\" He's too discreet to mention names, but it was the projected movie of Chicago. </p> <p>Hytner was the first of the 1990s theatrical Britpack to go to the movies. \"A terrific surprise,\" he announces with relish, \"but terrifying. You are surrounded by people who know so much more than you do. I assure you, this is a universal feeling among theatre people who go into film. I am terrified at the beginning of a day on set in a way I'm not in a rehearsal room. That's a marvellous feeling.\" </p> <p>Both theatre and film appealed to this nice but not very Jewish boy growing up in Manchester, but in the 1970s British clout in the movie industry was non-existent. It wasn't until 1981 that Colin Welland yelled \"The British are coming!\" when collecting an Oscar for Chariots of Fire. Thanks to Alan Bennett's insistence, Hytner made it to the screen with The Madness of King George, after directing the play at the National in 1991. Four Oscar nominations later, he made The Crucible with Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder, and The Object of My Affection. This beguiling comedy was also a smart and charming commercial success, and - rarest of all - a big-screen hit for one of the Friends cast: Jennifer Aniston falling for the post-Clueless Paul Rudd. </p> <p>The latter went on to play Orsino in Hytner's heartbreakingly beautiful Twelfth Night at New York's Lincoln Center. It generated enough heat to persuade the American public service broadcaster PBS to show the final matinee live on TV. \"They said, 'Think of it as a live sports event', and as soon as you do, the absurdity of theatre on TV disappears. Of course, looking at the tape, there are things which make you cringe, but going out live it was terrific - and 2m people watched it. We should think about that.\" </p> <p>Aha. Is this the beginning of a manifesto? Hytner has always had a taste for the large-scale. His first \"proper paid job\" post-Cambridge was at English National Opera, assisting on productions playing to 2,358 people a night. Now he's back in a large auditorium, the 1,100-seat Olivier Theatre for The Winter's Tale, frequently bracketed among \"Shakespeare's problem plays\". Hytner can't see the problem. \"A successful, powerful man with one beautiful child and another on the way has his best friend to stay. The idea that he might throw it all away, bring the whole thing down, destroy his marriage, turn on his wife and his best friend for no apparent reason - we now understand psychology as a series of rapid and totally illogical reverses.\" He believes everything is meticulously explained and plausible. \"Yet there is this air of wonder, of grace, amazement.\" </p> <p>Two other factors determined his choice. \"Alex Jennings, Deborah Findlay, Phil Daniels, Julian Wadham, Claire Skinner - we're old friends. They're playing middle-aged parts now, and that's what the play is about, struggling to come to terms with being no longer young. And then there's another reason . . .\" He takes a deep breath. \"We have to try harder to make these plays more exciting in larger spaces where they work best. There is something ultimately self-destructive for theatre about this long withdrawing roar into the studio space. We will lose our audience and end up performing for each other.\" </p> <p>Without me even mentioning the words \"National\" and \"running the\" we are suddenly on the hustings. His voice climbs as he grows increasingly animated. \"It's much easier to act in studio spaces, easier to direct and, if you can get in, it's very easy to be smug about being there. But if there's to be a National Theatre, then it has to operate on a national scale.\" </p> <p>This is fighting talk. With the exception of Michael Grandage's celebrated work at Sheffield Crucible, almost all the recent landmark productions of the classics have been in studios. \"The routine use of the 300-seat Cottesloe for the popular classical repertoire will ultimately be a disaster. If there's something startling to be said on that scale - like Steven Pimlott's RSC Richard II - or something experimental then fine, but as a general rule it won't get us anywhere. The energy it takes to embrace 1,000 people is inherent to these plays. People will stop knowing how to act in them, audiences will stop knowing how to listen to them.\" </p> <p>He's on a roll. \"The repertoire pattern produced fantastic stuff but I don't see a hunger for it any more. Nearly every play that is unequivocally worth doing has been done here. So now what?\" He wants to encourage writers to make the leap to the larger stages. Dominic Dromgoole tried - and failed - to do that at the Old Vic. Hytner admits he lacks the skill to develop talent from scratch - \"I'm more of the parasite who sucks the blood and spits it out for the big crowd\" - but points to the National studio which develops writers' gifts. \"The trick will be to identify those among them who want, as it were, to go wide.\" Like who? Mark Ravenhill, for one. Hytner is taking his new play, Mother Clapp's Molly House, to the 900-seat Lyttelton. </p> <p>\"Mark's play has got the necessary chutzpah; it's a big, extravagant play.\" So he's officially up for The Job? \"I have no idea. I feel slightly sick about the possibility of putting myself in the running - which I have not done. I've never run a theatre, which is why it's slightly surreal to me that this question comes up.\" </p> <p>He insists it should be offered to Stephen Daldry. However Daldry is making a movie with Julianne Moore, Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman. A movie is a solid year's work. That means no nipping back to sort out directorial disasters at the National, as Trevor Nunn had to do - twice - last year. Which is why the most convincing of all rumours is the one that has the chairman, Sir Christopher Hogg, approaching Daldry to assemble a package to enable him to run the building via a group of senior lieutenants. Hytner dismisses the idea of separate directors running each theatre as unworkable but thinks a team of directors and/or producers is the way forward. </p> <p>\"What I wouldn't and couldn't do is run it the way it has been run. The repertoire must be more flexible.\" He wants to be able to exploit successes and axe flops. \"You can't do that at the moment because the leaflet comes out at least two months in advance of the first show within that season. Is this possible? I don't know. Can it be afforded? I don't know.\" </p> <p>The only thing he's sure of is wanting to continue making majestic plays like The Winter's Tale work there. On his return to the building this year, he realised how much he'd missed everyone. So much for the notion that he and his work are lacking in sentiment. Maybe that's why this private man finally agreed to talk. </p> <p>\"I'm always slightly embarrassed by publicity,\" he sighs, ruefully. \"When I read pieces about friends and colleagues, I tend to sit there grumbling about how such-and-such is not true. So one always suspects oneself of offering up the same self-serving bollocks.\" So everything he's told me is utterly without spin?

      "body": "<p>Decide for yourself whether to believe this, but according to a new report there were only 16 cases of international terrorism in the Middle East last year.</p> <p>That is the lowest number for any region in the world apart from North America (where there were none at all). Europe had 30 cases - almost twice as many as the Middle East - and Latin America came top with 193.</p> <p>The figures come from the US state department's annual review of global terrorism, which has just been published on the internet. Worldwide, the report says confidently, \"there were 423 international terrorist attacks in 2000, an increase of 8% from the 392 attacks recorded during 1999\".</p> <p>No doubt a lot of painstaking effort went into counting them, but the statistics are fundamentally meaningless because, as the report points out, \"no one definition of terrorism has gained universal acceptance\".</p> <p>That is an understatement. While most people agree that terrorism exists, few can agree on what it is. A recent book discussing attempts by the UN and other international bodies to define terrorism runs to three volumes and 1,866 pages without reaching any firm conclusion.</p> <p>Using the definition preferred by the state department, terrorism is: \"Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant* targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience.\" (The asterisk is important, as we shall see later.)</p> <p>\"International\" terrorism - the subject of the American report - is defined as \"terrorism involving citizens or the territory of more than one country\".</p> <p>The key point about terrorism, on which almost everyone agrees, is that it's politically motivated.

      "bodyText": "Decide for yourself whether to believe this, but according to a new report there were only 16 cases of international terrorism in the Middle East last year. That is the lowest number for any region in the world apart from North America (where there were none at all). Europe had 30 cases - almost twice as many as the Middle East - and Latin America came top with 193. The figures come from the US state department's annual review of global terrorism, which has just been published on the internet. Worldwide, the report says confidently, \"there were 423 international terrorist attacks in 2000, an increase of 8% from the 392 attacks recorded during 1999\". No doubt a lot of painstaking effort went into counting them, but the statistics are fundamentally meaningless because, as the report points out, \"no one definition of terrorism has gained universal acceptance\". That is an understatement. While most people agree that terrorism exists, few can agree on what it is. A recent book discussing attempts by the UN and other international bodies to define terrorism runs to three volumes and 1,866 pages without reaching any firm conclusion. Using the definition preferred by the state department, terrorism is: \"Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant* targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience.\" (The asterisk is important, as we shall see later.) \"International\" terrorism - the subject of the American report - is defined as \"terrorism involving citizens or the territory of more than one country\". The key point about terrorism, on which almost everyone agrees, is that it's politically motivated. This is what distinguishes it from, say, murder or football hooliganism. But this also causes a problem for those who compile statistics because the motive is not always clear - especially if no one has claimed responsibility. So the American report states - correctly - that there were no confirmed terrorist incidents in Saudi Arabia last year. There were, nevertheless, three unexplained bombings and one shooting incident, all directed against foreigners. Another essential ingredient (you might think) is that terrorism is calculated to terrorise the public or a particular section of it. The American definition does not mention spreading terror at all, because that would exclude attacks against property. It is, after all, impossible to frighten an inanimate object. Among last year's attacks, 152 were directed against a pipeline in Colombia which is owned by multinational oil companies. Such attacks are of concern to the United States and so a definition is required which allows them to be counted.

A few years ago, for example, the Islamic Army in Yemen warned foreigners to leave the country if they valued their lives but did not actually carry out its threat. More recently, a group of Israeli peace activists were arrested for driving around in a loudspeaker van, announcing a curfew of the kind that is imposed on Palestinians. Terrifying for any Israelis who believed it, but was it terrorism? Another characteristic of terrorism, according to some people, is that targets must be random - the intention being to make everyone fear they might be the next victim. Some of the Hamas suicide bombings appear to follow this principle but when attacks are aimed at predictable targets (such as the military) they are less likely to terrorise the public at large. Definitions usually try to distinguish between terrorism and warfare. In general this means that attacks on soldiers are warfare and those against civilians are terrorism, but the dividing lines quickly become blurred. The state department regards attacks against \"noncombatant* targets\" as terrorism. But follow the asterisk to the small print and you find that \"noncombatants\" includes both civilians and military personnel who are unarmed or off duty at the time. Several examples are given, such as the 1986 disco bombing in Berlin, which killed two servicemen. The most lethal bombing in the Middle East last year was the suicide attack on USS Cole in Aden harbour which killed 17 American sailors and injured 39 more. As the ship was armed and its crew on duty at the time, why is this classified as terrorism? Look again at the small print, which adds: \"We also consider as acts of terrorism attacks on military installations or on armed military personnel when a state of military hostilities does not exist at the site, such as bombings against US bases.\" A similar question arises with Palestinian attacks on quasi-military targets such as Israeli settlements. Many settlers are armed (with weapons supplied by the army) and the settlements themselves - though they contain civilians - might be considered military targets because they are there to consolidate a military occupation. If, under the state department rules, Palestinian mortar attacks on settlements count as terrorism, it would be reasonable to expect Israeli rocket attacks on Palestinian communities to be treated in the same way - but they are not. In the American definition, terrorism can never be inflicted by a state. Israeli treatment of the Palestinians is classified as a human rights issue (for which the Israelis get a rap over the knuckles) in a separate state department report. Denying that states can commit terrorism is generally useful, because it gets the US and its allies off the hook in a variety of situations.

      "body": "<p>It is difficult to believe now that Militant Tendency was once considered a serious threat to British democracy. Indeed if you are under 40 there is a good chance you do not know what it was. But in the early 1980s there really were people who conspired to take over the Labour party for Trotskyite ends, stealthily securing their majorities on the general management committees of local parties so they could send like-minded MPs to foment revolution at Westminster. </p> <p>The health secretary, Alan Milburn, was part of the \"hard left\" in those days. He had a quarrel with Militant, but as he described it to me it sounded like a quarrel about means, not ends. \"I didn't like their methods; I thought they were pretty crude and unsophisticated.\" </p> <p>Slipping into the ideological vernacular of the day, he said: \"I didn't instinctively like the making of impossibilist demands that could never be met. Some\" - this said rather defensively - \"would regard that as pragmatism, but I like to think that, coming from somewhere that had real problems, I see the need for real solutions.\" </p> <p>Somewhere in there lies the key to the journey Alan Milburn has made from revolutionary firebrand to the archetype of the New Labour manager - a cabinet minister - a journey he describes as a symbol of what has happened to his party. </p> <p>His memories of a Co Durham childhood are without any hint of the intense emotion or the delicate north-eastern light that made the film Billy Elliot blaze so brightly in our imagination (\"I went to see Billy Elliot. I thought it was fantastic, but it wasn't me.\" Why not? \"I was never interested in dance\"). </p> <p>But that childhood had many of the elements that feed the southerner's stereotyping: a single mother, a town built around a long dead mine, and reflex Labour loyalties. Labour \"was in your guts and in your heart\". So far, so much standard stuff. There was a first political love affair that went wrong. Milburn was captivated by the romance of leftwing history spun in EP Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class, and began research on 18th century radicalism in the north-east. </p> <p>The PhD, at Newcastle University, ran into the ground. \"I was riveted by the idea that there was a fine tradition of radicalism in various parts of the country connected with the burgeoning of a new form of ideology, which was expressing itself in Europe with the Enlightenment, with the French revolution and in America too. But I found it pretty hard to unearth much of this in the north-east of England; sadly, there wasn't a red Tyneside to match the red Clydeside.\" </p> <p><strong> Clarity</strong><br> </p> <p>Milburn packed it in - an early sign that he is more doer than thinker. For him the history you make matters more than the history you learn. Something odd happened to his speech patterns when he described the next phase of his life: a certain imprecision of memory that sat uneasily with the intellectual clarity of the man who had so confidently outlined his wholesale restructuring of NHS trusts the day before we talked. </p> <p>Milburn worked in Days of Hope, a leftwing bookshop in Newcastle, and he did not deny the suggestion that he had been a \"Trot\". He had been a member of the International Marxist group, the British section of Leon Trotsky's Fourth International, but he conceded that some of his political beliefs in those days were \"crackers\". He said: \"I probably thought that the best solution for any economic problem was for the state to run it.\" </p> <p>World revolution and all those other things? \"I was never that mad. I wasn't an anarchist _ I was rather more structured than that - probably. I wasn't for sort of building barricades and so on - I don't think. But I probably thought at the time that parliament was pretty much an irrelevance in terms of changing people's lives.\" </p> <p>There is one intriguing clue to the Alan Milburn of today in his account of his Days of Hope life. \"I personally developed the badge market on Tyneside,\" he said. Shortly after he left the shop it went bankrupt. \"I don't know whether that's a reflection on how I ran it or on how those who succeeded me ran it.\" Even then, competence mattered. </p> <p>The decisive moment on his road to Damascus came when, as a trade union official, he led a campaign to stop the closure of the Sunderland shipyard, announced in 1986. \"Here was a modern industrial facility with a lot going for it: a skilled workforce, hundreds of millions of pounds of investment had gone into it, lots of orders.\" </p> <p>He insisted that the decision to shut it down was made for political reasons. A deal had been done with the European commission to reduce Britain's ship building capacity, and Sunderland had to go so that the politically sensitive Harland and Woolfe in Belfast could be kept open. </p> <p>Milburn lost his battle. He is not a politician with a reputation for forging fine phrases, but his comment on the lesson he drew is often quoted: \"It taught me,\" he said, \"that life's a bitch.\" </p> <p>In fact, he learned something more profound than respect for the harsh realities of a global economy: he learned that \"political decisions matter\". If there is such a thing as Milburnism that lesson lies at its heart. He is driven by a deep conviction about the importance of the political process itself. </p> <p>It lends a puritanical cast to much of what he says; indeed puritanism is a consistent thread that links today's secretary of state with the revolutionary of two decades ago. \"The thing about that form of politics, which people who haven't been in it find difficult to understand,\" he said of his Newcastle bookshop days, \"is that it is an extremely puritanical form of leftwing politics. We believed in the cause to the detriment of any other form of life, including the wages that we were paid.\" </p> <p>Today the puritanism shows itself in the occasional flash of irritation at what he obviously sees as the fripperies of political life - including interviews like this one. Milburn runs one of the biggest public services in the world and has been talked of as a future prime minister. Yet his personality remains largely hidden behind seven terse lines in Who's Who. </p> <p><strong> Soap opera</strong><br> </p> <p>He conceded that \"if you've got a position of responsibility people want an insight to what motivates you and what sort of person you are, and fair enough,\" but \"what I resent about the way that modern politics is sometimes portrayed [is that] it's portrayed as soap opera.\" </p> <p>His Whitehall office is not far from where the scaffold was erected for King Charles I. The health secretary could have written a fine manifesto for Roundheadism. And yet there are flashes too of the US Democrat and the quintessentially American belief in the pursuit of happiness as a legitimate political goal. He roadtested one of those anecdotes politicians like to use to make a point. He was hailed on a plane journey from the north-east by someone he had scarcely seen since they had been at school together. \"He said, 'I make pop videos for Elton John and U2 and people like that'. I said that sounds interesting. He said, 'Yes and it's very lucrative' - he'd made a fortune.\" The anecdote was told to illustrate his commitment to a way of ordering things that allows everyone to fulfil their potential. But his chuckle on the word \"lucrative\" provided a glimpse of the share option-owning chief executive he could undoubtedly have been. </p> <p>When Milburn restructured the health service last week - cutting back on bureaucrats and decentralising decision-making - the Tories accused him of stealing their clothes. I asked him to define what was distinctively Labour about the plan, and he said it was inspired by a determination to give people power over their own lives. \"I remember as a kid coming back to my house on a council estate and finding that the door was yellow, and when I'd left it in the morning it was red. Somebody had done that to me, or to my family, without even asking me. Well that's a bad thing\" - the suspicion of nanny state power that inspired so many libertarian Thatcherites in the 1980s. </p> <p>Push him a little and Milburn is prepared to admit what a long way his political journey has taken him. He called it simply a question of \"growing up\" and coming to terms with the fact that \"the world has changed\". </p> <p>\"There was huge pain that the Labour party had to go through and people like me had to go through,\" he said. \"I had to look at what I believed in, what I thought was right, and realise that not only was it not acceptable to people out there, but that it was probably wrong in many ways.\" </p> <p>He is acutely sensitive to the perception that ideology has been replaced by managerialism. It has been said of his generation of ministers - Geoff Hoon and Stephen Byers - that they never \"coined a memorable phrase or thought a dangerous thought\". </p> <p>\"I think people of my generation, because we've grown up with 24-hour media, have a sense of what is the right thing to say. It depends what you think people want of their politicians. I don't think politics is a circus, I don't think it's theatre. I think it's a pretty serious business.\" </p> <p>I did not directly raise the suggestion that he and his generation of ministers might be a little _ well, dull, but he worried away at it none the less. \"If interesting is mad,\" he said finally, \"then I don't want to be interesting.\" <br> Fast track Route to cabinet \u0095 Born January 27, 1958, in Birmingham. </p> <p>\u0095 Raised by his unmarried mother, a secretary in the NHS, in the old coalmining village of Tow Law in County Durham. </p> <p>\u0095 Educated at John Marlay school, Newcastle, and Stokesley comprehensive, North Yorkshire; Lancaster University (BA Hons in history). </p> <p>\u0095 Married Barbara \"Mo\" O'Toole, now a Labour MEP.

He is not a politician with a reputation for forging fine phrases, but his comment on the lesson he drew is often quoted: \"It taught me,\" he said, \"that life's a bitch.\" In fact, he learned something more profound than respect for the harsh realities of a global economy: he learned that \"political decisions matter\". If there is such a thing as Milburnism that lesson lies at its heart. He is driven by a deep conviction about the importance of the political process itself. It lends a puritanical cast to much of what he says; indeed puritanism is a consistent thread that links today's secretary of state with the revolutionary of two decades ago. \"The thing about that form of politics, which people who haven't been in it find difficult to understand,\" he said of his Newcastle bookshop days, \"is that it is an extremely puritanical form of leftwing politics. We believed in the cause to the detriment of any other form of life, including the wages that we were paid.\" Today the puritanism shows itself in the occasional flash of irritation at what he obviously sees as the fripperies of political life - including interviews like this one. Milburn runs one of the biggest public services in the world and has been talked of as a future prime minister. Yet his personality remains largely hidden behind seven terse lines in Who's Who. Soap opera He conceded that \"if you've got a position of responsibility people want an insight to what motivates you and what sort of person you are, and fair enough,\" but \"what I resent about the way that modern politics is sometimes portrayed [is that] it's portrayed as soap opera.\" His Whitehall office is not far from where the scaffold was erected for King Charles I. The health secretary could have written a fine manifesto for Roundheadism. And yet there are flashes too of the US Democrat and the quintessentially American belief in the pursuit of happiness as a legitimate political goal. He roadtested one of those anecdotes politicians like to use to make a point. He was hailed on a plane journey from the north-east by someone he had scarcely seen since they had been at school together. \"He said, 'I make pop videos for Elton John and U2 and people like that'. I said that sounds interesting. He said, 'Yes and it's very lucrative' - he'd made a fortune.\" The anecdote was told to illustrate his commitment to a way of ordering things that allows everyone to fulfil their potential. But his chuckle on the word \"lucrative\" provided a glimpse of the share option-owning chief executive he could undoubtedly have been. When Milburn restructured the health service last week - cutting back on bureaucrats and decentralising decision-making - the Tories accused him of stealing their clothes. I asked him to define what was distinctively Labour about the plan, and he said it was inspired by a determination to give people power over their own lives. \"I remember as a kid coming back to my house on a council estate and finding that the door was yellow, and when I'd left it in the morning it was red. Somebody had done that to me, or to my family, without even asking me. Well that's a bad thing\" - the suspicion of nanny state power that inspired so many libertarian Thatcherites in the 1980s. Push him a little and Milburn is prepared to admit what a long way his political journey has taken him. He called it simply a question of \"growing up\" and coming to terms with the fact that \"the world has changed\". \"There was huge pain that the Labour party had to go through and people like me had to go through,\" he said. \"I had to look at what I believed in, what I thought was right, and realise that not only was it not acceptable to people out there, but that it was probably wrong in many ways.\" He is acutely sensitive to the perception that ideology has been replaced by managerialism. It has been said of his generation of ministers - Geoff Hoon and Stephen Byers - that they never \"coined a memorable phrase or thought a dangerous thought\". \"I think people of my generation, because we've grown up with 24-hour media, have a sense of what is the right thing to say. It depends what you think people want of their politicians. I don't think politics is a circus, I don't think it's theatre. I think it's a pretty serious business.\" I did not directly raise the suggestion that he and his generation of ministers might be a little _ well, dull, but he worried away at it none the less. \"If interesting is mad,\" he said finally, \"then I don't want to be interesting.\" Fast track Route to cabinet \u0095 Born January 27, 1958, in Birmingham. \u0095 Raised by his unmarried mother, a secretary in the NHS, in the old coalmining village of Tow Law in County Durham. \u0095 Educated at John Marlay school, Newcastle, and Stokesley comprehensive, North Yorkshire; Lancaster University (BA Hons in history). \u0095 Married Barbara \"Mo\" O'Toole, now a Labour MEP.

Liverpool had stolen a march in music, but its rival at the other end of the ship canal was much better connected to the rest of Britain and Europe. As Manchester tried to reinvent itself, it began to look the part of a modern, business-driven city. In 1960, Manchester Midland station was connected to London St Pancras by the svelte new Blue Pullman service, a fast, air-conditioned diesel train that seemed light years ahead of the four-hour steam services from Piccadilly to Euston. </p> <p>Within the next few years came the electrification of the west coast main line with the new blue-and-grey InterCity trains belting down to London in just two and a half hours. To cash in on the Manchester business market, BEA put its new DeHavilland Trident jets on the route to Heathrow. The motorway closed in and there was a plan, since abandoned, to build an orbital super road. </p> <p>An architecture rose up on concrete foundations to match the ambition of this dashing new InterCity world. All cool Swiss graphics and designer logos, it was as if those giants of modern architecture, Walter Gropius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, had ventured to Manchester. </p> <p>Just look at the Manhattan-like CIS Tower (GS Hay and Sir John Burnet, Tait and Partners; interiors by Sir Misha Black and the Design Research Unit, 1962). In the right light it looks a bit like the sort of thing Mies was designing at the time for downtown Toronto: bronze-framed banks with travertine-lined lobbies potted with abstract sculptures. Or, it is a cluster of sleek towers, borrowing from SOM (Skidmore Owings and Merrill), who gave the US its corporate architectural look until postmodern design bludgeoned its way on to the skylines of New York and Chicago. Elsewhere in Manchester, there were bold new offices such as Aldine House (Leach, Rhodes and Walker, 1967) and, further out, the muscular Middleton council offices (Israel Lyons and Ellis, 1965). </p> <p>If you look closely, and in the wrong light, the Mancunian office buildings of the InterCity era are not up to the impeccable standards of Mies. \"There was a spirit of optimism and confidence in buildings of this period in Manchester,\" says Graham Russell, director of the city's Cube gallery. \"But the light in Manchester is often drab so we commissioned G.ten, a group of photographers, to portray these buildings afresh as if they were bathed in the kind of west coast light that makes Julius Schulman's photographs of new Californian architecture of the 50s and 60s so seductive.\" But today's architecture is not so seductive. \"When you look at what's happening in the city now, in architectural terms, it's disappointing. Manchester might be hip and successful in many ways, yet the new architecture, for the most part, is apologetic, second-rate, po-mo stuff, and it keeps going up.\" </p> <p>Manchester International, the new exhibition at Cube curated by Tom Jefferies of the Manchester School of Architecture, is an intriguing attempt to re-evaluate the very architecture that, for whatever reason, Manchester appears to have turned its back on. The city plays up its spectacular Victorian heritage - and why not when the neo-Gothic City Hall by Alfred Waterhouse is one of Europe's greatest civic buildings? </p> <p>Yet a modern masterpiece, such as the Piccadilly Plaza and Hotel (Covell Matthews, 1964), a concrete mega-structure that rivalled the best of avant-garde French and Japanese contemporary design, is under threat after years of physical neglect and visual abuse. The hotel was given a sprucing up in the early 1990s, but not in the spirit of the 1960s design it was conceived in. </p> <p>\"It's like a set from Thunderbirds,\" says Jefferies, \"with its great concrete cantilevers and spiral entry ramp. Now it looks as if it's going to be clad in shiny silver panels; the whole point of its design will be lost.\" If this genuinely exciting 1960s building was in London, New York or almost anywhere on the continent, it would have been snapped up by a hotelier such as Ian Schrager, who would respect its design and could turn it into a hyper-fashionable overnight stay. </p> <p>\"The Piccadilly is still knocked,\" says Russell. \"It's an awesome structure, but developers and the local business community are still told it's no good. Many of the 25 or so buildings we've put on show at Cube are now threatened with demolition or insensitive rebuilding.\" </p> <p>Yet these buildings - or at least the spirit they were designed in - are popular among a younger generation of not just architects, but students, clubbers and Wallpaper* readers too. There is something about the crispness of this early 1960s vision that is attractive as we emerge from the slough of postmodern design. </p> <p>If Manchester city council, local businesses and developers wanted to, they could trade on the city's 1960s heritage as much as they milk its Victorian lineage. What has put them off? Why do they seem out of step with the design tastes of a younger generation who would love to hang out in a swish new bar in a sensitively revamped Piccadilly Hotel? </p> <p>Two words come to mind: Arndale Centre. This absurdly ugly 1970s retail termites' nest was meant to transform the heart of the city. It did, but much to its detriment. Far from being an update of an elegant Victorian shopping arcade, the Arndale Centre became a byword for bad modern architecture. It has been remodelled since the IRA bomb that devastated central Manchester five years ago, but it gave the city a bad name for years. </p> <p>Manchester, especially now it has its successful tram network, upbeat Chinatown and buzzy nightlife, does have the air, on a good day, of a confident European city. Each weekend, some 140,000 visitors come to indulge in the city's boozy nightlife. Huge sums have been spent on rebuilding the centre, smartening up the Canal Street quarter, building a major new sports complex on the edge of the city, lining the canal with yuppie apartment blocks, stretching the investment down to Salford Quays, the bombast of the Lowry Centre and the explosion of ideas that give form to Daniel Libeskind's Imperial War Museum North. </p> <p>What the city needs now is to rethink what a modern look could actually mean in architectural and design terms. A little less of the late flowering and now wilting postmodern would help; this and some energetic buildings with the confidence and optimism of the Manchester International period. </p> <p>Cube itself is helping to lead the way with its new restaurant, designed by Daniel Libeskind and due to open next spring. David Chipperfield has rebuilt the Cornerhouse art gallery, Michael Hopkins is at work extending the city art gallery and Tadao Ando has designed a pavilion for Piccadilly gardens. Now, who can rescue the Piccadilly Hotel? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Manchester International: 60s Modernist Architecture in Manchester is at Cube, 113-115 Portland Street, Manchester, from Friday to July 4.

If you look closely, and in the wrong light, the Mancunian office buildings of the InterCity era are not up to the impeccable standards of Mies. \"There was a spirit of optimism and confidence in buildings of this period in Manchester,\" says Graham Russell, director of the city's Cube gallery. \"But the light in Manchester is often drab so we commissioned G.ten, a group of photographers, to portray these buildings afresh as if they were bathed in the kind of west coast light that makes Julius Schulman's photographs of new Californian architecture of the 50s and 60s so seductive.\" But today's architecture is not so seductive. \"When you look at what's happening in the city now, in architectural terms, it's disappointing. Manchester might be hip and successful in many ways, yet the new architecture, for the most part, is apologetic, second-rate, po-mo stuff, and it keeps going up.\" Manchester International, the new exhibition at Cube curated by Tom Jefferies of the Manchester School of Architecture, is an intriguing attempt to re-evaluate the very architecture that, for whatever reason, Manchester appears to have turned its back on. The city plays up its spectacular Victorian heritage - and why not when the neo-Gothic City Hall by Alfred Waterhouse is one of Europe's greatest civic buildings? Yet a modern masterpiece, such as the Piccadilly Plaza and Hotel (Covell Matthews, 1964), a concrete mega-structure that rivalled the best of avant-garde French and Japanese contemporary design, is under threat after years of physical neglect and visual abuse. The hotel was given a sprucing up in the early 1990s, but not in the spirit of the 1960s design it was conceived in. \"It's like a set from Thunderbirds,\" says Jefferies, \"with its great concrete cantilevers and spiral entry ramp. Now it looks as if it's going to be clad in shiny silver panels; the whole point of its design will be lost.\" If this genuinely exciting 1960s building was in London, New York or almost anywhere on the continent, it would have been snapped up by a hotelier such as Ian Schrager, who would respect its design and could turn it into a hyper-fashionable overnight stay. \"The Piccadilly is still knocked,\" says Russell. \"It's an awesome structure, but developers and the local business community are still told it's no good. Many of the 25 or so buildings we've put on show at Cube are now threatened with demolition or insensitive rebuilding.\" Yet these buildings - or at least the spirit they were designed in - are popular among a younger generation of not just architects, but students, clubbers and Wallpaper* readers too. There is something about the crispness of this early 1960s vision that is attractive as we emerge from the slough of postmodern design. If Manchester city council, local businesses and developers wanted to, they could trade on the city's 1960s heritage as much as they milk its Victorian lineage. What has put them off? Why do they seem out of step with the design tastes of a younger generation who would love to hang out in a swish new bar in a sensitively revamped Piccadilly Hotel? Two words come to mind: Arndale Centre. This absurdly ugly 1970s retail termites' nest was meant to transform the heart of the city. It did, but much to its detriment. Far from being an update of an elegant Victorian shopping arcade, the Arndale Centre became a byword for bad modern architecture. It has been remodelled since the IRA bomb that devastated central Manchester five years ago, but it gave the city a bad name for years. Manchester, especially now it has its successful tram network, upbeat Chinatown and buzzy nightlife, does have the air, on a good day, of a confident European city. Each weekend, some 140,000 visitors come to indulge in the city's boozy nightlife. Huge sums have been spent on rebuilding the centre, smartening up the Canal Street quarter, building a major new sports complex on the edge of the city, lining the canal with yuppie apartment blocks, stretching the investment down to Salford Quays, the bombast of the Lowry Centre and the explosion of ideas that give form to Daniel Libeskind's Imperial War Museum North. What the city needs now is to rethink what a modern look could actually mean in architectural and design terms. A little less of the late flowering and now wilting postmodern would help; this and some energetic buildings with the confidence and optimism of the Manchester International period. Cube itself is helping to lead the way with its new restaurant, designed by Daniel Libeskind and due to open next spring. David Chipperfield has rebuilt the Cornerhouse art gallery, Michael Hopkins is at work extending the city art gallery and Tadao Ando has designed a pavilion for Piccadilly gardens. Now, who can rescue the Piccadilly Hotel? \u00b7 Manchester International: 60s Modernist Architecture in Manchester is at Cube, 113-115 Portland Street, Manchester, from Friday to July 4.

But they only started making a contribution to its upkeep in 1994, three years after the royal family took over the cost of maintenance.</p> <p>The confirmation came amid reports that the couple face losing the apartment in a review of what members of the royal family can and cannot do.</p> <p>A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: \"Obviously no member of the royal family not carrying out official duties would be allocated such a property today. They were given the apartment when circumstances were different. They make a contribution towards the cost of maintenance which is increased in line with inflation and they do pay the normal bills for services such as water and gas.\"</p> <p>Estate agents suggested to the Sunday Times that the market rate to rent such a property would currently be more like \u00a310,000 a week - three times as much as the couple pay in a year - and that they would be lucky to rent a garage in the area for the amount they pay. A rise in line with inflation this year would see them paying the equivalent of \u00a31.70 a week more.</p> <p>The apartments at the palace are in the gift of the Queen, and others are occupied by the Duke and Duchess of Kent, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, and Princess Margaret, who do carry out official duties.</p> <p>The annual cost of upkeep for the entire palace was revealed in last year's royal accounts to be \u00a31.107m. There is a staff of gardeners and cleaners, 18 craftsmen to maintain the apartments, and a 24 hour telephone exchange.</p> <p>Details of the arrangement reached by Prince Michael with his first cousin the Queen were given in a hitherto unnoticed Commons written answer by the Culture, Media and Sport Department last week.</p> <p>The answer by the junior minister, Alan Howarth, insisted that no commercial business was conducted from the couple's apartment, although it is said that the prince uses a ground-floor office in connection with a consultancy firm he runs.</p> <p>There has been speculation that Prince Michael may come under scrutiny in the current review of guidelines for the royal family's business affairs instituted under the lord chamberlain, Lord Luce, in the wake of the \"Sophiegate\" affair when the Countess of Wessex was caught by an undercover News of the World reporter talking about exploiting her royal connections for her public relations company.</p> <p>The review, which is expected to clarify the guidelines and place clearer limits on what members of the family can and cannot do, is expected to be completed within weeks.</p> <p>The palace denied any knowledge yesterday of whether Prince Michael or his wife would be interviewed by Lord Luce. The couple, who have been known to complain privately about their allegedly impoverished circumstances, have been accused of exploiting their status and connections for commercial gain.</p> <p>The prince was last month said to have taken 24 free airline trips in 15 months and to have secured VIP status in passing through airports and using their facilities. Princess Michael - known as Princess Pushy in the tabloid press - is a former interior designer.</p> <p>The couple own an eight-bedroom country mansion at Nether Lypiatt in Gloucestershire, bought for \u00a3300,000 shortly after they were first given the use of the apartment at Kensington Palace and now worth an estimated \u00a31.6m.</p>",

But they only started making a contribution to its upkeep in 1994, three years after the royal family took over the cost of maintenance. The confirmation came amid reports that the couple face losing the apartment in a review of what members of the royal family can and cannot do. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: \"Obviously no member of the royal family not carrying out official duties would be allocated such a property today. They were given the apartment when circumstances were different. They make a contribution towards the cost of maintenance which is increased in line with inflation and they do pay the normal bills for services such as water and gas.\" Estate agents suggested to the Sunday Times that the market rate to rent such a property would currently be more like \u00a310,000 a week - three times as much as the couple pay in a year - and that they would be lucky to rent a garage in the area for the amount they pay. A rise in line with inflation this year would see them paying the equivalent of \u00a31.70 a week more. The apartments at the palace are in the gift of the Queen, and others are occupied by the Duke and Duchess of Kent, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, and Princess Margaret, who do carry out official duties. The annual cost of upkeep for the entire palace was revealed in last year's royal accounts to be \u00a31.107m. There is a staff of gardeners and cleaners, 18 craftsmen to maintain the apartments, and a 24 hour telephone exchange. Details of the arrangement reached by Prince Michael with his first cousin the Queen were given in a hitherto unnoticed Commons written answer by the Culture, Media and Sport Department last week. The answer by the junior minister, Alan Howarth, insisted that no commercial business was conducted from the couple's apartment, although it is said that the prince uses a ground-floor office in connection with a consultancy firm he runs. There has been speculation that Prince Michael may come under scrutiny in the current review of guidelines for the royal family's business affairs instituted under the lord chamberlain, Lord Luce, in the wake of the \"Sophiegate\" affair when the Countess of Wessex was caught by an undercover News of the World reporter talking about exploiting her royal connections for her public relations company. The review, which is expected to clarify the guidelines and place clearer limits on what members of the family can and cannot do, is expected to be completed within weeks. The palace denied any knowledge yesterday of whether Prince Michael or his wife would be interviewed by Lord Luce. The couple, who have been known to complain privately about their allegedly impoverished circumstances, have been accused of exploiting their status and connections for commercial gain. The prince was last month said to have taken 24 free airline trips in 15 months and to have secured VIP status in passing through airports and using their facilities. Princess Michael - known as Princess Pushy in the tabloid press - is a former interior designer. The couple own an eight-bedroom country mansion at Nether Lypiatt in Gloucestershire, bought for \u00a3300,000 shortly after they were first given the use of the apartment at Kensington Palace and now worth an estimated \u00a31.6m.",

But when he died 66 days later, aged just 27, he was a Westminster MP, and the shockwaves spread around the world. More than 100,000 people came to his funeral, and now, two decades on, his long hair and pale features are among the most recognised faces of our time. Born in 1954, Sands encountered religious bigotry early in life when his family was driven out of the loyalist Rathcoole housing estate. A few years later sectarian harassment forced him to give up his first job as an apprentice coachbuilder. He joined the IRA at 18 and soon became leader of a west Belfast unit. He was jailed twice for possession of firearms, first in 1973 and again in 1977, when he was arrested after a bomb attack and gun battle at a warehouse. He and other republican prisoners took part in the blanket and \"dirty\" protests, in an attempt to get the British government to restore political status, which had been gradually phased out in the early 1970s. The ante was upped to a hunger strike in 1980 but this was called off amid confusion after a couple of months, with no deaths but no demands met. But in 1981 the prisoners decided they would have to go the distance with a second hunger strike. Brendan \"Bik\" McFarlane, head of the IRA in the Maze at the time, who first met Sands in the notorious H blocks in 1979, said: \"There was an electricity about Bobby.\" Mr McFarlane, convicted for the murder of five Protestants blown up in a bomb in a Shankill Road bar, now works for Sinn Fein Stormont assemblyman and fellow ex-prisoner, Gerry Kelly. \"Bobby was a poet, songwriter, storyteller, an all-round entertainer, but a deep thinker too.

      "bodyText": "Dissident Irish bombers could be planning a campaign designed to wreak havoc during the run-up to the general election, anti-terrorist police said yesterday. The warning came after a suspected Real IRA device exploded outside a post office sorting depot in north London, the second time the building had been targeted in three weeks. Alan Fry, the head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist branch, said contingency plans were in place to combat an election bombing campaign. Describing the task of stopping the terrorists as a \"major challenge\", Deputy Commissioner Fry said: \"We have seen sustained activity in election campaigns both in 97 and 92. We take note of that and we will be doing everything possible to secure the safety of those taking part in the election and the general public.\" Before the 1992 election the IRA warned it would force its way on to the agenda by stepping up its terror campaign on mainland Britain. As the Tories celebrated victory a bomb rocked the Baltic Exchange in the City, killing three people. In the run-up to polling day in the last election, the IRA caused massive disruption by falsely claiming it had planted devices on motorways and at airports. But it was thought that the terrorists were reluctant to endanger lives as deaths could have had an adverse impact on the chances of Sinn Fein candidates. One worry now must be that the Real IRA will not be so careful because it has no such direct aspirations to power in Westminster. The bomb at the Hendon sorting office went off at 1.40am yesterday. It had been placed at the same spot on the pavement that a similar device was detonated on April 14. Only one passerby was slightly hurt but Mr Fry said enough high explosive - half a pound - had been used to cause \"serious injuries or even death\". There was only minor damage to the building, which was empty because of the bank holiday. Though no warning was given and nobody claimed responsibility, the blast was thought to be linked to the 20th anniversary of the death of IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands.

In fact, to be fair, the sentencing review being carried out under John Halliday, a senior Home Office policy-maker, has always been due to report in May. It will be much more sophisticated than yesterday's headlines, as our home affairs editor explains today, but do not expect spin doctors to set out the complexity of dealing with crime.</p> <p>There are serious shortcomings with the present sentencing system, with too little attention paid to tackling re-offending. Supervision on release is restricted to heavy sentences; resettlement programmes, which can reduce re-offending, are extremely patchy; and there is far too little feedback to the courts about the effectiveness of different sentences. Within the system, too little progress is being made to improve literacy and numeracy skills, even though two-thirds of all inmates are ineligible for 90% of job vacancies because of inadequate skills.</p> <p>A progressive government should be seeking to create a more effective system of short-term prison sentences. But it should also be seeking to make more use of alternatives to prison. Skills-training courses are even more effective in the community than behind the prison wall. Remember the Lord Chief Justice's address to the Prison Reform Trust in February, setting out the fundamental failure of the system: overcrowding.</p> <p>Remember the chief inspector for prisons, interviewed in the Guardian in the same week, on how that challenge could be achieved: diverting 20,000 current inmates - women, boys, the elderly, the mentally ill, petty offenders - from the system. And remember the prison director's response one week later, that unless management and staff became more committed to reforming the current \"hell holes\", he would find \"an easier way of earning a living\".</p> <p>What would be desirable tomorrow - although it is not going to happen - would be a reminder by ministers of the limits of sentencing in a criminal justice system in which 98 out of every 100 crimes does not end with a conviction. Detection has always been a much bigger deterrent than length of sentence, but the clear-up rate has been going down not up.</p> <p>Contrary to Joe Public's beliefs, the government has succeeded in continuing to cut crime: a 20% fall in car crime and a 28% drop in burglary. But this drop was the result not of the tougher prison sentences endorsed by ministers, but of two other more constructive approaches. First, carefully designed crime-prevention programmes - better locks on cars and a \u00a3400m project to make 2m homes of poor and elderly people more secure. Second, true to Labour's last election mantra of being \"tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime\", its multiple anti-poverty programmes that have played their part in drastically cutting unemployment.</p> <p>What is more likely tomorrow is another depressing debate on the need for more prisons. We already send more people to prison than any other European state except Portugal. More, in fact, than the most hardline overseas regimes - Saudi Arabia, China and Burma. The prison population is already more than 50% higher than a decade ago. When will someone have the courage to say stop?</p>",

Supervision on release is restricted to heavy sentences; resettlement programmes, which can reduce re-offending, are extremely patchy; and there is far too little feedback to the courts about the effectiveness of different sentences. Within the system, too little progress is being made to improve literacy and numeracy skills, even though two-thirds of all inmates are ineligible for 90% of job vacancies because of inadequate skills. A progressive government should be seeking to create a more effective system of short-term prison sentences. But it should also be seeking to make more use of alternatives to prison. Skills-training courses are even more effective in the community than behind the prison wall. Remember the Lord Chief Justice's address to the Prison Reform Trust in February, setting out the fundamental failure of the system: overcrowding. Remember the chief inspector for prisons, interviewed in the Guardian in the same week, on how that challenge could be achieved: diverting 20,000 current inmates - women, boys, the elderly, the mentally ill, petty offenders - from the system. And remember the prison director's response one week later, that unless management and staff became more committed to reforming the current \"hell holes\", he would find \"an easier way of earning a living\". What would be desirable tomorrow - although it is not going to happen - would be a reminder by ministers of the limits of sentencing in a criminal justice system in which 98 out of every 100 crimes does not end with a conviction. Detection has always been a much bigger deterrent than length of sentence, but the clear-up rate has been going down not up. Contrary to Joe Public's beliefs, the government has succeeded in continuing to cut crime: a 20% fall in car crime and a 28% drop in burglary. But this drop was the result not of the tougher prison sentences endorsed by ministers, but of two other more constructive approaches. First, carefully designed crime-prevention programmes - better locks on cars and a \u00a3400m project to make 2m homes of poor and elderly people more secure. Second, true to Labour's last election mantra of being \"tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime\", its multiple anti-poverty programmes that have played their part in drastically cutting unemployment. What is more likely tomorrow is another depressing debate on the need for more prisons. We already send more people to prison than any other European state except Portugal. More, in fact, than the most hardline overseas regimes - Saudi Arabia, China and Burma. The prison population is already more than 50% higher than a decade ago. When will someone have the courage to say stop?",

Indeed if you are under 40 there is a good chance you do not know what it was. But in the early 1980s there really were people who conspired to take over the Labour party for Trotskyite ends, stealthily securing their majorities on the general management committees of local parties so they could send like-minded MPs to foment revolution at Westminster.</p> <p>The health secretary, Alan Milburn, was part of the \"hard left\" in those days. He had a quarrel with Militant, but as he described it to me it sounded like a quarrel about means, not ends. \"I didn't like their methods; I thought they were pretty crude and unsophisticated.\"</p> <p>Slipping into the ideological vernacular of the day, he said: \"I didn't instinctively like the making of impossibilist demands that could never be met. Some\" - this said rather defensively - \"would regard that as pragmatism, but I like to think that, coming from somewhere that had real problems, I see the need for real solutions.\"</p> <p>Somewhere in there lies the key to the journey Alan Milburn has made from revolutionary firebrand to the archetype of the New Labour manager - a cabinet minister - a journey he describes as a symbol of what has happened to his party.</p> <p>His memories of a Co Durham childhood are without any hint of the intense emotion or the delicate north-eastern light that made the film Billy Elliot blaze so brightly in our imagination (\"I went to see Billy Elliot. I thought it was fantastic, but it wasn't me.\" Why not? \"I was never interested in dance\").</p> <p>But that childhood had many of the elements that feed the southerner's stereotyping: a single mother, a town built around a long dead mine, and reflex Labour loyalties. Labour \"was in your guts and in your heart\". So far, so much standard stuff. There was a first political love affair that went wrong. Milburn was captivated by the romance of leftwing history spun in EP Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class, and began research on 18th century radicalism in the north-east.</p> <p>The PhD, at Newcastle University, ran into the ground. \"I was riveted by the idea that there was a fine tradition of radicalism in various parts of the country connected with the burgeoning of a new form of ideology, which was expressing itself in Europe with the Enlightenment, with the French revolution and in America too. But I found it pretty hard to unearth much of this in the north-east of England; sadly, there wasn't a red Tyneside to match the red Clydeside.\"</p> <p><b> Clarity</b><br></p> <p>Milburn packed it in - an early sign that he is more doer than thinker. For him the history you make matters more than the history you learn. Something odd happened to his speech patterns when he described the next phase of his life: a certain imprecision of memory that sat uneasily with the intellectual clarity of the man who had so confidently outlined his wholesale restructuring of NHS trusts the day before we talked.</p> <p>Milburn worked in Days of Hope, a leftwing bookshop in Newcastle, and he did not deny the suggestion that he had been a \"Trot\". He had been a member of the International Marxist group, the British section of Leon Trotsky's Fourth International, but he conceded that some of his political beliefs in those days were \"crackers\". He said: \"I probably thought that the best solution for any economic problem was for the state to run it.\"</p> <p>World revolution and all those other things? \"I was never that mad. I wasn't an anarchist _ I was rather more structured than that - probably. I wasn't for sort of building barricades and so on - I don't think. But I probably thought at the time that parliament was pretty much an irrelevance in terms of changing people's lives.\"</p> <p>There is one intriguing clue to the Alan Milburn of today in his account of his Days of Hope life. \"I personally developed the badge market on Tyneside,\" he said. Shortly after he left the shop it went bankrupt. \"I don't know whether that's a reflection on how I ran it or on how those who succeeded me ran it.\" Even then, competence mattered.</p> <p>The decisive moment on his road to Damascus came when, as a trade union official, he led a campaign to stop the closure of the Sunderland shipyard, announced in 1986. \"Here was a modern industrial facility with a lot going for it: a skilled workforce, hundreds of millions of pounds of investment had gone into it, lots of orders.\"</p> <p>He insisted that the decision to shut it down was made for political reasons. A deal had been done with the European commission to reduce Britain's ship building capacity, and Sunderland had to go so that the politically sensitive Harland and Woolfe in Belfast could be kept open.</p> <p>Milburn lost his battle. He is not a politician with a reputation for forging fine phrases, but his comment on the lesson he drew is often quoted: \"It taught me,\" he said, \"that life's a bitch.\"</p> <p>In fact, he learned something more profound than respect for the harsh realities of a global economy: he learned that \"political decisions matter\". If there is such a thing as Milburnism that lesson lies at its heart. He is driven by a deep conviction about the importance of the political process itself.</p> <p>It lends a puritanical cast to much of what he says; indeed puritanism is a consistent thread that links today's secretary of state with the revolutionary of two decades ago. \"The thing about that form of politics, which people who haven't been in it find difficult to understand,\" he said of his Newcastle bookshop days, \"is that it is an extremely puritanical form of leftwing politics. We believed in the cause to the detriment of any other form of life, including the wages that we were paid.\"</p> <p>Today the puritanism shows itself in the occasional flash of irritation at what he obviously sees as the fripperies of political life - including interviews like this one. Milburn runs one of the biggest public services in the world and has been talked of as a future prime minister.

He was hailed on a plane journey from the north-east by someone he had scarcely seen since they had been at school together. \"He said, 'I make pop videos for Elton John and U2 and people like that'. I said that sounds interesting. He said, 'Yes and it's very lucrative' - he'd made a fortune.\" The anecdote was told to illustrate his commitment to a way of ordering things that allows everyone to fulfil their potential. But his chuckle on the word \"lucrative\" provided a glimpse of the share option-owning chief executive he could undoubtedly have been.</p> <p>When Milburn restructured the health service last week - cutting back on bureaucrats and decentralising decision-making - the Tories accused him of stealing their clothes. I asked him to define what was distinctively Labour about the plan, and he said it was inspired by a determination to give people power over their own lives. \"I remember as a kid coming back to my house on a council estate and finding that the door was yellow, and when I'd left it in the morning it was red.

      "body": "<p>The fugitive Ronnie Biggs was last night set to fly back to Britain and to certain arrest, as scenes of farce dogged his departure from Brazil. </p> <p>A Falconer 900 EX jet hired by the Sun newspaper spent most of yesterday waiting on the tarmac at Rio de Janeiro's international airport. </p> <p>Scotland Yard said the great train robber, debilitated by three strokes and reportedly nearly penniless after more than 30 years on the run, would be arrested on arrival in Britain, expected to be today. </p> <p>The prison service has started making plans for where the 71-year-old should resume serving the remaining 28 years of his 30-year sentence, after his audacious escape in 1965 from Wandsworth prison in London. </p> <p>After numerous reports over 30 years that Biggs was on his way back, one sign that this time was genuine came when the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, intervened to ensure that the convicted crook would get an emergency passport allowing him into Britain. </p> <p>At 2pm Brazilian time two airport staff placed a wheelchair in the disabled parking space at terminal two of the airport. They said Biggs's people had asked for it to be provided. Half an hour later a dozen armed security guards appeared to clear the 50-strong British press pack from the area. Geoff Cowling, the British consul general in Rio, and Michael John Holloway, the vice-consul, were also at the airport monitoring developments. </p> <p>The Brazilian federal police said that before Biggs left he would be interviewed by officers and would have to sign a document saying he was leaving of his own free will. </p> <p>There were farcical scenes as the press descended on every taxi arriving at the airport in the vain hope that Biggs was in it, until they were told he would arrive in a white minivan. Finally the van drew up with Biggs, wearing a cowboy hat and a glazed expression, one of 20 people inside. With him was his fellow great train robber, Bruce Reynolds. </p> <p>But the minivan, sporting the logo of the Sun and a local hotel, quickly drove off as the press pack thronged around it. Later Biggs and his entourage slipped into the airport unnoticed. </p> <p>The Sun is believed to have paid \u00a360,000 for the hire of the private jet which flew to Rio to collect the fugitive for the 6,000-mile return flight to Britain. It did not comment on a report that in addition to the cost of the plane it would pay Bigg's son Michael \u00a320,000 in \"expenses\", with Bruce Reynolds and his son Nick getting \u00a312,000 each. Press complaints commission rules forbid payments to criminals. </p> <p>If the figures are correct it would mean the Sun had paid almost \u00a3100,000 for the right to say it was the paper that brought back Britain's most notorious fugitive. </p> <p>If Biggs is returned to prison straight away, it is thought likely he will be placed in a London jail. An assessment of his health needs will be made and also of the risk he poses. A police source said it was unlikely Biggs would be taken to court to face charges for escaping prison. </p> <p>Biggs has told the Sun of his desire to have a pint of beer in a Margate pub, and on board the plane was reported to be a curry and other reminders of home. </p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong></p> <p><a href=\" http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,485487,00.html\">03.05.2001: Da doo Ron Ron Ron, da doo Ron Ron...</a></p> <p><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,482380,00.html \">03.05.2001: How Biggs eluded justice for 35 years</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3951294,00.html\">16.01.2000: Sick Biggs: let me come home</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,3890933,00.html\">09.08.1999: Rogues' gallery salutes Biggs at 70</a></p> <p> <strong>Timeline</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/dome/article/0,2763,394084,00.html\">Britain's biggest robberies</a></p> <p><strong>Talk about it</strong><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee8296d/0\">Should Ronnie Biggs serve his time?</a> <strong>Photo gallery</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,485296,00.html\">The Ronnie Biggs story in pictures</a> <strong>Useful link</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.ronniebiggs.com/\">RonnieBiggs.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The fugitive Ronnie Biggs was last night set to fly back to Britain and to certain arrest, as scenes of farce dogged his departure from Brazil. A Falconer 900 EX jet hired by the Sun newspaper spent most of yesterday waiting on the tarmac at Rio de Janeiro's international airport. Scotland Yard said the great train robber, debilitated by three strokes and reportedly nearly penniless after more than 30 years on the run, would be arrested on arrival in Britain, expected to be today. The prison service has started making plans for where the 71-year-old should resume serving the remaining 28 years of his 30-year sentence, after his audacious escape in 1965 from Wandsworth prison in London. After numerous reports over 30 years that Biggs was on his way back, one sign that this time was genuine came when the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, intervened to ensure that the convicted crook would get an emergency passport allowing him into Britain. At 2pm Brazilian time two airport staff placed a wheelchair in the disabled parking space at terminal two of the airport. They said Biggs's people had asked for it to be provided. Half an hour later a dozen armed security guards appeared to clear the 50-strong British press pack from the area. Geoff Cowling, the British consul general in Rio, and Michael John Holloway, the vice-consul, were also at the airport monitoring developments. The Brazilian federal police said that before Biggs left he would be interviewed by officers and would have to sign a document saying he was leaving of his own free will. There were farcical scenes as the press descended on every taxi arriving at the airport in the vain hope that Biggs was in it, until they were told he would arrive in a white minivan. Finally the van drew up with Biggs, wearing a cowboy hat and a glazed expression, one of 20 people inside. With him was his fellow great train robber, Bruce Reynolds. But the minivan, sporting the logo of the Sun and a local hotel, quickly drove off as the press pack thronged around it. Later Biggs and his entourage slipped into the airport unnoticed. The Sun is believed to have paid \u00a360,000 for the hire of the private jet which flew to Rio to collect the fugitive for the 6,000-mile return flight to Britain. It did not comment on a report that in addition to the cost of the plane it would pay Bigg's son Michael \u00a320,000 in \"expenses\", with Bruce Reynolds and his son Nick getting \u00a312,000 each. Press complaints commission rules forbid payments to criminals. If the figures are correct it would mean the Sun had paid almost \u00a3100,000 for the right to say it was the paper that brought back Britain's most notorious fugitive. If Biggs is returned to prison straight away, it is thought likely he will be placed in a London jail. An assessment of his health needs will be made and also of the risk he poses. A police source said it was unlikely Biggs would be taken to court to face charges for escaping prison. Biggs has told the Sun of his desire to have a pint of beer in a Margate pub, and on board the plane was reported to be a curry and other reminders of home.

      "body": "<p>It is set to be an anxious few days at the Farringdon Street offices of Open, the interactive television firm. Ever since BSkyB announced its intent last July to take full control of British Interactive Broadcasting, Open's parent company, the writing has been on the wall. </p> <p>Open has 420 staff, while BSkyB has another couple of hundred working in new media. Open is based in an expensive, swanky central London location, the rest are behind barbed wire in Isleworth. With regulatory approval set to be given for BSkyB to buy its partners out, the broadcaster is planning to announce the inevitable job losses with its third quarter results on Wednesday. </p> <p>\"There was always an integration strategy in place which would naturally mean some rationalisation,\" said one BSkyB executive. </p> <p>John Florsheim, managing director of Open, is expected to move across to run a combined Sky interactive operation, neatly brushing aside BSkyB's new media chief John Swingewood, who is to be scapegoat for the broadcaster's disastrous investments in the internet. Swingewood was at home on Friday. </p> <p>It is difficult to gauge how successful Open has been. BSkyB has been reluctant to divulge figures since a triumphant press release 18 months ago said sales were running at \u00a31m in the run-up to Christmas 1999. At the time of BSkyB's interim results the company said the system had received 650,000 retail orders for its content partners including Domino's Pizza and Woolworths. </p> <p>Open racked up losses of \u00a3116m in the first six months of BSkyB's financial year and analysts expect that to reach \u00a3150m in the full year. What BSkyB doesn't break down is how much of those losses come from the operation of Open and how much is from set-top box subsidies - BiB was set up to keep the price of set-top boxes at less than \u00a3200. </p> <p>The Open brand is likely to survive in the short to medium term although the future of the stand alone \"walled garden\" shopping portal is uncertain. Rivals at the cable companies delight in telling anyone who will listen that Open is in fact closed - an inferior technology offering only a relatively small number of services within a \"walled garden\". The content partners report mixed results. \"Predicting the complete demise of Open is a little premature,\" says one source. \"But that's not to say it will be there forever and it is unlikely to be there in its existing form.\" </p> <p>There are rumours that Accenture, the management consultants used by BSkyB, told the company it needed to cut 80% of Open's staff to make it viable. </p> <p>What is more apparent is that BSkyB had little choice but to take full control of Open. It is buying out Matsushita and HSBC and is in discussions with British Telecom to acquire its 20% stake. As long as Open remained a joint venture, BSkyB was forced to adhere to a non-compete clause, which meant it could not launch interactive services across its other channels - something it needs to do as a matter of urgency. </p> <p>BSkyB is coming under intense pressure to increase revenues per subscriber. This year the company will have made revenues of some \u00a32bn but will lose around \u00a3120m at the pre-tax profit level. Marketing costs are huge in an increasingly competitive market, set-top box subsidies continue and there are fears BSkyB might need to replace them to keep up with new technological developments. </p> <p>The price of programming rights reached eye watering levels when the company agreed to pay \u00a31.1bn for three years of Premier League football, while Channel 4 pushed Friends and ER to a level even BSkyB was no longer prepared to play at. Audience shares on some of its prime channels continue to fall, with Sky One, denuded of some of its highest rating imports, dropping from 5.3% in multi-channel homes last May to 4.6% in August and just 3.7% in March. It can only be a matter of time before the slide begins to have an impact on advertising revenues. </p> <p>There is little more to be squeezed from customers in subscription revenues and interactive services are viewed as the new paradigm. BSkyB chief executive Tony Ball has agreed to pay \u00a3225m for the 20% held by HSBC and \u00a3169m for the 15% stake owned by Matsushita. Taking full control of Open also means BSkyB will bear the full brunt of subsidising set-top boxes on its own balance sheet for the first time. But it will have been deemed worth the cost. </p> <p>At the interim results in February, Ball outlined aggressive targets to increase the average revenue per subscriber from the current \u00a3286 to \u00a3400 a year by 2005. Of that increase, Ball said almost half would come from new interactive services. \"We have had a big growth period. Now we have to show where the money is,\" he added. </p> <p>Services such as email have already started to migrate from the Open channel to other parts of Sky. The Open platform is robust enough to handle e-commerce and the plan is to add an interactive element to a wide base of content. In some cases, that would redirect back to Open, in others to a tailormade site layered behind the show. Viewers will watch the Simpsons and be able to click on an icon in the corner of the screen giving them a chance to buy a Bart mug or Homer tie, Ball enthused at a recent presentation to the City. </p> <p>The latest service is Sky Movies Active which shows previews of upcoming films. Open's back end technology will allow viewers to buy CDs, videos and DVDs with BSkyB taking a cut. \"All they need to do is to get every home to spend an extra \u00a31 a week and they are starting to have a great business,\" says one analyst. </p> <p>The bigger opportunity is perceived to be for online betting. Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns a 37.5% stake in BSkyB, told a conference recently that he expected the broadcaster to generate \u00a3700m a year from online betting by 2005. Plans for Sports Active include email, shopping, betting, news and profiles appearing on a bar on screen. </p> <p>Much of the difficulty for BSkyB is that models for use of the internet and other interactive services are in a constant state of flux. </p> <p>Some of BSkyB's deals in the internet only give grist to Murdoch's cycnicism about the business model of new media. The acquisition of Sports Internet, endorsed by the BSkyB board, for more than \u00a3300m is the prime example. Analysts value the company today at little more than \u00a310m. </p> <p>Some of the early enthusiasm among investors for TV shopping has similarly waned. At the time of the deal to buy Matsushita and HSBC out of Open, some analysts were valuing the business at \u00a32.75bn because of the potential for commerce over the TV set. That valuation has also clearly moved on. </p> <p>In the meantime stripping out costs where they double up with BSkyB's existing interactive services is the obvious commercial route to take. But the uncertainties at Open have caused a growing sense of resentment. \"It's astonishing the way people at Open have been kept in the dark. They've really just been hanging on since July without knowing what would happen,\" says one former employee. Only a couple of days to go.</p>",

At the time of BSkyB's interim results the company said the system had received 650,000 retail orders for its content partners including Domino's Pizza and Woolworths. Open racked up losses of \u00a3116m in the first six months of BSkyB's financial year and analysts expect that to reach \u00a3150m in the full year. What BSkyB doesn't break down is how much of those losses come from the operation of Open and how much is from set-top box subsidies - BiB was set up to keep the price of set-top boxes at less than \u00a3200. The Open brand is likely to survive in the short to medium term although the future of the stand alone \"walled garden\" shopping portal is uncertain. Rivals at the cable companies delight in telling anyone who will listen that Open is in fact closed - an inferior technology offering only a relatively small number of services within a \"walled garden\". The content partners report mixed results. \"Predicting the complete demise of Open is a little premature,\" says one source. \"But that's not to say it will be there forever and it is unlikely to be there in its existing form.\" There are rumours that Accenture, the management consultants used by BSkyB, told the company it needed to cut 80% of Open's staff to make it viable. What is more apparent is that BSkyB had little choice but to take full control of Open. It is buying out Matsushita and HSBC and is in discussions with British Telecom to acquire its 20% stake. As long as Open remained a joint venture, BSkyB was forced to adhere to a non-compete clause, which meant it could not launch interactive services across its other channels - something it needs to do as a matter of urgency. BSkyB is coming under intense pressure to increase revenues per subscriber. This year the company will have made revenues of some \u00a32bn but will lose around \u00a3120m at the pre-tax profit level. Marketing costs are huge in an increasingly competitive market, set-top box subsidies continue and there are fears BSkyB might need to replace them to keep up with new technological developments. The price of programming rights reached eye watering levels when the company agreed to pay \u00a31.1bn for three years of Premier League football, while Channel 4 pushed Friends and ER to a level even BSkyB was no longer prepared to play at. Audience shares on some of its prime channels continue to fall, with Sky One, denuded of some of its highest rating imports, dropping from 5.3% in multi-channel homes last May to 4.6% in August and just 3.7% in March. It can only be a matter of time before the slide begins to have an impact on advertising revenues. There is little more to be squeezed from customers in subscription revenues and interactive services are viewed as the new paradigm. BSkyB chief executive Tony Ball has agreed to pay \u00a3225m for the 20% held by HSBC and \u00a3169m for the 15% stake owned by Matsushita. Taking full control of Open also means BSkyB will bear the full brunt of subsidising set-top boxes on its own balance sheet for the first time. But it will have been deemed worth the cost. At the interim results in February, Ball outlined aggressive targets to increase the average revenue per subscriber from the current \u00a3286 to \u00a3400 a year by 2005. Of that increase, Ball said almost half would come from new interactive services. \"We have had a big growth period. Now we have to show where the money is,\" he added. Services such as email have already started to migrate from the Open channel to other parts of Sky. The Open platform is robust enough to handle e-commerce and the plan is to add an interactive element to a wide base of content. In some cases, that would redirect back to Open, in others to a tailormade site layered behind the show. Viewers will watch the Simpsons and be able to click on an icon in the corner of the screen giving them a chance to buy a Bart mug or Homer tie, Ball enthused at a recent presentation to the City. The latest service is Sky Movies Active which shows previews of upcoming films. Open's back end technology will allow viewers to buy CDs, videos and DVDs with BSkyB taking a cut. \"All they need to do is to get every home to spend an extra \u00a31 a week and they are starting to have a great business,\" says one analyst. The bigger opportunity is perceived to be for online betting. Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns a 37.5% stake in BSkyB, told a conference recently that he expected the broadcaster to generate \u00a3700m a year from online betting by 2005. Plans for Sports Active include email, shopping, betting, news and profiles appearing on a bar on screen. Much of the difficulty for BSkyB is that models for use of the internet and other interactive services are in a constant state of flux. Some of BSkyB's deals in the internet only give grist to Murdoch's cycnicism about the business model of new media. The acquisition of Sports Internet, endorsed by the BSkyB board, for more than \u00a3300m is the prime example. Analysts value the company today at little more than \u00a310m. Some of the early enthusiasm among investors for TV shopping has similarly waned. At the time of the deal to buy Matsushita and HSBC out of Open, some analysts were valuing the business at \u00a32.75bn because of the potential for commerce over the TV set. That valuation has also clearly moved on. In the meantime stripping out costs where they double up with BSkyB's existing interactive services is the obvious commercial route to take. But the uncertainties at Open have caused a growing sense of resentment. \"It's astonishing the way people at Open have been kept in the dark. They've really just been hanging on since July without knowing what would happen,\" says one former employee. Only a couple of days to go.",

But a judge rejected the newspaper's claim that it had \"qualified privilege\", a form of immunity from libel actions, which we were claiming under House of Lords guidelines on the story's public importance and professional handling set out in 1998. Various issues of journalists' rights and duties, including how we publish stories based on security sources who cannot come to the witness box, are now set to be decided by higher courts. </p> <p>But the case has also raised issues of an immediately practical kind. These affect every newspaper with an internet edition. The archive section of a newspaper's website could now be open to libel actions forever, with no defence being available. </p> <p>In December 1999, Loutchansky sued the Times over two articles published in print the previous September and October. But a year later he also sued over the continued availability of the articles in the archive of the online edition of the Times. His lawyer argued that, since we had no witnesses able to testify to the truth of the disputed stories, we were not entitled to keep them on the internet edition once we had failed to mount a justification defence. </p> <p>The first question was a technical matter. A claimant suing on the \"hard copy\" does not need to prove that anyone read or saw the defamatory material. The action must, however, be brought within the limitation period of one year from the date of original publication. What about internet archive material? Would publication of such material be similarly treated? Could the publisher be sued years after the material was first posted? </p> <p>The Times argued that the courts in this country should adopt the American \"single publication\" rule.

Thus the limitation period would run out a year after the date on which the material was first posted. </p> <p>Mr Justice Gray, relying on Duke of Brunswick v Harmer (1849), ruled that the single publication rule could not be introduced in this country. He went on to rule that, provided the claimant could show that someone had read the article, he could bring an action for years to come, regardless of when the original article was posted. </p> <p>Can even defences that were available on the original day of publication be relied on later? If the original publication enjoyed qualified privilege, should subsequent publications on the internet be protected as well? The judge in our case said no. On each publication the defendants had to show that it had immunity. He rejected our contention that the archive was automatically entitled to have the original privilege. He held that the defence of qualified privilege would have to be made on each occasion that the article was read online. </p> <p> Thus, even had we won our qualified privilege, we would have lost. This decision places publishers which maintain an archive in an impossible position. If a newspaper, defending a \"hard copy\" action, failed to justify an article, or if its qualified privilege defence failed, no one would suggest it had to cut out the article from all library copies of the newspaper.

      "body": "<p>\"Either say I'm the future of British radio or slag me off.\" This parting shot neatly sums up the speech radio philosophy of Jon Gaunt, the BBC local radio breakfast show host who last week beat off competition from Radio 4 and 5 Live's finest to snatch an unprecedented three Sony Radio Academy Awards. </p> <p>Gaunty, as he is known to colleagues and listeners, is a 40-year-old working-class lad made good who's not short of an opinion or two. Nor is he afraid to share them with listeners on the BBC Three Counties Radio show he has been presenting for four years. </p> <p>\"This is my opinion - not the BBC's opinion - this is what I think,\" is his starting point, the Luton-based broadcaster says. \"Then I develop things by having guests with opposing views. It's not the kind of radio you find on Radio 4 or 5 Live, where you've got to have balance. I believe you should just open the lines, let people speak, and balance things with other callers.\" </p> <p>Gaunt is not everybody's cup of tea. His \"just talk about life and yourself\" philosophy leads to discussions about everything from his kids' nits to piles and abortion, which he is against. \"I'm not a devil's advocate. I'm not like that idiot James Whale, who takes a different stance every night.\" </p> <p>He has been up before the broadcasting standards commission five times, with three complaints upheld, including one incident when he threatened to go round to a listener's house with a baseball bat. But three separate Sony juries agreed that the Three Counties Radio coverage of Vauxhall's decision to close its Luton car factory, which he presented in December, was outstanding live radio. </p> <p>After his BBC colleague Stephen Rhodes had broken the story, on December 12, that Vauxhall was to cease car production in Luton after 95 years, Gaunt was hauled out of a panto rehearsal to present a drive time special in which the phones were thrown open to get the furious local reaction. \"I was interviewing Vauxhall UK chairman Nick Reilly and there was an electric moment when this person called in and said: 'You bastard, you betrayed us', and called him a 'Judas',\" Gaunt recalls. The next morning, Gaunt hosted his 6am breakfast show from a BBC radio van parked outside the Vauxhall factory gates. Listening to the tape of that broadcast you understand why someone who is not a national name walked off with three Sony golds. </p> <p>Live radio is a stressful business, where every bungled cue or sloppy question shows. But in the course of this lengthy show, when even regular news bulletins were dropped in favour of a huge local story, Gaunt never missed a beat. He switched between Toby Friedner and Steve Swann, two reporters mingling with the protesters, as if they were in the van with him.

      "bodyText": "\"Either say I'm the future of British radio or slag me off.\" This parting shot neatly sums up the speech radio philosophy of Jon Gaunt, the BBC local radio breakfast show host who last week beat off competition from Radio 4 and 5 Live's finest to snatch an unprecedented three Sony Radio Academy Awards. Gaunty, as he is known to colleagues and listeners, is a 40-year-old working-class lad made good who's not short of an opinion or two. Nor is he afraid to share them with listeners on the BBC Three Counties Radio show he has been presenting for four years. \"This is my opinion - not the BBC's opinion - this is what I think,\" is his starting point, the Luton-based broadcaster says. \"Then I develop things by having guests with opposing views. It's not the kind of radio you find on Radio 4 or 5 Live, where you've got to have balance. I believe you should just open the lines, let people speak, and balance things with other callers.\" Gaunt is not everybody's cup of tea. His \"just talk about life and yourself\" philosophy leads to discussions about everything from his kids' nits to piles and abortion, which he is against. \"I'm not a devil's advocate. I'm not like that idiot James Whale, who takes a different stance every night.\" He has been up before the broadcasting standards commission five times, with three complaints upheld, including one incident when he threatened to go round to a listener's house with a baseball bat. But three separate Sony juries agreed that the Three Counties Radio coverage of Vauxhall's decision to close its Luton car factory, which he presented in December, was outstanding live radio. After his BBC colleague Stephen Rhodes had broken the story, on December 12, that Vauxhall was to cease car production in Luton after 95 years, Gaunt was hauled out of a panto rehearsal to present a drive time special in which the phones were thrown open to get the furious local reaction. \"I was interviewing Vauxhall UK chairman Nick Reilly and there was an electric moment when this person called in and said: 'You bastard, you betrayed us', and called him a 'Judas',\" Gaunt recalls. The next morning, Gaunt hosted his 6am breakfast show from a BBC radio van parked outside the Vauxhall factory gates. Listening to the tape of that broadcast you understand why someone who is not a national name walked off with three Sony golds. Live radio is a stressful business, where every bungled cue or sloppy question shows. But in the course of this lengthy show, when even regular news bulletins were dropped in favour of a huge local story, Gaunt never missed a beat. He switched between Toby Friedner and Steve Swann, two reporters mingling with the protesters, as if they were in the van with him. He interviewed workers direct, handled phone-in calls and talked to Vauxhall managers. In the course of two hours, furious workers stormed Vauxhall's headquarters and demanded that Reilly address them. The programme's climax is the broadcast of this speech, heckles and all. At the Sonys last Monday, Gaunt won a gold award in the news broadcaster category, and his programme and production team picked up two more golds in the news coverage, talk and breakfast news categories. Gaunt says he is \"very grateful\" to get this industry recognition, but \"ambivalent\" about it, because \"like a lot of great journalism it's based on other people's misery\". He also reckons his broadcasting style of letting people speak meant there is a relationship with Three Counties Radio listeners that allowed him and his team to operate at the heart of the action when the Vauxhall story was breaking.

      "body": "<p>A couple of weeks ago I got ejected from a meeting of anti-capitalist group the Wombles. My opening gambit, very foolishly, was saying I worked for the Guardian. I may as well have said I worked for Special Branch. The man I approached beamed at me like a beneficent vicar presented with a pot of geraniums by an elderly lady at a flower show and muttered something incomprehensible about journalists, sacks of cement and the bottom of the river Thames. Fearing the worst, I turned to a woman for clarification. \"You're all liars,\" she said. </p> <p>Following last year's May Day demonstrations, relations between the media and the various organisations and direct action groups that make up what is broadly called the May Day coalition reached their nadir. Images on the front page of every national newspaper of Winston Churchill with his turf Mohican put paid - the protesters claimed - to any remaining illusion of pluralism in the media. From that point on, almost any attempts by the \"mainstream\" media to contact protest groups have been stonewalled. </p> <p>If you refuse to play ball with the media, can you expect to get a fair hearing? Many members of the movement argue that whatever they say to the media, the movement will be presented as a bunch of violent anarchists. Guy Taylor, of Globalise Resistance, one of the few groups who do still speak to the media, says the movement has been \"stitched up\" so many times that the majority of protesters don't bother. </p> <p>After last year's demonstrations, protest group Reclaim the Streets issued a press release in an attempt to correct what it saw as overly negative media coverage of the event. It pointed out that the media's claim that daubing the Cenotaph with graffiti was an insult to the memories of soldiers in the first world war was misplaced, given that soldiers were in open revolt against the war. </p> <p>The stance was monstered in the press - some would say predictably - and at that point many anti-capitalist groups threw in the towel and refused to have any dialogue with the media. \"It's extremely frustrating,\" says Taylor, \"to spend the whole day talking to the media about third world debt, only to find when you do get hauled in front of a camera you just get asked questions about violence.\" </p> <p>Welcome to the real world, say detractors, claiming that any organisation that becomes the subject of media attention has to learn to take the knocks. But the protesters argue that the media are now so used to being spoon-fed stories that journalists have lost the ability to seek out contacts. Emily, a protester with Reclaim the Streets, says the media's reliance on official spokespeople for a dialogue goes to the heart of the problem. \"Yes, it is hard to contact the protesters,\" she says. \"But you can do it if you want to badly enough. If journalists are saying they can't do their job because there are no spokesmen, perhaps they should be taking a closer look at how they do their jobs.\" </p> <p>Unofficially, journalists working for the main news networks say that violence is always the bottom line in coverage of protests. The BBC's head of newsgathering, Adrian Van Klaveren instructed journalists to give equal weight to the protesters' arguments. But one news producer said on the day: \"If it all goes off in central London, all the pictures of peaceful protest will go out of the window.\" ITN and Sky insiders say it's the same story there. </p> <p>Key to the protesters' strategy of circumventing the mainstream media is a proliferation of new grassroots media organisations that are supportive of the movement. One of the most striking things about the mass incarceration at Oxford Circus on May Day was the number of people carrying cameras, both stills and video. Much of the material will appear on websites such as Squall, Schnews and Indymedia, which show video and carry reports sympathetic to the protest. Protesters claim that journalists from these alternative news sources are excluded from police briefings. </p> <p>Jim Carey, who works for Squall, says that the pro-protester bias in these sites is a legitimate antidote to the negativity in the mainstream media. \"The media works properly when it's putting opposing cases to the viewer/listener as the jury,\" he says. \"But the supporters of capitalism are widespread and the opposing case is not stated. So yes, some alternative media are less pluralist than the true ideal.\" </p> <p>Globalise Resistance's Taylor agrees. \"You can't avoid the mainstream media,\" he says. \"If you've gone to the bother of seeking out the alternative voices you will already have heard the corporate media perspective, so it's not like there's a danger that it's going to be extinguished.\" </p> <p>Many of the protesters think May Day 2001 was something of a watershed in the media's attitude towards anti-capitalism protests. Although the vast majority of papers led either on violence or on the police's \"successful\" containment, there were cracks in the edifice. Reclaim the Streets' Emily said lots of the TV news bulletins - faced with little violence - were left with enduring images of overzealous police with riot shields. </p> <p>As journalist John Pilger put it: \"These demonstrations on May Day are a demonstration of the worldwide outrage at the widening gulf between the rich and the poor, euphemistically called globalisation and to simply be reporting the hype of the Metropolitan police and a few politicians climbing on to their bandwagon is unbecoming to true journalists.\" </p> <p>For many journalists the discrepancies last Tuesday between the endless cliches about violent anarchists and dogs on strings and the reality - of several thousand people from all walks of life held against their will for seven hours by riot police - must have been painfully apparent. If watching a Dalek-like policeman tell two schoolgirls that they couldn't leave the enclosure to use the toilet didn't do it, surely there's no hope for us. </p> <p><strong>The London May Day protests at a glance</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481318,00.html\">Minute-by-minute coverage of the demonstrations</a></p> <p><strong>Audio reports</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/audio2001/0501vidal.ra\">John Vidal witnesses a party atmosphere outside McDonald's in King's Cross, London (1min 45)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/audio2001/0501left.ra\">Sarah Left on the Critical Mass cycle ride (2mins)</a></p> <p><strong>Caption competition</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/graphic/0,7367,481420,00.html\">Send us a caption for this May Day picture and win a prize</a></p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,482247,00.html\">03.05.2001: Blair praises Met for control of protesters</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,482240,00.html\">03.05.2001: Mask lands accountant in court</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,482257,00.html\">03.05.2001: May Day's lessons for the rootless</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mayday/story/0,7369,482007,00.html\">02.05.2001: We're not revolting, but do we protest too much?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mayday/story/0,7369,481858,00.html\">02.05.2001: May Day clear-up begins</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481753,00.html\">02.05.2001: Police trap for protesters</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481728,00.html\">02.05.2001, comment: Why I was there</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481751,00.html\">02.05.2001: A day of skirmishes then stalemate</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481626,00.html\">02.05.2001, leader: Taking to the streets</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481660,00.html\">02.05.2001, analysis: Global's good side</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481739,00.html\">02.05.2001, comment: In place of violence</a><br></p> <p><strong>Photo galleries</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,481316,00.html\">Pictures of today's protests in London</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,481339,00.html\">Pictures of today's protests around the world</a></p> <p><strong>Interactive guide</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/flash/0,7365,477858,00.html \">Interactive guide to global protests </a><br></p> <p><strong>Maps</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/graphic/0,7367,480993,00.html\">What's happened so far</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/graphic/0,7367,481480,00.html\">What's going on in Oxford Street</a></p> <p><strong>How the Guardian is covering May Day</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481267,00.html\">01.05.2001: Keeping a level head</a></p> <p><strong>Weblog special</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weblogindex2/0,6799,475360,00.html\">May Day 2001</a></p> <p><strong>The issue explained </strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481489,00.html\">History of anti-capitalism protests</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,479726,00.html\">The May Day protests</a></p> <p><strong>Talk about it</strong><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee81d50/0\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><strong>Special reports</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/\">May Day 2001 </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/globalisation/ \">Globalisation </a></p> <p><strong>Net notes</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,214862,00.html \">May Day protests - the story in links</a></p> <p><strong>Quiz</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,480911,00.html\">What kind of May Day protester are you?</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.maydaymonopoly.net/\">May Day Monopoly</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.urban75.com/\">Urban 75 </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.wombleaction.mrnice.net/\">Womble Action </a><br><a href=\"http://uk.indymedia.org/\">Independent Media Centre</a><br><a href=\"http://www.critical-mass.org/\">Critical Mass</a><br><a href=\"http://www.reclaimthestreets.net/\">Reclaim the Streets</a><br><a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/\">Greater London Assembly</a><br><a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/\">Metropolitan police </a></p>",

It was a bit like getting a call from a complete stranger saying: \"You don't know me, but I've taken the liberty of buying you a lottery ticket. I'll let you know if you win anything ...\" </p> <p>My sitcom was called Blind Men. It was about the rivalry between two extremely competitive interior furnishings salesmen and it ran for one series on ITV. The cast were uniformly excellent, with Jeremy Swift and Sophie Thompson especially splendid, and Granada USA have used the tapes of their performances to sell the show to CBS. </p> <p>Sitcoms in the US are the big moneymakers. Once a show has played on one of the major networks for something approaching 100 episodes, it can be sold into syndication and repeated forever, at which point it is worth an absolute fortune. Seinfeld is reputed to have made no less than $1.6bn for NBC in this way. </p> <p>US television is constructed on an efficient annual cycle. The spring is pilot season, when new shows that are trying to make it on to the fall schedule are tried out. Each network makes around a dozen sitcom pilots, of which maybe three or four will be picked up in May and put into production over the summer. A successful show will run from September to March, then be repeated over the following summer, leading up to the start of a new batch the following fall. </p> <p>Three years ago Granada USA made a pilot of Blind Men for NBC, which was not picked up, although I did get the opportunity to swank about in Los Angeles pretending to be a player. The prospect of doing so again proved irresistible, so I packed a bag and flew over. </p> <p> <strong> Sunday: </strong> I have arrived in LA, but my bag hasn't. It arrives at the hotel seven hours after I do, having been found lodged on the conveyor belt behind the plastic curtain. </p> <p> <strong> Monday: </strong> I have a breakfast meeting with Bill and AJ from Granada USA. AJ has been canvassing the executives at CBS, and she is quite positive about Blind Men's chances. Of the 11 pilots commissioned by the network, apparently, only five have so far been cast, so there is a good chance of some of the competition being held over to next year. </p> <p>One of the other CBS pilots is The Kennedys, an American version of The Royle Family, also being produced by Granada USA. After breakfast Bill goes off to supervise the single-camera filming of this, which is taking place over three days, while AJ takes me to meet the Blind Men people on our set at Studio City. </p> <p>There are 20 huge sound stages on the lot at CBS Studio Center, and many of them have the logos for successful and long-running series painted large across huge double doors - Spin City, Third Rock From the Sun, Malcolm in the Middle. The streets are named after TV shows, and we drive down Gunsmoke, take a right on the Mary Tyler Moore Show, and park on the New York street set from Seinfeld. </p> <p>Rehearsals are in progress, and between scenes I meet the director, Will, a friendly veteran of Taxi and WKRP in Cincinnati, and the star, French Stewart from Third Rock. </p> <p>US TV is a notoriously ruthless environment and the lead character's wife has been recast over the weekend. When I am introduced to the new actress, who is Sherilyn Fenn from Twin Peaks, I am completely unprepared and step backwards in amazement with my mouth open. </p> <p>The writers, Andrew and Michael, who have reworked my first two episodes into their pilot script, are what is called show-runners, which means they are effectively writing and producing the show, hiring the director, the staff and the cast. They have spent four years as staff writers on Third Rock, and two on Malcolm in the Middle, but this would be their first time in charge. </p> <p>They are worried about the imminent Writers Guild of America strike, which is due to begin on May 1. If it goes ahead, then the networks may be reluctant to pick up any new shows for their fall schedule, not knowing whether they will be delivered or not. Indeed, CBS has announced that it has a contingency schedule in place, with wall-to-wall reality shows, news magazines and game shows, while NBC has threatened to go with Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, all night every night. </p> <p>Along with the power of running the show comes the hassle of dealing with the various studio and network executives, each of whom can demand changes to things he or she doesn't get. My own knowledge of what actually goes on in meetings between the writers and the network is limited. Three years ago, on the NBC pilot, I did try to sit in on a script conference, as an observer, but the head of the network pointed at me and demanded that I leave. Not least amongst the pleasures of this trip was discovering that this fellow was sacked recently, and is now unable to \"get lunch in this town\". </p> <p> <strong> Tuesday: </strong> I drive up from Santa Monica to Studio City, and sit in on the rehearsals. Today they are doing what is called \"block and shoot\". They will stage a scene for the four film cameras, and then shoot it just to have it in the can as a safety measure, in case there is a disaster on the audience night. Not that they are anticipating one, particularly, but there have been power cuts all over LA recently, and the major electricity utility has just declared itself bankrupt after dividing $50m-worth of assets among its own executives. </p> <p>I sit at the back of the audience seating for a while, goggling at the sheer opulence of the production. There is a huge fancy set for the showroom where the blinds salesmen work, another huge home set for the Stewart and Fenn characters, and round the corner a living room for a customer visit scene. </p> <p>A woman comes over and asks if I am an extra. When I say no she suddenly claps her hands to her face and squeals: \"Oh, my God! You're the creator!\" </p> <p>The cast are blocked through their moves, then allowed to retire to their dressing rooms to relax while the camera moves are plotted. Each character has a stand-in, an out-of-work actor - not exactly in short supply in LA - who takes up position with a sign around his neck saying who he's meant to be, and a sullen resentful look on his face that says: \"I could do this. I should be doing this.\" </p> <p>I watch all this going on - the budget, I'm told, is $2m, enough to make 10 Blind Men episodes in the UK. To think that if it wasn't for me none of this would be here. </p> <p>Dinner at an old friend's house, and we watch Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. They have started increasing the big prize by $10,000 every time someone fails to win it, so we are able to watch some milk-bottle-shouldered mummy's boy walk off with $2,180,000. </p> <p> <strong> Wednesday: </strong> The audience recording. It is commonplace here for a show to be recorded in front of a studio audience, which will be released at around 10.30pm. Then the network and studio executives can give their notes about things they didn't like, and the actors can be brought back for retakes, new reaction shots, new lines and even new scenes, for as long as it takes. We hear a rumour that another pilot's recording went so badly last night that the writers started completely rewriting the script at midnight, and were still taping retakes at 7am. </p> <p>By the time the audience are let in, Will has a whole non-audience version of the show in the can from yesterday and today's \"block and shoot\". During the evening he will have four film cameras recording every second, so no glances, takes, lines or looks will go astray. </p> <p>A warm-up man, from the \"What's your name, where are you from?\" school, starts to build the atmosphere, and then the show gets under way. Happily the crowd seems to get it straightaway, and it is clear that we have a very strong leading man. </p> <p>French Stewart has a way of delivering every line as though it's the finest joke he has ever heard, which is quite a knack. The announcement that he had signed to do Blind Men made the front pages of the trades, because it was the first official confirmation of the rumour that Third Rock was ending. He clearly has plenty of fans out there, and is an extremely pleasant bloke, which makes it all the more awful that I keep referring to him, inadvertently, as French Saunders. </p> <p>The recording ends more or less on time, and the warm-up man calls the cast out for a curtain call. French gets a standing ovation from the Third Rock fan club, which is nice, and then we wait for word from the executive lounge. Mercifully there are no notes from the audience at all, which is either a good sign - that the show was great - or a bad sign - that they've given up on it already. Relief and champagne all round. </p> <p> <strong> Friday: </strong> Home safely, with fingers crossed that CBS will like the pilot, and that if so, there is no writers' strike to sabotage its chances of getting on air.</p>",

He told me that the US network CBS had commissioned a pilot of an American version of a sitcom I wrote four years ago. It was a bit like getting a call from a complete stranger saying: \"You don't know me, but I've taken the liberty of buying you a lottery ticket. I'll let you know if you win anything ...\" My sitcom was called Blind Men. It was about the rivalry between two extremely competitive interior furnishings salesmen and it ran for one series on ITV.

      "body": "<p>It's strange how events justify decisions one has already made. Not long after I chose to leave the editorship of FourFourTwo magazine, one of my colleagues received a call from a marketing assistant at one of the big multinational sportswear manufacturers. FourFourTwo's profiles of young players were great, he said, and he'd love it if his company could get involved. My colleague asked how. Well, suggested the marketing monkey, what if FourFourTwo notified him whenever the magazine was to interview a player without a kit sponsorship deal? That way he could get down to the interview, give the player a pile of free branded gear to wear in the photoshoot, and slip our writer fifty quid for the favour. </p> <p>A few days later another of my colleagues took a similar call from an agent. Could we notify him if we ever interviewed any players who didn't have agents? And perhaps we could whisper his name in the player's ear? Again, there would be money in it for us. </p> <p>Both times the suggestions were refused. And although they involved an almost cartoonish level of spivvery, they both serve to illustrate the perils faced by football magazines. Both, too, made me feel I was getting out at the right time. </p> <p>For a sector that was once presumed to be a cash cow for publishers, the football titles have had a hard time of it recently. Match of the Day has now published its final issue, an outcome that was inevitable given the BBC's loss of its flagship football programme. Total Football's circulation shows no signs of approaching 30,000 and Future, its publishers, have been facing financial difficulties, so there appears little hope for greater editorial investment. The kids' titles, Match and Shoot, are dying slowly, and even the once mighty Manchester United Magazine has seen its circulation slump. </p> <p>Only two titles - IPC's World Soccer and Haymarket's FourFourTwo - have withstood the ravages of the market. </p> <p>The problems have come with increased competition from every section of the media. When FourFourTwo launched after the 1994 World Cup, the newspapers carried a fraction of the football coverage they now run, Sky Sports was still a minority interest channel and football websites were just an idea some technogeeks were kicking around. FourFourTwo, in that environment, had no difficulty attracting readers and offering them something they could not find elsewhere. </p> <p>Increased competition, however, upped the ante for magazines. If punters could read interviews with footballers on websites and in newspapers, or watch more of them on television, why would they bother reading magazines? </p> <p>At the same time, the transformation of footballers from sportsmen to celebrities was taking place. Players who were paid extraordinary amounts of money, who went to nightclubs with glamour models, who were cossetted and mollycoddled by clubs eager to hang on to their principal assets, stopped seeing the need to do anything so demeaning as talking to a magazine. </p> <p>Which was where the kit manufacturers came in. Nowadays, if a football magazine wants an interview with any reasonably big name footballer, the journalists does not phone the club. He will not even bother with the agent. He goes straight for whoever makes that player's boots. You want to interview Ryan Giggs? You phone up Reebok and ask if it can set up an interview. Yes, it will be a five-page interview, yes, you will be sending along a photographer. And when you turn up a representative of Reebok will be there, bearing armfuls of ostentatiously branded clothes for Ryan to wear. And when the feature appears in the magazine, there will be three large pictures of Ryan wearing those clothes - and the quid pro quo is that the maker's logos must be visible. </p> <p>I don't blame the kit makers. They are doing football magazines a favour. The best young footballers expect to be paid for virtually all media duties. They are not musicians with an album to promote or actors with a film to plug. They are sportsmen with little to say and even less interest in the questions being put to them. Interviews are a chore, and if there is no benefit from them, why do them? The kit makers supply the benefit by signing up players to sponsorship deals. In return for a sizable sum of money, the players make themselves available for a few days of promotional duties each year. Those duties encompass magazine interviews, product launches and the production of print and TV advertisements. </p> <p>To get the big stars, however, a magazine might have to give up more than it wants to. Maybe, in return for the star, you might have to agree to a piece with some other young no-mark whom the company sponsors. And Diadora, for example, had a brief phase of demanding layout approval, in order to ensure their logos were given due prominence. </p> <p>Even TV has suffered as the process of securing interviews has become more dependent on the middle men. Though the post-match interviews remain logo free, the one-on-one chats for BBC's Football Focus and ITV's On The Ball are often now set up by kit manufacturers. That's why you'll see players on TV with logoed baseball caps pulled low over their eyes. It's for the money, not the style. </p> <p>That, of course, creates problems for the producers. One source at BBC Sport told me he and his colleagues were well aware they were breaking all sorts of BBC rules every time they broadcast interviews set up by a kit maker, but what could they do? It was break the rules or miss the interview, and given that choice they were happy to break the rules and carry what amounts to free advertising on the BBC. </p> <p>Sports features programmes suffer the worst from the dependence on sponsors. Take Alan Hansen's various one-off shows on footballers. Did you see Football's Foreign Legion, with Leeds United's Harry Kewell wandering about in Adidas gear? Unsurprising, really, given that he was interviewed at the Adidas headquarters outside Manchester. Or perhaps you saw the trailer for Football Millionaires, which featured Andy Cole, clad head to toe in Nike kit - not his Manchester United strip - dribbling a Nike ball round some posts. That amounted to a free primetime TV ad for Nike on BBC. Which is exactly what Nike would have wanted when they agreed to supply Cole to the BBC. </p> <p>But even when the kit companies have delivered the players, agents can still almost destroy the interview. The cover story of my first edition of FourFourTwo featured Cole and Dwight Yorke together, talking about their partnership at United. Cole's agency, Paul Stretford's Pro-Active Sports Management, faxed through a form - after Nike had set up the interview - demanding copy approval. I amended the form to grant quote approval and returned it (many agents like to see quotes, not to interfere with editorial comment, but to ensure their client has not in a moment of weakness accused his club manager of being a rent boy, or a tactical halfwit). </p> <p>I heard nothing more about the request until several days after the interview had been conducted and written up, shortly before it was due to go to press, and even then the call did not come from Stretford (whose company is shortly to float on the stock market). One of FourFourTwo's Nike contacts called up, in a state of high panic, saying Stretford was furious he had not seen the full copy. Nike did not threaten the magazine. In fact, all those I spoke to at the company were desperately apologetic about the affair. But its representative made it clear Nike would greatly prefer us to send Stretford the copy, and FourFourTwo could not afford to alienate the world's most powerful sportswear manufacturer. So I swallowed my pride and phoned Pro-Active, where one of Stretford's assistants (at no point in the following days would Stretford speak to me directly) demanded the full text. Once we had sent off the copy, the demands began; and we had to accede, or lose our cover story with two days until press day and no replacement to hand. </p> <p> We were to delete all references to Cole's difficult early days at United (Andy wanted to put that behind him). We were to delete all references to the fact that successive England managers had not, in football parlance, \"fancied\" Cole (Andy wanted to put that behind him). We were to delete all references to the rough ride Cole had been given by the media (Andy wanted to put that behind him). We were even asked to change one of Dwight Yorke's quotes. Even Pro-Active were forced to accept that Yorke's agent might not be terribly happy about that. The result was a frankly unbelievable piece about St Andrew Cole of Assisi. </p> <p>Thank goodness we hadn't also written about what a surly and uncooperative interviewee Cole had been. </p> <p>There is no way out of this bind. Access to footballers and football is becoming more and more tightly controlled. Although players on their way up and on their way down are usually happy to grant interviews, those players at the zenith of their profession are now even more lofty and inaccessible than Hollywood stars (curiously, this is not the case on the continent. If you want to interview, say, Raul, you just phone up the Real Madrid press office and wait. You might have to wait a few months, but it will happen). Press officers at English clubs are no help; they see their duties as overseeing the distribution of tickets for the press box and saying no to pretty much anything else. </p> <p>Only when football catches up with the media model of American sport, where journalists are granted formalised and regular access to players, will the British sport media be able to stop giving free advertisements to the likes of Nike, Adidas, Puma, Diadora and the like. </p> <p>Sadly, our footballers are not grown up enough to let that happen. </p> <p>\u0095 Michael Hann was editor of FourFourTwo from September 1999 to March 2001</p>",

And when you turn up a representative of Reebok will be there, bearing armfuls of ostentatiously branded clothes for Ryan to wear. And when the feature appears in the magazine, there will be three large pictures of Ryan wearing those clothes - and the quid pro quo is that the maker's logos must be visible. I don't blame the kit makers. They are doing football magazines a favour. The best young footballers expect to be paid for virtually all media duties. They are not musicians with an album to promote or actors with a film to plug. They are sportsmen with little to say and even less interest in the questions being put to them. Interviews are a chore, and if there is no benefit from them, why do them? The kit makers supply the benefit by signing up players to sponsorship deals. In return for a sizable sum of money, the players make themselves available for a few days of promotional duties each year. Those duties encompass magazine interviews, product launches and the production of print and TV advertisements. To get the big stars, however, a magazine might have to give up more than it wants to. Maybe, in return for the star, you might have to agree to a piece with some other young no-mark whom the company sponsors. And Diadora, for example, had a brief phase of demanding layout approval, in order to ensure their logos were given due prominence. Even TV has suffered as the process of securing interviews has become more dependent on the middle men. Though the post-match interviews remain logo free, the one-on-one chats for BBC's Football Focus and ITV's On The Ball are often now set up by kit manufacturers. That's why you'll see players on TV with logoed baseball caps pulled low over their eyes. It's for the money, not the style. That, of course, creates problems for the producers. One source at BBC Sport told me he and his colleagues were well aware they were breaking all sorts of BBC rules every time they broadcast interviews set up by a kit maker, but what could they do? It was break the rules or miss the interview, and given that choice they were happy to break the rules and carry what amounts to free advertising on the BBC. Sports features programmes suffer the worst from the dependence on sponsors. Take Alan Hansen's various one-off shows on footballers. Did you see Football's Foreign Legion, with Leeds United's Harry Kewell wandering about in Adidas gear? Unsurprising, really, given that he was interviewed at the Adidas headquarters outside Manchester. Or perhaps you saw the trailer for Football Millionaires, which featured Andy Cole, clad head to toe in Nike kit - not his Manchester United strip - dribbling a Nike ball round some posts. That amounted to a free primetime TV ad for Nike on BBC. Which is exactly what Nike would have wanted when they agreed to supply Cole to the BBC. But even when the kit companies have delivered the players, agents can still almost destroy the interview. The cover story of my first edition of FourFourTwo featured Cole and Dwight Yorke together, talking about their partnership at United. Cole's agency, Paul Stretford's Pro-Active Sports Management, faxed through a form - after Nike had set up the interview - demanding copy approval. I amended the form to grant quote approval and returned it (many agents like to see quotes, not to interfere with editorial comment, but to ensure their client has not in a moment of weakness accused his club manager of being a rent boy, or a tactical halfwit). I heard nothing more about the request until several days after the interview had been conducted and written up, shortly before it was due to go to press, and even then the call did not come from Stretford (whose company is shortly to float on the stock market). One of FourFourTwo's Nike contacts called up, in a state of high panic, saying Stretford was furious he had not seen the full copy. Nike did not threaten the magazine. In fact, all those I spoke to at the company were desperately apologetic about the affair. But its representative made it clear Nike would greatly prefer us to send Stretford the copy, and FourFourTwo could not afford to alienate the world's most powerful sportswear manufacturer. So I swallowed my pride and phoned Pro-Active, where one of Stretford's assistants (at no point in the following days would Stretford speak to me directly) demanded the full text. Once we had sent off the copy, the demands began; and we had to accede, or lose our cover story with two days until press day and no replacement to hand. We were to delete all references to Cole's difficult early days at United (Andy wanted to put that behind him). We were to delete all references to the fact that successive England managers had not, in football parlance, \"fancied\" Cole (Andy wanted to put that behind him). We were to delete all references to the rough ride Cole had been given by the media (Andy wanted to put that behind him). We were even asked to change one of Dwight Yorke's quotes. Even Pro-Active were forced to accept that Yorke's agent might not be terribly happy about that. The result was a frankly unbelievable piece about St Andrew Cole of Assisi. Thank goodness we hadn't also written about what a surly and uncooperative interviewee Cole had been. There is no way out of this bind. Access to footballers and football is becoming more and more tightly controlled. Although players on their way up and on their way down are usually happy to grant interviews, those players at the zenith of their profession are now even more lofty and inaccessible than Hollywood stars (curiously, this is not the case on the continent. If you want to interview, say, Raul, you just phone up the Real Madrid press office and wait. You might have to wait a few months, but it will happen). Press officers at English clubs are no help; they see their duties as overseeing the distribution of tickets for the press box and saying no to pretty much anything else. Only when football catches up with the media model of American sport, where journalists are granted formalised and regular access to players, will the British sport media be able to stop giving free advertisements to the likes of Nike, Adidas, Puma, Diadora and the like. Sadly, our footballers are not grown up enough to let that happen. \u0095 Michael Hann was editor of FourFourTwo from September 1999 to March 2001",

      "body": "<p>Richard promised not to dress up as Ali G and Judy insisted she would not be investing in a wardrobe of leather, but the mere appearance of the king and queen of daytime television at Channel 4's Horseferry Road headquarters on Friday was enough to send the sales of smelling salts soaring. Never in the short history of television has there been a defection quite as dramatic as the departure of Richard and Judy from ITV. </p> <p>The husband-and-wife team have been responsible for the import of a US format that critics said would never work in Britain, turned it into a ratings-winning phenomenon, and spearheaded ITV's drive to dominate the daytime schedule with the number one show for 13 years. </p> <p>Now, with its afternoon performance in freefall and without Richard and Judy winning the morning, the prospects for ITV look bleak. </p> <p>As the news swept the industry on Friday, the enormity of the situation sank in. How had ITV and the show's producers at Granada let their two biggest live television stars slip through their fingers when the alarm bells started to ring at the beginning of the year? In February, a carefully sourced story in the Sunday People revealed that the pair were in negotiations with Sky and the BBC about a possible deal. The story was never denied, yet it seems that Granada and ITV were powerless to keep the couple. </p> <p>The Sky deal collapsed with the departure of the programming chief David Bergg - indeed, there are informed suggestions that it may even have been the cause of his departure - and the the BBC never seriously considered poaching them. </p> <p>But no one reckoned on the nuclear option, and in a clandestine week of negotiations that did not even involve the couple's agent, Madeley and Finnigan concluded a deal with Channel 4 that took their employers completely by surprise. </p> <p>In another blow for Granada and ITV, the couple confirmed at the Horseferry Road press conference that they had never even considered staying with Granada beyond the end of their contract in July. In the space of a few hours, ITV had lost the linchpin of its daytime schedule, and a frantic search for replacements began. \"It's just careless,\" said Jane Lush, the gleeful controller of daytime at the BBC. </p> <p>But while the ITV network and Granada put brave faces on their loss, recriminations began almost as soon as the announcement was made. Madeley and Finnigan publicly stated that money was not the motive for their move, so questions turned to their relationship with their bosses at ITV and Granada. Madeley denounced the stories as \"crap\", and said the couple enjoyed a close personal relationship with ITV executives such as David Liddiment. Pointedly, he did not mention the controller of daytime programmes at the network centre, Maureen Duffy. </p> <p>The leopard-print and leather wearing ex-BBC marketing executive has been causing ructions with ITV's daytime schedule since arriving last year. Focus group research showed that Loose Women, the title of ITV's daily chat show fronted by Kaye Adams, was mildly offensive to some women. Instead of sticking with the title, which matched the show's irreverent style, she decided it should be changed to the anodyne Live Talk. </p> <p>The first sign of trouble at This Morning was her insistence on a revamp of its title sequence, a move which went down badly with the presenters. She had a tough act to follow - her predecessor Dianne Nelmes was the couple's first producer and enjoyed a close working relationship with them. Whenever Madeley and Finnigan have thrown a wobbler behind the scenes - and the tales of tearful former researchers testify to a stormy history - Nelmes was always able to make peace. </p> <p>But from the moment Duffy arrived at ITV, say those close to the show, she has attempted to assert \"micro-management control.\" Madeley and Finnigan are not known to accept changes quietly: \"It has been a constant battle with Maureen,\" said one member of the programme's staff. Complaints were circulating as early as Judy's appearance at the National Television Awards - when she won the hearts of the nation all over again by revealing a rather grey M&amp;S bra underneath her glamorous halter neck gown. Behind the scenes, executives were murmuring about Duffy's insistence on researching every aspect of a 13-year-old programme with focus groups. </p> <p>Sources say she has waged a six-month campaign to split the pair up onscreen, arguing that they would be better deployed presenting the show's disparate items separately. This strategy angered many on This Morning, who believed the bickering and flirting of a married couple was the secret of their success. </p> <p>But tensions came to a head recently with This Morning's big competition. Madeley and Finnigan, who are closely involved in the development of editorial ideas for the show, had come up with the idea of offering a dream seaside retreat as a prize. Duffy disagreed, and insisted a town house in Birmingham would appeal more to the programme's viewers. The presenters, apparently, were livid. </p> <p>David Liddiment, ITV's director of programmes, was placed in an awkward situation. As a former Granada chief, he oversaw the development of the programme and was ultimately responsible for soothing the bruised egos of the high-maintenance stars. But he was also responsible for bringing Duffy to ITV, and feels a strong sense of personal loyalty to the daytime controller. </p> <p>So when he entertained Madeley and Finnigan recently, he attempted to assure them they were loved and appreciated. But Liddiment was not the problem: they were at war with Duffy and he was unable to negotiate a truce. </p> <p>Duffy had been determined to play hard ball with the pair: in talks over the renewal of Granada's contract to produce This Morning (due to start in the autumn), she refused to offer a deal for more than a year, determined to keep them under her thumb. </p> <p>Enter Amanda Ross, whose production company Cactus makes the Soap Awards for ITV, which is presented by Madeley and Finnigan. Ross had already been in discussions with Jo McGrath, Channel 4's daytime commissioner, who said she wanted to develop a new entertainment and chat programme to compete with BBC2's The Weakest Link in the early evenings. Knowing that Madeley and Finnigan were unhappy at ITV, Ross suggested the couple would be the perfect presenters. </p> <p>Unknown to ITV, Madeley and Finnigan had also taken their frustrations elsewhere: besides Sky, tentative feelers had been put out to the BBC. Chrysalis - which owns Cactus - is said to have approached Greg Dyke directly to gauge the corporation's interest in a big money transfer. Ross denies that any formal proposal was made: whatever happened, Lush passed on the pair, probably fearing a repeat of the Vanessa Feltz debacle when BBC1 found itself locked into a multi-year contract costing millions with another former ITV daytime star. </p> <p>Ross's negotiations with Channel 4 began in earnest only last Monday. Finnigan and Madeley, who net \u00a31.5m between them for their ITV show, settled on a similar fee from Channel 4 but will also receive a cut of the new show's production budget. It was a deal negotiated without their agent, Annie Sweetbaum, who was still in the south of France on Friday. </p> <p>Madeley and Finnigan appeared in the office of Grant Mansfield, Granada's director of programmes, on Friday morning to break the news. Granada Media chairman Charles Allen, chief executive Steve Morrison and programme editor Karen Smith received faxes. Finnigan became emotional in Mansfield's office and began to cry. \"Do you think we're doing the right thing?\" she asked him. Mansfield's reply goes unrecorded. </p> <p>Channel 4 insists that Madeley and Finnigan are the right choice for the channel. There is speculation that they want to boost their troublesome 5pm slot, which is performing dismally against Ready, Steady, Cook and the Weakest Link on BBC2.

      "bodyText": "Richard promised not to dress up as Ali G and Judy insisted she would not be investing in a wardrobe of leather, but the mere appearance of the king and queen of daytime television at Channel 4's Horseferry Road headquarters on Friday was enough to send the sales of smelling salts soaring. Never in the short history of television has there been a defection quite as dramatic as the departure of Richard and Judy from ITV. The husband-and-wife team have been responsible for the import of a US format that critics said would never work in Britain, turned it into a ratings-winning phenomenon, and spearheaded ITV's drive to dominate the daytime schedule with the number one show for 13 years. Now, with its afternoon performance in freefall and without Richard and Judy winning the morning, the prospects for ITV look bleak. As the news swept the industry on Friday, the enormity of the situation sank in. How had ITV and the show's producers at Granada let their two biggest live television stars slip through their fingers when the alarm bells started to ring at the beginning of the year? In February, a carefully sourced story in the Sunday People revealed that the pair were in negotiations with Sky and the BBC about a possible deal. The story was never denied, yet it seems that Granada and ITV were powerless to keep the couple. The Sky deal collapsed with the departure of the programming chief David Bergg - indeed, there are informed suggestions that it may even have been the cause of his departure - and the the BBC never seriously considered poaching them. But no one reckoned on the nuclear option, and in a clandestine week of negotiations that did not even involve the couple's agent, Madeley and Finnigan concluded a deal with Channel 4 that took their employers completely by surprise. In another blow for Granada and ITV, the couple confirmed at the Horseferry Road press conference that they had never even considered staying with Granada beyond the end of their contract in July. In the space of a few hours, ITV had lost the linchpin of its daytime schedule, and a frantic search for replacements began. \"It's just careless,\" said Jane Lush, the gleeful controller of daytime at the BBC. But while the ITV network and Granada put brave faces on their loss, recriminations began almost as soon as the announcement was made. Madeley and Finnigan publicly stated that money was not the motive for their move, so questions turned to their relationship with their bosses at ITV and Granada. Madeley denounced the stories as \"crap\", and said the couple enjoyed a close personal relationship with ITV executives such as David Liddiment. Pointedly, he did not mention the controller of daytime programmes at the network centre, Maureen Duffy. The leopard-print and leather wearing ex-BBC marketing executive has been causing ructions with ITV's daytime schedule since arriving last year. Focus group research showed that Loose Women, the title of ITV's daily chat show fronted by Kaye Adams, was mildly offensive to some women. Instead of sticking with the title, which matched the show's irreverent style, she decided it should be changed to the anodyne Live Talk. The first sign of trouble at This Morning was her insistence on a revamp of its title sequence, a move which went down badly with the presenters. She had a tough act to follow - her predecessor Dianne Nelmes was the couple's first producer and enjoyed a close working relationship with them. Whenever Madeley and Finnigan have thrown a wobbler behind the scenes - and the tales of tearful former researchers testify to a stormy history - Nelmes was always able to make peace. But from the moment Duffy arrived at ITV, say those close to the show, she has attempted to assert \"micro-management control.\" Madeley and Finnigan are not known to accept changes quietly: \"It has been a constant battle with Maureen,\" said one member of the programme's staff. Complaints were circulating as early as Judy's appearance at the National Television Awards - when she won the hearts of the nation all over again by revealing a rather grey M&amp;S bra underneath her glamorous halter neck gown. Behind the scenes, executives were murmuring about Duffy's insistence on researching every aspect of a 13-year-old programme with focus groups. Sources say she has waged a six-month campaign to split the pair up onscreen, arguing that they would be better deployed presenting the show's disparate items separately. This strategy angered many on This Morning, who believed the bickering and flirting of a married couple was the secret of their success. But tensions came to a head recently with This Morning's big competition. Madeley and Finnigan, who are closely involved in the development of editorial ideas for the show, had come up with the idea of offering a dream seaside retreat as a prize. Duffy disagreed, and insisted a town house in Birmingham would appeal more to the programme's viewers. The presenters, apparently, were livid. David Liddiment, ITV's director of programmes, was placed in an awkward situation. As a former Granada chief, he oversaw the development of the programme and was ultimately responsible for soothing the bruised egos of the high-maintenance stars. But he was also responsible for bringing Duffy to ITV, and feels a strong sense of personal loyalty to the daytime controller. So when he entertained Madeley and Finnigan recently, he attempted to assure them they were loved and appreciated. But Liddiment was not the problem: they were at war with Duffy and he was unable to negotiate a truce. Duffy had been determined to play hard ball with the pair: in talks over the renewal of Granada's contract to produce This Morning (due to start in the autumn), she refused to offer a deal for more than a year, determined to keep them under her thumb. Enter Amanda Ross, whose production company Cactus makes the Soap Awards for ITV, which is presented by Madeley and Finnigan. Ross had already been in discussions with Jo McGrath, Channel 4's daytime commissioner, who said she wanted to develop a new entertainment and chat programme to compete with BBC2's The Weakest Link in the early evenings. Knowing that Madeley and Finnigan were unhappy at ITV, Ross suggested the couple would be the perfect presenters. Unknown to ITV, Madeley and Finnigan had also taken their frustrations elsewhere: besides Sky, tentative feelers had been put out to the BBC. Chrysalis - which owns Cactus - is said to have approached Greg Dyke directly to gauge the corporation's interest in a big money transfer. Ross denies that any formal proposal was made: whatever happened, Lush passed on the pair, probably fearing a repeat of the Vanessa Feltz debacle when BBC1 found itself locked into a multi-year contract costing millions with another former ITV daytime star. Ross's negotiations with Channel 4 began in earnest only last Monday. Finnigan and Madeley, who net \u00a31.5m between them for their ITV show, settled on a similar fee from Channel 4 but will also receive a cut of the new show's production budget. It was a deal negotiated without their agent, Annie Sweetbaum, who was still in the south of France on Friday. Madeley and Finnigan appeared in the office of Grant Mansfield, Granada's director of programmes, on Friday morning to break the news. Granada Media chairman Charles Allen, chief executive Steve Morrison and programme editor Karen Smith received faxes. Finnigan became emotional in Mansfield's office and began to cry. \"Do you think we're doing the right thing?\" she asked him. Mansfield's reply goes unrecorded. Channel 4 insists that Madeley and Finnigan are the right choice for the channel. There is speculation that they want to boost their troublesome 5pm slot, which is performing dismally against Ready, Steady, Cook and the Weakest Link on BBC2. But Lush believes her Channel 4 counterpart, Jo McGrath, has made a big mistake. \"I'm not surprised that Richard and Judy have left ITV, but I am astonished that Channel 4 thought they were an appropriate booking,\" she said. For Granada, the loss of Richard and Judy is far more significant than the end of a 13-year relationship. Along with Coronation Street, This Morning is a company flagship. A two-hour programme, five days a week which has consistently won its slot for over a decade is a huge business in itself - the contract is worth \u00a38m a year to the company. ITV sources suggest that Duffy rang Granada on Friday to assure the nervous executives that This Morning had been recomissioned for the year through to 2002. But she and Liddiment have not yet discussed the long-term future of the programme. \"It seems impossible that This Morning can survive without Richard and Judy,\" said a senior ITV source on Friday. \"So the slot might have to be put out to tender.

      "body": "<p>If it wasn't for the racetrack, Interlagos would just be another run down, dangerous suburb in Sao Paolo. </p> <p>It's here that David Coulthard recently stole formula one victory, though the course is apparently unpopular with drivers, worried about the city's reputation for violence. </p> <p>Tonight the fast engines have been usurped by the high-speed rhythms of electronic dance music for Skol Beats, a touring dance party that climaxes here after two nights in Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro. </p> <p>Half a dozen marquees are packed with 20,000 or so people. Sub-genres such as trance and house get a big tent each and are jammed with white partygoers from Sao Paolo's significant middle class. </p> <p>But in a huge tent hosted by the London club Movement, it's a different story. Here the faces are mostly brown and black, the clothes a clash of baggy hip-hop gear and futuristic ghetto chic, the music the rapid-fire rhythms and subsonic basslines of London-style drum'n'bass. Sporting Day-Glo dyed hair teased into sci-fi mohawks, pierced faces and flashing neon bracelets, these are the cyberpunks, a clean-living drum'n'bass clan from Sao Paolo's poorest suburbs. \"This is a totally local movement,\" says writer and clubber Henrique Cury. \"There's nothing like this in Rio.\"</p> <p>Some of the crowd form circles so those skilful enough can dance in the middle, using a combination of moves from breakdancing, jazz and samba. Marcio takes his turn for a lewd courtship routine with a girl. He's on his knees, thrusting. The girl throws a handstand, brushes him dramatically off her hands and struts away. </p> <p>Adelson is next, flinging his body through contortions. Where European audiences prefer to sway with drum'n'bass, the cyberpunks blur as they keep time with its 160-beats-per-minute drums. </p> <p>\"It's sort of a competition,\" explains Marcio, 21, grabbing a breather. He works in one of Sao Paolo's street markets. \"A street dance,\" adds Adelson, who folds newspapers for a living. Both come from Suzano, a particularly rough southside suburb. </p> <p>As the ferocious rhythms subside, a rolling breakbeat anthem that's half samba, half drum'n'bass, bristling with guitar licks and Portuguese chorus, crashes in. The crowd roar. The record, Sambassim, is a collaboration between the Sao Paolo DJ Patife and the Brazilian singer and composer Fernanda Porto. It's one of seven such tracks on the Brasil EP, just released by V Recordings and already causing a commotion on the London drum'n'bass scene, where Patife and his DJ partner Marky Mark have become stars.</p> <p>According to the veteran DJ Bryan Gee, who runs London's V Recordings: \"They've managed to capture the sound of Brazil, the sunshine, without making it too cheesy. This is the next sound for drum'n' bass. We're used to Brazilian footballers and supermodels. It's time to get ready for the first Brazilian DJ stars.\"</p> <p>In the past decade acid house has flamed across the planet, but has remained under the control of European and American DJs and producers, with the rest of the world content to ape western clubs and import star DJs. South America is the last frontier for dance music and a key destination for British DJs, with Uruguay's swanky Punta Del Este resort touted as the \"new Ibiza\". </p> <p>But the club scene here remains largely the preserve of the young middle classes. In Sao Paolo, though, hardnosed American techno first earned a fanatical following in the deprived suburbs, followed by drum'n'bass, mainly through the efforts of local boys such as Marky Mark (no relation to the Hollywood actor Mark Wahlberg's former rapper pseudonym). \"People from high society, they don't go to watch drum'n'bass,\" says Marcio. His words are echoed by Ramilson Maia, leader of local drum'n'bass act Ram Science, who have just performed in the Movement marquee. \"The cyberpunks are discriminated against. They're from the suburbs, they don't have much money and they don't take so many drugs as the trance people, because they can't afford it. It's about the music for them.\" </p> <p>Max de Castro is a singer and multi-instrumentalist who collaborates on the Brasil EP. \"I think the drum'n'bass beats sound like accelerated samba,\" he says. \"If you start slowing down the beats, you get closer to bossa nova.\" There are social links, too, between drum'n'bass, born in London's inner-city council estates from a fusion of European hardcore techno, dub reggae and hip-hop, and samba - a combination of African drums, Cuban rhythms and European polka. </p> <p>One of the first Brazilian musicians to combine syncopated African rhythms with European influences was the mulatta (mixed-race) Francisca \"Chiquinha\" Hedviges Ganzaga de Amaral, who struggled against all kinds of prejudice. As Gee explains, \"This music comes from the underground and the underground is always found in the ghetto.\"</p> <p>When Mark first appeared at Movement in London in 1998, his scratching abilities with high-speed drum'n'bass beats astounded people. He DJed like Brazilians play football. \"Marky has made a big impact,\" says Gee. \"He's brought a different attitude. DJs like me just go to the decks, cigarette in mouth. Marky is smiling, he's scratching.\" </p> <p>The son of a jazz-loving policeman, Mark, 27, is a pioneer for drum'n'bass in Brazil - along with DJ Xerxes, the first producer to use samba licks. His father would have preferred it if he'd joined the police: \"He's a little bit rude about it.\" Mark spent the 1990s building a reputation as Sao Paolo's leading hardcore and drum'n'bass DJ, working in a shop, DJing at a club and now hosting his own radio show.</p> <p>For Patife, 24, DJing was an escape route from poverty. His wiry frame and rapper-style headscarf stand out in the smart restaurant where we all meet. When he grins, he reveals big braces on his teeth. He comes from one of Sao Paolo's roughest districts, Cidade A Demar. </p> <p>His parents split when he was young; his mother now works as a cleaner at a tyre factory for \u00a365 a month. Patife went to his first club when he was 11. \"I started to work in pizza delivery, and all the money I got, I saved. When I was 13 I bought my first deck. Shit deck.\" In 1993, he went to a city centre record store where Mark wowed him with early jungle records. \"I like the broken beats,\" he says, clicking out a rhythm with his tongue.</p> <p>Patife and Mark first came to London in 1997. \"It's my first time in London, and me and Patife see Goldie on the street,\" remembers Marky. \"We say, 'Goldie! Goldie! Brazilians!' \" Goldie gave them passes to his club Metalheadz, and they also went to Movement. Patife later borrowed the money to fly back to London with videos of their parties, records and flyers to convince Movement to let them franchise its name in Sao Paolo. Edo Van Dyne of Movement flew over to check it out and Mark got a contract straight away.</p> <p>The release of the Brasil EP is going to up the stakes for Mark and Patife in both London and Sao Paolo. Tracks like the punishingly rhythmic Pra Voce Lembrar from Patife and De Castro take this fusion of urban samba and London jungle into new musical arenas. \"It's a fresh flavour,\" says Mark. \"New beats. It's cool.\" </p> <p>De Castro is the son of Wilson Simonal, a famous Brazilian crooner of the 1970s, but with his loud shades, dreadlocks and diffident cool, he's clearly not following in his father's footsteps. Last year he released the Samba Raro album on the Trama label which won a critic's prize. \"Mixing modern concepts with the best of Brazilian traditional music,\" he says. De Castro heard drum'n'bass some years ago and sought out DJs such as Mark in the rougher suburban clubs. Porto, 32, comes from the mainstream background of Brazilian popular music. </p> <p>Classically trained, with a career that encompasses opera, writing soundtracks and playing violin, she first heard drum'n'bass in 1997 and was impressed enough to spend six weeks in London hanging out at drum'n'bass clubs. With her credentials, she is lifting drum'n'bass above the prejudice of the Brazilian critical establishment. \"There's no reason why people shouldn't go for drum'n'bass. </p> <p>It can be totally adapted for our culture,\" she says. In Sambassim, there's even a rare existential moment for drum'n'bass as she sings: \"Is this really samba? Yes it is.\"</p> <p>This couldn't have come at a better time for drum'n'bass. Five years ago, jungle, as it was called then, flamed into the mainstream, even hooking in stars such as David Bowie. But its thunder - and, importantly, its female audience - was stolen by the more melodic UK garage scene and drum'n'bass took a sullenly noisy direction. As Gee puts it, \"The sex had gone out of the music, the feel-good. It did go up its own arse and get a bit nasty. Even my girlfriend wanted to go to garage parties.\"</p> <p>Now Patife and Mark are part of a melodic new direction for the music.</p> <p>Gee wanders back into the Movement tent, half bottle of Baileys in hand. Patife is on stage DJing, whipping the cyberpunks into a frenzy. Down in the throng, Marcio and Adelson are still dancing. Maybe playing records will join football as an escape strategy from Brazilian poverty. If not, there's always five minutes of glory in the circle. \"When you are dancing, people are clapping, it's great,\" says Marcio. \"We can feel like a DJ.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Brasil EP is out now on V Recordings.</p>",

It's time to get ready for the first Brazilian DJ stars.\" In the past decade acid house has flamed across the planet, but has remained under the control of European and American DJs and producers, with the rest of the world content to ape western clubs and import star DJs. South America is the last frontier for dance music and a key destination for British DJs, with Uruguay's swanky Punta Del Este resort touted as the \"new Ibiza\". But the club scene here remains largely the preserve of the young middle classes. In Sao Paolo, though, hardnosed American techno first earned a fanatical following in the deprived suburbs, followed by drum'n'bass, mainly through the efforts of local boys such as Marky Mark (no relation to the Hollywood actor Mark Wahlberg's former rapper pseudonym). \"People from high society, they don't go to watch drum'n'bass,\" says Marcio. His words are echoed by Ramilson Maia, leader of local drum'n'bass act Ram Science, who have just performed in the Movement marquee. \"The cyberpunks are discriminated against. They're from the suburbs, they don't have much money and they don't take so many drugs as the trance people, because they can't afford it. It's about the music for them.\" Max de Castro is a singer and multi-instrumentalist who collaborates on the Brasil EP. \"I think the drum'n'bass beats sound like accelerated samba,\" he says. \"If you start slowing down the beats, you get closer to bossa nova.\" There are social links, too, between drum'n'bass, born in London's inner-city council estates from a fusion of European hardcore techno, dub reggae and hip-hop, and samba - a combination of African drums, Cuban rhythms and European polka. One of the first Brazilian musicians to combine syncopated African rhythms with European influences was the mulatta (mixed-race) Francisca \"Chiquinha\" Hedviges Ganzaga de Amaral, who struggled against all kinds of prejudice. As Gee explains, \"This music comes from the underground and the underground is always found in the ghetto.\" When Mark first appeared at Movement in London in 1998, his scratching abilities with high-speed drum'n'bass beats astounded people. He DJed like Brazilians play football. \"Marky has made a big impact,\" says Gee. \"He's brought a different attitude. DJs like me just go to the decks, cigarette in mouth. Marky is smiling, he's scratching.\" The son of a jazz-loving policeman, Mark, 27, is a pioneer for drum'n'bass in Brazil - along with DJ Xerxes, the first producer to use samba licks. His father would have preferred it if he'd joined the police: \"He's a little bit rude about it.\" Mark spent the 1990s building a reputation as Sao Paolo's leading hardcore and drum'n'bass DJ, working in a shop, DJing at a club and now hosting his own radio show. For Patife, 24, DJing was an escape route from poverty. His wiry frame and rapper-style headscarf stand out in the smart restaurant where we all meet. When he grins, he reveals big braces on his teeth. He comes from one of Sao Paolo's roughest districts, Cidade A Demar. His parents split when he was young; his mother now works as a cleaner at a tyre factory for \u00a365 a month. Patife went to his first club when he was 11. \"I started to work in pizza delivery, and all the money I got, I saved. When I was 13 I bought my first deck. Shit deck.\" In 1993, he went to a city centre record store where Mark wowed him with early jungle records. \"I like the broken beats,\" he says, clicking out a rhythm with his tongue. Patife and Mark first came to London in 1997. \"It's my first time in London, and me and Patife see Goldie on the street,\" remembers Marky. \"We say, 'Goldie! Goldie! Brazilians!' \" Goldie gave them passes to his club Metalheadz, and they also went to Movement. Patife later borrowed the money to fly back to London with videos of their parties, records and flyers to convince Movement to let them franchise its name in Sao Paolo. Edo Van Dyne of Movement flew over to check it out and Mark got a contract straight away. The release of the Brasil EP is going to up the stakes for Mark and Patife in both London and Sao Paolo. Tracks like the punishingly rhythmic Pra Voce Lembrar from Patife and De Castro take this fusion of urban samba and London jungle into new musical arenas. \"It's a fresh flavour,\" says Mark. \"New beats. It's cool.\" De Castro is the son of Wilson Simonal, a famous Brazilian crooner of the 1970s, but with his loud shades, dreadlocks and diffident cool, he's clearly not following in his father's footsteps. Last year he released the Samba Raro album on the Trama label which won a critic's prize. \"Mixing modern concepts with the best of Brazilian traditional music,\" he says. De Castro heard drum'n'bass some years ago and sought out DJs such as Mark in the rougher suburban clubs. Porto, 32, comes from the mainstream background of Brazilian popular music. Classically trained, with a career that encompasses opera, writing soundtracks and playing violin, she first heard drum'n'bass in 1997 and was impressed enough to spend six weeks in London hanging out at drum'n'bass clubs. With her credentials, she is lifting drum'n'bass above the prejudice of the Brazilian critical establishment. \"There's no reason why people shouldn't go for drum'n'bass. It can be totally adapted for our culture,\" she says. In Sambassim, there's even a rare existential moment for drum'n'bass as she sings: \"Is this really samba? Yes it is.\" This couldn't have come at a better time for drum'n'bass. Five years ago, jungle, as it was called then, flamed into the mainstream, even hooking in stars such as David Bowie. But its thunder - and, importantly, its female audience - was stolen by the more melodic UK garage scene and drum'n'bass took a sullenly noisy direction. As Gee puts it, \"The sex had gone out of the music, the feel-good. It did go up its own arse and get a bit nasty. Even my girlfriend wanted to go to garage parties.\" Now Patife and Mark are part of a melodic new direction for the music. Gee wanders back into the Movement tent, half bottle of Baileys in hand. Patife is on stage DJing, whipping the cyberpunks into a frenzy. Down in the throng, Marcio and Adelson are still dancing. Maybe playing records will join football as an escape strategy from Brazilian poverty. If not, there's always five minutes of glory in the circle. \"When you are dancing, people are clapping, it's great,\" says Marcio. \"We can feel like a DJ.\" \u0095 The Brasil EP is out now on V Recordings.",

From 1997 to 2000, the economy grew 2.8% a year on average, slightly above Britain's long-term average. The Conservatives argue that the robust expansion in 1997 was the legacy of their government, and there is some truth in this. On that basis, growth was 2.6% in the three years when Labour's decisions counted. How does that compare with John Major's administration? Badly, say the Tories, because from 1993 to 1997 growth averaged 3.1% a year. But the Conservatives' growth record looks less good when 1992 (the first year of the 1992-7 parliament) is included, as it should be. The economy grew 0.1% in 1992, so the average for 1992-97 is 2.6%, the same as Labour's in the past three years. Moreover, the deep recession of the early 1990s meant the economy had oodles of spare capacity, allowing for rapid growth and rapidly falling unemployment without inflationary pressure. </p> <p>Labour's record on inflation is good. Measured by the retail prices index excluding mortgages, it is down from 2.8% in May 1997 to 2.1% in 2000, while using the the harmonised index to compare different countries, Britain has the low est inflation rate in Europe. Much will be made of this over the coming weeks, particularly since the expectation that inflation will remain low has driven down long-term interest rates, so that borrowers in Britain are no longer at a disadvantage compared to borrowers in the rest of Europe. When Labour came to power, long-term interest rates were 7% in Britain and 6% in the countries that now make up the eurozone. Last year, the rates were identical at 5.5%. Where the Conservatives do have a point is with their argument that real interest rates - nominal interest rates minus inflation - are higher not lower than they were in the mid-1990s. </p> <p>The Tories are also right to say that the tax burden is higher now than it was in 1997, but real incomes have been rising, consumer confidence is relatively strong, house prices are going up. The economy is now slowing down pretty rapidly and the data over the next few months - affected by the travails of the US and foot and mouth - will be weak. Even so, Labour will have a second term to deal with some of the problems left over from the first. </p> <p>One of these is Britain's poor productivity record, explored elsewhere in this section. The real time bomb is the increasingly lopsided state of the economy, with boom in some protected domestic sectors and impending bust in the bits that trade. The chart shows that the problem stems from Britain's over-valued real exchange rate, which adjusts for changes in relative unit labour costs between countries. The exchange rate has been higher for longer than it was during the manufacturing slump of the early 1980s, and what's surprising is not that some parts of industry have been suffering, but that the distress has not been greater. </p> <p>It may be that industry has been transformed over the past two decades, making it more resilient, and the fact that Britain is increasing its market share of European inward investment suggests that the UK is seen as a good place to do business. Alternatively, it could be the underlying problems caused by the exchange rate have been masked by the buoyancy of global demand and will surface as a result of the global economic slowdown. Already, Britain is losing market share of global exports. </p> <p>It is tempting at this juncture to point to Germany as a country that has survived and thrived despite having a high real exchange rate, but Germany's sluggish record of the past decade suggests that sooner or later even the most efficient of economies can be hobbled by an overvalued currency, a weakness exacerbated by joining the euro at a rate 20% too high against the French franc. </p> <p>Britain's recent experience mirrors that of the US. Optimism about the UK meant capital flowed into the country, boosting sterling. A high pound depressed inflation, even at a time of robust domestic demand, leading to lower interest rates. Cheaper money boosted growth prospects, which attracted even more capital. And so it goes on. </p> <p><strong>Warning signs</strong></p> <p> The current account is already flashing warnings signals, though it is something of a paradox that the overvaluation of sterling has been greatest against the euro, while the deterioration in the trade figures has been most pronounced against non-EU countries.

At some stage, the Bank will be proved right and sterling will fall so that the current account deficit can be reduced. The longer this process is delayed the more painful the adjustment will be.

whose tourist trade has already been seriously hit by restrictions imposed because of the disease - could be further devastated by the epidemic. \"Every farmer on the moor is living in fear,\" said Oliver Edwards, chairman of Somerset National Farmers' Union, who farms in the centre of the moor.</p> <p>\"We thought that with the restrictions being lifted in Somerset the other day we were seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, so this has been a real blow.\"</p> <p>A restaurateur, Judy Carless, who recently criticised Tony Blair on a visit to Exmoor for his handling of the crisis and has set up the pressure group Living Exmoor, added: \"We had just started reopening roads when this infection came along, and now all the signs have gone up telling people to stay away.</p> <p>\"Everybody is so terrified of what could happen if it reaches open moor.\"</p> <p>Elsewhere in Britain, sunshine and mild temperatures brought visitors flocking to areas previously shunned because of the disease.</p> <p>People headed for the North Yorkshire moors, despite footpaths being closed, while the Yorkshire Dales and Northumberland national park also proved popular.</p> <p>A spokesman for North Yorkshire moors national park, Mike Pratt, said: \"Before this weekend, due to the foot and mouth problems, our visitor numbers were down by about half, but over this weekend it seems as if they are pretty much back to normal.</p> <p>Ian Stewart, a spokesman for Northumberland national park, said: \"The weather has been beautiful, and visitors levels are running at 70% of what they were -

Almost 1,000 cattle on a connected group of farms in Dulverton, within the national park, face slaughter after Maff officials found that they were visited by a farmer at the centre of an outbreak in Wiveliscombe, Somerset, some 15 miles away. More than a dozen other premises visited by the farmer, Rob Norman, in the past fortnight have also been traced, and some 5,000 livestock are being slaughtered or facing slaughter.

      "body": "<p>The Post Office last night threatened to remove first class mail from rail and put it on the roads or even in the air because of a failure by the rail industry to help deliver millions of first class letters on time.</p> <p>The PO said it would take action unless the situation dramatically improved. Most of the 8m first class letters carried by rail each day are \"catastrophically late\" and there is little sign of improvement.</p> <p>The PO said it was in discussions with English, Welsh and Scottish (EWS), the rail freight company which carries the mail, to see what improvements could be made. Of the 59 mail trains which operate each night, 20 or more are running 30 minutes late and miss vital connections with delivery vans for onward transmission to sorting centres.</p> <p>The PO is under pressure from the industry regulator to improve first class mail deliveries. Last year it only achieved an 89.1% success rate and this year it has been instructed by the regulator to raise its performance to 92.1% or face financial penalties.</p> <p>Yesterday the PO said: \"This situation cannot go on indefinitely.\" It relies heavily on rail for its rail deliveries and its \u00a350m contract with EWS is one of the most lucrative for the freight company, which is losing millions of pounds a year.</p> <p>A spokesman for the PO, which has assumed the global name of Consignia, said EWS had consistently defaulted on its contract, which has a further five years to run. The PO could have taken legal action against EWS but has so far refrained from doing so.</p> <p>The position has been made worse by the impact of the Hatfield rail crash in October last year. The crash paralysed the industry, which has still not fully recovered, but the effect on postal efficiency has been particularly severe.</p> <p>Even in the 10 months before Hatfield, according to the PO, 95% of its mail trains were running late. Although there has been some improvement in the past few months, its services are still poor.</p> <p>Its relationship with Railtrack is only beginning to heal after a clash at Christmas when Railtrack announced a closure of part of the network for signalling improvements. This was done without any consultation with the PO, whose services could have been severely restricted for 10 days.

      "bodyText": "The Post Office last night threatened to remove first class mail from rail and put it on the roads or even in the air because of a failure by the rail industry to help deliver millions of first class letters on time. The PO said it would take action unless the situation dramatically improved. Most of the 8m first class letters carried by rail each day are \"catastrophically late\" and there is little sign of improvement. The PO said it was in discussions with English, Welsh and Scottish (EWS), the rail freight company which carries the mail, to see what improvements could be made. Of the 59 mail trains which operate each night, 20 or more are running 30 minutes late and miss vital connections with delivery vans for onward transmission to sorting centres. The PO is under pressure from the industry regulator to improve first class mail deliveries. Last year it only achieved an 89.1% success rate and this year it has been instructed by the regulator to raise its performance to 92.1% or face financial penalties. Yesterday the PO said: \"This situation cannot go on indefinitely.\" It relies heavily on rail for its rail deliveries and its \u00a350m contract with EWS is one of the most lucrative for the freight company, which is losing millions of pounds a year. A spokesman for the PO, which has assumed the global name of Consignia, said EWS had consistently defaulted on its contract, which has a further five years to run. The PO could have taken legal action against EWS but has so far refrained from doing so. The position has been made worse by the impact of the Hatfield rail crash in October last year. The crash paralysed the industry, which has still not fully recovered, but the effect on postal efficiency has been particularly severe. Even in the 10 months before Hatfield, according to the PO, 95% of its mail trains were running late. Although there has been some improvement in the past few months, its services are still poor. Its relationship with Railtrack is only beginning to heal after a clash at Christmas when Railtrack announced a closure of part of the network for signalling improvements. This was done without any consultation with the PO, whose services could have been severely restricted for 10 days. Railtrack only relented and restored some access to the PO after a strong protest from the company. The PO is reluctant to pull out of rail. It has invested \u00a3200m in its own rail terminal at Willesden in north London, a hub from which its trains go to all parts of the country. This development had the effect of taking hundreds of PO vans off the roads, particularly in central London. The Willesden terminal has been supplemented by several regional centres in Bristol, Manchester and Scotland. Some members of the PO's board want the company to review its commitment to rail and revert to road. But this would require more investment and, with mounting congestion on the roads, might be counter-productive. EWS admits that its performance has not been good but says it hopes to resolve its difficulties with the PO. It has introduced newer, faster trains to haul the PO's mail fleet at speeds of more than 100mph, but large-scale engineering works by Railtrack do not make them easy to test.",

Some said the family had been thinking of moving to Bournemouth, Dorset. Mike Roper, 57, a newsagent, said the woman had worked part-time in Sainsbury's at South Ruislip: \"She was lovely, often spoke to my wife, because we had thought of moving to Dorset as well. \"She had just bought a dart board from the shop for the boy, and was worried about the darts because she did not want him to come to any harm.\" Detective Superintendent Nigel Mawer said police had been called after a friend visited the house and was unable to gain entry. \"Formal identification is still awaited, but we believe they are the family resident at the address. A postmortem will be carried out tomorrow morning.\" While police did not think anyone else was involved, he was \"keeping an open mind\".",

Yet doctors are still viewed as the people the public most trust, research has revealed. The Mori poll - which deliberately drew the public's attention to controversies such as Alder Hey, where some 3,000 childrens' organs were stored without their parents consent - found 89% of the public trust their doctors to tell the truth. This was a rise of 2% on last year when Harold Shipman was found guilty of murdering 15 female patients, and 7% on 1983 when Mori began polling on the issue. Their trustworthiness rating, which comes as a national audit office (NAO) report revealed the NHS owes \u00a33.9bn in compensation for medical negligence, places them above teachers, on 86%, and judges and the clergy, the latter of which have seen public trust slide from 85% in 1983 to 78%. The police are trusted by 63% of an increasingly cynical public, but, at 17%, the least trusted of all remain politicians. Perhaps surprisingly, given the second resignation of former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson, government ministers are viewed as more trustworthy than back benchers, at 20%, and are seen as more credible than journalists, trusted by 18%. The research, conducted for the British Medical Association (BMA), drew on interviews with nearly 2,000 people aged 15 and over in England, Scotland and Wales, which took place in late March - before the NAO report, or a hospital audit which last week revealed a third of all cervical cancer cases were undetected. But the face-to-face interviews did occur against a backdrop of increasingly high-profile media coverage of medical blunders, including the harm wreaked by disgraced gynae cologists Rodney Ledward and Richard Neale, and the recent hospital deaths of 18-year-old Wayne Jowett - who died in February when a junior doctor injected a powerful drug into his spine instead of his vein - and three-year-old Najiyah Hussain, who died in January when a consultant gave her a fatal dose of laughing gas instead of oxygen. Commenting on the results, which also found 89% of the public were fairly or very satisfied with the way doctors carried out their jobs, the BMA's chairman, Ian Bogle, said they belied fears of a crisis of public confidence in doctors. \"This shows that you should trust the public to make mature judgments based on their own experience,\" he said. \"Patients read about high profile cases and they want action taken against individual bad doctors but they do not make false links between very different kinds of problems and they know that doctors are doing a good job in difficult circumstances. \"Doctors will take great heart from this evidence, and I hope that politicians, commentators and doctors themselves really do absorb the lessons of this poll.

      "body": "<p>The Football Association last night gave full support to its chief executive Adam Crozier after he was accused of trying to mislead the public by attempting to secretly negotiate a deal with the government for the financing of the new Wembley stadium.</p> <p>According to reports, Mr Crozier wrote to Chris Smith, the sports minister, two weeks ago asking the government to underwrite the \u00a3660m project and said news of the deal could be kept secret until after the general election to prevent any public or political backlash.</p> <p>In his letter, Mr Crozier also requested that the government pay an initial \u00a3150m towards the Wembley project and \u00a31m a month to maintain its expenses. He wrote: \"The FA understands the difficulties the government will face in the political process of coming to a binding agreement but this must be done by May 23, although it can be kept under wraps until after the election.\"</p> <p>The letter has caused anger within government circles with officials privately accusing Mr Crozier of gross political naivety and greed. Last week the FA announced that it was not willing to solely fund the construction of a new national stadium, plunging the project into crisis.</p> <p>Last night the FA said the three-page letter was not an attempt to negotiate a secret deal and that there was no intention of a Wembley cover-up until after the election.</p> <p>An FA spokesman said: \"We have been in constant touch with the government on this issue. We were keen to bring the matter into the public domain ourselves and did so. It's never been our intention to cover anything up or prevent it from becoming publicly known.</p> <p>\"Everyone is aware that we are in a politically sensitive time and that was reflected in the correspondence. We always wanted a decision relatively quickly from the government and urged them to respond before the board meeting on April 26, which happened.</p> <p>\"There was and is no question of keeping anything under wraps. This is just another attempt to divert attention away from the fact that the government should support a national stadium. Adam Crozier has made it clear that people must stop playing politics on this issue and slinging mud at each other.

      "bodyText": "The Football Association last night gave full support to its chief executive Adam Crozier after he was accused of trying to mislead the public by attempting to secretly negotiate a deal with the government for the financing of the new Wembley stadium. According to reports, Mr Crozier wrote to Chris Smith, the sports minister, two weeks ago asking the government to underwrite the \u00a3660m project and said news of the deal could be kept secret until after the general election to prevent any public or political backlash. In his letter, Mr Crozier also requested that the government pay an initial \u00a3150m towards the Wembley project and \u00a31m a month to maintain its expenses. He wrote: \"The FA understands the difficulties the government will face in the political process of coming to a binding agreement but this must be done by May 23, although it can be kept under wraps until after the election.\" The letter has caused anger within government circles with officials privately accusing Mr Crozier of gross political naivety and greed. Last week the FA announced that it was not willing to solely fund the construction of a new national stadium, plunging the project into crisis. Last night the FA said the three-page letter was not an attempt to negotiate a secret deal and that there was no intention of a Wembley cover-up until after the election. An FA spokesman said: \"We have been in constant touch with the government on this issue. We were keen to bring the matter into the public domain ourselves and did so. It's never been our intention to cover anything up or prevent it from becoming publicly known. \"Everyone is aware that we are in a politically sensitive time and that was reflected in the correspondence. We always wanted a decision relatively quickly from the government and urged them to respond before the board meeting on April 26, which happened. \"There was and is no question of keeping anything under wraps. This is just another attempt to divert attention away from the fact that the government should support a national stadium. Adam Crozier has made it clear that people must stop playing politics on this issue and slinging mud at each other. He has called on everyone to work together.\" A Downing Street spokesman said: \"The whole thing has been completely blown out of proportion. We are not aware that he [Mr Crozier] was suggesting anything remotely improper. \"There's no acrimony between the government and the FA on this issue and the most important thing is to assume a viable way forward.\" Meanwhile, officials involved in the project categorically denied reports at the weekend that they had been involved in negotiations to turn the old stadium into a shopping complex if funding for a new stadium could not be secured.

      "bodyText": "The European Union sent Javier Solana, its foreign policy chief, to Skopje last night to urge the Macedonian government to try to keep a dangerously escalating situation under control, as fighting between ethnic Albanian rebels and security forces spread yesterday. Nato's secretary general, Lord Robertson, joins him today as western countries scramble to contain the worsening crisis one of only two former Yugoslav republics to have been spared full-scale conflict. Mr Solana will travel to Kosovo's capital, Pristina, today to urge its Albanian leaders to distance themselves from their rebel Macedonian kinsmen. EU foreign ministers meeting in Nykoping, Sweden, urged the Macedonian government not to declare a state of war and to continue the inter-ethnic dialogue it promised with the country's Albanian minority. Anna Lindh, the Swedish foreign minister, and the EU external relations commissioner, Chris Patten, are to go to the Macedonian capital, Skopje, later in the week to drive home the same message. Last month the EU signed a landmark \"stabilisation and association agreement\" with Macedonia which the member states want to use as a carrot to encourage dialogue between Slavs and Albanians. It was the first time in the bloody 10-year history of the break up of Yugoslavia that the EU seemed to have a useful independent role to play. Helicopter gunships, tanks and mortars were used to pound the villages of Slupcane and Vaksince again yesterday after the expiry of a deadline for civilians to leave the area.

The declaration would allow President Boris Trajkovski to form a new government and effectively rule by decree. However, observers said that while the idea was being discussed, Mr Trajkovski was per sonally opposed to the move. The declaration of a state of war would need a two-thirds majority in the Macedonian parliament and would be bitterly opposed by ethnic Albanian MPs, with whom the government has been negotiating to form a new coalition. In Slupcane, villagers huddled in cellars as the bombardment began after the expiry of the deadline to evacuate. Surrounded by up to 50 members of his extended family, Alidin Osmani, 50, said villagers had given up listening to the government's deadlines since his cousin, Rumsi Osmani, had been killed. \"He was outside on Thursday afternoon and 10 minutes before the deadline was due to expire he was killed by a mortar,\" Mr Osmani said.

      "bodyText": "Nearly 40 years after the American civil rights movement brought an end to official racial segregation, children in the United States are growing up in less racially integrated neighbourhoods than they were a decade ago, researchers have found. Last year's census has confirmed that America is now a more multiracial society than at any time in modern history, with non-Hispanic whites now a minority in several major cities. But researchers at the State University of New York say the same census reveals that American cities are becoming more racially divided than ever, an impression which is difficult to miss in somewhere like Washington. Over the past decade, cities such as Detroit, Chicago and Milwaukee have all become significantly more segregated than they were in 1990, the researchers found. The reality today is that young black Americans are growing up in a black America, while young whites are growing up in a white America. Social integration and even contact between the two races is rare and getting rarer, especially among school-age children. The problem diminishes once young people reach college, where integrated living accomodation is enforced. Levels of racial segregation are especially marked in urban schools and in the use of urban community services, largely as a result of \"white flight\" from the cities to the suburbs, the researchers found. Even when black middle-class parents flee the cities themselves, in search of the same improvements as white people, the result is the creation of largely black suburbs, rather than integrated ones. The researchers calculated the extent of segregation by comparing census enumeration areas in different cities be tween 1990 and 2000. The results show that the five most segregated cities are, in order: Detroit, Milwaukee, New York, Newark and Chicago. The most rapid increase in segregation since 1990 has been in Milwaukee, followed by Chicago, Detroit and Birmingham. In Milwaukee, black people now account for about one third of the city's inhabitants, but nearly two-thirds of the pupils in state schools. \"It's white flight and it's increasingly difficult to have any kind of meaningful desegregation or integration,\" a spokeswoman for the Milwaukee school system said. The findings underscore the extent to which racial divisions remain an integral aspect of everyday life in modern America, in spite of the progress which has been made in achieving formal equality between the black and white communities over the past 40 years. \"It's a very big problem for white children who may think that they're experiencing diversity in the country, but they are only getting a taste of it,\" researcher John Logan told the New York Times. \"For minority children, they're growing up in neighbourhoods where they are the majority, and that's not the world they will live in,\" Mr Logan added.

Partly my dislike of Rod The Mod was because I had to play Sailing, not a song I liked anyway, on the guitar at school.

      "body": "<p>\"Sometimes it takes a little explaining,\" says wildlife enthusiast Chris Watson, with admirable understatement. He is standing in the centre of Newcastle, in the middle of the night, as clubbers spill out on to the streets, surrounded by recording equipment including one of those very long, fluffy microphones. It doesn't take long for the local constabulary to spot him. </p> <p>\"We're making a radio programme,\" says Watson. \"A CD?\" says the policeman, revealing a promising future in avant-garde ambient music, perhaps, as a robin chirrups against a drunk, late, mad street soundscape. \"No, a radio programme, for International Dawn Chorus Day, on Radio 4. Remember to listen,\" adds Watson, cheerily. The police back off, quickly. </p> <p>Yesterday was that day and Watson began all the feathered fun with <strong> Tyneside Dawn </strong> (Radio 4), a portrait in sound of the nocturnal birdlife in Newcastle. Listening to this at 6.35am, bleary-eyed and clinging to tea, I soon realised that this is the middle of the day to birdsong enthusiasts. At 2.45am, Watson's out in his garden having been woken up by a blackbird: \"The song thrush is singing right into the microphone! You can hear the sparrows! One of the frogs in my garden pond's started up!\" </p> <p>But the human interest aspects of all this charming, sweet, nocturnal strangeness weren't touched upon. Do Watson's neighbours watch him as he watches birds? Does he stand out there, thrilling at the sound of baby robins \"foodbegging from their parents\", like whispering pneumatic drills, in his pyjamas? Do birdsong people even bother with pyjamas?

      "bodyText": "\"Sometimes it takes a little explaining,\" says wildlife enthusiast Chris Watson, with admirable understatement. He is standing in the centre of Newcastle, in the middle of the night, as clubbers spill out on to the streets, surrounded by recording equipment including one of those very long, fluffy microphones. It doesn't take long for the local constabulary to spot him. \"We're making a radio programme,\" says Watson. \"A CD?\" says the policeman, revealing a promising future in avant-garde ambient music, perhaps, as a robin chirrups against a drunk, late, mad street soundscape. \"No, a radio programme, for International Dawn Chorus Day, on Radio 4. Remember to listen,\" adds Watson, cheerily. The police back off, quickly. Yesterday was that day and Watson began all the feathered fun with Tyneside Dawn (Radio 4), a portrait in sound of the nocturnal birdlife in Newcastle. Listening to this at 6.35am, bleary-eyed and clinging to tea, I soon realised that this is the middle of the day to birdsong enthusiasts. At 2.45am, Watson's out in his garden having been woken up by a blackbird: \"The song thrush is singing right into the microphone! You can hear the sparrows! One of the frogs in my garden pond's started up!\" But the human interest aspects of all this charming, sweet, nocturnal strangeness weren't touched upon. Do Watson's neighbours watch him as he watches birds? Does he stand out there, thrilling at the sound of baby robins \"foodbegging from their parents\", like whispering pneumatic drills, in his pyjamas? Do birdsong people even bother with pyjamas? Instead, with Watson back on the streets, we heard blackcaps and willow warblers, skylarks and gulls, all chirruping away in the city, as trains thunder past and cars whizz by. That's what the whole day of themed programmes gamely tried to capture, the secret worlds of other creatures, including the enthusiasts themselves. It meant lots of bad puns in programme titles (Sound Advice, Up with the Bark, Music to Our Ears) but it also meant some small, joyous moments. Bill Oddie sprinkled dawn choruses from all over the world through the day's schedule - Venezuelan giant otters, American brown thrashers and, my favourite, the Russian marsh frog chorus.

      "body": "<p>Although he's not yet 50, the writer Stephen Poliakoff was such a prodigy - he had a play professionally staged while still at school - that he's lived through three ages of television drama. When he first wrote for TV in the 70s, the original drama for television was a regular event.

      "body": "<p>Zambia's president, Frederick Chiluba, has bowed to popular and parliamentary pressure and abandoned plans to amend the constitution so that he could run for a third term.</p> <p>Mr Chiluba backed down amid a barrage of local and international condemnation of his attempt to extend his 10-year rule. Members of his own cabinet and party denounced his scheme to run for another five years as president, and parliamentarians moved to impeach him for abuse of power.</p> <p>The South African and Botswanan governments pressed him not to amend the constitution. Foreign aid donors also expressed their displeasure.</p> <p>Mr Chiluba said on Friday that he was not going to run again, but many Zambians did not believe him because he has said it before, and because he left open the possibility of calling a referendum to amend the constitution to allow a president - any president - to seek a third term.</p> <p>After a fresh round of denunciations, in which Mr Chiluba was accused of duping ordinary Zambians, the president yesterday insisted he really does not intend to run for office again, but this time ruled out the possibility of a referendum.</p> <p>\"I'm not going to stand. I want to make it clear, clear, clear. I'm not standing for a third term,\" he said. \"I also want to put it categorically that there will be no referendum. There can never be a referendum if I am not standing.\"</p> <p>On Thursday, Mr Chiluba defied a high court order and dismissed his vice-president and eight other members of the cabinet from the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) after they opposed his successful attempt to amend his party's rules to permit him to be its candidate once again. The next step was to tamper with the constitution.</p> <p>Mr Chiluba set about a purge of dissenters on Friday by dissolving his entire cabinet and promptly re-appointing the more loyal members. He said he will announce the rest of his ministers today.</p> <p>The president's decision to clarify his intent followed a high-level meeting at which top officials warned that his attempt to extend his rule was likely to create widespread instability at home and harm Zambia's position overseas.</p> <p>Violence broke out at a rally of the ruling party on Saturday, apparently provoked by the ambivalence of Mr Chiluba's position. The president described the clashes as an attempt by his \"enemies\" to create anarchy.</p> <p>\"The demonstration yesterday was against a non-existent constitutional amendment. It was very clear that the demonstration was pre-determined to cause anarchy in the country,\" Mr Chiluba said.</p> <p>Mr Chiluba's decision - if he sticks by his word - will come as a relief not only to many in Zambia, who elected him a decade ago believing he was a different kind of African leader, but also to other presidents in a region already destabilised by Robert Mugabe's violent campaign against the opposition in neighbouring Zimbabwe.</p> <p>South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, was particularly concerned at events in Zambia and, unlike his policy of quiet diplomacy toward Zimbabwe, his government openly criticised Mr Chiluba's plan to cling on to power. But there was no such criticism when Sam Nujoma announced his plans to amend the Namibian constitution and give himself a third term as president, not least because the domestic criticism was muted.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Zambia's president, Frederick Chiluba, has bowed to popular and parliamentary pressure and abandoned plans to amend the constitution so that he could run for a third term. Mr Chiluba backed down amid a barrage of local and international condemnation of his attempt to extend his 10-year rule. Members of his own cabinet and party denounced his scheme to run for another five years as president, and parliamentarians moved to impeach him for abuse of power. The South African and Botswanan governments pressed him not to amend the constitution. Foreign aid donors also expressed their displeasure. Mr Chiluba said on Friday that he was not going to run again, but many Zambians did not believe him because he has said it before, and because he left open the possibility of calling a referendum to amend the constitution to allow a president - any president - to seek a third term. After a fresh round of denunciations, in which Mr Chiluba was accused of duping ordinary Zambians, the president yesterday insisted he really does not intend to run for office again, but this time ruled out the possibility of a referendum. \"I'm not going to stand. I want to make it clear, clear, clear. I'm not standing for a third term,\" he said. \"I also want to put it categorically that there will be no referendum. There can never be a referendum if I am not standing.\" On Thursday, Mr Chiluba defied a high court order and dismissed his vice-president and eight other members of the cabinet from the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) after they opposed his successful attempt to amend his party's rules to permit him to be its candidate once again. The next step was to tamper with the constitution. Mr Chiluba set about a purge of dissenters on Friday by dissolving his entire cabinet and promptly re-appointing the more loyal members. He said he will announce the rest of his ministers today. The president's decision to clarify his intent followed a high-level meeting at which top officials warned that his attempt to extend his rule was likely to create widespread instability at home and harm Zambia's position overseas. Violence broke out at a rally of the ruling party on Saturday, apparently provoked by the ambivalence of Mr Chiluba's position. The president described the clashes as an attempt by his \"enemies\" to create anarchy. \"The demonstration yesterday was against a non-existent constitutional amendment. It was very clear that the demonstration was pre-determined to cause anarchy in the country,\" Mr Chiluba said. Mr Chiluba's decision - if he sticks by his word - will come as a relief not only to many in Zambia, who elected him a decade ago believing he was a different kind of African leader, but also to other presidents in a region already destabilised by Robert Mugabe's violent campaign against the opposition in neighbouring Zimbabwe. South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, was particularly concerned at events in Zambia and, unlike his policy of quiet diplomacy toward Zimbabwe, his government openly criticised Mr Chiluba's plan to cling on to power. But there was no such criticism when Sam Nujoma announced his plans to amend the Namibian constitution and give himself a third term as president, not least because the domestic criticism was muted.",

Backed by lots of Universal money, Sommers cunningly crossbred the Mummy tale with the kind of \"Perils of Pauline\" story architecture we know from Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Half the time her plummy, Enid Blyton tones put me in mind of Angela Lansbury, the other half she's Lara Croft, emptying pump-action shotguns into the camera in a way that makes me weak at the knees.

      "body": "<p>Coronation Street, it has to be said, does not usually provide much useful commentary on feminist responses to sexual violence, not unless you have a very sophisticated reading of the marital squabbles of Jack and Vera Duckworth. Yet its recent storyline about the rape of teenager Toyah Battersby has, unwittingly, starkly highlighted the current crisis in Rape Crisis.</p> <p>After the harrowing episodes, Granada TV failed to broadcast a single rape helpline number, preferring to direct viewers to its website where they could click on links to Victim Support, the Samaritans or a dead-end link to the Rape Crisis Federation, an administrative body which does not provide counselling.</p> <p>The reason? It appears Rape Crisis, once a beacon of feminist solidarity and Reclaim the Night marches, is suffering from an image problem.</p> <p>\"We provided Coronation Street with advice about the storyline and stressed the importance of putting people in contact with us,\" says Julie Barnard, director of the Rape Crisis Federation. \"What they're really saying to Rape Crisis is, you're OK to provide us with juicy storylines, but not to provide support afterwards. It was the same with Grange Hill and a recent BBC rape documentary.\"</p> <p>Barnard says TV companies don't want to give out Rape Crisis numbers on air because they're frightened of saying the R word. \"It's fine to show it, but not to say it,\" she points out.</p> <p>\"We didn't single out Rape Crisis because we didn't want to concentrate on rape, but on violent crime in general,\" a Coronation Street spokeswoman says, though they used Toyah's terrified face in dozens of trailers.</p> <p>However, there is a much bigger reason why the TV companies, as well as many other public information bodies, are no longer confident about giving out Rape Crisis hotline numbers. Many of Britain's 65 centres have been reduced to offering a skeleton service of just two hours per week. There are long waiting lists, up to two years in some regions, without the added burden of TV advertising, and people outside the movement are beginning to hear about it.</p> <p>\"Most charities can't cope with caller demand, which is often 500 calls in the first half hour,\" says Donald Steele at the BBC. \"So we give out our audience helpline.\" Is it staffed by trained rape counsellors? \"No, not specifically, but they are used to dealing with people in extreme distress.\"</p> <p>The most chilling example of the problems in Rape Crisis is in London, where one of the country's flagship centres opened its doors 25 years ago. It should be celebrating its continued success this summer; instead it has been forced to suspend the service.</p> <p>The strength of Rape Crisis has always been that it offers women a way forward, to find some sense of peace in the weeks and years following their ordeal.

      "bodyText": "Coronation Street, it has to be said, does not usually provide much useful commentary on feminist responses to sexual violence, not unless you have a very sophisticated reading of the marital squabbles of Jack and Vera Duckworth. Yet its recent storyline about the rape of teenager Toyah Battersby has, unwittingly, starkly highlighted the current crisis in Rape Crisis. After the harrowing episodes, Granada TV failed to broadcast a single rape helpline number, preferring to direct viewers to its website where they could click on links to Victim Support, the Samaritans or a dead-end link to the Rape Crisis Federation, an administrative body which does not provide counselling. The reason? It appears Rape Crisis, once a beacon of feminist solidarity and Reclaim the Night marches, is suffering from an image problem. \"We provided Coronation Street with advice about the storyline and stressed the importance of putting people in contact with us,\" says Julie Barnard, director of the Rape Crisis Federation. \"What they're really saying to Rape Crisis is, you're OK to provide us with juicy storylines, but not to provide support afterwards. It was the same with Grange Hill and a recent BBC rape documentary.\" Barnard says TV companies don't want to give out Rape Crisis numbers on air because they're frightened of saying the R word. \"It's fine to show it, but not to say it,\" she points out. \"We didn't single out Rape Crisis because we didn't want to concentrate on rape, but on violent crime in general,\" a Coronation Street spokeswoman says, though they used Toyah's terrified face in dozens of trailers. However, there is a much bigger reason why the TV companies, as well as many other public information bodies, are no longer confident about giving out Rape Crisis hotline numbers. Many of Britain's 65 centres have been reduced to offering a skeleton service of just two hours per week. There are long waiting lists, up to two years in some regions, without the added burden of TV advertising, and people outside the movement are beginning to hear about it. \"Most charities can't cope with caller demand, which is often 500 calls in the first half hour,\" says Donald Steele at the BBC. \"So we give out our audience helpline.\" Is it staffed by trained rape counsellors? \"No, not specifically, but they are used to dealing with people in extreme distress.\" The most chilling example of the problems in Rape Crisis is in London, where one of the country's flagship centres opened its doors 25 years ago. It should be celebrating its continued success this summer; instead it has been forced to suspend the service. The strength of Rape Crisis has always been that it offers women a way forward, to find some sense of peace in the weeks and years following their ordeal. Now women in London do not have that option. Most distressing of all, many victims, not realising the service is no longer running, leave their details on the answering machine still listed in the phone book.

      "bodyText": "The Bush administration is planning to slash spending on nuclear safety projects in Russia, raising fears that slacker controls on the porous Russian nuclear industry could bring an upsurge in the trafficking of radioactive materials. Throughout the 1990s the US spent billions of dollars on various programmes in Russia aimed at securing nuclear stockpiles against theft, decommissioning weapons-grade uranium and plutonium or converting it for civilian use, and retraining and paying Russian nuclear scientists in order to discourage them from taking their expertise elsewhere. The policy has been widely seen as one of the few relatively successful aid programmes to Russia and the Clinton administration had signalled a 50% increase in funds this year for the projects run mainly by the Pentagon and the US Department of Energy. But White House budget plans from the Bush team have scrapped the proposed increases and instead cut the $800m (\u00a3571m) allocated to the energy department by around $100m or more than 12%. \"It seems that some projects will need to be scrapped,\" said Igor Kudrik, a Russian expert on his country's nuclear industry at the Bellona environmental watchdog in Norway. The Republicans came to office in Washington fiercely critical of what they viewed as the Clinton government's failed economic and aid policies towards Russia. The proposed nuclear safety cuts are the first concrete evidence of reduced spending on Russia, though US and Russian experts predict the cuts will encounter strong resistance in Congress. \"There are prominent people in Washington, including Republicans, who want to restore and expand the spending, arguing that the nuclear problem is a threat to the US and not a favour to Russia,\" said Sergei Rogov, Moscow's top expert on the US. Indeed, a recent US government sponsored report recommended that up to $30bn be spent on containing the Russian proliferation risk over the next decade. Instead, under the Bush plans, experts say, key programmes could be eliminated, hastening a Russian brain drain and making it more tempting for Russian nuclear physicists to ply their trade in countries Washington views as rogue states. A billion-dollar scheme to decommission 68 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium, agreed by Presidents Clinton and Vladimir Putin in Moscow last year, is likely to be halted by the Bush administration, said Mr Kudrik. A separate project promoting the development of hi-tech enterprises and retraining Russian nuclear scientists to work in them could also go. More than 2,000 Russian nuclear scientists are employed in such schemes. Employment is on offer from such US bugbears as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. In the eight years since the US energy department inaugurated its nuclear containment projects in the former Soviet Union, new security systems have been installed at 113 sites. But this is a gargantuan work in progress, securing a mere fraction of weapons-grade material regarded as risky across Russia. Apart from planning to cut the nuclear safety funding, the US is also threatening to suspend most other aid to Russia if it concludes that Russian sales of nuclear technology for power plants in Iran are helping the country build a nuclear bomb. Last week the US state department put Iran at the top of its league table of countries sponsoring terrorism. \"American officials are convinced both that Iran plans to use that reactor to develop nuclear weapons, and that Iran's possession of nuclear weapons threatens US national security and that of its vital allies,\" Celeste Wallander of the US Council on Foreign Relations wrote in an analysis last month of the Bush administration's policies on Russia. But in the bout of tension between the Bush and Putin governments, says Mr Rogov, the Russians are pushing ahead with the Iranian contracts because they have concluded that there will be no reward from the West for good behaviour. \"We're damned if we do, and damned if we don't,\" he added.",

      "body": "<p>Polly Toynbee claims (Doctors may protest but they've never had it so good, May 2) that \"things look set to get much better in the NHS\". Anyone working in the health service (which I left 15 years ago) will tell of precipitously falling standards of hygiene and service and widespread absence of adequately qualified or experienced staff.</p> <p>For example, a staff nurse I know in a Huntingdon hospital recently searched for 20 minutes for a thermometer. My mother, who has been diagnosed with incipient glaucoma by her optometrist, has been told waiting lists to see an ophthalmologist are closed at six months at the local hospital. The GP has received a letter asking for no more eye referrals to be sent.</p> <p>I work in the insurance industry, escorting sick holidaymakers back from hospitals in Spain, France, Italy and other countries, where standards are conspicuously better. I can only advise the patients I meet to have their treatment overseas.</p> <p>It has come to the point where the NHS is not just in crisis, it is being surreptitiously downgraded and dismantled. Soon it will become the threadbare safety net that is the public health system in the United States and, as there, everyone that can afford it will be paying private health insurance. <br> <b>Dr Stephen Coombs</b><br> London</p> <p>\u0095 I am a GP and, frankly, I am insulted by Polly Toynbee's implication that we are obsessed with making money.

      "bodyText": "Polly Toynbee claims (Doctors may protest but they've never had it so good, May 2) that \"things look set to get much better in the NHS\". Anyone working in the health service (which I left 15 years ago) will tell of precipitously falling standards of hygiene and service and widespread absence of adequately qualified or experienced staff. For example, a staff nurse I know in a Huntingdon hospital recently searched for 20 minutes for a thermometer. My mother, who has been diagnosed with incipient glaucoma by her optometrist, has been told waiting lists to see an ophthalmologist are closed at six months at the local hospital. The GP has received a letter asking for no more eye referrals to be sent. I work in the insurance industry, escorting sick holidaymakers back from hospitals in Spain, France, Italy and other countries, where standards are conspicuously better. I can only advise the patients I meet to have their treatment overseas. It has come to the point where the NHS is not just in crisis, it is being surreptitiously downgraded and dismantled. Soon it will become the threadbare safety net that is the public health system in the United States and, as there, everyone that can afford it will be paying private health insurance. Dr Stephen Coombs London \u0095 I am a GP and, frankly, I am insulted by Polly Toynbee's implication that we are obsessed with making money.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A desk editor on this very newspaper - a long time ago, and in a different climate - once challenged a proposed jazz feature of mine with the incredulous query: \"How can you possibly write 500 words about a drummer?\" The objection was coming from the incredulity of high culture as to the place of musical bit-part players, but it could just as easily have been popular culture incredulity too. Gags about drummers - their presumed crassness, unmusicality and general absurdity - have been amiably prevalent in the rock and pop world too.</p> <p>Billy Higgins, the Los Angeles-born drummer who has died of kidney failure aged 64, was the kind of performer who despatched all that dismissive mythology single-handed - and he could deliver some thoroughly dazzling percussion information single-handedly too, though pyrotechnical displays were not his idea of a good time. When Higgins is described, words like \"warmth\", \"love\" and \"joy\" often wing by . These were not fanciful associations but occasioned as much by Higgins' appearance on a bandstand as by the astonishingly light, airy, dancing manner of his playing.</p> <p>Few jazz drummers have ever looked as relaxed onstage or as much in their element as Higgins. A lithe, graceful man, he appeared to play almost unconcernedly, arms moving in arcs, the blur of the sticks on the cymbals taking on a plastic malleability. His fluid, caressingly subtle cymbal beat, a soft surge of sound that on its own would confound every cliche about unsubtle drummers, and which could lift the most laggardly of soloists into inspiration, was legendary on the jazz circuit for 40 years. But almost the best-loved feature of Higgins' presence in any ensemble was that broad smile he seemed to wear virtually without pause in performance.</p> <p>Higgins was celebrated for his associations with some of the greatest figures in jazz - Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane, Dexter Gordon and Sonny Rollins among them - but it was for his membership of Ornette Coleman's quartet in the early 60s that he is perhaps most highly regarded. He was already on the map when he joined the iconoclastic saxophonist - he had worked with r &amp; b bands including Bo Diddley's, and with singers Brook Benton and Sister Rosetta Tharpe in the mid-1950s. But in working in the Jazz Messiahs with trumpeter Don Cherry, and in joining bassist Red Mitchell's group in 1957, Higgins entered the high-profile world of the Los Angeles jazz scene at a time when the West Coast's music was being celebrated for its growing independence from New York.</p> <p>This was to ratchet up several notches, and not necessarily to the satisfaction of all jazz fans, with the arrival in LA of Texan saxophonist Ornette Coleman in the mid 50s. Coleman began private workshop sessions with Higgins, trumpeter Don Cherry and bassist Charlie Haden; explorations which led to the birth of the Ornette Coleman Quartet.</p> <p>Coleman regularly used New Orleans drummer Ed Blackwell first, followed by Higgins; the two alternated in Coleman's bands throughout the 60s and 70s, with Higgins loose-limbed and mercurial, Blackwell fizzy, clipped and staccato, but both furnishing the alert, adaptable swing Coleman's intuitive music-making required. Higgins appeared on Coleman's early Los Angeles recordings in 1958-59, went with him to New York on Coleman's first appearance there, then left to work with quartets led by Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane in 1960.</p> <p>Two years later, Higgins was with Sonny Rollins, and then - with saxophonists Dexter Gordon and Hank Mobley, trumpeters Donald Byrd and Lee Morgan, and the young and fast-evolving Herbie Hancock - on a stream of session recordings for Blue Note that were later to become classics.

      "bodyText": "A desk editor on this very newspaper - a long time ago, and in a different climate - once challenged a proposed jazz feature of mine with the incredulous query: \"How can you possibly write 500 words about a drummer?\" The objection was coming from the incredulity of high culture as to the place of musical bit-part players, but it could just as easily have been popular culture incredulity too. Gags about drummers - their presumed crassness, unmusicality and general absurdity - have been amiably prevalent in the rock and pop world too. Billy Higgins, the Los Angeles-born drummer who has died of kidney failure aged 64, was the kind of performer who despatched all that dismissive mythology single-handed - and he could deliver some thoroughly dazzling percussion information single-handedly too, though pyrotechnical displays were not his idea of a good time. When Higgins is described, words like \"warmth\", \"love\" and \"joy\" often wing by . These were not fanciful associations but occasioned as much by Higgins' appearance on a bandstand as by the astonishingly light, airy, dancing manner of his playing. Few jazz drummers have ever looked as relaxed onstage or as much in their element as Higgins. A lithe, graceful man, he appeared to play almost unconcernedly, arms moving in arcs, the blur of the sticks on the cymbals taking on a plastic malleability. His fluid, caressingly subtle cymbal beat, a soft surge of sound that on its own would confound every cliche about unsubtle drummers, and which could lift the most laggardly of soloists into inspiration, was legendary on the jazz circuit for 40 years. But almost the best-loved feature of Higgins' presence in any ensemble was that broad smile he seemed to wear virtually without pause in performance. Higgins was celebrated for his associations with some of the greatest figures in jazz - Thelonious Monk, John Coltrane, Dexter Gordon and Sonny Rollins among them - but it was for his membership of Ornette Coleman's quartet in the early 60s that he is perhaps most highly regarded. He was already on the map when he joined the iconoclastic saxophonist - he had worked with r &amp; b bands including Bo Diddley's, and with singers Brook Benton and Sister Rosetta Tharpe in the mid-1950s. But in working in the Jazz Messiahs with trumpeter Don Cherry, and in joining bassist Red Mitchell's group in 1957, Higgins entered the high-profile world of the Los Angeles jazz scene at a time when the West Coast's music was being celebrated for its growing independence from New York. This was to ratchet up several notches, and not necessarily to the satisfaction of all jazz fans, with the arrival in LA of Texan saxophonist Ornette Coleman in the mid 50s. Coleman began private workshop sessions with Higgins, trumpeter Don Cherry and bassist Charlie Haden; explorations which led to the birth of the Ornette Coleman Quartet. Coleman regularly used New Orleans drummer Ed Blackwell first, followed by Higgins; the two alternated in Coleman's bands throughout the 60s and 70s, with Higgins loose-limbed and mercurial, Blackwell fizzy, clipped and staccato, but both furnishing the alert, adaptable swing Coleman's intuitive music-making required. Higgins appeared on Coleman's early Los Angeles recordings in 1958-59, went with him to New York on Coleman's first appearance there, then left to work with quartets led by Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane in 1960. Two years later, Higgins was with Sonny Rollins, and then - with saxophonists Dexter Gordon and Hank Mobley, trumpeters Donald Byrd and Lee Morgan, and the young and fast-evolving Herbie Hancock - on a stream of session recordings for Blue Note that were later to become classics. Higgins was also present at the first recordings of two soul-jazz landmarks that were to resurface as anthems in the acid-jazz boom of two decades later - Hancock's Watermelon Man and Morgan's The Sidewinder. Higgins was active as a drum teacher over the past 25 years and also began a trio association with the former Art Blakey pianist Cedar Walton in 1966. He was also co-leader (with Bill Lee and Bill Hardman) of the Brass Company in 1972-73, but it was with Walton that many younger musicians first encountered the drummer's elegantly inspirational work. The partnership with Walton continued into the 1990s, when Higgins' health problems began to disrupt it. Through the 70s and 80s, Higgins was a popular drum choice for a wide variety of jazz leaders, from Milt Jackson, Art Pepper and JJ Johnson to Pat Metheny. With all of them, and as long as he was making good music, he usually looked like a man in paradise while seated at the drums. He is survived by four sons and two daughters. Val Wilmer writes: Billy Higgins played music with love.

Many observers believed that the convictions of the men for the bombing of a pub in Birmingham in 1974 would be quashed, but Lord Justice Lane said that the longer the proceedings had continued, the more the court had become convinced of the guilt of the men. Sir Patrick added that simply by reading the transcripts of evidence relating to alleged confessions, it would have been surprising had the jury not decided that the defendants had been lying but also that they had \"jointly concerted their lies\". It was not until 1991 that the convictions were finally quashed. At this point there was some criticism of Lord Lane and Sir Patrick but it was partially explained away by the fact that the 1991 court looked at different scientific evidence.</p> <p>The son of a doctor, O'Connor was born into a Catholic family in India. He was sent to Downside and then, to Merton College, Oxford, of which he was made an honorary fellow in 1987. At the beginning of the war he was called to the Bar, joining Inner Temple (of which he was appointed a master of the bench in 1966).

It was a case - which so far as the Bar was concerned - O'Connor fortunately lost. Clients could not sue their barristers for their actions in court.

He was also the deputy chairman of the Isle of Wight quarter sessions from 1957 until their abolition in 1971 following the Beeching Report.</p> <p>The year after his appointment to the bench, O'Connor presided over the trial of Dennis Stafford and Michael Luvaglio who were accused of murdering Angus Sibbett in a quarrel over gaming machines in the north-east. Their convictions, perhaps not on the strongest of prosecution cases, have also led to a long-running and continuing series of appeals and efforts to prove their innocence.</p> <p>That same year he sentenced the south London gang leader Charles Richardson to 12 years for attempting to get at the jury in a trial involving Richardson's younger brother, Eddie.

      "body": "<p>As Tiger Woods basks in the glory of achieving what many people thought was impossible - holding all four major golf championships at once - golfers worldwide are looking to North America to see how he did it. </p> <p>For some time Gordon Brown, too, has been looking enviously across the Atlantic to see what he could glean from the performance of the US economy, particularly the stellar rise in productivity in the second half of the 1990s. But in order to learn more from America it is crucial to address all the factors at play. </p> <p>A recent study by the Engineering Employers' Federation (EEF) has looked at the reasons behind the strong productivity performance of US manufacturers. </p> <p>There are logical reasons behind the US advantage in golf and manufacturing. The sheer number of people playing golf and the money that goes into the game gives the US an inherent advantage. </p> <p>Size also matters to the manufacturers there who have a homogenised, more protected domestic market six times bigger than that of the UK. This allows them to benefit from economies of scale and fewer demands for variations of their final product. </p> <p>The US also benefits from a larger IT manufacturing base, which performed exceptionally well. </p> <p>Irrespective of some of the \"natural\" advantages that the US enjoys there is still plenty we can learn from Uncle Sam. The attention that is paid to every aspect of Tiger Woods's game and the continued pursuit of perfection has to be applauded. Similarly we can learn from the experience of US manufacturers that have applied lean manufacturing (removing waste from all aspects) so intensely and with single-minded pursuit of continuous improvement. </p> <p>Firms have profited from these techniques by marrying their implementation with the use of IT, enabling them to get detailed information on their performance. Many British firms have dabbled in these lean techniques but have failed to replicate the intensity and the end results of their US counterparts. </p> <p>Higher rewards are on offer in US golf in terms of prize money and sponsorship. Similarly, in US manufacturing average earnings in the late 1990s were 20% higher than in the UK when adjusted for the greater purchasing power of the dollar. US firms have also made much more use of performance and profit-related pay, offering greater incentives to their employees. </p> <p>By contrast, in the UK at tempts to improve productivity meet with more resistance given their association with job losses and retrenchment. </p> <p>The close knit team of Tiger, his father Earl and coach Butch Harman has been behind his rise to fame. American manufacturers also appear better at working together as a team. Two-way communication between US managers and employees is freer flowing, with the end results that our firms are less effective at implementing change and US firms benefit from more employee involvement. </p> <p>Employers are instrumental in tackling most of these issues. However, this does not let the government off the hook. Just like America's investment in all aspects of golf has paid off, our research pinpointed high investment and R&amp;D as key factors in the success of US manufacturing. Sterling's volatility (and recent overvaluation) and a greater risk averse investment culture in North America have com bined to give firms a larger and newer capital stock. </p> <p>Gordon Brown must recognise that government action is needed to give manufacturing the impetus to break into the US cycle of higher investment, productivity, earnings and profitability. </p> <p>The chancellor's approach has limited itself to encouraging greater investment in IT by small firms. One area where the chancellor could act promptly is by extending capital allowances to cover investment in IT. </p> <p>Tiger Woods would struggle to beat the rest of the world if he was forced to play with one hand tied behind his back.

      "bodyText": "As Tiger Woods basks in the glory of achieving what many people thought was impossible - holding all four major golf championships at once - golfers worldwide are looking to North America to see how he did it. For some time Gordon Brown, too, has been looking enviously across the Atlantic to see what he could glean from the performance of the US economy, particularly the stellar rise in productivity in the second half of the 1990s. But in order to learn more from America it is crucial to address all the factors at play. A recent study by the Engineering Employers' Federation (EEF) has looked at the reasons behind the strong productivity performance of US manufacturers. There are logical reasons behind the US advantage in golf and manufacturing. The sheer number of people playing golf and the money that goes into the game gives the US an inherent advantage. Size also matters to the manufacturers there who have a homogenised, more protected domestic market six times bigger than that of the UK. This allows them to benefit from economies of scale and fewer demands for variations of their final product. The US also benefits from a larger IT manufacturing base, which performed exceptionally well. Irrespective of some of the \"natural\" advantages that the US enjoys there is still plenty we can learn from Uncle Sam. The attention that is paid to every aspect of Tiger Woods's game and the continued pursuit of perfection has to be applauded. Similarly we can learn from the experience of US manufacturers that have applied lean manufacturing (removing waste from all aspects) so intensely and with single-minded pursuit of continuous improvement. Firms have profited from these techniques by marrying their implementation with the use of IT, enabling them to get detailed information on their performance. Many British firms have dabbled in these lean techniques but have failed to replicate the intensity and the end results of their US counterparts. Higher rewards are on offer in US golf in terms of prize money and sponsorship. Similarly, in US manufacturing average earnings in the late 1990s were 20% higher than in the UK when adjusted for the greater purchasing power of the dollar. US firms have also made much more use of performance and profit-related pay, offering greater incentives to their employees. By contrast, in the UK at tempts to improve productivity meet with more resistance given their association with job losses and retrenchment. The close knit team of Tiger, his father Earl and coach Butch Harman has been behind his rise to fame. American manufacturers also appear better at working together as a team. Two-way communication between US managers and employees is freer flowing, with the end results that our firms are less effective at implementing change and US firms benefit from more employee involvement. Employers are instrumental in tackling most of these issues. However, this does not let the government off the hook. Just like America's investment in all aspects of golf has paid off, our research pinpointed high investment and R&amp;D as key factors in the success of US manufacturing. Sterling's volatility (and recent overvaluation) and a greater risk averse investment culture in North America have com bined to give firms a larger and newer capital stock. Gordon Brown must recognise that government action is needed to give manufacturing the impetus to break into the US cycle of higher investment, productivity, earnings and profitability. The chancellor's approach has limited itself to encouraging greater investment in IT by small firms. One area where the chancellor could act promptly is by extending capital allowances to cover investment in IT. Tiger Woods would struggle to beat the rest of the world if he was forced to play with one hand tied behind his back. Yet many manufacturers are expected to do just that as they are bound up with more and more government red tape. The chancellor has failed to realise that his goal of increasing productivity does not go hand in hand with the increasing burden of regulation. Similarly, it is the government's responsibility to ensure planning permission is easier and cheaper to obtain. Past victories in the Ryder Cup show that through teamwork we can overcome the golfing gap with the US. If employers, trade unions and the chancellor can work together to remove the barriers to productivity improvement they too would make a formidable combination. Employers must take their share of the responsibility, but Gordon Brown must also ensure that the government adopts a more comprehensive approach to overcome the productivity gap.
