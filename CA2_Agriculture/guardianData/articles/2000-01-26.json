      "bodyText": "Bradford City yesterday pulled out of the race to sign Stan Collymore when it became apparent that Aston Villa want around \u00a33m for the player. \"The only way we could sign Collymore is on a free transfer; anything else causes an insurmountable problem,\" the Bradford chairman Geoffrey Richmond said. Leicester City's manager Martin O'Neill has held preliminary talks with Collymore's advisers, although he is also unlikely to match Villa's valuation of a 29-year-old striker who has been conspicuous by his absence this season. Silvio Maric, an expensive legacy of Ruud Gullit's tenure at Newcastle, yesterday joined Croatia Zagreb on loan until the end of the season. Eleven months ago he moved in the opposite direction for \u00a33.5m in a deal believed to be worth \u00a330,000 a week. Sunderland's want-away winger Allan Johnston has joined Bolton on loan. Southampton's record signing David Hirst has retired at the age of 32 after failing to recover from a long-standing knee injury. The striker, who scored one goal for England in his three games, was a \u00a32m buy from Sheffield Wednesday but never got over a freak accident while training in June 1998. He last started a first-team game 20 months ago.",

The deal agreed by the Scottish cabinet and Labour and Lib Dem backbenchers yesterday sheds around \u00a320m from the cost of Cubie's proposals. But, while the Lib Dems claimed to have abolished tuition fees and Labour said it had broken the impasse which threatened to bring down the coalition, both were accused of caving in to Westminster. Under the new deal, up-front tuition fees will be abolished from September for all Scottish and EU - but not English or Welsh - students studying in Scotland. Fees will be replaced by graduate contributions. Graduates will pay \u00a32,000 into the scheme once they are earning \u00a310,000 a year. Under Cubie, graduates would have had to pay higher contributions, but not until they were earning \u00a325,000. The deal will not be offered to Scottish students elsewhere in the UK because of problems with EU legislation. Ministers say they may have been forced to extend the benefit to all EU students studying in Britain at an annual cost of up to \u00a3100m - unacceptable to the education secretary David Blunkett. \"At London's instigation the executive has watered down the Cubie report,\" said shadow lifelong learning minister John Swinney. \"This has nothing to do with EU law.\" From next year, Scottish students whose parents earn less than \u00a323,000 will be eligible for grants of up to \u00a32,000. The Scottish secretary, John Reid, said yesterday that funding for the deal must come from existing Holyrood funds. As cross-party unrest grew at Westminster over the better deal for Scots, Mr Blunkett announced a \u00a368m package for England and Wales targeting mature students, disadvantaged young people and parents on low incomes with children in higher education.",

Just over 48,000 voting slips are being posted to eligible rank and file members of the London Labour Party for the election which will decide between the three short-listed candidates Frank Dobson, Ken Livingstone and Glenda Jackson. Ballot papers will also go out to London MPs, MEPs and candidates for the Greater London Authority as well as to affiliated trade unions and socialist societies which make up the electoral college which will choose the party's candidate in the May 4 mayoral election. If neither of the two frontrunners, Mr Livingstone and Mr Dobson, achieves an overall majority when votes are returned by the February 16 closing date, the second preference votes of Ms Jackson's supporters are expected to decide the election in favour of Mr Livingstone. Prime Minister Tony Blair and his deputy John Prescott were expected to launch a new attack on Mr Livingstone today after a Guardian survey earlier this week showed their preferred candidate, Mr Dobson, trailing in the polls behind the left-wing Brent East MP. The survey found that Mr Livingstone could win more than 65% of the party members' votes and could be within reach of an outright victory. But Mr Dobson insisted he is \"increasingly confident\" of victory and, in his latest mailshot to Labour members, the former health secretary renewed his attack on his left-wing rival, saying: \"Those across the party who know him best don't trust him. Be in no doubt that Ken, who has used this campaign to attack our government, would do so even more vigorously as mayor.\" The Prime Minister's official spokesman said voting was a matter for Labour party members but \"if they have any sense\" they would take note of the opinions of senior figures like Mr Blair and the Chancellor Gordon Brown - who have made plain their support for Mr Dobson - rather than the views of newspapers. Meanwhile, Glenda Jackson was accused of \"collaboration\" with Ken Livingstone by the one Labour MP in the capital who had planned to support her in the ballot. Ealing North MP Stephen Pound announced today he would be switching his allegiance to Frank Dobson after consulting with members of his constituency party. The party's general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, told the ruling National Executive Committee this week that the party would review the system of selecting a candidate for future mayoral elections and consider a move to a one-member, one-vote ballot.",

Her debut novel, White Teeth (Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99) has received an astonishing chorus of praise. Smith, a 24-year-old just out of Cambridge, had been given a \u00a3250,000 advance and hailed as \"the new Salman Rushdie\" by her publisher. \"For once\", said the usually testy Hugo Barnacle in the Sunday Times, \"here is a Big New Literary Find that hasn't been oversold.\"</p> <p>That was echoed everywhere. \"Hamish Hamilton's publicists have made much of the fact that Smith is herself part of this entrepreneurial, multicultural Britain - she is young, she is half-Jamaican and she wrote the novel in quiet moments while revising for finals at Cambridge,\" wrote Melissa Denes in the Daily Telegraph. \"But it would not matter if she were a he, white and the wrong side of 40: Smith can write. Her novel has energy, pace, humour and fully formed characters; it is blissfully free of the introversion and self-conscious detail that mar many first novels. Smith has stories to tell and, in the tradition of Peter Carey and Salman Rushdie, she just gets on with them; the dialogue is pitch-perfect, the comedy neat and underplayed.\"</p> <p> Denes had a half-hearted quibble: \"There is a false climax that attempts to unite far too many characters and storylines: here Smith is only spelling out themes - about family and belonging and history - already implicit in the narrative. And there is something too pat (and too punning) in the conclusion that we should not perpetuate 'the myth, the wicked lie, that the past is always tense and the future, perfect'.\" But, she concluded, \"these are small weaknesses in what is a bounding, vibrant, richly imagined and thoroughly engaging whole.\"</p> <p> Those much-mentioned Hamish Hamilton publicists will have no shortage of encomia for the paperback. \"The 'mongrel' nation that is Britain is still struggling to find a way to stare into the mirror and accept the ebb and flow of history that has produced this fortuitously diverse condition and its concomitant pain,\" wrote Caryl Phillips weightily in the Observer. \"Zadie Smith's first novel is an audaciously assured contribution to this process of staring into the mirror. Her narrator is deeply self-conscious, so much so that one can almost hear the crisp echo of Salman Rushdie's footsteps. However, her wit, her breadth of vision and her ambition are of her own making. The plot is rich, at times dizzyingly so, but White Teeth squares up to the two questions which gnaw at the very roots of our modern condition: Who are we? Why are we here?\"</p> <p> It wasn't easy for critics to explain what this dizzying book was actually about. Detailing plotlines is the bane of fiction reviewing; boiled down to 300 words, plots sound confusing or ludicrous or, more often, both. Phillips had a lengthy go, but it defeated him. \"This multi-layered, deeply-plotted novel resists easy categorisation, which is precisely the author's point.\" (And a useful get-out clause for reviewers.)</p> <p> So, epic serio-comic saga following the fortunes of two families from Bangladesh and Jamaica who have fetched up in the melting pot that is Willesden will have to do plot-wise. Too much detail just gets in the way. Maya Jaggi's more lateral approach in the Guardian certainly made the book sound engaging: \"Its characters embrace Jehovah's Witnesses, halal butchers, eugenicists, animal-rights activists and a group of Muslim militants who labour under the unfortunate acronym KEVIN.\" I'd buy that.</p> <p> Jaggi picked up on the symbolism of the final image: \"the escape of a small brown laboratory mouse, which may be genetically programmed to turn albino-white, but which gladly seizes its freedom and runs with it\". That freedom - along with greater tolerance and a sense of a society increasingly at ease with itself - was mentioned elsewhere: \"Her attitude to the complications and conflicts, loves and hates that inevitably result from living in a cultural melting pot is not only post-imperial but post-racial,\" wrote Anne Chisholm in the Sunday Telegraph. \"One of the endearing qualities of her sharp-eyed but warm-hearted book is that it makes racism appear not only ugly and stupid but ludicrously out of date, like the politician referred to as 'E. Knock someone or other'.\"</p> <p> A \"post-racial society\" is a controversial notion and could have been mined more: there are plenty of people who would disagree with that description of Britain and it would be interesting to hear their view of Smith's \"warm-hearted\" novel. Smith herself, in an interview in the Observer, hinted that she was keen not to be seen as a writer of baggy, generous, all-life-is-here novels. \"When I was little, we'd go on holiday to Devon, and there, if you're black and you go into a sweetshop, for instance, everyone turns and looks at you. So my instinct as a child was always to over-compensate by trying to behave three times as well as every other child in the shop, so they knew I wasn't going to take anything or hurt anyone. I think that instinct has spilled over into my writing in some ways, which is not something I like very much or want to continue.\"</p> <p> There was one less than ecstatic review, in the literary magazine Butterfly. \"This kind of precocity in so young a writer has one half of the audience standing to applaud and the other half wishing, as with child performers of the past (Shirley Temple, Bonnie Langford et al), she would just stay still and shut up. White Teeth is the literary equivalent of a hyperactive, ginger-haired tap-dancing 10-year-old.\" The review, according to Sam Wallace in the Daily Telegraph, was written by Smith herself.</p>",

Liberal opinion is outraged that more than 100,000 human beings are now in limbo, waiting for a cumbersome government machine to tell them whether they can stay. Less worthily, there are cries of woe from those who believe our crowded little island is being swamped by indigent refugees, bankrupted by benefit bludgers, and culturally undermined by foreigners. The latter arguments are specious to say the least. Britain has thrived on migration for at least 400 years. Countless millions have sought better lives in the wider world, and rather fewer millions have sought and received a welcome on our shores.

Particularly not a 32-year-old Buddhist with a Craig Johnston tribute haircut. Which is just as well really, because reports this morning suggesting that Roberto Baggio is on his way to Anfield appear to be wider of the mark than a Vladimir Smicer 'piledriver'.</p> <p>It all started this morning when an Inter official was quoted in the Mirror as saying, \"We are aware of interest in Roberto Baggio from a representative of Liverpool.\" But when asked for their view on events, Liverpool could only manage a dismissive \"we never comment on media speculation\". In fact, latest reports suggest that the representative was Ron Dixon, trying to hire some new cleaning staff for Great Grannies.</p> <p>As for Baggio himself, he is happy in Milan.

Particularly not a 32-year-old Buddhist with a Craig Johnston tribute haircut. Which is just as well really, because reports this morning suggesting that Roberto Baggio is on his way to Anfield appear to be wider of the mark than a Vladimir Smicer 'piledriver'. It all started this morning when an Inter official was quoted in the Mirror as saying, \"We are aware of interest in Roberto Baggio from a representative of Liverpool.\" But when asked for their view on events, Liverpool could only manage a dismissive \"we never comment on media speculation\". In fact, latest reports suggest that the representative was Ron Dixon, trying to hire some new cleaning staff for Great Grannies. As for Baggio himself, he is happy in Milan. Despite being bottom of the pecking order at Inter - behind Ronaldo, Christian Vieri, Iain Dowie, and Frank Spencer - the Divine Ponytail notched the winner against Verona on Sunday, his first goal in eight months. \"I believe this is another positive period for me at Inter,\" he said afterwards. \"I hope this is the case because without creativity there is no fun in football.

      "body": "<p>If it's hard telling your partner you've been cheating on him or her, it's a damn sight harder telling the kids. \"It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do,\" says Sally of the moment when she had to break the news to her son and daughter, aged six and seven. \"I felt I was taking away their innocence, stripping them of their childhood.\" </p> <p>According to Julia Cole - whose book, After the Affair, is published this week - affairs hit children as badly as their parents fear. And her conclusions are backed up by a recent survey, which reveals a string of negative effects on children after the disclosure of a parent's affair. </p> <p>According to the survey, by Relate and Candis magazine, more than half the 1,000 respondents believed children would be damaged if one or both of their parents were involved in an affair. Those who had either had affairs, or witnessed them in families they were close to, described three main problems they observed in the children afterwards: becoming withdrawn (35%), a tendency to cry more (31%) and a tendency to aggression (25%). Other problems included truancy from school, eating disorders and running away from home. </p> <p>Even where affairs are supposedly clandestine, or at least hidden from the children, they are rarely completely unaffected, says Cole. \"Children are often far sharper emotionally than adults give them credit for. I've met couples who have described the affair as being like a cancer eating away at the heart of their family - a child will have an awareness of that. </p> <p>\"The way people think of affairs, typically, is of the relationship triangle. But it's more accurate to think of it like a stone being thrown into a pool. The ripples flow out. When a couple have an affair, many others are affected - and those who are affected the worst are their children.\" </p> <p>Occasionally, a child becomes aware of a parent's affair before the other parent. This can be devastating, says Dr Brenda Robson, a psychologist who specialises in family break-ups. \"In this situation children feel very guilty, completely torn. They know it might mean the break-up of their parents marriage, and they don't want that.\" </p> <p>If the marriage does end, the children often blame themselves, even many years on, for not keeping the affair secret - even if they didn't disclose it. \"In fact, it's common for children to blame themselves whether or not they knew what was going on,\" says Cole. \"I've had adult clients who describe a parent's affair, then say, 'I was being very difficult at the time so it's not surprising she had an affair.'\" </p> <p>There's guilt, too, on the part of the philanderer. Five years on, Sally - who, after separating from her husband, went back to live with him - still feels bad about the effect of her affair on her children. \"In many ways, we're the family we always were. But underneath the appearances I think it has changed all of us,\" she says. \"Maybe it's just my guilt, but I think the children don't have faith in us any more. They still think about the time we split up, and they worry it might happen again.\" </p> <p>Others say you can't separate the affair from everything else that was going on in the relationship. \"Of course, my kids were affected by my affair, and that of my husband. But they were also affected by all the rows, the screaming, the terrible atmosphere,\" says Sue. \"It was a whole package of disasters.\" </p> <p>Given this, isn't it understandable if unhappily married parents think an affair may be a way of squaring the circle - allowing them a snatch of happiness, while enabling the family to remain together? Cole understands this, but counsels against it. Far better, she says, to try to put the original relationship back on track than to think it can co-exist alongside an affair. \"A lot of the people I see say, in talking about an affair, that they could see it coming,\" she says. \"They see that, looking back, they were open to the idea. If you feel that you've got to think, 'Why?' You need to get some professional help to sort out what is going wrong. You need to talk to your partner. </p> <p>\"The idea of saving your children the agony of the marriage splitting up by taking a lover sounds attractive, but all you're doing is opening the way to further difficulty, because you're letting in this new factor, the lover. And also, I'd say, you're not treating this new person at all well - you're simply using him, or her, to keep your relationship intact and your family together. It's not a fair way of dealing with the problem.\" </p> <p>Some couples, of course, patch things up after an affair. But, says Cole, doing this for the sake of the children isn't a good enough reason. There has, she says, to be at least a spark of love, as illustrated by this respondent in the Relate survey: \"It [the affair and its aftermath] has devastated my life,\" the respondent wrote. \"All my values are shattered. Yet I'm hanging on in there for the sake of the children. Who wants to be a single mum? And the boys need a dad. But my idea of a partnership for life has gone, and love flew out of the window a long time ago.\" </p> <p>And it is not only the cuckolded who suffer. Richard, 53, had an affair when his three children were in their early teens. \"My marriage was in pieces. There was nothing left except animosity,\" he says. \"Sarah, my lover, was the love of my life.\" After weeks of agonising - \"I genuinely wanted to do what was best for the children\" - Richard decided to move out to live with Sarah. \"I knew my wife and I could never put our marriage together again, and I thought the children would suffer living with all our rows.\" </p> <p>What Richard hadn't reckoned with, though, was the attitude of one of his daughters. \"She absolutely hated Sarah and made life difficult for us all the time. In the end, Sarah couldn't stand it any longer, and she left. I know if it hadn't been for my daughter we'd still be together, and I know I'm unhappy because of her. But the truth is, looking back, that I can also see that, from Sarah's point of view, I let her down because I was always putting the children first.\" </p> <p>Others leave initially, but return when they realise not only how much their children need their other parent, but how inadequate their new partner is: \"As a lover, life was great. We got on really well, I loved him,\" says Jane. \"But when we started living together, with my daughter there too, I realised he wasn't very good at being a father-substitute.

      "bodyText": "If it's hard telling your partner you've been cheating on him or her, it's a damn sight harder telling the kids. \"It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do,\" says Sally of the moment when she had to break the news to her son and daughter, aged six and seven. \"I felt I was taking away their innocence, stripping them of their childhood.\" According to Julia Cole - whose book, After the Affair, is published this week - affairs hit children as badly as their parents fear. And her conclusions are backed up by a recent survey, which reveals a string of negative effects on children after the disclosure of a parent's affair. According to the survey, by Relate and Candis magazine, more than half the 1,000 respondents believed children would be damaged if one or both of their parents were involved in an affair. Those who had either had affairs, or witnessed them in families they were close to, described three main problems they observed in the children afterwards: becoming withdrawn (35%), a tendency to cry more (31%) and a tendency to aggression (25%). Other problems included truancy from school, eating disorders and running away from home. Even where affairs are supposedly clandestine, or at least hidden from the children, they are rarely completely unaffected, says Cole. \"Children are often far sharper emotionally than adults give them credit for. I've met couples who have described the affair as being like a cancer eating away at the heart of their family - a child will have an awareness of that. \"The way people think of affairs, typically, is of the relationship triangle. But it's more accurate to think of it like a stone being thrown into a pool. The ripples flow out. When a couple have an affair, many others are affected - and those who are affected the worst are their children.\" Occasionally, a child becomes aware of a parent's affair before the other parent. This can be devastating, says Dr Brenda Robson, a psychologist who specialises in family break-ups. \"In this situation children feel very guilty, completely torn. They know it might mean the break-up of their parents marriage, and they don't want that.\" If the marriage does end, the children often blame themselves, even many years on, for not keeping the affair secret - even if they didn't disclose it. \"In fact, it's common for children to blame themselves whether or not they knew what was going on,\" says Cole. \"I've had adult clients who describe a parent's affair, then say, 'I was being very difficult at the time so it's not surprising she had an affair.'\" There's guilt, too, on the part of the philanderer. Five years on, Sally - who, after separating from her husband, went back to live with him - still feels bad about the effect of her affair on her children. \"In many ways, we're the family we always were. But underneath the appearances I think it has changed all of us,\" she says. \"Maybe it's just my guilt, but I think the children don't have faith in us any more. They still think about the time we split up, and they worry it might happen again.\" Others say you can't separate the affair from everything else that was going on in the relationship. \"Of course, my kids were affected by my affair, and that of my husband. But they were also affected by all the rows, the screaming, the terrible atmosphere,\" says Sue. \"It was a whole package of disasters.\" Given this, isn't it understandable if unhappily married parents think an affair may be a way of squaring the circle - allowing them a snatch of happiness, while enabling the family to remain together? Cole understands this, but counsels against it. Far better, she says, to try to put the original relationship back on track than to think it can co-exist alongside an affair. \"A lot of the people I see say, in talking about an affair, that they could see it coming,\" she says. \"They see that, looking back, they were open to the idea. If you feel that you've got to think, 'Why?' You need to get some professional help to sort out what is going wrong. You need to talk to your partner. \"The idea of saving your children the agony of the marriage splitting up by taking a lover sounds attractive, but all you're doing is opening the way to further difficulty, because you're letting in this new factor, the lover. And also, I'd say, you're not treating this new person at all well - you're simply using him, or her, to keep your relationship intact and your family together. It's not a fair way of dealing with the problem.\" Some couples, of course, patch things up after an affair. But, says Cole, doing this for the sake of the children isn't a good enough reason. There has, she says, to be at least a spark of love, as illustrated by this respondent in the Relate survey: \"It [the affair and its aftermath] has devastated my life,\" the respondent wrote. \"All my values are shattered. Yet I'm hanging on in there for the sake of the children. Who wants to be a single mum? And the boys need a dad. But my idea of a partnership for life has gone, and love flew out of the window a long time ago.\" And it is not only the cuckolded who suffer. Richard, 53, had an affair when his three children were in their early teens. \"My marriage was in pieces. There was nothing left except animosity,\" he says. \"Sarah, my lover, was the love of my life.\" After weeks of agonising - \"I genuinely wanted to do what was best for the children\" - Richard decided to move out to live with Sarah. \"I knew my wife and I could never put our marriage together again, and I thought the children would suffer living with all our rows.\" What Richard hadn't reckoned with, though, was the attitude of one of his daughters. \"She absolutely hated Sarah and made life difficult for us all the time. In the end, Sarah couldn't stand it any longer, and she left. I know if it hadn't been for my daughter we'd still be together, and I know I'm unhappy because of her. But the truth is, looking back, that I can also see that, from Sarah's point of view, I let her down because I was always putting the children first.\" Others leave initially, but return when they realise not only how much their children need their other parent, but how inadequate their new partner is: \"As a lover, life was great. We got on really well, I loved him,\" says Jane. \"But when we started living together, with my daughter there too, I realised he wasn't very good at being a father-substitute. He just wasn't interested in what she was doing, in the little person she is. In the end, it was enough to end the relationship, and I went home.\" When the old relationship still has a spark, says Cole, the presence of children can provide an extra boost to a couple wanting to put things back together again. But, she cautions, there's no such thing as going back after an affair: you can rebuild a relationship, but you can never rebuild exactly the relationship you had. But from the point of view of the children, there's little doubt that the relationship rebuilt is a good deal preferable to no relationship at all. \u0095 Names have been changed.

My father had put me and my little brother to bed. I always read my comics in bed and was used to getting a 10-minute reprieve after \"lights out, night night\". But this particular night he didn't come back to switch my bedside lamp off. After half an hour I put it down to his normal absent-mindedness and switched the light off myself. The next morning my life changed irrevocably. My mother shook when she held me on her lap and told me my father was never coming back.

In our society an old father is still thought of as an amazingly virile man. I tell my peers about my father and the male ones, especially, react with undisguised admiration. Think of how many years you can play the field before having to settle down! But I wonder, has Bellow really thought it through? And did my father? </p> <p>I remember the kind kindergarten ladies telling me that my granddad had arrived to pick me up. I'd be indignant, furious. He was my father, couldn't they tell? Well, probably not. His shock of white hair, his kind, worn face, and his deep smile lines probably confused them. Like any seven-year-old, I would be petulant when my father refused to take part in my active games. Was he really too frail, too old, as he said - or just not interested? I have a vivid memory of him pouring orange juice on his cornflakes by mistake. I regarded this absent-minded clumsiness as a personality trait, but now I wonder - how much of it was simply the behaviour of an old man? </p> <p>He was also an incredibly intelligent person. He was witty, had a hugely positive outlook on life and was prodigiously gifted. But I never got to know that. I just have to second-guess from what people tell me. </p> <p>I never knew my grandparents on his side. When I was born they'd died years ago. Even if my father had lived a little longer, there is a whole family, a whole world, my younger brother and I will never know. Apparently I look like his mother. The one photograph we have tells me nothing. What was she like? Would we have got on? Where do I fit in, what have I inherited, what haven't I, where is my father hidden inside me? </p> <p>I do have family on his side, though. His daughters, born to him during his first marriage, before the second world war. They're my sisters, but they're older than my mother, so they feel more like aunts. </p> <p>My father got a second go at parenthood with myself and my brother. First time around, I've been told, he was distant and strict. He didn't waste it this time. He watched us grow and enjoyed our company until the day he died. He was truly patient, gentle and giving, unlike many first-time fathers of a younger age. I only remember being told off once. I had disturbed the news on television just once too many times. An old man likes his news. </p> <p>They say the older the parent, the more intelligent the child. I don't know about that, but I do know that I have suffered from a lack of guidance. Dad's not here to advise me. Lately, when I've been worried about what direction my career is taking, when I've wanted a second opinion, there has been nobody to ask. Would he have been disappointed that I didn't choose classical music as a career? Reassurance from my mother doesn't feel enough. It's frustrating knowing that your father knew so much yet you will never know the half of it. </p> <p>Had he lived to 90, I would have still been just 22 when he died. And by then there might not have been much \"daddy\" left. How many 90-year-olds do you know who're completely cogent? How is a child supposed to relate to somebody always frail, always about to die? </p> <p>I used to get angry about it. I'd ask myself, did it ever occur to my parents before they had me, that it was bound to end like this? Whether at seven or 17, I was bound to lose my father at a young age. Was it fair of them? </p> <p>But they were in love, and love is blind. Like all lovers they probably felt they could overcome anything and everything. They didn't think too far ahead. And as my mother still says: \"Look at your granddad. He's had three strokes and he's still alive at 84.\" She's got uncles that are up and at it, despite being in their 90s. She never thought of my father as an \"old\" man. He was active, totally \"with it\" and full of positive energy. There is no point being angry. </p> <p>Of course, everybody's dad might die at any time, but mine must have known he was going to die before I grew up. I don't regret what my mother and father chose to do. I just wish I'd had the chance to know my father better. His amazing life. A well-known conductor, he wrote extensively about classical music in the Norwegian press and was an ardent promoter of music among young people. How many younger fathers can boast a career which saw him take a little known orchestra in Oslo and pretty much shape it into today's world-class Oslo Philharmonic? A Jewish Hamburg-born boy, he escaped Nazi Germany before the war started, made a life for himself in Norway. </p> <p>He lost much of his family and most of his inheritance. But he never lost his lust for life. And he gave life - my brother and myself and my two half-sisters live on. I'll always have that to thank him for. And we haven't turned out too badly, considering. I just wish he knew that.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When my son was a toddler his first question about a meal was always: \"What's for dessert?\" One day, we had pineapple in kirsch. He spat it out, then looked at the grown-ups devouring the stuff, and said: \"Pineapple: it's yucky for me but it's yummy for you.\" For weeks afterwards, he would stop suddenly in the middle of a game and say, \"Pineapple: yucky for me but yummy for you\", as if he had discovered the most extraordinary fact of life. And in a sense he had: the realisation that people think and feel differently is a profound one. </p> <p>When we look around a room full of people, we don't see bags of skin and cloth draped over the furniture. We see other people, people with thoughts and emotions, desires and beliefs, sometimes like our own, sometimes not. And by the time they are 18 months old, this is what toddlers see, too. But how do such tiny children get from bags of skin to \"other minds\"? </p> <p>In the past 30 years, we have learned more about what young children know and how they learn than we did in the preceding 2,500 years. And this has revolutionised our view of children. For centuries, psychologists and philosophers agreed that babies were the opposite of adults. They were emotional and passive, dominated by perception and incapable of rational thought. John Locke said they were \"blank slates\", William James thought their lives \"a buzzing, blooming confusion\". </p> <p>Today, scientists have only recently begun to appreciate just how much even the youngest babies know - and how much and how quickly they learn. There are three elements to this new picture. First, that children know a great deal, literally from the moment they are born. Second, that they are born with extremely powerful learning abilities, more powerful than the most sophisticated computer. And, finally, that grown-ups appear to be \"programmed\" to unconsciously teach babies and young children just the things they need to know. </p> <p>In How Babies Think, my co-authors and I argue that very young children use the same strategies as scientists. They think, observe, formulate theories, make predictions, and do experiments. They also change their theories as they accumulate counter-evidence to their predictions. </p> <p>But where scientists focus their attention on distant stars and invisible microbes, babies concentrate on everyday things: blocks, pet dogs, words and, most important, Mum and Dad and Aunt Ethel. In fact, understanding other people seems to be one of the most crucial items in the scientific agenda of childhood, and it's a good illustration of how early learning takes place. </p> <p>To begin with, children are born knowing that people are special. Newborn babies (the youngest tested was only 42 minutes old) can imitate facial expressions. There are no mirrors in the womb; newborns have never seen their own face. These tiny babies must somehow already understand the similarity between their own internal feeling (of, say, sticking out their tongue) and the external face they see (a round shape from which something pink protudes). Newborn babies not only prefer faces to things - this we've known for years - but also recognise that those faces are like their own face. Nature, it seems, gives human beings a jump start on the Other Minds problem. </p> <p>And what a jump start. By the time they are nine months old, babies can tell the difference between expressions of happiness, sadness and anger, and understand something about the emotions that produce those expressions. By the time they are one, they know that they will see something by looking where other people point; they know that they should do something by watching what others do; and they know how they should feel about something by seeing how others feel. For instance, a grown-up can look in two boxes. She looks into one with an expression of joy and into the other with disgust. The baby will happily reach into the box that made her happy, but won't touch the box that disgusted her. The baby has discovered that its initial emotional rapport with other people extends to joint attitudes towards the world. In a simple way, one-year-olds already participate in a culture. But as babies learn that people usually have the same attitudes towards objects as they do, they are setting themselves up to learn something else, something more disturbing: they discover that sometimes people don't have the same attitudes. </p> <p>Observe what happens when a baby reaches for a forbidden object - a lamp cord, say. It must seem perverse to the one-year-old: the more clearly she indicates her desire, the more adamantly her carer keeps it away. Even though the baby and the grown-up are reacting to the same object, their attitudes toward the object seem to be different. </p> <p>By the time babies are about one and a half, they start to understand the nature of these differences between people and become fascinated. If you offer a baby two bowls, one of biscuits, the other of raw broccoli, all the babies prefer the biscuits. But if the researcher indicates to the baby that she hates biscuits and loves broccoli, then hands the bowls to the baby and says, \"Could you give me some?\" something interesting happens. Fourteen-month-olds, with their innocent assumption that we all want the same thing, give her biscuits. But the wiser 18-month-olds give her broccoli, even though they themselves despise it. These tiny children have learned that other people's desires may conflict with their own. </p> <p>This is also dramatically apparent in everyday life. Parents all know, and dread, the \"terrible twos\". While one-year-olds seem irresistibly drawn to forbidden objects (that lamp cord again), the two-year-olds seem deliberately bloody-minded. She doesn't even look at the lamp cord. Instead, her hand goes out to touch it as she looks, steadily, gravely, at you. </p> <p>This demonic behaviour is quite rational, though. Our broccoli experiments show that children only begin to understand differences in desires at 18 months. The terrible twos seem to involve a systematic exploration of that idea, like an experimental research programme. Toddlers are testing the extent to which their desires and those of others may conflict. The grave look is directed at you because you and your reaction, rather than the lamp cord, are the interesting thing. The terrible twos reflect a clash between children's need to understand other people and their need to live happily with them. If the child is a budding scientist, we parents are the laboratory rats. </p> <p>Two-year-olds have to learn how visual perception works, too. Toddlers love hide and seek but aren't very good at it - a toddler will bury his head under the table with his bottom in view. In our lab, we explored when children learn how to hide things. Suppose I put a child on one side of a table and sit on the other. Then I put a screen and a toy on the table and ask the child to hide the toy from me. At 24 months, a toddler will put the toy on my side of the screen, so that it is actually hidden from them, but not from me. But 36-month-olds get this right. In fact, they'll often tell me they can see the toy but I can't. In the months in between, we observed many children experimenting. They would switch the toy from one side to the other, or come around to my side of the screen to make sure the toy really was hidden. </p> <p>But this isn't the end of the story. Three-year-olds still have trouble with another important fact about people. They know that we can see different things, but not that what we think about the world may be wrong. They don't know that I may think I hear a burglar in the yard when really it's just a racoon. </p> <p>In a classic experiment, you can give three-year-olds a shut chocolate box. They open it and it turns out to have pencils inside. Then you ask them about another child in the nursery: \"What will Nicky think is in the box: pencils or chocolates?\" Three-year-olds report that Nicky will say there are pencils inside. They don't understand that Nicky will probably make the same mistake they made. Four-year-olds know that Nicky will be misled by the picture on the box. </p> <p>Like scientists, children change their theories precisely because they make the wrong predictions. In \"mistaken belief\" experiments, simply telling children the right answer makes no difference. Like scientists, children at first resist counter-evidence. Virginia Slaughter and I visited three-year-olds over several weeks and gave them examples of mistaken beliefs: a golfball that turned out to be soap, a yellow duck that looked green when put behind blue plastic. Each time the child made the wrong prediction, we presented them with counter-evidence. After two weeks, these three-year-olds understood a brand new \"mistaken belief\" task, one they had never seen before, much better than a control group. </p> <p>This experiment shows that even very young children are naturally able to alter their predictions in the light of new evidence. But it also shows how important other people can be: our adult behaviour had helped the children to work out the correct answer. Of course, we're developmental psychologists. Do grown-ups naturally help children learn in their everyday lives? The new research suggests they do. One of the most dramatic examples of this is the funny sing-song voice grown-ups use when they talk to young babies. This rather embarrassing speech style helps children sort out the sounds of language. Similarly, the way that parents talk about the mind seems to influence their children's everyday psychology. </p> <p>What are the consequences of this new view? The research doesn't mean there is some set of flashcards that will help babies be brighter. Babies are already as bright as can be. They learn through everyday play, and through the care and attention of grown-ups around them. It also doesn't mean there is some \"critical period\" for learning in the first three years or some set of experiences children must have. Children and even adults keep learning throughout life. It definitely doesn't mean mothers should quit their jobs. Anyone who cares for small children and is sensitive to what interests them can teach them what they need to know. </p> <p>On the other hand, the research does suggest that the everyday, unrenumerated, unremarkable work of caring for babies and young children is the most important work in the world. Humans have managed to learn so much because generations of grown-ups put effort into caring for children. Ironically, this new scientific perspective comes when young children and parents are under enormous pressure. We still penalise parents for taking time off work to be with their children, instead of rewarding them. Childcare workers get little pay and less respect. Most parents face agonising dilemmas as they balance jobs and children. If we really want babies to learn, we should ditch the videotapes and flashcards and work for paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements and publicly supported, high-quality childcare. </p> <p><strong>How tiny minds tick</strong></p> <p><strong> At birth</strong> <br>Babies imitate different facial expressions; know that a happy tone of voice goes with a smile. </p> <p><strong> At 3 months</strong> <br>They understand cause and effect. Tie one end of a ribbon to their toe and the other to a mobile; they learn to move the mobile. </p> <p><strong> At 5 months</strong> <br>Babies can lipread simple vowels. They can match silent video footage of talking faces with the right sound. </p> <p><strong> At 6 months</strong> <br>Babies understand objects. Given a can which moos, they will test it for other unexpected behaviour.</p> <p><strong> At 9 months</strong> Babies know general rules about their language. They can distinguish English from Polish. </p> <p><strong> At 1 year</strong> <br>Babies point, and look to where others point - this implies an understanding of how others see and think. </p> <p><strong> At 18 months</strong> <br>Younger babies assume everyone feels the same as them. Now they know that people may have different desires. </p> <p><strong> At 2 years</strong> <br>Little babies cry when others cry, but by 2, they will provide comfort. Empathy requires a deep knowledge of other minds. </p> <p>\u0095 Alison Gopnik is professor of psychology at the University of California and co-author of How Babies Think: The Science of Childhood, with Andrew Meltzoff and Patricia Kuhl, published this week by Weidenfield and Nicolson at \u00a320.

In our lab, we explored when children learn how to hide things. Suppose I put a child on one side of a table and sit on the other. Then I put a screen and a toy on the table and ask the child to hide the toy from me. At 24 months, a toddler will put the toy on my side of the screen, so that it is actually hidden from them, but not from me. But 36-month-olds get this right. In fact, they'll often tell me they can see the toy but I can't. In the months in between, we observed many children experimenting. They would switch the toy from one side to the other, or come around to my side of the screen to make sure the toy really was hidden. But this isn't the end of the story. Three-year-olds still have trouble with another important fact about people. They know that we can see different things, but not that what we think about the world may be wrong. They don't know that I may think I hear a burglar in the yard when really it's just a racoon. In a classic experiment, you can give three-year-olds a shut chocolate box. They open it and it turns out to have pencils inside. Then you ask them about another child in the nursery: \"What will Nicky think is in the box: pencils or chocolates?\" Three-year-olds report that Nicky will say there are pencils inside. They don't understand that Nicky will probably make the same mistake they made. Four-year-olds know that Nicky will be misled by the picture on the box. Like scientists, children change their theories precisely because they make the wrong predictions. In \"mistaken belief\" experiments, simply telling children the right answer makes no difference. Like scientists, children at first resist counter-evidence. Virginia Slaughter and I visited three-year-olds over several weeks and gave them examples of mistaken beliefs: a golfball that turned out to be soap, a yellow duck that looked green when put behind blue plastic. Each time the child made the wrong prediction, we presented them with counter-evidence. After two weeks, these three-year-olds understood a brand new \"mistaken belief\" task, one they had never seen before, much better than a control group. This experiment shows that even very young children are naturally able to alter their predictions in the light of new evidence. But it also shows how important other people can be: our adult behaviour had helped the children to work out the correct answer. Of course, we're developmental psychologists. Do grown-ups naturally help children learn in their everyday lives? The new research suggests they do. One of the most dramatic examples of this is the funny sing-song voice grown-ups use when they talk to young babies. This rather embarrassing speech style helps children sort out the sounds of language. Similarly, the way that parents talk about the mind seems to influence their children's everyday psychology. What are the consequences of this new view? The research doesn't mean there is some set of flashcards that will help babies be brighter. Babies are already as bright as can be. They learn through everyday play, and through the care and attention of grown-ups around them. It also doesn't mean there is some \"critical period\" for learning in the first three years or some set of experiences children must have. Children and even adults keep learning throughout life. It definitely doesn't mean mothers should quit their jobs. Anyone who cares for small children and is sensitive to what interests them can teach them what they need to know. On the other hand, the research does suggest that the everyday, unrenumerated, unremarkable work of caring for babies and young children is the most important work in the world. Humans have managed to learn so much because generations of grown-ups put effort into caring for children. Ironically, this new scientific perspective comes when young children and parents are under enormous pressure. We still penalise parents for taking time off work to be with their children, instead of rewarding them. Childcare workers get little pay and less respect. Most parents face agonising dilemmas as they balance jobs and children. If we really want babies to learn, we should ditch the videotapes and flashcards and work for paid parental leave, flexible work arrangements and publicly supported, high-quality childcare. How tiny minds tick At birth Babies imitate different facial expressions; know that a happy tone of voice goes with a smile. At 3 months They understand cause and effect. Tie one end of a ribbon to their toe and the other to a mobile; they learn to move the mobile. At 5 months Babies can lipread simple vowels. They can match silent video footage of talking faces with the right sound. At 6 months Babies understand objects. Given a can which moos, they will test it for other unexpected behaviour. At 9 months Babies know general rules about their language. They can distinguish English from Polish. At 1 year Babies point, and look to where others point - this implies an understanding of how others see and think. At 18 months Younger babies assume everyone feels the same as them. Now they know that people may have different desires. At 2 years Little babies cry when others cry, but by 2, they will provide comfort. Empathy requires a deep knowledge of other minds. \u0095 Alison Gopnik is professor of psychology at the University of California and co-author of How Babies Think: The Science of Childhood, with Andrew Meltzoff and Patricia Kuhl, published this week by Weidenfield and Nicolson at \u00a320.

      "body": "<p>Europe's most heavily armed police are dressed from head to foot in black, the visors of their riot helmets down, ready for any form of attack. They carry rifles and have grenades and gas masks dangling below their body armour. In self-defence, they can use the 30mm rapid fire naval cannon or, at close quarters, shotguns. </p> <p> This the elite cadre of the UK Atomic Energy Authority security force, Britain's least known police unit. They were trained and armed for a very particular task: to sail round the world in their double-hulled gunboats to deliver nuclear fuel to Japan. </p> <p> Now they are back on the Cumbrian coast near their base at Sellafield, kicking their heels and awaiting a highly embarrassing order: to return to Japan and collect the fuel they have just delivered - a round trip of 40,000 miles. </p> <p> The UKAEA security force is a pawn in a debacle that has brought Britain's nuclear industry to a new low. Last Wednesday, Kansai Electric Power Co Inc - the first company in the world to accept a shipment of reprocessed mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel from British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) - announced it was to bar BNFL from supplying it. In a statement, Kansai said that BNFL's falsification of data relating to safety of records had seriously damaged public trust. Japan has now demanded that the shipment be taken back. </p> <p> So the government has ordered a high-level delegation - including Anna Walker, director general of energy at the DTI, and Lawrence Williams, chief inspector of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate - to fly to Japan to try to talk the Japanese government round. </p> <p> The delegation's task is a difficult one and, even if it succeeds, there are serious questions to be answered about how BNFL came to spend hundreds of millions of pounds of public money on a disastrous plan to reprocess the world's plutonium, without consulting the public about what it was doing. </p> <p> Mixed-oxide fuel was to be the salvation of the spent nuclear fuel industry based at Sellafield. MOX is a mixture of uranium and plutonium. It is not the sort of thing you can put in the post, return to sender: it is easily dissolved in acid and convertible into nuclear weapons, hence the extraordinary security measures demanded to escort it round the world. Nine thousand jobs depend on chopping up hot, used fuel, dissolving it in nitric acid and turning it into plutonium and uranium. </p> <p> In the midst of the huge Sellafield complex is one of the most hi-tech industrial plants the world has seen. It cost pounds 300m and is the last word in robotics, with every speck of dust accounted for to make sure no plutonium goes astray. But it has been lying idle for two years while the government decides whether it should be dismantled before it is ever used. </p> <p> By law, BNFL has to justify the extra nuclear contamination that opening the plant would cause by showing it is economically justifiable. Before the latest debacle, many thought this was unlikely and were willing to challenge any permission in the courts. Now it looks plain impossible. </p> <p> The plant was built by BNFL with taxpayers' money, but without publicising what they were doing. The idea was to reprocess plutonium and uranium by making MOX fuel to be sold overseas. This would justify the continued existence of giant reprocessing plants for producing plutonium that no one otherwise needs or wants. The reprocessing system was developed in the dim days at the beginning of the cold war, when Britain urgently needed plutonium to make hydrogen bombs and keep its place as a world power. All that was 50 years and another century ago now, and the few pounds of plutonium that were needed to make the first nuclear weapons has become an embarrassing mountain of 40 tonnes - enough to obliterate all human life in the world around 100,000 times. </p> <p> Every day we go on making more and more plutonium. Although the UK does not need it, it is not the sort of thing that can be let out of sight. For a start, it is the world's most toxic substance - a speck of dust in the lungs can cause cancer. It is also the substance every terrorist and dictator in the world would like to get his hands on. It is the most desired and most undesirable commodity on the planet. </p> <p> So BNFL had a problem. What was it going to do with a growing stockpile of plutonium it could not use? It fell back on a technology developed years before but abandoned as too expensive and potentially dangerous. It would mix plutonium with uranium and make a new fuel called MOX, which could be burnt in traditional reactors. </p> <p> BNFL went ahead and built the Sellafield MOX factory, on the basis that it was sure it would be able to sell the fuel to Germany and Japan. The reason for BNFL's optimism lay in the aftermath of the second world war. The two defeated countries were never to be allowed to become nuclear weapons states. Rather inconveniently, though, they own large quantities of plutonium. This is stored at Sellafield, where both these countries have sent their spent fuel for reprocessing. </p> <p> Under contracts signed 30 years ago between these two countries and the UK, they have to have their plutonium back, but they cannot have it in a raw metal form from which they could make nuclear bombs. They have to have it as fuel for peaceful purposes. </p> <p> In the 1970s, the idea was to use the plutonium in a new generation of nuclear reactors called fast breeders, which used large quantities of it and neatly got rid of the stockpile, but this was a technology that could not be made to work. It meant Germany and Japan were left with large quantities of plutonium they had no use for, had to have returned, but were not allowed to receive because of the legacy of the last world war. </p> <p> In a desperate search for a solution, both sides fixed on MOX as the way out of the dilemma. Even though it was far more expensive than conventional uranium fuel, it was a way of using the plutonium that no one really wanted. </p> <p> So, without anyone really noticing, MOX fuel became the solution to the plutonium mountain. A so-called demonstration plant was built at Sellafield to prove it would work and the Swiss, who also have a surplus plutonium problem, but are famously neutral so do not need a bomb, were the pioneers in trying it out in their reactors. </p> <p> The fuss began when the first shipment of demonstration MOX was to go to Japan. The US refused point blank to allow the risk of MOX being flown to Japan. The US has a veto because the uranium from which the Japanese plutonium originates comes under American proliferation safeguards. </p> <p> In order to avoid the world's most frightening substance falling into the wrong hands, the US demanded that two armed ships were required to carry it round the world. This meant hiring a warship from the British navy, or a gunboat from the Japanese, making MOX even more expensive. </p> <p> But BNFL hit on another idea. The company would take its two specially built nuclear transports and convert them into gunboats. Three of the latest 30mm naval guns would be bolted on to each ship and two groups of police would be specially trained to use them and a multitude of other weapons needed to repel any kind of attack. All levels of defence were considered and included - even water cannon, needed to repel softer targets such as Greenpeace. </p> <p> After months of preparation and increasing anger from Caribbean and other nations that might be endangered by the passing convoy, the two gunboats set sail from Sellafield. To avoid diplomatic protests and a possible blockade of the Panama canal, the ships went via the Cape of Good Hope, through the Pacific to Japan. </p> <p> Landfall was not possible in all that time because none of the nations en route would welcome the ships. One of the policemen on board, who took a tumble in rough seas, had to be airlifted to hospital in Australia at the furthest distance the helicopter could fly to avoid the ships coming to port. </p> <p> There was a sigh of relief from BNFL when the fuel arrived unscathed and, despite protests, the Kansai Nuclear Company decided to load the fuel into its Takahama reactors. A few days later, the scandal of the falsified safety checks broke in Britain. BNFL began an urgent damage limitation exercise, reassuring the Japanese that the fuel sent to them was unaffected by the false documentation, that the fuel concerned was still at Sellafield. </p> <p> In the wake of Japan's worst ever nuclear accident at the Tokaimura plant, when, in a totally unrelated incident, three workers were badly hurt and thousands evacuated, feelings were running high. When documents from the British nuclear installations inspectorate were uncovered confirming that some of the Japanese consignment was suspect, the dam burst. Kansai rejected the BNFL fuel and said the MOX would never be loaded into its reactors. </p> <p> Perhaps worst of all for BNFL, the Japanese government said it had lost faith in the company. This leaves a terrible mess. The mothballed plant can't open until it gets firm orders, BNFL is horrified at the PR disaster of having to bring the fuel back, and the whole future of Sellafield is in disarray. If MOX is the only remaining justification for reprocessing spent fuel, what happens now?</p>",

So the government has ordered a high-level delegation - including Anna Walker, director general of energy at the DTI, and Lawrence Williams, chief inspector of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate - to fly to Japan to try to talk the Japanese government round. The delegation's task is a difficult one and, even if it succeeds, there are serious questions to be answered about how BNFL came to spend hundreds of millions of pounds of public money on a disastrous plan to reprocess the world's plutonium, without consulting the public about what it was doing. Mixed-oxide fuel was to be the salvation of the spent nuclear fuel industry based at Sellafield. MOX is a mixture of uranium and plutonium. It is not the sort of thing you can put in the post, return to sender: it is easily dissolved in acid and convertible into nuclear weapons, hence the extraordinary security measures demanded to escort it round the world. Nine thousand jobs depend on chopping up hot, used fuel, dissolving it in nitric acid and turning it into plutonium and uranium. In the midst of the huge Sellafield complex is one of the most hi-tech industrial plants the world has seen. It cost pounds 300m and is the last word in robotics, with every speck of dust accounted for to make sure no plutonium goes astray. But it has been lying idle for two years while the government decides whether it should be dismantled before it is ever used. By law, BNFL has to justify the extra nuclear contamination that opening the plant would cause by showing it is economically justifiable. Before the latest debacle, many thought this was unlikely and were willing to challenge any permission in the courts. Now it looks plain impossible. The plant was built by BNFL with taxpayers' money, but without publicising what they were doing. The idea was to reprocess plutonium and uranium by making MOX fuel to be sold overseas. This would justify the continued existence of giant reprocessing plants for producing plutonium that no one otherwise needs or wants. The reprocessing system was developed in the dim days at the beginning of the cold war, when Britain urgently needed plutonium to make hydrogen bombs and keep its place as a world power. All that was 50 years and another century ago now, and the few pounds of plutonium that were needed to make the first nuclear weapons has become an embarrassing mountain of 40 tonnes - enough to obliterate all human life in the world around 100,000 times. Every day we go on making more and more plutonium. Although the UK does not need it, it is not the sort of thing that can be let out of sight. For a start, it is the world's most toxic substance - a speck of dust in the lungs can cause cancer. It is also the substance every terrorist and dictator in the world would like to get his hands on. It is the most desired and most undesirable commodity on the planet. So BNFL had a problem. What was it going to do with a growing stockpile of plutonium it could not use? It fell back on a technology developed years before but abandoned as too expensive and potentially dangerous. It would mix plutonium with uranium and make a new fuel called MOX, which could be burnt in traditional reactors. BNFL went ahead and built the Sellafield MOX factory, on the basis that it was sure it would be able to sell the fuel to Germany and Japan. The reason for BNFL's optimism lay in the aftermath of the second world war. The two defeated countries were never to be allowed to become nuclear weapons states. Rather inconveniently, though, they own large quantities of plutonium. This is stored at Sellafield, where both these countries have sent their spent fuel for reprocessing. Under contracts signed 30 years ago between these two countries and the UK, they have to have their plutonium back, but they cannot have it in a raw metal form from which they could make nuclear bombs. They have to have it as fuel for peaceful purposes. In the 1970s, the idea was to use the plutonium in a new generation of nuclear reactors called fast breeders, which used large quantities of it and neatly got rid of the stockpile, but this was a technology that could not be made to work. It meant Germany and Japan were left with large quantities of plutonium they had no use for, had to have returned, but were not allowed to receive because of the legacy of the last world war. In a desperate search for a solution, both sides fixed on MOX as the way out of the dilemma. Even though it was far more expensive than conventional uranium fuel, it was a way of using the plutonium that no one really wanted. So, without anyone really noticing, MOX fuel became the solution to the plutonium mountain. A so-called demonstration plant was built at Sellafield to prove it would work and the Swiss, who also have a surplus plutonium problem, but are famously neutral so do not need a bomb, were the pioneers in trying it out in their reactors. The fuss began when the first shipment of demonstration MOX was to go to Japan. The US refused point blank to allow the risk of MOX being flown to Japan. The US has a veto because the uranium from which the Japanese plutonium originates comes under American proliferation safeguards. In order to avoid the world's most frightening substance falling into the wrong hands, the US demanded that two armed ships were required to carry it round the world. This meant hiring a warship from the British navy, or a gunboat from the Japanese, making MOX even more expensive. But BNFL hit on another idea. The company would take its two specially built nuclear transports and convert them into gunboats. Three of the latest 30mm naval guns would be bolted on to each ship and two groups of police would be specially trained to use them and a multitude of other weapons needed to repel any kind of attack. All levels of defence were considered and included - even water cannon, needed to repel softer targets such as Greenpeace. After months of preparation and increasing anger from Caribbean and other nations that might be endangered by the passing convoy, the two gunboats set sail from Sellafield. To avoid diplomatic protests and a possible blockade of the Panama canal, the ships went via the Cape of Good Hope, through the Pacific to Japan. Landfall was not possible in all that time because none of the nations en route would welcome the ships. One of the policemen on board, who took a tumble in rough seas, had to be airlifted to hospital in Australia at the furthest distance the helicopter could fly to avoid the ships coming to port. There was a sigh of relief from BNFL when the fuel arrived unscathed and, despite protests, the Kansai Nuclear Company decided to load the fuel into its Takahama reactors. A few days later, the scandal of the falsified safety checks broke in Britain. BNFL began an urgent damage limitation exercise, reassuring the Japanese that the fuel sent to them was unaffected by the false documentation, that the fuel concerned was still at Sellafield. In the wake of Japan's worst ever nuclear accident at the Tokaimura plant, when, in a totally unrelated incident, three workers were badly hurt and thousands evacuated, feelings were running high. When documents from the British nuclear installations inspectorate were uncovered confirming that some of the Japanese consignment was suspect, the dam burst. Kansai rejected the BNFL fuel and said the MOX would never be loaded into its reactors. Perhaps worst of all for BNFL, the Japanese government said it had lost faith in the company. This leaves a terrible mess. The mothballed plant can't open until it gets firm orders, BNFL is horrified at the PR disaster of having to bring the fuel back, and the whole future of Sellafield is in disarray. If MOX is the only remaining justification for reprocessing spent fuel, what happens now?",

Her hair has yellowed in the sun. Her wafer-thin skin sags loosely over once proud cheekbones. </p> <p>And who am I?

She baked and laughed and wrote long, entertaining letters. But now she is an agitated stranger plucking at a wad of toilet paper held tightly between plum coloured fingers. </p> <p>Much has changed since my last visit. Sixteen months is a long time when you're in your 80s. Yet, perhaps for my mother, it is no time at all. Days and nights merge into one, punctuated by the comings and goings of others whose lives touch my mother for infinitesimal moments and then are gone. </p> <p>When I last saw her she was confused and lonely. She understood too much about the deterioration taking place in her mind and cried out in despair. She was a woman fighting to resist the ravages of age. It was a battle she could not win. At least she is no longer lonely. Rather, the table is littered with bread rolls with their tissue paper fillings, waiting for a party which will never happen, for friends who will never come. </p> <p>My mother is confused.

The knobs on the cooker have been dismantled and hidden. My mother is now a hazard to herself. Instead, she must rely on others for sustenance. Eight o'clock: it must be Joan (or is it Marion?). The grease on mother's chin has barely time to congeal before the arrival of lunch. The meals-on-wheels lady means well - they all do - but there is no time. She sets the table and pushes the unappetising foil containers towards my mother. \"Eat up,\" she calls cheerily as the door slams behind her, caught by the wind. And some days my mother will open the cartons. She enjoys the desserts. </p> <p>In the fridge is a box of shrivelled mushrooms and a jar of apricot jam. My mother hates apricot jam. I am suddenly enraged that these people, who profess to care for my mother, don't realise that she hates apricot jam. Yet, why should they? Who will tell them? My mother will simply smile, that enigmatic smile which would far outdo the Mona Lisa, and say nothing. Throughout all this my mother sits in her armchair, eyes fixed on a distant patch of green which beckons in the distance. </p> <p>Carers are not the only ones to visit my mother.

I phone my sister, Brenda.\"Don't come back,\" she says firmly. \"What could you do?\" she mutters. I wonder if she is embarrassed? I know that I'm not being fair, but I don't care.

      "body": "<p>For Stephen Shaw, becoming a civil servant after nearly 20 years working for a penal reform charity has been like joining a \"strange brotherhood\". For the past three months he has been adjusting to life as the new prisons ombudsman, after 18 years as the tenacious director of the Prison Reform Trust. </p> <p>While his job of providing prisoners with an independent and effective complaints system holds few terrors - a remit which could be extended to include people on probation under proposed Probation Service reforms - he has yet to feel entirely comfortable with his new working environment. </p> <p>His capacious, central London office is \"a bit of an embarrassment\", and the feeling of being an outsider is strong. Shaw, 46, says: \"For the first few weeks it felt like joining a strange brotherhood, with its own rules, its own formalities and its own codes - most of them unwritten. I was regarded as rather strange for asking for a two-week period shadowing my predecessor, Sir Peter Woodhead, before I officially started, yet that was invaluable. It's just assumed you will pick it up fairly quickly.\" </p> <p>While he may not yet have mastered civil service procedures, the bureaucracy has its upside. \"When you are running a charity, you spend a depressingly large amount of time on administration,\" he says. \"Here, I can focus on the job itself.\" </p> <p>Despite his impersonal office, he doesn't feel cut off from the reality of prison life. \"In 20 years working in the voluntary sector, I didn't reduce the prison population by one,\" he says. \"Now, if I quash an adjudication where a prisoner is serving extra days as a punishment, he can be released in 24 hours, and that is a wonderful feeling.\" </p> <p>Shaw's office receives more than 2,000 complaints a year. However, nearly three-quarters are ineligible for investigation - usually because the prisoners, frustrated at delays in the internal complaints system, have failed to go through the correct procedures. </p> <p>So far, Shaw's impression from the complaints that his office receives is that the Prison Service is \"more careless than callous. The grievances that come to me are not about gross abuses of human rights or physical, mental or racial abuse, but about the minutiae of institutional life.\" </p> <p>Shaw is concerned that the sort of allegations revealed in the Chief Inspector of Prisons' more damning reports do not come to his office. \"Feltham (the young offenders' institution) is arguably the worst prison in the country - though much improved now - and yet we receive fewer than one complaint a year,\" he points out. </p> <p>The top security Whitemoor prison has produced the most complaints - nearly 400 - since the ombudsman's office opened in 1994. Wormwood Scrubs, where inmates' allegations of assaults by prison officers are soon to come to trial, generated 124. </p> <p>The major problem, Shaw says, lies with Prison Service HQ, which is taking six months to review decisions from individual prisons instead of a maximum of six weeks, so clogging up the complaints process. </p> <p>\"The best prisons are not the ones with the fewest complaints,\" he says. \"What I have to do is make my office as relevant to the man serving a week, or to the 16-year-old boy, as it is to the man serving life.\" </p> <p>Come October, Shaw will have to deal with the \"uncharted territory\" of the Human Rights Act, Article 3, for example, outlaws cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. </p> <p>\"Is holding two people in a cell with a single toilet not screened off sufficiently degrading to breach Article 3?\" he wonders. \"If a complaint like that came to me, I would have to go on my own judgment as there is no domestic law to help me. It's a bit frightening, but human rights don't stop at the prison gates. If anything, they are more important inside because of inmates' utter dependence on the state.\" </p> <p>For Shaw, his visits to prisons as ombudsman have provoked a puzzling depth of feeling about the impoverishment of inmates' lives. </p> <p>\"I don't know if it is because, after being so long in the last job, I became deadened to the reality of it all,\" he says. \"I am not an abolitionist - I think prisons are an unfortunate social necessity. But I am surprised at how forcibly the pain of imprisonment has struck me.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "For Stephen Shaw, becoming a civil servant after nearly 20 years working for a penal reform charity has been like joining a \"strange brotherhood\". For the past three months he has been adjusting to life as the new prisons ombudsman, after 18 years as the tenacious director of the Prison Reform Trust. While his job of providing prisoners with an independent and effective complaints system holds few terrors - a remit which could be extended to include people on probation under proposed Probation Service reforms - he has yet to feel entirely comfortable with his new working environment. His capacious, central London office is \"a bit of an embarrassment\", and the feeling of being an outsider is strong. Shaw, 46, says: \"For the first few weeks it felt like joining a strange brotherhood, with its own rules, its own formalities and its own codes - most of them unwritten. I was regarded as rather strange for asking for a two-week period shadowing my predecessor, Sir Peter Woodhead, before I officially started, yet that was invaluable. It's just assumed you will pick it up fairly quickly.\" While he may not yet have mastered civil service procedures, the bureaucracy has its upside. \"When you are running a charity, you spend a depressingly large amount of time on administration,\" he says. \"Here, I can focus on the job itself.\" Despite his impersonal office, he doesn't feel cut off from the reality of prison life. \"In 20 years working in the voluntary sector, I didn't reduce the prison population by one,\" he says. \"Now, if I quash an adjudication where a prisoner is serving extra days as a punishment, he can be released in 24 hours, and that is a wonderful feeling.\" Shaw's office receives more than 2,000 complaints a year. However, nearly three-quarters are ineligible for investigation - usually because the prisoners, frustrated at delays in the internal complaints system, have failed to go through the correct procedures. So far, Shaw's impression from the complaints that his office receives is that the Prison Service is \"more careless than callous. The grievances that come to me are not about gross abuses of human rights or physical, mental or racial abuse, but about the minutiae of institutional life.\" Shaw is concerned that the sort of allegations revealed in the Chief Inspector of Prisons' more damning reports do not come to his office. \"Feltham (the young offenders' institution) is arguably the worst prison in the country - though much improved now - and yet we receive fewer than one complaint a year,\" he points out. The top security Whitemoor prison has produced the most complaints - nearly 400 - since the ombudsman's office opened in 1994. Wormwood Scrubs, where inmates' allegations of assaults by prison officers are soon to come to trial, generated 124. The major problem, Shaw says, lies with Prison Service HQ, which is taking six months to review decisions from individual prisons instead of a maximum of six weeks, so clogging up the complaints process. \"The best prisons are not the ones with the fewest complaints,\" he says. \"What I have to do is make my office as relevant to the man serving a week, or to the 16-year-old boy, as it is to the man serving life.\" Come October, Shaw will have to deal with the \"uncharted territory\" of the Human Rights Act, Article 3, for example, outlaws cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. \"Is holding two people in a cell with a single toilet not screened off sufficiently degrading to breach Article 3?\" he wonders. \"If a complaint like that came to me, I would have to go on my own judgment as there is no domestic law to help me. It's a bit frightening, but human rights don't stop at the prison gates. If anything, they are more important inside because of inmates' utter dependence on the state.\" For Shaw, his visits to prisons as ombudsman have provoked a puzzling depth of feeling about the impoverishment of inmates' lives. \"I don't know if it is because, after being so long in the last job, I became deadened to the reality of it all,\" he says. \"I am not an abolitionist - I think prisons are an unfortunate social necessity. But I am surprised at how forcibly the pain of imprisonment has struck me.\"",

      "bodyText": "Why is there so much concern about the mortgage industry? A mortgage is the largest single purchase most of us ever make, yet the mortgage industry has had no single regulator and the complex range of packages on offer - from variable to fixed-rate, via endowment and repayment mortgages - means that many homeowners have bought home loans that are entirely unsuitable for their financial needs. Complaints to the banking ombudsman about mortgages leapt by 46% last year, with disputes including grievances about early redemption penalties, allegedly poor advice, unacceptable tie-ins of insurance products and customers being penalised with unfair terms and hidden charges. What have the main problems been? The alleged large-scale mis-selling of endowment mortgages has been a major cause for concern in an industry which made \u00a311bn profit last year. These are investment funds which are intended to mature at the end of the mortgage period, providing sufficient funds to cover the cost of the mortgage. Many homeowners have found that their endowment will not be enough to cover the mortgage and up to half a million homeowners will have to pay thousands of pounds extra to make up the difference. What else? Lenders have been tackled over punitive arrears charges, giving unclear product information and selling the unpopular mortgage indemnity guarantee insurance, which reimburses the lender if the borrower fails to meet repayments and it makes a loss, but does not benefit the homeowner. Mortgage advisers have also been accused of giving biased and inaccurate advice to home loan customers. The treasury's website lists the \"top 10 scams\" by unscrupulous mortgage lenders, including hidden charges and small print that catches the homeowner out. So what happens now? Melanie Johnson, economic secretary to the treasury, has announced a new package of measures to protect borrowers from unfair or restrictive lending practices. Listen to her interview on the Today programme. The plans for a shake-up in the regulatory system include tightening the rules governing the mortgage market and bringing the industry under the regulation of the UK's main financial watchdog, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), headed by chairman Howard Davies. What will this mean for the mortgage industry? The FSA will authorise all mortgage lenders, regulate mortgage advertising and require lenders to disclose all the main features of loans clearly and openly. Until now, complaints about mortgages were dealt with by the banking and building society ombudsmen. The authority will have powers to fine lenders who mis-sell mortgages, force them to pay compensation to homeowners and even to ban them from selling mortgages. It will be illegal to sell mortgages without the approval of the FSA. The watchdog will have a statutory duty to improve public understanding of all financial products, by for instance providing information tables to help consumers to compare products. What about direct help for consumers looking to buy a mortgage? There will also be new voluntary CAT - or charges, access and terms - standards for the mortgage industry: a benchmark for basic standards of simple home loans, showing which products meet the minimum standards, including clear terms and conditions. Among the other chief requirements are that variable rate mortgages must track the bank base rate and have no penalties for paying off the loan early; for fixed and capped-rate mortgages, early redemption penalties must not extend beyond the end of the offer period; interest must be calculated daily rather than annually; and there must be no obligation on the borrower to buy any other \"tied-in\" product. Do the new regulations cover the entire home loan industry? No they don't, and consumer groups, such as Which?, fear the regulations will not go far enough. They are unhappy that Britain's 43,000 mortgage advisers will not be regulated. Many consumers are unaware that while some mortgage advisers offer independent advice, others are employed to sell the investment products of only one company. Also excluded are home loans below \u00a325,000, which will remain covered by the existing consumer credit act, whether they are for a second mortgage or a personal loan secured on a property. When will the new regulations come into force? Not until the summer of 2001, to allow time for lenders to put their house in order as it were - although the voluntary CAT standards will come into force with almost immediate effect. How has the mortgage industry reacted? After a lengthy consultation process, major lenders are expected to welcome most of the changes, but the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the industry's trade association, has called for all mortgages to be regulated, arguing that the exclusion of loans below \u00a325,000 is an \"expensive anomaly\". The FSA's own consumer panel fears the regulations will not go far enough to protect consumers. There is also a danger that the proposed minimum standards could be misinterpreted by the public as amounting to a \"government guarantee\" of good value or suitability. Mortgage buyers are still advised to shop around, take professional advice and find a mortgage suitable to their financial needs.

      "bodyText": "Home secretary Jack Straw would be acting \"unlawfully and irrationally\" if he allowed former dictator Augusto Pinochet to return to Chile on health grounds without allowing opponents to know the medical reasons and have a proper opportunity to mount legal challenges, a High Court judge was told today. The accusation was made by Presiley Baxendale QC, who was applying on behalf of Belgium for permission to seek judicial review of the government's \"failure\" to assure the Belgian authorities that the 84-year-old would not be sent home before Britain had complied with its international legal obligations to co-operate with other countries wanting to extradite Pinochet. Both Belgium and six human-rights groups are arguing that Mr Straw should have given them access to the findings of a team of medical experts who examined the Gen Pinochet earlier this month. Belgium is claiming that as one of the states seeking Gen Pinochet's extradition, it should have been allowed to see the medical evidence behind Mr Straw's decision that he was \"minded\" to allow the former dictator to go home. It also contends that it should also be given the chance to have a Belgian doctor present at a further examination of Gen Pinochet. Ms Baxendale said: \"It's a breach of natural justice if Belgium could not make meaningful representations because they couldn't see the medical records. \"It was irrational because at one and the same time the secretary of state was asking Belgium to make representations and refusing to disclose the details of the report. \"There was no overriding principle of medical confidentiality. That was only one factor to be taken into the balance and could be overridden by the interests of justice.\" The human-rights groups, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture, the Redress Trust, the Association of Relatives of the Disappeared and Justicia also believe the panel of experts should have included an old-age psychiatrist and should have taken longer than seven hours to reach its diagnosis. Belgium is trying to extradite Gen Pinochet on the basis of claims from Chileans living in Belgium that he was behind the jailing and killing of their relatives. In a court packed with the world's press, Ms Baxendale told Mr Justice Maurice Kay that the home secretary, by halting extradition proceedings, was in danger of breaching international law and conventions. The QC said mutual assistance was provided-for under the 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, under which signatories undertook to provide each other with \"the widest measure of mutual assurance in proceedings in respect of offences, the punishment of which falls within the jurisdiction [of the requesting country].\" Mr Straw has undertaken not make a final decision on whether to allow Gen Pinochet to return to Chile while the current challenge is heard by the courts. A plane sent from Chile to bring him home is still in Bermuda awaiting a decision by the home secretary. Before the hearing proper began today, Mr Justice Kay disclosed to the court a potential link between himself and one of the parties, Amnesty International. He said 10 or more years ago, it had been suggested to him that he was on a list of counsel \"approved\" by the human rights organisation and there had once been a suggestion of him working on a case for it. He said that was the \"sum detail\" of the connection, but added: \"In case someone finds my name in a file I thought I ought to raise it now.\" No objections were raised to the judge continuing to hear today's application. Mr Justice Kay's openness follows the unprecedented challenge to the House of Lords' first ruling in the Pinochet case when a judgment had to be set aside after it was disclosed one of the panel of law lords, Lord Hoffmann, had long standing links with Amnesty.",

Cremaster 2, by American artist Matthew Barney, is very much an object - an elaborately crafted, infinitely strange thing that you watch much as you might walk around a complex sculpture, puzzling out how the parts fit together. But it's also a movie - not a scrappy artist's video but a 79-minute film with special effects, stars and a story, or fragments of one. </p> <p>Cremaster 2 - actually the fourth in the series - even has a pitch, of sorts. It's about the master escapologist Harry Houdini and Gary Gilmore, who committed two murders in Utah in 1976 and was subsequently executed at his own insistence. One connection is that Gilmore's grandmother, Baby Fay La Foe, claimed to have had a liaison with Houdini. Another is that Houdini is played by Gilmore's biog- rapher Norman Mailer, whose book The Executioner's Song appears to be one of Barney's sources. </p> <p>The film begins with an ominously swelling organ chord, as the camera pulls out on what first appears to be a landscape, then proves to be a strange horned sculpture made out of small plates of glass or plastic. We cut to an ice floe, then to a meeting between Baby Fay and a couple who plunge their hands into a curious table, one of Barney's idiosyncratically sculpted objects, half art deco, half surgical. Then comes the strangest penetration shot ever - a close-up with shaven pudenda, transparent bondage girdle and a pair of bee wings. </p> <p>In a recording studio, a drummer thrashes out a beat to the sound of 200,000 honey bees buzzing. The images unfold, getting progressively stranger and more lavish. Gilmore takes part in a rodeo on the Utah salt flats; Houdini does his act in a giant beehive; even the Mormon Tabernacle Choir make an appearance. So what does it all mean? </p> <p>That's not really the question. The question is: how does Barney persuade us into fascinated speculation about what it might mean? This is the dazzling illusionist's trick of his intensely hermetic Cremaster films. They all partake of arcane ritual performance and are all based on a nexus of local culture or myth (here of Utah, elsewhere of Hungary or the Isle of Man), which is turned inside out, bent into an anagram of itself. So, apart from the tenuous Gilmore-Houdini connection, the film plays on Utah as a Mormon state that has a beehive as its emblem. The bees, if you like, cross-pollinate the imagery: hive structures, drone sounds, wax and pollen. But there are also references to other Barney motifs: notably the infinitely adaptable Cremaster logo, which forms the basis for 12 \"Tribes of Israel\" flags and the shape of the rodeo arena. The logo is everywhere - we're looking at a self-enclosed mythical world in which the existence of everything is determined by its part in the Cremaster project. </p> <p>Barney boldly risks alienating his audience, yet the result proves irresistibly involving: you want to get to the bottom of the riddle, even while accepting that you never might, and that the riddle may have no bottom anyway. The films are so riveting because Barney uses cinematic resources as imaginatively as anyone currently working, from Peter Strietmann's lushly precise digital photography onwards. </p> <p> Then there are all the questions Barney poses about the way a film fits together: are we getting fragments of an overall coherent story, or just a succession of bizarre images whose connections we have to take on trust? Is this a story with real relations of time and space, or are these ineffably weird tableaux linked like the cells of a beehive, parts of a bigger network? </p> <p>The trade journal Variety, stumped for a category, classified Cremaster 2 as \"experimental drama\" - what else could you call a genre-crossing mixture that partakes of sci-fi, costume drama, real-crime TV movie, hard porn and tourist documentary? Cremaster 2 should finally establish Barney as not just an artist playing at film, but one of the most important new film-makers. But that's what infuriates me about Cremaster. Make films, as Barney does, with money from the art market, and categorise it as art, and there's no limit to where you can let your imagination go. But make them within the film industry, and call them movies, and you're obliged to saddle yourself with coherent narrative, proper characters and upbeat endings. If only the Cremaster series, and works like it, could have a knock- on effect in the film industry, the mainstream could profitably get a little stranger, and a lot freer. </p> <p>\u0095 Cremaster 2 is at the Metro Cinema, London W1 (0171-734 1506), from Friday.</p>",

But there are also references to other Barney motifs: notably the infinitely adaptable Cremaster logo, which forms the basis for 12 \"Tribes of Israel\" flags and the shape of the rodeo arena. The logo is everywhere - we're looking at a self-enclosed mythical world in which the existence of everything is determined by its part in the Cremaster project. Barney boldly risks alienating his audience, yet the result proves irresistibly involving: you want to get to the bottom of the riddle, even while accepting that you never might, and that the riddle may have no bottom anyway. The films are so riveting because Barney uses cinematic resources as imaginatively as anyone currently working, from Peter Strietmann's lushly precise digital photography onwards. Then there are all the questions Barney poses about the way a film fits together: are we getting fragments of an overall coherent story, or just a succession of bizarre images whose connections we have to take on trust? Is this a story with real relations of time and space, or are these ineffably weird tableaux linked like the cells of a beehive, parts of a bigger network? The trade journal Variety, stumped for a category, classified Cremaster 2 as \"experimental drama\" - what else could you call a genre-crossing mixture that partakes of sci-fi, costume drama, real-crime TV movie, hard porn and tourist documentary? Cremaster 2 should finally establish Barney as not just an artist playing at film, but one of the most important new film-makers. But that's what infuriates me about Cremaster. Make films, as Barney does, with money from the art market, and categorise it as art, and there's no limit to where you can let your imagination go. But make them within the film industry, and call them movies, and you're obliged to saddle yourself with coherent narrative, proper characters and upbeat endings. If only the Cremaster series, and works like it, could have a knock- on effect in the film industry, the mainstream could profitably get a little stranger, and a lot freer. \u0095 Cremaster 2 is at the Metro Cinema, London W1 (0171-734 1506), from Friday.",

      "bodyText": "The author of a book on Auschwitz told the high court yesterday that there was a \"massive amount of evidence\" of the use of the camp as a site for mass extermination. Robert van Pelt, professor of architecture at the university of Waterloo in Canada and author of Auschwitz, 1270 To The Present, said evidence had become slowly available during the second world war through reports from escaped inmates. It had become more substantial through witness accounts immediately after the camp's liberation and was confirmed by Polish forensic investigations in 1945-46 and the confessions of German camp personnel. He said it was \"highly implausible\" that the existence of the gas chambers was a piece of \"atrocity propaganda\" fabricated by the British. The evidence that Auschwitz was equipped with gas chambers which were systematically used between 1942 and 1944 had \"emerged cumulatively from a convergence of independent accounts\". It had become possible to assert as \"moral certainty\" the statement that Auschwitz was an extermination camp where the Germans killed around 1m people with the help of gas chambers. Prof van Pelt was giving evidence for Deborah Lipstadt, an American academic, and Penguin Books in their defence of a libel action brought by the historian David Irving. The 62-year-old author of Hitler's War is seeking damages over a claim that he is a \"Holocaust denier\" in Professor Lipstadt's 1994 book, Denying The Holocaust: The Growing Assault On Truth And Memory. Mr Irving, who is representing himself before Mr Justice Gray, denies the systematic extermination of Jews in gas chambers. Accused by the defendants of being \"a liar and a falsifier of history\", he depends on a 1988 report by a man called Fred Leuchter, who had taken samples from ruins at Auschwitz and concluded that there were never homicidal gas chambers there. Prof van Pelt described crematorium two at Auschwitz - where he said 500,000 people had died - as the \"absolute centre of the atrocity\". Evidence for the killings included blueprints for building works, the buildings themselves, and accounts of camp officials and sonderkommandos - Jewish prisoners who worked in the crematoria. He said that when he first saw the surviving original blueprints, he saw not just documents but part of \"a state sponsored project to kill Jews\". He agreed with Mr Irving that a historian had a duty to remain unemotional when looking at a document. \"One's duty is to be unemotional and objective but also remain human in the exercise.\" The hearing was adjourned until today.",

Among the speakers lined up for this term are the Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles, the designer Stella McCartney, the editor of Loaded magazine, Tim Southwell, the musician Brian May, and the international drug dealer Howard Marks. The union's president, Lucy Aitkens, said her approach was intended to make the discussions more accessible for students and she denied the range of topics would lead to a drop in debating standards. Motions up for discussion include \"this house would rather play Wembley than Westminster\" and \"this house believes that British comedy is superior to American comedy\". Miss Aitkens, 20, of St Hilda's college, said: \"We have got such a high workload in Oxford and while everybody likes intellectual debates on international finance every now and then, there should be debates about enjoyment and having fun. \"Sometimes we have put on really prestigious speakers but they don't attract the same number of students. \"We are keeping the same standard of intellectual speakers but there are other people who have all succeeded in their fields. \"My primary aim is to keep the place as popular and as central to student life as it always has been and I listened to my friends and asked them who they wanted to see.\" She was particularly looking forward to hearing a discussion about Islam and the west which Benazir Bhutto will be taking part in. The union was founded in 1823 as a forum for discussion and debate and former officers include William Gladstone, Harold Macmillan, Edward Heath, Tony Benn, Michael Heseltine and William Hague. World figures including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Mother Teresa, Malcolm X and the Dalai Lama have spoken at the union as have the US presidents Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Last year Yasser Arafat made his first international speech after the Israeli elections and in February Ian Paisley, David Trimble and John Hume answered questions on Northern Ireland. The novelist Tariq Ali, who was president of the union in 1965, said: \"One cannot blame them for doing what everyone else is doing but I think it's appalling.\"",

The table reveals for the first time the scale of British exports involved. It shows that in the past 4 years some 6,659 firms asked for aid to back \u00a3298bn worth of business. The ECGD issued 821 export guarantees covering \u00a314.6bn worth of business. The country-by-country breakdown reveals that some of the biggest number of applications were for Turkey, the Russian Federation, China, Saudi Arabia and Oman - all likely to be deals involving arms sales or dealing with regimes where human rights are a significant issue. Other tables show that demand for export credits to Arab states are so high that the department has run out of money to service them. It is estimated that a third of the export guarantees issued by ECGD are for arms sales. The row in Whitehall has been intensified because of pressures by environmental campaigners and third world debt groups demanding that Britain moves towards support for sustainable development to help the poorest nations. This was a key part of the review ordered by Stephen Byers, the trade secretary, into the future role of ECGD. The aim was to bring Britain's policy in line with the World Bank, which takes a strong line on the environment, and other countries, like Sweden, which apply tough criteria to export aid. The new policy will be announced in March.",

      "body": "<p>You don't have to speak German to get the message. \"Dieses System ist korrupt,\" says the slogan splashed across a thousand banners in Berlin. The protesters are shaking their fists at Helmut Kohl, the man who ruled them for 16 years and who now stands accused of taking sackloads of illegal cash - and plotting with a foreign government to distort the course of German history. The result is a scandal which goes beyond old King Kohl. The reputation of politics itself is on the line - and not just in Germany. For Kohl-gate has come just as voters all over the world are bombarded with evidence that their leaders are for sale. Those placards in Berlin could soon be brandished in Birmingham or Boston: \"This system is corrupt.\"</p> <p>The German scandal is getting bigger and bleaker every day, with all the elements of a classic political thriller: secret slush funds, missing files, global ramifications and now - a body. (Last week Christian Democrat financial officer Wolfgang Huellen was found hanged in his Berlin flat.) The nub of it is Mr Kohl's admission that he used to run a network of secret accounts - not for his own private gain, but to hide anonymous donations to the CDU. The cash was salted away by an official known only as \"the Postman\". The former chancellor has confessed to about a million dollars' worth of these illegal, undeclared gifts, but his accusers say the real figure is much, much larger.</p> <p>Now a new, even more lethal bombshell has landed: on Monday news organisations in Paris and Berlin reported that former French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had arranged roughly \u00a310m in payments to the CDU via the French petrol company, Elf Aquitaine, to help Kohl get through a sticky 1994 election campaign. It is a staggering charge: a French socialist bankrolling a German conservative, one head of state using taxpayers' money (Elf was state-owned at the time) to help another. It is hard to think of a political scandal, anywhere, that is more serious. Even Watergate did not accuse Richard Nixon of fighting an election with cash provided by Harold Wilson.</p> <p>If these charges stand up, the debris will scatter all across Europe. It will taint forever the architects of economic and monetary union, Kohl and Mitterrand - condemning them as a couple of corrupt old fixers, happy to resort to bribery to get their way. And if their personal standing is bruised, then so surely is their shared brainchild, the single currency. Norman Lamont was on the radio yesterday, spouting a lot of hysterical, xenophobic nonsense about the \"contagion\" of Teutonic-Gallic corruption spreading to our shores. \"We are a clean country!\" he insisted, in an exquisite, Captain Mainwaring moment. But on one claim, he had a point. He recalled that the French had approved of the Maastricht treaty in a knife-edge referendum in 1992: if Mitterrand was happy to bend German ballots with cash, might he have likewise twisted the process in his own country? The moral authority of the European project, already so badly shaken by last year's non-resignation resignations at the European Commission, could be about to vanish in a cloud of rancid smoke.</p> <p>Even if the EU manages to escape unscathed from this increasingly pan-European scandal, German politics will not. Kohl has already admitted taking those 2m marks - but the CDU cannot pretend the problem began and ended with him. Corruption is part of the Christian Democrat present as well as its past. The current party leader, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has had to confess to accepting $50,000 from a fugitive arms dealer, and the courts now say they want to look at last year's CDU victory in state elections in Hesse after the party boss there admitted he had funnelled money through Swiss bank accounts.</p> <p>Alongside all this, our own outbreaks of sleaze seem almost quaint. Next to the Christian Democrats, Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken look like amateurs. But we are not without the contagion, despite what Norman Lamont might say. His own party also used cash and back channels and foreign donations to influence our elections and change our laws. But, like the Germans, we too cannot pretend this is all in our past. The department of trade and industry has now expanded its investigation into the tangled business affairs of the former treasury minister Geoffrey Robinson, and his equally convoluted engineering firm TransTec. Over the weekend, two of TransTec's top former officials broke cover to declare they had filed false and misleading grant applications to the DTI in the 80s - fiddling the figures to get their hands on more public money.</p> <p>In the United States, meanwhile, the hot breath of corruption is constantly there, misting up the mirror of democratic politics. Yesterday Americans heard the first results of the presidential contest of 2000. They learned that both Republican and Democratic front-runners, George W Bush and Al Gore, had won their respective battles in the farmland state of Iowa. But most Americans will also have known that both Bush and Gore were helped by colossal, multimillion dollar warchests, which enabled them to carpetbomb their rivals in the \"air war\" of television advertising. The voters will also be aware that most of those millions will have come from special interests and lobby groups who, when the time comes, will want a return on their investment. As the poster says: \"Dieses System ist korrupt.\"</p> <p>We cannot comfort ourselves that this is a German contagion or an American disease. It seems money washes around every democracy where money makes a difference, and that's most of them. But there is a price to pay. These constant revelations of corruption, even in such previously trusted figures as Helmut Kohl, corrodes public faith in the very business of democratic governance. That is clearly a problem in itself: the degradation of public discourse, the spread of cynicism, makes our collective life less civilised. But there is a more tangible, more bread-and-butter impact. For if we stop trusting politicians, then we will stop trusting them with our money. And that changes not just politics, but society.</p> <p>It has become a truism of modern, post-Reagan, post-Thatcher politics that people will never vote to raise their taxes. The new year has seen the first signs of a thaw in that deep freeze. The NHS crisis seems to have set people wondering: is it time, in an age of cash-starved schools and hospitals, that we started paying more for the services we all share? That will be quite a taboo to break. It means asking people to hand over even more of their income to strangers, so that they can spend it on their behalf. For that, lest we forget, is what taxpaying is about: a relationship of trust. It breaks down if I, the voter, stop trusting you, the politician: I won't want to give you more of my money to spend. That's why these corruption scandals deserve our attention. They are not the small change of politics: they threaten the very purpose of it.</p>",

The protesters are shaking their fists at Helmut Kohl, the man who ruled them for 16 years and who now stands accused of taking sackloads of illegal cash - and plotting with a foreign government to distort the course of German history. The result is a scandal which goes beyond old King Kohl. The reputation of politics itself is on the line - and not just in Germany. For Kohl-gate has come just as voters all over the world are bombarded with evidence that their leaders are for sale. Those placards in Berlin could soon be brandished in Birmingham or Boston: \"This system is corrupt.\" The German scandal is getting bigger and bleaker every day, with all the elements of a classic political thriller: secret slush funds, missing files, global ramifications and now - a body. (Last week Christian Democrat financial officer Wolfgang Huellen was found hanged in his Berlin flat.) The nub of it is Mr Kohl's admission that he used to run a network of secret accounts - not for his own private gain, but to hide anonymous donations to the CDU. The cash was salted away by an official known only as \"the Postman\". The former chancellor has confessed to about a million dollars' worth of these illegal, undeclared gifts, but his accusers say the real figure is much, much larger. Now a new, even more lethal bombshell has landed: on Monday news organisations in Paris and Berlin reported that former French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had arranged roughly \u00a310m in payments to the CDU via the French petrol company, Elf Aquitaine, to help Kohl get through a sticky 1994 election campaign. It is a staggering charge: a French socialist bankrolling a German conservative, one head of state using taxpayers' money (Elf was state-owned at the time) to help another. It is hard to think of a political scandal, anywhere, that is more serious. Even Watergate did not accuse Richard Nixon of fighting an election with cash provided by Harold Wilson. If these charges stand up, the debris will scatter all across Europe. It will taint forever the architects of economic and monetary union, Kohl and Mitterrand - condemning them as a couple of corrupt old fixers, happy to resort to bribery to get their way. And if their personal standing is bruised, then so surely is their shared brainchild, the single currency. Norman Lamont was on the radio yesterday, spouting a lot of hysterical, xenophobic nonsense about the \"contagion\" of Teutonic-Gallic corruption spreading to our shores. \"We are a clean country!\" he insisted, in an exquisite, Captain Mainwaring moment. But on one claim, he had a point. He recalled that the French had approved of the Maastricht treaty in a knife-edge referendum in 1992: if Mitterrand was happy to bend German ballots with cash, might he have likewise twisted the process in his own country? The moral authority of the European project, already so badly shaken by last year's non-resignation resignations at the European Commission, could be about to vanish in a cloud of rancid smoke. Even if the EU manages to escape unscathed from this increasingly pan-European scandal, German politics will not. Kohl has already admitted taking those 2m marks - but the CDU cannot pretend the problem began and ended with him. Corruption is part of the Christian Democrat present as well as its past. The current party leader, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has had to confess to accepting $50,000 from a fugitive arms dealer, and the courts now say they want to look at last year's CDU victory in state elections in Hesse after the party boss there admitted he had funnelled money through Swiss bank accounts. Alongside all this, our own outbreaks of sleaze seem almost quaint. Next to the Christian Democrats, Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken look like amateurs. But we are not without the contagion, despite what Norman Lamont might say. His own party also used cash and back channels and foreign donations to influence our elections and change our laws. But, like the Germans, we too cannot pretend this is all in our past. The department of trade and industry has now expanded its investigation into the tangled business affairs of the former treasury minister Geoffrey Robinson, and his equally convoluted engineering firm TransTec. Over the weekend, two of TransTec's top former officials broke cover to declare they had filed false and misleading grant applications to the DTI in the 80s - fiddling the figures to get their hands on more public money. In the United States, meanwhile, the hot breath of corruption is constantly there, misting up the mirror of democratic politics. Yesterday Americans heard the first results of the presidential contest of 2000. They learned that both Republican and Democratic front-runners, George W Bush and Al Gore, had won their respective battles in the farmland state of Iowa. But most Americans will also have known that both Bush and Gore were helped by colossal, multimillion dollar warchests, which enabled them to carpetbomb their rivals in the \"air war\" of television advertising. The voters will also be aware that most of those millions will have come from special interests and lobby groups who, when the time comes, will want a return on their investment. As the poster says: \"Dieses System ist korrupt.\" We cannot comfort ourselves that this is a German contagion or an American disease. It seems money washes around every democracy where money makes a difference, and that's most of them. But there is a price to pay. These constant revelations of corruption, even in such previously trusted figures as Helmut Kohl, corrodes public faith in the very business of democratic governance. That is clearly a problem in itself: the degradation of public discourse, the spread of cynicism, makes our collective life less civilised. But there is a more tangible, more bread-and-butter impact. For if we stop trusting politicians, then we will stop trusting them with our money. And that changes not just politics, but society. It has become a truism of modern, post-Reagan, post-Thatcher politics that people will never vote to raise their taxes. The new year has seen the first signs of a thaw in that deep freeze. The NHS crisis seems to have set people wondering: is it time, in an age of cash-starved schools and hospitals, that we started paying more for the services we all share? That will be quite a taboo to break. It means asking people to hand over even more of their income to strangers, so that they can spend it on their behalf. For that, lest we forget, is what taxpaying is about: a relationship of trust. It breaks down if I, the voter, stop trusting you, the politician: I won't want to give you more of my money to spend. That's why these corruption scandals deserve our attention. They are not the small change of politics: they threaten the very purpose of it.",

      "bodyText": "Bill Gates, the world's richest man, yesterday emerged as the most philanthropic person on the planet after donating another $5bn to his charitable foundation. The latest gift by the founder of Microsoft, the software giant, brings the total managed by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to $21.8bn (\u00a313.2bn) - edging it past the UK's Wellcome Trust, which has assets of \u00a313.0bn. Yesterday's announcement coincides with the latest development in the long-running legal battle between Microsoft and the US justice department, which has accused the company of abusing its monopoly position in the world's software market. Mr Gates and his wife have appeared to become far more generous since the US government's anti-monopolies case started in 1998. Last year Mr Gates said he was committed to giving away the majority of his wealth, estimated at about $100bn and based on his 15% stake in Microsoft. The foundation has focused on health and education issues around the world including work to limit the spread of Aids in Africa. Three months ago the foundation announced that it would donate $750m over five years to help vaccinate children in developing countries. To keep its tax-exempt status the fund must give away at least 5% of its endowment each year. Government officials were yesterday preparing to present their rebuttal of Microsoft's defence in Washington. The response is expected to argue that the company has ignored the indictment of its behaviour already made by the trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson. Bad weather on the east coast of the US was yesterday threatening to prevent the government from physically filing its 30-page rebuttal to a snowbound courthouse.",

Civilians, afraid to venture out, bury their dead in the courtyards of their apartment buildings.</p> <p>The daily bombardment by Russian aircraft and artillery has so devastated the capital of Chechnya that when the war ultimately ends, there will be few homes left standing for those who wish to return.</p> <p>For the rebels, life is guerrilla warfare. For civilians, it is a test of survival.</p> <p>Despite heavy losses, morale appears high among the 2,500 to 3,000 rebel fighters encamped in Grozny. They swear they will not give in to the \"Russian aggressors\", and predict the war will continue for many months.</p> <p>\"The Russians can destroy our city, they can reduce it to rubble, but they will never be able to seize it and control it,\" said Vakha Israilov, commander of a Chechen battalion. \"We will never lay down our arms.\"</p> <p>The battle for Grozny began with a Russian assault on Christmas Day, but the troops have made little progress in driving out the rebels. As Moscow attempts to retake the separatist republic it lost in a bloody 1994-96 war, it risks repeating costly mistakes.</p> <p>The Russians regularly claim they have captured various city districts, but it is unclear how much they actually hold.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin, the acting president who rose in popularity while he was prime minister last autumn by leading Russia into the second Chechen war, is banking on a successful military campaign to help him become president this spring. This fact is not lost on the Muslim rebels, who are doing their best to wreck his plans.</p> <p>\"It is clear that the Russians are bogged down up to their ears in the war in Chechnya,\" said Ruslan Makhmayev, 35, a unit commander. \"And there is no chance the war will be over before March 26, the day of the presidential elections in Russia. What Putin expected would bring him to power will in fact become his undoing.\"</p> <p>Mr Putin portrays the Chechen rebels as \"terrorists and bandits\" who engage in kidnapping for profit and behead their victims when ransoms are not paid. The rebels cast themselves as freedom fighters struggling to liberate their republic from 150 years of repressive rule from Moscow.</p> <p>In Grozny, the fighters appear upbeat, well-fed and well-groomed, given their circumstances. In one basement, they have built a sauna. They obtain water from natural springs nearby and heat their subterranean dwellings with wood-burning stoves.</p> <p>Many of the rebels fought in the first Chechen war, unlike most of their young Russian opponents. They say they are prepared for a long siege and have enough food and ammunition to last indefinitely, adding to their stores with munitions taken from Russians.</p> <p>The biggest shortage is of anaesthetics and medicine in the three hospitals where doctors operate on the wounded. \"Over the past few days, our doctors have had to perform surgery without any anaesthetics,\" Mr Makhmayev said.</p> <p>In the city's Oktyabrsky district, which is under the control of Chechen forces, no building has escaped damage from Russian bombs. Many have been reduced to shells. Smoke rises from fires, and a haze hangs over the city. Falling snow mingles with ash and turns grey before it hits the ground.

      "bodyText": "Rebel fighters in Grozny live in the basements of bombed-out buildings and travel underground through a network of tunnels. Doctors operate without anaesthetics. Civilians, afraid to venture out, bury their dead in the courtyards of their apartment buildings. The daily bombardment by Russian aircraft and artillery has so devastated the capital of Chechnya that when the war ultimately ends, there will be few homes left standing for those who wish to return. For the rebels, life is guerrilla warfare. For civilians, it is a test of survival. Despite heavy losses, morale appears high among the 2,500 to 3,000 rebel fighters encamped in Grozny. They swear they will not give in to the \"Russian aggressors\", and predict the war will continue for many months. \"The Russians can destroy our city, they can reduce it to rubble, but they will never be able to seize it and control it,\" said Vakha Israilov, commander of a Chechen battalion. \"We will never lay down our arms.\" The battle for Grozny began with a Russian assault on Christmas Day, but the troops have made little progress in driving out the rebels. As Moscow attempts to retake the separatist republic it lost in a bloody 1994-96 war, it risks repeating costly mistakes. The Russians regularly claim they have captured various city districts, but it is unclear how much they actually hold. Vladimir Putin, the acting president who rose in popularity while he was prime minister last autumn by leading Russia into the second Chechen war, is banking on a successful military campaign to help him become president this spring. This fact is not lost on the Muslim rebels, who are doing their best to wreck his plans. \"It is clear that the Russians are bogged down up to their ears in the war in Chechnya,\" said Ruslan Makhmayev, 35, a unit commander. \"And there is no chance the war will be over before March 26, the day of the presidential elections in Russia. What Putin expected would bring him to power will in fact become his undoing.\" Mr Putin portrays the Chechen rebels as \"terrorists and bandits\" who engage in kidnapping for profit and behead their victims when ransoms are not paid. The rebels cast themselves as freedom fighters struggling to liberate their republic from 150 years of repressive rule from Moscow. In Grozny, the fighters appear upbeat, well-fed and well-groomed, given their circumstances. In one basement, they have built a sauna. They obtain water from natural springs nearby and heat their subterranean dwellings with wood-burning stoves. Many of the rebels fought in the first Chechen war, unlike most of their young Russian opponents. They say they are prepared for a long siege and have enough food and ammunition to last indefinitely, adding to their stores with munitions taken from Russians. The biggest shortage is of anaesthetics and medicine in the three hospitals where doctors operate on the wounded. \"Over the past few days, our doctors have had to perform surgery without any anaesthetics,\" Mr Makhmayev said. In the city's Oktyabrsky district, which is under the control of Chechen forces, no building has escaped damage from Russian bombs. Many have been reduced to shells. Smoke rises from fires, and a haze hangs over the city. Falling snow mingles with ash and turns grey before it hits the ground. Stray dogs and cats roam in search of food. An estimated 8,000 to 25,000 civilians remain in the city, mostly hiding in basements. There is little food. Those who venture on to the streets do so only because they have to. Most of the civilians are elderly Russians who lack the means or connections that would help them to escape. \"The losses among civilians are tremendous, and most of them are ethnic Russians,\" said Avalu Saydayev, 30, commander of a rebel reconnaissance platoon. \"The federals are killing their own people.\" The rebels have turned blocks of flats and government buildings into fortresses, strengthening hide-outs with concrete and logs.

The story was invented by Parson Weems, an early biographer of Washington, who strongly believed it was always wrong to hit children. The point of his fiction was not that children ought to be honest, but that if parents didn't hit them, they would wish to tell the truth. Parson Weems would have adorned yesterday's brief Commons debate on the parental authority bill, introduced by Andrew Robathan, the Tory MP for Blaby, and fiercely opposed by Hilton Dawson, who sits for Labour in Lancaster.

Grants, such as are available to students in other professions with recruitment problems, will help. However, the training crisis is not just about attracting students, but about the declining ability of the current childcare system to provide them with the necessary practical experience.</p> <p>Those who start out wanting to work in childcare are diverted either during the training, or after qualification. Expensively trained practice teachers typically move into management having supervised an average of just three students. Many local authorities indulged in a bout of early retirement schemes a few years ago, stripping out experienced staff who should have provided security for newcomers. Skill comes through the ability to learn through practical experience: this does not happen by accident.

      "bodyText": "Social work has become less attractive to students for a range of reasons (Leader, January 25). Grants, such as are available to students in other professions with recruitment problems, will help. However, the training crisis is not just about attracting students, but about the declining ability of the current childcare system to provide them with the necessary practical experience. Those who start out wanting to work in childcare are diverted either during the training, or after qualification. Expensively trained practice teachers typically move into management having supervised an average of just three students. Many local authorities indulged in a bout of early retirement schemes a few years ago, stripping out experienced staff who should have provided security for newcomers. Skill comes through the ability to learn through practical experience: this does not happen by accident. The best child protection workers will be those whose natural intelligence and sensitivity is honed through good academic and practical education.

Anxious to combat the commission's reputation for secrecy, Mr Prodi announced yesterday that he would shortly be making a register of his correspondence available on his personal website. \"Transparency is vital for the democratic health and accountability of the EU,' the former Italian prime minister said - apparently trying to set an example to colleagues. Aides said this did not mean Mr Prodi's personal correspondence would be available, or that all official letters would be either - though it would be known whom he had written to on such and such a date. \"Outgoing correspondence will carry a warning to the recipient that all future correspondence will be publicly registered and may be made available to third parties,\" a statement said. Mr Prodi's initiative was criticised as an attempt to divert attention from broader freedom of information proposals due to be published today, which have been criticised as a step back for open government. Under an existing code of conduct, anyone may apply for any documents from the commission, the European Council of Ministers and European parliament and then the institution can apply exceptions. But the new proposals, widely leaked in Brussels, create whole categories of papers that cannot be applied for - on the grounds that officials need protection for their \"space to think to formulate policy\". Exceptions include \"discussion documents, opinions of departments and informal messages\". Other areas that are declared off-limits are \"relations between or with member states or non-community institutions\" and matters touching on the \"stability of the community legal order.\" \"Prodi's announcement about his correspondence is clearly a diversion, as the latest proposals are taking us back to before Maastricht days,\" said Tony Bunyan of Statewatch, which monitors the state and civil liberties in the EU. \"They are putting the clock back.\" The council of ministers, where the 15 EU governments cooperate, is now less secretive than the commission. Experts predict that the definition of what constitutes \"space to think\" will provide rich pickings for the European Court of Justice, which rules on the EU's treaties. But today's proposals do not, as anticipated, include an order to member states that they must follow the same practice at their national level - an idea which provoked outrage in Sweden, with the most advanced freedom of information system in the world. The proposals were drawn up after the 1997 Amsterdam Treaty called on the commission to \"enshrine\" the citizens' right of access to documents. They have to be adopted under the co-decision procedure by the council of ministers, the commission and the European parliament by June 2001. \"This is much more liberal than some had anticipated but still not liberal enough,\" said one diplomat.",

Mr Gore's performance was all the stronger for being based on clear wins among almost all categories of voters.</p> <p>The vice-president watched the results come in from his Des Moines hotel headquarters with his wife Tipper. Later, he told cheering supporters that he had won \"the biggest victory in the history of the contested caucuses in Iowa\".</p> <p>Within minutes, he was being driven to Air Force Two to fly to New Hampshire in the early hours to resume his contest with Mr Bradley. A poll yesterday showed Mr Gore and Mr Bradley level pegging there.</p> <p>Mr Bradley's 35% slightly exceeded his camp's last-minute spin, but it was a poor return for a month of campaigning in Iowa in which he spent more than $800,000 (\u00a3500,000).</p> <p>Before leaving Iowa, Mr Bradley made clear that his defeat would not cause him to throw in the towel or, more surprisingly, to change a style which has been criticised for being too aloof.</p> <p>The former New Jersey senator told supporters that he had \"a little more humility but no less confidence that I can win\".</p> <p>Mr Bush, the governor of Texas and the son of the former president, George Bush, claimed a \"record-shattering victory\" in the Iowa Republican race.</p> <p>\"This victory marks the beginning of the end of the Clinton era,\" Mr Bush told his supporters at a Des Moines rally. But although Mr Bush finished well ahead of any of his party rivals, the Republican result left many more unanswered questions than did the Democratic contest.</p> <p>In a six-man Republican race, Mr Bush took 41% of the votes, followed by the millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who finished second with 30%. The black anti-abortion conservative Alan Keyes was third with 14%, followed by family values campaigner Gary Bauer on 9%, Arizona Senator John McCain on 5% and Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in last place with 1%.</p> <p>Mr Bush's clear but inconclusive victory means that the New Hampshire Republican contest is likely to become a crucial test for his reputation as an irresistible winner.</p> <p>To pass that test Mr Bush must reverse the poll lead there of Mr McCain, who did not campaign in Iowa, and must simultaneously fight off the renewed strength of Mr Forbes and Mr Keyes. Mr McCain is ahead of Mr Bush in the nine most recent New Hampshire polls, including one yesterday giving him an 11-point advantage.</p> <p>Mr Forbes's strong showing enabled him to lay immediate claim to the mantle of conser vative frontrunner in the Republican race.</p> <p>\"I am pumped,\" Mr Forbes told supporters. \"This is a victory for ideas. New Hampshire is now a tight three-way contest with me fighting the conservative cause against two moderates.\"</p> <p>The importance of Mr Forbes's second place was somewhat subverted by the strong showing of his fellow conservative Mr Keyes, a staunch Roman Catholic and former Reagan administration ambassador who has climbed from the bottom of the heap to a clear Iowa third place largely on the strength of his trenchant moral values and anti-abortion oratory.</p> <p>As so often in the past, the Iowa caucuses are likely to winnow the field of candidates as well as boosting the winners. Senator Hatch yesterday withdrew from the race along with the social conservative, Mr Bauer.</p>",

The biggest winner in Iowa was the vice-president, Al Gore, who crowned an impressive recent campaign fightback by trouncing his only rival, former senator Bill Bradley, by an unexpectedly large margin of 63% to 35% in the Democratic contest. Mr Gore's performance was all the stronger for being based on clear wins among almost all categories of voters. The vice-president watched the results come in from his Des Moines hotel headquarters with his wife Tipper. Later, he told cheering supporters that he had won \"the biggest victory in the history of the contested caucuses in Iowa\". Within minutes, he was being driven to Air Force Two to fly to New Hampshire in the early hours to resume his contest with Mr Bradley. A poll yesterday showed Mr Gore and Mr Bradley level pegging there. Mr Bradley's 35% slightly exceeded his camp's last-minute spin, but it was a poor return for a month of campaigning in Iowa in which he spent more than $800,000 (\u00a3500,000). Before leaving Iowa, Mr Bradley made clear that his defeat would not cause him to throw in the towel or, more surprisingly, to change a style which has been criticised for being too aloof. The former New Jersey senator told supporters that he had \"a little more humility but no less confidence that I can win\". Mr Bush, the governor of Texas and the son of the former president, George Bush, claimed a \"record-shattering victory\" in the Iowa Republican race. \"This victory marks the beginning of the end of the Clinton era,\" Mr Bush told his supporters at a Des Moines rally. But although Mr Bush finished well ahead of any of his party rivals, the Republican result left many more unanswered questions than did the Democratic contest. In a six-man Republican race, Mr Bush took 41% of the votes, followed by the millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who finished second with 30%. The black anti-abortion conservative Alan Keyes was third with 14%, followed by family values campaigner Gary Bauer on 9%, Arizona Senator John McCain on 5% and Utah Senator Orrin Hatch in last place with 1%. Mr Bush's clear but inconclusive victory means that the New Hampshire Republican contest is likely to become a crucial test for his reputation as an irresistible winner. To pass that test Mr Bush must reverse the poll lead there of Mr McCain, who did not campaign in Iowa, and must simultaneously fight off the renewed strength of Mr Forbes and Mr Keyes. Mr McCain is ahead of Mr Bush in the nine most recent New Hampshire polls, including one yesterday giving him an 11-point advantage. Mr Forbes's strong showing enabled him to lay immediate claim to the mantle of conser vative frontrunner in the Republican race. \"I am pumped,\" Mr Forbes told supporters. \"This is a victory for ideas. New Hampshire is now a tight three-way contest with me fighting the conservative cause against two moderates.\" The importance of Mr Forbes's second place was somewhat subverted by the strong showing of his fellow conservative Mr Keyes, a staunch Roman Catholic and former Reagan administration ambassador who has climbed from the bottom of the heap to a clear Iowa third place largely on the strength of his trenchant moral values and anti-abortion oratory. As so often in the past, the Iowa caucuses are likely to winnow the field of candidates as well as boosting the winners. Senator Hatch yesterday withdrew from the race along with the social conservative, Mr Bauer.",

      "body": "<p>The spirit of Alastair Hetherington - fifth of only seven editors of the Guardian in the 130 years since CP Scott was appointed - was honoured yesterday with Gaelic songs amid a throng of personal and political memories.</p> <p>The Labour politician Tony Benn told a thanksgiving service at the Crown Court Church of Scotland, Covent Garden, London, that he was a truly great editor who had resisted demands by successive prime ministers for \"absolute support and total silence\".</p> <p>Mr Hetherington, editor from 1956-1975, died in October, aged 79. He played a decisive part in saving the paper from collapse or merger with the Times during a mid-1960s financial crisis.</p> <p>Peter Preston, his successor until 1995, said his spirit still inhabited the paper's work and thought. Its core message was that \"there is no such thing as a fate that can't be challenged or a force which has to be accepted; that men and women, by their own efforts, can always make a better world. His voice, three decades on, is as fresh as ever.\"</p> <p>The thanksgiving was a rare event at which a paper normally preoccupied with daily production wore some of its personal bonds and feelings on its sleeve in public.</p> <p>As well as readers, the service drew an unprecedented turn-out of some 120 retired or former members of staff, some with links stretching back more than half a century.</p> <p>Among the old Guards (or \"the old Grauds\", as a younger reporter called them) was a pioneering women's editor accused 40 years ago by management of producing pages obsessed with \"unmarried women graduates\"; and a leader writer who resigned over 1960s Vietnam policies.</p> <p>Public figures included the writer Michael Frayn, an ex-Guardian diarist, the former BBC director general Sir Michael Checkland and Mr Hetherington's contemporary as Times editor, Lord Rees-Mogg.</p> <p>Also there was Richard Scott, the only living person to have known all seven Guardian editors since his grandfather, CP Scott. Mr Scott, former chairman of the Scott Trust, which owns the paper, said: \"Alastair was the first of the modern editors. For him, too, facts were sacred.

      "bodyText": "The spirit of Alastair Hetherington - fifth of only seven editors of the Guardian in the 130 years since CP Scott was appointed - was honoured yesterday with Gaelic songs amid a throng of personal and political memories. The Labour politician Tony Benn told a thanksgiving service at the Crown Court Church of Scotland, Covent Garden, London, that he was a truly great editor who had resisted demands by successive prime ministers for \"absolute support and total silence\". Mr Hetherington, editor from 1956-1975, died in October, aged 79. He played a decisive part in saving the paper from collapse or merger with the Times during a mid-1960s financial crisis. Peter Preston, his successor until 1995, said his spirit still inhabited the paper's work and thought. Its core message was that \"there is no such thing as a fate that can't be challenged or a force which has to be accepted; that men and women, by their own efforts, can always make a better world. His voice, three decades on, is as fresh as ever.\" The thanksgiving was a rare event at which a paper normally preoccupied with daily production wore some of its personal bonds and feelings on its sleeve in public. As well as readers, the service drew an unprecedented turn-out of some 120 retired or former members of staff, some with links stretching back more than half a century. Among the old Guards (or \"the old Grauds\", as a younger reporter called them) was a pioneering women's editor accused 40 years ago by management of producing pages obsessed with \"unmarried women graduates\"; and a leader writer who resigned over 1960s Vietnam policies. Public figures included the writer Michael Frayn, an ex-Guardian diarist, the former BBC director general Sir Michael Checkland and Mr Hetherington's contemporary as Times editor, Lord Rees-Mogg. Also there was Richard Scott, the only living person to have known all seven Guardian editors since his grandfather, CP Scott. Mr Scott, former chairman of the Scott Trust, which owns the paper, said: \"Alastair was the first of the modern editors. For him, too, facts were sacred. He too believed a newspaper had a moral as well as a material existence. But Alastair never had it quite so easy. Power and authority within the paper had moved from the editor's to the manager's chair. Alastair had to fight and did fight. Indeed, had he not done so at one very low point in the paper's financial situation, it is more than likely that the Guardian as we know it would have ceased to exist.\" The BBC's retired political editor, John Cole, who was Mr Hetherington's deputy, recalled his will, courage, \"sheer animal stamina\" and \"sense of radical mischief. He never became an establishment figure and that was his personal choice.\" His widow, Sheila, said: \"Life with Alastair was like being part of a whirlwind, often unexpected but always full of delight.\" She added of his first wife, Miranda, the mother of his children: \"He was rightly proud of them all and was an unfailingly loving father.\" After leaving the Guardian, Mr Hetherington returned to his homeland to become controller of BBC Scotland, where he is cherished for promoting Gaelic culture. In recognition of this and his love of Scots islands - as well as of the sadness of the Alzheimer's disease which clouded his last years - the Gaelic singer Iseabail McTaggart sang the lament An Ataireachd Ard (The High Swelling of the Sea): The roar of the sea is as was heard by me as a child, Without change, without pity, shovelling the sand of the shore. The everlasting swelling, listen to the sound of the swelling. But I'll depart from you, I'll not move any more to meet you, My age and my appearance tell the shortness of my day, I am wrapped in the cold slumber of death. Make up my bed behind the sound of the sea.",

Dr Anderson said they had no qualms about choosing another book of poetry. \"There was some argument over whether a translation was the same as a collection, but that was it.

She can draw some comfort, however, from the fact that her book won the \u00a310,000 children's prize. </p> <p>The snubbing of Harry Potter was not the only bit of controversy around this year's prize. The presence of model Jerry Hall on the judging panel was condemned by rival Booker Prize organiser Martyn Goff as \"blatant dumbing down\". She is known to be an avid Harry Potter fan and is believed to have argued for Rowling. But Dr Anderson said \"all the judges had extremely pertinent things to say and brought freshness to the discussions\". </p> <p>Rowling's trilogy about the boy wizard Harry Potter has already sold more than 27.5m copies worldwide. Her fourth book, not yet finished, has already become an internet bestseller on advance orders alone. </p> <p>The story behind the first book Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone has now passed into publishing legend. Rowling, a penniless single mother, wrote it by longhand in a series of cafes where she went to save money on heating bills. </p> <p>The other books on the shortlist were Rose Tremain's novel Music and Silence, White City Blue by Tim Lott and the second volume of David Cairns's biography of Berlioz, Servitude and Greatness.</p>",

Dr Anderson said they had no qualms about choosing another book of poetry. \"There was some argument over whether a translation was the same as a collection, but that was it. This has been a remarkable period for poetry. Two colossi have bestrode this narrow world in recent years. Hughes and Heaney are the greatest poets of the 20th century after TS Eliot.\" The poet and critic Tom Paulin called Heaney's Be owulf a \"timeless classic... a hymn to the deep North Sea energies and roots of the English language\". Heaney, a scholar of Anglo-Saxon, first began the translation 15 years ago. JK Rowling, the 2/1 joint favourite with Heaney, was struck down by flu and could not leave Edinburgh. She can draw some comfort, however, from the fact that her book won the \u00a310,000 children's prize. The snubbing of Harry Potter was not the only bit of controversy around this year's prize. The presence of model Jerry Hall on the judging panel was condemned by rival Booker Prize organiser Martyn Goff as \"blatant dumbing down\". She is known to be an avid Harry Potter fan and is believed to have argued for Rowling. But Dr Anderson said \"all the judges had extremely pertinent things to say and brought freshness to the discussions\". Rowling's trilogy about the boy wizard Harry Potter has already sold more than 27.5m copies worldwide. Her fourth book, not yet finished, has already become an internet bestseller on advance orders alone. The story behind the first book Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone has now passed into publishing legend. Rowling, a penniless single mother, wrote it by longhand in a series of cafes where she went to save money on heating bills. The other books on the shortlist were Rose Tremain's novel Music and Silence, White City Blue by Tim Lott and the second volume of David Cairns's biography of Berlioz, Servitude and Greatness.",

Georges-Henri Beauthier, lawyer for six Chileans living in Belgium, said a decision by the cabinet was imminent after the foreign minister, Louis Michel, said he was determined that Pinochet should not walk free. The necessary papers had already been sent to the Belgian embassy in the Hague, seat of the ICJ. \"Everything has been done at the legal level, but the political decision still needs to be taken,\" Mr Beauthier said. In the Netherlands, an ICJ spokesperson said no request had yet been made by the Brussels government, but a hearing could be held as soon as Friday if an application was filed formally today. At the high court in London today, the Belgian government and six human rights groups will seek a judicial review of Jack Straw's announcement that he was \"minded\" to halt extradition proceedings against the general on health grounds. Belgium, one of four countries seeking to extradite the former dictator, has entered the legal fray after it failed to get a reply from two requests to the home office for a new medical examination and access to the Pinochet files. The ICJ case will argue that Mr Straw is in breach of international cooperation agreements because he failed to allow other states involved in the case access to Pinochet's medical reports, or to conduct their own independent medical tests of the 84-year-old general. The case will also include an application for provisional measures to ensure the home secretary takes no steps to allow Pinochet to return to Chile while the matter is before the British courts. In the wake of the Belgian move to the Hague, the home office said: \"We take our international obligations very seriously, but the home secretary must comply with UK law and rulings in the UK courts.\" Belgium has stepped to the fore in international attempts to stop Pinochet returning to Chile, a move which was commented on with some surprise and even pride in newspapers yesterday. \"Belgium is a little rebel, daring to defy the still imperial, though now Blairite, United Kingdom,\" commented Le Soir. \"Now look who is raising the banner of justice in the face of reasons of state.\" Although no side would confirm it, it is understood the Spanish and Belgian lawyers and Amnesty International's legal team have been working closely over the past two weeks to ensure Pinochet does not flee Britain for Chile.

      "body": "<p>Women will now be able to stop their biological clock and put babies on hold until their forties or fifties if they choose, following the lifting of the ban yesterday on the use of frozen eggs in fertility treatment.</p> <p>In a dramatic turnaround, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which is the regulatory body, said it would allow the procedure to be carried out in the UK.</p> <p>At least 50 women have had eggs removed and frozen in this country - mostly before treatment for cancer which would have made them infertile - but until now the HFEA has refused to let those eggs be fertilised and replaced for fear any babies would have chromosomal defects.</p> <p>Now, following a report from an independent expert, Sharon Paynter, on those babies born so far around the world from frozen eggs, the authority has concluded the procedure is safe although, in Dr Paynter's words, \"not without risk\". The HFEA stressed that this was an option that might help cancer patients.</p> <p>\"The HFEA has always been sympathetic to the plight of women suffering a serious illness, such as cancer, whose condition or treatment may prevent them producing eggs. We are pleased that we now have evidence giving hope to those women who could otherwise have been made infertile,\" said the chairman, Ruth Deech.</p> <p>The lifting of the ban will also allow career women without partners to freeze their eggs while they are young and at their most fertile - and use them when they want a family and when their chances of a baby would normally be slim.</p> <p>Yesterday's decision was greeted with delight by Mohammed Taranissi who runs the Assisted Reproduction and Gynaecology Centre in London. His clinic, which is one of only two licensed to freeze eggs in the UK, will now be licensed to thaw and use them.</p> <p><b> 'Success rate'</b> Mr Taranissi had threatened to take legal action against the HFEA on behalf of one of his clients, Carolyn Neill, 34, whose eggs were frozen before she underwent cancer treatment and who now wants to use them to try for a baby.</p> <p>\"We're very pleased,\" Mr Taranissi said yesterday. \"It confirms that what we have been saying all along is the right thing to do. We knew that the evidence was there.\"</p> <p>At a sister clinic in the USA, the Florida Institute for Reproductive Medicine, Mr Taranissi's colleagues have already produced about 17 babies, he said.</p> <p>\"We have probably the highest success rate in the world with this technique. We're still looking at small numbers but if you compare them to anybody's else's they look very promising.\" He hopes there will be a baby born in this country from a frozen egg before the end of the year.</p> <p>The HFEA says the procedure has very low success rates and would therefore appeal only to single women with no other option. Cancer patients with partners would be better off storing embryos, which freeze much more successfully than eggs.</p> <p>Jane Denton, HFEA deputy chairman, said it was vital that patients should have accurate information about their chances. \"It does appear that the chance of a live birth is between 1 and 10% - probably around 1%. It is vital people are fully appraised of that.\"</p> <p>But Mr Taranissi disputes those figures. \"Our pregnancy rate is about 50%,\" he said. \"If you freeze good quality eggs, you will have a good chance of success.\" The women who wanted their eggs frozen were young and they were not infertile. The only danger is that the eggs will be damaged by the freezing and thawing process.</p> <p>Mrs Denton agrees that is where the problems lie. \"The eggs that reach the stage where they fertilise are likely to result in a pregnancy, but very few seem to be fertilising,\" she said. She thought any eggs that were damaged would not fertilise or if they did, would probably miscarry.</p> <p>But the HFEA's fears that the freezing/thawing process could give rise to birth defects have been largely allayed by the evidence. Dr Paynter, from the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at University of Wales college of medicine in Cardiff, reported on 28 births - the first were twins in Singapore in 1986 - and found that all the babies were healthy. Even so, the HFEA says it will closely monitor the new technique.</p> <p>For all the caution of the HFEA, there are already women in this country who have chosen to freeze their eggs because they are not yet ready for a family and worry that they may face fertility problems by the time they want a baby. \"We have got about 10 career women in their early 30s who have frozen their eggs,\" said Mr Taranissi. \"It is not something I am personally very keen on, but once the door is open people will use it for whatever they like.\"</p> <p>He was surprised that the HFEA had lifted the ban completely. \"I wanted it to be restricted to cancer treatment. The HFEA has gone from one extreme to the other.\" There is now no bar, he said, on women donating their young and fertile eggs which could be kept frozen for use by someone else in the future.</p> <p>The next step for the scientists is the freezing and replacing of ovarian tissue or tiny, immature eggs, which would make it possible for pre-pubescent girls with cancer to have babies later.</p> <p><b>'Before, I never thought about having children but it's a part of anyone's life'</b></p> <p>Joanne Sprawson, 17, had hardly considered whether she would want children one day when she was faced with the dreadful possibility that she might never be able to have them, writes Sarah Boseley .</p> <p>The A-level student from Stalisfield Green in Kent was diagnosed with breast cancer in October.</p> <p>\"Before chemotherapy came up, I didn't even think about having kids, but when it did, I realised it is part of anyone's life,\" she said.</p> <p>It was a part she would have been denied if she had not been told of the egg storage facility at the Assisted Reproduction and Gynaecology Centre in London. In December, she had ten eggs removed and stored in liquid nitrogen.</p> <p>\"We were told about the law, but I thought I've got 10 or 15 years ahead of me before I want to have children. I thought the law might have been changed by then,\" she said.</p> <p>Her mother, Elaine Sprawson, 51, said: \"In Joanne's case, she has time on her side before she makes decisions about family life. But for women in their thirties it is vital that this opportunity is available to them.\"</p> <p>Carolyn Neill, 34, wants a baby, but chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer has destroyed her fertility. Last May, before she embarked on chemotherapy, she had nine of her eggs removed and frozen.</p> <p>She has now overcome the first hurdle to having children, her cancer is in remission. But there was a second - the ban by the HFEA on the use of frozen eggs.</p> <p>\"I was worried about infertility and thought this method would give me the chance to have children because I have always thought that I would have a family,\" she said at the time. \"It is so stressful to go through cancer and then have to face this. It is not right that the government can decide whether I have children or not.\"</p> <p>It was her case that Mohammed Taranissi of the Assisted Reproduction and Gynaecology Centre decided to fight, threatening to take the HFEA to judicial review. The authority maintains that it always had the situation under review, but public sympathy for Ms Neill's plight can only have been influential.</p> <p>There are two clinics with licences to freeze eggs. The other, Care at the Park hospital in Nottingham, has not yet begun to offer cryopreservation services. Its medical director Dr Ken Dowell called the change\"fantastic news\".</p> <p>His clinic is dealing with three women who have daughters born without ovaries. Their mothers, all in their mid-30s, want to give their daughters the chance of children when they grow up, by freezing their own eggs for donation later. If it works, the girls will give birth to their own half-brothers and sisters.</p> <p>Dr Dowell, unlike Dr Taranissi, believes the freezing technique is still hit and miss. \"If we were to collect 10 mature eggs, only half would survive freezing and thawing, and half of those would end up being fertilised. But like many other aspects of assisted reproduction, it will get much more efficient in the future,\" he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Women will now be able to stop their biological clock and put babies on hold until their forties or fifties if they choose, following the lifting of the ban yesterday on the use of frozen eggs in fertility treatment. In a dramatic turnaround, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which is the regulatory body, said it would allow the procedure to be carried out in the UK. At least 50 women have had eggs removed and frozen in this country - mostly before treatment for cancer which would have made them infertile - but until now the HFEA has refused to let those eggs be fertilised and replaced for fear any babies would have chromosomal defects. Now, following a report from an independent expert, Sharon Paynter, on those babies born so far around the world from frozen eggs, the authority has concluded the procedure is safe although, in Dr Paynter's words, \"not without risk\". The HFEA stressed that this was an option that might help cancer patients. \"The HFEA has always been sympathetic to the plight of women suffering a serious illness, such as cancer, whose condition or treatment may prevent them producing eggs. We are pleased that we now have evidence giving hope to those women who could otherwise have been made infertile,\" said the chairman, Ruth Deech. The lifting of the ban will also allow career women without partners to freeze their eggs while they are young and at their most fertile - and use them when they want a family and when their chances of a baby would normally be slim. Yesterday's decision was greeted with delight by Mohammed Taranissi who runs the Assisted Reproduction and Gynaecology Centre in London. His clinic, which is one of only two licensed to freeze eggs in the UK, will now be licensed to thaw and use them. 'Success rate' Mr Taranissi had threatened to take legal action against the HFEA on behalf of one of his clients, Carolyn Neill, 34, whose eggs were frozen before she underwent cancer treatment and who now wants to use them to try for a baby. \"We're very pleased,\" Mr Taranissi said yesterday. \"It confirms that what we have been saying all along is the right thing to do. We knew that the evidence was there.\" At a sister clinic in the USA, the Florida Institute for Reproductive Medicine, Mr Taranissi's colleagues have already produced about 17 babies, he said. \"We have probably the highest success rate in the world with this technique. We're still looking at small numbers but if you compare them to anybody's else's they look very promising.\" He hopes there will be a baby born in this country from a frozen egg before the end of the year. The HFEA says the procedure has very low success rates and would therefore appeal only to single women with no other option. Cancer patients with partners would be better off storing embryos, which freeze much more successfully than eggs. Jane Denton, HFEA deputy chairman, said it was vital that patients should have accurate information about their chances. \"It does appear that the chance of a live birth is between 1 and 10% - probably around 1%. It is vital people are fully appraised of that.\" But Mr Taranissi disputes those figures. \"Our pregnancy rate is about 50%,\" he said. \"If you freeze good quality eggs, you will have a good chance of success.\" The women who wanted their eggs frozen were young and they were not infertile. The only danger is that the eggs will be damaged by the freezing and thawing process. Mrs Denton agrees that is where the problems lie. \"The eggs that reach the stage where they fertilise are likely to result in a pregnancy, but very few seem to be fertilising,\" she said. She thought any eggs that were damaged would not fertilise or if they did, would probably miscarry. But the HFEA's fears that the freezing/thawing process could give rise to birth defects have been largely allayed by the evidence. Dr Paynter, from the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at University of Wales college of medicine in Cardiff, reported on 28 births - the first were twins in Singapore in 1986 - and found that all the babies were healthy. Even so, the HFEA says it will closely monitor the new technique. For all the caution of the HFEA, there are already women in this country who have chosen to freeze their eggs because they are not yet ready for a family and worry that they may face fertility problems by the time they want a baby. \"We have got about 10 career women in their early 30s who have frozen their eggs,\" said Mr Taranissi. \"It is not something I am personally very keen on, but once the door is open people will use it for whatever they like.\" He was surprised that the HFEA had lifted the ban completely. \"I wanted it to be restricted to cancer treatment. The HFEA has gone from one extreme to the other.\" There is now no bar, he said, on women donating their young and fertile eggs which could be kept frozen for use by someone else in the future. The next step for the scientists is the freezing and replacing of ovarian tissue or tiny, immature eggs, which would make it possible for pre-pubescent girls with cancer to have babies later. 'Before, I never thought about having children but it's a part of anyone's life' Joanne Sprawson, 17, had hardly considered whether she would want children one day when she was faced with the dreadful possibility that she might never be able to have them, writes Sarah Boseley . The A-level student from Stalisfield Green in Kent was diagnosed with breast cancer in October. \"Before chemotherapy came up, I didn't even think about having kids, but when it did, I realised it is part of anyone's life,\" she said. It was a part she would have been denied if she had not been told of the egg storage facility at the Assisted Reproduction and Gynaecology Centre in London. In December, she had ten eggs removed and stored in liquid nitrogen. \"We were told about the law, but I thought I've got 10 or 15 years ahead of me before I want to have children. I thought the law might have been changed by then,\" she said. Her mother, Elaine Sprawson, 51, said: \"In Joanne's case, she has time on her side before she makes decisions about family life. But for women in their thirties it is vital that this opportunity is available to them.\" Carolyn Neill, 34, wants a baby, but chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer has destroyed her fertility. Last May, before she embarked on chemotherapy, she had nine of her eggs removed and frozen. She has now overcome the first hurdle to having children, her cancer is in remission. But there was a second - the ban by the HFEA on the use of frozen eggs. \"I was worried about infertility and thought this method would give me the chance to have children because I have always thought that I would have a family,\" she said at the time. \"It is so stressful to go through cancer and then have to face this. It is not right that the government can decide whether I have children or not.\" It was her case that Mohammed Taranissi of the Assisted Reproduction and Gynaecology Centre decided to fight, threatening to take the HFEA to judicial review. The authority maintains that it always had the situation under review, but public sympathy for Ms Neill's plight can only have been influential. There are two clinics with licences to freeze eggs. The other, Care at the Park hospital in Nottingham, has not yet begun to offer cryopreservation services. Its medical director Dr Ken Dowell called the change\"fantastic news\". His clinic is dealing with three women who have daughters born without ovaries. Their mothers, all in their mid-30s, want to give their daughters the chance of children when they grow up, by freezing their own eggs for donation later. If it works, the girls will give birth to their own half-brothers and sisters. Dr Dowell, unlike Dr Taranissi, believes the freezing technique is still hit and miss. \"If we were to collect 10 mature eggs, only half would survive freezing and thawing, and half of those would end up being fertilised. But like many other aspects of assisted reproduction, it will get much more efficient in the future,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "A television documentary maker had his career destroyed by newspaper allegations that a programme on a high level conspiracy between the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries to murder IRA suspects was a hoax, a high court libel jury heard yesterday. Sean McPhilemy, whose company, Box Productions, made the 1991 Channel 4 Dispatches programme called The Committee, was robbed of his livelihood when the Sunday Times said his programme was a deception, his counsel, James Price QC, told the London court. The newspaper said the film makers \"stand accused of producing little more than a collage of unsubstantiated rumours and fabrications\". Mr Price told Mr Justice Eady and the jury of six men and six women: \"This accusation has meant that people who commission current affairs programmes no longer want anything to do with Mr McPhilemy.\" The Sunday Times denies libelling Mr McPhilemy in its May 1993 article headlined Film on Ulster death squads a hoax. Mr Price said the arrest of Brian Nelson, chief intelligence officer of the paramilitary Ulster Defence Association, who was also working for British army intelligence, revived widespread rumours that murders of IRA suspects were being committed with the collusion of the army, the RUC and the Ulster Defence Regiment. \"The question is whether it involved a few bad apples or was more widespread and institutionalised and reached into the higher ranks of the security forces,\" he said. Mr McPhilemy's documentary was based on an interview with a loyalist \"fanatic\", James Sands, who was involved in the Ulster independence movement and said he had inside knowledge of collusion in the assassination of IRA men and in the revenge killings of Catholics. In its article, the Sunday Times said Mr Sands claimed he was promised \u00a35,000 to recite a prepared script and that he did not know whether what he was saying was true or not. It also said another participant was also paid to recite a script. Mr Price said Mr McPhilemy was convinced that Mr Sands was telling the truth and would give his reasons in the witness box. \"Sands may have been telling the truth or he may not have been telling the truth,\" Mr Price said. \"He might have succeeded in pulling the wool over the eyes of the programme makers. But that is a completely different question and is not what the libel trial is about. \"Did Sean McPhilemy and the other programme makers collude with Sands to produce a hoax, a charade, a fraud?\" He said the jury had to decide whether Mr McPhilemy was honest or whether he was a party to paying witnesses to recite a script. In order for the programme to be a hoax, all those present would have had to have been in on it, Mr Price said. The original film showed that there was no prompting of Mr Sands, Mr Price told the jury. On the table in front of Mr Sands lay a copy of a magazine, not a script, he added.",

      "body": "<p>Ken Livingstone, according to Tony Blair, represents the splits and extremism of the early 80s, hence Blair's extraordinary campaign to frustrate Livingstone's mayoral ambitions. Which is odd, because those of us charged with the doomed task of trying to make Labour electable in the early 80s remember very clearly those politicians whose every utterance seemed designed to make our efforts pointless; and in our demonology, Livingstone comes below many people who are now ministers and New Labour advisers.</p> <p>I was a Labour party press officer in 1983. (I have made an almost complete recovery now, and thank you for asking.) I was also part of the tiny team which ran John Silkin's unsuccessful leadership and deputy leadership bids, and of the much larger team which organised Neil Kinnock's successful 1983 leadership campaign. Ken Livingstone wasn't my favourite politician, but it was clear that his Fares Fair policy was one of Labour's few pluses among London voters.</p> <p>Other politicians were far more divisive. Take Chris Mullin, who became editor of Tribune in 1982 (defeating Kinnock's candidate, who happened to be me). One week the paper broadly supported the leftwing Tribune Group and Michael Foot's leadership; the next it condemned Foot and campaigned to smash apart the Tribune Group because it had, apparently, proved itself unfit to carry the banner of the left by its failure to support Tony Benn, and was full of hopeless reactionaries like Foot and Kinnock. John Silkin led the fightback by the old Tribuneites, and Mullin embarked on a speaking tour of Silkin's Deptford constituency calling for Silkin to be deselected.</p> <p>Mullin is now doing his penance in the form of privatising air traffic control. It is hard to resist the idea that the job was specially chosen to give this former rigid ideological socialist the chance to prove he was willing to abase himself. Or take Paul Boateng. One of the bitterest selection battles was in the Conservative marginal of Hemel Hempstead, held for Labour until 1979 by Robin Corbett.

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone, according to Tony Blair, represents the splits and extremism of the early 80s, hence Blair's extraordinary campaign to frustrate Livingstone's mayoral ambitions. Which is odd, because those of us charged with the doomed task of trying to make Labour electable in the early 80s remember very clearly those politicians whose every utterance seemed designed to make our efforts pointless; and in our demonology, Livingstone comes below many people who are now ministers and New Labour advisers. I was a Labour party press officer in 1983. (I have made an almost complete recovery now, and thank you for asking.) I was also part of the tiny team which ran John Silkin's unsuccessful leadership and deputy leadership bids, and of the much larger team which organised Neil Kinnock's successful 1983 leadership campaign. Ken Livingstone wasn't my favourite politician, but it was clear that his Fares Fair policy was one of Labour's few pluses among London voters. Other politicians were far more divisive. Take Chris Mullin, who became editor of Tribune in 1982 (defeating Kinnock's candidate, who happened to be me). One week the paper broadly supported the leftwing Tribune Group and Michael Foot's leadership; the next it condemned Foot and campaigned to smash apart the Tribune Group because it had, apparently, proved itself unfit to carry the banner of the left by its failure to support Tony Benn, and was full of hopeless reactionaries like Foot and Kinnock. John Silkin led the fightback by the old Tribuneites, and Mullin embarked on a speaking tour of Silkin's Deptford constituency calling for Silkin to be deselected. Mullin is now doing his penance in the form of privatising air traffic control. It is hard to resist the idea that the job was specially chosen to give this former rigid ideological socialist the chance to prove he was willing to abase himself. Or take Paul Boateng. One of the bitterest selection battles was in the Conservative marginal of Hemel Hempstead, held for Labour until 1979 by Robin Corbett. Corbett then lost a bruising two-year deselection battle to Boateng, who condemned Corbett for being a white, middle-class reactionary. By the end of the selection battle, he had used such immoderate language that no Labour candidate stood a chance: at the general election, Boateng came a poor third. Today you can see treasury minister Boateng nodding sonorously in the background whenever the prime minister speaks in parliament. The lower ranks of government are stuffed full of people like Mullin and Boateng, who were fiercely partisan leftwing rebels during the early 80s; and many of Livingstone's old GLC colleagues are now New Labour trusties.

Since the prime minister is avoiding any personal hint of triumphalism by having a normal working day, the task of blowing the government's trumpet will fall to the education secretary, David Blunkett, a trusted Blair lieutenant. Sweeping aside the fainthearts, he will characterise the Blair administration as \"more confident, more radical, delivering more than we said we would\". Mr Blunkett will parade the Blairites' pro-business, pro-European credentials by making his speech to the German/British chamber of industry and commerce at Claridge's Hotel in Mayfair. That may niggle patient Labour loyalists and in the present climate of voter disappointment over key public services, Mr Blunkett will stress that there is still \"a lot more to do\". William Hague will today liken the government to a vacuous Millennium Dome, saying: \"It has all turned out to be talk.\" Last night shadow ministers attacked the government over stealth taxes, NHS waiting lists and Labour's \"audit of failures, lies, sleaze and hypocrisy\".

      "trailText": "<p>Fiftysomething white Hollywood supremo Michael Ovitz has announced he's getting into hip-hop. It's not the first time the establishment has hijacked African-American culture for profit. And it won't be the last. By  Mark Morris</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Michael Ovitz is the Hollywood elite personified. At the age of 29, he founded the mighty Creative Artists Agency, and used \"talent packages\" to make agents as powerful as their clients. He's a friend of the stars, a noted philanthropist and the man behind an attempt to bring a new National Football League team to LA. He slipped up once, spending an unhappy year as president of Disney, but even then, he came away with a $90 million golden handshake and set up a new company - Artists Management Group - which looks after Martin Scorsese and Robin Williams. </p> <p>But when you're as successful as Mike, you know that times change. At the age of 53, Ovitz has seen the future, and that future is hip-hop. He's taken a look at the US pop charts and seen: hip-hop. And riding high at the US box office? Ice Cube's Next Friday. Michael Ovitz wants in \"I want to try to learn this whole urban marketing situation\", Ovitz said stiffly last week, announcing the formation of AMG's new \"urban entertainment division\". \"I see big crossover potential in films, in sports and everything else.\" Urban, in case you were wondering, is marketing speak for African-American. The man Ovitz has hooked with to help him show much love for the homies is Chris Lightly, head of Violator Management, who look after - among others - rapper duo Mobb Deep. Ovitz credits Lightly with being a genius at \"guerrilla marketing\". </p> <p>The oldest myth in the music business is that black musicians come up with the all the ideas, and white people make all the money. And it has certainly happened enough times to have a ring of truth, although ask George Michael and he would be quick to point out that managers and record companies are out to stiff everyone, black, brown or white. </p> <p>Niggaz With Attitude might have seemed the essence of cultural autonomy, with the late Eazy E doubling as rapper and president of their label, Ruthless. But the other members - including the formidable pairing of Ice Cube and Dr Dre - believed that the purse strings were controlled by Eazy's fiftysomething manager, Jerry Heller. Whether Heller was ripping them off or not, the feeling that he was tore apart the group. Dre joined up with former football player and gang member Marion \"Suge\" Knight, whose business methods allegedly included dangling people from hotel balconies. According to Ronin Ro's terrifying Have Gun Will Travel: The Spectacular Rise And Violent Fall Of Death Row Records, Knight threatened and harassed Heller until he let Dr Dre out of his contract. And although Dre later fell out with Knight, who is currently serving time for parole violations, the surviving members of the group remain convinced that Heller is the villain of the NWA story. Conspiracy theorists even maintain that Knight was brought down because he was a successful black businessman, not because he was - as Ro's book suggests - a sadist who tortured his employees. </p> <p>But even a black-owned business like Death Row was reliant on a distribution deal with Interscope Records, run by Jimmy Iovine, bombastic rock producer to the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Simple Minds. Despite the high profile of black music business executives like Def Jam/Rush Management's Russell Simmons, No Limit's Master P and, of course, Bad Boy supremo Puff Daddy, a shrinking number of multinationals control the business, and their higher echelons remain predominantly white. As is the audience which buys hardcore rap's tales of bitches, blunts, beatdowns and AK-47s. The trick is making sure a performer is accepted as \"keeping it real\" by the trendsetting, impoverished inner-city black audience. Once this credibility is established, then white-owned companies can market young black men and women to the voyeuristic suburban white teens who keep the entertainment industry buoyant. Rappers resent it, the anti-semitic myths grow and grow, but the dollars keep flowing. </p> <p>The spirals can give you a headache. On Brooklyn rapper Mos Def's recent album Black On Both Sides, there is a track called Rock N Roll, which tries to reassert guitar pop's African origins: \"Elvis Presley ain't got no soul/Bo Diddley is rock'n'roll\" Mos claims. Black On Both Sides is an intelligent, political album with a lot to say about racism and the accumulation of power by corporations. It is released by the \"independent\" New York label Rawkus, which was founded in the early 90s by three young men, including one James Murdoch. After a couple of years, Murdoch sold a stake in Rawkus to his dad. The best political rap records of recent times have come to us courtesy of Rupert Murdoch. </p> <p>There was another unlikely hip-hop related product Murdoch funded: Bulworth, Warren Beatty's satire about an ageing Californian establishment figure whose complete breakdown is symbolised by the fact that he starts rapping. There's nothing - Warren was saying - more ridiculous than a rich white man gone ghetto fabulous. And as Michael Ovitz goes urban, he should know that while his new clients will appreciate his money-making powers, they'll never trust him.</p>",

But when you're as successful as Mike, you know that times change. At the age of 53, Ovitz has seen the future, and that future is hip-hop. He's taken a look at the US pop charts and seen: hip-hop. And riding high at the US box office? Ice Cube's Next Friday. Michael Ovitz wants in \"I want to try to learn this whole urban marketing situation\", Ovitz said stiffly last week, announcing the formation of AMG's new \"urban entertainment division\". \"I see big crossover potential in films, in sports and everything else.\" Urban, in case you were wondering, is marketing speak for African-American. The man Ovitz has hooked with to help him show much love for the homies is Chris Lightly, head of Violator Management, who look after - among others - rapper duo Mobb Deep. Ovitz credits Lightly with being a genius at \"guerrilla marketing\". The oldest myth in the music business is that black musicians come up with the all the ideas, and white people make all the money. And it has certainly happened enough times to have a ring of truth, although ask George Michael and he would be quick to point out that managers and record companies are out to stiff everyone, black, brown or white. Niggaz With Attitude might have seemed the essence of cultural autonomy, with the late Eazy E doubling as rapper and president of their label, Ruthless. But the other members - including the formidable pairing of Ice Cube and Dr Dre - believed that the purse strings were controlled by Eazy's fiftysomething manager, Jerry Heller. Whether Heller was ripping them off or not, the feeling that he was tore apart the group. Dre joined up with former football player and gang member Marion \"Suge\" Knight, whose business methods allegedly included dangling people from hotel balconies. According to Ronin Ro's terrifying Have Gun Will Travel: The Spectacular Rise And Violent Fall Of Death Row Records, Knight threatened and harassed Heller until he let Dr Dre out of his contract. And although Dre later fell out with Knight, who is currently serving time for parole violations, the surviving members of the group remain convinced that Heller is the villain of the NWA story. Conspiracy theorists even maintain that Knight was brought down because he was a successful black businessman, not because he was - as Ro's book suggests - a sadist who tortured his employees. But even a black-owned business like Death Row was reliant on a distribution deal with Interscope Records, run by Jimmy Iovine, bombastic rock producer to the likes of Bruce Springsteen and Simple Minds. Despite the high profile of black music business executives like Def Jam/Rush Management's Russell Simmons, No Limit's Master P and, of course, Bad Boy supremo Puff Daddy, a shrinking number of multinationals control the business, and their higher echelons remain predominantly white. As is the audience which buys hardcore rap's tales of bitches, blunts, beatdowns and AK-47s. The trick is making sure a performer is accepted as \"keeping it real\" by the trendsetting, impoverished inner-city black audience. Once this credibility is established, then white-owned companies can market young black men and women to the voyeuristic suburban white teens who keep the entertainment industry buoyant. Rappers resent it, the anti-semitic myths grow and grow, but the dollars keep flowing. The spirals can give you a headache. On Brooklyn rapper Mos Def's recent album Black On Both Sides, there is a track called Rock N Roll, which tries to reassert guitar pop's African origins: \"Elvis Presley ain't got no soul/Bo Diddley is rock'n'roll\" Mos claims. Black On Both Sides is an intelligent, political album with a lot to say about racism and the accumulation of power by corporations. It is released by the \"independent\" New York label Rawkus, which was founded in the early 90s by three young men, including one James Murdoch. After a couple of years, Murdoch sold a stake in Rawkus to his dad. The best political rap records of recent times have come to us courtesy of Rupert Murdoch. There was another unlikely hip-hop related product Murdoch funded: Bulworth, Warren Beatty's satire about an ageing Californian establishment figure whose complete breakdown is symbolised by the fact that he starts rapping. There's nothing - Warren was saying - more ridiculous than a rich white man gone ghetto fabulous. And as Michael Ovitz goes urban, he should know that while his new clients will appreciate his money-making powers, they'll never trust him.",

A statement from Sami Ahmed and J A G Knight, who worked for the company up until 1994, said \"grants were correctly and fully accounted for and all procedures relating to them were properly observed\". The move comes after the company's former chief accountant, Max Ayriss, claimed at the weekend that Mr Robinson obtained a \u00a330,000 grant from the department of trade and industry to buy a factory building which he was not planning to occupy and simply wanted to let. Mr Ayriss said that while the claim may not have been strictly illegal, it was clearly against the spirit of the DTI regional grants which were intended to help new businesses. The DTI announced at the weekend that it would be investigating \"serious allegations\" made by Mr Ayriss and the company's former sales manager Peter Dickinson about the way it obtained DTI grants totalling \u00a3400,000 in the late 1980s. However last night's statement said: \"We write to refute the aspersions cast by Messrs Ayriss and Dickinson on the propriety with which DTI product development contracts were carried out whilst we were employed as directors of Transfer Technology Limited (TransTec) in the relevant periods. These grants were correctly and fully accounted for and all procedures relating to them were properly observed. \"The DTI not only inspected and approved all claims submitted, which were in turn vetted by our auditors, as required, but also thoroughly evaluated the work carried out and the equipment developed.\" The Commons speaker Betty Boothroyd yesterday chided the DTI for dragging its feet over answering opposition questions about the collapse of TransTec. The first batch from a total of 19 questions ought to have been answered last Thursday. The DTI said it expected to supply answers today. Receivers Arthur Andersen are drawing up plans for a meeting of creditors owed, on one estimate, \u00a3300m.",

      "body": "<p>Alphonse Boudard, who has died aged 74, was one of the most original and impressive French novelists of the last 40 years. He was not an intellectual writing novels which explored ideas. He wrote directly and forcefully about life as he had lived and witnessed it. All his works contain reminiscence. He was, as he put it, always wandering in the past, \"en promenade r\u00e9tro.\" </p> <p>It could hardly have been otherwise. Boudard was born in in the 13th arondissement of Paris - not the sort of place where tourists set foot. His mother was a 17-year-old prostitute, who packed him off to some peasants in the Loiret. Aged seven, he was brought back to Paris, where he was looked after by his grandmother. He went to a local school and became apprenticed to a typesetter. \"I knew my letters before I knew my words,\" was how he described this achievement at the age of 14. </p> <p>Boudard's wanderings in German-occupied Paris became organised when he joined the resistance, working under the command of Pierre Georges, known as \"Colonel Fabien\", the legendary communist martyr, whose unit was made up of working-class men, mainly from Paris, and sections of the army. After the liberation of the city, this force was taken under the command of General de Lattre de Tassigny, and moved towards Strasbourg and the Rhine. Boudard was twice wounded, and although he apparently refused to accept the Military Medal, he was decorated with the Croix de Guerre and cited several times for bravery. </p> <p>He left the army as soon as he could, but seemed unable to settle to any occupation. He sold pornography, dealt in counterfeit money, and became a specialist in robbing funeral businesses. The result was prison and, although he was pardoned because of outstanding war services, he was to go back to jail later. But tuberculosis struck him and, from 1948 to the 1960s, he divided his time between prison and hospital. It was then that he began to read, widely and wildly. And it was in 1958 that he began to write his first novel. </p> <p>Boudard's subjects were those that he knew - fighting, serving time in prison, being ill. The characters were the companions whom he remembered. Most important, perhaps, the language was that of his former companions. Boudard him self claimed to be bilingual in French and \"argot\", or French slang, a language that is particularly imaginative and picturesque. He wanted it to be recognised by the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise and, in 1998, co-authored a book in which he explained his ideas about argot. </p> <p>Boudard liked to go against the accepted idea. To him, not all bourgeois were selfish and unattractive, not all members of the resistance were heroic, not all beggars were to be recommended. This sometimes displeased readers. When, for example, he wrote about two young men in the resistance hitching lifts from \"les Fritz\", being searched by \"le grand Teuton\" for propaganda leaflets, admiring \"les Amerlogues\" who stank of chewing gum, petrol and special cigarettes, it was said that this was not how it really was in Colonel Fabien's unit. But this was Boudard's anthology of his experiences. </p> <p>He won the Prix Sainte Beuve for his prison novel, La Cerise (1963), and the Prix Renaudot for Les Combattants du Petit Bonheur (1977), about the resistance. He wrote scenarios for films, and several of his books were adapted for the cinema. </p> <p>A new novel, Les Trois Mamans du Petit J\u00e9sus, due to appear shortly, describes how Jesus, as a baby, is abandoned on the steps of a brothel and is tended by three mothers. It promises to be very Boudardien, since the brothel in question is one which he knew, and since the idea of motherhood was a fundamental part of his experience. He had visions of \"Mademoiselle ma m\u00e8re,\" the young blonde mother who had abandoned him and whom he hoped to meet in heaven. </p> <p>Boudard is survived by his wife and two sons. </p> <p>Alphonse Boudard, writer, born December 17 1925; died January 14 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Alphonse Boudard, who has died aged 74, was one of the most original and impressive French novelists of the last 40 years. He was not an intellectual writing novels which explored ideas. He wrote directly and forcefully about life as he had lived and witnessed it. All his works contain reminiscence. He was, as he put it, always wandering in the past, \"en promenade r\u00e9tro.\" It could hardly have been otherwise. Boudard was born in in the 13th arondissement of Paris - not the sort of place where tourists set foot. His mother was a 17-year-old prostitute, who packed him off to some peasants in the Loiret. Aged seven, he was brought back to Paris, where he was looked after by his grandmother. He went to a local school and became apprenticed to a typesetter. \"I knew my letters before I knew my words,\" was how he described this achievement at the age of 14. Boudard's wanderings in German-occupied Paris became organised when he joined the resistance, working under the command of Pierre Georges, known as \"Colonel Fabien\", the legendary communist martyr, whose unit was made up of working-class men, mainly from Paris, and sections of the army. After the liberation of the city, this force was taken under the command of General de Lattre de Tassigny, and moved towards Strasbourg and the Rhine. Boudard was twice wounded, and although he apparently refused to accept the Military Medal, he was decorated with the Croix de Guerre and cited several times for bravery. He left the army as soon as he could, but seemed unable to settle to any occupation. He sold pornography, dealt in counterfeit money, and became a specialist in robbing funeral businesses. The result was prison and, although he was pardoned because of outstanding war services, he was to go back to jail later. But tuberculosis struck him and, from 1948 to the 1960s, he divided his time between prison and hospital. It was then that he began to read, widely and wildly. And it was in 1958 that he began to write his first novel. Boudard's subjects were those that he knew - fighting, serving time in prison, being ill. The characters were the companions whom he remembered. Most important, perhaps, the language was that of his former companions. Boudard him self claimed to be bilingual in French and \"argot\", or French slang, a language that is particularly imaginative and picturesque. He wanted it to be recognised by the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise and, in 1998, co-authored a book in which he explained his ideas about argot. Boudard liked to go against the accepted idea. To him, not all bourgeois were selfish and unattractive, not all members of the resistance were heroic, not all beggars were to be recommended. This sometimes displeased readers. When, for example, he wrote about two young men in the resistance hitching lifts from \"les Fritz\", being searched by \"le grand Teuton\" for propaganda leaflets, admiring \"les Amerlogues\" who stank of chewing gum, petrol and special cigarettes, it was said that this was not how it really was in Colonel Fabien's unit. But this was Boudard's anthology of his experiences. He won the Prix Sainte Beuve for his prison novel, La Cerise (1963), and the Prix Renaudot for Les Combattants du Petit Bonheur (1977), about the resistance. He wrote scenarios for films, and several of his books were adapted for the cinema. A new novel, Les Trois Mamans du Petit J\u00e9sus, due to appear shortly, describes how Jesus, as a baby, is abandoned on the steps of a brothel and is tended by three mothers. It promises to be very Boudardien, since the brothel in question is one which he knew, and since the idea of motherhood was a fundamental part of his experience. He had visions of \"Mademoiselle ma m\u00e8re,\" the young blonde mother who had abandoned him and whom he hoped to meet in heaven. Boudard is survived by his wife and two sons. Alphonse Boudard, writer, born December 17 1925; died January 14 2000",

From the outside there is little to give away the building's real purpose. Rising out of a featureless landscape, it is a matt-black block with a single entrance, surrounded by a fence and security cameras. Patrolled around the clock, it is designed to withstand the worst terrorist onslaught. It looks like the sort of Nevada desert facility that Mulder and Scully are always breaking into. But if the internet is characterised by any place in Britain, this is it.</p> <p>Silicon Fen may be the creative home of the net, but this is the physical. This is Telehouse, in the murky middle of London's Docklands. It was the first place in Britain to provide a facility for net companies to house their servers - the boxes which contain the information that makes up the website. The building, open 24 hours a day, hosts 350 companies, hundreds of miles of wire, generators, emergency electrical supplies and without it, the British internet might not exist.</p> <p>\"It's not a people place,\" admits Telehouse sales and client support manager Michelle Reid. Once out of the small admin building (the only place where you actually see any of the 80 people who work there), you enter the main block through sealed capsules, a door closing behind you and another slowly opening in front. Inside, long corridors are empty of staff, bereft of posters and all but free of windows.</p> <p>This is the way it works: when you log on to, for example, the net supplier Demon, your computer dials in to the Demon \"server\", which then takes you to the page you want to go. The server, normally a dull-looking grey box about the size of a small filing cabinet, lives in Telehouse. It is, if you like, a net warehouse.</p> <p>Telehouse was the first and, of course, it happened by accident. Set up in 1990 as a disaster recovery centre for the finance world, it still houses a fully equipped dealing room ready to receive pinstripe-shirted traders evacuated from disaster-hit premises in the City. Then the net happened and now all the major UK internet service providers (ISPs) store their servers in the complex - companies such as Demon, for example and even the Guardian.</p> <p>Although it may look dull, this is the future. You might be able to set up an e-commerce business in your bedroom, but as soon as you make any real money and you need to start storing real data about real people, your flat will no longer do. Computer equipment may be getting smaller, but it still uses the same power. The more computers you put in one room, the more power they need. Not forgetting telecommunication links, security and emergency power.</p> <p>In the Telehouse basement, huge emergency diesel generators recall the engine room of a great liner. In one room there are banks of yellow batteries, in another, huge transformers marked \"WARNING 11,000 volts\".</p> <p>Spencer Reynolds, the shift supervisor, is one of the few people around. In charge of the power supply, he works in an office with the generator switches, which live in wood-panelled cabinets. \"This is one job that couldn't be done by computer,\" he says confidently. \"If there's an emergency, you'll always need a human to override the system.\"</p> <p>And the net itself? It's upstairs on huge floors divided by windowed walls - 165,000 sq ft across two buildings. Rows of cabinets house the servers, black units which look like the amplifiers on expensive stereo separates. Wires are everywhere - red, yellow, blue and green, contrasting with the battleship-grey of the cabinets and modems. It's all owned by the individual companies - all Telehouse provides is the location. Nobody knows how much wire is in the building, although one client did lay 7 miles in one weekend.</p> <p>Demon stores some of its equipment at Telehouse for security reasons. \"Telehouse is a very secure building,\" says the net supplier's internet expert Richard Clayton. And it's important - the memory chips alone (the official term is Random Access Memory, or RAM) are worth a fortune. \"You can't drive a car bomb into it. But then there is a market in RAM. I imagine the memory in that building must be worth a lot of money.\"</p> <p>In one of the sealed rooms, Keith Mitchell works on the LINX machines. LINX stands for London Internet Exchange and is owned by a cooperative of 90 British internet companies. If Telehouse is the equivalent of Clapham junction, LINX is the signal box. It provides the physical connections for service providers to talk to each other.</p> <p>It's the busiest net exchange in Europe, and bases its equipment mainly at Telehouse. \"We're a high- profile target,\" says Mitchell, who is chairman of LINX. \"We had some Russian hackers poking around our servers on New Year's Eve.\" By \"poking around\" he means they tried to get in to the server to muck around with some of the companies who use LINX. They were swiftly ejected and wouldn't have been able to do much damage anyway, says Mitchell.</p> <p>The business of storing the net is worth serious money. Telehouse charges around \u00a35,000 a year for a rack, which is actually a big cabinet, just over 6ft high. New kid Redbus Interhouse, aiming specifically at small start-ups, charges \u00a3250 a month and allows users to rent space on a short-term basis.</p> <p>But even in a place as controlled as Telehouse, the potential for disaster is ever-present. Not too long ago, one engineer flicked a switch in the wrong direction. Nobody died but servers and net companies went down for a short time. Reid is keen to point out that it couldn't happen again, but for such a new industry, people have long memories. \"You need the experience to provide this sort of facility,\" she says.</p> <p>But the reality is that it's not a regulated industry and nobody could have predicted the current popularity of the net in the UK. Telehouse didn't - it has reached full capacity and is frantically trying to expand. \"They just didn't build it big enough,\" says one insider. It's a business that's only going to grow. As well as Redbus Interhouse, Telecity and London Switch have recently set up nearby.</p> <p>But perhaps the most important feature of these places is that they remind us that the net is a tangible thing.

      "bodyText": "Age: 37. Occupation: Stockroom boy-turned-rich himbo, grandson of Green Shield stamps founder Richard Tompkins. Linked with almost every unattached supermodel in the past 15 years, now reportedly engaged to Claudia Schiffer. Appearance: \"Matinee idol looks\", coo the tabloids, maintained by workouts at Mayfair's Bath and Racquets club (\u00a33,000pa) and a wardrobe said to contain 120 Savile Row suits. \"I adore luxury,\" he has said. \"I love beauty in all its forms: in clothing, cars, houses and art.\" Heir? By celebrity crimper Michaeljohn. No, silly, how does he fund his extravagance? Sorry. A \u00a3500,000 windfall for his 21st birthday from his grandfather catapulted him from East Grinstead obscurity to the top of cafe society. Trash with cash, then? Don't be mean. He was cut out of his grandfather's \u00a335m will. Shame. Not all happy families? No. Tim's engagement, aged 21, to soft-porn star Koo Stark angered his mother Hilary: \"If Koo wasn't acceptable for Prince Andrew, I don't see why she should be good enough for my boy.\" Hilary's anger was not without foundation - Tim and his sister Nicola had refused to give their mother a share of the proceeds from the sale of the family home. Tim and Koo married, but split after a year. Single again. Yes. And Koo was only the first in a line of silly names: Elle Macpherson, Max Factor's Ines Sastre, Belgian Ingrid Seynhaeve, and pop stars Lisa B and Kylie Minogue followed - all far removed from his first love, Judy Hughesdon, a dry cleaners' sales assistant. You've got to hand it to the guy. Not if you're AA Gill, who once said: \"He's the sort of man you want to take outside and do really appalling things to with acid and a baseball bat.\" Nasty.

      "body": "<b> \"Conversazione\" at the Royal Society of Medicine, Wednesday, 6pm</b> <p>\"Bloody tube, sorry.\" It's not been the greatest of days for Ken Livingstone. The London Evening Standard's first edition leads on \"Brown lays into wrecker Ken\"; the second edition switches its focus to \"Blair in crushing attack on Red Ken\". Meanwhile, the Guardian has devoted two broadsheet pages to \"the case against Ken Livingstone\" - in short, why vote for a sad, lonely, conceited, economically illiterate monomaniac lefty? </p> <p>Livingstone shambles in with his drone of an apology. You'd be forgiven for thinking he's crushed by the day's coverage. Depressed even, to borrow some black propaganda from this black farce of an election. Actually, he's elated. Anyway, this must be the only election where you score brownie points for being late. Transport is the issue. </p> <p>As soon as he has named and shamed the tube and reeled off a couple of one-liners, he has the upwardly cerebral of the medical world eating out of his hand. He tells the audience gathered for tonight's \"conversazione\" that he's surprised they've turned out in such numbers when there's a far more exciting meeting going on across town, where the prime minister and chancellor are uniting to tell the electorate why Livingstone is a liability. </p> <p>He quickly turns his attention to the NHS. Livingstone doesn't need to savage the health service because Blair's placemen have already done it for him over the past few days. He ingeniously weaves together health and transport to show how ill-prepared the government is for the unexpected. \"It was the wrong kind of flu, wasn't it? Just like having the wrong leaves on the track... that's why the nearest intensive-care beds are in Sheffield.\" </p> <p>\"Do you remember the trolley buses - how clean they were?\" asks an urbane chap swathed in gravitas. Livingstone is in his element. Transport, hygiene, and nostalgia all wrapped in one cosy question. \"Trolley buses were clean because people cleaned them. The first thing they did when they privatised the buses was sack the cleaners.\" </p> <p>He talks about the good old days when men in pinstripes and bowler hats shared the buses. \"Now they can't go to work on the bus because they'd never be sure that they'd get there. Now the buses are for the poorest and powerless.\" The good old days when there were conductors, the good old days when every park had a parkie, when every tube had a guard, when there were no homeless on the streets and everyone had a proper job. </p> <p>Rather than the hammer-headed revolutionary of Millbank mythology, Livingstone comes across as a mellow pub nostalgist. Perhaps it's not that surprising. He was born at the same time as the welfare state. Today Labour politicians talk of public-private partnerships, viable health insurance, compulsory work schemes. No wonder he looks back with anger and regret. </p> <p> <b> The journey to Wimbledon</b> </p> <p> \"I've not been this knackered since the year they disbanded the GLC in 1986,\" says Livingstone. He has been campaigning to be Labour's candidate for mayor of London for 11 months now, and it's amazing he's still standing - in every sense. After all, the Labour party almost barred him from the selection process twice because he didn't support the then party policy on selling off part of the tube to Railtrack. Frank Dobson is expected to start with a 35% advantage (as well as virtually all the MPs, the AEEU engineering union and one Co-op party, both of which are refusing to ballot members, have pledged their support), but Livingstone is, astonishingly, the favourite to win. </p> <p>He is gliding down the escalator, smiles to the left, smiles to the right, arms holding his newspaper aloft like a trophy: \"Blair in crushing attack on Red Ken.\" Vanity isn't quite the right word. He is totally lacking in self-consciousness. This is Livingstone's home ground, everyday London. He is part of the furniture of the capital. People stop to say hello, or to wish him luck, or ask him about the bloody tube. No one looks surprised to see him. \"If you don't like being recognised, if you don't like talking to people, there's no point in being in this game,\" he says. </p> <p>I ask whether he prefers the Brown or Blair headline. \"Oh definitely Blair. Always go for the boss man.\" </p> <p>The man sitting opposite us wants to know if he can ask a question: \"Have I got anything to fear from you, Ken?\" We've reached Wimbledon, and it's time to get off. \"How do I know you, personally, have changed?\" the man asks as we leave. Livingstone apologises and says if he hadn't changed in 20 years, if he hadn't learned from his mistakes, there wouldn't be much hope for him. </p> <p>But it's a good question. How has he changed? \"If I go back and read the things I wrote, they're very jargony, economically illiterate, humorless. Twenty years on, I've got to have more confidence to tell those people who are idiots that they are being idiots.\" It's an arrogant, invincible answer. I ask him again how has he changed as a person, and he doesn't answer. </p> <p>We are walking down Wimbledon Broadway. He says that when he first heard Dobson was standing for mayor he thought he didn't have a chance; as well as having the cabinet's backing, Dobson was popular among traditional Labour voters. But Livingstone believes the government's handling of the election has scuppered Dobson's chances. He asks if I received one of the letters Labour MPs sent out to constituents telling them why they had to vote for Frank. \"They were sent out to all the London MPs, who were told that all they had to do was put their name to it and everything else would be sorted out by Downing Street. They even wrote to me asking if I'd send out a letter to constituents telling them why they had to back Frank, and why we didn't want a return to the bad old days. You know, we got \u00a34,000 in small donations after they sent those letters out.\" </p> <p>Has he been surprised by the vehemence of the campaign? \"No, not at all. Frank and I are old political bruisers. But it's been different for Glenda... I've done a couple of things on the stage, and the thing is when people work on the stage they work together.\" Until recently, Glenda Jackson was a loyal Blairite. It is only since she realised Millbank was also waging war on her (at one point the media were deliberately misinformed that she was standing down) that she has become critical of the party machine. Livingstone says he thinks she has had the best campaign of the three of them. And it's certainly true that she has appeared both tougher and warmer since her eyes were opened to the mercenary side of politics. Now we remember what made her fiercely appealing as an actress. Livingstone has, somewhat presumptuously, offered Jackson the role of deputy. </p> <p> <b> Wimbledon, the Watershed, 8pm</b> </p> <p> A far cry from the salubrious wine and nibbles of the Royal Society. The club smells of sweat and stale beer. We're in the gents. I ask Livingstone what he's going to do for London's lavs. \"When I'm mayor we're going to have loads more toilets. I'm going to reopen all the ones in the tube stations.\" Tug, tug. Zip, zip. </p> <p>The audience are in hysterics. Livingstone is a terrific stand-up comic. One hand in his pocket, a smidge of sweat on the upper lip, one shabby brown shoe ahead of the other, he delivers giggles on demand. </p> <p>\"Jeffrey Archer, before his triumphant withdrawal from the race, was actually going round London saying, if you vote for me I'll introduce a \u00a3200 flat fine for everybody caught in the bus lane and three points on your licence. The Liberal Simon Hughes came up with the idea we'll impound your car for six months - bad news if it's not your car or you've lent it to your kids. I've learned from the success of Jack Straw... you can't outflank me on the law and order front, so I will introduce sharia law in the bus lane. Drive in the bus lane and we cut off your arms. I'm stumped about what to do for a third offence, but we'll come up with something.\" </p> <p>A man with a white beard and intense eyes says when he read that Livingstone had suggested he would like to chuck the World Trade Organisation in vast stocks if it visited London, he almost withdrew his support. \"Can you undertake not to make jokes and to keep your answers to matters about London?\" he asks. </p> <p>\"I think it would be sad if the mayor couldn't make a joke... I've got a very good one about Salman Rushdie and Yasser Arafat.\" </p> <p>\"Do you remember Adlai Stevenson [the Democrat candidate who stood against John F Kennedy in 1960]?\" asks the man with the intense eyes. </p> <p>\"Did you say Adlai Stevenson? Now he's sadly lost, but by God, he was a decent man wasn't he?\" </p> <p>\"Yes, but he lost. Because he made jokes.\" </p> <p>To be fair, the World Trade Organisation was a one-off. His jokes usually illustrate a political point. A couple of minutes later he cracks one about the time when the Tories were tempting council house buyers with any number of perks - the best scheme was buy two council houses, get one free. The man with the intense eyes is doubled in laughter. </p> <p>Another question: \"You're honest, you're inclusive, you follow most policies, so why isn't Tony Blair your friend?\" It's a common thread from Livingstone supporters desperate for him to win but equally anxious to know there will not be a fallout that could cost Labour a second term. </p> <p>Livingstone responds as he has done for years: when he and Blair meet in private they get on fine. He says he thinks Blair has been advised badly, that he should have never treated him like the Tory opposition. Yes, says the questioner, but how can we be sure you will be prepared to meet Blair half way - that you can work together? </p> <p>Livingstone is not prepared to joke about this. One criticism that seems to be sticking from the Millbank campaign is that he is not a team player. The strange thing is that he has always prided himself on his pragmatism, his ability to compromise, to make deals, to please and displease people on both sides. He asks how he could have possibly held the Greater London Council together for five years with a majority of four if he couldn't work with people. </p> <p>\"Everybody has fond memories of the GLC as some great shining apex of socialism. All I remember is being denounced by leftwingers for not being leftwing enough. And I just know that this is going to happen. They'll be denouncing me within six months because you have to build a compromise and consensus. I have this sneaking thought that in about 18 months' time Tony Blair will be sitting round the fire at Number 10 with a nice brandy saying, why did we get into a tizzy over all that? He's not been at all unreasonable.\" </p> <p>Livingstone says that while the Labour spin doctors recount the GLC's reign of terror, the people of London remember it differently. \"The idea that they can tell people that their memory is wrong is bizarre. The reason I'm ahead in the polls is not my rugged good looks but because, on balance, people think I deserve another go. What people remember is that in the awful, long, dark night of Thatcher tyranny we were a little lamp shining in the gloom.\" The government, he says, seems to have forgotten that Livingstone had a reason for being oppositional in the GLC days - he was in opposition. The crowd applaud and tell him they remember a city that had an identity, a city in which it became possible to travel cheaply and efficiently. </p> <p>What if he loses? He says both Jackson and Dobson would make fine mayors. While all around him have mewled and bawled, Livingstone has been positively presidential in this campaign. Occasionally, he allows his resentment to get the better of him. \"If I lose I'm going to go out and work even harder for Glenda or Frank than if I was the candidate, just so I can tell those who doubted my loyalty to go and stick it.\" </p> <p>John Madziva, a young Labourite, tells me why he is going to vote for Livingstone. Or rather, why he is not voting for Dobson. \"The party has become dictatorial. Patronising. It refuses to be open to debate. Look at how we lost our majority in Wales by imposing an unpopular candidate.\" </p> <p>Simon Gent has been sitting by my side throughout the meeting. Will he be voting for Livingstone? \"Yes. I did think Dobson was a credible candidate at first.\" As we talk he begins to sweat. He seems uneasy. \"It's been such a negative campaign.\" He pauses, embarrassed. \"Actually, I was campaigning for Frank until recently, but I couldn't stand it. There's been so much double-talk, hypocrisy.\" He sounds like a member of Dobsons Anonymous. \"Yes,\" he says parodying himself. \"I did it once and never again. I've been off the Dobson for a month now.\" </p> <p>What does he like about Livingstone? \"I talked to him a bit ago, and he impressed me. I come from Mitcham, and he said as a kid he went down there to see his cousin and they went newt hunting. It gave me a warm feeling. I suppose it's just a gut thing.\" </p> <p> <b> The car to Newsnight, 9.30pm</b> </p> <p> Half an hour to get to the BBC. With Livingstone's proposed 20mph speed limit in built-up areas we'd be struggling. He's on the phone telling a friend the meeting went well. What pleases him most is that the audience challenged him. \"They wanted reassurance I could work with Blair.\" </p> <p>What has hurt him most about the campaign? For once, there's not a hint of a smile. \"One former colleague who has been scathing in public assures me he doesn't believe a word of it. And there's one New Labour MP who has circulated the 'I'm backing Dobbo' letter, and he said to me he was so disgusted with what was being done he hoped I'd leave the party and take them on as an independent and defeat them to teach them a lesson. I said, but you circulated the Dobbo letter, and he said, 'Yeah, but I've got to look out for my future.'\" </p> <p>Livingstone's researcher Mark phones up a fellow campaigner who has been at the Brown-Blair meeting in town. He hears that when the cabinet colleagues attacked Livingstone they were drowned out by boos. Mark relays to Livingstone that Blair then changed his tack and said of course he would work with him if he had to. </p> <p>Livingstone is delighted, but he reins himself in. \"Why aren't you using your earpiece Mark? You're on the bloody phone so bloody much. You really must use the earpiece.\" </p> <p>Livingstone asks the BBC driver if he'll turn the radio on. All we can hear is the hissing of the audience from the Blair-Brown meeting as we head for the studios. </p> <p> Livingstone has only received the sketchiest outline of the meeting, but he talks about it with outrageous conviction. The Newsnight backdrop is a \"New Labour New Problems\" logo. Jeremy Paxman asks him what it's like to have the two most powerful people in the government meeting simply to rubbish you. \"Oh, this was much less rough than the other times,\" he says. \"It was positively friendly.\" </p> <p>Paxman's eyebrow lurches towards the heavens. \"What? They're close to endorsing you, are they? They say you're manifestly unfit to be mayor of London.\" Livingstone deadpans. </p> <p>The rest of the debate with three other Labourites is curiously muted. On the way out Mark and I say it was a bit dull. \"Well, that's because the three others can sense things are changing, that we're moving towards a deal.\" </p> <p>So he really thinks the Labour party are on the verge of endorsing him? \"Stop taking the tablets,\" he says. \"They're clouding your judgment.\" </p> <p> <b> Young Labour meeting, Westminster Council House, Saturday 3.10pm</b> </p> <p> Of the three candidates, only Jackson has arrived so far. The meeting was due to start at 3pm. Livingstone runs in, breathless, apologetic, tangled in his mobile phone. Bloody tubes. \"I'm just going to be ravaged by the youth.\" Twenty minutes later Dobson arrives. Over the past few months he has developed a knack of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. He explains why he is late: his taxi got caught up in a demo and then broke down and he had to change cabs. </p> <p>\"He's the only one who's not come on public transport,\" whispers a young Labourite. </p> <p>Young Labour should be Blair's second constituency - Dobson territory. I ask Melissa Mean, who has helped organise the meeting, whether she can find me a Dobson supporter to interview. \"Erm. Try asking Frank. On second thoughts, I'm not sure he'll be voting for himself.\" Councillor Murad Qureshi, an unfeasibly young 35-year-old, tells me that the Labour leader was asked to join the \"We support Dobbo\" picture of council leaders, but he refused. \"You know, this election has made me a bit cynical about politics,\" he says. </p> <p>There is little to divide the candidates on policy. Livingstone wants bus conductors back, Dobson doesn't. Both Dobson and Jackson support public-private partnership for tube expansion, while Livingstone is in favour of a bond scheme. That's about it. </p> <p>There is a difference in presentation, though. Dobson seems more old Labour than either Livingstone or Jackson. It's not simply the beard and body, it's his language - he often talks about socialism for one thing. Ironically, while Millbank has spun this as a contest between old Labour (Livingstone) and New Labour (Dobson), Livingstone has always thought of himself as a moderniser - he says he didn't only embrace Sinn Fein and anti-racist policies before the rest of them, he also embraced the tools of marketing. </p> <p>The reality is that this is a fight between No Questions Asked Labour and the independent minded - not simply on the podium, but in the constituencies as well. Melissa Mean says it's a significant election - for so long, people have been brainwashed into believing that the only way to keep power is to keep schtum if you disagree. Now things are changing. </p> <p> <b> The tube back home</b> </p> <p> It's freezing. \"When I'm mayor, I'm going to make sure the sun always shines, even at night,\" says Livingstone. We're accompanied by a photographer, and I wish he could have caught us the other day, when Livingstone was holding the Evening Standard aloft. Without being asked, he produces that day's Independent, with its \"Livingstone's massive lead\" headline, and smiles into the camera. </p> <p>We hear a cry from a group of boys going the opposite way. \"Ken Livingstone, move to the right please.\" As polite a heckle as you could wish for. </p> <p> He never did give me a decent answer on what he's learned over the past 20 years. Is that because he didn't think he had anything significant to learn? \"No. We tried too much change too quickly. In the first three months we launched everything. Before we got on to the more difficult and controversial areas, such as race and sexual orientation, we should have cut the fares first, so people could see we were doing something for everybody. My biggest failure was not to realise earlier that the centrally planned economy didn't work.\" </p> <p>I have never been on a tube with so much laughter, so many smiles. \"Is something amusing you?\" Livingstone asks a stranger as the photographer snaps away. The woman sitting next to him moves away when she notices the camera. \"You're not the lady who refused to smile at the prime minister, are you?\" he asks. </p> <p>The curious thing is that Livingstone is not a particularly warm person. When we meet he is quite impersonal; there is no small talk. But Livingstone is an incredibly warm politician. It almost feels like a form of hypocrisy, but it isn't. He is effortless with people - he genuinely doesn't seem to make an effort, doesn't seem to give two hoots whether we talk to him or like him; he doesn't play the politician. </p> <p>Perhaps this is the real reason Blair fears him. The prime minister has surrounded himself with competent and colourless politicians. He likes to feel he is the populist, the one who can chat to Joe Public, the one who can make people smile even though the script will have been revised a dozen times. But Livingstone is a genuine populist. As we sit in the laughing tube, I can't help thinking of that picture of Blair standing in a virtually empty carriage beseeching the young woman studiously ignoring him for one little common or garden smile. </p>",

You know, we got \u00a34,000 in small donations after they sent those letters out.\" Has he been surprised by the vehemence of the campaign? \"No, not at all. Frank and I are old political bruisers. But it's been different for Glenda... I've done a couple of things on the stage, and the thing is when people work on the stage they work together.\" Until recently, Glenda Jackson was a loyal Blairite. It is only since she realised Millbank was also waging war on her (at one point the media were deliberately misinformed that she was standing down) that she has become critical of the party machine. Livingstone says he thinks she has had the best campaign of the three of them. And it's certainly true that she has appeared both tougher and warmer since her eyes were opened to the mercenary side of politics. Now we remember what made her fiercely appealing as an actress. Livingstone has, somewhat presumptuously, offered Jackson the role of deputy. Wimbledon, the Watershed, 8pm A far cry from the salubrious wine and nibbles of the Royal Society. The club smells of sweat and stale beer. We're in the gents. I ask Livingstone what he's going to do for London's lavs. \"When I'm mayor we're going to have loads more toilets. I'm going to reopen all the ones in the tube stations.\" Tug, tug. Zip, zip. The audience are in hysterics. Livingstone is a terrific stand-up comic. One hand in his pocket, a smidge of sweat on the upper lip, one shabby brown shoe ahead of the other, he delivers giggles on demand. \"Jeffrey Archer, before his triumphant withdrawal from the race, was actually going round London saying, if you vote for me I'll introduce a \u00a3200 flat fine for everybody caught in the bus lane and three points on your licence. The Liberal Simon Hughes came up with the idea we'll impound your car for six months - bad news if it's not your car or you've lent it to your kids. I've learned from the success of Jack Straw... you can't outflank me on the law and order front, so I will introduce sharia law in the bus lane. Drive in the bus lane and we cut off your arms. I'm stumped about what to do for a third offence, but we'll come up with something.\" A man with a white beard and intense eyes says when he read that Livingstone had suggested he would like to chuck the World Trade Organisation in vast stocks if it visited London, he almost withdrew his support. \"Can you undertake not to make jokes and to keep your answers to matters about London?\" he asks. \"I think it would be sad if the mayor couldn't make a joke... I've got a very good one about Salman Rushdie and Yasser Arafat.\" \"Do you remember Adlai Stevenson [the Democrat candidate who stood against John F Kennedy in 1960]?\" asks the man with the intense eyes. \"Did you say Adlai Stevenson? Now he's sadly lost, but by God, he was a decent man wasn't he?\" \"Yes, but he lost. Because he made jokes.\" To be fair, the World Trade Organisation was a one-off. His jokes usually illustrate a political point. A couple of minutes later he cracks one about the time when the Tories were tempting council house buyers with any number of perks - the best scheme was buy two council houses, get one free. The man with the intense eyes is doubled in laughter. Another question: \"You're honest, you're inclusive, you follow most policies, so why isn't Tony Blair your friend?\" It's a common thread from Livingstone supporters desperate for him to win but equally anxious to know there will not be a fallout that could cost Labour a second term. Livingstone responds as he has done for years: when he and Blair meet in private they get on fine. He says he thinks Blair has been advised badly, that he should have never treated him like the Tory opposition. Yes, says the questioner, but how can we be sure you will be prepared to meet Blair half way - that you can work together? Livingstone is not prepared to joke about this. One criticism that seems to be sticking from the Millbank campaign is that he is not a team player. The strange thing is that he has always prided himself on his pragmatism, his ability to compromise, to make deals, to please and displease people on both sides. He asks how he could have possibly held the Greater London Council together for five years with a majority of four if he couldn't work with people. \"Everybody has fond memories of the GLC as some great shining apex of socialism. All I remember is being denounced by leftwingers for not being leftwing enough. And I just know that this is going to happen. They'll be denouncing me within six months because you have to build a compromise and consensus. I have this sneaking thought that in about 18 months' time Tony Blair will be sitting round the fire at Number 10 with a nice brandy saying, why did we get into a tizzy over all that? He's not been at all unreasonable.\" Livingstone says that while the Labour spin doctors recount the GLC's reign of terror, the people of London remember it differently. \"The idea that they can tell people that their memory is wrong is bizarre. The reason I'm ahead in the polls is not my rugged good looks but because, on balance, people think I deserve another go. What people remember is that in the awful, long, dark night of Thatcher tyranny we were a little lamp shining in the gloom.\" The government, he says, seems to have forgotten that Livingstone had a reason for being oppositional in the GLC days - he was in opposition. The crowd applaud and tell him they remember a city that had an identity, a city in which it became possible to travel cheaply and efficiently. What if he loses? He says both Jackson and Dobson would make fine mayors. While all around him have mewled and bawled, Livingstone has been positively presidential in this campaign. Occasionally, he allows his resentment to get the better of him. \"If I lose I'm going to go out and work even harder for Glenda or Frank than if I was the candidate, just so I can tell those who doubted my loyalty to go and stick it.\" John Madziva, a young Labourite, tells me why he is going to vote for Livingstone. Or rather, why he is not voting for Dobson. \"The party has become dictatorial. Patronising. It refuses to be open to debate. Look at how we lost our majority in Wales by imposing an unpopular candidate.\" Simon Gent has been sitting by my side throughout the meeting. Will he be voting for Livingstone? \"Yes. I did think Dobson was a credible candidate at first.\" As we talk he begins to sweat. He seems uneasy. \"It's been such a negative campaign.\" He pauses, embarrassed. \"Actually, I was campaigning for Frank until recently, but I couldn't stand it. There's been so much double-talk, hypocrisy.\" He sounds like a member of Dobsons Anonymous. \"Yes,\" he says parodying himself. \"I did it once and never again. I've been off the Dobson for a month now.\" What does he like about Livingstone? \"I talked to him a bit ago, and he impressed me. I come from Mitcham, and he said as a kid he went down there to see his cousin and they went newt hunting. It gave me a warm feeling. I suppose it's just a gut thing.\" The car to Newsnight, 9.30pm Half an hour to get to the BBC. With Livingstone's proposed 20mph speed limit in built-up areas we'd be struggling. He's on the phone telling a friend the meeting went well. What pleases him most is that the audience challenged him. \"They wanted reassurance I could work with Blair.\" What has hurt him most about the campaign? For once, there's not a hint of a smile. \"One former colleague who has been scathing in public assures me he doesn't believe a word of it. And there's one New Labour MP who has circulated the 'I'm backing Dobbo' letter, and he said to me he was so disgusted with what was being done he hoped I'd leave the party and take them on as an independent and defeat them to teach them a lesson. I said, but you circulated the Dobbo letter, and he said, 'Yeah, but I've got to look out for my future.'\" Livingstone's researcher Mark phones up a fellow campaigner who has been at the Brown-Blair meeting in town. He hears that when the cabinet colleagues attacked Livingstone they were drowned out by boos. Mark relays to Livingstone that Blair then changed his tack and said of course he would work with him if he had to. Livingstone is delighted, but he reins himself in. \"Why aren't you using your earpiece Mark? You're on the bloody phone so bloody much. You really must use the earpiece.\" Livingstone asks the BBC driver if he'll turn the radio on. All we can hear is the hissing of the audience from the Blair-Brown meeting as we head for the studios. Livingstone has only received the sketchiest outline of the meeting, but he talks about it with outrageous conviction. The Newsnight backdrop is a \"New Labour New Problems\" logo. Jeremy Paxman asks him what it's like to have the two most powerful people in the government meeting simply to rubbish you. \"Oh, this was much less rough than the other times,\" he says. \"It was positively friendly.\" Paxman's eyebrow lurches towards the heavens. \"What? They're close to endorsing you, are they? They say you're manifestly unfit to be mayor of London.\" Livingstone deadpans. The rest of the debate with three other Labourites is curiously muted. On the way out Mark and I say it was a bit dull. \"Well, that's because the three others can sense things are changing, that we're moving towards a deal.\" So he really thinks the Labour party are on the verge of endorsing him? \"Stop taking the tablets,\" he says. \"They're clouding your judgment.\" Young Labour meeting, Westminster Council House, Saturday 3.10pm Of the three candidates, only Jackson has arrived so far. The meeting was due to start at 3pm. Livingstone runs in, breathless, apologetic, tangled in his mobile phone. Bloody tubes. \"I'm just going to be ravaged by the youth.\" Twenty minutes later Dobson arrives. Over the past few months he has developed a knack of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. He explains why he is late: his taxi got caught up in a demo and then broke down and he had to change cabs. \"He's the only one who's not come on public transport,\" whispers a young Labourite. Young Labour should be Blair's second constituency - Dobson territory. I ask Melissa Mean, who has helped organise the meeting, whether she can find me a Dobson supporter to interview. \"Erm. Try asking Frank. On second thoughts, I'm not sure he'll be voting for himself.\" Councillor Murad Qureshi, an unfeasibly young 35-year-old, tells me that the Labour leader was asked to join the \"We support Dobbo\" picture of council leaders, but he refused. \"You know, this election has made me a bit cynical about politics,\" he says. There is little to divide the candidates on policy. Livingstone wants bus conductors back, Dobson doesn't. Both Dobson and Jackson support public-private partnership for tube expansion, while Livingstone is in favour of a bond scheme. That's about it. There is a difference in presentation, though. Dobson seems more old Labour than either Livingstone or Jackson. It's not simply the beard and body, it's his language - he often talks about socialism for one thing. Ironically, while Millbank has spun this as a contest between old Labour (Livingstone) and New Labour (Dobson), Livingstone has always thought of himself as a moderniser - he says he didn't only embrace Sinn Fein and anti-racist policies before the rest of them, he also embraced the tools of marketing. The reality is that this is a fight between No Questions Asked Labour and the independent minded - not simply on the podium, but in the constituencies as well. Melissa Mean says it's a significant election - for so long, people have been brainwashed into believing that the only way to keep power is to keep schtum if you disagree. Now things are changing. The tube back home It's freezing. \"When I'm mayor, I'm going to make sure the sun always shines, even at night,\" says Livingstone. We're accompanied by a photographer, and I wish he could have caught us the other day, when Livingstone was holding the Evening Standard aloft. Without being asked, he produces that day's Independent, with its \"Livingstone's massive lead\" headline, and smiles into the camera. We hear a cry from a group of boys going the opposite way. \"Ken Livingstone, move to the right please.\" As polite a heckle as you could wish for. He never did give me a decent answer on what he's learned over the past 20 years. Is that because he didn't think he had anything significant to learn? \"No. We tried too much change too quickly. In the first three months we launched everything. Before we got on to the more difficult and controversial areas, such as race and sexual orientation, we should have cut the fares first, so people could see we were doing something for everybody. My biggest failure was not to realise earlier that the centrally planned economy didn't work.\" I have never been on a tube with so much laughter, so many smiles. \"Is something amusing you?\" Livingstone asks a stranger as the photographer snaps away. The woman sitting next to him moves away when she notices the camera. \"You're not the lady who refused to smile at the prime minister, are you?\" he asks. The curious thing is that Livingstone is not a particularly warm person. When we meet he is quite impersonal; there is no small talk. But Livingstone is an incredibly warm politician. It almost feels like a form of hypocrisy, but it isn't. He is effortless with people - he genuinely doesn't seem to make an effort, doesn't seem to give two hoots whether we talk to him or like him; he doesn't play the politician. Perhaps this is the real reason Blair fears him. The prime minister has surrounded himself with competent and colourless politicians. He likes to feel he is the populist, the one who can chat to Joe Public, the one who can make people smile even though the script will have been revised a dozen times. But Livingstone is a genuine populist. As we sit in the laughing tube, I can't help thinking of that picture of Blair standing in a virtually empty carriage beseeching the young woman studiously ignoring him for one little common or garden smile.",

      "body": "<p>Peter Brook's influence on modern theatre is so pervasive that, when he says a production influenced him, you can't help but take notice. The renowned director - whose 1970 Midsummer Night's Dream is considered a milestone in theatre history, and whose book The Empty Space is a bible for many young directors - was certainly affected by the 1973 production of The Island. South African writer Athol Fugard's play describes life on Robben Island, Nelson Mandela's long-time prison. Brook's rapt account of its opening moments is practically a work of theatre itself. </p> <p>\"Not a word spoken, nothing on the stage, for 40 minutes - just two men with imaginary wheelbarrows, in an imaginary space.\" The two men were Winston Ntshona and John Kani, co-creators of the piece with Fugard. \"Gradually,\" Brook continues, cobalt blue eyes gleaming, \"the audience went through a whole cycle. First amazement, then the beginnings of irritation - 'We're an audience, we've come for something, what's going on here?' - then impatience. And then suddenly the whole audience was transformed by a deep feeling of shame for having dared to think to themselves, 'Come on, get on with it.' Because we were not only witnessing actors showing something about people who at that moment were living that life on Robben Island; they were living it themselves.\" </p> <p>We're in the front room of Brook's London flat. He's speaking in a holy whisper and the ever-so-delicate return of teacup to saucer seems suddenly cacophonous. \"When one saw the reality of their sweat,\" he goes on, \"the reality of the weight of the imaginary objects they were lifting, the audience dropped any expectation of the play 'starting'. They realised this was the play, and waited, with respect and absolute involvement, for whatever was coming next.\" </p> <p>What came next Brook has never forgotten, which partly explains why this fiercely independent director has lent his expertise to - and is \"proud to be associated with\" - a revival of that same production. Last year he invited Ntshona and Kani, now in their fifties, to perform the play at his Parisian space, the Bouffes du Nord. Now he has coaxed that Market Theatre of Johannesburg production back to life for its final run, opening this week at the National Theatre in London. He remains excited by it. \"What is extraordinary to this day,\" he enthuses, in his meticulous, thoughtful way, \"is that you can see that the performers are not playing for themselves. They really are the spokesmen for their nation, and that is the ancient idea of what any artist and any poet is.\" In 1995 the duo performed The Island for President Mandela. </p> <p>The circumstances in which Kani and Ntshona return are a far cry from 1973. Back then, the illegal production fled South Africa and Kani - now the artistic director of the Market Theatre - had to present himself as Fugard's gardener to gain entry to the UK. In theatre terms, too, that world was a world apart. In those days, says Brook, \"all experimental groups - including my own - were struggling to free theatre of the old complexes by which all that mattered was the text. I know it's almost unimaginable today, but the body\" - he pronounces the word with infinite care - \"was ignored. </p> <p>\"Then suddenly into the Royal Court came two actors who had reached the end of this process, not through artistic study, but through suffering and social conditions. For them, communicating an experience could only happen through the total involvement of the body.\" Brook attributes this to the repressive South African Pass Act, which \"by dividing up the people into townships that were controlled and circled by the police, made instant and vivid communication very necessary and important\" - because it could be violently interrupted at any moment. </p> <p>The London audience was stunned by this physical expressiveness. \"Here was what, in a way, mime was meant to be: the silent speech of the body - taken to such a point that the audience was forced to recognise that this was stronger than a documentary film.\" Brook is famously uncomfortable with \"political theatre\", but South African politics were a humanitarian issue. The Island was at the same time political and essentially human - its \"other miracle\", says Brook. \"Political theatre, when it was about serious themes, tended for that reason to be dramatic. Here you found that people who were right at the source, who had lived this and whose families had lived this, could portray the situation with humour. </p> <p>\"These two men had a powerful way of living without meanness. Anger was there, but it wasn't a mean anger; bitterness was there, but it wasn't a bitterness that took away from the joy of living. The play did an enormous service for South Africa, which was to make the suffering South African not an object of white liberal compassion, but a rich human being to be respected and admired.\" </p> <p> Of course, white liberal compassion has long since moved on from South Africa, and so I ask of this revival the question Brook himself demands in The Empty Space we ask of theatre: what for? Brook described in the book how, in his own anti-Vietnam production US, \"the liveliness of the actors waned as the immediacy of the relation to their theme lessened\". Today, he admits that Ntshona's and Kani's - and the audience's - relation to imprisonment and apartheid has changed: hence the revival. </p> <p>Since its debut The Island has taken on an internationalist resonance - one Paris performance reportedly left two Kosovan refugees in the audience distraught. On a more practical level, its exhausting opening sequence \"is even more moving\", says Brook, \"with older men committing themselves to the effort. But while it's tragic to see young people's lives ruined by being imprisoned for life, it's as tragic in a different way to see elderly men humiliated and forced to work in this way. So something has been transformed; something has been gained and has matured.\" </p> <p>Perhaps Brook intuits a personal parallel between the characters' Sisyphean toil and his own quest, continuing into his 76th year, for the theatrical holy grail. Certainly, it's easy to see why The Island caught his imagination. It deals with theatre: its characters prepare to perform Antigone at a prison concert. Fugard, Ntshona and Kani devised the play-within-a-play motif after a colleague, due to perform in a production of Sophocles's play, was arrested and imprisoned on Robben Island. The effect is that \"this realistic play takes on a mythical stature, it becomes an epic play\" - classic Brook territory. \"Suddenly you identify the actor with the woman he is playing, who is prepared to die rather than yield one bit of her conviction.\" It's a startling parallel, by which Brook, whose life has been dedicated to exploring theatre as a self-expressive ritual, remains forcibly struck. </p> <p>But if one aspect of this remarkable production reflects Brook's passions, it's the heroism behind its creation. It accords with his belief that \"you have to be prepared to fight for what you want. </p> <p>\"You have to sense what the pressures are and choose,\" he adds. \"Either you go along with those pressures or you find all the possible ways of making a space for yourself.\" Making a space for himself - in Paris - and finding empty spaces to call theatres are the dominant, intertwining threads of Brook's career. </p> <p>While that career, and productions such as The Island, have helped liberate theatre, that crucial choice must still be faced. \"Nowadays,\" says Brook, \"there are new sorts of pressures. Today, the cost of making theatre is so enormous it's become a new form of institutionalising. Right now, the most important thing to recognise is that money has to be spent on the right to fail. </p> <p>\"When John, Winston and Athol were working they had the freedom that it cost nothing at all, so they could take all the risks that they wanted to take; but a system existed - apartheid - that made it almost impossible.\" They struggled and won, securing a lifetime's respect from Brook. \"That need, to break out of whatever is the established system and take risks, is always there,\" he insists now, in a clarion call to his, and Kani's, and Ntshona's, and Fugard's inheritors. \"But there will always be new ways to hold it back.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Island is in rep at the National Theatre, London SE1 (0171-452 3000), till February 26.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Tonight, if you live within striking distance of London's West End, you can take your pick from Yasmin Reza's hit comedy Art, which lasts about 80 minutes, Athol Fugard's The Island, which lasts around 85, or Conor McPherson's Dublin Carol, which comes in at a bulky hour and a half. </p> <p>If these sound daunting, less demanding alternatives are available. Gradiva at the Purcell Room lasts about 45 minutes, and Krapp's Last Tape at the New Ambassadors slightly less. </p> <p>But those with busy schedules will be heading for the Isle of Dogs, where the experimental theatre company Stan's Caf\u00e9 is performing a new show, It's Your Film. It lasts just 180 seconds. </p> <p>This is by no means a record. Samuel Beckett, a playwright who always found brevity a virtue, wrote a play called Breath that lasts just 30 seconds. And The End Part 2, which was performed at one minute past midnight at the Arches in Glasgow to usher in the year 2000, took around seven minutes to chart the entire human life cycle. Talk about your life flashing in front of you. </p> <p>There was a time, not so long ago, when a night at the theatre was rather a hefty undertaking. I remember when it was common to see those who lived out of town creeping out of West End plays before the end of the performance in order to guarantee their transport home. Not any more. Walk down Shaftesbury Avenue or St Martin's Lane after 10.15pm and most of the theatres are already locked up for the night. </p> <p>There is a theory among the more cynical that however long any theatre show is, it is always 10 minutes too long, but certainly the past few years have seen a trend towards brevity. Who wants to sit through four hours of Hamlet when you can see all 37 plays in 97 minutes with the Reduced Shakespeare Company? And have a meal and go to a club. </p> <p>\"Theatre is like a Tardis - it gets shorter or longer depending on how much you are enjoying yourself,\" says Mike Bradwell of the Bush Theatre, although he agrees that audiences' attention spans are getting shorter. Bradwell points out that playwrights are also increasingly drawn to the idea of short, sharp shocks: he has new plays by Enda Welsh and Hilary Fannin coming up, neither of which last more than an hour and a quarter. </p> <p>Helen Lannaghan of the London International Mime Festival, which specialises in oddities such as It's Your Film, says audiences and theatre managers out of London are more likely to be unhappy if the experience is over too quickly. </p> <p>\"In rural areas people can travel a long way to the theatre, and some do find it upsetting if they spend two or three times as long getting there and back as they do in the theatre,\" she says. From the theatre manager's point of view, short performances mean loss of revenue from interval bar sales. </p> <p>Lannaghan makes sure that the length of shows is clearly stated in advance publicity and, on occasion, offers a lower seat price for shows that come in under 45 minutes. \"At the same time, we are acutely aware that people are not buying time - they are buying an experience. It is not the same thing as buying wallpaper,\" she says. </p> <p>The festival circuit, which tends to offer short slots, has contributed greatly to the rise of the short play and performance. Just five years ago the average length of an Edinburgh Festival show was just under 90 minutes. Now it's less than an hour. This has less to do with artistic drive than with market forces. Venue managers can make more profit if they squeeze in more shows. Once again, there appear to be no complaints on the part of audiences. </p> <p>\"Lots of people come to get as much of the festival experience as possible. It is an event for them. They want to be able to take in four shows in an afternoon,\" says a spokesman for the Edinburgh Fringe. </p> <p>The use of the word \"event\" is pertinent. Seeing Forced Entertainment's 24-hour epic Who Can Sing Me a Song to Unfrighten Me is an event. So is the Maly Theatre's staging of eight hours of Dostoevsky. But then so is the 180-second It's Your Film. In a world where everything must be an event, people are loath to risk two and half hours on an unknown quantity unless it has the kind of starry casting that turns it into event theatre. </p> <p>Tom Morris, artistic director at BAC, isn't entirely sorry. \"In the past during long performances people would have wandered in and out and talked to each other. It is only in the past couple of centuries that people have been expected to sit in silence for long periods. People won't put up with that awful, prolonged, unnatural silence - and they're probably right. It should be reserved for funerals, not theatre.\"</p> <p>\u0095 It's Your Film is at Cabot Hall, Canary Wharf, London E14, till Saturday as part of the London International Mime Festival.

Talk about your life flashing in front of you. There was a time, not so long ago, when a night at the theatre was rather a hefty undertaking. I remember when it was common to see those who lived out of town creeping out of West End plays before the end of the performance in order to guarantee their transport home. Not any more. Walk down Shaftesbury Avenue or St Martin's Lane after 10.15pm and most of the theatres are already locked up for the night. There is a theory among the more cynical that however long any theatre show is, it is always 10 minutes too long, but certainly the past few years have seen a trend towards brevity. Who wants to sit through four hours of Hamlet when you can see all 37 plays in 97 minutes with the Reduced Shakespeare Company? And have a meal and go to a club. \"Theatre is like a Tardis - it gets shorter or longer depending on how much you are enjoying yourself,\" says Mike Bradwell of the Bush Theatre, although he agrees that audiences' attention spans are getting shorter. Bradwell points out that playwrights are also increasingly drawn to the idea of short, sharp shocks: he has new plays by Enda Welsh and Hilary Fannin coming up, neither of which last more than an hour and a quarter. Helen Lannaghan of the London International Mime Festival, which specialises in oddities such as It's Your Film, says audiences and theatre managers out of London are more likely to be unhappy if the experience is over too quickly. \"In rural areas people can travel a long way to the theatre, and some do find it upsetting if they spend two or three times as long getting there and back as they do in the theatre,\" she says. From the theatre manager's point of view, short performances mean loss of revenue from interval bar sales. Lannaghan makes sure that the length of shows is clearly stated in advance publicity and, on occasion, offers a lower seat price for shows that come in under 45 minutes. \"At the same time, we are acutely aware that people are not buying time - they are buying an experience. It is not the same thing as buying wallpaper,\" she says. The festival circuit, which tends to offer short slots, has contributed greatly to the rise of the short play and performance. Just five years ago the average length of an Edinburgh Festival show was just under 90 minutes. Now it's less than an hour. This has less to do with artistic drive than with market forces. Venue managers can make more profit if they squeeze in more shows. Once again, there appear to be no complaints on the part of audiences. \"Lots of people come to get as much of the festival experience as possible. It is an event for them. They want to be able to take in four shows in an afternoon,\" says a spokesman for the Edinburgh Fringe. The use of the word \"event\" is pertinent. Seeing Forced Entertainment's 24-hour epic Who Can Sing Me a Song to Unfrighten Me is an event. So is the Maly Theatre's staging of eight hours of Dostoevsky. But then so is the 180-second It's Your Film. In a world where everything must be an event, people are loath to risk two and half hours on an unknown quantity unless it has the kind of starry casting that turns it into event theatre. Tom Morris, artistic director at BAC, isn't entirely sorry. \"In the past during long performances people would have wandered in and out and talked to each other. It is only in the past couple of centuries that people have been expected to sit in silence for long periods. People won't put up with that awful, prolonged, unnatural silence - and they're probably right. It should be reserved for funerals, not theatre.\" \u0095 It's Your Film is at Cabot Hall, Canary Wharf, London E14, till Saturday as part of the London International Mime Festival.

      "bodyText": "A battle is raging across Whitehall over whether human rights and environmental considerations should play any part in deciding whether the government should underwrite billions of pounds worth of exports worldwide. Confidential documents - leaked to the Guardian and Channel 4 - reveal that an internal review ordered by the trade secretary, Stephen Byers, has revealed an establishment riven by pressures from civil servants, who want the government to abandon ethical criteria in favour of commercial considerations. The documents show the difficulties confronting some Labour cabinet ministers who are trying to retain an ethical dimension to export policy while multinationals and British firms demand that they back large arms, power and oil and gas projects. Multinationals are reportedly saying they may move production out of Britain and will apply for export aid from countries such as Italy, the US and Belgium, which have less rigorous criteria. Last year, amid concern about the role of the shadowy export credit guarantee department - part of the department of trade and industry - Mr Byers launched a fundamental review over its future, particularly over whether it should help the poorest developing countries emerge from debt. The inquiry will report in March. The government has underwritten \u00a317bn worth of contracts over the past five years to countries including China, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia and Zimbabwe. The leaked documents indicate that Whitehall favours relaxing blanket bans on regimes such as Argentina, Nigeria and Venezuela, and replacing this with cover provided to exporters on a \"case by case\" basis. The disclosures follow rows over arms sales to Pakistan, Indonesia and Zimbabwe after cabinet office minutes were leaked to the Guardian. Four departments are at the centre of the Whitehall battle, revealed in documents to be shown on tomorrow night's Mark Thomas Product. The ministry of defence and the DTI are on one side, calling for few restrictions, and the department of environment, transport and the regions and Clare Short's department of international development are on the other. The foreign office appears to be far more guarded in its support of an ethical policy. In two submissions to the inquiry, Malcolm Rickson, a senior MoD civil servant with the defence exports sales organisation, states that a unilateral ethical foreign policy puts Britain in \"a lose-lose situation\". \"There is nothing to be gained by, for example, imposing environmental or human rights criteria on the acceptability of business for ECGD cover unless these criteria are internationally agreed and applied in practice. Unilateral action over such criteria merely allows others to win the business without taking any account of environmental, human rights or other wider factors.\" He adds that on defence sales, in particular, a decision to refuse a country export credits can \"have very long term consequences on the UK's prospects for winning business\". \"Decisions taken today, driven by a particular situation, can have an effect long after the situation in the country has changed many of our customers have long memories.

The strongest case for more ethical considerations is made by Ms Short. In a two-page letter to the review panel, she demands that the ECGD consider whether developing countries' economic policies include sustainable development aimed at relieving poverty. She calls for damage to the environment to be a key consideration in helping countries and calls on the ECGD to take a lead in encouraging private business to invest in countries that follow such a policy, citing Uganda, which has received debt relief, as a good example. She is backed by Penny Brooke, a senior civil servant in the department of the environment, transport and the regions, who says: \"Our needs must not be met by treating others, including future generations and people elsewhere in the world, unfairly.\" The foreign office itself is more lukewarm saying the \"core criteria should be financial\" in supporting British firms but \"there is scope at the margins for introducing other considerations\".",

A group of powerful companies led by Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, originally filed their lawsuit in 1996, alleging that the two credit card companies had violated anti-trust laws through their anti-competitive behaviour. The US Justice Department followed this private lawsuit with its own legal action launched more than a year ago. In recent weeks, Judge John Gleeson has handed the retailer a preliminary victory by allowing the US Justice Department to review evidence with Wal-Mart's lawyers. Retail groups including Sears Roebuck, Safeway and Circuit City have accused Visa and Mastercard of abusing their dominance of the credit card industry by forcing them to pay high prices for debit cards. In a case with echoes of the landmark case against Microsoft, the credit card companies are accused of forcing stores to take both their debit and credit cards. The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in Brooklyn, is aimed at preventing the two card companies from bullying their way into new markets. The charges could be particularly challenging for Visa and Mastercard as they seek to take advantage of the growth in online shopping and greater need for electronic payments. Visa, which is owned by 21,000 banks, is the world's largest consumer payment system with around 800m cards in circulation. MasterCard, the world's second largest, is owned by more than 23,000 financial institutions. Together they control more than 75% of the world's credit card market.

      "trailText": "<p><strong> Karen Morris, 36</strong> Housing manager </p>",
      "byline": "Interviews by Cayte Williams",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Karen Morris, 36</strong> Housing manager </p> <p> I did a work placement at a bank as part of a local business initiative. At the end I had to give a speech on the financial side of our company to these City types. It was important to get all the jargon right, and to do thorough research. I didn't want to come across as fluffy. Also, you have to know what your audience wants. Mine only wanted the financial facts, not the social implications of my work. Humour is good: I asked questions at the end, finishing with \"Who's your favourite Spice Girl?\" and offered them a bowl of mints. They all went mad for the sweets. </p> <p> <strong> Louise Price, 53</strong> Company director </p> <p> Public speaking stages are set up for men. As a woman, the microphone will always be too high, the sound check is set for a man's voice so women usually sound squeaky, and I never have anywhere to put my handbag. I've learnt to take my time. I put my handbag over the back of my chair, adjust the microphone to my height and speak slowly and in a deeper voice than usual. The important thing is to appear self-possessed and confident. People only listen to 20% of what you're saying; the other 80% is concentrating on your body language, the way you're standing and what you're wearing - particularly if you're female. </p> <p> <strong> Michael Leith, 47</strong> Financial director </p> <p> I've always dreaded public speaking. In particular, it was the way I never seemed to get the timing right that really bothered me. In the end I went on a course, where I learnt to divide my speech into three parts. If I'm doing a 15-minute speech I work out beforehand where I should be after five and then after 10 minutes, and keep my watch on the table in front of me. It slows me down and also makes me think anew about what I'm saying. Also, I've now realised that you have to take a gentle breath rather than a deep breath at the start of your speech. It makes you speak more slowly and clearly, rather than just trying to get the whole thing out in one go. </p> <p> A few years ago I gave a speech to 400 people about the charity organisation I work for. I prepared little prompt cards because I'd read that's what you do. I began and promptly lost the order of my cards, so I put them back on the table and simply talked. It sounds dangerous, but I just took off and spoke with passion. Afterwards, an MP in the audience told me I was really good. Since then I never use prompt cards, but always take them with me as a security blanket. Ad-libbing gives your speech conviction: there's nothing worse than a monosyllabic tone. </p> <p> <strong> Daniel Williams, 31</strong> Financial manager </p> <p> My parents were in the Salvation Army, and the congregation were always asking us children to sing on stage. It has helped with public speaking, because I don't get fazed when I'm the focus of attention. Before my first speech I spent three nights worrying about what I was going to say, rather than how I would behave. On the day I felt relatively comfortable. I'm a self-help fanatic and I've got one of those books which teach you how to relax. I didn't look at anyone directly - I fixed on a couple of points in the room. That way you don't look so wooden when you speak. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Karen Morris, 36 Housing manager I did a work placement at a bank as part of a local business initiative. At the end I had to give a speech on the financial side of our company to these City types. It was important to get all the jargon right, and to do thorough research. I didn't want to come across as fluffy. Also, you have to know what your audience wants. Mine only wanted the financial facts, not the social implications of my work. Humour is good: I asked questions at the end, finishing with \"Who's your favourite Spice Girl?\" and offered them a bowl of mints. They all went mad for the sweets. Louise Price, 53 Company director Public speaking stages are set up for men. As a woman, the microphone will always be too high, the sound check is set for a man's voice so women usually sound squeaky, and I never have anywhere to put my handbag. I've learnt to take my time. I put my handbag over the back of my chair, adjust the microphone to my height and speak slowly and in a deeper voice than usual. The important thing is to appear self-possessed and confident. People only listen to 20% of what you're saying; the other 80% is concentrating on your body language, the way you're standing and what you're wearing - particularly if you're female. Michael Leith, 47 Financial director I've always dreaded public speaking. In particular, it was the way I never seemed to get the timing right that really bothered me. In the end I went on a course, where I learnt to divide my speech into three parts. If I'm doing a 15-minute speech I work out beforehand where I should be after five and then after 10 minutes, and keep my watch on the table in front of me. It slows me down and also makes me think anew about what I'm saying. Also, I've now realised that you have to take a gentle breath rather than a deep breath at the start of your speech. It makes you speak more slowly and clearly, rather than just trying to get the whole thing out in one go. A few years ago I gave a speech to 400 people about the charity organisation I work for. I prepared little prompt cards because I'd read that's what you do. I began and promptly lost the order of my cards, so I put them back on the table and simply talked. It sounds dangerous, but I just took off and spoke with passion. Afterwards, an MP in the audience told me I was really good. Since then I never use prompt cards, but always take them with me as a security blanket. Ad-libbing gives your speech conviction: there's nothing worse than a monosyllabic tone. Daniel Williams, 31 Financial manager My parents were in the Salvation Army, and the congregation were always asking us children to sing on stage. It has helped with public speaking, because I don't get fazed when I'm the focus of attention. Before my first speech I spent three nights worrying about what I was going to say, rather than how I would behave. On the day I felt relatively comfortable. I'm a self-help fanatic and I've got one of those books which teach you how to relax. I didn't look at anyone directly - I fixed on a couple of points in the room. That way you don't look so wooden when you speak.",

The British suit is about to be left on the shelf. </p> <p>Some bars in the City ban customers from wearing suits, while they are already pass\u00e9 among successful businessmen such as Bill Gates and Gerald Levin, the chairman of Time Warner. And on Monday the business consultancy firm Arthur Andersen made them optional when it informed its 7,000 staff by email that a more relaxed dress code was being introduced with immediate effect. </p> <p>Paul Clarke, spokesman for Arthur Andersen, said the new dress code was already in evidence, with around half the staff now wearing \"business casual\" clothes. </p> <p>\"I can see from just looking around the office that people are wearing more casual clothes. There are people without ties and in casual shirts or funnel-neck jumpers.\" </p> <p>Clarke explained that the move fitted in with many of Arthur Andersen's clients, especially e-commerce and internet companies, which tend to have more relaxed working practices. The new code was part of the global relaunch of the company and was about giving staff a choice. \"If someone gets up in the morning and knows they do not have any appointments with clients, they can look more casual.\" </p> <p>The move was greeted with relief by the firm's staff. \"We're all very excited,\" said Clarke. \"I'm not going to stop wearing suits completely, but I will no longer have to dress up if I'm not meeting a client.\" </p> <p>Elsewhere there were mixed reactions. The head of campaigning in the Industrial Society, Debra Allcock, believes the suit reinforces outdated notions of what the business world is - or should be - about. \"When everyone is wearing suits they are reinforcing the stereotype that the culture in an office is white, male, middle-aged and affluent,\" she says. \"By expanding the dress code you open up the possibility for people to reflect their diversity.\" </p> <p>But the managing director of one Savile Row tailor believes allowing people to wear casual clothes could send off the wrong signals to prospective clients. \"A lot of people feel more comfortable in a suit and with people in suits,\" said Hugh Holland of Kilgour, French and Stanbury. \"The trouble with casual clothes is that there aren't any boundaries to indicate what is and what is not appropriate. One person might understand it to mean khaki trousers and a sports jacket. Another might think it means a Mickey Mouse jumper.\" </p> <p>This is a particular problem with British men, says Holland, who are among the worst dressers in Europe. \"Italian men take the same amount of care over what they wear as British women,\" he says. </p> <p>The answer, says Clarke, is trust. \"We're saying that the company has confidence in its employees to decide for themselves how to look. But people can carry on wearing suits all the time if they prefer to. It's a question of flexibility.\" </p> <p>It's also a question of inevitability. Thanks to the European Union, by October not wearing a suit could effectively be a human right. \"This is a great piece of marketing on Andersen's part,\" says Allcock. \"They are giving this impression of being up-front and forward-thinking, but they are doing something they will have to do in the end anyway.\" </p> <p>Under the European legislation, which will be enshrined in British law in October, staff may be able to argue that their boss's insistence on a company dress code is a violation of their freedom of expression and right to privacy. But even without the law, the trend towards casual wear at work was already taking hold. </p> <p>\"The whole thing is changing,\" says Chris Scott-Gray, the director of the Menswear Council, which oversees Britain's suit market, worth \u00a3590m a year. \"Dress-down Fridays, for instance, have become dress-down weeks. More and more companies are adopting dress-down policies - but they are still prescriptive about what can and can't be worn. It is certainly not being driven by European policy - it is being driven by people's desire to be more comfort able at work and to present themselves in the way they see best.\" </p> <p>The absence of guidelines is a problem, admits Allcock. \"I think it is up to the employer to say what is appropriate professional wear and to set a few parameters. But the idea that without guidelines people are going to turn up in bikinis is absurd.\" </p> <p>The trend towards casual office wear, which started in the US and is yet to reach most of continental Europe, cements rather than dispels inconsistencies about what we can wear in the workplace. Earlier this month, jobseekers were told they had to wear a suit to interviews or risk having their benefits cut. </p> <p>\"First impressions count, and the standard dress for interviews is a suit for men and something equally smart for women,\" a spokesperson at the employment department said. \"We will make funds available for people who have no smart clothes, although it might be possible to get them on loan.\" </p> <p>Last week Judy Owen, a former training manager with the Professional Golf Association, won an industrial tribunal after they banned her from wearing trousers. Her victory came only two months after Eurostar caved in to legal pressure and announced that female security guards could choose to wear skirts or trousers when screening passengers and performing other duties; Debbie Sheen, 37, and Lynn McKay, 35, had been sent home the previous month from the Waterloo terminal in London for refusing to wear skirts. </p> <p>But the end of suits does not necessarily mean the end of uniforms. As one Andersen employee said yesterday: \"I'll probably end up wearing the same old stuff, but just without a jacket.\" When formal dress codes are relaxed, informal ones simply take their place. \"What often happens is that people will just turn up in another uniform,\" says Allcock. \"They still want to be identified as part of the tribe.\" </p> <p>And at the end of the day, it is not as though staff at companies such as Andersen are known for their wild tastes outside work. \"Accountants have always had a uniform,\" says Cary Cooper, an organisational psychology professor at the university of Manchester's institute of science and technology. \"It makes them feel secure.
