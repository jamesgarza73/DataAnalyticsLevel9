No one can be sure who fired first, but yesterday at least four more people were added to the growing list of victims of the country's brutal nine-year civil war after a gun battle near the house of the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh.

I'm told this focused in particular on Roy Jenkins, from whose rotundities the downbeat chat of leader Kennedy could hardly be more different. Arguably he's still more interested in style than content, though yesterday's launch of a high-powered group of economists to study the euro shows he understands what matters.

      "body": "<p>The problem</p> <p>I spent my 20s travelling, working overseas and doing various jobs, including becoming a qualified journalist and spending two years on a weekly newspaper. </p> <p>Now I am 30 years old and ready to commit to a career. I want it to be in the non-profit sector but I feel as if my age and the fact I have done so much travelling is going against me. I am more reliable than a 20-year-old, fresh from university who has seen nothing of the world and will soon get disillusioned about and leave to do precisely what I did. It is so frustrating trying to convince employers I am an intelligent woman with a huge range of useful work skills and experience. <strong>Jo Harper</strong></p> <p><strong>The solution</strong></p> <p>The problem is that you might be ready to commit to a career but potential employers don't know this. All they can see is a track record that screams short-term to them. While you may have spent the last ten years gaining valuable experiences and skills in different jobs and countries, to the employer, you are someone with wanderlust, who cannot stay in the same job or location for more than five minutes.</p> <p>So, the question is, how can you turn the apparent pitfalls of your varied experiences into the advantages that they really are? I think you are going on the wrong track if you think that the problem is trying to convince employers that you are intelligent with a huge range of useful work skills and experience - this is probably not contested. The hurdle you need to overcome is convincing them, not that you can do the job, but that you are going to be around long enough for them to invest in you.</p> <p>To achieve this, your covering letter with your application needs to be blunt and to the point. You need to state clearly that, while you have benefited enormously from travelling and a variety of jobs, your travelling days are over and you are looking for a permanent post.</p> <p>You should also look carefully at where you are targeting your applications. I wonder whether you are actually selling yourself short and going for jobs that you are far too skilled for, if you are competing against 20-year-old graduates? Find yourself a mentor in the industry (by ringing up various companies, even ones who reject you, and arranging meetings or chats with key personnel who may be able to give you some tips or even work experience) who can help you with your marketing and help you get a foot in the door.</p> <p>Be persistent - you will get there in the end!</p> <p>Dr Sandi Mann is author of <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501952039,00.html\">Psychology Goes To Work</a> and <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501007347,00.html\">Hiding What We Feel, Faking What We Don't</a></p>",

I am more reliable than a 20-year-old, fresh from university who has seen nothing of the world and will soon get disillusioned about and leave to do precisely what I did. It is so frustrating trying to convince employers I am an intelligent woman with a huge range of useful work skills and experience. Jo Harper The solution The problem is that you might be ready to commit to a career but potential employers don't know this. All they can see is a track record that screams short-term to them. While you may have spent the last ten years gaining valuable experiences and skills in different jobs and countries, to the employer, you are someone with wanderlust, who cannot stay in the same job or location for more than five minutes. So, the question is, how can you turn the apparent pitfalls of your varied experiences into the advantages that they really are? I think you are going on the wrong track if you think that the problem is trying to convince employers that you are intelligent with a huge range of useful work skills and experience - this is probably not contested. The hurdle you need to overcome is convincing them, not that you can do the job, but that you are going to be around long enough for them to invest in you. To achieve this, your covering letter with your application needs to be blunt and to the point. You need to state clearly that, while you have benefited enormously from travelling and a variety of jobs, your travelling days are over and you are looking for a permanent post. You should also look carefully at where you are targeting your applications. I wonder whether you are actually selling yourself short and going for jobs that you are far too skilled for, if you are competing against 20-year-old graduates? Find yourself a mentor in the industry (by ringing up various companies, even ones who reject you, and arranging meetings or chats with key personnel who may be able to give you some tips or even work experience) who can help you with your marketing and help you get a foot in the door. Be persistent - you will get there in the end! Dr Sandi Mann is author of Psychology Goes To Work and Hiding What We Feel, Faking What We Don't",

Even though it spans just 14 years of repertory, its stylistic range feels like decades. Mikhail Fokine's The Firebird (1910) - once considered pioneering in its muscular, folkloric energy and exotic colour - now looks like an intimate descendant of 19th-century ballet, while Bronislava Nijinska's Les Biches (1924) inhabits a sharply 20th-century world. Though it flaunts a far more classical virtuosity than The Firebird, the choreography's sly comments on sexual mores - both on and off the stage - evoke a sophisticated and very modern sensibility. </p> <p>Both works have been danced by the Royal before but Vaslav Nijinksy's legendary L'Apres-Midi d'un Faune (1912) is a company premiere. This ballet is a stark, irreducible original, and under the excellent direction of Anne Hutchinson Guest the Royal's revival produces a genuine shiver of history. When the curtain first opens on Bakst's molten, sensuous backdrop, with the Faun lying in a pool of antique light, it is like seeing a much reproduced painting spring to life. </p> <p>The dancers perform with real care, finding dramatic truth in the choreography's stiffly archaic poses without trespassing beyond their austere stylistic bounds. Carlos Acosta (dancing with the second cast) can't quite repress his habitual laddishness but his alert, feral energy makes the Faun a true savage, while Irek Mukhamedov (dancing with the first) is very monumental, very iconic. Zenaida Yanowksy, outstandingly, finds an innocence and gravity in the role of the Chief Nymph that are almost spookily of another era. </p> <p>The Royal is also giving its first performances of Nijinsky's lost Bloomsbury ballet Jeux (1913), as reconstructed by Millicent Hodson and Kenneth Archer. Hodson and Archer carefully describe their staging as being \"after Nijinsky\" since they had no notation to work from, only old photographs, sketches and descriptions. </p> <p>When it was first premiered in Verona this version of Nijinsky's erotically ambiguous but formally severe trio had a staccato, imagistic quality. The more ambitiously worked Royal staging foregrounds an element of joined-up dancing that, rightly or wrongly, dilutes the ballet's strangeness. Yet Nijinsky's spirit still haunts the choreography's mechanistic rhythms, its solidly sculpted poses and oddly oriental detail, and both casts perform with an intelligence that gives real theatrical integrity to this admittedly hybrid piece. </p> <p>Some may argue that Hodson and Archer shouldn't meddle with a revival whose authenticity they can't guarantee. The rest of us are glad to get even a sidelong view of this extraordinary period vignette. </p> <p> Until May 20. Box office: 020-7304 4000.</p>",

That it was seen as a bit of a wheeze in America but that they then thought an even greater joke would be to ship it across to the UK to see if we fall for it, like we fell for those other two cultural jokes - dressing down and the open plan office. And guess what - it worked. I think workers in the US secretly wear navy suits and sit in their own private offices, using their own little mono-sex loos, laughing their socks off at us. </p> <p><strong>Toilet imaging</strong></p> <p>The message from the unisex loo may be that your company is progressive, keen to change with the times, and possibly a bit naive and barking into the bargain.</p> <p>But what about the other forms of corporate hospitality? Here is the low-down on the loos on offer at a company near you:</p> <p><strong>The school run</strong></p> <p>This company toilet is run along strict lines by an anonymous but omnipotent concierge who must have done her training at an army boot camp. The handwash water is scolding and the soap smells of carbolic. There is a ceiling-high auto air-freshener with a sensory trip-switch that dispels clouds of lavender-scented CS gas the minute you stand near it and raise the pollution levels. </p> <p>There are notes pinned everywhere, telling you to FLUSH! and NOW PLEASE WASH YOUR HANDS! There is a basket of pot-pourri next to the taps and a six-pack of air freshener waiting beside it in case of environmental emergencies. </p> <p><strong>Image: </strong>Your company is run along school lines, possibly by an anally-retentive puritan who believes you are not to be trusted. This company will be a hard one to progress in until you have proved yourself to be very grown up, which probably won't happen until you are clearing fifty. There is no scope for creativity in this place. They relish detail and traditional procedures. If you come up with a new idea you will need to prove how closely it matches one already in existence.</p> <p><strong>The hi-tech</strong></p> <p>This toilet is like a shrine to minimalism and modern design. No-one really knows how it all works but no-one likes to let on, so staff watch one another surreptitiously for clues about the hand-drier and door locks, a bit like watching other diners to see which knife to use in a posh restaurant.</p> <p>There are no knobs, switches or lids visible to the naked eye. If you manage to suss out the well-concealed paper towel dispenser you will never find the bin to put it in and will probably emerge with a couple stored in your handbag, to throw away once you get home. </p> <p><strong>Image: </strong>This company relishes the cult of the new. If you are over thirty you may possibly need to start hunting for a new job. Knowing how this toilet functions is vital to business success. Image is all in this company. If you want to impress this boss make sure you sport a pair of weirdo designer-frame specs and a palm-size laptop.</p> <p><strong>The pamper parlour</strong></p> <p>This toilet is like a celebration of womanhood. Every need is catered for, including some you never knew you might have. There are perfume sprays, sewing kits, hand-cream dispensers, hair combs, machines selling tights and an industrial skip-load of personal hygiene products.</p> <p><strong>Image: </strong>Don't be too fooled by this feminity-fest. Rather than relishing their female staff this company could really rather fear them. If the delights on offer are a little too comprehensive, and even include deodorants and tooth cleaning kits, it may be that this is the equivalent to a corporate sheep dip. </p> <p>This company wants its women hassle-free, spruced up and looking good. By providing everything in the one small area the idea is that nothing bad leaks out back in the office, like laddered tights or dandruff. If you want to do well here make sure you are immaculately turned out. One hair out of place and you could be banished to the bog until you improve.</p> <p><strong>Workers' paradise</strong> </p> <p>This toilet is the one where colleagues gather to continue business discussions. It is decorated in exactly the same style as the boardroom and hosts similar lighting. There are chairs in groups for longer discussions and the company tannoy can page you in there even louder than it can outside.</p> <p><strong>Image: </strong>There really is no hiding place in this company, which will want its pound of flesh in terms of commitment and hours worked, and then some. Welcome to the world of the power lunch, the working commute and the evening homework. If you cherish your private and social life it could be time to move onward and upward.</p>",

Here is the low-down on the loos on offer at a company near you: The school run This company toilet is run along strict lines by an anonymous but omnipotent concierge who must have done her training at an army boot camp. The handwash water is scolding and the soap smells of carbolic. There is a ceiling-high auto air-freshener with a sensory trip-switch that dispels clouds of lavender-scented CS gas the minute you stand near it and raise the pollution levels. There are notes pinned everywhere, telling you to FLUSH! and NOW PLEASE WASH YOUR HANDS! There is a basket of pot-pourri next to the taps and a six-pack of air freshener waiting beside it in case of environmental emergencies. Image: Your company is run along school lines, possibly by an anally-retentive puritan who believes you are not to be trusted. This company will be a hard one to progress in until you have proved yourself to be very grown up, which probably won't happen until you are clearing fifty. There is no scope for creativity in this place. They relish detail and traditional procedures. If you come up with a new idea you will need to prove how closely it matches one already in existence. The hi-tech This toilet is like a shrine to minimalism and modern design. No-one really knows how it all works but no-one likes to let on, so staff watch one another surreptitiously for clues about the hand-drier and door locks, a bit like watching other diners to see which knife to use in a posh restaurant. There are no knobs, switches or lids visible to the naked eye. If you manage to suss out the well-concealed paper towel dispenser you will never find the bin to put it in and will probably emerge with a couple stored in your handbag, to throw away once you get home. Image: This company relishes the cult of the new. If you are over thirty you may possibly need to start hunting for a new job. Knowing how this toilet functions is vital to business success. Image is all in this company. If you want to impress this boss make sure you sport a pair of weirdo designer-frame specs and a palm-size laptop. The pamper parlour This toilet is like a celebration of womanhood. Every need is catered for, including some you never knew you might have. There are perfume sprays, sewing kits, hand-cream dispensers, hair combs, machines selling tights and an industrial skip-load of personal hygiene products. Image: Don't be too fooled by this feminity-fest. Rather than relishing their female staff this company could really rather fear them. If the delights on offer are a little too comprehensive, and even include deodorants and tooth cleaning kits, it may be that this is the equivalent to a corporate sheep dip. This company wants its women hassle-free, spruced up and looking good. By providing everything in the one small area the idea is that nothing bad leaks out back in the office, like laddered tights or dandruff. If you want to do well here make sure you are immaculately turned out. One hair out of place and you could be banished to the bog until you improve. Workers' paradise This toilet is the one where colleagues gather to continue business discussions. It is decorated in exactly the same style as the boardroom and hosts similar lighting. There are chairs in groups for longer discussions and the company tannoy can page you in there even louder than it can outside. Image: There really is no hiding place in this company, which will want its pound of flesh in terms of commitment and hours worked, and then some. Welcome to the world of the power lunch, the working commute and the evening homework. If you cherish your private and social life it could be time to move onward and upward.",

At least, as the diehard Hornets supporters sang, they are \"going down with a smile\". </p> <p>Middlesbrough supporters might have been able to raise a grin, too, if they could have felt confident that Juninho, on loan from Atletico Madrid, will still be around next season. A pre-match poll showed they have made his signing Robson's No1 priority as he prepares to spend up to \u00a320m on new players. </p> <p>Juninho has indicated he is prepared to stay. \"I am very comfortable here,\" he said. \"The manager gave me the chance to play again.

At least, as the diehard Hornets supporters sang, they are \"going down with a smile\". Middlesbrough supporters might have been able to raise a grin, too, if they could have felt confident that Juninho, on loan from Atletico Madrid, will still be around next season. A pre-match poll showed they have made his signing Robson's No1 priority as he prepares to spend up to \u00a320m on new players. Juninho has indicated he is prepared to stay. \"I am very comfortable here,\" he said. \"The manager gave me the chance to play again. I just wanted to play. After the season, I will sit down and talk about what is best for the club and best for Juninho.\" The away fans' antics at least eased the tedium of an opening half-hour before Watford displayed the type of dreadful defending that has seen them concede 77 goals in the Premiership. The Middlesbrough defender Robbie Stockdale harried David Perpetuini into an underhit back-pass that induced a collision between the two players and the goalkeeper Chris Day.

The fatal injury occurred near 2.30pm, about the time the Rotherham manager Ronnie Moore, out on the pitch, was celebrating promotion by signing a new three-year contract. It sealed the success of the two Ronnies: Moore the striker also gained promotion with Rotherham. </p> <p>The club owe as much to their chairman Ken Booth, who balances their books with \u00a310,000 a week. It would be cheap to suggest that he makes his money from scrap and gives it to rubbish. The match was a mess but Rotherham played the more adventurous football. </p> <p>John Hollins, triumphant in two seasons at Swansea, said: \"We defended well. That's been our secret.\" Without two strikers, they defended deep and in numbers, with Matthew Bound and Steve Jones outstanding. A draw was enough for them. </p> <p>It would have been simpler had it been goalless. The award of two penalties, the first to Swansea in the 88th minute, meant the last two minutes lasted 22. </p> <p>With one Bound Swansea were clear. Lee Glover, who at one stage looked as if he might take his under mounted guard, converted 10 minutes after the award. The referee Rob Styles took the players off, having already sent off Darren Garner and Brian Wilsterman. </p> <p>Rotherham finished with nine men, Swansea with the title, and South Wales Police, relieved last week that Cardiff had gone the other way, with a headache for next season after all. </p> <p>What should have been shared celebration became shameful charade - prolonged by Nationwide's determination not to forgo a presentation photo opportunity - and ultimately tragedy. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The death of a Swansea supporter on Saturday night after he was trampled by a police horse outside the ground before the match rendered grotesque and inconsequential the between-times battle for the divisional title. Fighting with bricks and sticks broke out before and after the match and play was held up twice in the closing stages as police - some mounted, others with riot shields - kept fans apart and cleared two pitch invasions. There were 23 arrests, mostly for public-order offences. The fatal injury occurred near 2.30pm, about the time the Rotherham manager Ronnie Moore, out on the pitch, was celebrating promotion by signing a new three-year contract. It sealed the success of the two Ronnies: Moore the striker also gained promotion with Rotherham. The club owe as much to their chairman Ken Booth, who balances their books with \u00a310,000 a week. It would be cheap to suggest that he makes his money from scrap and gives it to rubbish. The match was a mess but Rotherham played the more adventurous football. John Hollins, triumphant in two seasons at Swansea, said: \"We defended well. That's been our secret.\" Without two strikers, they defended deep and in numbers, with Matthew Bound and Steve Jones outstanding. A draw was enough for them. It would have been simpler had it been goalless. The award of two penalties, the first to Swansea in the 88th minute, meant the last two minutes lasted 22. With one Bound Swansea were clear. Lee Glover, who at one stage looked as if he might take his under mounted guard, converted 10 minutes after the award. The referee Rob Styles took the players off, having already sent off Darren Garner and Brian Wilsterman. Rotherham finished with nine men, Swansea with the title, and South Wales Police, relieved last week that Cardiff had gone the other way, with a headache for next season after all. What should have been shared celebration became shameful charade - prolonged by Nationwide's determination not to forgo a presentation photo opportunity - and ultimately tragedy.",

At the final whistle they flooded the ground like a tide of light blue water. The great thing about being Manchester City is that every match is a home fixture.</p> <p>City, though, the \"cock-up kings\" according to their former chairman Franny Lee, have shot themselves in the foot on so many occasions that they take the field with a heavy limp.</p> <p>Under Alan Ball, the manager born with a wooden spoon in his mouth, they famously took the ball into the corner in 1996 to play out time during a 2-2 draw with Liverpool. A point, they thought, would be enough. It wasn't and they were relegated.</p> <p>This explains why their supporters have developed a nice line in black humour. It is dry and wry, gloomy and phlegmatic. The mood is darker and deeper than at probably any other club.</p> <p>Their manager Joe Royle has some humour too. \"We're runaway second,\" he quipped yesterday. \"We played like pigs in labour. But some pigs fly. After all that's happened to this club I think we deserved a kiss from Lady Luck.</p> <p>\"We have always had Premiership supporters. Now we have Premiership football too.\"</p> <p>Their supporters watched this match with a sort of referred pain as the news of Ipswich's match against Walsall came in.</p> <p>Either side of half-time it started to go wrong. First Matt Jansen, the best player on the pitch, scored for the clearly superior Blackburn side. Just after the break Blackburn hit the woodwork twice, to add to their two timber-rattling efforts of the first half. And then came the terrible news from Portman Road: Ipswich were winning.</p> <p>But once Shaun Goater volleyed City level the light blue masses pulled off their shirts and shouted their support and an unlikely confidence coursed through the visiting side.</p> <p>Great club. Great supporters. Top manager. Pity about the team. There is a shortage of real talent, if you except the goalkeeper Nicky Weaver, Mark Kennedy and Gerard Wiekens, who did not figure in yesterday's line-up.</p> <p>Their defence is also elderly and ponderous. Yesterday, when attacked directly and at pace, they appeared static and bewildered.</p> <p>It is reasonable to assume City would not have made it without their supporters, who backed the team with an average attendance of more than 28,000 in the Second Division last season. They are a miracle.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the prize was taken, the hundreds of Manchester City supporters who had been locked out, and had watched from a steep bank with a squinty view of one penalty area, swept down towards the ground in a scene stolen from Braveheart. They charged the gates like revolutionaries and shared their noisy ecstasy with those within, who officially numbered 6,000 but were in reality about twice that. At the final whistle they flooded the ground like a tide of light blue water. The great thing about being Manchester City is that every match is a home fixture. City, though, the \"cock-up kings\" according to their former chairman Franny Lee, have shot themselves in the foot on so many occasions that they take the field with a heavy limp. Under Alan Ball, the manager born with a wooden spoon in his mouth, they famously took the ball into the corner in 1996 to play out time during a 2-2 draw with Liverpool. A point, they thought, would be enough. It wasn't and they were relegated. This explains why their supporters have developed a nice line in black humour. It is dry and wry, gloomy and phlegmatic. The mood is darker and deeper than at probably any other club. Their manager Joe Royle has some humour too. \"We're runaway second,\" he quipped yesterday. \"We played like pigs in labour. But some pigs fly. After all that's happened to this club I think we deserved a kiss from Lady Luck. \"We have always had Premiership supporters. Now we have Premiership football too.\" Their supporters watched this match with a sort of referred pain as the news of Ipswich's match against Walsall came in. Either side of half-time it started to go wrong. First Matt Jansen, the best player on the pitch, scored for the clearly superior Blackburn side. Just after the break Blackburn hit the woodwork twice, to add to their two timber-rattling efforts of the first half. And then came the terrible news from Portman Road: Ipswich were winning. But once Shaun Goater volleyed City level the light blue masses pulled off their shirts and shouted their support and an unlikely confidence coursed through the visiting side. Great club. Great supporters. Top manager. Pity about the team. There is a shortage of real talent, if you except the goalkeeper Nicky Weaver, Mark Kennedy and Gerard Wiekens, who did not figure in yesterday's line-up. Their defence is also elderly and ponderous. Yesterday, when attacked directly and at pace, they appeared static and bewildered. It is reasonable to assume City would not have made it without their supporters, who backed the team with an average attendance of more than 28,000 in the Second Division last season. They are a miracle.",

The experiment was led by paediatrician Professor David Southall, who was suspended from the hospital in December 1999. Parents of some of the babies claim the results of the experiment do not compare favourably with conventional treatment. The inquiry team said today that they had referred to the General Medical Council claims that parents' signatures on consent forms had been forged. The government said today it accepted all the recommendations made in Professor Griffiths' report and had already begun putting them into place. But health minister Lord Hunt said there still needed to be a \"culture change\" in the NHS to empower patients. The Continuous Negative Extrathoracic Pressure (CNEP) ventilator worked by putting babies in low-pressure tanks which forced their lungs to expand, a move intended to aid their breathing. The inquiry into the research at the hospital was triggered when Llin Golding, Labour MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, was approached by a family affected by the ventilator treatment.

He said the children involved were gravely ill and that mortality rates among a similar study group were broadly similar to those in the CNEP trials. He said research guidance needed to be developed, brought up to date and issued in a bid to retain public confidence in medical research with the NHS. Prof Griffiths also called for new guidelines to ensure children's welfare is safeguarded during covert surveillance of children deemed at risk of harm from their parents, step-parents or carers, after controversial research showed that 34 out of 39 parents suspected of cruelty to their children had tried to harm them when left alone. Five parents admitted killing other children and 34 were convicted of offences on evidence from the team, according to reports.

      "body": "<p><strong>IN-SOL-UBLE</strong></p> <p>To White Hart Lane once more, and the continuing debate as to how rubbish Spurs will be next season. Pundits, punters and papers alike seem confident that they will be very rubbish, not fit to wear the shirt, and an insult to a 500-year tradition of amazing fantastic attacking football etc. The club meanwhile is convinced that George Graham's team will be far from rubbish - the anti-rubbish in fact. But which side has got it right?</p> <p>Take the issue of Sol Campbell. If you listen to the media, then the Spurs captain is absolutely definitely on for a move to Old Trafford this summer. David Pleat, Director of Football at Spurs (pull a string in his back and watch him say \"no\"!) is of a different mind. \"Sol has said that he won't be going anywhere this summer,\" he said today. \"Whatever happens, he will stay and see out his contract.\"</p> <p>You may find this strange, seeing as Campbell himself has always maintained he would only decide on his future this summer. But for Pleat the summer is now. \"The sun is now shining, it is summer, and we are talking with Sol literally now,\" he said, while literally talking to 5 Live.</p> <p>Another non-issue is the future of David Ginola. The mercurial (ie poisonous if you eat him) Frenchman has featured less and less for Spurs of late. Many, including the estimable Richard Littlejohn*, believe that Ginola is being forced out of the club. Ginola himself has said: \"If I cannot start, I will not play.\" But here's George Graham: \"David has an important part to play for Tottenham next season. I want him to stay.\" Clearer now? Thought not.</p> <p> *Has anyone else noticed a complete lack of resemblance between the affable liberal-minded Richard Littlejohn of the BBC's 6:06 and the rabid right-wing Sun columnist of the same name?

FERGUSON'S HOLIDAY</strong></p> <p>\"756, 755, 754.\" That's the sound of Money Martin Edwards last week, joyously counting down the number of days before the Imperial Lord Ferg's retirement on his special Red Devil's abacus (a snip at \u00a369.99 from the club shop). \"Noooooooooooo!!!\" That's the blood-curdling scream that coming from Mart's bathroom yesterday, after he read Fergie's announcement in the News of the Screws that: \"I'd like to stay here after my current two years are up.\" \"He f@*#ing wants what?!!!\" will no doubt be Mr Edwards exasperated reaction today. Because Ferg has outlined his plans after his contract runs out in 2002 - and it's the sort of role that could keep him at the club forever AND burn a hole big hole in his chairman's pockets. \"I would like to travel and see certain places properly, like Australia, South America or China where I've never been,\" Ferg tells the Scotsman. \"In football we travel the world, but we don't get a chance to see these places.\"</p> <p>Fair enough you might think. But wily old Ferg believes he can do it on the cheap, by acting as a kind of global ambassador for the club. The sort of role which will involve him passing around the Ferrero Roche during receptions on his luxury United yacht, engaging in psychological mind-games with various heads of state, and not much else.</p> <p>\"Retirement for me would be about remaining just active enough to spread out the week,\" Ferg happily admits. \"Two or three days' work and three or four days off to pursue other interests. And the odd fortnight here or there to allow me to visit the countries I've talked about.\" </p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"If I believe what I hear I am scared - I will have to play myself next season!\" Arsene Wenger on the Overmars/Petit/Parlour to Barca/Real/Enfield rumours.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>WORSER AND WORSERER</strong></p> <p>Keep your votes coming for the Fiver's worst player of the season 1999-2000.

Sadly there aren't any of them around, so we're going to have to make do with a bunch of opinionated accountants instead.</p> <p>Deloitte and Touche have just completed their annual survey of Premiership fortunes and have found that while the average income of a Premiership club has risen to \u00a333.5 million , so has expenditure, with every side apart from Leeds, Aston Villa and Man Utd spending over 50% of their income on wages.</p> <p>The bean counters have put their minds to it and decided that such hefty spending is not healthy. \"Liverpool might see themselves slipping back into being an average club and want to do something about it\", said Robert Elstone, one of D&amp;T's top team. \"But the money has to be borrowed and that increases debt, which must be paid back eventually.\" But while it may be ok for Liverpool, \"For someone like Southampton with a limited income, it is a huge risk.\"</p> <p>All of which suggests that if you're not big, you shouldn't bother. Or as D&amp;T put it so smartly: \"Within any key formula of economic value the key driver is probably the size of the fan base.\" But rather than trying to redress the imbalance in a system that had worked ok for over a century D&amp;T reckon that \"the Premier League table of the future may feature large single-team cities or regions\" and that today's discoveries \"might even prompt a few Football League mergers.\" Let's hope so eh?</p> <p>Get more exciting figures <a href=\"http://dev.rjd.co.uk/news/080500.html\">here</a>. </p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Rangers have bid \u00a310m for Juventus' former Sheffield Wednesday star Darko Kovacevic.

      "bodyText": "IN-SOL-UBLE To White Hart Lane once more, and the continuing debate as to how rubbish Spurs will be next season. Pundits, punters and papers alike seem confident that they will be very rubbish, not fit to wear the shirt, and an insult to a 500-year tradition of amazing fantastic attacking football etc. The club meanwhile is convinced that George Graham's team will be far from rubbish - the anti-rubbish in fact. But which side has got it right? Take the issue of Sol Campbell. If you listen to the media, then the Spurs captain is absolutely definitely on for a move to Old Trafford this summer. David Pleat, Director of Football at Spurs (pull a string in his back and watch him say \"no\"!) is of a different mind. \"Sol has said that he won't be going anywhere this summer,\" he said today. \"Whatever happens, he will stay and see out his contract.\" You may find this strange, seeing as Campbell himself has always maintained he would only decide on his future this summer. But for Pleat the summer is now. \"The sun is now shining, it is summer, and we are talking with Sol literally now,\" he said, while literally talking to 5 Live. Another non-issue is the future of David Ginola. The mercurial (ie poisonous if you eat him) Frenchman has featured less and less for Spurs of late. Many, including the estimable Richard Littlejohn*, believe that Ginola is being forced out of the club. Ginola himself has said: \"If I cannot start, I will not play.\" But here's George Graham: \"David has an important part to play for Tottenham next season. I want him to stay.\" Clearer now? Thought not. *Has anyone else noticed a complete lack of resemblance between the affable liberal-minded Richard Littlejohn of the BBC's 6:06 and the rabid right-wing Sun columnist of the same name? Are they by any chance not related? * * * * * * * * * * * * * ME? WITH A DAILY EMAIL UPDATE ON EVERYTHING EURO 2000? WITH MY REPUTATION?

FERGUSON'S HOLIDAY \"756, 755, 754.\" That's the sound of Money Martin Edwards last week, joyously counting down the number of days before the Imperial Lord Ferg's retirement on his special Red Devil's abacus (a snip at \u00a369.99 from the club shop). \"Noooooooooooo!!!\" That's the blood-curdling scream that coming from Mart's bathroom yesterday, after he read Fergie's announcement in the News of the Screws that: \"I'd like to stay here after my current two years are up.\" \"He f@*#ing wants what?!!!\" will no doubt be Mr Edwards exasperated reaction today. Because Ferg has outlined his plans after his contract runs out in 2002 - and it's the sort of role that could keep him at the club forever AND burn a hole big hole in his chairman's pockets. \"I would like to travel and see certain places properly, like Australia, South America or China where I've never been,\" Ferg tells the Scotsman. \"In football we travel the world, but we don't get a chance to see these places.\" Fair enough you might think. But wily old Ferg believes he can do it on the cheap, by acting as a kind of global ambassador for the club. The sort of role which will involve him passing around the Ferrero Roche during receptions on his luxury United yacht, engaging in psychological mind-games with various heads of state, and not much else. \"Retirement for me would be about remaining just active enough to spread out the week,\" Ferg happily admits. \"Two or three days' work and three or four days off to pursue other interests. And the odd fortnight here or there to allow me to visit the countries I've talked about.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"If I believe what I hear I am scared - I will have to play myself next season!\" Arsene Wenger on the Overmars/Petit/Parlour to Barca/Real/Enfield rumours. * * * * * * * * * * * * * WORSER AND WORSERER Keep your votes coming for the Fiver's worst player of the season 1999-2000. The shortlist is comprised of: Chris Sutton, Mickael Silvestre, Dagenham Davor Suker, Wim Jonk and Steffen Freund, and the results will be announced on Friday. Have your say at the.boss@theguardian.com * * * * * * * * * * * * * THANK GOD FOR ACCOUNTANTS With the future of the game up in the air, football is crying out for leadership. The game needs decision-makers as never before, men and women who will take the tough choices to benefit the sport they love. Sadly there aren't any of them around, so we're going to have to make do with a bunch of opinionated accountants instead. Deloitte and Touche have just completed their annual survey of Premiership fortunes and have found that while the average income of a Premiership club has risen to \u00a333.5 million , so has expenditure, with every side apart from Leeds, Aston Villa and Man Utd spending over 50% of their income on wages. The bean counters have put their minds to it and decided that such hefty spending is not healthy. \"Liverpool might see themselves slipping back into being an average club and want to do something about it\", said Robert Elstone, one of D&amp;T's top team. \"But the money has to be borrowed and that increases debt, which must be paid back eventually.\" But while it may be ok for Liverpool, \"For someone like Southampton with a limited income, it is a huge risk.\" All of which suggests that if you're not big, you shouldn't bother. Or as D&amp;T put it so smartly: \"Within any key formula of economic value the key driver is probably the size of the fan base.\" But rather than trying to redress the imbalance in a system that had worked ok for over a century D&amp;T reckon that \"the Premier League table of the future may feature large single-team cities or regions\" and that today's discoveries \"might even prompt a few Football League mergers.\" Let's hope so eh? Get more exciting figures here. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Rangers have bid \u00a310m for Juventus' former Sheffield Wednesday star Darko Kovacevic. But Kovacevic insists he is happy in Italy and has bad memories of his last stay in Britain. \"I am a loyal person, first to my wife, family and friends and then of course to Juventus,\" he said. \"According to my contract, I'm obligated to the club until 2004 and I'm happy.\" Chelsea could move for both Gareth Barry and Gary McAllister this summer. Apparently Gianluca Vialli has asked John Gregory to name his price for central defender Barry. Marc Overmars is likely to stay at Arsenal next season. The Dutch winger had been tipped for a move to Barcelona but, after the Gunners qualified for the Champions League last weekend, he appears to have changed his mind. \"I am pleased we have made it because I have to play at the highest level,\" he said, adding \"I see a lot of good things happening here.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Manchester City chairman David Bernstein has promised to bankroll Joe Royle's Premiership campaign. He said: \"We will be able to raise the money. I am confident Joe will have whatever resources he will need to keep the club in the Premiership. His requests are always sensible, and he has done a really wonderful job.\" Kevin Keegan has guaranteed Graeme Le Saux a place in his Euro 2000 squad - if he can prove his fitness. Keegan said: \"I'll be absolutely delighted if he is considered fit enough to play in the cup final or in one league game and then the cup final. If he was fit then, there's no doubt about it, he would be in the squad.\" Dundee have confirmed that the contracts of manager Jocky Scott and his assistant Jimmy Bone will not be renewed when they expire in the summer. Notts County chairman Derick Pavis is preparing to sell the world's oldest league club. He said: \"All things being equal, Notts County will have a new chairman and new owners by the start of next season.\" Fat Les 2000 will release their version of Jerusalem - England's official song for Euro 2000 - on May 29th.

However, Ms Gavron, who will meet Mr Livingstone this morning to discuss his offer of the deputy mayorship for a year, is an enthusiast for his new coalition politics and privately feels certain her Labour colleagues will expect her to accept. Mr Livingstone sees her as acting as the bridge between the mayor and the assemby, as well as being responsible for strategic planning in his cabinet. The Labour group's decision will set the broader framework for the relationship between Labour and Mr Livingstone in the run-up to the next general election. Tony Blair spoke to Mr Livingstone for 20 minutes on Saturday, and Downing Street hinted strongly yesterday that they would be willing to see Labour GLA members serve in the Livingstone adminstration. Labour won nine seats in the assembly, the same as the Conservatives, with three falling to the Greens and four to the Liberal Democrats. One of Mr Livingstone's first appoinments at the weekend was Lee Jasper, a radical black activist, who will advise the mayor on race relations and liaison with the Metropolitan Police. Mr Jasper, secretary of the National Assembly Against Racism, was a member of Scotland Yard's lay advisory group set up in the wake of the Stephen Lawrence report. In October last year he resigned after a row over allegations that its members who counselled black and Asian victims at the Paddington rail crash were cold shouldered by police officers. He believes the police should be stripped of the role of training new recruits and internal discipline, with a greater role for the community.

      "bodyText": "The chances of Tony Blair's government marking the fourth anniversary of its 1997 election landslide with a spring general election next year look significantly slimmer in the wake of the local and London mayoral polls. Earlier today, Gordon Brown became the most senior member of the government to hint that the next election could be delayed beyond the widely predicted date of May 2001. On Radio 4's Today programme, the chancellor stressed that Labour was playing for the \"long term\" and was implementing \"radical and sometimes controversial measures\" which would take some time to deliver. His comments add public impetus to the weight of backroom pressure on the prime minister from senior cabinet colleagues to resist going to the country for a fresh mandate until autumn next year. Ministers including Peter Mandelson and Mr Brown - Labour's two leading election strategists - deputy prime minister John Prescott and leader of the house Margaret Beckett are all understood to oppose an election this May. Under UK electoral rules, the prime minister chooses the general election date and is not bound, as in other countries, by a fixed term, though the maximum period between general elections in peacetime is five years. The prime argument which may persuade Mr Blair to delay a poll until the autumn is the concern that May 2001 may be too early to demonstrate government delivery of key promises and to renew enthusiasm among disillusioned core supporters. By confining itself to Tory-set spending limits for its first two years in office, the Labour government left voters hanging on for noticeable change, party sources acknowledge. \"Now that the money really is going in, it seems wiser to wait until people really see the evidence in schools and hospitals rather than rush in when the Tories can still claim we haven't made a difference,\" says one MP. One advantage of a May general election would be the scope to use next year's Budget (in March) as a springboard, sending voters to the polls buoyed at the prospect of tax giveaways or cash for public services. On the other hand, others argue, an autumn poll would allow the promised money to have filtered through to the voters' pockets. Mr Blair will have to choose the key point which will allow the government to sell its message of \"a lot done, a lot to do\": too early, and the difficulty of conveying the first part is clear; too late - into the fifth year, say - and the momentum of the first Blair term could flag. Labour strategists will also have an eye on the polling strength of William Hague's Tories, with reference to the third part of the Labour election mantra: \"a lot to fear from the Tories\". Analysis of general elections since the war shows that, on average, governments go to the country once every four years, with that period being the optimum one for prime ministers to choose when they are strongly enough placed to do so. John Major's experience in 1997, when the struggling Tories delayed polling day for the full five years in the hope that events could save them from inevitable defeat, will be fresh in Mr Blair's mind. However, he will also be aware of the dangers of permitting election speculation, thanks to the experiences of one of his own Labour predecessors, Jim Callaghan. In 1978, the then Labour prime minister allowed it to be understood that he would go to the country in the autumn, then shied away from the prospect until the following spring amid suggestions that the result would be a hung parliament. One Labour source said: \"Tony Blair is likely to want to scotch all this speculation soon, as he has with talk of reshuffles, and say 'I haven't made up my mind yet, and when I do the decision is my own.'\"",

Nevertheless, there is renewed optimism that a lasting peace is within reach after the IRA's announcement on Saturday that it would soon start to disarm. The British and Irish governments say the IRA pledge should clear the way for restoring power to Northern Ireland's administration on May 22, some three months after Westminster re-imposed direct rule. \"There are a number of issues which we have had concerns about and which we have been pursuing with the government and we are hoping to get a response from government on those issues in the course of the next few days,\" Mr Trimble said. He acknowledged, however, that the IRA statement agreeing to put its arms \"beyond use\" appeared to break new ground. The IRA has always rejected disarmament as equivalent to a surrender in its fight for a united Ireland. But the kind of disarmament now being offered would not require the IRA to hand over weapons publicly, only to identify the locations of its secret stockpiles.",

      "body": "<p>Linking is good: that's the start point. Isn't that what the net is all about - pointing people to other interesting places to visit to learn more about an issue? </p> <p>Take Chechnya: readers can find the inside story from Chechen rebels and the Russian government without looking too hard. Both sides offer fascinating insights into what's going on. But if you were to ask a Chechen or a Russian for their opinion you might get another view. You're linking to the site of a terrorist or an oppressive state, take your pick. </p> <p>But the hard truth is that sometimes sites have to link to places we don't like very much - how do I or anybody else have the right to censor another site, to deny access? The strength of the net is its roots in the free flow of communication - to give a window to an increasingly smaller world and to make it easier to find the answers to the questions. </p> <p>The problem is, links are starting to raise more questions than answers. The prevalence of hategroups - the anti-everythings who range from sad loners to violent supremacists - and their use of the net as a platform is posing the question: can mainstream websites go on linking unquestioningly? </p> <p>The net is so unfathomably big now that a simple query to Yahoo! or Alta Vista can bring back thousands of replies. So, people need to know which are the key sites, and which are the ones that will add to their understanding of an issue. Of course, not every website carries links but links are the currency of the net. It's one of the ironies: you want your site to be as sticky as hell, but users won't come if you don't take them on to other interesting places. </p> <p>Legally, publication of a website assumes you want to be linked to it. And it's a strange circular game: the more places you're linked from, the more traffic you get. The more sites you link to, the more people use you as their gateway to the net. </p> <p>It doesn't need much imagination to see what can happen. Compiling copy on paedophile rings, would you link to paedophile sites? I doubt anyone would be able to justify that. But if you were compiling a report on the far right and wanted to illustrate how it is pre senting itself, is it any better to link to a Nazi group's site? </p> <p>The internet is an information forum: by denying your readers a link, you are undoubtedly censoring them and restricting their access to information. </p> <p>It's how the choice is made that is key. Making sure it adds to the understanding of an issue is the point, and the line between that and gratuitousness is a very fine one. The law's not much help to site editors in handling this dilemma - there's only been one case in the UK on linking, which was a judgment over the Shetland Times' headlines being reproduced on another site. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://hatewatch.org\">Hatewatch</a> site brings up all these points and deals with them. Under the quote \"how it infuriates a bigot, when he is forced to drag out his dark convictions\" from author Logan Pearsall Smith, it lifts the rug on the world's nastiest sites, exposing the activities of extremists everywhere. It's basically a set of links: if you want to know what extremists are up to, here is the place to look: white supremacy, neo-nazism, anti-semitism next to black racism and anti-arab sites. It is a dictionary of hate. </p> <p>But surf around Hatewatch and you realise pretty quickly that it doesn't endorse these sites, or glamorise them: it exposes them. In much the same way as the magazine Searchlight uses the activities of racist groups to expose them. </p> <p>The opposite to Hatewatch is, ironically, the <a href=\"http://www.wiesenthal.com\">Simon Wiesenthal</a> centre's site, which publishes an inventory of hate sites - without much in the way of context at all. </p> <p>A basic disclaimer is often just a cop-out. There's no point saying you're not responsible for the content of another site and then linking to it without explaining what it is. But context is everything. If hate sites are linked to unquestioningly, how is a user to know that this is the site of a Nazi group and that is the home of a respected academic? And is one being given the same weight as the other? Looking at one site may help you understand an issue better, while another graphically illustrates a problem. Making sure that it's obvious which is which is the function of a responsible website. </p> <p>But they can't just be ignored, otherwise, what do you do with sites you don't like? Pretend they don't exist and brush them under the e-carpet? There can surely be no better way to encourage the growth of hate groups. If they operate in the dark, they can do what they want, unexposed. In the light, they have to justify their existence. If you can show what they are doing, the disease is easier to cure.</p> <p>Simon Rogers is deputy editor of Guardian Unlimited</p>",

But the hard truth is that sometimes sites have to link to places we don't like very much - how do I or anybody else have the right to censor another site, to deny access? The strength of the net is its roots in the free flow of communication - to give a window to an increasingly smaller world and to make it easier to find the answers to the questions. The problem is, links are starting to raise more questions than answers. The prevalence of hategroups - the anti-everythings who range from sad loners to violent supremacists - and their use of the net as a platform is posing the question: can mainstream websites go on linking unquestioningly? The net is so unfathomably big now that a simple query to Yahoo! or Alta Vista can bring back thousands of replies. So, people need to know which are the key sites, and which are the ones that will add to their understanding of an issue. Of course, not every website carries links but links are the currency of the net. It's one of the ironies: you want your site to be as sticky as hell, but users won't come if you don't take them on to other interesting places. Legally, publication of a website assumes you want to be linked to it. And it's a strange circular game: the more places you're linked from, the more traffic you get. The more sites you link to, the more people use you as their gateway to the net. It doesn't need much imagination to see what can happen. Compiling copy on paedophile rings, would you link to paedophile sites? I doubt anyone would be able to justify that. But if you were compiling a report on the far right and wanted to illustrate how it is pre senting itself, is it any better to link to a Nazi group's site? The internet is an information forum: by denying your readers a link, you are undoubtedly censoring them and restricting their access to information. It's how the choice is made that is key. Making sure it adds to the understanding of an issue is the point, and the line between that and gratuitousness is a very fine one. The law's not much help to site editors in handling this dilemma - there's only been one case in the UK on linking, which was a judgment over the Shetland Times' headlines being reproduced on another site. The Hatewatch site brings up all these points and deals with them. Under the quote \"how it infuriates a bigot, when he is forced to drag out his dark convictions\" from author Logan Pearsall Smith, it lifts the rug on the world's nastiest sites, exposing the activities of extremists everywhere. It's basically a set of links: if you want to know what extremists are up to, here is the place to look: white supremacy, neo-nazism, anti-semitism next to black racism and anti-arab sites. It is a dictionary of hate. But surf around Hatewatch and you realise pretty quickly that it doesn't endorse these sites, or glamorise them: it exposes them. In much the same way as the magazine Searchlight uses the activities of racist groups to expose them. The opposite to Hatewatch is, ironically, the Simon Wiesenthal centre's site, which publishes an inventory of hate sites - without much in the way of context at all. A basic disclaimer is often just a cop-out. There's no point saying you're not responsible for the content of another site and then linking to it without explaining what it is. But context is everything. If hate sites are linked to unquestioningly, how is a user to know that this is the site of a Nazi group and that is the home of a respected academic? And is one being given the same weight as the other? Looking at one site may help you understand an issue better, while another graphically illustrates a problem. Making sure that it's obvious which is which is the function of a responsible website. But they can't just be ignored, otherwise, what do you do with sites you don't like? Pretend they don't exist and brush them under the e-carpet? There can surely be no better way to encourage the growth of hate groups. If they operate in the dark, they can do what they want, unexposed. In the light, they have to justify their existence. If you can show what they are doing, the disease is easier to cure.

      "body": "<p>The first clue should have come when she gave up smoking. Elisabeth Murdoch, rarely seen without a Marlboro Light attached firmly to her elegant fingers, abstaining? It's the first sign of pregnancy. If it was an episode of EastEnders - and let's face it, the beings and doings of the Murdoch clan are the media world's favourite Australian soap opera - you'd know immediately that the character was secretly expecting. She even laughs mockingly at how dense the journalists gathered around her at a recent dinner must have been not to realise that her abstemiousness might have had a biological reason. I don't like to say that we ascribed it to her Californian ways. </p> <p>\"So, do you think people are really surprised?\" It's Thursday afternoon and she has digested the initial reports of her resignation from BSkyB. \"Murdoch quits the family firm\"; \"Trying to move out of the long shadow of the family empire\". The story has everything: young (31), glamorous, rich, blond heiress turns her back on Daddy's global media empire to go it alone. Late in the day her friends confirmed the missing link: she is pregnant by her super-connected partner, PR man Matthew Freud. </p> <p>Yes, I think people were pretty much surprised. \"Yeah . . . Well, I don't know how else they expected it would ever be done, though.\" </p> <p>The point, probably, is that few people did expect it ever to be done. Sure, there has been speculation that the managing director of Sky Networks might not always be happy in that rather nebulous role. Certainly the industry knew that her relationship with the previous two chief executives, Sam Chisholm and Mark Booth, was not all it might have been. Perhaps even her friends acknowledged that it would be better for Lis to strike out on her own. None the less, in all the talk of succession to the Murdoch throne, the word was that the eldest child of the second marriage, Elisabeth, was adamant she would take her place in her father's \"first among equals\" plan. Brothers Lachlan and James might have apparently won greater favour, with Lachlan at 28 marked out as the first of those equals, but she was not, we were assured as recently as last month in a Talk magazine profile, giving up without a fight. </p> <p>Until Wednesday and the announcement that this Murdoch was leaving. </p> <p>\"For the last six to nine months, I thought at some point in the future I would like to do my own thing, pursue my own opportunities, create my own culture and control my destiny. Yet [at Sky] every single day there's a new challenge, it's the most exciting company in the world, and I don't say that with any note of hype. So you think, 'oh well, I'll do it one day'. </p> <p>\"Then when Matthew and I found out that we were going to have another baby [they already have two children each], it sort of dawned on me that if there was ever a right time to alter my lifestyle and be in control of my own time . . .\" She immediately qualifies, rather defensively, \"it doesn't mean that you work any less hard - it just means that you are slightly more the master of your own destiny. And this was a really good time to do it. So I think it was a catalyst for me to be like 'OK, I am someone who can do this.' And I also thought that it was a good time from the perspective of where Sky is at the moment. </p> <p>\"It's a difficult decision . . .\" She laughs and tails off. \"To look around when you've been somewhere for four years, I mean this is partly family to me.\" Of course it is. It is the family business. \"Well, yeah.\" </p> <p>Suddenly the Vassar-educated media princess comes on like a guest on Oprah. \"But you know what? I'm never leaving the family business. I may be doing something different professionally at the moment, but I plan on having very close ties through that business with I hope our company and other people.\" </p> <p>She carries on, now sounding disturbingly like a member of the Mob. \"I will always be a part of that business. My brothers and I will always, always be a part of that business so to me it does not feel like leaving the family business . . . I just won't. </p> <p>\"I'm only 31 - I don't see this as something that means I would never, you know, go back to [News Corp] in some way. I think that would be ridiculous to say. Does that make sense?\" </p> <p>It does if you consider the company as something greater than a job to the Murdoch siblings; it is the family. From that, perhaps, comes the urge to have something of her own. To have always been part of it, to have always had the expectations and fought the battles might prove exhausting. Maybe the reported fear of the ex-matriarch, Anna - that her family would be torn apart by Rupert's unwillingness to settle the succession question - was justified. But Elisabeth will have none of the implication that she has taken an easy route out of full-frontal confrontation with her nearest and dearest. </p> <p>It's still a massive u-turn from the succession plan as it was understood and laid out: three Murdoch siblings, all thrusting to be awarded the big prize by their cautious father. She seems now to prefer to dismiss that as a myth. </p> <p>\"A lot of that comes externally - from external speculation about how we must operate and what our worldview must be. Ultimately the most important thing is, I would say, to sound incredibly Californian about it, self realisation.\" A deep sigh. \"I don't know how to express it other than to say I think there's been an enormous amount of labels and expectations that have been put on [us] and assumptions about all of us and it isn't necessarily the case.\" </p> <p>Her father, she says, was \"delighted\" to hear her plans. \"I think he's proud of what I achieved and appreciates my talents and he's really happy for me. He's very comfortable with it and it's not really a big issue. He's excited about the new venture and he's, you know, being a dad . . . I think if I said, 'Dad, I'm packing up, I'm going to be an electrical engineer, I'm going back to school,' that might get a reaction. But my dad is an entrepreneur by spirit and he understands that.\" </p> <p>So, alarmingly for the future of the soap, we got the Murdochs all wrong. It's really more like the Brady Bunch than the Ewings. \"I don't think you become a different person just because you make a lifestyle choice. I'm still a very ambitious person, I still want to make impact with whatever I do and that's not going to change. I'm staying in the business and I hope to be very successful. It's just about being able to focus on the bits that I love and really about being more flexible in my time.\" </p> <p>Aren't Murdochs supposed to be driven by a desire to take over the world? \"Being driven by greed is something no one in my family should ever be accused of. It's not about that. It's about the satisfaction you get out of what you do.\" </p> <p>Whatever the satisfactions and frustrations of her current role, it is a big step for her to walk away from Sky and the possibility of a different job there - the obvious one that has eluded her is chief executive. </p> <p>\"I'm at a level in my career where I expect to have a certain sense of autonomy. To do anything less would not be particularly satisfying. It's really about deciding at this point I would like to be my own boss, I would like to pick my own team - maybe to begin with on a smaller scale but it will be ultimately very satisfying, [the reason for quitting is] . . . not lack of another job here - being senior executive of a plc is a huge job. But it's a different world to operate in from being the proprietor of your own business.\" </p> <p>Is she disappointed that she'll never be chief executive of Sky? \"I want to pursue what I'm pursuing but no, no, it's not really been a factor in my thinking in any way whatsoever, no. Good question.\" </p> <p>But there was a time, with the launch of Sky Digital, when she was clearly the face and voice of the company, to the point where she submitted to makeovers and fashion shoots in women's magazines to promote the digital proposition. \"Exactly, well that came back to bite me in the butt, thank you very much. Everyone was saying 'Why did you do that?' Well, because I had to sell those fucking dishes . . .\" </p> <p>Though the dishes have sold, Murdoch did not make chief executive when Booth quit last year. She is quick to emphasise that Tony Ball, the man appointed over her head, has been utterly supportive about her decision. Reports suggested there had been fallings out at Sky and there were rumours of a \"stand-up row\" between the two just before she quit. Far from it, she insists: \"He has been by far the best person I've ever worked for. He's a leader. He is wonderful.\" She adds, wrily, that leaving Sky \"would have made more sense if it was a couple of years ago. Sometimes timing doesn't quite work out the way you think it's going to work out\". </p> <p> Her job changed considerably with the three bosses she's worked under. Initially, Chisholm put his \"graduate trainee\", as he liked to refer to her, in charge of satellite installation. Glamorous. \"Funnily enough, I think he did it just to give me a hard time but it was a very valuable experience of what this company is all about in terms of the scale of it and the customer service aspect of it and the nuts and bolts of it.\" </p> <p>When director of programmes David Elstein left, she was put in charge of programming, then under Ball she took on marketing as well. \"It's completely evolved. I got a lot done in original programming and Sky Pictures, with the brand and on air promotion and that was what I needed to do . . .\" Though the job is never finished, she says, she has done what she set out to do. She's proud of Sky One (\"my baby\"), the new Guardian Media Group/Sky joint venture channel Artsworld and her marketing campaigns. Mostly, though, she's proud that two and a half years ago she stood up at Edinburgh aged 29 and told the industry that digital multi-channel television would prove its saviour. \"I think it's starting to, I think people get that now. I hope I played a little part in that . . .\" </p> <p>David Bergg has arrived from ITV to run Sky One and Murdoch has launched her new marketing campaign with an animated Sky executive extolling the virtues of multi-channel choice. Sky Pictures, her film venture, has also borne fruit: \"We're about to have our first big movie and you think, 'God, I'd love to see another one'. But at least these things are out there in the open now. I can now leave them in very, very capable hands. So this probably isn't a bad time to go. We have addressed some of the issues that we have been carrying for a while.\" </p> <p>She won't talk about the new venture much, preferring to wait until she's got something to announce. But she will take the summer off to spend some time with her family, and take the rest of the run-up to the birth putting deals together. </p> <p>So where will she be in a year? \"Very successful, doing fantastic things with my new company and with a healthy new baby . . .\" She stops, realising the inadequacy of the answer. \"OK, I'll be smoking and drinking and very happy.\" </p> <p><strong>The highs and lows of Lis Murdoch's Sky career</strong></p> <p><strong> Highs</strong><br> </p> <p> * Being made general manager of BSkyB in February 1996, promoted to head of programming seven months later. Quickly establishes herself as queen of programming at (then) ailing Sky One, with brief to turn the channel into a general entertainment station to rival BBC1 and ITV. \"Call me Lis\" manner masked ruthless streak. </p> <p>* Poaching a clutch of A-list stars to bolster Sky's line-up. Barry Norman was prised away from the BBC to front Sky's film coverage, while comedians Harry Enfield and David Baddiel have also been signed up. Viewers have yet to see what Enfield and Baddiel have to offer. </p> <p> * Commissioning the Uncovered series. The combination of sun, sand and sex in the holiday resort docu-soaps proved irresistible, and the programmes were later snapped up by Channel 4, establishing Sky as a provider of programmes in its own right. </p> <p>* Dream Team: Murdoch was responsible for the trashy but successful football team-based series which won a clutch of broadcasting awards and is now in its third season. Interest from terrestrial broadcasters. </p> <p>* Meeting the public relations guru and friend of the stars, Matthew Freud. </p> <p><strong> Lows</strong><br> </p> <p> * Continued battles with successive chief executives. Had fiery relationship with her first - Sam Chisholm - who said charitably when ill-health forced him to leave Sky in 1997: \"I have a great admiration for Elisabeth.\" But added pointedly: \"We do not agree on everything. Ours is a creative medium - there are always disagreements.\" Passed over for the top job twice: Chisholm was replaced by Mark Booth, and Tony Ball pinched the top job last year. </p> <p>* Signing the Duchess of York as a chat-show host and broadcasting Chris Evans's radio breakfast show on the television. Both derided as turkeys. </p> <p> * Launch party for Sky Digital, masterminded by Freud. Turned into a mudbath at Battersea power station. Freud was said to be so distraught that he was seen kneeling on the ground, clutching his head. </p> <p>* Losing the first-screening rights to the US series Friends and ER, when Channel 4 snapped them up for \u00a3140m last year. The shows were two of the few jewels in Sky One's crown, and their loss was a massive blow. </p> <p>* The Strangerers sitcom - something complicated to do with aliens - which was universally panned and which even Tony Ball admitted this month was \"disappointing\".</p>",

Ours is a creative medium - there are always disagreements.\" Passed over for the top job twice: Chisholm was replaced by Mark Booth, and Tony Ball pinched the top job last year. * Signing the Duchess of York as a chat-show host and broadcasting Chris Evans's radio breakfast show on the television. Both derided as turkeys. * Launch party for Sky Digital, masterminded by Freud. Turned into a mudbath at Battersea power station. Freud was said to be so distraught that he was seen kneeling on the ground, clutching his head. * Losing the first-screening rights to the US series Friends and ER, when Channel 4 snapped them up for \u00a3140m last year. The shows were two of the few jewels in Sky One's crown, and their loss was a massive blow. * The Strangerers sitcom - something complicated to do with aliens - which was universally panned and which even Tony Ball admitted this month was \"disappointing\".",

The Clarus is a big family car that starts at a fiver under \u00a311,000. Even in these post competition commission days that's still dirt cheap, because even the entry level 1.8 SX comes with air-con, central locking and power assistance for the bits that need it.

If I'd attempted the same journey in a Vauxhall Vectra I would have had to be winched out, because the seats so uncomfortable. </p> <p>The Clarus drawbacks aren't too terrifying. The first minus mark goes to the fuel consumption, because the 2.0 litre manual can only manage 27.4mpg overall. And that's simply not good enough if you're a high-mileage driver. The second area of weakness is that the safety equipment isn't great.

To find the answer I asked CAP Monitor, whose job it is to estimate the likely future value of today's new cars. And at first sight their estimate of the \u00a312,495 Clarus 2.0 GSX's value after three years and 30,000 miles looks much worse than average for the class - because CAP think the Clarus will be worth just \u00a34,400. </p> <p>However, the Clarus is far cheaper than big-brand cars in its size category, and for \u00a312,500 you're usually only in Vauxhall Astra territory. Now the Astra is a very good car, and CAP confirm that a \u00a312,495 example will indeed be worth \u00a3800 more than the Kia when you come to sell.

Soon all of the major companies were producing \"budget supercars\". These cars were sold on machismo and speed. \"It snarls, it quivers, it leaps prairies at a single bound,\" claimed a 1970 advertisement for the Dodge Challenger; in 1969 pictures of a Plymouth Road Runner appeared above the line: \"Goes to show that nothing shrinks time and distance like cubic inches and a good induction system.\" The Belvedere GTX ad went one step further and claimed the car was \"strictly for the 'move over honey, and let the man drive' set\". </p> <p>The golden age of muscle cars was at the end of the 60s. Chrysler led the way, and in 1968 introduced the two most revered muscle cars of them all: the Plymouth Road Runner and the Dodge Super Bee. Plymouth realised that the youth market muscle cars were originally aimed at was being alienated by raised prices caused by an increasing number of \"must-have\" extras, so the Road Runner was a bare-bones car priced at just under $3,000. Most importantly, its 383ci big-block V-8 engine meant that it could run a quarter-mile in 13 seconds. \"You know those cartoons about a rapid bird with a 'beep-beep' voice and a penchant for squashing coyotes?\" asked the Roadrunner's advertising copy. \"Well, Plymouth's built a car with the same name. And personality. It's horn goes 'beep-beep'. And the beat goes on.\" Plymouth, formerly seen as staid, now had a rebellious, youthful image. </p> <p>The Super Bee was even more macho, and the epitome of no-frills performance. Dodge didn't bother including hub caps or hood hinges, but they did add mean-looking hood scoops to keep the 440 Magnum V-8 engine cool, with large red letters pro claiming \"Six Pack\" on either side of them.

Although classics like the Roadrunner and the Super Bee are rare and very expensive, equally stylish models like the Plymouth Satellite, the AMC Hornet and the Chevy Chevelle are available in the UK through magazines like Classic American and through dealers like American Car Imports. These don't make very good family cars - although huge, half of the space is taken up by the engine, and seating space is limited due to aerodynamic concerns - and they aren't the most economical cars to run. The most powerful ones, such as Dodge Challengers and Ford Torinos, do as little as nine miles to the gallon, but most will do around 15 to 20. As American pollution control is much tighter than in Europe, American cars will sail through roadside emission tests, and all cars made in 1971 or after take unleaded petrol.

      "body": "<p>On December 12, the Sunday Telegraph carried a story under the headline, \"Tests set to sharpen pupils' spelling skills\". It read: \"Primary school pupils are to be given annual spelling tests set by the government as part of a new drive to improve children's literacy. David Blunkett, the education secretary, will announce this week that every child between the ages of eight and 11 will be expected to master dozens of officially prescribed words each year.\" And then it listed some of the words they would be expected to know. Eight year olds would have to be able to spell words such as gnash, knickers and rhyme, nine year olds should be capable of handkerchief, corrosive and resurrection. Eleven year olds would have to be able to spell archaeology and aerodynamic. </p> <p>Well, it's an entertaining story, and it was immediately picked up by lots of other papers. The following morning the Guardian had the same report, augmented by a few comments from the teachers' unions. Two days later, the Daily Mail said that the Department for Education was so alarmed by falling standards that the new tests had been ordered, not by David Blunkett but by his colleague Estelle Morris. Each newspaper printed lists of the words children would be tested on. </p> <p>The story was fun because it played straight to every parent's anxiety about whether their child was underachieving. And the lists of words provided an instant parlour game. I know - I played it with an eight year old myself. The story also confirmed prejudices about the uselessness of teachers who had learned their trade in the 70s. And it showed - this was the importance of the story to the government - that the government was taking decisive action to make things better. </p> <p>There was only one thing wrong with this story. It wasn't true. Or rather it wasn't what it seemed. If you read some of the reports closely, they did not say in so many words what they were taken as saying. You could spot the giveaway words. But the inference drawn was that this was another set of tests which the nation's primary school children would have to sit each year. \"Primary schools are to be given annual spelling tests set by the government as part of a new drive to improve children's literacy,\" in the words of the original article. </p> <p>I called the organisation in charge of school examinations earlier this week. When are these tests being introduced, I asked their spokesman. \"They're not,\" he said. </p> <p>\"But what about all those news-paper reports last December? You mean they were all balls?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"The words are yours,\" he replied. </p> <p>It's a small example, and I wasn't being entirely fair. If you read the original report closely, there was nothing actually inaccurate about it. It didn't say, in so many words, that there will be yet another set of national exams. What was really happening was that a booklet was being sent out to primary schools, with ideas for improving literacy, including suggestions about playing charades and the like. But the impression conveyed was another matter. It was, in other words, a story which was very effectively spun. </p> <p>It doesn't matter much. There are much worse things going on. In March this year, Panorama demonstrated devastatingly how the government plays fast and loose with facts in its attempts to persuade us of how brilliant it is. The programme revealed the ingenious technique of double- and treble-counting figures for investment in the National Health Service, which meant that \u00a310.3bn of additional investment suddenly becomes, hey presto, \u00a321bn. And there was the habit of announcing the same funding increase time and again. So an extra \u00a330m to modernise NHS accident and emergency services was announced not once but four times over several months, so that if you blinked, it looked like \u00a3120m. This wasn't anything as concrete as an actual lie. But it was distinctly fishy. </p> <p>Now, I don't blame the government propaganda machine for doing its job as well as it can. Its business is to make the government look good. The machine is now, in the hands of Alastair Campbell and the Downing Street strategic communications unit, more sophisticated than it has ever been. And you have to admire its brilliance. Damn, the thing's so accomplished that it's able to get newspapers reporting things which haven't been said. In January this year, the Times gave an account of a speech in which Tony Blair savaged Ken Livingstone, when the reality was that the reported remarks were never made. The newspaper was going on a press release handed out before the speech was delivered: when it came to the event itself, confronted by irritable Livingstone supporters, Blair dropped the remarks that had been included in the pre-released version of his speech. </p> <p>I am sure this was just a genuine mistake, but it is symptomatic of something. So, too, is the phenomenon of reporting things before they happen - as in David Blunkett's announcement of new primary school spelling tests. Poor old Matthew Parris, the Times columnist and former Conservative MP, woke up at 6.30am one Sunday in January to hear Radio 5 Live tell him what the prime minister was \"expected to say\" in a live interview with David Frost in a couple of hours' time. Call me old-fashioned, but I thought what someone said in an interview rather depended on what they were asked. Alastair Campbell, who is an honourable man, says this \"expected to say\" line did not come from him. In which case, where did it come from? </p> <p>On the morning in question, the prime minister's spokesman found himself, he said, in the bizarre position of explaining to a BBC journalist what the prime minister had said in the course of the interview. You might have thought that the journalist could have found out by watching the interview, and discovering whether indeed the prime minister had said what he was expected to say. The journalist explained to Campbell that she had been too busy talking about what the prime minister was \"expected\" to say on other BBC outlets to watch the interview itself. It's a mad world, my masters. </p> <p>But there's worse even than this example. On another occasion, also in January, Campbell found himself handing out copies of a prime ministerial speech to journalists. He reports one of them saying \"What should we say about it?\", to which he replied, not unreasonably, \"Read it\". </p> <p>Even this isn't the worst example that I've come across recently. On one Thursday afternoon last December, a senior member of the No 10 staff was in one of the House of Commons bars. He was approached by a Sunday newspaper journalist. \"Got anything for me?\" said the reporter. \"The story I have been working on has collapsed and the newsdesk is demanding a front-page splash.\" No, said the man from No 10, nothing much happening at all now. To which he got the jaw-dropping reply, \"I'll just have to make it up then\" - and unbelievably, he did. </p> <p>A story appeared which was a figment of the reporter's imagination. And, because it was printed on a Sunday morning, all the ministers appearing on all the Sunday political chat shows had to spend the day commenting on a policy that did not exist. </p> <p>I am told - on good authority from a member of the House of Commons lobby - that this sort of thing is not confined to newspapers published on Sundays which happen to fall on a February 29. Don't get me wrong, I am not seeking to run down my parliamentary colleagues, most of whom are doing their level best to discover reality in a hall of mirrors. Their job is made no easier by the fact that the marketplace has become so ruthlessly competitive. Something very odd has happened. </p> <p>Once upon a time, in the famous phrase Stanley Baldwin borrowed from Rudyard Kipling, what newspaper proprietors were seeking was power (and as he put it \"power without responsibility, the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages\"). But nowadays, it increasingly seems to me that newspaper proprietors are a great deal less interested in power than they are in money. There is a simple rule we could apply here. It is this: good journalism is bad business and too often bad journalism is good business. </p> <p>Finding things out, as anyone who has done any investigative journalism knows, takes time, and time is money. Resources are now so stretched on some newsdesks that no one can spare the time to research a story properly. The consequence is that they are increasingly dependent on what they are told. </p> <p>And while demand has multiplied, supply is more or less static. One of the oddest manifestations of this tension is the fight to be first with the story. In a 24-hour news culture, what is the point of a newspaper telling you what you think you already know? That is the explanation for all the \"expected to say\" stories. It can mean that the actual announcement is scarcely covered before the caravan moves on to the next pre-emptive policy disclosure and another occasion for spin. In this world, if you keep moving fast enough the referee hasn't got time to see the dirty tackle. </p> <p>So, how do we survive spin? The first thing I think we could all usefully do is to stop whingeing about it. Spin-doctors and their pals are the inevitable accoutrements of democracy in a mass media age. They're on the other side of the fence, that's all. </p> <p>Our approach ought to be to continue doing what we should have been doing all along. It is our job to find out things that people do not want to have found out. But for journalists to function properly, they have to be given freedom and resources. And those will come only from organisations which believe that their first duty is disclosure, not entertainment. </p> <p>I suggest that it is a sound principle never to treat any comment from any spokesman for any vested interest with anything other than profound scepticism, never to ask for a story, but to find it out for yourself, and if you are ever given a story to ask first why you are being given it. </p> <p>There is nothing scientific about our trade. Nor, apart from a few basic tricks, can it really be taught. The great Sunday Times journalist Nicholas Tomalin once listed the three prerequisites for a journalist as being a plausible manner, a little literary ability and rat-like cunning. They remain as true as ever. But essentially journalism is a matter of instinct, the expression of primitive curiosity and an instinctive urge to cause trouble, to be difficult, coupled with an atavistic distrust of anyone in authority </p> <p>In the spin doctor's ideal world, all is managed, smoothed and predictable. In the journalist's ideal world, all is chaos and confusion. It is our duty to bite the hand that feeds us. </p> <p>This article is extracted from the Philip Geddes Memorial Lecture, which Jeremy Paxman delivered on May 5</p>",

The story also confirmed prejudices about the uselessness of teachers who had learned their trade in the 70s. And it showed - this was the importance of the story to the government - that the government was taking decisive action to make things better. There was only one thing wrong with this story. It wasn't true. Or rather it wasn't what it seemed. If you read some of the reports closely, they did not say in so many words what they were taken as saying. You could spot the giveaway words. But the inference drawn was that this was another set of tests which the nation's primary school children would have to sit each year. \"Primary schools are to be given annual spelling tests set by the government as part of a new drive to improve children's literacy,\" in the words of the original article. I called the organisation in charge of school examinations earlier this week. When are these tests being introduced, I asked their spokesman. \"They're not,\" he said. \"But what about all those news-paper reports last December? You mean they were all balls?\" I asked. \"The words are yours,\" he replied. It's a small example, and I wasn't being entirely fair. If you read the original report closely, there was nothing actually inaccurate about it. It didn't say, in so many words, that there will be yet another set of national exams. What was really happening was that a booklet was being sent out to primary schools, with ideas for improving literacy, including suggestions about playing charades and the like. But the impression conveyed was another matter. It was, in other words, a story which was very effectively spun. It doesn't matter much. There are much worse things going on. In March this year, Panorama demonstrated devastatingly how the government plays fast and loose with facts in its attempts to persuade us of how brilliant it is. The programme revealed the ingenious technique of double- and treble-counting figures for investment in the National Health Service, which meant that \u00a310.3bn of additional investment suddenly becomes, hey presto, \u00a321bn. And there was the habit of announcing the same funding increase time and again. So an extra \u00a330m to modernise NHS accident and emergency services was announced not once but four times over several months, so that if you blinked, it looked like \u00a3120m. This wasn't anything as concrete as an actual lie. But it was distinctly fishy. Now, I don't blame the government propaganda machine for doing its job as well as it can. Its business is to make the government look good. The machine is now, in the hands of Alastair Campbell and the Downing Street strategic communications unit, more sophisticated than it has ever been. And you have to admire its brilliance. Damn, the thing's so accomplished that it's able to get newspapers reporting things which haven't been said. In January this year, the Times gave an account of a speech in which Tony Blair savaged Ken Livingstone, when the reality was that the reported remarks were never made. The newspaper was going on a press release handed out before the speech was delivered: when it came to the event itself, confronted by irritable Livingstone supporters, Blair dropped the remarks that had been included in the pre-released version of his speech. I am sure this was just a genuine mistake, but it is symptomatic of something. So, too, is the phenomenon of reporting things before they happen - as in David Blunkett's announcement of new primary school spelling tests. Poor old Matthew Parris, the Times columnist and former Conservative MP, woke up at 6.30am one Sunday in January to hear Radio 5 Live tell him what the prime minister was \"expected to say\" in a live interview with David Frost in a couple of hours' time. Call me old-fashioned, but I thought what someone said in an interview rather depended on what they were asked. Alastair Campbell, who is an honourable man, says this \"expected to say\" line did not come from him. In which case, where did it come from? On the morning in question, the prime minister's spokesman found himself, he said, in the bizarre position of explaining to a BBC journalist what the prime minister had said in the course of the interview. You might have thought that the journalist could have found out by watching the interview, and discovering whether indeed the prime minister had said what he was expected to say. The journalist explained to Campbell that she had been too busy talking about what the prime minister was \"expected\" to say on other BBC outlets to watch the interview itself. It's a mad world, my masters. But there's worse even than this example. On another occasion, also in January, Campbell found himself handing out copies of a prime ministerial speech to journalists. He reports one of them saying \"What should we say about it?\", to which he replied, not unreasonably, \"Read it\". Even this isn't the worst example that I've come across recently. On one Thursday afternoon last December, a senior member of the No 10 staff was in one of the House of Commons bars. He was approached by a Sunday newspaper journalist. \"Got anything for me?\" said the reporter. \"The story I have been working on has collapsed and the newsdesk is demanding a front-page splash.\" No, said the man from No 10, nothing much happening at all now. To which he got the jaw-dropping reply, \"I'll just have to make it up then\" - and unbelievably, he did. A story appeared which was a figment of the reporter's imagination. And, because it was printed on a Sunday morning, all the ministers appearing on all the Sunday political chat shows had to spend the day commenting on a policy that did not exist. I am told - on good authority from a member of the House of Commons lobby - that this sort of thing is not confined to newspapers published on Sundays which happen to fall on a February 29. Don't get me wrong, I am not seeking to run down my parliamentary colleagues, most of whom are doing their level best to discover reality in a hall of mirrors. Their job is made no easier by the fact that the marketplace has become so ruthlessly competitive. Something very odd has happened. Once upon a time, in the famous phrase Stanley Baldwin borrowed from Rudyard Kipling, what newspaper proprietors were seeking was power (and as he put it \"power without responsibility, the prerogative of the harlot throughout the ages\"). But nowadays, it increasingly seems to me that newspaper proprietors are a great deal less interested in power than they are in money. There is a simple rule we could apply here. It is this: good journalism is bad business and too often bad journalism is good business. Finding things out, as anyone who has done any investigative journalism knows, takes time, and time is money. Resources are now so stretched on some newsdesks that no one can spare the time to research a story properly. The consequence is that they are increasingly dependent on what they are told. And while demand has multiplied, supply is more or less static. One of the oddest manifestations of this tension is the fight to be first with the story. In a 24-hour news culture, what is the point of a newspaper telling you what you think you already know? That is the explanation for all the \"expected to say\" stories. It can mean that the actual announcement is scarcely covered before the caravan moves on to the next pre-emptive policy disclosure and another occasion for spin. In this world, if you keep moving fast enough the referee hasn't got time to see the dirty tackle. So, how do we survive spin? The first thing I think we could all usefully do is to stop whingeing about it. Spin-doctors and their pals are the inevitable accoutrements of democracy in a mass media age. They're on the other side of the fence, that's all. Our approach ought to be to continue doing what we should have been doing all along. It is our job to find out things that people do not want to have found out. But for journalists to function properly, they have to be given freedom and resources. And those will come only from organisations which believe that their first duty is disclosure, not entertainment. I suggest that it is a sound principle never to treat any comment from any spokesman for any vested interest with anything other than profound scepticism, never to ask for a story, but to find it out for yourself, and if you are ever given a story to ask first why you are being given it. There is nothing scientific about our trade. Nor, apart from a few basic tricks, can it really be taught. The great Sunday Times journalist Nicholas Tomalin once listed the three prerequisites for a journalist as being a plausible manner, a little literary ability and rat-like cunning. They remain as true as ever. But essentially journalism is a matter of instinct, the expression of primitive curiosity and an instinctive urge to cause trouble, to be difficult, coupled with an atavistic distrust of anyone in authority In the spin doctor's ideal world, all is managed, smoothed and predictable. In the journalist's ideal world, all is chaos and confusion. It is our duty to bite the hand that feeds us.

BSkyB was still haemorrhaging money, saddled with \u00a32bn of debt and doubts remained as to whether there was a genuine market for pay-television in Britain at all.

Sky saw off a complacent BBC and ITV and never looked back. </p> <p>In Mathew Horsman's history of the company, Sky High, former chief executive Sam Chisholm recalls that in the weeks before screening its first season of the Premier League it was \"like Christmas\" at its Isleworth HQ as subscriptions flooded in. </p> <p>Now fast-forward to early 2000. BSkyB directors begin wooing Ken Bates for a stake in Chelsea Football Club and can't fail to notice the new wealth at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground. The cluster of bars and restaurants built into the side of the football stadium are surely the best mock Victoriana that money can buy. </p> <p>BSkyB eventually paid \u00a340m for a 9.9% share. Privately, BSkyB insiders admit that Bates had been a demanding negotiator. \"It was like 'AND I want you to sponsor one of our new millennium boxes . . .'\" </p> <p>The Lazarus-like effect that football had on BSkyB's business has turned the game into a hugely valuable currency for broadcasters - a fact the club chairmen are only too well aware of. The meeting during which the tender document for the next set of broadcasting rights was presented to the 20 clubs last month lasted nine-and-a-half hours and descended into a screaming match between Bates and Tottenham chairman Alan Sugar. \"The clubs are the biggest bunch of avaricious bastards I've ever come across,\" said one media executive. </p> <p>Long gone are the days when the BBC and ITV ran a cosy cartel to keep the cost of broadcasting rights as low as possible and even threatened to walk away from the game. Their last joint contract in 1986 paid just \u00a36.2m for league coverage over two years. Under the current deal, hatched on the eve of Euro 96, BSkyB paid \u00a3670m for five years with the BBC winning a highlights package for \u00a373m. </p> <p>But the stakes are set to reach extraordinary new heights. On Wednesday, bids will be submitted for the next round of rights, set to run for three years from the 2001/2 sea son. Estimates are that the renewed price, which will be agreed in July, could go as high as \u00a32bn. </p> <p>The balance of power has tilted even further toward the clubs as BSkyB faces increasingly tough competition from a cable industry which has consolidated from eight players in 1996 to just two, a stronger ITV and OnDigital. A more aggressive Channel 4 and Channel 5 could both be in the running for highlights. </p> <p>There are several different packages on offer. The most attractive will give the winner the rights to 66 live games per season with matches to be shown on Sundays and Mondays. Another 40 matches will be on offer on a pay-per-view basis and there are two highlights packages which will result in more football on TV than ever before. </p> <p>Clubs will also be given rights to show matches on their own channels and the internet after they have been broadcast live. Bid documents from broadcasters could be as many as 100 pages long and media companies will have to give a number of assurances over how they plan to televise the game and their handling of the product overall. </p> <p>Football officials will look closely at the scheduling of games, the packaging of match coverage and ideas for the promotion of the sport. In total, 75 tender documents have been sent out and a number of bids have already been submitted to the Premier League's central London headquarters. </p> <p>BSkyB's acquisition of a stake in Chelsea has been read by many media pundits as a sign of its nervousness. According to research conducted for the then Monopoly and Mergers Commission at the time of BSkyB's failed \u00a3623m bid for Manchester United, around 37% of homes would reconsider their subscription to Sky Sports if it lost the Premier League. </p> <p>The company today has more than 4m subscribers to its own satellite service and another 5m watching Sky programming through cable or OnDigital. Around two-thirds take Sky Sports which, alongside movies, remains the linchpin for subscriptions. Doug Ellis, chairman of Aston Villa, comments: \"If Murdoch hadn't got Premiership football he wouldn't have a company today. BSkyB has almost entirely depended on screening live football. It is their bread and butter.\" </p> <p>Since its bid for Manchester United was blocked, BSkyB has taken stakes in Manchester City, Leeds and Sunderland as well as holding on to a 9.9% share of United. NTL, Britain's leading cable company, has pursued the same strategy by buying shares in Aston Villa, Newcastle United and Middlesbrough, while Granada owns 9.9% of Liverpool. </p> <p>As long as the investments don't go above 10%, a media company can hold as many stakes as it wants although the Premier League has hinted that six may be the limit. A league resolution could be blocked by seven clubs voting against it and concerns have already been raised at Premier League meetings that clubs will vote according to their media affiliations rather than for the overall good of the game. Moreover, anyone familiar with the history of the past two sets of rights negotiations will be aware that personal relationships carry a lot of weight. </p> <p>\"Of course we have to be aware of the media connection between clubs,\" one source said. \"It is something that could affect the outcome of any future television deal. But I would be very surprised if clubs voted as one media company bloc because a lot of questions would be asked, particularly from those clubs that do not have any interest from media companies.\" </p> <p>Still, the clubs acknowledge the debt they owe to BSkyB which is widely held to have played a key role in the rejuvenation of the game. In the 80s just seven live First Division games were screened a year, compared to 60 from the Premier League under the current deal. </p> <p>It is often forgotten that before the huge influx of cash from BSkyB, there were widespread fears of bankruptcy among clubs as the post-Hillsborough Taylor Report forced them into costly redevelopments of their stadia into all-seaters. </p> <p>BSkyB will also be keen to stress recent innovations such as its interactive service where viewers can chose camera angles and watch replays at will. But loyalty is unlikely to weigh too heavily against the lure of pound signs. </p> <p>Newcastle chairman Freddie Fletcher recalls the days before Sky Sports: \"I remember trying to sell a game to ITV when they had the contract and they would say no because Coronation Street was on. Sky has made an enormous difference and have done an excellent job in marketing and building up the game but that is not to say that someone else might not come along and do even better.\" </p> <p>Whichever company wins the main live rights, it will probably be forced to make them available to other platforms, just as Sky Sports is made available to OnDigital and cable. But control over production would put the winner on the map and have other knock-on benefits, particularly when selling add-on premium channels. </p> <p>In the 1996 rights auction BSkyB faced two rival bids. The first from Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media which owns the Express newspapers and the Anglia, Meridian and HTV franchises. The second was a joint venture between the then Mirror Group and Carlton Communications.Both effectively outbid BSkyB, but there was an unquantifiable profit-sharing element to both. They were rejected in favour of Murdoch's hard cash and the fact that, at the time, BSkyB was the only bidder with an existing platform to distribute pay-TV. </p> <p>Hollick at least has made it clear he intends to be among the contenders again. \"We were an underbidder last time and would expect to bid, with partners, for some or all of the rights,\" he recently said. </p> <p>This time around Carlton has an established pay-TV platform through its OnDigital joint venture with Granada and the ITV companies could make a powerful bid, dividing up the live and highlights packages between them. OnDigital recently set up its own sports channel and its appetite for football was demonstrated by the \u00a375m acquisition of rights to screen the European Champions League over three years. OnDigital's broadcasting director Graham Stanley says talks have already begun with the Premier League and describes the forthcoming negotiations as \"highly charged and highly complex\". </p> <p>There has been speculation that an investment bank or two may also be considering a bid and then acting as broker, or as a backer for the League to set up its own pay-TV service. Even Channel 5, which has found football a useful ratings booster, is watching closely. The BBC has long resigned itself to the idea that live rights are now well beyond its ambit. </p> <p>The main rival to BSkyB is viewed by many as NTL, Britain's biggest cable company, fuelled by cash from investors including Microsoft and France Telecom. Chief executive Barclay Knapp said the company, which owns British Eurosport, will \"be at the table\" but is reluctant to suggest it will slug it out with BSkyB for the key rights. Nor does he rule out an alliance with other broadcasters to share the rights. </p> <p>\"We heard there were a lot of shenanigans last time round,\" he says. \"We have to show up and see what happens. We've certainly got the money, the platform and the production muscle and so are a very credible bidder. But we are not going to pay any price. We are just about used to the current economic state of play with Sky Sports and are not going to get involved in an epic struggle.\" </p> <p>Once the deadline is passed, Premier League officials led by chief executive Richard Scudamore will effectively go into purdah to discuss the merits of each bid. This process is expected to take at least two weeks, with media advisers and lawyers working closely with the league to choose which they consider to be the best in terms of price and marketing. </p> <p> It is still not clear what form the next stage of the bidding process will take - the most crucial phase comprising the group of final contenders. League officials are still deciding whether the second and final round of bidding should involve sealed bids or an open auction, with the relevant rights going to the highest bidder. It hopes to reach a decision by July but has set a backstop deadline of the start of the next season. </p> <p>BSkyB is widely expected to retain the core 66-game package. Tellingly, though, the Premier League has reduced the length of the contract from five to three years, conscious of the fact that by 2003 the broadcasting landscape could look very different once again. </p> <p>There is every possibility that by then the cable industry will have consolidated to one player and legislation will have cleared the way for a single ITV company, providing even more serious competition to BSkyB and potentially driving the cost of rights higher once again. Knapp certainly appears to be a man biding his time. If he fails to win a significant chunk of rights this time he will, he says, simply \"reload\" and focus on the next set.</p>",

Estimates are that the renewed price, which will be agreed in July, could go as high as \u00a32bn. The balance of power has tilted even further toward the clubs as BSkyB faces increasingly tough competition from a cable industry which has consolidated from eight players in 1996 to just two, a stronger ITV and OnDigital. A more aggressive Channel 4 and Channel 5 could both be in the running for highlights. There are several different packages on offer. The most attractive will give the winner the rights to 66 live games per season with matches to be shown on Sundays and Mondays. Another 40 matches will be on offer on a pay-per-view basis and there are two highlights packages which will result in more football on TV than ever before. Clubs will also be given rights to show matches on their own channels and the internet after they have been broadcast live. Bid documents from broadcasters could be as many as 100 pages long and media companies will have to give a number of assurances over how they plan to televise the game and their handling of the product overall. Football officials will look closely at the scheduling of games, the packaging of match coverage and ideas for the promotion of the sport. In total, 75 tender documents have been sent out and a number of bids have already been submitted to the Premier League's central London headquarters. BSkyB's acquisition of a stake in Chelsea has been read by many media pundits as a sign of its nervousness. According to research conducted for the then Monopoly and Mergers Commission at the time of BSkyB's failed \u00a3623m bid for Manchester United, around 37% of homes would reconsider their subscription to Sky Sports if it lost the Premier League. The company today has more than 4m subscribers to its own satellite service and another 5m watching Sky programming through cable or OnDigital. Around two-thirds take Sky Sports which, alongside movies, remains the linchpin for subscriptions. Doug Ellis, chairman of Aston Villa, comments: \"If Murdoch hadn't got Premiership football he wouldn't have a company today. BSkyB has almost entirely depended on screening live football. It is their bread and butter.\" Since its bid for Manchester United was blocked, BSkyB has taken stakes in Manchester City, Leeds and Sunderland as well as holding on to a 9.9% share of United. NTL, Britain's leading cable company, has pursued the same strategy by buying shares in Aston Villa, Newcastle United and Middlesbrough, while Granada owns 9.9% of Liverpool. As long as the investments don't go above 10%, a media company can hold as many stakes as it wants although the Premier League has hinted that six may be the limit. A league resolution could be blocked by seven clubs voting against it and concerns have already been raised at Premier League meetings that clubs will vote according to their media affiliations rather than for the overall good of the game. Moreover, anyone familiar with the history of the past two sets of rights negotiations will be aware that personal relationships carry a lot of weight. \"Of course we have to be aware of the media connection between clubs,\" one source said. \"It is something that could affect the outcome of any future television deal. But I would be very surprised if clubs voted as one media company bloc because a lot of questions would be asked, particularly from those clubs that do not have any interest from media companies.\" Still, the clubs acknowledge the debt they owe to BSkyB which is widely held to have played a key role in the rejuvenation of the game. In the 80s just seven live First Division games were screened a year, compared to 60 from the Premier League under the current deal. It is often forgotten that before the huge influx of cash from BSkyB, there were widespread fears of bankruptcy among clubs as the post-Hillsborough Taylor Report forced them into costly redevelopments of their stadia into all-seaters. BSkyB will also be keen to stress recent innovations such as its interactive service where viewers can chose camera angles and watch replays at will. But loyalty is unlikely to weigh too heavily against the lure of pound signs. Newcastle chairman Freddie Fletcher recalls the days before Sky Sports: \"I remember trying to sell a game to ITV when they had the contract and they would say no because Coronation Street was on. Sky has made an enormous difference and have done an excellent job in marketing and building up the game but that is not to say that someone else might not come along and do even better.\" Whichever company wins the main live rights, it will probably be forced to make them available to other platforms, just as Sky Sports is made available to OnDigital and cable. But control over production would put the winner on the map and have other knock-on benefits, particularly when selling add-on premium channels. In the 1996 rights auction BSkyB faced two rival bids. The first from Lord Hollick's United News &amp; Media which owns the Express newspapers and the Anglia, Meridian and HTV franchises. The second was a joint venture between the then Mirror Group and Carlton Communications.Both effectively outbid BSkyB, but there was an unquantifiable profit-sharing element to both. They were rejected in favour of Murdoch's hard cash and the fact that, at the time, BSkyB was the only bidder with an existing platform to distribute pay-TV. Hollick at least has made it clear he intends to be among the contenders again. \"We were an underbidder last time and would expect to bid, with partners, for some or all of the rights,\" he recently said. This time around Carlton has an established pay-TV platform through its OnDigital joint venture with Granada and the ITV companies could make a powerful bid, dividing up the live and highlights packages between them. OnDigital recently set up its own sports channel and its appetite for football was demonstrated by the \u00a375m acquisition of rights to screen the European Champions League over three years. OnDigital's broadcasting director Graham Stanley says talks have already begun with the Premier League and describes the forthcoming negotiations as \"highly charged and highly complex\". There has been speculation that an investment bank or two may also be considering a bid and then acting as broker, or as a backer for the League to set up its own pay-TV service. Even Channel 5, which has found football a useful ratings booster, is watching closely. The BBC has long resigned itself to the idea that live rights are now well beyond its ambit. The main rival to BSkyB is viewed by many as NTL, Britain's biggest cable company, fuelled by cash from investors including Microsoft and France Telecom. Chief executive Barclay Knapp said the company, which owns British Eurosport, will \"be at the table\" but is reluctant to suggest it will slug it out with BSkyB for the key rights. Nor does he rule out an alliance with other broadcasters to share the rights. \"We heard there were a lot of shenanigans last time round,\" he says. \"We have to show up and see what happens. We've certainly got the money, the platform and the production muscle and so are a very credible bidder. But we are not going to pay any price. We are just about used to the current economic state of play with Sky Sports and are not going to get involved in an epic struggle.\" Once the deadline is passed, Premier League officials led by chief executive Richard Scudamore will effectively go into purdah to discuss the merits of each bid. This process is expected to take at least two weeks, with media advisers and lawyers working closely with the league to choose which they consider to be the best in terms of price and marketing. It is still not clear what form the next stage of the bidding process will take - the most crucial phase comprising the group of final contenders. League officials are still deciding whether the second and final round of bidding should involve sealed bids or an open auction, with the relevant rights going to the highest bidder. It hopes to reach a decision by July but has set a backstop deadline of the start of the next season. BSkyB is widely expected to retain the core 66-game package. Tellingly, though, the Premier League has reduced the length of the contract from five to three years, conscious of the fact that by 2003 the broadcasting landscape could look very different once again. There is every possibility that by then the cable industry will have consolidated to one player and legislation will have cleared the way for a single ITV company, providing even more serious competition to BSkyB and potentially driving the cost of rights higher once again. Knapp certainly appears to be a man biding his time. If he fails to win a significant chunk of rights this time he will, he says, simply \"reload\" and focus on the next set.",

Name a handful of well-known documentary film-makers - Errol Morris, Paul Watson, Nick Broomfield, Fred Wiseman - and you will struggle to find a common method in their gathering and assembling of reality. Documentary truth shouldn't be confused with literalism, but by rushing to condemn Savage and, by implication claiming public vindication for their own work, programme-makers allowed the debate to descend into banalities. The line defining what is and is not acceptable television was being drawn by the tabloid press. </p> <p>But while the reaction was undoubtedly over the top, Savage was not blameless. Because the men in Rogue Males were constantly on the lookout for a scam, he felt that there was a natural blurring of fact and fiction taking place, and that the film reflected that. Where he went wrong was to lose his own sense of what was real and what was not: \"At times he was too vague about what had actually happened,\" a Channel 4 insider told me. \"Taking a post-modernist view is all very well, but you have to remember why you are there with a camera in the first place.\" </p> <p>When we meet, Savage accepts that in retrospect he could have been more explicit: \"Given that I thought it was important to see those people engaged in these activities, maybe it should have been signposted better. Perhaps the whole thing should have been more dramatic.\" </p> <p>He remains adamant, however, that the film was a truthful interpretation of a particular way of life, \"There is nothing in me that wants to fabricate, or lie, or make things up. I suppose some people could say I was naive, but I think naivety is an important characteristic of a documentarist, and I've always enjoyed the process of discovery while making a film.\" </p> <p>He bears no ill will to Allan Birkin, the rogue male who sold his story to the Mirror: \"People in that situation will do anything for a few bob, and to further themselves,\" he smiles, \"so maybe you just shouldn't make contentious films about people who might let you down.\" </p> <p>It was the reaction of his peers which stung him: \"How can you take a moralist, purist stance? If you felt that strongly about it you wouldn't do it at all, you wouldn't take real people and put their lives on screen, you would just be their friend or something. At times it did feel like I was the sacrificial lamb.\" </p> <p>He also thinks that Channel 4 could have handled things better: \"There were lots of divisions. The commissioning editor, Charles Furneaux, was very supportive, but perhaps if there had been a bolder, more united response, it might have gone away. Certainly the apology didn't help matters.\" </p> <p>The apology was issued by the then recently appointed head of factual programmes, Steve Hewlett. Straight from the BBC, Hewlett felt that an apology sent a clear signal about the new regime and would draw a line under all the fuss. One source suggested to me that Hewlett had done his best, while Michael Jackson didn't take it very seriously to begin with and then didn't have a clue how to handle it. (After the channel was fined \u00a310,000 for inaccuracies in the rent-boy film, Chickens, a fellow executive asked Jackson how much he thought Rogue Males would have cost in a similar action, \"Ten quid,\" was his reply.) </p> <p>Jackson may have considered the allegations against Rogue Males to be largely spurious (a position with which others privately concur), but the intense press scrutiny did cause many film-makers to reassess their position. The downside was the assumption that authorship was the problem, that somehow the popular docu-soaps were more realistic simply because they didn't take a point of view. More positively, many film-makers chose to hold the debate on camera, making themselves and their interventions obvious to the audience. </p> <p>For those interested in the point at which fact becomes fiction, drama or docu-drama seemed an appropriate arena in which to continue their explorations. The results have been mixed. Losing no opportunity to gain ground over his arch-rivals on Cutting Edge, Stephen Lambert, then editor of BBC2's Modern Times, announced that the much-admired documentarist Paul Pawlikowski, best known for the sublime Tripping With Zhirinovsky, would be taking on the challenge to try something truly different in Twockers, a film based on the lives of juvenile car thieves. </p> <p>But Pawlikowski appeared trapped within the newly drawn boundaries, and the film, though nicely directed and acted, had none of the urgency or relevance a documentary might have managed, and lacked the power of a well-written fiction. </p> <p> If Penny Woolcock's Tina Goes Shopping was more successful dramatically, it also underlined the confusion that labelling such a film can still create. Funded by the documentary department, Tina was a drama created from a documentary imperative, and although Channel 4 went to great pains to explain the process at work, the explanation seems to have left some of the audience behind. Subsequent viewer complaints over a scene depicting the domestic slaughter of a cow highlighted the problem. </p> <p>Commissioning editor Peter Dale denies that there was any confusion, adding: \"I think that what is important is to be absolutely clear to the audience what they can expect to see. This format is possibly the only way to show the lives of people on the margins of our society.\" </p> <p>It seems a wise move on Savage's part, then, to be as upfront about his methods and intentions in Nice Girl, the story of a Welsh teenager pregnant and married (like her mother and sister) before turning 16, which was co-funded by the BBC's drama and documentaries departments. \"When we started we didn't really know what route we were going to take,\" he explains. \"I didn't know if I would use real people, playing themselves, but it became clear that that was inappropriate and wouldn't have worked.\" An amalgamation of two real stories, Nice Girl features newly trained actors in an improvised script, written as they went along. Most reminiscent of Ken Loach's Cathy Come Home, the film falls down, ironically enough, at the points where Savage tries too hard to convince us that this is real. </p> <p>He is aware of the problem: \"I tried it, and next time I would do things differently - make sure that certain things that need to be said are scripted. One shouldn't stick too hard to a doctrine, you should do whatever feels right at the time, and there are things in documentary which I might once have tried but wouldn't do now.\" </p> <p>Nice Girl: BBC2 Thursday 11 at 9pm</p>",

If you felt that strongly about it you wouldn't do it at all, you wouldn't take real people and put their lives on screen, you would just be their friend or something. At times it did feel like I was the sacrificial lamb.\" He also thinks that Channel 4 could have handled things better: \"There were lots of divisions. The commissioning editor, Charles Furneaux, was very supportive, but perhaps if there had been a bolder, more united response, it might have gone away. Certainly the apology didn't help matters.\" The apology was issued by the then recently appointed head of factual programmes, Steve Hewlett. Straight from the BBC, Hewlett felt that an apology sent a clear signal about the new regime and would draw a line under all the fuss. One source suggested to me that Hewlett had done his best, while Michael Jackson didn't take it very seriously to begin with and then didn't have a clue how to handle it. (After the channel was fined \u00a310,000 for inaccuracies in the rent-boy film, Chickens, a fellow executive asked Jackson how much he thought Rogue Males would have cost in a similar action, \"Ten quid,\" was his reply.) Jackson may have considered the allegations against Rogue Males to be largely spurious (a position with which others privately concur), but the intense press scrutiny did cause many film-makers to reassess their position. The downside was the assumption that authorship was the problem, that somehow the popular docu-soaps were more realistic simply because they didn't take a point of view. More positively, many film-makers chose to hold the debate on camera, making themselves and their interventions obvious to the audience. For those interested in the point at which fact becomes fiction, drama or docu-drama seemed an appropriate arena in which to continue their explorations. The results have been mixed. Losing no opportunity to gain ground over his arch-rivals on Cutting Edge, Stephen Lambert, then editor of BBC2's Modern Times, announced that the much-admired documentarist Paul Pawlikowski, best known for the sublime Tripping With Zhirinovsky, would be taking on the challenge to try something truly different in Twockers, a film based on the lives of juvenile car thieves. But Pawlikowski appeared trapped within the newly drawn boundaries, and the film, though nicely directed and acted, had none of the urgency or relevance a documentary might have managed, and lacked the power of a well-written fiction. If Penny Woolcock's Tina Goes Shopping was more successful dramatically, it also underlined the confusion that labelling such a film can still create. Funded by the documentary department, Tina was a drama created from a documentary imperative, and although Channel 4 went to great pains to explain the process at work, the explanation seems to have left some of the audience behind. Subsequent viewer complaints over a scene depicting the domestic slaughter of a cow highlighted the problem. Commissioning editor Peter Dale denies that there was any confusion, adding: \"I think that what is important is to be absolutely clear to the audience what they can expect to see. This format is possibly the only way to show the lives of people on the margins of our society.\" It seems a wise move on Savage's part, then, to be as upfront about his methods and intentions in Nice Girl, the story of a Welsh teenager pregnant and married (like her mother and sister) before turning 16, which was co-funded by the BBC's drama and documentaries departments. \"When we started we didn't really know what route we were going to take,\" he explains. \"I didn't know if I would use real people, playing themselves, but it became clear that that was inappropriate and wouldn't have worked.\" An amalgamation of two real stories, Nice Girl features newly trained actors in an improvised script, written as they went along. Most reminiscent of Ken Loach's Cathy Come Home, the film falls down, ironically enough, at the points where Savage tries too hard to convince us that this is real. He is aware of the problem: \"I tried it, and next time I would do things differently - make sure that certain things that need to be said are scripted. One shouldn't stick too hard to a doctrine, you should do whatever feels right at the time, and there are things in documentary which I might once have tried but wouldn't do now.\" Nice Girl: BBC2 Thursday 11 at 9pm",

As a fan and a reader, you want your hero to be genuinely inspirational. As a journalist, you hope for lunacy, spite, deplorable indiscretions. </p> <p>That, as it happens, is not me on Amis: it's Amis on Bellow. But he is right. You read the book, you enjoy it. Then you go along intent on teasing out all the deplorable indiscretions that you feel are so regrettably missing from the text. \"You write with commendable restraint about your rift with Julian Barnes . . . perhaps you could - in the relaxed ambience of your sitting room over this agreeable glass of Chardonnay - just tell me what you really feel?\" </p> <p>But two things intervene: one is that Amis is a very practised interviewee. Indeed, he's regularly been at both ends of the microphone over the years and, under questioning, is remarkably disciplined. Time and again he refers you to what he says in his book. And you have to sympathise with that. The stuff about the falling-out with Barnes is there in this new book of his: it is taut, deliberate and precise. Why muddy it with a casual aside? And the other thing is that Amis appears, at this stage of his life (or maybe it was just the day I caught him), remarkably mellow and un-spite-filled. There are pushchairs by the garden gate of his handsome north London house. The interview is punctuated by the counterpoint of child and baby sounds from the kitchen. </p> <p>And that mellowness seems to inform this latest book, his autobiography, or memoir, Experience. \"When I sat down to write it, I thought that scores would be settled - that that would inevitably be part of it,\" he says. \"And when I finished the book, I realised how little of that there had been. And I was surprised at how little I enjoyed the short passages where I do settle a score. There are only two or three of them, perhaps.\" </p> <p>And it's true. There is a short, brutal lunge at the writer James Buchan (\"a humourless worthy\") over a review of Time's Arrow which accused Amis of writing about Auschwitz for \"profit\". There is the settling of accounts, if not scores, with Barnes. There is some fun at the expense of Eric Jacobs, aka the Biographer. And there is a sharp kick on the shins for his former agent Gillon Aitken. And that is about it on the spite front. </p> <p>We meet at his home - not quite Camden, not quite St John's Wood, and, pace the fourth estate, certainly not Manhattan. He is just off a plane from Los Angeles, where he has been a) at a literary conference, and b) researching the Californian porn industry. His inquiries in relation to the latter were thorough enough to have included an encounter with an ageing pornographer who specialised in videos devoted to anal sex - \"the arse man of the millennium\". </p> <p>He draws on a thin cigarette and tackles the question of why, at 50, he should have turned to autobiography. \"I think I always unconsciously knew that I would have to write about my father simply because of the rarity of our case.\" But it is not simply a book about his father? \"It feels like a book about my father. I felt it come upon me after he died, perhaps in the year between his death and the memorial service. A great deal of energy went into just formalising that, and not much work was possible. But I was thinking in the back of my mind, 'Well, now's the time to begin this.'\" </p> <p>The result is, he says, his life \"to the best of my recollection\", which did not prove infallible. \"I thought I had a good memory, but I've already been corrected on a couple of things. One little thing, one really rather serious case of false memory - it was not that I invented anything, but I kind of transposed two events in time. I'm not going to say what they are, but I didn't feel I could change it at proof level. I thought, 'I'll print it and, you know, if there are consequences I'll take them, and then I'll perhaps in future editions add a footnote saying, 'I've got this wrong and it's the other way round.' You trust to the integrity of your memory and then you check the details as much as you can. But I thought I had a very good memory and have now begun to doubt that a bit.\" </p> <p>He has never resorted to psychoanalysis and never would. \"Certainly not. I would fear that as a magician would fear showing his tricks. Since, as a writer, you're totally dependent on your unconscious, I wouldn't want anyone going in there.\" </p> <p>His father, in an attempt to overcome his phobias, had tried analysis. \"The psychiatrist after a couple of sessions said, 'You know, the reason that you can't go on an underground platform is that you were an only child and you feared another child appearing in your mother's tunnel.' And Kingsley thought, 'Well, I may be a bit neurotic, but I'm not that daft.'\" </p> <p>The Amis story - senior and junior - is familiar enough to even the casual reader of the mid-market and broadsheet press. The Amis marriages, the Amis divorces, the Amis (senior) m\u00e9nage, the Amis (junior) dentistry: \"the usual stuff\", as Amis calls it. And that very familiarity is, he says, part of the point of wanting to write the story himself - to reclaim it from the unauthorised version that is out there. </p> <p>\"It's already public, so much of it, but distorted from all kinds of crazy angles. So that was definitely another attraction: to think that this will be the version that lasts longer than yesterday's Daily Mail, or whatever it might be.\" Nevertheless, there are things missing from the book that were not missing from the Daily Mail version. He writes briefly about the pain of his own collapsed first marriage, but none of the accompanying circumstances. \"I thought I wouldn't do that, because I know my first wife wouldn't want me to; and also, for that reason, I didn't want to either. It wasn't that I was suppressing it. I did try to give appropriate weight to what a dreadful failure that was for me. </p> <p>\"The key to it all was that I remember saying to myself when my parents broke up, 'I'm never going to get divorced, I'm absolutely not going to do it.' So it's a sort of lifelong defeat, whose essence is really that you're doing to your children what was done to you. You are, perhaps, weakening their capacity for love, and that's a solemn and a sombre matter.\" </p> <p>The desire to recover some measure of control over his own life story also explains why a dentist should play an improbably prominent role in the book. This is not a book for anyone with a fear of the chair or the drill. There are tooth-by-tooth, month-by-month descriptions of painful progress with syringe, saw and pliers on jaw, gum and teeth. </p> <p>This may not fall into the explicit category of score-settling, but nor is it there by accident. Casual Amisites will know the saga: Amis Jnr sacks agent (Pat Kavanagh, wife of Julian Barnes) in order to plunder huge advance so as to pay for cosmetic work on molars to accompany mid-life crisis and new wife. No one reading this book will believe that any longer. Ask him if there is too much on the teeth in the book and the mellow mood is almost punctured: \"I would have failed entirely in my purposes if there hadn't been too much on teeth. In one of those soul-searching media pieces at the time, I remember Mark Lawson saying, 'There has been a lot written about his teeth, and maybe we should have been told more about the teeth to make sure we got that right.' And I would like to say to Mark, 'Here's more about the teeth, and perhaps you can now see that it wasn't your business.' Tell my dentist that it was cosmetic.\" </p> <p>Which does leave the question of the reportedly huge advance, even if it wasn't going on cosmetic dentistry. Was money the sole cause of the split with Kavanagh which led to the severing of the Amis-Barnes friendship? \"Well, I mean, Pat was and is a first rate agent, but it - no, I wouldn't say it was money. It got out of control, that whole negotiation, and I sort of wondered why it had got out of control. That might have been the one time in my life where I thought I wanted to see what I was worth, in the middle of other crises. But it was being said that I was holding out in this megalomaniacal fashion for the chimerical half a million pounds. But how can a writer hold out for that? You can't force the issue, but that's how it was being presented, and to such an extent that I felt my only way of surviving it was to jump ship.\" </p> <p> Is this really plausible? To pretend it was not ultimately about money seems far-fetched. Amis counters that Wylie sorted out his foreign rights - not handled by Pat Kavanagh and in a mess. But he adds: \"What I care about is literary durability. That is all that matters to me, and I'm just happy enough when I have an advance of \u00a3250. My father felt that way, too - that such rewards as you got were pleasant but it wouldn't change you, and, even if your books were turned down for publication, you would go on.\" </p> <p>He pauses: \"How long one would go on remained the great question.\" </p> <p>And is he still on non-speaking terms with Barnes? \"No. When we meet, we chat, yes. You know, it's not what it was, but it's . . .\" </p> <p>How does he think the book will be received? \"I should think it will be what has come to be the usual rather violent 50-50. Maybe it will creep up to 60-40 because this is not a novel. Candour has its own dignity in a way.\" </p> <p>Which leads us to the toughest question - asked, he says, by all interviewers: why don't we like Martin Amis? In the book, he says: \"This wasn't a story about me. It was a story about England.\" Meaning? \"I don't get this treatment anywhere else, and that seems to me a sort of ipso facto proof that these are English traits we're talking about, and that's certainly how it felt. I mean, I felt - I sort of reeled back from it when it really exploded in the early 90s. You can say what you like about the English, but they can still surprise you, and I felt profoundly surprised.\" </p> <p>If what he's talking about is a brand of Philistinism, then one would expect other English writers to cop it. \"The only one who gets the same treatment, and gets 10 times the same treatment, is Salman Rushdie. With me, it's also Kingsley. I used to flatter myself by thinking it was something to do with my fictional prose. I thought my prose put people on their mettle and made them rivalrous and defensive, as if they see themselves stepping into a novel of mine and getting the treatment or something. But it must be much simpler than that, and the only thing that makes sense is that I'm like the son of the lord of the manor, in that I took over the estate or the pub by right of birth, whereas everyone else has had to struggle.\" </p> <p>In his autobiography, he argues that critics - and other journalists - have it in for writers, because they are competing in the same form. \"When you write about a novelist, an exponent of prose narrative, then you write a prose narrative. And what was the extent of your hopes for your prose - bookchat, interviews, gossip. Valued reader, it is not for me to say this is envy. It is for you to say that this is envy.\" </p> <p>The Unauthorised Version of the Amis saga has Jnr mortally upset at the persistent gibes from Snr over his literary talent and \"fucking fool\" politics. Again, not so, according to Jnr. \"The fact that he didn't always like my stuff didn't really bother me that much, because his taste in prose was so eccentric. I once asked him to name the prose writers he liked and, after Powell and perhaps a little of Henry Fielding, he was reduced to Dick Francis.\" </p> <p>Kingsley Amis did not read the novel his son dedicated to him, London Fields - \"he said he couldn't get on with it but he did read Time's Arrow in a single sitting and was very nice about it to me. But in general, he thought my stuff sniffed of the lamp.\" He was, maintains his son, \"a much sweeter man than his public persona, and I think that in getting that across I can also deal with those times when he was ornery.\" </p> <p>The father-son-ness at the heart of the book has not led him to thinking too deeply about questions of heredity, which, like Freudian theory, he considers over-scientistic. \"There is a difference between me and my father - and that difference is my mother. I do feel stirring in me what was towards the end very evident in him, which is what Edward Upward has called 'failures of tolerance'. Giving in to failures of tolerance was certainly a flaw of his, and I'm on the lookout for it in myself. </p> <p>\"It's not only in positive ways that your parents teach you how to live: they give the occasional negative examples as well. But, funnily enough, he did a pretty good job of raising his [family]. It's not every man whose three children are around him when he dies in the spirit that we were around him.\" But all this concentration on his relationship with his father has, he says, given him an appetite for the autobiographical. \"I obviously did not get enough memoir out of me because I'm writing another memoir at the moment, which is political. So there are reminiscences about Kingsley, you know, once a communist, later a quote, unquote 'fascist' - the fascist lunches and all that. And then my two great friends, James Fenton and Christopher Hitchens, being Trotskyists. So, there's more to come, and perhaps I'm slightly addicted to the form.\" </p> <p>For now, he has never felt better. \"Finishing The Information was tremendously difficult because I felt so physically awful when my marriage was breaking up, and it is interesting how physical it is. Guilt is not just an intellectual difficulty, it affects the whole body, guilt and remorse. I've never felt keener to get to my study than I am now.\" </p> <p>Has fatherhood second (or, on some accounting, third) time round - his two sons followed by three daughters (one entering his life nearly 20 years after her birth) - altered his views on feminism? \"No. I wrote a piece about Gloria Steinem in 1984 or so, and she actually converted me because her arguments are irresistible.\" </p> <p>But the Unauthorised Version has him down as the patron saint of Lads' Lit. \"What is this lads stuff?\" he asks. \"There was a lecture at this conference called Lads' Lit, and it traced the line between between Kingsley and me and Nick Hornby, but I don't think even Nick Hornby is laddish really. I mean lads don't write novels. They're down the pub. Being a writer means that you spent at least half your life by yourself; that's the defining thing. A lad is not a lad by himself, he's only a lad when he's with the lads. You can't walk around in your own house being a lad, can you? It's a communal activity.\" </p> <p>And with that there is a cry from the kitchen and Amis Jnr - non-lad, new lad, new Amis, whatever - announces that he must go and play his part. </p> <p> In G2 from tomorrow: exclusive extracts from Experience</p>",

My father felt that way, too - that such rewards as you got were pleasant but it wouldn't change you, and, even if your books were turned down for publication, you would go on.\" He pauses: \"How long one would go on remained the great question.\" And is he still on non-speaking terms with Barnes? \"No. When we meet, we chat, yes. You know, it's not what it was, but it's . . .\" How does he think the book will be received? \"I should think it will be what has come to be the usual rather violent 50-50. Maybe it will creep up to 60-40 because this is not a novel. Candour has its own dignity in a way.\" Which leads us to the toughest question - asked, he says, by all interviewers: why don't we like Martin Amis? In the book, he says: \"This wasn't a story about me. It was a story about England.\" Meaning? \"I don't get this treatment anywhere else, and that seems to me a sort of ipso facto proof that these are English traits we're talking about, and that's certainly how it felt. I mean, I felt - I sort of reeled back from it when it really exploded in the early 90s. You can say what you like about the English, but they can still surprise you, and I felt profoundly surprised.\" If what he's talking about is a brand of Philistinism, then one would expect other English writers to cop it. \"The only one who gets the same treatment, and gets 10 times the same treatment, is Salman Rushdie. With me, it's also Kingsley. I used to flatter myself by thinking it was something to do with my fictional prose. I thought my prose put people on their mettle and made them rivalrous and defensive, as if they see themselves stepping into a novel of mine and getting the treatment or something. But it must be much simpler than that, and the only thing that makes sense is that I'm like the son of the lord of the manor, in that I took over the estate or the pub by right of birth, whereas everyone else has had to struggle.\" In his autobiography, he argues that critics - and other journalists - have it in for writers, because they are competing in the same form. \"When you write about a novelist, an exponent of prose narrative, then you write a prose narrative. And what was the extent of your hopes for your prose - bookchat, interviews, gossip. Valued reader, it is not for me to say this is envy. It is for you to say that this is envy.\" The Unauthorised Version of the Amis saga has Jnr mortally upset at the persistent gibes from Snr over his literary talent and \"fucking fool\" politics. Again, not so, according to Jnr. \"The fact that he didn't always like my stuff didn't really bother me that much, because his taste in prose was so eccentric. I once asked him to name the prose writers he liked and, after Powell and perhaps a little of Henry Fielding, he was reduced to Dick Francis.\" Kingsley Amis did not read the novel his son dedicated to him, London Fields - \"he said he couldn't get on with it but he did read Time's Arrow in a single sitting and was very nice about it to me. But in general, he thought my stuff sniffed of the lamp.\" He was, maintains his son, \"a much sweeter man than his public persona, and I think that in getting that across I can also deal with those times when he was ornery.\" The father-son-ness at the heart of the book has not led him to thinking too deeply about questions of heredity, which, like Freudian theory, he considers over-scientistic. \"There is a difference between me and my father - and that difference is my mother. I do feel stirring in me what was towards the end very evident in him, which is what Edward Upward has called 'failures of tolerance'. Giving in to failures of tolerance was certainly a flaw of his, and I'm on the lookout for it in myself. \"It's not only in positive ways that your parents teach you how to live: they give the occasional negative examples as well. But, funnily enough, he did a pretty good job of raising his [family]. It's not every man whose three children are around him when he dies in the spirit that we were around him.\" But all this concentration on his relationship with his father has, he says, given him an appetite for the autobiographical. \"I obviously did not get enough memoir out of me because I'm writing another memoir at the moment, which is political. So there are reminiscences about Kingsley, you know, once a communist, later a quote, unquote 'fascist' - the fascist lunches and all that. And then my two great friends, James Fenton and Christopher Hitchens, being Trotskyists. So, there's more to come, and perhaps I'm slightly addicted to the form.\" For now, he has never felt better. \"Finishing The Information was tremendously difficult because I felt so physically awful when my marriage was breaking up, and it is interesting how physical it is. Guilt is not just an intellectual difficulty, it affects the whole body, guilt and remorse. I've never felt keener to get to my study than I am now.\" Has fatherhood second (or, on some accounting, third) time round - his two sons followed by three daughters (one entering his life nearly 20 years after her birth) - altered his views on feminism? \"No. I wrote a piece about Gloria Steinem in 1984 or so, and she actually converted me because her arguments are irresistible.\" But the Unauthorised Version has him down as the patron saint of Lads' Lit. \"What is this lads stuff?\" he asks. \"There was a lecture at this conference called Lads' Lit, and it traced the line between between Kingsley and me and Nick Hornby, but I don't think even Nick Hornby is laddish really. I mean lads don't write novels. They're down the pub. Being a writer means that you spent at least half your life by yourself; that's the defining thing. A lad is not a lad by himself, he's only a lad when he's with the lads. You can't walk around in your own house being a lad, can you? It's a communal activity.\" And with that there is a cry from the kitchen and Amis Jnr - non-lad, new lad, new Amis, whatever - announces that he must go and play his part.

      "body": "<p>British paratroopers arrived in Senegal today preparing to evacuate British citizens from neighbouring Sierra Leone as rebel fighters threatened to undermine a fragile peace accord with the government.</p> <p>Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, said he was deploying 700 to 800 personnel to the region. A British advance party is believed to be already in Sierra Leone as troops and Royal Navy warships assemble in the region. Mr Hoon said the substantial force was necessary because of the confused and volatile situation in the West African country.</p> <p>\"We have to make sure that they have the resources to protect themselves, as well as those they are seeking to evacuate,\" he said. He did not explicitly rule out the involvement of British troops in military action to support UN peacekeepers overseeing the deal brokered last July.</p> <p>Thousands of Sierra Leoneans gathered in the streets of Freetown today, calling for peace and denouncing the rebel Revolutionary United Front. Demonstrators converged on the city's main sports stadium in preparation for a rally to demand that the RUF and rebel leader Foday Sankoh release hundreds of UN staff they have been holding captive for the past week.</p> <p>\"We are on the streets today to show the world that Foday Sankoh is nobody but a monster who wants to kill the people of Sierra Leone,\" said Abubakarr Sillah, one of the demonstrators.</p> <p>The Foreign Office urged British nationals to leave Sierra Leone, after the rebels took hostage at least 300 UN peacekeepers and started marching on the capital, Freetown. Another 200 UN peacekeepers are missing in the interior of the country. One of those abducted is a British military observer who had been working with the UN.</p> <p>The first flight of British troops arrived in Senegal early today. The frigate Chatham, the helicopter carrier Ocean and three support ships are due to arrive off the West African coast in the next few days.</p> <p>Mr Hoon said the troops would be in place \"very quickly\" should the situation deteriorate and would remain for \"as long as it takes to secure the situation and allow British nationals to leave safely\". Five hundred British nationals are estimated to be in Sierra Leone. British military advisers flew into Sierra Leone at the weekend to advise the UN, whose peacekeeping operation is in danger of unravelling. Around a dozen men will be based in Freetown, where they will assess the technical support needed to enhance the effectiveness of the UN force of 8,000. The British team, drawn from all three armed services, was put together in response to a call for reinforcements from UN secretary-general Kofi Annan. Britain's shadow defence secretary Iain Duncan Smith said it was vital for British troops to be kept to a limited and precisely defined mission to aid British nationals, rather than becoming embroiled in the chaos of Sierra Leone's civil conflict.</p> <p>\"The concern I would have is that it is clear in their mandate that they are there to get the British nationals out, but not to get sucked into a civil war,\" he said. \"In these sorts of circumstances, once they are deployed, you don't want them hanging around for any great period of time. Otherwise, what happens very quickly is that they get sucked into that deteriorating situation and will need heavier and heavier equipment and firepower to secure their position.\"</p> <p>The much-criticised peace deal brokered by the UN last July was supposed to end one of the most vicious civil wars in Africa during which RUF rebels mutilated and tortured civilians as part of their terror campaign. RUF leader Foday Sankoh was brought into the government as vice-president and his supporters were supposed to give up their arms. But disputes have arisen over power and control of territory, particularly diamond-producing areas.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.sierra-leone.org\" target=\"_new\">Sierra Leone Web</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,218607,00.html\">Graphic: what's happening</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "British paratroopers arrived in Senegal today preparing to evacuate British citizens from neighbouring Sierra Leone as rebel fighters threatened to undermine a fragile peace accord with the government. Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, said he was deploying 700 to 800 personnel to the region. A British advance party is believed to be already in Sierra Leone as troops and Royal Navy warships assemble in the region. Mr Hoon said the substantial force was necessary because of the confused and volatile situation in the West African country. \"We have to make sure that they have the resources to protect themselves, as well as those they are seeking to evacuate,\" he said. He did not explicitly rule out the involvement of British troops in military action to support UN peacekeepers overseeing the deal brokered last July. Thousands of Sierra Leoneans gathered in the streets of Freetown today, calling for peace and denouncing the rebel Revolutionary United Front. Demonstrators converged on the city's main sports stadium in preparation for a rally to demand that the RUF and rebel leader Foday Sankoh release hundreds of UN staff they have been holding captive for the past week. \"We are on the streets today to show the world that Foday Sankoh is nobody but a monster who wants to kill the people of Sierra Leone,\" said Abubakarr Sillah, one of the demonstrators. The Foreign Office urged British nationals to leave Sierra Leone, after the rebels took hostage at least 300 UN peacekeepers and started marching on the capital, Freetown. Another 200 UN peacekeepers are missing in the interior of the country. One of those abducted is a British military observer who had been working with the UN. The first flight of British troops arrived in Senegal early today. The frigate Chatham, the helicopter carrier Ocean and three support ships are due to arrive off the West African coast in the next few days. Mr Hoon said the troops would be in place \"very quickly\" should the situation deteriorate and would remain for \"as long as it takes to secure the situation and allow British nationals to leave safely\". Five hundred British nationals are estimated to be in Sierra Leone. British military advisers flew into Sierra Leone at the weekend to advise the UN, whose peacekeeping operation is in danger of unravelling. Around a dozen men will be based in Freetown, where they will assess the technical support needed to enhance the effectiveness of the UN force of 8,000. The British team, drawn from all three armed services, was put together in response to a call for reinforcements from UN secretary-general Kofi Annan. Britain's shadow defence secretary Iain Duncan Smith said it was vital for British troops to be kept to a limited and precisely defined mission to aid British nationals, rather than becoming embroiled in the chaos of Sierra Leone's civil conflict. \"The concern I would have is that it is clear in their mandate that they are there to get the British nationals out, but not to get sucked into a civil war,\" he said. \"In these sorts of circumstances, once they are deployed, you don't want them hanging around for any great period of time. Otherwise, what happens very quickly is that they get sucked into that deteriorating situation and will need heavier and heavier equipment and firepower to secure their position.\" The much-criticised peace deal brokered by the UN last July was supposed to end one of the most vicious civil wars in Africa during which RUF rebels mutilated and tortured civilians as part of their terror campaign. RUF leader Foday Sankoh was brought into the government as vice-president and his supporters were supposed to give up their arms. But disputes have arisen over power and control of territory, particularly diamond-producing areas. Useful links Sierra Leone Web Graphic: what's happening",

In the space of a torrid few days, four peacekeepers have been killed, several hundred taken hostage, and the power-sharing agreement brokered in Togo last July with rebels of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has begun rapidly to unravel.</p> <p>Although there are hopes that a new mediation effort will yet calm the situation, fighting reportedly continued east of Freetown while aid workers and foreign nationals wondered whether to flee the jittery capital.</p> <p>The problem, however, is that a UN decision to abandon its mission would certainly presage an even bigger disaster for the long-suffering people of Sierra Leone. Having finally become involved in trying to rebuild this tragic country after a lengthy, brutal civil war in which many tens of thousands of civilians were killed, tortured and mutilated, the UN must not even think of backing off now.</p> <p>Since the UN mission was launched last December as a replacement for a Nigerian-led West African force, Foday Sankoh, the RUF leader, has, by stages, put the UN's commitment to the test.

      "bodyText": "The United Nations mission to Sierra Leone was looking disaster in the face last night. In the space of a torrid few days, four peacekeepers have been killed, several hundred taken hostage, and the power-sharing agreement brokered in Togo last July with rebels of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) has begun rapidly to unravel. Although there are hopes that a new mediation effort will yet calm the situation, fighting reportedly continued east of Freetown while aid workers and foreign nationals wondered whether to flee the jittery capital. The problem, however, is that a UN decision to abandon its mission would certainly presage an even bigger disaster for the long-suffering people of Sierra Leone. Having finally become involved in trying to rebuild this tragic country after a lengthy, brutal civil war in which many tens of thousands of civilians were killed, tortured and mutilated, the UN must not even think of backing off now. Since the UN mission was launched last December as a replacement for a Nigerian-led West African force, Foday Sankoh, the RUF leader, has, by stages, put the UN's commitment to the test. The main disagreement is ostensibly about the pace and scope of RUF disarmament; but the prime issues are power and control of territory, particularly diamond-producing areas. While the 1,600 Nigerians attached to the UN force are familiar with the undisciplined but fearsome rebel army of up to 15,000 men and boys, and with the terrain, the mission's Indian commander and detachments from Zambia, Jordan, Kenya and elsewhere are new to the job. The 8,000-strong force is still one quarter below strength and not yet fully equipped. These difficulties have been compounded by severe communciation problems and bureaucratic snafus. Diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis have, meanwhile, been equally chaotic, with Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, appealing dramatically to western countries for emergency troop deployments while half a dozen regional leaders engaged in apparently uncoordinated mediation attempts. Quite apart from the killing and hostage-taking, reminiscent of the UN debacle in Rwanda and its humiliation by the Bosnian Serbs, many UN weapons and vehicles are now in RUF hands. President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia voiced bitter frustration at the weekend, openly calling into question the competence of the force commanders.

      "body": "<p>Douglas Fairbanks Jr, who has died aged 90, carried his father's name proudly, though he had to overcome paternal neglect and the comparison with one of Hollywood's legendary stars. Although an attractive and competent actor, he was also runner-up to similar dashing, well-spoken, romantic leads such as Errol Flynn, an exact contemporary, and Ronald Colman. Nevertheless, he managed to carve out a satisfactory career for himself in the movies, and become a prominent personality in other fields.</p> <p>Despite having all the advantages of a Hollywood kid, his childhood and adolescence were not propitious. Because there could be only one Douglas Fairbanks, his father and mother, Anna Beth Sully, a Rhode Island heiress, referred to their child as \"the boy\". His Irish nurse pronounced it \"bye', and from then on he was called Bye by his family and friends.</p> <p>Douglas Sr, always insecure despite his stardom, later confessed that he had \"no more paternal feelings than a tiger in the jungle with his cub.\" As Bye grew into a chubby child, and his father was forced on occasions to take his son out, he was obviously uncomfortable at being seen with him. This reserve and restraint rubbed off on the boy. \"I never kissed him until he was on his deathbed,\" Doug Jr recalled.</p> <p>Out of guilt, his father gave his son a pony, but one day the boy came home to find that his father had given it to Prince Hirohito of Japan. His mother, on the other hand, tried to give him double helpings of love. He was brought up by her from the age of nine when his parents divorced.</p> <p>The young Fairbanks sculpted and painted from early youth, exhibiting at 13, and made his screen debut at the same age in Stephen Steps Out, an unsuccessful attempt by Jesse Lasky to exploit the magic of the Fairbanks name.</p> <p>A few years later, when Doug Jr told his father, now married to Mary Pickford, that he wanted to become an actor and not go to Harvard, he threatened to disown his son, and cut him out of his will.</p> <p>Without his father's financial assistance, Fairbanks accepted bit parts and wrote titles for silent films. Gradually, he started to get juvenile leads, notably in Stella Dallas (1925) as Loise Moran's upper-class beau.</p> <p>In 1927, he was set to star opposite Greta Garbo in Women Love Diamonds, but when the Swedish star went on strike for more pay, he got Pauline Starke instead. However, the following year he was recompensed by being fourth-billed in Garbo's film A Woman of Affairs.</p> <p>In 1929, he married up-and-coming star Joan Crawford. His father called her a cradle snatcher (she was five years older than the groom) and an opportunist who wanted to marry a famous name.</p> <p>Doug Jr and Joan appeared together as a married couple in Women Love Dia monds, but were divorced four years later after she had deceived him with Clark Gable.</p> <p>From 1930 to 1935, Fairbanks was in great demand, playing, as he remarked, \"big roles in little pictures, and little roles in big pictures.\" The big pictures included Howard Hawks' The Dawn Patrol, in which he was Neil Hamilton's kid brother sent on a fatal mission, and Little Caesar when he was Edward G Robinson's driver with ambitions to gangsterhood.</p> <p>The best of the smaller pictures were the screwball comedy Love is a Racket, the real-time one-location drama Union Depot, and the boxing melodrama The Life of Jimmy Nolan, with excellent varied performances from Fairbanks. In Morning Glory (1933), he played a writer in love with actress Katharine Hepburn, an unrequited emotion he felt for her offscreen.</p> <p>The following year, he came to England to play the Grand Duke Peter opposite Elisabeth Bergner in Catherine the Great for Alexander Korda. Fairbanks coped well as the Tsar who loses his wits, while Bergner turned on her over-girlish charm, encouraged by the indulgent direction of Paul Czinna, her Hungarian husband.</p> <p>Goebbels did not ban the film in Germany but got the Nazi press to call it a film \"produced by and starring Jews\". (Fairbanks' paternal grandfather was a Jewish lawyer called Hezekiah Charles Ulman.)</p> <p>In 1935 Fairbanks was living beyond his means, and immersed in an affair with Gertrude Lawrence with whom he starred as the Bohemian Rudolphe in the film Mimi, and in the West End in Moonlight is Silver. However, he managed to raise enough capital to set up his own English-based company, Criterion Productions.</p> <p>The Amateur Gentleman (1936) - the first and best of three pictures for Criterion, was set in Regency times. He played an innkeeper's son who poses as a gentleman pugilist to gain entrance to the court of the Prince Regent.</p> <p>His father (reconciled with his son) arrived with Lord and Lady Louis Mountbatten at Elstree to watch the shooting. They were suitably impressed by the largest set built for a British film to date, a 13,000sq ft reconstruction of the ballroom at Carlton House for the Prince Regent's ball. But the picture didn't do as well at the box-office as was hoped, and Criterion struggled on with two more lame productions.</p> <p>Fairbanks was carrying on an affair with Marlene Dietrich, who used to smuggle him into her hotel room at Claridge's, when he met socialite Mary Lee Hartford at a party given by Merle Oberon. His wild oats sown, he married her in 1938, a marriage that lasted for 50 years until her death.</p> <p>Meanwhile, back in Hollywood, Fairbanks had made a splendid Rupert of Henzau, the soldier-swordsman in The Prisoner of Zenda (1937) whose confrontation with the film's hero, Ronald Colman, provides the film's exciting climax.</p> <p>A number of good parts followed, in which he was able to put on his pukka accent and a pith-helmet in British colonial adventures. In fact, his accent bore a striking resemblance to Ronald Colman's distinctive British tones. \"By Golly\" was one of his favourite expressions.</p> <p>In George Stevens' Gunga Din (1939) Fairbanks was the gentleman soldier at the side of rough Victor McLaglen and cheeky Cary Grant, a devil-may-care trio fighting a murderous sect of religious fanatics in India. (It was filmed in Lone Pine, California.) In the same year that his father died aged 56, Fairbanks made a conscious decision to emulate his celebrated swashbuckling style.</p> <p>He took the title roles in The Corsican Brothers (1941), with 21-year-olds Mario and Lucien (Fairbanks was a young-looking 32) setting out to avenge their father's death. The picture was reminiscent of his father's 1922 Robin Hood, and after the second world war Doug Jr gave an acrobatic performance as Sinbad the Sailor (1947), a reasonable attempt to rival his father's in The Black Pirate. In The Fighting O'Flynn (1949), he portrayed a kind of Irish musketeer, scaling walls and leaping across roofs with reckless abandon.</p> <p>During the war, as a lieutenant commander in the US Navy, Fairbanks had participated in several combined Anglo-American operations (recalled in his memoirs, A Hell of a War) and in 1949 he was made an Honorary Knight of the British Empire for \"furthering Anglo-American amity.\" Other honours he received were the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur and Knight Grand Officer of King George I of Greece.</p> <p>After retiring from the screen in the early 1950s Fairbanks, an avid Anglophile, settled in London for many years with his wife and three daughters. He thrived on eminent social and political connections, which included a close relationship with the royal family.</p> <p>\"I am not a socialite,\" he once declared, \"though I seem to have got the reputation for being one. I have some very good friends who happen to be in so-called Society; but Society as such is a bore and holds no fascination for me.\"</p> <p>However, whoever was invited to No 8 The Boltons in Kensington, from the highest in the land to the lowliest of hacks, was greeted with charm and impeccable courtesy.</p> <p>During the 1960s, he introduced and sometimes acted in a British TV drama series Douglas Fairbanks Presents, from which he made a lot of money to add to the fortune gained from the manufacture of popcorn, and from the rights to his father's films.</p> <p>In 1973 he and his wife sold their London home and settled in Palm Beach, Florida. Soon after, Fairbanks returned to the stage in My Fair Lady in LA and San Francisco, The Secretary Bird in Chicago and Present Laughter in Washington.</p> <p>In 1976 he appeared at the Phoenix Theatre in London in The Pleasure of his Company in a role that could have been written for him, that of a rich, witty and urbane globetrotter.</p> <p>In 1990, Fairbanks married again at the age of 81 to Vera Shelton who survives him as do three daughters from his second marriage. Two years later, he was named as the mysterious headless man in a photo used in the Duchess of Argyle divorce case of 1963. He always denied that it was he, though the Duchess was a close friend. By golly, what a life!</p> <p>Douglas Fairbanks Jr, actor and socialite, born December 9 1909; died May 7 2000</p>",

A few years later, when Doug Jr told his father, now married to Mary Pickford, that he wanted to become an actor and not go to Harvard, he threatened to disown his son, and cut him out of his will. Without his father's financial assistance, Fairbanks accepted bit parts and wrote titles for silent films. Gradually, he started to get juvenile leads, notably in Stella Dallas (1925) as Loise Moran's upper-class beau. In 1927, he was set to star opposite Greta Garbo in Women Love Diamonds, but when the Swedish star went on strike for more pay, he got Pauline Starke instead. However, the following year he was recompensed by being fourth-billed in Garbo's film A Woman of Affairs. In 1929, he married up-and-coming star Joan Crawford. His father called her a cradle snatcher (she was five years older than the groom) and an opportunist who wanted to marry a famous name. Doug Jr and Joan appeared together as a married couple in Women Love Dia monds, but were divorced four years later after she had deceived him with Clark Gable. From 1930 to 1935, Fairbanks was in great demand, playing, as he remarked, \"big roles in little pictures, and little roles in big pictures.\" The big pictures included Howard Hawks' The Dawn Patrol, in which he was Neil Hamilton's kid brother sent on a fatal mission, and Little Caesar when he was Edward G Robinson's driver with ambitions to gangsterhood. The best of the smaller pictures were the screwball comedy Love is a Racket, the real-time one-location drama Union Depot, and the boxing melodrama The Life of Jimmy Nolan, with excellent varied performances from Fairbanks. In Morning Glory (1933), he played a writer in love with actress Katharine Hepburn, an unrequited emotion he felt for her offscreen. The following year, he came to England to play the Grand Duke Peter opposite Elisabeth Bergner in Catherine the Great for Alexander Korda. Fairbanks coped well as the Tsar who loses his wits, while Bergner turned on her over-girlish charm, encouraged by the indulgent direction of Paul Czinna, her Hungarian husband. Goebbels did not ban the film in Germany but got the Nazi press to call it a film \"produced by and starring Jews\". (Fairbanks' paternal grandfather was a Jewish lawyer called Hezekiah Charles Ulman.) In 1935 Fairbanks was living beyond his means, and immersed in an affair with Gertrude Lawrence with whom he starred as the Bohemian Rudolphe in the film Mimi, and in the West End in Moonlight is Silver. However, he managed to raise enough capital to set up his own English-based company, Criterion Productions. The Amateur Gentleman (1936) - the first and best of three pictures for Criterion, was set in Regency times. He played an innkeeper's son who poses as a gentleman pugilist to gain entrance to the court of the Prince Regent. His father (reconciled with his son) arrived with Lord and Lady Louis Mountbatten at Elstree to watch the shooting. They were suitably impressed by the largest set built for a British film to date, a 13,000sq ft reconstruction of the ballroom at Carlton House for the Prince Regent's ball. But the picture didn't do as well at the box-office as was hoped, and Criterion struggled on with two more lame productions. Fairbanks was carrying on an affair with Marlene Dietrich, who used to smuggle him into her hotel room at Claridge's, when he met socialite Mary Lee Hartford at a party given by Merle Oberon. His wild oats sown, he married her in 1938, a marriage that lasted for 50 years until her death. Meanwhile, back in Hollywood, Fairbanks had made a splendid Rupert of Henzau, the soldier-swordsman in The Prisoner of Zenda (1937) whose confrontation with the film's hero, Ronald Colman, provides the film's exciting climax. A number of good parts followed, in which he was able to put on his pukka accent and a pith-helmet in British colonial adventures. In fact, his accent bore a striking resemblance to Ronald Colman's distinctive British tones. \"By Golly\" was one of his favourite expressions. In George Stevens' Gunga Din (1939) Fairbanks was the gentleman soldier at the side of rough Victor McLaglen and cheeky Cary Grant, a devil-may-care trio fighting a murderous sect of religious fanatics in India. (It was filmed in Lone Pine, California.) In the same year that his father died aged 56, Fairbanks made a conscious decision to emulate his celebrated swashbuckling style. He took the title roles in The Corsican Brothers (1941), with 21-year-olds Mario and Lucien (Fairbanks was a young-looking 32) setting out to avenge their father's death. The picture was reminiscent of his father's 1922 Robin Hood, and after the second world war Doug Jr gave an acrobatic performance as Sinbad the Sailor (1947), a reasonable attempt to rival his father's in The Black Pirate. In The Fighting O'Flynn (1949), he portrayed a kind of Irish musketeer, scaling walls and leaping across roofs with reckless abandon. During the war, as a lieutenant commander in the US Navy, Fairbanks had participated in several combined Anglo-American operations (recalled in his memoirs, A Hell of a War) and in 1949 he was made an Honorary Knight of the British Empire for \"furthering Anglo-American amity.\" Other honours he received were the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur and Knight Grand Officer of King George I of Greece. After retiring from the screen in the early 1950s Fairbanks, an avid Anglophile, settled in London for many years with his wife and three daughters. He thrived on eminent social and political connections, which included a close relationship with the royal family. \"I am not a socialite,\" he once declared, \"though I seem to have got the reputation for being one. I have some very good friends who happen to be in so-called Society; but Society as such is a bore and holds no fascination for me.\" However, whoever was invited to No 8 The Boltons in Kensington, from the highest in the land to the lowliest of hacks, was greeted with charm and impeccable courtesy. During the 1960s, he introduced and sometimes acted in a British TV drama series Douglas Fairbanks Presents, from which he made a lot of money to add to the fortune gained from the manufacture of popcorn, and from the rights to his father's films. In 1973 he and his wife sold their London home and settled in Palm Beach, Florida. Soon after, Fairbanks returned to the stage in My Fair Lady in LA and San Francisco, The Secretary Bird in Chicago and Present Laughter in Washington. In 1976 he appeared at the Phoenix Theatre in London in The Pleasure of his Company in a role that could have been written for him, that of a rich, witty and urbane globetrotter. In 1990, Fairbanks married again at the age of 81 to Vera Shelton who survives him as do three daughters from his second marriage. Two years later, he was named as the mysterious headless man in a photo used in the Duchess of Argyle divorce case of 1963. He always denied that it was he, though the Duchess was a close friend. By golly, what a life! Douglas Fairbanks Jr, actor and socialite, born December 9 1909; died May 7 2000",

      "bodyText": "Fresh violence erupted in Zimbabwe yesterday as one group of President Robert Mugabe's supporters beat a white farmer unconscious and another went on the rampage in a Harare factory. Violence from Mr Mugabe's supporters is blamed for the deaths of 18 supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) since April 1. Alan Dunn, a farmer in the Beatrice area, 50 miles south of Harare, had his skull and both arms fractured by a gang of Mr Mugabe's supporters yesterday afternoon. Harare's Avenues clinic said Mr Dunn was in a \"serious condition\". Four more farms in the south of the country were also invaded. Another group of 200 war veterans invaded the factory and workers' quarters of the Zimbabwe Fertiliser Company, on the outskirts of Harare. The war veterans had warned the factory manager last week that his staff were all supporters of the opposition MDC and that he should hire Zanu-PF supporters or risk violence. Yesterday the war veterans broke in and began beating up workers, 300 of whom live in staff quarters at the factory. Mr Mugabe's supporters went from house to house, smashing the windows, dragging out the inhabitants and beating them. Police were present but they took no action. In Masvingo, a Mugabe stronghold in southern Zimbabwe, there were demonstrations by 1,000 supporters of the MDC. Two men wearing shirts with the Zanu-PF logo were beaten up at the rally. The MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, told protesters: \"Mugabe has told people they can invade farms, but if we have no tobacco we have no foreign currency, which is why the country is suffering with things like fuel shortages \"Zanu-PF has created an environment where everyone now lives in fear. Because of this, farmworkers cannot work and business is declining.\" As the MDC rally was taking place the leader of the squatters, Chenjerai Hunzvi, said that supporters of the ruling party must seek out British passport holders and force them to leave Zimbabwe. Speaking at a Zanu-PF rally in Glen Norah, south of Harare, he stepped up the party's anti-British rhetoric by saying that the 20,000 people eligible for British passports among the country's 70,000 white citizens were not just welcome to leave Zimbabwe, they must do so. British passport holders who want to stay should share their land and throw away their British passports, he said. Meanwhile economists in Harare have warned that Zimbabwe's economy is expected to contract by at least 5% this year. President Robert Mugabe's \"scorched earth\" economic policies may produce short-term political gains but will wreck the economy, they said. The instability is also affecting neighbouring economies, including Malawi and South Africa. Inflation is 50% and rising and the maintenance of a fixed exchange rate has made several key sectors such as mining and agriculture unprofitable. This has led a group of Zimbabwean business leaders to write an open letter to Mr Mugabe calling for a fair election. South African business leaders have also called for an end to the violence.",

There are no cars or pedestrians, but the silence seems wrong.</p> <p>As finally I spot a manned kiosk, a black shape moves from the shadows to block my path, only its eyes and teeth visible. Suddenly behind me is a growling outline of what looks like a wolf. The pair erupt into noise and, in an instant, normality is restored: a late-night chorus of whining, howling and baying from hundreds of strays fills this little corner of the Romanian capital.</p> <p>Bucharest's 2m humans have long been used to sharing their city with a population of feral dogs estimated at up to a quarter of a million - possibly the largest in Europe. The animals can be seen everywhere: they promenade in packs through the parks, scavenge among dustbins, wander in and out of cafes for titbits, and cover long journeys by riding the metro.</p> <p>I escaped my confrontation unscathed. (I followed the advice of a local guide, and stood my ground, showed my teeth and pretended to throw something at the pair.) Reports suggest not everyone is so lucky - some 300 locals are treated each month for bites.</p> <p>As the population of strays has grown over the past decade, so has the competition for food, making the dogs ever more aggressive. Although the city authorities have been reluctant to admit there is a dog problem, belatedly they have started to act, exhorting residents to take the strays along to sterilisation centres. So far the response has been poor.</p> <p>Surprisingly, given the menace they represent, there is almost universal fondness for the strays.

      "bodyText": "It's 2am, a heavy shower has failed to wash away the heat of a spring night, and I am searching for one of the thousands of \"non-stop\" shops that service Bucharest by day but rarely seem to be open after midnight. There are no cars or pedestrians, but the silence seems wrong. As finally I spot a manned kiosk, a black shape moves from the shadows to block my path, only its eyes and teeth visible. Suddenly behind me is a growling outline of what looks like a wolf. The pair erupt into noise and, in an instant, normality is restored: a late-night chorus of whining, howling and baying from hundreds of strays fills this little corner of the Romanian capital. Bucharest's 2m humans have long been used to sharing their city with a population of feral dogs estimated at up to a quarter of a million - possibly the largest in Europe. The animals can be seen everywhere: they promenade in packs through the parks, scavenge among dustbins, wander in and out of cafes for titbits, and cover long journeys by riding the metro. I escaped my confrontation unscathed. (I followed the advice of a local guide, and stood my ground, showed my teeth and pretended to throw something at the pair.) Reports suggest not everyone is so lucky - some 300 locals are treated each month for bites. As the population of strays has grown over the past decade, so has the competition for food, making the dogs ever more aggressive. Although the city authorities have been reluctant to admit there is a dog problem, belatedly they have started to act, exhorting residents to take the strays along to sterilisation centres. So far the response has been poor. Surprisingly, given the menace they represent, there is almost universal fondness for the strays. Most residents know the dogs that \"belong\" to their apartment block and feed them as though they were pets. Such indulgence is not as bizarre as it sounds - it is born of a lingering sense of solidarity. The strays, like so many humans here, were the victims of the late communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his attempts to create a country fit for the \"new socialist man\". In the 1980s, Ceausescu set about demolishing rural communities so that he could graft on to the countryside Soviet-style heavy industry. In practice, his systematisation programme was as imaginative as its name: tens of thousands of Romanians were forced from the land and into huge estates of high-rise concrete. They lost the two things that most symbolised home - their garden allotment and their dog. Lumi, who works for a publishing firm in the capital, says many Romanians regard the strays as a final link to their past: \"There is a strong tradition here of owning a dog and my parents, like many others, had to abandon theirs when they moved. \"We don't know what happened to her. When we feed the neighbourhood dogs, we can't help but think these strays may be the offspring of our own dog.\" Such sentimentality contrasts strongly with the Romanians' attitude towards another group of Ceausescu's victims - the thousands of orphans locked away in state institutions. They are the legacy of the second prong of the Ceausescu programme: he banned contraception and forced women to have more children than they could afford to look after in an attempt to swell the workforce for his new industries. Romania's continuing failure to acknowledge the plight of these children has long attracted international condemnation. Unfairly, says Lumi. \"Foreigners do not realise how little Romanians knew about the orphanages for a long time,\" she said. \"The orphans were not visible, not like the dogs on the streets. \"Now, when so many people are poor, hungry and living in cramped apartments, they don't feel they can take the responsibility of adopting a child. It's much easier to be a parent to a stray dog.\"",

Perhaps your colleagues still tease you about the time you mistook the new finance director for the delivery man. There's nothing worse than making a fool of yourself in front of colleagues. But for most of us, mercifully, gaffes this bad are rare. </p> <p>If you are seriously shy, however, every day feels like a minefield of potential blunders, and even something as simple as answering the phone can leave you wanting to hide under the desk. It's natural, of course, to feel anxious before a job interview or an important meeting. But people who are extremely shy can feel that it seriously interferes with their lives, restricting their ability to do their job properly. </p> <p>\"Shy people feel that everyone is looking at them and judging what they do,\" says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, \"but the opposite is true. People take much more notice of extroverts in the workplace. In certain roles, this can be a handicap. You may be producing the work, but if you're not noticed you may not get the recognition that you deserve.\" </p> <p>Cooper believes shyness comes from the family background: for example if shy people had dominant parents or siblings, they may have grown up feeling overwhelmed. But, he stresses, this doesn't mean you are stuck with it. \"Lots of people are shy and they learn to cope with it. If your role at work requires you to deal with people, or you have power and influence, you learn to act the part.\" </p> <p>Hazel Montgomery agrees. As a seasoned temp, she is constantly starting new jobs and meeting new people, so she often feels self-conscious. \"You develop ways to appear more confident than you feel inside,\" she says. \"I find it helps to ask a few questions when you're new, find out where the toilets are, whether there's a coffee machine, that kind of thing. It breaks the ice.\" </p> <p>One of Montgomery's coping strategies is to make sure she always says something in a meeting, to show she is paying attention. \"But I usually wait for someone else to speak first, so I don't feel so nervous. My pet hate is when someone leans over me to show me something. It makes me feel all panicky, like I'm back at school. I usually go and get a drink of water to allow me to calm down.\" </p> <p>Lynne Crawford is a therapist specialising in shyness. She uses a variety of techniques including psychotherapy and neuro-linguistic programming to treat her clients. \"You have to teach the subconscious more flexible ways of behaving,\" she says, \"and you treat the mind and body together. Emotions are stored in the body, and allergies, for example, can often make shyness worse.\" </p> <p>She suggests people relax before important meetings by listening to comedy tapes. \"You should also get up and move about,\" she continues. \"The body becomes rigid when we're anxious. Concentrate on sitting in a relaxed, yet alert position. Try to visualise the last time you felt like that, perhaps when you were with friends, and notice your posture. Recreate that posture in meetings.\" </p> <p>It's all about taking your time, and resisting the urge to panic. \"If you find yourself drying up in the middle of a speech,\" says Crawford, \"just stop and take a sip of water to recover. It's useful to have a couple of well-prepared jokes ready to help you.\" </p> <p>Crawford also uses homeopathy in her work. \"Lycopodium is a good remedy for self-esteem and it's also good for the liver,\" she says. \"Shy people often have a lot of anger or fear and that affects the liver. Belladonna is good for blushing - take it as soon as you feel yourself starting to go red.\" </p> <p>And the simplest trick? \"A smile is universal. It makes you look more approachable so your colleagues will make the effort to come to you. And there is a lot of truth in the old saying, 'keep your chin up'. If you hold your head upright, it allows serotonin, the happiness hormone, to reach the brain more easily.\" </p> <p>But a bit of reticence in the workplace isn't necessarily a bad thing, says Cooper. \"People tend to like shy people. They show their vulnerability and they're not as threatening as extroverts. They're also better at focusing on their work and they are good listeners, so people confide in them. We need shy people in the workplace - think how unbearable it would be to work in an office full of extroverts!\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Just six months ago they promised a lucrative new source of income for adland. Now, however, dot.coms stand accused of misspending their advertising millions and failing to understand the concept of branding. To some the reason is simple: too many of these new start-ups are run by greedy entrepreneurs interested only in a fast buck. Others, however, suggest ad agencies themselves are to blame. </p> <p>At the heart of this debate is the claim by a number of leading agencies that many dot.com brands have mistaken having a wacky name, an eye-catching logo and a pocketful of mouth-watering promises for having a brand. </p> <p>\"Most dot.com advertising passes you by - you see it and wonder what the hell it was about,\" says Robert Bean, chairman of ad agency BANC. \"They don't understand branding because of the rush to market which is counter-productive to the steady, consistent planning the development of strong brands requires. 'Life is great with MSN' - what does it mean?\" </p> <p>Key to the prosecution's case is the large amount of money spent on mass market advertising campaigns which, in the race to get famous, simply shout loud - rather than explaining the product or conveying to the consumer any reason to buy or trust the newcomer with his or her well-earned cash. </p> <p>Spontaneous consumer awareness of an advertiser's name is not the same as the consumer having an understanding of and attachment to a particular product, however. As a result, says Charlie Tuke-Hastings, general manager of brand communications agency Yellow Line, which recently launched Littlewoods' Bet 24/7 online service, consumers are starting to greet such communications with: \"Oh no, not another dot.com ad\". </p> <p> \"Branding needs to be so much stronger in the fast-moving dot.com market because few dot.coms have any physical presence, and there is no reason other than a name and a promise for anyone to trust these companies, let alone for anyone to buy,\" he says. </p> <p>Another pitfall has been attempting to win consumers with funky images and efforts to appear cool before getting the product right. In a recent survey by Mori/ICL, only 8% of consumers said quirky brand identities were important in choosing an internet bank. More important was that the bank had an established high street name behind it and could be trusted - a priority cited by 77%. </p> <p>Without doubt a number of high-profile dot.coms should have focused on the quality and consistency of their product before trying to raise awareness - last year boo.com, for example, launched a \u00a320m-plus ad campaign (featuring sportswear-clad geeks capering through New York) before it had finished building its site. </p> <p>Others, meanwhile, have ignored the basic rule that to be a trusted brand they must do as they say - a lesson yet to be learned by computer giant Compaq, which last week refused to honour a deal advertised on its website promoting \u00a3350 PCs for sale at \u00a31. </p> <p>As a result, weak or non-existent branding will be a root cause of the anticipated imminent shake-down in the dot.coms sector, with many falling by the wayside simply because they failed to develop a relationship with the consumer, predicts Caroline Chandy, director of planning at Publicis. </p> <p>\"There are few true online brands,\" she says. \"Few have delivered a consistent promise - which is all-important at a time when service is all.

      "bodyText": "Just six months ago they promised a lucrative new source of income for adland. Now, however, dot.coms stand accused of misspending their advertising millions and failing to understand the concept of branding. To some the reason is simple: too many of these new start-ups are run by greedy entrepreneurs interested only in a fast buck. Others, however, suggest ad agencies themselves are to blame. At the heart of this debate is the claim by a number of leading agencies that many dot.com brands have mistaken having a wacky name, an eye-catching logo and a pocketful of mouth-watering promises for having a brand. \"Most dot.com advertising passes you by - you see it and wonder what the hell it was about,\" says Robert Bean, chairman of ad agency BANC. \"They don't understand branding because of the rush to market which is counter-productive to the steady, consistent planning the development of strong brands requires. 'Life is great with MSN' - what does it mean?\" Key to the prosecution's case is the large amount of money spent on mass market advertising campaigns which, in the race to get famous, simply shout loud - rather than explaining the product or conveying to the consumer any reason to buy or trust the newcomer with his or her well-earned cash. Spontaneous consumer awareness of an advertiser's name is not the same as the consumer having an understanding of and attachment to a particular product, however. As a result, says Charlie Tuke-Hastings, general manager of brand communications agency Yellow Line, which recently launched Littlewoods' Bet 24/7 online service, consumers are starting to greet such communications with: \"Oh no, not another dot.com ad\". \"Branding needs to be so much stronger in the fast-moving dot.com market because few dot.coms have any physical presence, and there is no reason other than a name and a promise for anyone to trust these companies, let alone for anyone to buy,\" he says. Another pitfall has been attempting to win consumers with funky images and efforts to appear cool before getting the product right. In a recent survey by Mori/ICL, only 8% of consumers said quirky brand identities were important in choosing an internet bank. More important was that the bank had an established high street name behind it and could be trusted - a priority cited by 77%. Without doubt a number of high-profile dot.coms should have focused on the quality and consistency of their product before trying to raise awareness - last year boo.com, for example, launched a \u00a320m-plus ad campaign (featuring sportswear-clad geeks capering through New York) before it had finished building its site. Others, meanwhile, have ignored the basic rule that to be a trusted brand they must do as they say - a lesson yet to be learned by computer giant Compaq, which last week refused to honour a deal advertised on its website promoting \u00a3350 PCs for sale at \u00a31. As a result, weak or non-existent branding will be a root cause of the anticipated imminent shake-down in the dot.coms sector, with many falling by the wayside simply because they failed to develop a relationship with the consumer, predicts Caroline Chandy, director of planning at Publicis. \"There are few true online brands,\" she says. \"Few have delivered a consistent promise - which is all-important at a time when service is all. A lot have damaged themselves by not delivering a consistent, quality product. They are relying on consumer curiosity to 'give them a try'.\" This will precipitate the demise of many, she believes, because the market is already crowded, and consumers just don't have the time to try them all. But in spite of all this, some industry observers suggest ambitious dot.com entrepreneurs are not the only ones guilty of greed. Paul Longhurst, managing director of Quantum New Media, whose clients include Thomas Cook.com, points out that few dot.com entrepreneurs are marketing experts - which is why they turn to agencies for advice. \"Many campaigns have ignored the basics - like, what's the proposition, why should the consumer buy the product?

But there is no doubt that the IRA leadership have taken cognisance of the British government's difficulties in finessing a deal with the unionists.

It was introduced into the Ulster peace process in 1995 by John Major's government as a political brake to essentially exert British control. It is now being used by anti-agreement unionists like Donaldson and David Burnside to sabotage further political progress. As a concept \"decommissioning\" remains useful to these critics because it masks their true intentions; not to share power, to bring down the assembly, to beat the Orange drum, and hopefully provoke a bit of war to shore up the union. The only republicans they want to meet are dead republicans. So of course the latest IRA gesture on arms dumps will not satisfy these critics either. They will want more \"concessions\".

He said it was no good governments \"being intellectually convinced that this is the best way to help the poorest pensioner if pensioners on the doorsteps don't believe its benefitting them.\"</p> <p>Another cabinet minister called for a big shake-up, but not a revolution. \"First, we have to show we are on people's side. We presume because we are delivering, the electorate knows about it and they feel it. They don't.</p> <p>\"Secondly, we have to be much better at anticipating what is coming up. The horrible explosive cocktail that hit us last month - pensioners, asylum seekers, crime, Tony Martin, Section 28 - had been building up for a long time, but nobody managed to anticipate it.</p> <p>\"Thirdly, in the run-up to 1997 we managed to make politics interesting, but we have got bogged down and immersed in government. We have lost that and we are not touching young people.\"</p> <p>The cabinet minister at the heart of the day to day political combat said: \"I have come to the conclusion that what people would like is a period of silence from us. They would like a break from it. They just want us to deliver, be competent and be trustworthy.\"</p> <p>It is expected that Mr Mandelson will stay as Northern Ireland secretary, working alongside Mr Brown on the general election strategy. There had been speculation that Mr Mandelson would return to mainland politics as cabinet office minister, giving him time to plan the election strategy, but he believes that would be a mistake.</p> <p>If devolution does successfully return to Northern Ireland, it is thought Mr Mandelson would have the spare time to increase his election-planning workload.</p>",

Ministers also believe the electorate might punish the government if it went to the polls a year early when it had a Commons majority of 180 and no obvious need to seek a fresh mandate. Mr Prescott openly admitted that the government may have made a political blunder in increasing the basic pension by only 75p a week and allocating most extra resources to the \u00a3150 winter fuel payments instead. He said it was no good governments \"being intellectually convinced that this is the best way to help the poorest pensioner if pensioners on the doorsteps don't believe its benefitting them.\" Another cabinet minister called for a big shake-up, but not a revolution. \"First, we have to show we are on people's side. We presume because we are delivering, the electorate knows about it and they feel it. They don't. \"Secondly, we have to be much better at anticipating what is coming up. The horrible explosive cocktail that hit us last month - pensioners, asylum seekers, crime, Tony Martin, Section 28 - had been building up for a long time, but nobody managed to anticipate it. \"Thirdly, in the run-up to 1997 we managed to make politics interesting, but we have got bogged down and immersed in government. We have lost that and we are not touching young people.\" The cabinet minister at the heart of the day to day political combat said: \"I have come to the conclusion that what people would like is a period of silence from us. They would like a break from it. They just want us to deliver, be competent and be trustworthy.\" It is expected that Mr Mandelson will stay as Northern Ireland secretary, working alongside Mr Brown on the general election strategy. There had been speculation that Mr Mandelson would return to mainland politics as cabinet office minister, giving him time to plan the election strategy, but he believes that would be a mistake. If devolution does successfully return to Northern Ireland, it is thought Mr Mandelson would have the spare time to increase his election-planning workload.",

NTSB sources say the same basic facts have remained unchanged. There was no evidence of a fire, explosion or any sort of malfunction at the time the autopilot was turned off. No alarm had sounded in the cockpit before the plane was put into its steep dive.

An attempt is made to increase the engines' power but after a moment, they are switched off, and the flight recorders stop working. For the Egyptians, the unusual elevator movement is evidence of a malfunction or sabotage in the plane's tail. For the US team, it show's a pilot and a co-pilot struggling at cross-purposes. If that is the case, a piece of metal called a \"torque tube\", which normally ensures that the flaps move together, should have been broken in two. That tube, investigators hope, will finally provide the \"smoking gun\" for the fate of EgyptAir 990. But an NTSB spokesman on Friday said he could not confirm it had been found. Even if it is, it is hard to imagine it will be enough to convince everyone, especially in the Arab world, that a trusted pilot simply took the controls and pointed a plane full of people towards the ocean.",

Film from club cameras at Rotherham United has caught the sequence of events as South Wales brewery drayman Terry Coles, 41, was hit by the horse as police struggled to get 100 Swansea City fans to their seats while rival fans hurled bottles and other missiles at each other. Furious friends of Coles, a separated father-of-two, said the horse had been \"cantering and out of control\" and placed a wreath at Swansea's ground with a message invoking the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy: \"Another death at the hands of South Yorkshire police.\" But the force, whose reaction after the accident was praised by Coles' wife, Christine, said the CCTV film appeared to show the horse trotting and fully under control when the fan turned into its path without looking. The mounted officer, described as \"very experienced\" by South Yorkshire police, was taken off duty suffering from shock after the accident - the first death involving a police horse in Britain for more than 20 years. The independent Police Complaints Authority began an inquiry yesterday, and announced that it would be led by an officer from outside South Yorkshire police. South Yorkshire is holding its own investigation, helped by South Wales. \"This is a very sad day for football,\" said South Yorkshire assistant chief constable Tim Hollis, who also heads Britain's police-planning for European football competitions. \"The vast majority of supporters who came to the match were law-abiding, genuine football fans who wanted to enjoy what was an important game for both teams. \"The sadness is that small numbers of supporters on both sides conducted themselves in such a way that there were significant policing problems and this tragic death.\" A woman mounted officer was injured in a separate incident before the sell-out Third Division Championship decider, and 20 fans from Rotherham and Swansea were charged with public order offences yesterday. Fighting broke out after heavy drinking in the town centre, and 10 arrests had been made before the Swansea fans were funnelled into single-track Millmoor Lane, which leads to the turnstiles. Coles, who lived in the Morriston area of Swansea, died in hospital from spleen and kidney injuries.

      "bodyText": "Those with long-ish memories may have spotted a certain irony in the stock exchange heading out of British control just as Rover, the car maker, appears to be heading back home after six years abroad. When BMW snapped up the remains of what had been British Leyland, there was much stern talk from City circles about the need for UK types to shed their \"obsession\" with ownership and to grasp the simple fact that it mattered not whether the share certificates were held in Birmingham, London, Frankfurt or points east. The Square Mile was given an opportunity to demonstrate its faith in this principle rather more quickly than it can have expected. A few months after Rover was sold, Britain's oldest merchant bank, Barings, was brought to its knees by a \u00a3800m rogue trading scandal. The damage this did to British investment banking can be measured by the fact that within a few years just about all the City's major houses had passed into foreign hands. Now the exchange itself is going into \"partnership\" with Frankfurt, and already there are signs that this is the type of partnership best exemplified by the television detectives Randall &amp; Hopkirk, and no prizes for guessing which one is deceased. In parallel with all these urgings and exhortations to abandon our obsession with ownership has been a similar volume of proselytising on behalf of the nation the view that companies themselves need no longer actually own anything. Airlines, for example, ought to slim down to a ticket reservation system and rent their aeroplanes from somebody else, while a telephone company's real asset is its billing system and not its dreary old telephones. The exciting vista is thus opened of a domestic economy dominated by companies based abroad and with no assets. No doubt this is the sort of \"future\" that we are always attempting to ram down the throats of our European friends, those nations that cling to fuddy duddy ideas about ownership in all its senses. That we are running a colossal trade deficit with the clapped out continentals merely shows how ahead of our time we really are. In the words of the self-promoting office politician, whose latest wheeze has cost his employer a packet: \"My problem has always been that of spotting a trend too early.\"",

      "bodyText": "Mobile telephone groups BT Cellnet and One2One are preparing for a battle with the government over what they claim are unfair terms being extended to rival Vodafone Airtouch over its payment for a third generation mobile phone licence. The Department of Trade and Industry has granted Vodafone a delayed payment period of up to 180 days after the auction ceased on April 27, which is claimed to give the company a \u00a3300m advantage. None of the other four winners of the five licences for third generation phones - BT, One2One, Orange and a newcomer to the UK market, Telesystem International Wireless - have been granted such a concession. These four operators must make their first payments on the licences tomorrow, paying at least half the fee immediately with the remainder due in instalments over the next 10 years. The government's auction of five licences to operate third generation mobile telephones raised an astonishing \u00a322.48bn. These phones will be able to provide fast, high-quality internet access as well as speech and data communications. Vodafone has been granted a delayed payment period because of its ownership of Orange, which came about through its takeover of German mobile phone group Mannesmann. Under the terms of the auction, no two companies in the same ownership could bid for a licence. The delayed payment by Vodafone of 180 days is intended to cover the period in which Vodafone intends to demerge Orange. One2One is understood to have claimed that Vodafone could save more than \u00a3300m in interest by being able to delay payment on its licence. Both it and BT want the same terms extended to the other mobile phone operators. A BT spokesman said yesterday: \"We are obviously confident and hopeful that we can easily and amicably achieve agreement with the government.\" Both companies are now in discussions with trade secretary Stephen Byers. The DTI said last night that it was not in \"BT's or anyone else's interest to challenge the auction rules in this way\". There is now the prospect that the auction could be challenged in court if BT and One2One are unable to achieve a satisfactory outcome to the negotiations. \"The government is satisfied that the third generation auction rules were fair to all parties and that they provided an effective auction and complied with domestic and European law,\" the DTI said.",

This has fallen to an average of five - too many, but comparable with a large European city. A thousand schools have been reopened. Much of the country is peaceful; 3,800 small arms have been destroyed and 10,000 more handed in by former members of the KLA. The second multiethnic class of the Kosovo Police Academy has graduated and joined the local multiethnic Kosovo Police Service. The class contained 170 pupils, including 34 Serbs. The need for round-the-clock protection for individual Serbs in Pristina is reducing as the situation improves. Martin Howard Ministry of Defence",

      "bodyText": "John Prescott and Ken Livingstone, London's newly elected mayor, appeared last night to be heading for confrontation after the deputy prime minister made clear he had no intention of backing down over plans to part-privatise the London Undergound. Hopes of an accommodation between the government and Mr Livingstone, who made public ownership and control of the Tube a central plank of his election platform, faded when Mr Prescott insisted there would be no concessions. Mr Livingstone said he hoped \"we can sit down and sort it out sensibly\" and believed that once the contracts were finalised, Mr Prescott would be \"in a position to say this isn't a particularly good deal and back out of it\". But Mr Livingstone added that if the government did try to \"push ahead with a deal that is bad for London, you would have to consider going to a judge and saying, well, is this really right?\" Mr Prescott retorted that \"all sorts of people threaten to take me to court\". He added: \"I have an obligation to bring in the public-private partnership,\" he told the BBC's On the Record programme, \"to provide best value and if I do that, we get on with the contract\". Negotiations with Mr Livingstone would only cause further delays in securing investment for modernisation. Mr Prescott's defiant defence of the government's Tube policy - only the official Labour candidate, Frank Dobson, supported it during the mayoral campaign - comes as he faces a Labour backbench revolt in the Commons this week over his plans to part-privatise air traffic control. The rebellion over the 51% sell-off scheme is expected midweek during the report stage of the transport bill. Last month the prime minister conceded that if Mr Livingstone won the mayoral election on an anti-privatisation ticket, it would \"make it much more difficult to get the work done in the way we want it\". The government has the power to force through its public-private partnership, but faces an outcry if it ignores Mr Livingstone's mandate against the scheme.",

Cynics from the party say the forums are at best talking shops at worst a way to sideline the debate. That cynicism is hugely dangerous because it threatens to undermine the primary process we have for co-ordinating the party on the ground with the party in government.</p> <p>He added: \"If party members use them to foment opposition, party leadership will ignore them. If on the other hand, party leaders ignore what is said in the forums, or fail to give credit to the party for the influence it had in writing the manifesto, then they will be discredited amongst members.\"</p> <p>He also urged the party not to become over-reliant on focus groups, saying they can be helpful in establishing a marketing proposition, but they are not a substitute for representative democracy.</p> <p>He claimed that Labour could still develop into a party of the British people if more attention were devoted to recruiting members and to campaigning in local communities.</p> <p>If it did not, he said, the danger would be a second term win without being the government of the people. \"As a result the electorate will not simply bother to vote. Our activists won't bother to get out of their chairs. We will win the battle, but we will not win the war.\"</p> <p>Mr Pitt-Watson, drawing on his own own experience of Millbank, also admitted that a culture gap had opened between the party headquarters and the rank and file.</p> <p>He said: \"The culture which underpins Millbank's speed, dedication and professionalism can have a cost. This is because its professionalism stands in contrast to the way the party is orgnised on the ground.</p> <p>\"Labour on the ground is a voluntary organisation. It will not, cannot, and arguably should not be able to respond in the way that a professional organisation can. As a result the culture of Millbank grates with that of the larger party.</p> <p>\"Because Millbank and the party in the country operate in these two different political cultures, party members can think of Millbank as distant, arrogant and controlling when it has no intention to be so. And to the professionals, the party on the ground looks like a bunch of amateurs and it treats them accordingly.</p> <p>\"The party cannot just be professional since if you don't engage the people, you will end up with a government which seems distant and arrogant. And of course we see those stresses day in day out, as we observe our government in power.\"</p> <p>He added: \"There is article after article about the government becoming too remote and we hear dire warnings about heartland votes. And this despite the minimum wage, the working family tax credit, \u00a320bn each on health and education, the proud litany of our achievements.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of Millbank's most senior former officials has warned that the Labour Party headquarters and the rank-and-file members are deeply alienated from one another, threatening a collapse in party activism and a low turnout in the next election. The warning has been given by David Pitt-Watson, the party's assistant general secretary until last year. He suggests that unless Millbank learns to trust and respect its volunteers it will turn the Labour Party into a version of the US Democrats. Mr Pitt-Watson is the most senior and loyal figure from within the party machine to admit that the relationship between Millbank and the party rank and file is in need of repair. A paper setting out his analysis of the relationship will form the starting point of a post-local elections inquest between leading Blairities in the party and Millbank and Downing Street officials. Mr Pitt-Watson, the party's finance director for four years, said: \"If you are the assistant general secretary and address any Labour party meeting it is more than likely that an argument will develop about the degree to which the government has allowed the party and its policies to become a marketing proposition: designed to win votes, but with little heed paid to the values for which we all joined and dedicated ourselves. \"Such an argument can readily become heated with the party apparently in opposition to the government which it sought to put in power for 18 years.\" Urging the leadership to respect the party, he warned a dangerous cynicism was rife in the party about the organisational reforms being pushed through the party, including the introduction of policy forums, rather than conference to shape policy. \"Cynics in government will say the forums are a place where ministers are subject to ill-informed and unhelpful criticism. Cynics from the party say the forums are at best talking shops at worst a way to sideline the debate. That cynicism is hugely dangerous because it threatens to undermine the primary process we have for co-ordinating the party on the ground with the party in government. He added: \"If party members use them to foment opposition, party leadership will ignore them. If on the other hand, party leaders ignore what is said in the forums, or fail to give credit to the party for the influence it had in writing the manifesto, then they will be discredited amongst members.\" He also urged the party not to become over-reliant on focus groups, saying they can be helpful in establishing a marketing proposition, but they are not a substitute for representative democracy. He claimed that Labour could still develop into a party of the British people if more attention were devoted to recruiting members and to campaigning in local communities. If it did not, he said, the danger would be a second term win without being the government of the people. \"As a result the electorate will not simply bother to vote. Our activists won't bother to get out of their chairs. We will win the battle, but we will not win the war.\" Mr Pitt-Watson, drawing on his own own experience of Millbank, also admitted that a culture gap had opened between the party headquarters and the rank and file. He said: \"The culture which underpins Millbank's speed, dedication and professionalism can have a cost. This is because its professionalism stands in contrast to the way the party is orgnised on the ground. \"Labour on the ground is a voluntary organisation. It will not, cannot, and arguably should not be able to respond in the way that a professional organisation can. As a result the culture of Millbank grates with that of the larger party. \"Because Millbank and the party in the country operate in these two different political cultures, party members can think of Millbank as distant, arrogant and controlling when it has no intention to be so. And to the professionals, the party on the ground looks like a bunch of amateurs and it treats them accordingly. \"The party cannot just be professional since if you don't engage the people, you will end up with a government which seems distant and arrogant. And of course we see those stresses day in day out, as we observe our government in power.\" He added: \"There is article after article about the government becoming too remote and we hear dire warnings about heartland votes. And this despite the minimum wage, the working family tax credit, \u00a320bn each on health and education, the proud litany of our achievements.\"",

At 47, he is now one of South Africa's leading businessmen with extensive publishing interests. The surrender of ANC arms after a 30-year guerrilla war against white rule was a key element of the negotiations leading to the elections and Ramaphosa had regular contact with Sinn Fein leaders in the early 90s. He also visited Northern Ireland after the Good Friday agreement in a \"neutral and independent\" capacity to share the ANC's experiences with Sinn Fein and to help sell the accord to its followers. Martti Ahtisaari, the former Finnish president, is an experienced negotiator who acted as the EU envoy during the 1999 Kosovo conflict. A veteran UN diplomat and former UN under-secretary general, he won Finland's first direct presidential election in 1994, leaving office in February this year.

      "body": "<p>The tiny ad in the Help Please column of the latest Law Society Gazette looks innocuous, even baffling, unless you happen to be in the know. But for lawyers at the Crown Prosecution Service, it's a red letter warning: the Human Rights Act is coming. Not that they needed it: CPS lawyers have been training for months in the run-up to the Act, which comes into force on October 2.</p> <p>Headed \"Speed Cameras\", the ad says cryptically: \"Identity of driver obtained under s172 RTA 1988 Human Rights Act. If you are advising clients in this area, please contact box A28/01.\" It's a signal that lawyers are poised to jump on a bandwagon already rolling in the Scottish courts, where they have been able to invoke the European Convention on Human Rights since the Scotland Act, bringing in Scottish devolution, became law a year ago.</p> <p>The result has been a year of surprises for the Scottish legal system. First, the high court in Edinburgh ruled that temporary sheriffs - senior lawyers who sit as judges part-time - were not an \"independent and impartial tribunal\" because renewal of their appointments was up to the Lord Advocate, a member of the executive. Accused whose cases were tried before them were therefore not guaranteed a fair trial.</p> <p>In February Scotland's appeal court declared that an important element of the police armoury against drink drivers was unusable. Margaret Brown, 30, was charged after police confronted her at 3am in a 24-hour supermarket smelling of alcohol and clutching a bottle of gin. Asked who had driven the car parked outside, she admitted: \"It was me.\" Section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 makes it an offence for the keeper of a car to refuse to identify the driver if asked by police. Parliament enacted it because a prosecution could not be brought without evidence that the person charged was driving the car.</p> <p>Her own admission was the key evidence that Brown had been driving while over the limit. Without it there would be no prosecution But the court ruled that article 6 of the European Convention, the right to a fair trial, protected her against self-incrimination. So the prosecution could not rely on it as a significant part of the case against her.</p> <p>At Brown's appeal hearing the then solicitor general, Colin Boyd, argued that without section 172, there could be \"momentous effects\" on the use of roadside cameras to trap speeding drivers, since prosecutions relied on the section for proof of the driver's identity. In his judgment, the Lord Justice General, Lord Rodger, left the question of speed traps open, but pointed out that the European Court of Human Rights had ruled that the protection against self-incrimination applied to \"all types of criminal offence without distinction, from the most simple to the most complex\".</p> <p>A senior Scottish judge, Lord McCluskey, burst into print in Scotland on Sunday a few days later, describing the results of the new human rights regime as \"devastating\". He said he had warned in his 1986 Reith lectures that the Canadian charter of rights and freedoms, modelled on the European Convention, would produce \"a field day for crackpots, a pain in the neck for judges and legislators, and a goldmine for lawyers.\" He added: \"Prophetic or what?\"</p> <p>Lord McCluskey predicted: \"The police are about to embark on a helter-skelter of discovery about the restraints upon their traditional powers and practices\". They should be looking \"long and hard\" at article 8 of the convention, which guarantees a right to privacy. It was a right enjoyed by everyone, including \"those whom the police are pursuing because they believe them to be drug dealers, fraudsters, paedophiles or wife-batterers\".

      "bodyText": "The tiny ad in the Help Please column of the latest Law Society Gazette looks innocuous, even baffling, unless you happen to be in the know. But for lawyers at the Crown Prosecution Service, it's a red letter warning: the Human Rights Act is coming. Not that they needed it: CPS lawyers have been training for months in the run-up to the Act, which comes into force on October 2. Headed \"Speed Cameras\", the ad says cryptically: \"Identity of driver obtained under s172 RTA 1988 Human Rights Act. If you are advising clients in this area, please contact box A28/01.\" It's a signal that lawyers are poised to jump on a bandwagon already rolling in the Scottish courts, where they have been able to invoke the European Convention on Human Rights since the Scotland Act, bringing in Scottish devolution, became law a year ago. The result has been a year of surprises for the Scottish legal system. First, the high court in Edinburgh ruled that temporary sheriffs - senior lawyers who sit as judges part-time - were not an \"independent and impartial tribunal\" because renewal of their appointments was up to the Lord Advocate, a member of the executive. Accused whose cases were tried before them were therefore not guaranteed a fair trial. In February Scotland's appeal court declared that an important element of the police armoury against drink drivers was unusable. Margaret Brown, 30, was charged after police confronted her at 3am in a 24-hour supermarket smelling of alcohol and clutching a bottle of gin. Asked who had driven the car parked outside, she admitted: \"It was me.\" Section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 makes it an offence for the keeper of a car to refuse to identify the driver if asked by police. Parliament enacted it because a prosecution could not be brought without evidence that the person charged was driving the car. Her own admission was the key evidence that Brown had been driving while over the limit. Without it there would be no prosecution But the court ruled that article 6 of the European Convention, the right to a fair trial, protected her against self-incrimination. So the prosecution could not rely on it as a significant part of the case against her. At Brown's appeal hearing the then solicitor general, Colin Boyd, argued that without section 172, there could be \"momentous effects\" on the use of roadside cameras to trap speeding drivers, since prosecutions relied on the section for proof of the driver's identity. In his judgment, the Lord Justice General, Lord Rodger, left the question of speed traps open, but pointed out that the European Court of Human Rights had ruled that the protection against self-incrimination applied to \"all types of criminal offence without distinction, from the most simple to the most complex\". A senior Scottish judge, Lord McCluskey, burst into print in Scotland on Sunday a few days later, describing the results of the new human rights regime as \"devastating\". He said he had warned in his 1986 Reith lectures that the Canadian charter of rights and freedoms, modelled on the European Convention, would produce \"a field day for crackpots, a pain in the neck for judges and legislators, and a goldmine for lawyers.\" He added: \"Prophetic or what?\" Lord McCluskey predicted: \"The police are about to embark on a helter-skelter of discovery about the restraints upon their traditional powers and practices\". They should be looking \"long and hard\" at article 8 of the convention, which guarantees a right to privacy. It was a right enjoyed by everyone, including \"those whom the police are pursuing because they believe them to be drug dealers, fraudsters, paedophiles or wife-batterers\". The police could tap telephones, use secret cameras or engage in covert surveillance only if they had a valid warrant \"under a law which has been promulgated and publicised as a law designed to permit the invasion of article 8 privacy.\" It had been suggested, he said, that \"it was a bit like sailing in the Titanic toward a legal iceberg. My own fear is that the better simile is with an avalanche; all we can hear at the moment is a distant roar; but it is coming and we are going to have to struggle to avoid being buried in new claims of right.\" Within days, the judge's outburst had landed the Scottish courts with their own version of the Hoffmann debacle which had forced the House of Lords into an embarrassing re-hearing of the Pinochet case.

      "body": "<p>An IRA double murderer whistled in amazement yesterday. It all meant, he said, nothing less than the beginning of the IRA's dissolution. He added, with emphasis: \"The IRA is in liquidation.\"</p> <p>But Ulster Unionists were suspicious. They were poring over the IRA's dramatic statement on Saturday, examining it for caveats, and assessing the risks. They saw many, and were carefully constructing their credit and debit columns.</p> <p>But the Good Friday agreement, apparently close to expiration last week, may yet be roaring back towards a full and vigorous life. That now depends on the 860 delegates who make up the Ulster Unionist council, who will meet next Friday, May 20, to deliver their verdict.</p> <p>Persuade his ruling council to accept, and David Trimble will have sealed a political triumph which, even he privately admits, seemed well beyond his wildest dreams just days ago. Fail, and his five-year party leadership is over, and, with it, the agreement.</p> <p>None of the tumultuous twists of the peace-process rollercoaster has come close to what can be expected over the next fortnight. Unionism will be fighting in public, and it will be a fearsome battle.</p> <p>Last week the British and Irish governments damped down expectations as they struggled to find a way of sparking a return to devolution after Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, suspended Stormont's power-sharing executive and assembly on February 11. There was no talk of the hand of history or seismic shifts, just modest expressions of hope. It soon became clear a deal was there, with republicans having manoeuvred the IRA much more skilfully than before.</p> <p>Key in all of this is John Taylor, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionists. Tony Blair and Mr Mandelson concentrated much of their time on him, and they expect him now to back the deal. There may be a little encouragement, perhaps in the form of a pledge to keep the union flag flying from Stormont. It sounds minor enough to outsiders, but in Northern Ireland this is another of those vital symbolic points.</p> <p>Few outside the negotiations, which even saw Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness invited to Chequers, had anticipated the extent of the IRA statement when it appeared on Saturday. Even Mr Trimble's most virulent critics within his party grudgingly conceded that it represented an important shift.</p> <p>In the exact terms used earlier by both Mr Blair and Mr Mandelson, it said the IRA leadership would \"initiate a process that will completely and verifiably put IRA arms beyond use. We will do it in such a way as to avoid risk to the public and misappropriation by others and ensure maximum public confidence\".</p> <p><b> Confidence-building</b></p> <p>It also said: \"The IRA leadership has agreed to put in place within weeks a confidence-building measure to confirm that our weapons remain secure. The contents of a number of our arms dumps will be inspected by agreed third parties who will report that they have done so to the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. The dumps will be reinspected to ensure that the weapons have remained silent.\"</p> <p>The governments quickly announced that the former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, a veteran UN diplomat and EU envoy during the Kosovo crisis last year, would team up with Cyril Ramaphosa, one-time secretary general of the African National Congress, to inspect the dumps. Both are popular choices with republicans.</p> <p>The IRA move falls short of the kind of decommissioning unionists had hoped for: there will be no destruction of weapons. The IRA has also foisted off the agreement's May 22 deadline for the completion of decommissioning, with the governments agreeing to an extension because of the delays in setting up the executive and cross-border institutions last November. The new deadline will be in June next year.</p> <p>One sceptical member of the Ulster Unionist assembly team said yesterday: \"It is a vague statement. There is some hope in it. But the IRA keeps control of its weapons. There is complete spin going on as to what they are prepared to do.\"</p> <p>Mr Trimble, who met his assembly team on Saturday, will speak again with them tomorrow. He has so far lost two of his team, originally 20-strong, and at least one other is likely to follow. He is said to be taking the win-or-bust approach. His lieutenants know the council meeting, the fourth in six months, will be close.</p> <p>Mr Trimble defeated south Belfast MP Martin Smyth's leadership challenge two months ago with a slim margin, similar to the support he had six months ago for entering government with Sinn Fein before a start to IRA decommissioning. He is braced for an even tighter battle this time.</p> <p>One of Mr Trimble's advisers said yesterday: \"There are caveats. It is going to be a really slippery two weeks.</p> <p>\"It is not perfect. But what it does mean is that the IRA's posture with respect to the rest of society in Northern Ireland has been modified so that it is so much less threatening. If people get that into their guts, then everything is possible.\"</p> <p>The IRA's statement goes much further than Angel II, the failed initiative it put forward in February, and it is also markedly different from its dump arms order signalling the end of its six-year border campaign in 1962. Then it made it clear that the weapons were to be retained for future conflict.</p> <p>The two inspectors, who will work closely with General John de Chastelain, head of the decommissioning body, will arrive shortly to discuss modalities. Mr Trimble wants an early meeting.</p> <p>They will be allowed access to three substantial dumps, which will then be sealed in an as yet unspecified way, and it is believed that others will be opened to them over the next 12 months. But there will be no arms destruction at the end of that time.</p> <p>The IRA's proclamation is markedly different from recent defensive and petty statements. The confident language indicates republicans are at last adopting their familiar approach to difficulties, turning an intractable problem into triumph.</p> <p><b> Moral high ground</b></p> <p>The IRA can claim it has successfully foisted off decommissioning, at least on unionist terms, and paint the move as voluntary. It has wrested the moral high ground, leaving unionists the focus of worldwide opprobrium if they scorn the unprecedented offer.</p> <p>Ulster Unionists, though, now know they will be voting for the return as education minister of Mr McGuinness, the former IRA chief of staff, if they back the move. That appointment came as a surprise last time.</p> <p>The council has also linked a return to government to retention of the RUC name, with a concession - though relatively minor - expected.</p> <p>A government minister said last night: \"This is as good as it gets. This is it for the agreement. Those who want it to work will back it. For those who don't, nothing would persuade them otherwise.\"</p> <p>A leading republican, who believed the IRA would suffer few defections despite internal ructions, said the movement had nowhere else to go. The collapse of the agreement would have signalled that the Adams-McGuinness strategy of 15 years had been a mistake.</p> <p>\"The deal allows unionists to claims there is decommissioning, and us to claim that there is not,\" he said. \"It is an honourable compromise. No one has won.</p> <p>\"What more do they want? I suspect the wilder elements within unionism would not be happy even if the IRA's leaders were led out and publicly executed.\"</p>",

He added, with emphasis: \"The IRA is in liquidation.\" But Ulster Unionists were suspicious. They were poring over the IRA's dramatic statement on Saturday, examining it for caveats, and assessing the risks. They saw many, and were carefully constructing their credit and debit columns. But the Good Friday agreement, apparently close to expiration last week, may yet be roaring back towards a full and vigorous life. That now depends on the 860 delegates who make up the Ulster Unionist council, who will meet next Friday, May 20, to deliver their verdict. Persuade his ruling council to accept, and David Trimble will have sealed a political triumph which, even he privately admits, seemed well beyond his wildest dreams just days ago. Fail, and his five-year party leadership is over, and, with it, the agreement. None of the tumultuous twists of the peace-process rollercoaster has come close to what can be expected over the next fortnight. Unionism will be fighting in public, and it will be a fearsome battle. Last week the British and Irish governments damped down expectations as they struggled to find a way of sparking a return to devolution after Peter Mandelson, the Northern Ireland secretary, suspended Stormont's power-sharing executive and assembly on February 11. There was no talk of the hand of history or seismic shifts, just modest expressions of hope. It soon became clear a deal was there, with republicans having manoeuvred the IRA much more skilfully than before. Key in all of this is John Taylor, deputy leader of the Ulster Unionists. Tony Blair and Mr Mandelson concentrated much of their time on him, and they expect him now to back the deal. There may be a little encouragement, perhaps in the form of a pledge to keep the union flag flying from Stormont. It sounds minor enough to outsiders, but in Northern Ireland this is another of those vital symbolic points. Few outside the negotiations, which even saw Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness invited to Chequers, had anticipated the extent of the IRA statement when it appeared on Saturday. Even Mr Trimble's most virulent critics within his party grudgingly conceded that it represented an important shift. In the exact terms used earlier by both Mr Blair and Mr Mandelson, it said the IRA leadership would \"initiate a process that will completely and verifiably put IRA arms beyond use. We will do it in such a way as to avoid risk to the public and misappropriation by others and ensure maximum public confidence\". Confidence-building It also said: \"The IRA leadership has agreed to put in place within weeks a confidence-building measure to confirm that our weapons remain secure. The contents of a number of our arms dumps will be inspected by agreed third parties who will report that they have done so to the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. The dumps will be reinspected to ensure that the weapons have remained silent.\" The governments quickly announced that the former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, a veteran UN diplomat and EU envoy during the Kosovo crisis last year, would team up with Cyril Ramaphosa, one-time secretary general of the African National Congress, to inspect the dumps. Both are popular choices with republicans. The IRA move falls short of the kind of decommissioning unionists had hoped for: there will be no destruction of weapons. The IRA has also foisted off the agreement's May 22 deadline for the completion of decommissioning, with the governments agreeing to an extension because of the delays in setting up the executive and cross-border institutions last November. The new deadline will be in June next year. One sceptical member of the Ulster Unionist assembly team said yesterday: \"It is a vague statement. There is some hope in it. But the IRA keeps control of its weapons. There is complete spin going on as to what they are prepared to do.\" Mr Trimble, who met his assembly team on Saturday, will speak again with them tomorrow. He has so far lost two of his team, originally 20-strong, and at least one other is likely to follow. He is said to be taking the win-or-bust approach. His lieutenants know the council meeting, the fourth in six months, will be close. Mr Trimble defeated south Belfast MP Martin Smyth's leadership challenge two months ago with a slim margin, similar to the support he had six months ago for entering government with Sinn Fein before a start to IRA decommissioning. He is braced for an even tighter battle this time. One of Mr Trimble's advisers said yesterday: \"There are caveats. It is going to be a really slippery two weeks. \"It is not perfect. But what it does mean is that the IRA's posture with respect to the rest of society in Northern Ireland has been modified so that it is so much less threatening. If people get that into their guts, then everything is possible.\" The IRA's statement goes much further than Angel II, the failed initiative it put forward in February, and it is also markedly different from its dump arms order signalling the end of its six-year border campaign in 1962. Then it made it clear that the weapons were to be retained for future conflict. The two inspectors, who will work closely with General John de Chastelain, head of the decommissioning body, will arrive shortly to discuss modalities. Mr Trimble wants an early meeting. They will be allowed access to three substantial dumps, which will then be sealed in an as yet unspecified way, and it is believed that others will be opened to them over the next 12 months. But there will be no arms destruction at the end of that time. The IRA's proclamation is markedly different from recent defensive and petty statements. The confident language indicates republicans are at last adopting their familiar approach to difficulties, turning an intractable problem into triumph. Moral high ground The IRA can claim it has successfully foisted off decommissioning, at least on unionist terms, and paint the move as voluntary. It has wrested the moral high ground, leaving unionists the focus of worldwide opprobrium if they scorn the unprecedented offer. Ulster Unionists, though, now know they will be voting for the return as education minister of Mr McGuinness, the former IRA chief of staff, if they back the move. That appointment came as a surprise last time. The council has also linked a return to government to retention of the RUC name, with a concession - though relatively minor - expected. A government minister said last night: \"This is as good as it gets. This is it for the agreement. Those who want it to work will back it. For those who don't, nothing would persuade them otherwise.\" A leading republican, who believed the IRA would suffer few defections despite internal ructions, said the movement had nowhere else to go. The collapse of the agreement would have signalled that the Adams-McGuinness strategy of 15 years had been a mistake. \"The deal allows unionists to claims there is decommissioning, and us to claim that there is not,\" he said. \"It is an honourable compromise. No one has won. \"What more do they want? I suspect the wilder elements within unionism would not be happy even if the IRA's leaders were led out and publicly executed.\"",

      "bodyText": "The CIA is nearing completion of a secret report for President Bill Clinton on the state of European political and public opinion towards Washington's controversial plan for a national missile defence shield. Mr Clinton will decide this summer whether to give the go-ahead to the shield - dubbed the \"son of star wars\" - for which planning and testing are almost finished. \"We are looking at reactions in different countries, allies as well as potential enemies,\" Robert Walpole, the top US inteligence officer dealing with missile defence, told journalists in Huntsville, Alabama. Mr Walpole said he believed Europeans were less convinced than Americans that the threat of an attack on the US by \"rogue states\" such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq, was a credible one. France, in particular, was sceptical. But opinion could change, he said, when Europeans became more aware that Iran would shortly be able to develop an intermediate range missile capable of hitting any country in Europe, but not the US. \"US allies are going to be the first to be targeted. A range of 4,000 kilometres [2,500 miles] would give them [Iran] most of Europe,\" he said. Assessments by the CIA show that Iran has the capability to develop larger missile systems than the Shahab-3, which has already been tested. It could be in a position to upgrade to an inter-continental ballistic missile system capable of hitting the US by 2010. \"We assess these capabilities as indicative of intentions to develop longer-range missiles and space launch vehicles,\" Mr Walpole said. The US plan for a 100-interceptor missile defence shield would not protect Europe against a missile attack from Iran. \"Our interceptors simply don't have the legs,\" said Keith Englander, a senior Pentagon missile planner. The CIA's warnings come as the US military prepares for a crucial test next month in which a prototype interceptor rocket will again attempt to shoot down a test missile over the Pacific. The test on June 26 will be the third intercept attempt. A first test last year was successful, but a second this year was not, though the scientists claim to have fixed the cooling system failure which they say caused the interceptor to miss the incoming missile by about 100 metres. The US tests involve an attack missile launched from Vandenberg air force base in California and an interceptor fired from Kwajalein atoll in the Marshall islands. \"I am confident this system works.

If, as expected, Mr Clinton approves the system, the US will be able to deploy 20 interceptors at Fort Greeley, Alaska, by the end of 2005, and the remaining 80 by the end of 2007, Mr Englander said. The initial deployment also involves the construction of two x-band radar sites in North Dakota and one on Shemya island off the Alaska coast. Five other early-warning radar sites, including Fylingdales in Yorkshire to detect missiles from the Middle East, and another at Thule in Greenland, would require upgrading. Gen Costello made clear that the initial 100 interceptor missiles under discussion by the Pentagon are likely to be only the start. \"The growth of the rogue nation threat would lead you to consider more ground-based interceptors,\" as well as sea-and space-based options, he said. A central political difficulty for Mr Clinton is that a decision to deploy the national missile shield would violate the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty between the US and Russia. The treaty rules out the building of national missile defence systems, on the grounds that they would upset the nuclear balance. Washington's push to amend the ABM treaty is expected to dominate Mr Clinton's first summit with President Vladimir Putin next month. Colonel-General Leonid Ivashev, head of the Russian armed forces' diplomatic service, last week accused the US of dishonesty in claiming its plans were aimed solely at \"rogue\" states such as North Korea. \"These [US] proposals are not constructive and cannot be a subject of further consultations,\" Gen Ivashev said. \"What is actually meant here is a system with such control and target-acquisition means, including space-based, which can easily be expanded by a simple increase in the number of anti-missiles.\" America's European allies are also deeply sceptical about the US project.

The case has all the ingredients of an international thriller - mysteriously missing oil rigs, an alleged attempt to strangle the Russian ambassador to Nigeria, and claims of sightings of headless corpses floating down the country's Sapele river. Ms Booth represents Chief Humphrey Idisi and his companies, Lonestar Drilling Nigeria Ltd and Lonestar Overseas Limited. He is trying to persuade the court of appeal to set aside a high court judgment against him, obtained by a Ukrainian shipping firm without a trial. In 1997 Lonestar bought two secondhand oil rigs in India, which the shipping firm, Gulf Azov, agreed to send to Sapele on its vessel the Dubai Valour. But when the ship arrived vital parts were missing from the oil rigs.

Gulf Azov and its insurers also sued Lonestar for $8m damages concerning the boat and wrongful arrest. In November Mr Justice Langley gave judgment for Gulf Azov, without a trial, with damages to be assessed. Courts can give judgment without a hearing if satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect of the defendants establishing a defence. In papers filed for the appeal, Chief Idisi's lawyers argued that Gulf Azov's allegations against him included \"torture and crimes against humanity\", statements making it unfair to pass judgment without trial. Gulf Azov claims that the boat's crew were starved of food and had to sell their watches for water, that armed guards from Lonestar prevented supplies being delivered to the vessel, and that Chief Idisi tried to strangle the Russian ambassador to Nigeria and the claimants' lawyers.

      "body": "<p>Tolstoy can't have known, when writing a novel back in the 1870s, that trains rushing into tunnels would become a cinematic euphemism for sex. But his book about a Moscow political wife's passion for a soldier - in which the speed of trains is a metaphor for the dangers and consequences of sexual passion - has consistently attracted film-makers. David Selznick cast Garbo in 1935, while Alexander Korda chose Vivien Leigh for the role in 1947. More recently, the writer-director Bernard Rose made a movie version with Sophie Marceau. Now Helen McCrory stars in a new four-part TV adaptation of Anna Karenina (Tuesday, 9pm, Channel 4). </p> <p>Penelope Fitzgerald - a fine novelist who died last week - once expressed the hope that television would soon run out of great novels to adapt, and return literature to readers. But, although there are the inevitable losses - authorial tone and psychological complexity - Anna Karenina is, at the basic but crucial level of plot, the perfect book for TV. </p> <p>Among the great novels, Anna Karenina is, action terms, the closest to soap opera. Not simply because the central themes of adultery and the destiny of a child are the main narrative motors of the daily serial, but because the tragic events develop from relationships within a family. </p> <p>The book begins with a sister-in-law coming home to sort out a family crisis but in fact complicating the arrangements by stealing her sister's suitor. Tolstoy's plot has been unconsciously borrowed on numerous occasions by every soap opera from Coronation Street to Dallas. In EastEnders, the Mitchell brothers would frequently growl: \"It's family.\" The Russian equivalent might be spoken at several points in this story. </p> <p>The Russian landscape and the Russian language are both so capacious and distinctive that the risk with adaptations of Anna Karenina is that they will be visually over-nourished but (because of the difficulties of translation) verbally under-fed. With Poland standing in for Russia, this version (directed by David Blair) looks stunning - at a key moment, Karenin sees tracks in a rolling snowscape - but takes its biggest risks with the script. </p> <p>Although Karenin speaks with a college pedantry which establishes his emotional coldness, writer Alan Cubitt generally uses brisk, idiomatic English of a kind often heard in Albert Square or Brookside Close: \"I'm all ears\"; \"You should know there's talk\". At the horse race where Anna's concern for Vronsky becomes public, a punter with a race card asks: \"Who do you fancy?\" Like Alan Bleasdale in his recent ITV Oliver Twist, Cubitt is keener on a script with kick than footnotes. </p> <p>This approach will certainly draw audiences. Critics and academics will question how much of Tolstoy's sensibility survives. It's the third major infidelity novel to come to the screen in the last few months, along with BBC2's recent Madame Bovary and Neil Jordan's film of Greene's The End Of The Affair. The taking of lovers has always been fiction's most popular plot, but directors and producers are perhaps drawn to these classic triangles at the moment because of high levels of divorce and fragmentation of families. </p> <p>But, although the central events invite contemporary identification, the original authorial attitudes may have dated - especially Tolstoy's idiosyncratic religious moralism. In the new visualisations of Madame Bovary, The End Of The Affair and now Anna Karenina, stories of social scandal - a woman risking status and reputation - have undergone at least some degree of feminist renovation. It's explicitly shown that orgasm is the reward (perhaps even the justification) for the risks Emma and Anna take. In interviews, Stephen Dillane, who plays Karenin, has stressed the dignity and decency of this apparently sinister man. But this isn't how it will play to most contemporary viewers. Karenin - like Dr Bovary in the recent TV version - seeds the tragedy by being bad in bed. </p> <p>The danger of this emphasis is that it might trivialise the book, implying that the story might have become a novella with a happy ending if Anna had left a few copies of the Moscow edition of Cosmopolitan on her husband's bedside table. But it's a sensible decision for a peak-time audience in the year 2000, which will respond more to a central character who is a victim of erotic inequality than of social shame. </p> <p>In fact, though heavily publicised (as was Madame Bovary) on its sexual content, this Anna Karenina is more explicit to the ear (the ecstatic breathlessness of lovers) than the eye. The first episode opens with a trick image of physicality - steamed windows, a naked male back rising and falling - which is revealed to be Levin (Douglas Henshall) exercising, in a routine somewhere between a work-out and a crucifixion, before pressing his suit with Kitty. Anna's first dangerous afternoon with Vronsky is shot in fragmented soft focus. </p> <p>Channel 4 is a rare entrant to a classic serial field dominated by the BBC, and what's impressive is that you never feel that Lord Reith's grandson is itching uncomfortably in the old man's suit. The style feels freer, younger, moulded to the network. Advertisers should be happy with it, although it would perhaps be tactful not to approach Virgin Trains. If they'd held the St Petersburg-Moscow franchise in 1878, Anna and Vronsky might never have met.</p>",

It's explicitly shown that orgasm is the reward (perhaps even the justification) for the risks Emma and Anna take. In interviews, Stephen Dillane, who plays Karenin, has stressed the dignity and decency of this apparently sinister man. But this isn't how it will play to most contemporary viewers. Karenin - like Dr Bovary in the recent TV version - seeds the tragedy by being bad in bed. The danger of this emphasis is that it might trivialise the book, implying that the story might have become a novella with a happy ending if Anna had left a few copies of the Moscow edition of Cosmopolitan on her husband's bedside table. But it's a sensible decision for a peak-time audience in the year 2000, which will respond more to a central character who is a victim of erotic inequality than of social shame. In fact, though heavily publicised (as was Madame Bovary) on its sexual content, this Anna Karenina is more explicit to the ear (the ecstatic breathlessness of lovers) than the eye. The first episode opens with a trick image of physicality - steamed windows, a naked male back rising and falling - which is revealed to be Levin (Douglas Henshall) exercising, in a routine somewhere between a work-out and a crucifixion, before pressing his suit with Kitty. Anna's first dangerous afternoon with Vronsky is shot in fragmented soft focus. Channel 4 is a rare entrant to a classic serial field dominated by the BBC, and what's impressive is that you never feel that Lord Reith's grandson is itching uncomfortably in the old man's suit. The style feels freer, younger, moulded to the network. Advertisers should be happy with it, although it would perhaps be tactful not to approach Virgin Trains. If they'd held the St Petersburg-Moscow franchise in 1878, Anna and Vronsky might never have met.",

He, and the surviving cast, managed with magnificent aplomb, sending Compo to meet his maker in a coffin garnished with Wellington boots. Peter Sallis (Clegg) and Frank Thornton (Truly) made a downbeat double-act of mourning, while the chorus of comic women (Kathy Staff, Thora Hird, Jean Alexander) was swelled by the addition of Liz Fraser as Reggie, Compo's secret girlfriend. Of course there were lapses into mushiness (not least the egregious version of the theme tune, with lyrics promising to \"salute his summer wine\"), but the laughs were never far behind.

      "bodyText": "For the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, the former British West African colony of Sierra Leone has been a problem almost from the word \"go\". In his first year in office, Mr Cook fought to survive a parliamentary inquiry into Sierra Leone sanctions-busting, with alleged Foreign Office connivance, by a British firm of mercenaries called Sandline. The country's civil war has constantly - and embarrassingly - underscored the limits of British and Commonwealth ability to influence events. Widespread atrocities, in particular gruesome mutilations and child sex slavery rackets undertaken by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels, caused public revulsion which Mr Cook was powerless to assuage. The peace deal worked out with British help and signed in Togo last July was criticised for effectively pardoning the RUF leader, Foday Sankoh, and his cronies for their numerous crimes. Indeed, Mr Sankoh was rewarded with the post of vice-president. Many felt the RUF leaders should have been brought before a war crimes tribunal, as in Rwanda after the 1994 genocide. But Britain went along with the fix. Nor did the Togo accord make proper provision for the many refugees - some say as many as 3m people have been displaced - and RUF fighters would regularly hijack food aid convoys. Africa watchers warned last year that Mr Sankoh would not honour the Togo deal. When the UN began to deploy last December, replac ing a Nigerian-led West African force, it rapidly became clear that the demobilisation camps at which RUF fighters were expected to disarm would be impossible to organise. Disputes developed over UN \"incursions\" into RUF-held territory, especially the diamond-producing areas which hold the key to Sierra Leone's wealth - and its misery. Now, as the UN peacekeeping mission appears to be losing control of the situation, and amid desperate appeals from Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, Mr Cook and Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, have decided to send in 700 British paratroopers. But, Whitehall was at pains to stress, the deployment is only to secure any evacuation of European Union, US and other foreign nationals. Even though the predominantly African, Indian-led UN force is involved in direct combat with the RUF rebels, Britain's soldiers are under orders not to get involved. There will be no East Timor-style peace enforcement or Kosovo-like talk of moral principle, whatever the possible toll in local civilian lives. For Mr Cook, who prides himself on a pro-active foreign policy, this all falls far short of glorious. The US has also ordered its nationals to leave Sierra Leone and may send soldiers to secure Freetown airport.

But if the Sierra Leone mission collapses in ignominy, the chances of a Congo force will recede rapidly. While Mr Cook clearly hopes to avoid further embarrassment over Sierra Leone, it is now highly possible that the British paras may get caught up in the fighting. They will hardly surrender.

      "byline": "Kate Connolly",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Vera Bila took to the stage for a fee-paying audience for the first time six years ago, she could not believe what happened. \"They started clapping, and I hadn't even reached the microphone,\" says the corpulent Romany diva, one eyebrow raised while she indulges in an ice-cream that smudges her shiny skin. \"I was convinced they wouldn't like me, and sometimes I still get that feeling.\" </p> <p>Her fears are not altogether unfounded. She is, after all, a Gypsy singer who hails from a country where racist attacks on Gypsies (or Roma) have more than doubled in the past 10 years, and where the sum of Gypsy culture is widely viewed as pickpocketing and late-night carousing to deliberately starve their worker neighbours of sleep. </p> <p>Since the Czech folk singer Zuzana Navarova discovered Vera Bila and her band Kale (which translates as Vera White and the Blacks), Bila has become the Czech Republic's most important musician abroad and possibly the world's most popular Romany singer. Her music, which she composes with the relatives and friends who make up the band, is a homespun melange of occidental pop and Latin sensuality. Add flamenco and the influence of the Beatles and the Bee Gees and you get the unique blend that Bila calls Roma Pop. </p> <p>There is something anarchistic in the way occasionally off-key singing is an accepted part of the show, particularly if the band are out of sorts or not being paid as much as they think they deserve. And there is something distant and untouchable about Bila, who sings in a language few understand about a way of life few know. The music sums up the complex character of the wild and passionate Roma: when the music is effervescent and apparently overflowing with joie de vivre, the sparse lyrics lean in totally the opposite direction - mournful, tragic, melancholic. \"My hurt is aching, my mother has passed away.

      "bodyText": "When Vera Bila took to the stage for a fee-paying audience for the first time six years ago, she could not believe what happened. \"They started clapping, and I hadn't even reached the microphone,\" says the corpulent Romany diva, one eyebrow raised while she indulges in an ice-cream that smudges her shiny skin. \"I was convinced they wouldn't like me, and sometimes I still get that feeling.\" Her fears are not altogether unfounded. She is, after all, a Gypsy singer who hails from a country where racist attacks on Gypsies (or Roma) have more than doubled in the past 10 years, and where the sum of Gypsy culture is widely viewed as pickpocketing and late-night carousing to deliberately starve their worker neighbours of sleep. Since the Czech folk singer Zuzana Navarova discovered Vera Bila and her band Kale (which translates as Vera White and the Blacks), Bila has become the Czech Republic's most important musician abroad and possibly the world's most popular Romany singer. Her music, which she composes with the relatives and friends who make up the band, is a homespun melange of occidental pop and Latin sensuality. Add flamenco and the influence of the Beatles and the Bee Gees and you get the unique blend that Bila calls Roma Pop. There is something anarchistic in the way occasionally off-key singing is an accepted part of the show, particularly if the band are out of sorts or not being paid as much as they think they deserve. And there is something distant and untouchable about Bila, who sings in a language few understand about a way of life few know. The music sums up the complex character of the wild and passionate Roma: when the music is effervescent and apparently overflowing with joie de vivre, the sparse lyrics lean in totally the opposite direction - mournful, tragic, melancholic. \"My hurt is aching, my mother has passed away. I've been abandoned with my father,\" is a typical lament. Other perennial themes include begging, the value of bread, disappointment in love and imprisonment. Her popularity has taken Bila to America and venues throughout Europe; on Saturday she will be playing the Barbican as part of the 1000 Year Journey festival.

But when they do make their presence known, how they invigorate streets and skylines. The Eiffel Tower. The Pompidou Centre. Lloyd's of London. Trams. Chicago's \"L\", the elevated railroad that rattles like some gigantic model train set around the heart of the windy city. Docks with their cranes and gantries. Power stations. Ocean-going ships berthed beside midtown skyscrapers. The London Eye. </p> <p>All these happily intrusive designs and structures are heroic things. All catch the eye and stir the soul. Most are despised by the disgusteds of Tunbridge Wells, who prefer a nice bit of neo-geo brickwork, an executive cul-de-sac or a postmodern shopping arcade with split pediments, herringbone brick-tiled floors and brass-veneered handrails. </p> <p>One of the most unexpected of new city machines is the mellifluously named Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Centre for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The suddenness, the crispness of this machine for exploring the stars contrast sharply with its lugubrious appellation. The Rose Centre (for short) is a wonderful surprise, launching out of 81st St where it meets Central Park West, a few blocks north of the Addams Family-style Dakota Building where John Lennon died. It stands, foursquare, a box of white-painted steel and glass encasing what appears to be a planet. It lights up spectacularly at night. It is a superb foil to the heavy-handed turn-of-the-century architecture of the existing museum and to the bravura apartment blocks that line these gung-ho streets and imposing avenues. Queues form around this, New York's newest museum, like the rings around some mysterious planet. </p> <p>The Rose Centre is the first challenging and adventurous new building New York has seen in far too long. Over the past 20 years the city that gave the world the Empire State and Chrysler buildings and the Rockefeller Centre seems to have given up the architectural ghost. Play it safe. Keep it low and dull (I mean \"contextual\"). And yet if any city has benefited from structural heroism, it is New York. The $210m Rose Centre is a brave building, yet compared with, say, Lloyd's or the Pompidou Centre, it is neat and well mannered, an 87ft diameter sphere, a hi-tech planetarium within a 120ft glass cube. </p> <p>The architects are the New York-based Polshek Partnership, currently working on the Santa Fe Opera in New Mexico and the William Jefferson Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas. They have drawn on sources old and new, from such heroic unbuilt projects as Etienne-Louis Boullee's cenotaph to Newton, designed late in the 18th century, through the great Perisphere built for the 1939 New York World's Fair, to the work of the hi-tech architects of today: Norman Foster, Richard Rogers, Jean Nouvel and Nicholas Grimshaw are all echoed, whether as faintly as a distant star or as clearly as a space shuttle shooting heavenwards. </p> <p>The transparency of the building, says James Stewart Polshek, \"makes a clear statement about the accessibility of scientific inquiry and our faith in the future. What I had originally conceived of as an iconic scientific tool evolved into a 'cosmic cathedral', an intensely memorable spatial experience that is intended to awe and inspire visitors and to expand their understanding of the wonders of our universe.\" </p> <p>Polshek's cosmic cathedral is a steel-framed glazed box rising from a granite base. It is entered through a trio of swivelling glass doors and is immediately bright, airy and well planned. The sphere at its centre is supported by tubes that double up as walkways, entrances and exits. Floors are made to sparkle like starscapes. A 17ft-diameter model of Saturn appears to orbit the great sphere. Despite the surrounding displays, visitors want to get inside the planetarium sphere as soon as they are able. This is a simple architectural statement, yet quite breathtaking. </p> <p>It is even more impressive by night, when the sphere appears to float in darkness. During the day, its mysteries are best experienced inside the darkness of the planetarium sphere. The shows offer a 3D trip through space and time into the origins (as far as anyone knows) of the universe. The clever thing about the Rose Center is that, although it is a sensational experience in its own right, it is not cut off from the rest of the museum. It acts, according to its architects, as a \"critical bridge for the museum\" by linking \"immersive environments about the nature of the universe and of our planet\" to the museum's 42 permanent exhibition halls, which explore the diversity and history of life on Earth and human culture. Nevertheless, its striking architecture and design have clearly made the new wing of the museum the tail that wags the dog star of this 131-year-old, 20-acre institution. </p> <p> For one thing, the Rose Centre is big - a quarter of the size of the existing museum. For a second and third, the shows presented in the top and bottom halves of the planetarium or Hayden Sphere are unforgettable. On top is Passport to the Universe, narrated by Tom Hanks; down below is Big Bang, with Jodie Foster doing the honours. Both offer what must be the most convincing journeys through the universe yet taken by earthbound mortals. The virtual universe experienced here is based on astronomical observations and computer models of our galaxy from Nasa, including the Hubble space telescope. It even amazes New York's streetwise, gum-chewing lines of schoolkids who snake through the great arched granite entrance from a new park on 81st St and wind their way up the ramps to the Hayden Sphere. </p> <p>On their way they can divert through permanent installations outside the sphere that explain how stars are born, what a black hole is and our place in the cosmos. By and large these are well done, although most children under about 60 seem to have the attention span of absent-minded gnats: they press the buttons and move on before they have to absorb any knowledge. </p> <p>Midway through Passport to the Universe, a disembodied Tom Hanks urges the audience to take a deep breath. \"Really,\" he says. \"Everybody do it. Every atom of oxygen you just inhaled was made deep inside a star. The carbon in our muscles, the calcium in our bones, the iron in our blood - in fact, all the heavy elements - were cooked in the heart of stars. As Carl Sagan said, 'We are starstuff'.\" Just like the Rose Centre.</p>",

      "byline": "Marcel Berlins",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Last week, the United States supreme court ruled, to the jubilation of American internet service providers, that they could not be held legally responsible for libels which appeared on their sites. A few weeks before that, in England, the service provider Demon paid out \u00a315,000 plus legal costs to lecturer and physicist Laurence Godfrey for a libel on one of Demon's bulletin boards, following a high court judge's ruling last year to the effect that Demon was a \"publisher\" of the offending material and therefore could be legally responsible. The divergence between the US approach - with its far greater emphasis on freedom of expression - and the English, usually anxious to protect individual reputations, is interesting.</p> <p>But what I'm more concerned is that neither result seems at all satisfactory. Under the American rationale - which treats the internet a bit like a phone line, as a mere transmitter but not a publisher - anyone, anywhere will be able to put anything on the net (not just libel but, presumably, pornography as well) and the service provider can sit back secure in its immunity. But the English solution has its drawbacks too.</p> <p>It's based on the duty of the service provider to act once an alleged libel has been drawn to its attention and it's been asked to remove it. If it doesn't - as Demon didn't in the Godfrey case - it becomes liable. The consequence of that approach is that the service provider, to save itself the trouble of looking into the merits of every request for removal, will simply accede to all of them. I can't see AOL or whoever having a team of lawyers to assess whether or not the alleged libel has any validity. So it will be open to anyone who doesn't like what's being said about him or her to write a simple letter of warning to the service provider - maybe even a lawyer's phone call will be enough - knowing that the offending stuff will be removed.</p> <p>In the old days there was a nasty device called the gagging writ, which stopped all unfavourable mention of the complaining party once legal proceedings had been started (Robert Maxwell was a great exponent of it), but the modern internet version is worse, because it is so much easier. You don't even need to issue any formal proceedings, just make the call or send the letter. I'm not blaming the provider for its meek attitude - why should they spend large sums of money investigating every idiotic demand so as to weed out the chancers from the genuinely libelled? But anecdotes are accumulating which make me uneasy. For instance, Kamlesh Bahl, the former Law Society vice-president, opened a website to put her side of the controversy which had led to her resignation. Someone - I don't know who - complained that it contained defamatory material. I don't know whether it did or not but its removal is not good news for freedom of speech.</p> <p>While I'm on the oddities of libel, a Manchester law firm, Rowe and Cohen, has achieved what I think is a British legal first - an apology on a billboard. They managed this because the original libel was also on a billboard - promoting the Cumbrian News and Star by reprinting a front page which happened to have a large headline libelling the local MP, David MacLean. The newspaper ran an apology in its own pages, but agreed also to advertise on billboards: \"Apology to MP MacLean over a report on drugs test\".</p> <p>The excellent appointment of Sir Richard Scott as a law lord makes the cultural-geographical balance of the highest court even more extraordinary. He too, has South African roots, which means that, with Lords Steyn and Hoffmann, a quarter of the court originates from a country which doesn't even have the same system of law as the House of Lords. That's a remarkable proportion. Only six - half - of the law lords are now English, two are Scottish and one is from Northern Ireland.

      "bodyText": "Last week, the United States supreme court ruled, to the jubilation of American internet service providers, that they could not be held legally responsible for libels which appeared on their sites. A few weeks before that, in England, the service provider Demon paid out \u00a315,000 plus legal costs to lecturer and physicist Laurence Godfrey for a libel on one of Demon's bulletin boards, following a high court judge's ruling last year to the effect that Demon was a \"publisher\" of the offending material and therefore could be legally responsible. The divergence between the US approach - with its far greater emphasis on freedom of expression - and the English, usually anxious to protect individual reputations, is interesting. But what I'm more concerned is that neither result seems at all satisfactory. Under the American rationale - which treats the internet a bit like a phone line, as a mere transmitter but not a publisher - anyone, anywhere will be able to put anything on the net (not just libel but, presumably, pornography as well) and the service provider can sit back secure in its immunity. But the English solution has its drawbacks too. It's based on the duty of the service provider to act once an alleged libel has been drawn to its attention and it's been asked to remove it. If it doesn't - as Demon didn't in the Godfrey case - it becomes liable. The consequence of that approach is that the service provider, to save itself the trouble of looking into the merits of every request for removal, will simply accede to all of them. I can't see AOL or whoever having a team of lawyers to assess whether or not the alleged libel has any validity. So it will be open to anyone who doesn't like what's being said about him or her to write a simple letter of warning to the service provider - maybe even a lawyer's phone call will be enough - knowing that the offending stuff will be removed. In the old days there was a nasty device called the gagging writ, which stopped all unfavourable mention of the complaining party once legal proceedings had been started (Robert Maxwell was a great exponent of it), but the modern internet version is worse, because it is so much easier. You don't even need to issue any formal proceedings, just make the call or send the letter. I'm not blaming the provider for its meek attitude - why should they spend large sums of money investigating every idiotic demand so as to weed out the chancers from the genuinely libelled? But anecdotes are accumulating which make me uneasy. For instance, Kamlesh Bahl, the former Law Society vice-president, opened a website to put her side of the controversy which had led to her resignation. Someone - I don't know who - complained that it contained defamatory material. I don't know whether it did or not but its removal is not good news for freedom of speech. While I'm on the oddities of libel, a Manchester law firm, Rowe and Cohen, has achieved what I think is a British legal first - an apology on a billboard. They managed this because the original libel was also on a billboard - promoting the Cumbrian News and Star by reprinting a front page which happened to have a large headline libelling the local MP, David MacLean. The newspaper ran an apology in its own pages, but agreed also to advertise on billboards: \"Apology to MP MacLean over a report on drugs test\". The excellent appointment of Sir Richard Scott as a law lord makes the cultural-geographical balance of the highest court even more extraordinary. He too, has South African roots, which means that, with Lords Steyn and Hoffmann, a quarter of the court originates from a country which doesn't even have the same system of law as the House of Lords. That's a remarkable proportion. Only six - half - of the law lords are now English, two are Scottish and one is from Northern Ireland. Scott is admittedly not quite as South African as Hoffmann and Steyn. He has no long family history in the country, but his early life was there, including school and university, so he definitely qualifies, even if, unlike the other two, he's lost his accent. Legal Blunders (Robinson Publishers), by Geoff Tibbals, is one of those entertaining compilations of things that go wrong in the law, risible incompetence, cock-ups etc, although this one is better than most because it deals also with some of the more serious miscarriages of justice. Helena Kennedy QC writes an introduction, to which I am indebted for the following.

In 1969, cutting-edge style magazine Nova interviewed 100 women - all achievers in their chosen field and often the first of their gender to do so - about the issues that intimately concerned them as women. What bothered them about Britain: abortion, the pill, education, marriage? The results provided a snapshot of a generation awakening, brought up in the feminine tradition but gradually, gladly, articulating a new language of sexual agency, economic choice and social alternatives.</p> <p>Fast-forward across three decades that have witnessed the most significant shifts in women's status of the last century, to 100 different women and five different issues. What bothers us about Britain today: sex, drugs, race, politics, success?</p> <p>There are inevitable differences. The explosion of opportunity has made some of us, but not all, more liberal in outlook, more left-leaning in our politics. The persistence of certain fundamental inequalities has left some bleak, but most of us wiser in the fight. We are proud to bring to our workplace, our lover, our family, the distinctive life experience of being born female; we easily word \"I want\", \"I believe\", \"I desire\".</p> <p>Many of the women featured on these pages have reaped the benefits of the practical feminism espoused by those original Nova pioneers. As girls, their educational needs were taken seriously and they were encouraged to consider college and career. In relationships, they enjoyed free access to abortion and contraception. In work, equality of salary and opportunity were legislated for. Many of these women entered the workplace expecting it to be equal. The spectre of the lipsticky 80s power-bitch is all but excised: it's no longer about joining the boys' club and it's not a competition. But the pay gap still has plenty spitting blood, while for many it is becoming a mother, rather than being a woman, that proves the flashpoint for gender injustice.</p> <p>\"What is it that still locks women out of power?\" writer Natasha Walter says. \"I dream of living in a country where women could reach freely for power and men would take an equal share in domestic and caring work.\"</p> <p>But beyond the structural inequalities that militate against working mothers, there is another debate about the nature of power itself. There's still concern among older women about \"man in a frock\" syndrome, but according to Shirley Conran (who was also interviewed in 1969), women just won't accept that power is important. \"Women still tend to think power is a nasty, masculine, unfeminine thing and they don't need it. Whereas power is what was called in the nursery getting your own way - and every woman wants that.\"</p> <p>\"Many women don't want to pay the price of ambition,\" argues Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of Sane. \"They don't want to lead such a one-dimensional life. Relationships count more for them. And for others it's that very emotional literacy that makes women an asset in the workplace.\"</p> <p>\"In today's world, the qualities that drive business success are classically feminine: nurturing, gut instinct, people skills. It's part of the feminisation of the workplace,\" says Tamara Ingram, chief executive of Saatchi.</p> <p>Even so, a residue of old school prejudice remains. \"I hate it when people think a woman's got to the top because she's somehow not a real woman,\" says boxer Jane Couch. \"If you're a woman in a position of power, they question your sexuality. People should say: are you doing the job properly? If you are, whether you are a man or a woman isn't relevant.\"</p> <p>Given the strength of feeling on working motherhood, it's only fair that the government's childcare policy gets a tick from these women. That's unlike the Dome, or the palaver over London's mayor, which are taken as further evidence of the Blairite preference for style over content.</p> <p>Tony himself, unsurprisingly, is all things to all women. \"A hypnotising hologram\" (Rowan Pelling, editor of the Erotic Review), \"a leader with a capital L\" (Shirley Conran), \"a cartoon character\" (art dealer Sadie Coles), \"a cool fool in charge of a confederacy of dunces\"(Julie Burchill).</p> <p>Responses on the issue of racism are inevitably dictated by theory and practice. Although the majority of white women share a sense that the situation is improving, as Martha Lane Fox neatly puts it: \"Is it better than it was? Yes, I would think so. But then I'm a white middle-class girl, sitting in my white middle-class world.\" Insitutional racism extends far beyond the Metropolitan Police, argues Shaks Ghosh, chief executive of Crisis. \"A lot of our systems and ways of dealing with people in society are institutionally racist. Those racist tendencies are built into the system.\"</p> <p>Several black women point out a difference in means of expression rather than overall attitude. \"People say it's not as bad as it used to be, but I think it is,\" says DJ Smokin' Jo. \"It's just that it's more undercover. If I go into certain shops, I still get looks or I'm followed around by security.\"</p> <p>For Doreen Lawrence, it is also a question of class. \"Racism exists in all areas of the population but the working-class are more open about it. Among the middle-class, that's where you have the covert racism, in the institutions, universities and schools.\"</p> <p>If there is one voice notably absent it's that of the otherwise ubiquitous Bridget Jones. Nor is the consensus that women are better at being single some desperately upbeat response to meals-for-one hell - just a general, genuine joy at being born dick-less.</p> <p>\"Women are pragmatic - children make us like that,\" says journalist Maggie O'Kane. \"How many women have a midlife crisis? They're too busy.\" MP Claire Ward agrees. \"Women seem to be able to juggle a lot more than men and deal with work and home life better.\"</p> <p>Many younger women refer to the yet-to-be-concluded battle for sexual territory brought on by their increasing independence. \"I see a lot of women who would happily go through life without a partner,\" observes cellist Natalie Clein. \"Women ask much more of a relationship than they did.\"</p> <p>When it comes to the drugs debate, these women avoid the slippery slope hysteria that effortlessly conflates the first spliff with the final hit. \"It's rubbish that there's no distinction made between different drugs,\" says Heather Finlay, managing director of Sainted PR. \"I have friends who use spliff but wouldn't touch anything else. And what about alcohol and tobacco?

This is clear from the BBC/ICM voter poll which accurately predicted the final outcome in London by going back on polling day to voters whom it had previously interviewed during the final week of the campaign.

But this is far from the whole story.</p> <p>In what was a dramatic swing against Labour in the last few days of the London campaign, Labour supporters did not simply stay at home.

The absence of anti-Tory tactical voting is, in fact, but one sign that it may not.</p> <p>In short, there seems little reason why, on the basis of these results, Labour should take success at the next general election for granted. After all, its share of the vote in both these local elections and in last year's European parliament elections are on a par with the calamities suffered by John Major in the last parliament.

The absence of anti-Tory tactical voting is, in fact, but one sign that it may not. In short, there seems little reason why, on the basis of these results, Labour should take success at the next general election for granted. After all, its share of the vote in both these local elections and in last year's European parliament elections are on a par with the calamities suffered by John Major in the last parliament. Then many a commentator refused to believe that they were a portent of the Labour landslide to come. We should avoid making the mistake of ignoring the message from the ballot box now too.

      "bodyText": "A Basque journalist who had been highly critical of the separatist movement ETA was gunned down yesterday, almost certainly by a member of the banned organisation. Jose Luis Lopez de la Calle, 62, was shot four times in the head and chest as he left his house in the Basque town of Andoain to buy Sunday papers. He died immediately. Mr Lopez de la Calle was ETA's third victim since the group renewed its campaign of violence last November after a 14-month ceasefire. In January an army officer was killed in a car bomb in Madrid. A Basque politician was also killed by a car bomb in the run-up to the Spanish general election in March. The separatist rebels, who are fighting for an independent Basque state, have claimed 800 victims since their fight began in 1968. Mr Lopez de la Calle was a columnist for the daily paper El Mundo and sat on the editorial board of its Basque edition. He was also known to be an ETA target. Last February his home was attacked with a molotov cock tail. At the time he declared that, as a Basque, he had never known true freedom. In his youth he fought the totalitarian regime of General Franco, both as a member of the Communist party and as a trade union leader. After Spain became a democracy, extreme nationalists and separatists continued to deny Basques their liberty, he said. Paying tribute to him, the editor of El Mundo, Pedro Ramirez, described him as a relentless campaigner against fascism in all its manifestations. Yesterday's shooting continues a campaign against journalists launched by ETA in March, when the popular presenter of state radio's morning news programme received a bomb disguised as a box of cigars. The weight of the package alerted him and it was defused. Last month a parcel bomb was sent to a journalist on a conservative Madrid newspaper. Media figures have often received threats from ETA but Mr Lopez de la Calle is only the second to have been killed. Another journalist, who was involved in negotiations with the group, was killed in 1978. The Spanish prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, who is in Morocco on the eve of a state visit, cancelled all engagements, and the interior minister and the deputy prime minister travelled to the Basque country. Yesterday's shooting raised the political temperature in north-eastern Spain to boiling point. There were angry calls for the dissolution of the Basque government, led by non-violent nationalists - who have refused to sever their loose links with the separatists' political wing - and for fresh regional elections to be held. Commentators pointed to the contrast with Northern Ireland where the peace process was once more moving ahead. \"The irony is too great,\" said one. \"There they have set a deadline for giving up arms; here we seem to be in a worse position than ever,\" Protests against the latest killing have been called in Madrid, Barcelona and the Basque country. Mr Aznar, whose centre-right government was re-elected on March 12, made his tough stand against ETA one of the focal points of his political platform, ruling out negotiations unless the group unconditionally renounced violence. He also denounced its ceasefire as a \"trick and a sham\". In a speech to parliament as he took office last week he challenged the mainstream Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) to end its frequently ambiguous attitude towards the terrorists. \"What does ETA have to do for the PNV to make a stand?\" he said.",

Public health officials have had to issue a ban on children under two playing in 27 allotments in the constituency of the agriculture secretary, Nick Brown, and have warned people not to eat eggs or poultry from there.

Tricia Cresswell, director of public health at the Newcastle and North Tyneside health authority, has also taken advice from the new food standards agency over the contamination of food grown there. The discovery that the ash was contaminated came six years after it was first spread on public paths, when the Byker residents sent soil samples to Newcastle council's public health department. The results showed very high levels of toxic heavy metals - including mercury at 2,406% above accepted levels, cadmium at 785% above normal levels and lead at 136% above normal. No previous tests appeared to have been made on the ash despite the environment agency having a duty to protect the public. The disclosure led Newcastle council to send 23 samples to Newcastle University for further tests. The samples were then sent to a specialist laboratory in Hamburg. After receiving initial findings the public health authorities immediately issued the health warning. Dr Cresswell said yesterday: \"I decided to take precautionary action after receiving the raw data of the results. The full results will be published and I have commissioned further reports on dioxin in eggs and contamination in the allotment soils.

They commissioned Alan Watson, an environmental consultant, to investigate the health hazards of the new expanded incinerator. His findings - disputed by Newcastle council - say that the expanded incinerator could lead to 800 deaths and 1,600 hospital cases over the next 20 years because of the exposure to chemicals through emissions and dioxins getting into the food chain. The present incinerator is run by Contract Heat and Power in partnership with the council. Between 1993 and last year it turned 50,000 tonnes of municipal waste a year into fuel pellets, which generated large quantities of ash that were then sent, until last year, to municipal sites including allotments and parks. Under the proposed \u00a3100m expansion the incinerator will burn some 80,000 tonnes of muncipal waste and 13,000 tonnes of tyres. Dr Watson said: \"Municipal waste incinerators are a particularly effective way of generating very large quantities of a huge number of compounds and dispersing them into the air and food chain.\" Newcastle council said yesterday that it had decided to commission with the health authority a full-scale environmental and health study into the effect of the new incinerator before taking any decision to proceed with the scheme. Val Barton, the co-ordinator of the campaign, said: \"We are determined that it should not go ahead.\"",
