      "body": "<p>Ronaldo runs the risk of going to prison in Brazil if he does not provide the country's congress with full details of his personal contract with the sportswear manufacturer Nike. </p> <p>The demand was made by Brazilian congressmen yesterday during Ronaldo's appearance at a parliamentary inquiry into the $100m (\u00a367m) contract between Nike and the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF), and the circumstances surrounding the 1998 World Cup final. </p> <p>He has 10 days to produce the document, but he flew out of Brasilia to his home in Rio de Janeiro yesterday leaving his lawyers, Nike's legal team and the congress's lawyers to decide how the contract should be handed over. The Internazionale striker is currently recuperating from a serious knee injury. </p> <p>The day's proceedings brought back uncomfortable memories of Brazil's 3-0 defeat by France in Paris. Ronaldo suffered a fit only hours before the final but was deemed to have recovered sufficiently to be inserted in the teamsheet minutes before kick-off. But he was a shadow of himself in the game. </p> <p>The 10-year Nike-CBF contract, the largest sponsorship deal with a national football side, has been controversial since it was signed in 1996. </p> <p>Politicians have been suspicious that psychological pressure from Nike may have brought about Ronaldo's fit, which in turn affected the team's performance. Others suggest he was forced to play by Nike despite medical advice. But Ronaldo told congressmen he played because he felt healthy enough and medical tests after the fit had showed there was nothing wrong. </p> <p>He refused to reveal details of his personal contract with Nike - believed to be worth $1m a year - when asked by congressmen. But the inquiry's lawyers said he was legally obliged to submit the document. </p> <p>Ronaldo said that if his contract was made public there would be no surprises. \"There is no clause saying what I had to do during the World Cup. My relationship with Nike is very good. They never demanded me to do anything. The only thing they wanted was for me to score some goals wearing their boots.\" </p> <p>More than 30 people have been interviewed over issues stemming from the Nike-CBF contract. Edmundo, who was originally given Ronaldo's place in the final only to be demoted to substitute, the then Brazil coach Mario Zagallo and his team doctors in France 98 have all given evidence about events at the squad's hotel on the day of the final. </p> <p>For virtually every other country second place in a World Cup would be a source of pride but in Brazil the result was seen as an embarrassing failure. Since football success is seen as important to Brazil's national identity, politicians launched a congressional inquiry into the causes of the defeat. A second inquiry is focusing on the organisation and alleged corruption of the domestic game. </p> <p>Politicians are trying to open up the workings of the CBF, which is run by Ricardo Teixeira, the former son-in-law of Joao Havelange, who ran football's world governing body Fifa for 24 years. </p> <p>Suspicion of Nike's influence grew when the contract with the CBF was revealed to include a clause committing Brazil to 50 \"Nike friendlies\" in which at least eight first-team regulars had to play. </p> <p>Ronaldo yesterday came to the multinational company's defence, saying it promoted Brazilian football all over the world and invested heavily in the national team. He said Brazilians were ungrateful. \"If I was Nike I'd not think twice about ripping up the contract and leaving Brazil.\" </p> <p>The questioning yesterday centred on Ronaldo's mysterious fit in Paris. Zagallo said that he was asleep in his room during the afternoon of the final. However, Edmundo and the team doctors said the coach visited Ronaldo in his room. </p> <p>Ronaldo also slept that afternoon and, having woken after his fit, he was not told what had happened until another player, Leonardo, asked him if he was feeling well. Then he was taken to a Paris clinic for tests. These showed him to be healthy and he went straight to the Stade de France to play. </p> <p>Ronaldo authorised the records taken at the clinic to be released to the inquiry. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

He refused to reveal details of his personal contract with Nike - believed to be worth $1m a year - when asked by congressmen. But the inquiry's lawyers said he was legally obliged to submit the document. Ronaldo said that if his contract was made public there would be no surprises. \"There is no clause saying what I had to do during the World Cup. My relationship with Nike is very good. They never demanded me to do anything. The only thing they wanted was for me to score some goals wearing their boots.\" More than 30 people have been interviewed over issues stemming from the Nike-CBF contract. Edmundo, who was originally given Ronaldo's place in the final only to be demoted to substitute, the then Brazil coach Mario Zagallo and his team doctors in France 98 have all given evidence about events at the squad's hotel on the day of the final. For virtually every other country second place in a World Cup would be a source of pride but in Brazil the result was seen as an embarrassing failure. Since football success is seen as important to Brazil's national identity, politicians launched a congressional inquiry into the causes of the defeat. A second inquiry is focusing on the organisation and alleged corruption of the domestic game. Politicians are trying to open up the workings of the CBF, which is run by Ricardo Teixeira, the former son-in-law of Joao Havelange, who ran football's world governing body Fifa for 24 years. Suspicion of Nike's influence grew when the contract with the CBF was revealed to include a clause committing Brazil to 50 \"Nike friendlies\" in which at least eight first-team regulars had to play. Ronaldo yesterday came to the multinational company's defence, saying it promoted Brazilian football all over the world and invested heavily in the national team. He said Brazilians were ungrateful. \"If I was Nike I'd not think twice about ripping up the contract and leaving Brazil.\" The questioning yesterday centred on Ronaldo's mysterious fit in Paris. Zagallo said that he was asleep in his room during the afternoon of the final. However, Edmundo and the team doctors said the coach visited Ronaldo in his room. Ronaldo also slept that afternoon and, having woken after his fit, he was not told what had happened until another player, Leonardo, asked him if he was feeling well. Then he was taken to a Paris clinic for tests. These showed him to be healthy and he went straight to the Stade de France to play. Ronaldo authorised the records taken at the clinic to be released to the inquiry. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Blackburn Rovers scored three times in the opening 18 minutes but, in the end, the final whistle came as a blessed relief. </p> <p>From a seemingly impossible position, Preston very nearly made their hosts pay. Twice they scored in the second half but Blackburn withstood the onslaught and, having climbed from 15th position in mid-October to third, their chances of a return to the Premiership are looking increasingly bright. </p> <p>The proliferation of Lancashire derbies has been a feature of the First Division so far with Bolton and Burnley also harbouring thoughts of representing the north-west in the Premiership next season. </p> <p>Yet, of the contenders clinging on to Fulham's coat-tails, Blackburn look by far the best equipped to file in as runners-up come next May. </p> <p>Under Graeme Souness the club have finally started showing clear signs that they are on the mend following the extravagant and ultimately ill-advised leadership of Brian Kidd and, with Mark Hughes and Matt Jansen leading the attack, goals are always likely. </p> <p>Jansen has been showing the form recently that once saw him coveted by Manchester United and, having coming off second best in a one-on-one with the Preston goalkeeper David Lucas after five minutes, he rapidly atoned with a classy opening goal. </p> <p>As he collected a throw-in and cut into the penalty area, it seemed at first that the striker had run the ball too far. But Jansen managed to ride Michael Appleton's challenge and lashed a venomous drive through Sean Gregan's legs. </p> <p>For Preston, worse was to follow almost immediately. This time Jansen surged down the left before whipping in a precise left-wing cross towards Hughes. From six yards out the rest was a formality. </p> <p>Preston were looking dispirited and by the time Martin Taylor flicked on Craig Hignett's corner for Jansen to head in his second the hosts' fourth successive home win was little more than a formality. </p> <p>Jonathan Macken restored some credibility eight minutes after the interval with a neatly taken goal and as Blackburn lost their impetus the visitors were suddenly playing with renewed urgency. </p> <p>When Henning Berg fouled Mark Rankine on 72 minutes and David Healy converted the penalty, full-blown anxiety was engulfing the home fans. Blackburn held on but only just. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "As a neighbourly dispute, this was more of a one-sided argument until Preston belatedly found their voice. Blackburn Rovers scored three times in the opening 18 minutes but, in the end, the final whistle came as a blessed relief. From a seemingly impossible position, Preston very nearly made their hosts pay. Twice they scored in the second half but Blackburn withstood the onslaught and, having climbed from 15th position in mid-October to third, their chances of a return to the Premiership are looking increasingly bright. The proliferation of Lancashire derbies has been a feature of the First Division so far with Bolton and Burnley also harbouring thoughts of representing the north-west in the Premiership next season. Yet, of the contenders clinging on to Fulham's coat-tails, Blackburn look by far the best equipped to file in as runners-up come next May. Under Graeme Souness the club have finally started showing clear signs that they are on the mend following the extravagant and ultimately ill-advised leadership of Brian Kidd and, with Mark Hughes and Matt Jansen leading the attack, goals are always likely. Jansen has been showing the form recently that once saw him coveted by Manchester United and, having coming off second best in a one-on-one with the Preston goalkeeper David Lucas after five minutes, he rapidly atoned with a classy opening goal. As he collected a throw-in and cut into the penalty area, it seemed at first that the striker had run the ball too far. But Jansen managed to ride Michael Appleton's challenge and lashed a venomous drive through Sean Gregan's legs. For Preston, worse was to follow almost immediately. This time Jansen surged down the left before whipping in a precise left-wing cross towards Hughes. From six yards out the rest was a formality. Preston were looking dispirited and by the time Martin Taylor flicked on Craig Hignett's corner for Jansen to head in his second the hosts' fourth successive home win was little more than a formality. Jonathan Macken restored some credibility eight minutes after the interval with a neatly taken goal and as Blackburn lost their impetus the visitors were suddenly playing with renewed urgency. When Henning Berg fouled Mark Rankine on 72 minutes and David Healy converted the penalty, full-blown anxiety was engulfing the home fans. Blackburn held on but only just. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say. Send your comments, as sharp or as stupid as you like, to editor@footballunlimited.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Devolved Scotland did not choose to be a single-parent family. It was conceived by an odd but stable couple. Donald Dewar and John Smith met at Glasgow University, their passion moulded in the students' union and brought to maturity in the intense struggles of Labour's wilderness years.</p> <p>They rejected displays of nationalist fervour, but shared the certainty that Scotland's particular legal, cultural and educational traditions deserved recognition within the UK state. It was a sophisticated faith, moulded by long years of experience in Scottish and Westminster politics. Each was convinced that a democratic deficit existed in the UK constitution and that measured reform could fill it without posing any threat to the union.</p> <p>Smith's death left Dewar with an awesome responsibility; one he discharged with customary courage and ruthless attention to detail. Scotland got her parliament, and Dewar guided its first faltering steps. But then, three months ago, Dewar died too and Scotland was bereft. His absence hurts not because Dewar was universally loved; he was not. But because his was the mind that squared the circle. From the binary paradigm in which the solution was either independence or the unreformed status quo, Dewar created a synthesis that was, theoretically, greater than the sum of its parts.</p> <p>Now, in his place is Henry McLeish. If he really understands the Dewar legacy, he has not shown it. He appears weak and uncertain; a man whose awkward command of the English language has made his opening weeks as first minister difficult, at times humiliating.</p> <p>He can hardly be looking forward to the new year's introductory session of first minister's questions today, particularly because his cavalier suggestion that his Scottish executive deserves to be renamed a government has earned him a rebuke from Downing Street, and contempt from Scottish Labour MPs at Westminster.</p> <p>Critics have suggested Dewar was unsure about how to use his creation, citing the first year of devolved government, which often looked dithering and incompetent. Dewar must shoulder some blame for that. He had not expended sufficient intellectual energy on how devolution might improve Scotland. That was not his agenda. Dewar was intensely proud of Scotland. For him the constitutional project was about filling a perceived gap in the nature of British government. He rejected the view that his parliament and executive should reform Scottish institutions radically and he was widely criticised for his conservatism.</p> <p>Dewar was partially right. Not about the institutions: Scottish schools are failing and the legal system is institutionally corrupt; Scotland is socially reactionary, still terrified of the moral authority of the Catholic church and cringingly subservient to the power of vested interests in local government and public sector trades unions. But Dewar knew that a programme of radical reform might stir the nationalist sentiments he had opposed for four decades. Just 12 weeks after his death, his fears are already materialising.</p> <p>Devolution has not failed, but it has stalled. A recent publication, The State and the Nations: the first year of devolution in the United Kingdom, makes the case with acute accuracy. Edited by Professor Robert Hazell, director of the constitution unit at University College London, it argues that devolution is \"running on the spot\", that there is frustration in Scotland about the lack of progress, and that the public response has been to demand more powers for the Scottish parliament rather than subject it to a \"lingering death\".</p> <p>Compiled before Dewar died, this assessment would be even more pessimistic if it was commissioned today. Dewar believed he could overcome the instinct that would change devolution into independence. He did not underestimate it, but he understood it. So far the response to nationalism of his successor, McLeish, has been to flirt with it in the most dangerous way.</p> <p>McLeish's early weeks in office have been troubled. He is already known as a man less comfortable in his use of English than John Prescott and George W Bush. His assassination of grammar and syntax has given birth to a new phrase - the McLeich\u00e9.</p> <p>His claim in the Scottish parliament that \"there is only one party in this coalition\" reveals a blinkered tribalism. But McLeish's early sins of inexperience run deeper than clumsiness with words and allies. The leader nobody wanted is betraying Dewar's unionist legacy and some observers fear he cannot avoid what his predecessor would have considered disaster.</p> <p>Certainly, Dewar thought him mediocre and condemned McLeish brutally when he dared to suggest he might make a competent deputy leader of the Scottish Labour party.</p> <p>McLeish deserves little sympathy. He is a cynical machine-politician who compensates for his apparent lack of talent by nurturing ambitions for which he is unsuitable. He knew he would not have won three votes if he had contested the leadership against Dewar. Only when Dewar was dead could he launch his bid for the top. The Scottish Labour party does not deserve to be forgiven for allowing him to get away with it. Neither does the cabinet in London, which chose convenience over principle despite powerful advice not to.</p> <p>And now King Henry (as the newly fawning Daily Record has christened him) is methodically betraying Dewar's legacy. It is not that he is a nationalist. Just that he is ambitious and lacks the cleverness to present devolution as anything other than a half-way house to independence. And he has allowed his ministers to do the same.</p> <p>The Scottish executive is presenting itself as a national government. Jack McConnell, McLeish's defeated opponent in the leadership race, is promising to travel Europe speaking up for Scottish interests - as if devolved Scotland cannot depend on the UK Foreign Office to perform this role (as Dewar intended it should).</p> <p>Ministers in the Scottish executive regard Dublin as a second home and the first minister has also developed a taste for diplomatic travel. He was in Rome last month, performing for all the world like a national leader. His rhetoric is founded on the assumption that devolved government must identify uniquely \"Scottish solutions\" to \"Scottish problems\" - as if poor health, derelict housing, comprehensive education and violent crime are distinctly Scottish problems.</p> <p>McLeish rejects Dewar's confidence that radical reform should be implemented in partnership with London. He wants to go it alone, but appears to lack the ideas or courage to do it well. The SNP and the Scottish Tories are salivating.</p> <p>Dewar knew that too much talk of separate identity was fatal to his project. He perceived devolution as a primarily administrative solution. McLeish appears to want more independence. He has speculated about seeking more powers for the Scottish parliament, but there is insufficient proof that it has learned to use the ones it already has.</p> <p>He has expanded the number of ministers in the Scottish executive to a mind-boggling 22. How can it take so many to perform the roles just four performed pre-devolution? Isn't this a puerile pretence that Scotland's government is equal to the UK one?</p> <p>McLeish shows no indication of understanding the Dewar legacy. Yes, Scottish Labour won the two elections in Glasgow Anniesland occasioned by Dewar's death and just held Falkirk West in the face of a strong nationalist challenge, but it did so on the basis of the lowest turn-out in postwar Scottish history and by a crude refusal to debate with any of its opponents.</p> <p>Dewar was beginning to come to terms with the chasm which had opened up between devolutionary dream and devolutionary reality. His answer was brave, if depressing: to reduce expectation. He rejected the notion that his Scottish executive should win Scottish hearts and minds with a dramatic legislative programme. His programme for the second year of devolution was criticised by colleagues as lacklustre and unimaginitive. It was both.</p> <p>Dewar himself was neither, but he saw the consequences of attempting too much. Every step Scotland took to erect new differences with the rest of Britain risked reinforcing the nationalist case. Dewar would use his influence in London to promote good ideas. He would export thinking from Edinburgh to London. He would not talk up difference in order to bolster his own status. He did not need to.</p> <p>McLeish, meanwhile, is one of a generation of Scottish politicians who see their future in Scotland, not Britain. He did not serve in a British cabinet. McLeish's supporters in London believe he is parochial and bland enough to be compliant. Perhaps.</p> <p>But his first weeks in office and the crude briefing against Dewar by ministers in his new executive (they describe revising Dewar's incrementalism as \"Dumping the crap\") suggest something less pleasant - a man who would never have been appointed to a UK cabinet post who is nevertheless ambitious to create a power base of his own.</p> <p>Unionists who, like Smith and Dewar, supported the reversal of Scotland's democratic deficit hope McLeish will prove us wrong. He still has the time. But he will not do it by speaking the language of nationalism. Much as it may disappoint the flop of mediocrities who have decided to pursue power in Edinburgh, the Scottish executive was not created to be a national government. It was designed to administer a region of the UK and to strengthen the state by doing it well.</p> <p>That was not an impossible ideal but it did require a subtle mind to grasp it. With Dewar and Smith both dead there appear to be few such minds active in Labour politics - north or south of Hadrian's wall. McLeish has started by parading difference as valuable in its own right. Dewar would have called that playing with loaded pistols for no constructive purpose.</p> <p>\u0095 Tim Luckhurst is a former editor of the Scotsman. Between 1985 and 1988 he worked as parliamentary research assistant and press officer to the late Donald Dewar.</p>",

Isn't this a puerile pretence that Scotland's government is equal to the UK one? McLeish shows no indication of understanding the Dewar legacy. Yes, Scottish Labour won the two elections in Glasgow Anniesland occasioned by Dewar's death and just held Falkirk West in the face of a strong nationalist challenge, but it did so on the basis of the lowest turn-out in postwar Scottish history and by a crude refusal to debate with any of its opponents. Dewar was beginning to come to terms with the chasm which had opened up between devolutionary dream and devolutionary reality. His answer was brave, if depressing: to reduce expectation. He rejected the notion that his Scottish executive should win Scottish hearts and minds with a dramatic legislative programme. His programme for the second year of devolution was criticised by colleagues as lacklustre and unimaginitive. It was both. Dewar himself was neither, but he saw the consequences of attempting too much. Every step Scotland took to erect new differences with the rest of Britain risked reinforcing the nationalist case. Dewar would use his influence in London to promote good ideas. He would export thinking from Edinburgh to London. He would not talk up difference in order to bolster his own status. He did not need to. McLeish, meanwhile, is one of a generation of Scottish politicians who see their future in Scotland, not Britain. He did not serve in a British cabinet. McLeish's supporters in London believe he is parochial and bland enough to be compliant. Perhaps. But his first weeks in office and the crude briefing against Dewar by ministers in his new executive (they describe revising Dewar's incrementalism as \"Dumping the crap\") suggest something less pleasant - a man who would never have been appointed to a UK cabinet post who is nevertheless ambitious to create a power base of his own. Unionists who, like Smith and Dewar, supported the reversal of Scotland's democratic deficit hope McLeish will prove us wrong. He still has the time. But he will not do it by speaking the language of nationalism. Much as it may disappoint the flop of mediocrities who have decided to pursue power in Edinburgh, the Scottish executive was not created to be a national government. It was designed to administer a region of the UK and to strengthen the state by doing it well. That was not an impossible ideal but it did require a subtle mind to grasp it. With Dewar and Smith both dead there appear to be few such minds active in Labour politics - north or south of Hadrian's wall. McLeish has started by parading difference as valuable in its own right. Dewar would have called that playing with loaded pistols for no constructive purpose. \u0095 Tim Luckhurst is a former editor of the Scotsman.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair and his people are dismayed that Al Gore won't be president. His failure leaves them with a chasm to cross in Washington. But they were appalled by Gore's campaign. As they open their own four-month election, that is of more searing importance. They think Gore blew it, and are determined not to follow his example. The lesson they learned, however, is not what seems to be generally assumed.</p> <p>Yes, Gore stupidly declined to put the economy at the centre. He was handed a perfect set of cards: high growth, high employment, low inflation, buoyant markets. Vanity restrained him from playing them every day. The economy, he thought, was Clinton's. He wanted to win without Clinton. He thought Clinton stank in many states, which in a religious nation was true. But even where Clinton didn't stink, Gore thought Gore alone must win. If one more middle-sized state had gone his way, we would never have heard of Florida chads. But he didn't take it.</p> <p>Mr Blair and Mr Brown won't make in any way the same mistake. They may nurture rival vanities, but not on this issue. They sink or swim together on the record of economic competence. That's not the critique of Gore that touches them. What they really condemn Gore for is desertion of the cause they shared with Clinton: the social centrism of the third way, balancing liberalism with \"responsibility\" and right with left.</p> <p>Gore became a bit of a lefty. In six months he spoke to more labour union audiences than Blair has in six years. He launched heavy attacks on big business, notably the health insurance industry but also big oil and other heavy-sucking leeches on the US tax base. He cultivated sectional interest groups, especially the blacks and the poor. Within the decorous limits American politics permits, and not forgetting the funds he needed from top people, he fought a class-based campaign.</p> <p>This, New Labour thinks, is how Gore lost - if he did lose, but that's another question. He abandoned the gospel of third wayers, which tells them to avoid the old politics of class. What Clinton and Blair shared, Gore partly ditched, thereby imperilling a constituency that Clinton and his friends at the Democratic Leadership Council had spent a decade building. In a country where the turn-out is low, barely 50%, he reckoned he needed his core constituency more than any other. It did not work out like that.</p> <p>One interpretation of New Labour is that it is now moving the same way. It promises huge boosts in public spending. After the two-year standstill, public services are back in political vogue. Mr Blair appears to be rediscovering his roots, and Mr Brown is feeding them the nutrition he has always believed they need. This, it's said, is Labour's pre-election plan. In addition, they're spending a lot of political capital on sectional voters with the right progressive attitude, whether pro-gay or anti-hunt.</p> <p>But this is far from replicating Gore. Blair, in particular, rejects Goreism. The so-called core vote is not, in Britain, the problem. For a start, who exactly makes up this core? While it is true that some of it will not vote at all, and may therefore create a turnout problem, the people who remain a lot more interesting to Labour than the lifelong Labour vote are those who never voted Labour before 1997 but gave the party its huge majority. Sustaining Labour's credibility as a non-class party, with as much to offer business as working people, is the way it is most determined to do this. It's a judgment from which Blair will never now deviate.</p> <p>Heavy public spending, on the long road to an acceptable standard of public services, is consistent with this. It is as much a demand of new Labour voters as of old. The comprehensive spending review wasn't in any way sectional or distinctively leftwing. It has defined the main battleground of the election. As William Hague made clear yesterday, in the first of the wearisome chain of statistical exchanges that will leave voters entirely baffled between now and May, there is consensus at least about that. The parties are competing about whose public spending will be the more efficient, not about whether it should be spent at all. The Tories have fought shy of making this a contest about ideology. It is entirely about delivery.</p> <p>But Labour, also, avoids its own recognisable ideology. Unlike Al Gore, Tony Blair will not demonise any particle of capitalism. Bits of the core vote might want that, but it won't happen. While he rails against the forces of conservatism, Blair regards capitalism not as an enemy but as his ally in the struggle, an agent of change cutting through barnacles. Since he became leader of his party, he has not, I believe, made a single attack on big business in the vein Gore adopted repeatedly last October. There was a moment when he might have done so, as the oil companies were refusing to run fuel protesters' blockades to keep the country moving. But press conferences at the time found the prime minister not mountainously enraged so much as mute with timorous incomprehension. He could never imagine taking on big business in open conflict.</p> <p>Professor Colin Crouch considers some of the implications of this bondage in a stimulating new pamphlet, Coping with Post-democracy, which makes some links between the decline of the state and the waning of democratic enthusiasm. When so much of the public sector has been handed over to private operators, Crouch argues, what becomes of the image of government as a task that matters? If every public function is tested by its conformity with private-sector management goals, why should anyone get excited about choosing between parties? If government is routinely seen as incompetent, and the company as the only source of expertise, no wonder politics and democracy, in America if not yet here, are at an all-time low.</p> <p>This is a fate that Labour, not so long ago, would have been desperate to avoid. For New Labour the priority is a little different. Crouch suggests that, as the Tories collapse, Labour could even become the business choice. \"In that scenario a movement which had been constructed by the labours of ordinary working people and their sympathisers for over a century would have been hijacked by hostile interests who had themselves trashed their own party.\"</p> <p>At some stage, the Labour party may have to confront the lacuna that has been created on the left. The need for social protection against the vagaries of the market and the anti-communal values of global corporations will demand a political party to turn them into issues of political concern. Gore didn't go that far. But Blairism, at this stage of its evolution, will get nowhere near. The third way is still far more preoccupied with efficiency than with justice and believes that this is, among other things, the way to win. I fear it is right. For the moment.</p> <p>\u0095Colin Crouch, Coping with Post-democracy, Fabian Society \u00a36.95.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair and his people are dismayed that Al Gore won't be president. His failure leaves them with a chasm to cross in Washington. But they were appalled by Gore's campaign. As they open their own four-month election, that is of more searing importance. They think Gore blew it, and are determined not to follow his example. The lesson they learned, however, is not what seems to be generally assumed. Yes, Gore stupidly declined to put the economy at the centre. He was handed a perfect set of cards: high growth, high employment, low inflation, buoyant markets. Vanity restrained him from playing them every day. The economy, he thought, was Clinton's. He wanted to win without Clinton. He thought Clinton stank in many states, which in a religious nation was true. But even where Clinton didn't stink, Gore thought Gore alone must win. If one more middle-sized state had gone his way, we would never have heard of Florida chads. But he didn't take it. Mr Blair and Mr Brown won't make in any way the same mistake. They may nurture rival vanities, but not on this issue. They sink or swim together on the record of economic competence. That's not the critique of Gore that touches them. What they really condemn Gore for is desertion of the cause they shared with Clinton: the social centrism of the third way, balancing liberalism with \"responsibility\" and right with left. Gore became a bit of a lefty. In six months he spoke to more labour union audiences than Blair has in six years. He launched heavy attacks on big business, notably the health insurance industry but also big oil and other heavy-sucking leeches on the US tax base. He cultivated sectional interest groups, especially the blacks and the poor. Within the decorous limits American politics permits, and not forgetting the funds he needed from top people, he fought a class-based campaign. This, New Labour thinks, is how Gore lost - if he did lose, but that's another question. He abandoned the gospel of third wayers, which tells them to avoid the old politics of class. What Clinton and Blair shared, Gore partly ditched, thereby imperilling a constituency that Clinton and his friends at the Democratic Leadership Council had spent a decade building. In a country where the turn-out is low, barely 50%, he reckoned he needed his core constituency more than any other. It did not work out like that. One interpretation of New Labour is that it is now moving the same way. It promises huge boosts in public spending. After the two-year standstill, public services are back in political vogue. Mr Blair appears to be rediscovering his roots, and Mr Brown is feeding them the nutrition he has always believed they need. This, it's said, is Labour's pre-election plan. In addition, they're spending a lot of political capital on sectional voters with the right progressive attitude, whether pro-gay or anti-hunt. But this is far from replicating Gore. Blair, in particular, rejects Goreism. The so-called core vote is not, in Britain, the problem. For a start, who exactly makes up this core? While it is true that some of it will not vote at all, and may therefore create a turnout problem, the people who remain a lot more interesting to Labour than the lifelong Labour vote are those who never voted Labour before 1997 but gave the party its huge majority. Sustaining Labour's credibility as a non-class party, with as much to offer business as working people, is the way it is most determined to do this. It's a judgment from which Blair will never now deviate. Heavy public spending, on the long road to an acceptable standard of public services, is consistent with this. It is as much a demand of new Labour voters as of old. The comprehensive spending review wasn't in any way sectional or distinctively leftwing. It has defined the main battleground of the election. As William Hague made clear yesterday, in the first of the wearisome chain of statistical exchanges that will leave voters entirely baffled between now and May, there is consensus at least about that. The parties are competing about whose public spending will be the more efficient, not about whether it should be spent at all. The Tories have fought shy of making this a contest about ideology. It is entirely about delivery. But Labour, also, avoids its own recognisable ideology. Unlike Al Gore, Tony Blair will not demonise any particle of capitalism. Bits of the core vote might want that, but it won't happen. While he rails against the forces of conservatism, Blair regards capitalism not as an enemy but as his ally in the struggle, an agent of change cutting through barnacles. Since he became leader of his party, he has not, I believe, made a single attack on big business in the vein Gore adopted repeatedly last October. There was a moment when he might have done so, as the oil companies were refusing to run fuel protesters' blockades to keep the country moving. But press conferences at the time found the prime minister not mountainously enraged so much as mute with timorous incomprehension. He could never imagine taking on big business in open conflict. Professor Colin Crouch considers some of the implications of this bondage in a stimulating new pamphlet, Coping with Post-democracy, which makes some links between the decline of the state and the waning of democratic enthusiasm. When so much of the public sector has been handed over to private operators, Crouch argues, what becomes of the image of government as a task that matters? If every public function is tested by its conformity with private-sector management goals, why should anyone get excited about choosing between parties? If government is routinely seen as incompetent, and the company as the only source of expertise, no wonder politics and democracy, in America if not yet here, are at an all-time low. This is a fate that Labour, not so long ago, would have been desperate to avoid. For New Labour the priority is a little different. Crouch suggests that, as the Tories collapse, Labour could even become the business choice. \"In that scenario a movement which had been constructed by the labours of ordinary working people and their sympathisers for over a century would have been hijacked by hostile interests who had themselves trashed their own party.\" At some stage, the Labour party may have to confront the lacuna that has been created on the left. The need for social protection against the vagaries of the market and the anti-communal values of global corporations will demand a political party to turn them into issues of political concern. Gore didn't go that far. But Blairism, at this stage of its evolution, will get nowhere near. The third way is still far more preoccupied with efficiency than with justice and believes that this is, among other things, the way to win. I fear it is right. For the moment. \u0095Colin Crouch, Coping with Post-democracy, Fabian Society \u00a36.95. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

      "bodyText": "Labour is to repeat its controversial pledge card at the coming election, even though two of its five 1997 pledges will not have been met if Tony Blair goes ahead with his plan to stage poll day on May 3. As the prime minister and William Hague tested their economic strategies for the campaign in the Commons, Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's spokesman, praised the pledges as \"a very effective method of communicating between a political party and the electorate ... there will certainly be something like that again,\" he said. Though ministers are not confirming May 3 as polling day yesterday's heated exchanges in the first prime minister's question time of the new year did little to dampen speculation. Reinforcing that impression Mr Blair in the Commons mockingly deployed the gloomy predictions from the previously little known website of Nigel Hastilow, Conservative candidate for the Labour-held marginal of Edgbaston, Birmingham. \"For many voters and most of the media the Conservative party is a lost cause,\" Mr Hastilow had admitted on his site. Mr Hague's onslaught on Labour as a high-tax party which wasted the money it raised from voters was also blunted by Mr Blair's contention that the Tory poster campaign - \"You paid the tax, so where's the money gone?\" - was a \"huge strategic blunder\" because it highlighted the Conservatives' weak commitment to public services. The prime minister contrasted Labour's commitment to increased spending on health, education and law and order - 3.3% in each of the next three years - with the Conservative emphasis on cutting spending back to within \"affordable\" limits. \"We are in favour of making that investment in public services. Will you say whether you are committed to those sums or not?\" he asked the Tory leader who had been harrying him over tax rates and staffing levels, notably among the police. Later Mr Campbell told reporters the party was on course to meet its two unfulfilled pledges in \"the not too distant future\".

Labour has fullfilled three of its five pledges: to cut youth unemployment by 250,000; to cut hospital waiting lists by 100,000; and not to raise income tax rates. But it admits it will not have cut class sizes to less than 30 for all four. five and six-year olds by May, and failed to halve the time from arrest to sentencing for young offenders. Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, said: \"It is by sticking to Tory spending plans that this government left itself no room for manoeuvre and will fail to keep its pledge to the electorate\". Michael Ancram, the Conservative chairman said: \"The cheque is always in the post with this government.

      "bodyText": "The decision on whether local authorities should provide an extra \u00a310.8m to pay for flood damage in one of the worst-hit areas of Britain was today deferred in a bid to secure extra funding from the government. A meeting of the Yorkshire Flood Defence Committee in York voted unanimously to postpone a decision on whether to give the Environment Agency a 63% increase in its levy to pay for essential work for flood defences caused by November's devastating flooding. More than 2,500 homes were flooded in the region and more than a third of the total emergency response and repair costs for the whole of the country were incurred in the county. If the flood defence committee agrees to the levy increase it could mean a hike in council tax bills in the region of \u00a36 to \u00a310 per household per year. The Environment Agency told today's meeting it had submitted a bid for some of the \u00a351m funding promised by deputy prime minister John Prescott during the crisis. But committee chairman Roy Ward, who told the meeting the floods in Yorkshire were the worst for 400 years, said there had been no response from the government. Councillor Peter Sowray, representing North Yorkshire county council and the City of York council, told the committee: \"John Prescott came to Yorkshire and stood up to his waist in water and said 'Don't worry, we'll help'. \"We've got to keep him to his promises - he's not to be allowed to escape on that one.\" The Environment Agency says the increase, an extra \u00a310.8m on top of last year's levy of \u00a317.2m, was needed to avert another disaster. Emergency repairs to existing defences will cost \u00a32.8m, while \u00a37.8m has been added to the agency's existing \u00a315.1m capital programme for flood alleviation schemes. Recommending deferment of the decision, Jack Goodhand, a councillor representing Barnsley, Rotherham and Doncaster borough councils and Derbyshire county council, said: \"Local authorities are not inhuman bodies - we are concerned about what happened but we also have a responsibility to ensure that we look after all areas of the community.\" Environment Agency appointee Ian Bonas pointed out that any money the local authorities agree to provide will be reimbursed in their government funding next year.

Teams of four will compete for the prize, which takes the form of a year's stay in a luxury apartment, which is expected to be made later this year. Last year the BBC was accused of bending the rules after it doubled the top prize on The Weakest Link to \u00a320,000, setting a new high for payouts. While there is no limit on what prizes television shows can offer, the BBC guidelines for programme makers say that \"cash prizes should be avoided.

Mr Sullivan said his rival's pornography magazines, which include x-rated publications such as Asian Babes and Forum, \"are not worth tuppence\". \"The whole adult magazine market is saturated and under pressure from TV and the internet,\" he said. \"The talk of getting \u00a310m-\u00a320m for them is absolute nonsense. I cannot conceive of anyone who would want to buy them.\" Mr Sullivan added that the titles had too small a circulation and were of \"minimum value\". \"They were launched with little advertising or promotion and I will bet they are not doing well,\" he said. Mr Desmond owns the Northern &amp; Shell publishing group but keeps the porn titles at arm's length, producing them through his Portland Investments firm. Portland turned over \u00a321m in 1999, according to the latest published accounts, leaving a profit of just \u00a31.7m. But the accounts also show that the publishing arm of Portland made a loss of \u00a3860,000. The television side of the company, however, does make money and registered a profit of \u00a32.5m in 1999. A successful sale of the titles, which would include various websites, would remove any chance of trade secretary Stephen Byers blocking last year's acquisition of the Express group on public interest grounds. Mr Sullivan set an alarming precedent for Mr Desmond 10 years ago, when he was barred from buying the Bristol Evening Post group by the Monopolies &amp; Mergers Commission. The commission ruled that his ownership \"could harm the standing of the papers in their community\". Mr Desmond needs cash to invest in the ailing Express titles, and he has already embarked on a cost-cutting spree at Ludgate House. The Express takeover was funded by a \u00a397m loan from Commerzbank, and industry experts say it will take a minimum of \u00a3100m over the next three years to turn around the fortunes of the Daily and Sunday Express and the Daily Star.",

So why should South Africa defend and implement its multilingual language policy, and not give way to an English-only or English-mainly policy? </p> <p>English is currently the dominant language of teaching in South Africa. Indeed for most children from an African-language background almost all education after the first three years of schooling is in English. </p> <p>Equally important is the fact that most schools are staffed by second- or third-language speakers of English, many of whom are not proficient enough in English to serve as good models for their students. There is little doubt that the language issue is one of the main factors explaining the disastrous drop-out and failure rates, which affect mainly black students. </p> <p>The 1997 policy was intended to sustain the home language throughout the educational career of the learner, preferably as a medium, but in any case as a subject. In practice, however, it is not possible for children from an African-language background to receive instruction through the medium of their home language beyond Grade 3 or 4. </p> <p>In fact one of the ineffable ironies of the new South Africa is that the only children who have mother-tongue education (L1-medium) are precisely those who have been advantaged in most other respects in the course of South Africa's history: English- and most Afrikaans-speaking children. </p> <p>Before the first non-racial elections in April 1994 most people assumed that English would become the only, or at least the main language of teaching in educational institutions. This was, after all, what had happened in virtually all ex-colonial African countries in the English sphere of interest. Namibia is the latest example. </p> <p>The dialectic of South African history, however, ordained otherwise. Because of the passionate commitment of white Afrikaans-speaking South Africans to their language, their political representatives during the negotiation process in the early 90s insisted on the continued equality of Afrikaans with English as a condition for ceding office to the representatives of the liberation movement. These, in turn, for obvious political reasons could not concede to Afrikaans what they did not also give to the indigenous languages. Hence, the 11 official languages of the new South Africa. </p> <p>It should come as no surprise that all South Africans agree about the need for English as the second language, mainly because it is so obviously the key to economic empowerment. Yet for as long as the vast majority of people are not proficient in English, and without the promotion of multilingualism and the equitable treatment of all languages, democracy will remain a sham. This is so because most people would have to conduct all their important affairs, as they do at present, in a language they barely understand. </p> <p>An English-only, or even an English-mainly, policy necessarily condemns most people, and thus the country as a whole, to a permanent state of mediocrity, since people are unable to be spontaneous, creative and self-confident if they cannot use their first language. </p> <p>Even more important, however, is the fact that economic development, which in the modern world is dependent on high levels of scientific and technological know-how, will continue to be stymied because the English-knowing layer from which the expertise can be recruited will continue to be very thin. </p> <p>To argue that a policy of multilingualism is too 'costly' to implement is disingenuous at worst and ill-informed and unexplored at best. On principle any polity has to be prepared to invest in the necessary infrastructure in those economic and social domains where it may have a comparative disadvantage. If it is a country where water resources are scarce, then boreholes, desalination plants and other equipment have to be invested in. If there are many languages, then investment has to be made in the different ways and means available for the facilitation of communication among the people of the country. </p> <p>In our case such investment can either be directed towards the goal of making English the lingua franca of the entire population in the short term (despite the negative experience in this regard in most of the rest of Africa) or towards multilingual proficiency, or towards both. The official language policy in education promotes this third option. </p> <p>It follows, then, that a system of bilingual education is an essential transitional strategy towards the normalisation of education, until the situation is reached where English is learned by most children as a subject at school rather than as an ineffectual medium of learning in general. But elitist policy orientations, the lack of political will and bureaucratic inertia have tended to promote the first option in practice. </p> <p>These, then, are the factors that have to be resolved in the equation of language medium policy in South African education. In most schools there is no doubt that the basic principle of additive bilingualism - sustaining the home language (L1) as a medium, and, if this is impossible, as a subject - is the best way forward. Besides the findings of international research about the desirability and effectiveness of L1-medium education, the most recent authoritative language survey (commissioned by the Pan South African Language Board) tilts the balance in favour of the advocates of bilingual and \u00dcmother-tongue\" education, even if on the surface this would appear to buck the global trend. </p> <p>Those of us who advocate bilingual education as an inescapable transitional strategy - which may, however, become the global norm because of the imperatives of globalisation - and of mother-tongue education as the most effective approach to education in most situations have the South African constitution as well as the official language policy in education on our side.

As one of the most successful internet companies trading on Nasdaq, any slippage from the $14bn Yahoo! can be expected further to shake investor confidence in the technology sector as a whole. Tim Koogle, chairman and chief executive officer of Yahoo!, defended his company's performance. \"By almost any measure Yahoo! continued to outperform the industry, and took market share despite a challenging environment,\" he said. He blamed the lowered earnings projections on a weak economy. The news of Yahoo!'s difficulties coincide with that of another popular US internet portal, AltaVista, which today pulled its intended flotation and refused to set a new date. AltaVista had previously cancelled plans to float on the stock market in December 1999.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>SMALL CLUB, BIG NOISE</strong></p> <p>It's got all the ingredients: a chairman who likes to wear sunglasses in TV studios; a litigious ex-manager; the nation's foremost moralising PR exec; the threat of enforced relegation; and Peter Taylor in a bath. Yes, it's Gillingham FC, the club that puts the \"odd\" into modest First Division outfit.</p> <p>This morning, the Daily Express reported that an unnamed private investigator has prepared a \"secret dossier\" containing allegations of Swindon-style financial irregularities at the Kent club during last season's successful promotion campaign (we checked the article for hilarious hidden messages, by the way, but couldn't find any). The report claimed the dossier had been prepared on behalf of ex-boss Tony Pulis, who is currently suing the Gills for unfair dismissal. And to ensure that justice was done, the investigator took the dossier straight to... Max Clifford.</p> <p>Clifford was calm today despite holding a potential time-bomb etc. that, if proven correct, could see the Gills consigned to the Second Division. \"[The investigator] told me: 'You have exposed Jeffrey Archer, Jonathan Aitken and people like that - what about corruption in football?'\" said the man who represented Mandy Allwood. \"I said if there is corruption in football, I'm more than happy to show it up.\" With this paragon of justice on board, all criminals better look out.</p> <p>Fortunately for Gillingham chairman Paul Scally, he's no criminal. (Although his wife, who was sent to jail for breaching bail conditions on a cocaine possession charge is. Scally said at the time: \"Prison is probably the best place for her now. It's the only place she's safe from drug dealers.\" Right.) Possibly wearing shades, Scally today strongly refuted the allegations and insisted he \"will defend any allegations against the football club in the High Court in the appropriate manner and at the relevant time\". Only the High Court, mind. The Fiver suspects there might be more in this story yet.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>CLICK YOURSELF UP</strong></p> <p>Things are already looking rosy for top internet startup www.let'ssellhim.com, a division of Bradford City new-media holdings. OK, so they may not yet have pushed through the deal with Udinese for Benito Carbone, and the only person to visit the Stanley Collymore page works for Stafford Rangers, but you can't faff around on a ridiculous child's metal scooter before you can walk. And in any case, it looks as though Bradford have found an \u00a3800,000 buyer for Dan Petrescu in the super-surfin' shape of Glenn Hoddle.</p> <p>\"Petrescu is talking to Southampton at the moment so we will wait and see what develops,\" announced no-nonsense Bradford visionary Jim Jefferies, looking tougher than a line of hard code. \"It is a situation which suits both clubs. He's got three-and-a-half years left on his contract so we're making a saving on that side and obviously that will help the club. But it's not about Dan going for financial reasons. He is a good player.\"</p> <p>That being the case, you may wonder why Bradford are prepared to sell the 32-year-old Romanian. But like any new-media guru, Jefferies can make a supremely idiotic idea which is certain to go disastrously wrong sound great in the short term. \"We are bottom of the league after 21 games and [Petrescu, Carbone and Collymore] have been playing regularly, but that has not worked. I feel we've a better chance of beating relegation without them and that's no disrespect to them or their talent.\" Uh-huh.</p> <p>+++ STOP CONTENT-MANAGEMENT SYSTEM+++ Bantams crowd favourite Dean Windass is \"confused\" and \"disappointed\" after reports that he's on his way to Middlesbrough or Leicester. Take our word for it, you want to get in on the ground floor with this Bradford thing before it all goes stellar!</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>APOLOGY (AGAIN)</strong></p> <p>We pressed the wrong button again yesterday. And while it was undoubtedly Jon \"Fowl-Up\" Fowler's fault, he wasn't actually in the office at the time, and isn't here today either. So we will have to say sorry on his behalf for bombarding some of you with a message from New Zealand-based Formway Furniture about how one of their staff wanted off the Fiver mailing list.</p> <p>We apologise for any inconvenience caused. But then again, if you live in Auckland, you now know where to get a nice new chest of drawers - swings and roundabouts, innit?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Though he wants to play attacking, attractive football, his priority will be to get the defence right. He wants them to concentrate on defending like the Italians do. He wants them to be more pragmatic, pay closer attention to detail and, above all, to take care\" - Does that mean no more of the Neville brothers? Roberto Mancini makes a few predictions for Svennis's England.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>FAMILY AFFAIRS</strong></p> <p>When East End Arry is on the rampage, no-one is safe. Not even his second-favourite son Paolo Di Canio, who after missing the New Year's Day mauling against Manchester United with the flu, has faced insinuations that he'd prefer the Uncle Bert (shirt) of Lazio to the claret and blue of West Ham. And Arry's even stuck it up his captain, Steve Lomas, who a day after claiming he was \"settled here and have never asked for a transfer\", was stunned to find they were trying to 'appeny dip (ship) him up North just to make a few bob (bob).</p> <p>But say what you like about Harry's style - it gets results. Because today, as one of Arry's henchmen hovered menacingly in the background, Di Canio and Lomas both pledged their loyalty to the club. A sweating Di Canio was first, telling West Ham's official website: \"I have no intention of leaving West Ham and I want the supporters to know that. I have two-and-a-half years remaining on my contract and I intend to stay here ... I love this club.\" Of course he does, and he loves Arry too, we wager.</p> <p>Steve Lomas quickly followed suit. \"I must admit it has been unsettling but the club made the decision to accept the fee and things do go through your mind,\" he stuttered.

      "bodyText": "SMALL CLUB, BIG NOISE It's got all the ingredients: a chairman who likes to wear sunglasses in TV studios; a litigious ex-manager; the nation's foremost moralising PR exec; the threat of enforced relegation; and Peter Taylor in a bath. Yes, it's Gillingham FC, the club that puts the \"odd\" into modest First Division outfit. This morning, the Daily Express reported that an unnamed private investigator has prepared a \"secret dossier\" containing allegations of Swindon-style financial irregularities at the Kent club during last season's successful promotion campaign (we checked the article for hilarious hidden messages, by the way, but couldn't find any). The report claimed the dossier had been prepared on behalf of ex-boss Tony Pulis, who is currently suing the Gills for unfair dismissal. And to ensure that justice was done, the investigator took the dossier straight to... Max Clifford. Clifford was calm today despite holding a potential time-bomb etc. that, if proven correct, could see the Gills consigned to the Second Division. \"[The investigator] told me: 'You have exposed Jeffrey Archer, Jonathan Aitken and people like that - what about corruption in football?'\" said the man who represented Mandy Allwood. \"I said if there is corruption in football, I'm more than happy to show it up.\" With this paragon of justice on board, all criminals better look out. Fortunately for Gillingham chairman Paul Scally, he's no criminal. (Although his wife, who was sent to jail for breaching bail conditions on a cocaine possession charge is. Scally said at the time: \"Prison is probably the best place for her now. It's the only place she's safe from drug dealers.\" Right.) Possibly wearing shades, Scally today strongly refuted the allegations and insisted he \"will defend any allegations against the football club in the High Court in the appropriate manner and at the relevant time\". Only the High Court, mind. The Fiver suspects there might be more in this story yet. * * * * * * * * * * * * * CLICK YOURSELF UP Things are already looking rosy for top internet startup www.let'ssellhim.com, a division of Bradford City new-media holdings. OK, so they may not yet have pushed through the deal with Udinese for Benito Carbone, and the only person to visit the Stanley Collymore page works for Stafford Rangers, but you can't faff around on a ridiculous child's metal scooter before you can walk. And in any case, it looks as though Bradford have found an \u00a3800,000 buyer for Dan Petrescu in the super-surfin' shape of Glenn Hoddle. \"Petrescu is talking to Southampton at the moment so we will wait and see what develops,\" announced no-nonsense Bradford visionary Jim Jefferies, looking tougher than a line of hard code. \"It is a situation which suits both clubs. He's got three-and-a-half years left on his contract so we're making a saving on that side and obviously that will help the club. But it's not about Dan going for financial reasons. He is a good player.\" That being the case, you may wonder why Bradford are prepared to sell the 32-year-old Romanian. But like any new-media guru, Jefferies can make a supremely idiotic idea which is certain to go disastrously wrong sound great in the short term. \"We are bottom of the league after 21 games and [Petrescu, Carbone and Collymore] have been playing regularly, but that has not worked. I feel we've a better chance of beating relegation without them and that's no disrespect to them or their talent.\" Uh-huh. +++ STOP CONTENT-MANAGEMENT SYSTEM+++ Bantams crowd favourite Dean Windass is \"confused\" and \"disappointed\" after reports that he's on his way to Middlesbrough or Leicester. Take our word for it, you want to get in on the ground floor with this Bradford thing before it all goes stellar! * * * * * * * * * * * * * APOLOGY (AGAIN) We pressed the wrong button again yesterday. And while it was undoubtedly Jon \"Fowl-Up\" Fowler's fault, he wasn't actually in the office at the time, and isn't here today either. So we will have to say sorry on his behalf for bombarding some of you with a message from New Zealand-based Formway Furniture about how one of their staff wanted off the Fiver mailing list. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. But then again, if you live in Auckland, you now know where to get a nice new chest of drawers - swings and roundabouts, innit? * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Though he wants to play attacking, attractive football, his priority will be to get the defence right. He wants them to concentrate on defending like the Italians do. He wants them to be more pragmatic, pay closer attention to detail and, above all, to take care\" - Does that mean no more of the Neville brothers? Roberto Mancini makes a few predictions for Svennis's England. * * * * * * * * * * * * * FAMILY AFFAIRS When East End Arry is on the rampage, no-one is safe. Not even his second-favourite son Paolo Di Canio, who after missing the New Year's Day mauling against Manchester United with the flu, has faced insinuations that he'd prefer the Uncle Bert (shirt) of Lazio to the claret and blue of West Ham. And Arry's even stuck it up his captain, Steve Lomas, who a day after claiming he was \"settled here and have never asked for a transfer\", was stunned to find they were trying to 'appeny dip (ship) him up North just to make a few bob (bob). But say what you like about Harry's style - it gets results. Because today, as one of Arry's henchmen hovered menacingly in the background, Di Canio and Lomas both pledged their loyalty to the club. A sweating Di Canio was first, telling West Ham's official website: \"I have no intention of leaving West Ham and I want the supporters to know that. I have two-and-a-half years remaining on my contract and I intend to stay here ... I love this club.\" Of course he does, and he loves Arry too, we wager. Steve Lomas quickly followed suit. \"I must admit it has been unsettling but the club made the decision to accept the fee and things do go through your mind,\" he stuttered. But a hard prod of something metallic in the back from one of Arry's men soon got him singing the right tune: \"I want to forget all about this now and get on with the job of helping West Ham into Europe.\" And so the good ship West Ham sails on, and East End Arry's on the prowl. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Norway midfielder John Arne Riise is wanted by four English clubs, according to his agent Einar Baardsen. \"We are talking to Leeds, but there are now three more clubs very interested in Riise,\" Baardsen said. \"We cannot say who the teams are as they have told us to keep very quiet, but because of their interest we will be talking to Monaco next week.\" Monaco will turn to Aston Villa defender Gareth Southgate if their \u00a33m bid for Chelsea's Frank LeBoeuf is turned down, according to reports. Lazio are interested in Rangers defender Lorenzo Amoruso. \"Lazio want him and the departure of Sven-Goran Eriksson has changed nothing,\" said West Ham manager Harry Redknapp. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Carlisle chairman Michael Knighton has claimed that a local man is interested in buying his remaining stake in the club: . The news comes a day after Scottish \"businessman\" Stephen Brown - who drives a battered old Vauxhall, lives in sheltered housing and used to work as a barman in a curry house - failed to stump up the \u00a3250,000 needed to buy Knighton's shares in the club's parent company CUFC Holdings Ltd. Nottingham Forest have agreed a fee of around \u00a33m for Ipswich striker David Johnson. Forest manager David Platt will meet the player tonight and hopes that 24-year-old Johnson will agree personal terms and pass a medical within the next 24 hours. Tayside Police have confirmed that Motherwell midfielder Steven Hammell has been charged with a breach of the peace over an alleged incident at St Johnstone. Hammell was involved in a skirmish with Saints wing-back Momo Sylla during the Fir Park's side 3-2 win in Perth two days before Christmas. Everton striker Duncan Ferguson could miss Saturday's Premiership match with Tottenham after breaking a bone in his hand during the break-in at his home last weekend. Manchester City's Tony Grant is talking over a \u00a3400,000 move to Barnsley, while team-mate Ian Bishop is set to join Sheffield Wednesday on a free transfer. Huddersfield are hoping to agree a deal with Birmingham City for striker Peter Ndlovu, who recently scored four goals in seven games while on loan at the McAlpine Stadium. Spanish referees will be the first in Europe to wear advertising on their shirts, the Spanish Football Federation have announced. Referees in the First and Second Divisions will carry the name of broadcasting platform Quiero on the front of their shirts during league and cup matches. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Channel 4: Football Italia (3.10am) \"I used to work for a mail-order wine company,\" writes Alastair O'Neill.

      "bodyText": "The Metropolitan Police is preparing to settle a \u00a31m damages claim brought by a black activist whose allegations of \"systematic harassment\" have been supported by a secret report compiled by London's top Asian officer, the Guardian can reveal. Ten senior officers, including the Met's deputy commissioner Ian Blair, have concluded that the dossier, seen by the Guardian, leaves the force \"incredibly vulnerable\" to litigation because it highlights \"negative stereotyping\" of Delroy Lindo and his wife Sonia by officers in Hornsey, north London. A lack of professionalism also threatened to undermine the confidence of the ethnic minority community, the report warned. Mr Lindo said last night: \"I am pleased it seems to have vindicated what we have been saying about police harassment. My family has suffered horrendously. Me, my wife and my children. It has ruined our lives.\" The findings, though, have provoked a poisonous internal battle at Scotland Yard. Some high-ranking officers - and the Met's solicitor David Hamilton - are \"incensed\" with the report. They believe its author, the Met's deputy assistant commissioner Tarique Ghaffur, was \"naive\" and, in parts, ill-informed. Their main concern is that Mr Ghaffur did not interview any of the 47 officers who came into contact with Mr Lindo to test his allegations against their own. The report's conclusions, they believe, were drawn without proper analysis, leaving the Met with what one source called \"a very large poisoned chalice\". \"Perhaps he did not fully realise the legal implications or the political fallout,\" the source said. Mr Ghaffur is standing foursquare behind his report and its conclusions. He was instructed to conduct an inquiry in July last year following numerous complaints by the Lindos about the way they were being treated. Mr Lindo, 41, has been stopped 37 times since 1992. He has been charged 17 times and cleared 17 times of offences including assaults on police officers. He has described being arrested for sucking his teeth in the presence of a police officer, driving with a dirty number plate and carrying a copy of the Observer newspaper. Mr Lindo has launched five civil suits against the Met, which are all outstanding. With a team of 16 officers, Mr Ghaffur was asked to investigate the claims and whether Mr Lindo's support for Winston Silcott, who was wrongly convicted of murdering PC Keith Blakelock during the Broadwater Farm riots, was a significant factor. In the summary of the 50-page report, Mr Ghaffur said there was \"no evidence of an organised conspiracy\" to harass Mr Lindo, and ruled out racial discrimination as an issue. But it added: \"There was evidence that harassment has taken place because of negative stereotyping of the Lindo family. This has been caused by police officers in Hornsey focusing on the fact that Mr Lindo has spent convictions.\" The report goes on to describe a \"collective organisational failure of policing of incidents\" and warns that \"the failures have put the MPS [Metropolitan Police Service] in serious risk of undermining the confidence of the ethnic minority community\". Mr Ghaffur is also critical of the Lindos. The report said they were \"partly instrumental in creating a spiral of deteriorating relationships. \"At times [they] exhibited extremes of behaviour that led to over-reaction of the police and punitive use of the criminal justice system.\" One Scotland Yard source said: \"There's fault on both sides of this. We are paid to be professional. They [officers] have got to learn to act professionally. \"Delroy Lindo got in their face a bit.

      "bodyText": "Researchers at America's Oregon Health Sciences University have created the world's first genetically modified primate. The male baby rhesus monkey, whose name ANDi stands for 'inserted DNA' spelled backward, was born in October last year. ANDi carries a tiny extra bit of DNA in a gene introduced as a marker that can be seen under a microscope because it actually glows green. ANDi's creation is described in the current issue of the journal Science. Researchers hope they now can introduce other genes in rhesus monkeys that could trigger a host of human diseases such as Alzheimer's, diabetes, breast cancer or HIV in order to find a way to block them at the genetic level. The technique for inserting the gene has been used for more than a quarter century in mice, but comparing a mouse to a human being has limits, said Dr Gerald Schatten. He is leading the research at the university's Oregon Regional Primate Center. Because monkeys are close cousins to humans in terms of DNA, they may give scientists a better picture of how human disease develops. \"We're at an extraordinary moment in the history of humans,\" Dr Schatten said. A year ago, Dr Schatten reported the first monkey successfully cloned by embryo splitting. That monkey is named Tetra. ANDi and his surrogate mother, as well as Tetra, remain healthy, according to Dr Schatten. ANDi received an extra gene while he was still an unfertilized egg. Dr Schatten, lead author Anthony W.S. Chan and other researchers modified and then fertilized more than 200 rhesus monkey eggs. Forty embryos were produced, and resulted in five pregnancies and three live births. Of the three baby monkeys, only ANDi proved to have the modified genes.",

But the leafy cul-de-sac is the site of a pilot scheme that, if successful, could alter the landscape of every street in the country. </p> <p>About a month ago, a number of smart aluminium boxes, roughly the size of picnic hampers, began to appear on the doorsteps of the road's 1950s townhouses. The boxes belong to Homeport, an internet start-up that thinks it has found the answer to the biggest problem in home shopping: how to deliver goods to our homes when we are out at work. </p> <p>According to the Post Office, home shopping on the internet is about to explode. A recent internal survey predicted that more than six million of us would have shopped online by the new year. In the run up to Christmas, the Post Office allowed 1,000 of its high-street counters to be used as pick-up points for goods ordered over the net. And if the postie can't help you, no worries: companies as diverse as Express Dairies and Pizza Hut are vying for a slice of the home-delivery pie. </p> <p>Still, the main thing restraining internet shopping is that most people want their goods at the same time - between seven and eight in the evening. But, for a part-time antiques dealer and full-time mother like Melissa Foks, being in at a set time is not always an option. So, although she had never shopped online before, she volunteered to be one of the first to try out the Homeport system. </p> <p>Homeport sells a small metal panel (measuring 12cm by 15cm) that is bolted to the side of your house. This houses three \"ports\" to which the cables that secure Homeport's delivery boxes can be attached. </p> <p>My Homeport was delivered last week. Four deep holes had to be drilled into the side of my flat, but the installation took only five minutes. I ordered aproximately \u00a360 worth of shopping via the internet, and when I came home from work the following lunchtime, an aluminium box was waiting for me. </p> <p>After about five minutes of fiddling with the controls, I managed to unhook the cable and carry my bounty upstairs. The company knew that I was a journalist writing about the Homeport, but the customers I have spoken to had few complaints. Like most of the best ideas, it's dead simple. </p> <p>Foks says she is quite proud of the Homeport that is bolted to the side of her house in Burntwood Grange Road. She uses a swipe card to release the cable and take in her goods. She doesn't own the box, and it is automatically taken away the next day after she has unpacked all her shopping. </p> <p>Foks was hesitant about using the Homeport delivery service at first - until one occasion when she was stuck in Exeter and used it to order the ingredients for a dinner party. \"A box full of chicken breasts, sun-dried tomatoes and bottles of Rioja were waiting for me when I drove back,\" she says. The dinner party was saved and she was convinced that the Homeport was worth keeping. </p> <p>Homeport has been under development for three years. Initially the company built prototypes that involved complicated sets of padlocks and keys. But earlier this year it was introduced to card technology and its plan began to fall into place. An initial pilot scheme with fewer than 100 boxes has been running in London since September. </p> <p>\"There is quite a lot of inertia initially,\" says Mark Lunn of Homeport. \"It takes quite a lot of time and effort to get people to have one fitted, and once fitted, it then takes quite some time to get them to actually order, but once you have used one, people seem to use it every week.\" Only a third of people in the pilot scheme choose to order on the internet. The rest prefer phone and fax. About 10% have used the system for dry cleaning. </p> <p>\"We want to have an open system that can be used by many, many retailers and delivery companies,\" says Lunn. The company has already signed up with Jeeves of Belgravia, Food Ferry and Berry Brothers. Homeport started its first major trial with Sainsbury's on January 2. The scheme will be piloted in 50 postcode areas across London and the Thames Valley. An installation charge of \u00a330 will be waived for the pilot scheme. </p> <p>Apart from this fee, the use of the Homeport is free, save for the delivery costs that are usually added to online shopping bills. The retailers pay Homeport \u00a31 per delivery to use its boxes, and the hope is that the retailers will save money because they will be able to spread out deliveries through the day - or night - and, crucially, spend less time at each house. \"They can double park, plug in and be gone in three minutes,\" says Lunn. Traditional deliveries take about 10 minutes while the driver parks, rings the doorbell and politely delivers the goods. </p> <p>Homeport's main advantages are that it is flexible and cheap to install. But it is only the first generation of home-delivery boxes. Already, other more permanent boxes are being touted as potential rivals. Fellow start-ups Dynamid and BearBox are developing permanent cool boxes for the outside of houses. Both companies have tested 100 units each at homes around London in the run-up to Christmas and hope to launch fully by the spring. </p> <p>Of course, consumer confidence has to be built before any kind of secure box finds its way into every street in the UK. One obvious problem is security; another is getting the supermarkets to sign up. Sainsbury's has already announced a partnership with Homeport, but Tesco.com, the UK's largest online food retailer, says it is yet to be convinced that either home-delivery box system - removable or permanent - is reliable enough. Tesco claims that its customers (who spend around \u00a390 per shop) like to be around when their groceries arrive and, what's more, have built relationships with its delivery people. </p> <p>Whether we are really so fond of the man in the white van is debatable, but don't write off the out-of-town retail centre yet: the next big net retail scheme in the pipeline is rumoured to include drive-though pick-up points. As for Foks, she took herself and her two children to the supermarket last week \"just for a change\". </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.homeporthome.com\">Homeporthome</a><br><a href=\"http://www.dynamid.com\">Dynamid</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bearbox.com\">Bearbox</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Britain's Ministry of Defence announced a significant shift in policy this week by agreeing to conduct medical tests on tens of thousands of veterans from the Balkans wars for signs of contamination by depleted uranium (DU) used in tank-busting shells.</p> <p>The decision, which reverses the position held by ministers over the past decade, follows mounting pressure from ex-servicemen, MPs and Nato allies across Europe. However, the announcement infuriated Gulf war veterans, whose supporters labelled the refusal to offer the tests to troops in previous conflicts a \"vicious injustice\".</p> <p>Both the European Union and Nato are to discuss the growing controversy this week after the EU announced it would hold an inquiry into the health risks of DU weapons. Fears that there could be a link have risen following a spate of reports from Italy, France, Belgium and Portugal where troops who served in Kosovo and Bosnia have been diagnosed with cancer, particularly leukaemia.</p> <p>Depleted uranium is used in the nose of armour-piercing shells because its density helps it to punch through modern tanks. More than 100,000 DU rounds were fired during the Gulf war. In Kosovo more than 30,000 rounds were fired by United States A10 tankbuster planes; about 10,000 shells were fired in the area surrounding Sarajevo in the closing stages of the Bosnian conflict.</p> <p>Announcing the u-turn, the British armed forces minister, John Spellar, insisted there was no evidence linking DU shells to ill-health. He said they provided a \"battle-winning military capability\".</p> <p>Malcolm Hooper, emeritus professor of medicinal chemistry at Sunderland University, described the MoD's refusal to extend the tests to troops who took part in the 1991 Gulf war, where far more controversial weapons were fired than in the Balkans, as a \"cynical betrayal\" and \"vicious injustice\".</p> <p>The MoD's change of heart is partly designed to head off demands for compulsory screening by the Commons defence committee whose chairman, Bruce George, accused the MoD this week of \"foot-dragging\" over testing Gulf war veterans.</p> <p>Meanwhile a United Nations environmental study last week called for Nato to dispose of large fragments of DU ammunition remaining in Kosovo 18 months after the conflict ended because they represent an unnecessary risk to health.</p> <p>The European Commission president, Romano Prodi, called for DU-coated shells to be banned after the French defence ministry said that four French soldiers who served in the Balkans during Nato's bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 were being treated for leukaemia in a military hospital.</p> <p>At the same time Italy's military watchdog officially linked the leukaemia deaths of five Italian peacekeepers who served in Kosovo to exposure to the heavy metal. \"If there is even a minimal risk, these arms must be abolished,\" Mr Prodi said. \"And even if this risk was not there, I don't like the idea of using these particular weapons.\"</p> <p>The German chancellor, Gerhard Schrsder, joined the ranks of senior European leaders demanding a full investigation into the use of DU shells. \"We want a complete examination of where these munitions have been used and with what consequences,\" he said. \"We want to know if there are connections between cases of illness and the use of these weapons.\"</p> <p>Mr Schrsder said he would support Italy's demand that Nato provide full information on where DU ammunition was used. Nato, backed by the US and Britain, the only two countries to use the weapons, insists DU shells cause no significant risk.</p> <p>The MoD acknowledges that toxic dust is harmful if inhaled or ingested in large quantities, but a spokesman said it did not believe the shells posed \"any significant health risk\".</p> <p>However, according to research by one British expert, radioactive dust from DU weapons remains in the atmosphere at potentially dangerous levels for up to a decade after their use.</p> <p>The results of Dr Chris Busby's tests on Gulf war battlefields contradict advice produced by British, American and Nato defence chiefs, who insist that the radioactive dust produced on impact quickly disperses to safe levels, posing \"negligible risk\".</p> <p>Dr Busby carried out research in the battlefields of southern Iraq, where air samples he took revealed levels of ionising radiation in the atmosphere 10 times higher than in the nearby city of Basra and 20 times higher than in Baghdad. The Iraqi authorities have long claimed that childhood leukaemias and birth defects have risen sharply in the area.

      "bodyText": "Britain's Ministry of Defence announced a significant shift in policy this week by agreeing to conduct medical tests on tens of thousands of veterans from the Balkans wars for signs of contamination by depleted uranium (DU) used in tank-busting shells. The decision, which reverses the position held by ministers over the past decade, follows mounting pressure from ex-servicemen, MPs and Nato allies across Europe. However, the announcement infuriated Gulf war veterans, whose supporters labelled the refusal to offer the tests to troops in previous conflicts a \"vicious injustice\". Both the European Union and Nato are to discuss the growing controversy this week after the EU announced it would hold an inquiry into the health risks of DU weapons. Fears that there could be a link have risen following a spate of reports from Italy, France, Belgium and Portugal where troops who served in Kosovo and Bosnia have been diagnosed with cancer, particularly leukaemia. Depleted uranium is used in the nose of armour-piercing shells because its density helps it to punch through modern tanks. More than 100,000 DU rounds were fired during the Gulf war. In Kosovo more than 30,000 rounds were fired by United States A10 tankbuster planes; about 10,000 shells were fired in the area surrounding Sarajevo in the closing stages of the Bosnian conflict. Announcing the u-turn, the British armed forces minister, John Spellar, insisted there was no evidence linking DU shells to ill-health. He said they provided a \"battle-winning military capability\". Malcolm Hooper, emeritus professor of medicinal chemistry at Sunderland University, described the MoD's refusal to extend the tests to troops who took part in the 1991 Gulf war, where far more controversial weapons were fired than in the Balkans, as a \"cynical betrayal\" and \"vicious injustice\". The MoD's change of heart is partly designed to head off demands for compulsory screening by the Commons defence committee whose chairman, Bruce George, accused the MoD this week of \"foot-dragging\" over testing Gulf war veterans. Meanwhile a United Nations environmental study last week called for Nato to dispose of large fragments of DU ammunition remaining in Kosovo 18 months after the conflict ended because they represent an unnecessary risk to health. The European Commission president, Romano Prodi, called for DU-coated shells to be banned after the French defence ministry said that four French soldiers who served in the Balkans during Nato's bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 were being treated for leukaemia in a military hospital. At the same time Italy's military watchdog officially linked the leukaemia deaths of five Italian peacekeepers who served in Kosovo to exposure to the heavy metal. \"If there is even a minimal risk, these arms must be abolished,\" Mr Prodi said. \"And even if this risk was not there, I don't like the idea of using these particular weapons.\" The German chancellor, Gerhard Schrsder, joined the ranks of senior European leaders demanding a full investigation into the use of DU shells. \"We want a complete examination of where these munitions have been used and with what consequences,\" he said. \"We want to know if there are connections between cases of illness and the use of these weapons.\" Mr Schrsder said he would support Italy's demand that Nato provide full information on where DU ammunition was used. Nato, backed by the US and Britain, the only two countries to use the weapons, insists DU shells cause no significant risk. The MoD acknowledges that toxic dust is harmful if inhaled or ingested in large quantities, but a spokesman said it did not believe the shells posed \"any significant health risk\". However, according to research by one British expert, radioactive dust from DU weapons remains in the atmosphere at potentially dangerous levels for up to a decade after their use. The results of Dr Chris Busby's tests on Gulf war battlefields contradict advice produced by British, American and Nato defence chiefs, who insist that the radioactive dust produced on impact quickly disperses to safe levels, posing \"negligible risk\". Dr Busby carried out research in the battlefields of southern Iraq, where air samples he took revealed levels of ionising radiation in the atmosphere 10 times higher than in the nearby city of Basra and 20 times higher than in Baghdad. The Iraqi authorities have long claimed that childhood leukaemias and birth defects have risen sharply in the area. Special report on DU weapons at http://www.theguardian.com/uranium/",

      "bodyText": "Health secretary Alan Milburn has backed measures to strengthen the independence of the patient \"voice\" in the NHS, in a bid to head off criticisms of his plans to abolish community health councils (CHCs). Mr Milburn said he will support the creation of an national NHS patients' organisation to provide a powerful independent voice for the hundreds of disparate patient lobby groups around the UK. He has also promised to set up local independent patient advocacy groups - possibly run by local authorities - to help patients make formal complaints against health bodies. Mr Milburn said he wanted the new patient complaints system to be \"much more independent\" than the existing system, under which complaints are handled by the NHS body being complained about. But he has made it clear he has no intention of reversing controversial plans to get rid of CHCs - the existing local patient \"watchdog\" body - despite opposition from several Labour backbenchers, as well as the opposition parties. Speaking during the second reading of the health and social care bill in parliament last night, Mr Milburn said people should not be \"conservative\" about retaining CHCs, but consider what was best for patients. \"No organisation has a God-given right to exist. Governments do not a God-given right to exist. CHCs do not have a God-given right to exist,\" he told MPs. But David Hinchliffe, a Labour backbencher and chair of the Common's health committee, said the government's proposals to replace CHCs with a range of patient advocacy forums failed to offer \"proper independence and fairness\". He said: \"I feel that what is being proposed is clumsy and confusingpeople are baffled by the complexity of what is on offer now and I think that we are making the system even more complex.\" The national patient's organisation, which is expected to be established in March, is billed as an \"independent\" consumer body although it will be funded by the Department of Health (DoH). It will provide training and support for patient representatives on local health bodies, help spread good practice on patient involvement and lobby ministers on policy matters. The idea emerged from discussions on the NHS plan held in November by the Long Term Medical Conditions Alliance (LTMCA), the College of Health and the Patient's Forum. Judy Wilson, chief executive of the LTMCA, said it would help build up skills and capacity to ensure that the patient voice on hospital and primary care group boards was effective. She said she was confident that the proposed organisation's independence would not be compromised as a result of being funded by the DoH. \"We are quite good in the voluntary sector at retaining our independence, although one of the issues we shall have to look at is the funding base and the need for independence. One should not make the assumption that funding means control,\" she said.

It shows one child smugly clutching a huge Christmas parcel with another bawling at the size of his more modest gift. But users of such sites cannot assume they are getting accurate, unbiased information. </p> <p> Comparison shopping sites should be a boon for those wanting to buy online.

ShopSmart, which according to web ratings agency MMXI Europe received 490,000 unique visitors last October, also offers reviews of items such as CDs. You can then click straight through to your chosen shop, saving much mouse-work. </p> <p> It seems a great idea: but buyer, beware. Both ShopSmart and Kelkoo charge retailers a referral fee for that final click- through. No one will reveal the exact value, but Alexander Broich, UK managing director of online book and music retailer Bol.com, describes it as \"more than pennies, but below a pound\". Broich says he's happy to pay this fee, because someone who has chosen Bol from the list is ready to buy. This makes it a more efficient way of snaring paying customers than blanket advertising, he adds. </p> <p> Indirectly, the fees charged by the comparison engines are paid by customers. Of course that can be said of all kinds of advertising, and retailers do not charge comparison site users more than those who come straight to their website. But the fees do lead some retailers to reject the comparison sites. \"We try to avoid them like the plague,\" says Steve Bennett, chief executive of technology and music retailer <a href=\"http://www.Jungle.com\" target=\"_new\">Jungle.com</a>. </p> <p>But he adds: \"You can't stop them coming to your site.\" Both ShopSmart and Kelkoo list Jungle products. When questioned on this, Kelkoo admitted it was listing Jungle for free, in the hope of cutting a deal with the Midlands-based retailer this year. ShopSmart said it does collect fees from Jungle, although Jungle insists its deal with the comparison site has lapsed.</p> <p> Regardless of exceptions, the fees mean retailers with the keenest prices may well not be in the comparison list. And results differ widely. A search of these three comparison sites for two recently-released CDs produced no fewer than five different \"cheapest\" prices. When asked to search for U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind , ShopSmart and Kelkoo both identified 101CD.com as the cheapest retailer, at \u00a39.99 including postage. EasyValue concluded that CDShop.com was the cheapest, at \u00a310.75 inclusive. </p> <p> These are not bad savings when compared with high street prices of \u00a312.99 or \u00a313.99. But an observant user of Kelkoo's site might notice a small advert for retailer CD-Wow.com, selling titles including the U2 album for \u00a38.99 inclusive. </p> <p> \"In some situations, we may not always have them in the comparison engine, but may build them up through other promotions,\" says Brad Monaghan, UK head of commercial operations for Kelkoo, when asked why CD-Wow can advertise, but not get listed in comparisons. Monaghan says Kelkoo restricts its comparisons to retailers that have passed standards involving security of transactions and product guarantees - as well as a willingness to pay its fees, of course. ShopSmart has a similar set of standards, and says it is aiming to cut the number of retailers it uses.</p> <p> Both have removed retailers after receiving complaints. EasyValue says it would in principle. There is something in this idea of quality control: CD-Wow delivered the \u00a38.99 U2 album on the Wednesday morning after a Friday night order, but it came from Hong Kong - and lacked a bonus track available to UK shoppers. To be fair, CD-Wow did respond promptly to a complaint, offering a full refund with a UK return address. </p> <p> The three comparison sites came up with three different answers when searching for the Beatles' Christmas cash-in compilation, 1 . Kelkoo said the lowest price was from Amazon.co.uk, at \u00a311.47 including delivery - but Amazon's actual total price is \u00a311.73. ShopSmart recommended 101CD at \u00a310.99, and EasyValue thought that CDShop was the cheapest at \u00a310.75. This time, EasyValue got its prices right, but it had incorrectly priced the U2 album from 101CD at \u00a310.99 - meaning price-conscious customers would have missed the best bargain and paid 76p more than they needed. </p> <p>The difference may not be much, but what's the point of comparing if the prices used are wrong? Both Kelkoo and EasyValue were thrown by postage and packing charges. Lyndon Hearn, head of technology for Kelkoo UK, passed the query to the firm's team of checkers in Grenoble, and a few hours later called back with the answer: Amazon.co.uk's list of delivery prices does not include VAT, hence the 26p discrepancy. \"It just highlights the problems we have on the internet,\" says Hearn, who corrected the glitch as a result of Online's query. </p> <p> The problem stems from one of the ways used by Kelkoo to gather prices. It prefers to collect the entire price-list including delivery charges once a day, either through the retailer sending a file, or by Kelkoo reading a specially-formatted web page on the retailer's site. \"If the merchant has got some time for us and we've got a strong deal, we do it that way,\" says Hearn.</p> <p> But with Amazon, Kelkoo uses software that browses its website as if it were a customer gathering prices. This can lead to mistakes or no data if Amazon changes the format of web pages, or as in this case where the rules for charging are wrongly programmed by Kelkoo. EasyValue's mistake, which the firm says it is correcting, came from a similar assumption: its systems were set to assume 101CD charged \u00a31 postage on all items. In fact, as a special offer, the U2 album was free of delivery charges.</p> <p> Normally, EasyValue relies on software which scans the web pages of retailers - which Kelkoo has found the less accurate way of gathering price information. On the plus side, EasyValue does not try to insist that retailers in its comparison site pay referral fees. \"The other [comparison sites] tend to be walled gardens, as they only offer those with whom they have an agreement,\" says James Rothnie, director of corporate affairs for EasyGroup.</p> <p> EasyValue plans to make money by providing enhanced listings to those willing to pay fees, rather like bold-type entries in a tele phone directory. EasyGroup, run by internet enthusiast Stelios Haji-Ioannou, has been famous for reducing prices at its airline EasyJet partly by taking three-quarters of bookings through the web. The group's recently-launched car rental business EasyRentacar only takes bookings online. </p> <p>In both cases, prices are reduced by cutting out travel agents, who charge commission, and even telephone operators, who cost more for each transaction than a computer. So why is EasyValue trying to make money from putting a layer back between the customer and the retailer? </p> <p> Rothnie says that sometimes customers need advice. This doesn't apply to booking a short flight within Europe, which is why EasyJet doesn't deal with travel agents. \"But if you're travelling to Australia and staying in hotels, then travel agents can provide value, although they charge money [through commissions],\" he says. Automated shopping should have a great future, according to Ian Lynch, a director of analyst firm Butler. He says shopping software agents, sometimes known as robots or bots, will negotiate with similarly computerised sellers to strike the best deals, having been pre-programmed by their users.</p> <p> \"What's going to make them more interesting is when they have game theory built in, so you can release a bot into an auction to act on your behalf,\" says Lynch. A simple example can be seen on auction site QXL.com, where sellers enter both a start price and a secret reserve, below which an item will not be sold. Buyers can enter a secret maximum bid. If another buyer bids for an item, the first buyer's shopping robot matches the bid automatically, up to the maximum. Jungle's Steve Bennett has an alternative vision, of comparison shopping sites acting like consumer champions. \"If they were more professional, placed test orders, and rated retailers' abilities, then we would be very interested,\" he says, adding that price is usually just one factor when customers choose a shop. Lynch believes sites charging referral fees will need to think again: \"We don't think that's a sustainable business model,\" he says. </p> <p> However, he admits the current generation is better than nothing. \"As long as you don't expect them to be 100% accurate, they are a useful aid.\" The problem is that the advice of a comparison shopping site today may not be worth the pixels it is displayed on. EasyValue's fee-free approach looks like the way forward, but customers need to remember that automated processes for gathering information from retailer websites are fallible.</p>",

This makes it a more efficient way of snaring paying customers than blanket advertising, he adds. Indirectly, the fees charged by the comparison engines are paid by customers. Of course that can be said of all kinds of advertising, and retailers do not charge comparison site users more than those who come straight to their website. But the fees do lead some retailers to reject the comparison sites. \"We try to avoid them like the plague,\" says Steve Bennett, chief executive of technology and music retailer Jungle.com. But he adds: \"You can't stop them coming to your site.\" Both ShopSmart and Kelkoo list Jungle products. When questioned on this, Kelkoo admitted it was listing Jungle for free, in the hope of cutting a deal with the Midlands-based retailer this year. ShopSmart said it does collect fees from Jungle, although Jungle insists its deal with the comparison site has lapsed. Regardless of exceptions, the fees mean retailers with the keenest prices may well not be in the comparison list. And results differ widely. A search of these three comparison sites for two recently-released CDs produced no fewer than five different \"cheapest\" prices. When asked to search for U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind , ShopSmart and Kelkoo both identified 101CD.com as the cheapest retailer, at \u00a39.99 including postage. EasyValue concluded that CDShop.com was the cheapest, at \u00a310.75 inclusive. These are not bad savings when compared with high street prices of \u00a312.99 or \u00a313.99. But an observant user of Kelkoo's site might notice a small advert for retailer CD-Wow.com, selling titles including the U2 album for \u00a38.99 inclusive. \"In some situations, we may not always have them in the comparison engine, but may build them up through other promotions,\" says Brad Monaghan, UK head of commercial operations for Kelkoo, when asked why CD-Wow can advertise, but not get listed in comparisons. Monaghan says Kelkoo restricts its comparisons to retailers that have passed standards involving security of transactions and product guarantees - as well as a willingness to pay its fees, of course. ShopSmart has a similar set of standards, and says it is aiming to cut the number of retailers it uses. Both have removed retailers after receiving complaints. EasyValue says it would in principle. There is something in this idea of quality control: CD-Wow delivered the \u00a38.99 U2 album on the Wednesday morning after a Friday night order, but it came from Hong Kong - and lacked a bonus track available to UK shoppers. To be fair, CD-Wow did respond promptly to a complaint, offering a full refund with a UK return address. The three comparison sites came up with three different answers when searching for the Beatles' Christmas cash-in compilation, 1 . Kelkoo said the lowest price was from Amazon.co.uk, at \u00a311.47 including delivery - but Amazon's actual total price is \u00a311.73. ShopSmart recommended 101CD at \u00a310.99, and EasyValue thought that CDShop was the cheapest at \u00a310.75. This time, EasyValue got its prices right, but it had incorrectly priced the U2 album from 101CD at \u00a310.99 - meaning price-conscious customers would have missed the best bargain and paid 76p more than they needed. The difference may not be much, but what's the point of comparing if the prices used are wrong? Both Kelkoo and EasyValue were thrown by postage and packing charges. Lyndon Hearn, head of technology for Kelkoo UK, passed the query to the firm's team of checkers in Grenoble, and a few hours later called back with the answer: Amazon.co.uk's list of delivery prices does not include VAT, hence the 26p discrepancy. \"It just highlights the problems we have on the internet,\" says Hearn, who corrected the glitch as a result of Online's query. The problem stems from one of the ways used by Kelkoo to gather prices. It prefers to collect the entire price-list including delivery charges once a day, either through the retailer sending a file, or by Kelkoo reading a specially-formatted web page on the retailer's site. \"If the merchant has got some time for us and we've got a strong deal, we do it that way,\" says Hearn. But with Amazon, Kelkoo uses software that browses its website as if it were a customer gathering prices. This can lead to mistakes or no data if Amazon changes the format of web pages, or as in this case where the rules for charging are wrongly programmed by Kelkoo. EasyValue's mistake, which the firm says it is correcting, came from a similar assumption: its systems were set to assume 101CD charged \u00a31 postage on all items. In fact, as a special offer, the U2 album was free of delivery charges. Normally, EasyValue relies on software which scans the web pages of retailers - which Kelkoo has found the less accurate way of gathering price information. On the plus side, EasyValue does not try to insist that retailers in its comparison site pay referral fees. \"The other [comparison sites] tend to be walled gardens, as they only offer those with whom they have an agreement,\" says James Rothnie, director of corporate affairs for EasyGroup. EasyValue plans to make money by providing enhanced listings to those willing to pay fees, rather like bold-type entries in a tele phone directory. EasyGroup, run by internet enthusiast Stelios Haji-Ioannou, has been famous for reducing prices at its airline EasyJet partly by taking three-quarters of bookings through the web. The group's recently-launched car rental business EasyRentacar only takes bookings online. In both cases, prices are reduced by cutting out travel agents, who charge commission, and even telephone operators, who cost more for each transaction than a computer. So why is EasyValue trying to make money from putting a layer back between the customer and the retailer? Rothnie says that sometimes customers need advice. This doesn't apply to booking a short flight within Europe, which is why EasyJet doesn't deal with travel agents. \"But if you're travelling to Australia and staying in hotels, then travel agents can provide value, although they charge money [through commissions],\" he says. Automated shopping should have a great future, according to Ian Lynch, a director of analyst firm Butler. He says shopping software agents, sometimes known as robots or bots, will negotiate with similarly computerised sellers to strike the best deals, having been pre-programmed by their users. \"What's going to make them more interesting is when they have game theory built in, so you can release a bot into an auction to act on your behalf,\" says Lynch. A simple example can be seen on auction site QXL.com, where sellers enter both a start price and a secret reserve, below which an item will not be sold. Buyers can enter a secret maximum bid. If another buyer bids for an item, the first buyer's shopping robot matches the bid automatically, up to the maximum. Jungle's Steve Bennett has an alternative vision, of comparison shopping sites acting like consumer champions. \"If they were more professional, placed test orders, and rated retailers' abilities, then we would be very interested,\" he says, adding that price is usually just one factor when customers choose a shop. Lynch believes sites charging referral fees will need to think again: \"We don't think that's a sustainable business model,\" he says. However, he admits the current generation is better than nothing. \"As long as you don't expect them to be 100% accurate, they are a useful aid.\" The problem is that the advice of a comparison shopping site today may not be worth the pixels it is displayed on. EasyValue's fee-free approach looks like the way forward, but customers need to remember that automated processes for gathering information from retailer websites are fallible.",

      "body": "<p>In the last decades of the colonial era, British and French scientists working on the south side of the Sahara expressed concern that the desert was spreading inexorably southwards into the savannas and forests of west Africa.</p> <p>One of them, a French forester called Aubr\u00e9ville, called the process of spreading deserts, \"desertification\". Since that time, interest in the phenomenon has grown hugely, so that by 1977 there was an international conference in Nairobi under the auspices of the United Nations. </p> <p>The UN environment programme took up combating desertification as a major part of its work. In the 1990s it argued that desertification threatened nearly one quarter of the land surface of the globe.</p> <p>The environmental impacts of desertification include a reduction in crop yields, a loss of plants and a deterioration in the quality of plant foodstuffs available to human and animals. </p> <p>A lowering of the water table decreases water availability, sand dunes encroach, and winds can generate damaging dust storms, blowing away previously productive soils. </p> <p>In addition, remaining soils can become saline when the heat of the sun evaporates moisture, leaving toxic salts behind. </p> <p>Desertification is a form of land degradation. Unfortunately, geographers still have few firm data on the rate at which desertification is occurring, and there is some controversy over the way that desert-like conditions spread. </p> <p>Contrary to popular misconception, it does not happen over a broad front, like a wave overwhelming a beach. Rather it is like a rash, tending to appear in local patches around wells, roads, settlements and other intensively used areas. </p> <p>The distinction is important because it influences perceptions of how land managers tackle the problem of desertification. </p> <p>There is also debate on the causes. There are those who believe that climate change is responsible - and it is true that in the Sahel states of West Africa a prolonged dry period has persisted since the 1960s.</p> <p>These years have led to enormous problems with respect to water supply and vegetation availability for food and animal grazing.

      "bodyText": "In the last decades of the colonial era, British and French scientists working on the south side of the Sahara expressed concern that the desert was spreading inexorably southwards into the savannas and forests of west Africa. One of them, a French forester called Aubr\u00e9ville, called the process of spreading deserts, \"desertification\". Since that time, interest in the phenomenon has grown hugely, so that by 1977 there was an international conference in Nairobi under the auspices of the United Nations. The UN environment programme took up combating desertification as a major part of its work. In the 1990s it argued that desertification threatened nearly one quarter of the land surface of the globe. The environmental impacts of desertification include a reduction in crop yields, a loss of plants and a deterioration in the quality of plant foodstuffs available to human and animals. A lowering of the water table decreases water availability, sand dunes encroach, and winds can generate damaging dust storms, blowing away previously productive soils. In addition, remaining soils can become saline when the heat of the sun evaporates moisture, leaving toxic salts behind. Desertification is a form of land degradation. Unfortunately, geographers still have few firm data on the rate at which desertification is occurring, and there is some controversy over the way that desert-like conditions spread. Contrary to popular misconception, it does not happen over a broad front, like a wave overwhelming a beach. Rather it is like a rash, tending to appear in local patches around wells, roads, settlements and other intensively used areas. The distinction is important because it influences perceptions of how land managers tackle the problem of desertification. There is also debate on the causes. There are those who believe that climate change is responsible - and it is true that in the Sahel states of West Africa a prolonged dry period has persisted since the 1960s. These years have led to enormous problems with respect to water supply and vegetation availability for food and animal grazing. However, there are many other areas on the margins of the world's deserts with no evidence of a downward trend in rainfall. In these areas, pressures exerted by human populations are the root cause; deforestation, overgrazing, over irrigation, over cultivation, and other overexploitation. In the minds of some, desertification is a problem for the developing countries. Again, it is true that some of the poorest countries in the world, like those of the Sahel zone in Africa, are suffering from severe land degradation over substantial areas. Nevertheless, it is also a severe problem in some of the world's most advanced countries. In the United States of America, insatiable demands for water in the form of the spread of large irrigation schemes and burgeoning recreation have led to accelerated wind erosion in the High Plains. These pressures have also caused the desiccation of lakes such as Owens Lake in California. The 1930's American Dust Bowl is a well-documented developed-world example of land degradation under the pressure of inappropriate land-use and cycles of drought. There are technological solutions to some desertification problems. There are many ways available to control wind erosion on the ground , including the planting of trees as shelter belts. Likewise, farmers can control water erosion by methods such as hillside terracing. Terraces hold rainfall runoff until it sinks in, rather than letting it flow uninterrupted down the hill. But it is much more difficult to make changes in the human conditions, and those are the root causes of the problem. Population growth, poverty, political instability, poor planning, the attitudes of urban elites, and the breakdown of traditional nomadic societies to static populations are among the basic human issues that need to be addressed to combat desertification. The impact of desertification has global ramifications. The increase in dust storms over Sahelian Africa may affect the clarity of the atmosphere over extensive areas of the North Atlantic. This in turn may affect the receipt of heat from the sun at the surface of the earth and even the formation of raindrops. Similarly areas that have been stripped of their plant cover may reflect much more of the incoming heat from the sun, and this can have knock-on effects to regional climates. Research by the UK Met Office's Hadley Centre in Bracknell has shown that the world's drylands that will tend to suffer the greatest reductions in water availability with global warming. As temperatures increase, most soil water is lost by evaporation but, in addition, the main rainfall belts will also shift. Some areas, like the interior of southern Africa, may see a reduction of over 60% of flow in their streams. If this is the case then the world's deserts will indeed expand further, and desertification will affect more of the world's population. \u2022 Andrew Goudie is professor of Geography at Oxford university.

If the same is true of institutions, then a large swathe of the Japanese bureaucracy will be in a state of shock this week after the biggest shake-up of the country's civil service in more than 100 years. Tens of thousands of officials were given a new home last Saturday with the introduction of a revamped administrative structure aimed at guiding the nation into an era of small government led by politicians rather than bureaucrats. To kick off a staggered ten-year reform, the number of ministries has been slashed from 23 to 13, more than half the 211 advisory bodies have disappeared and greater power has been concentrated in the cabinet office. In theory at least, this should allow the prime minister to exercise the leadership that Japan has been sorely lacking over the past 10 years.

      "body": "<p>Worst present came this Christmas, and was from my wife to add to the insult. I resolved that from Xmas eve I was going to give up smoking. My present - a lovely tobacco tin engraved with my initials. She said she had ordered it months ago and couldn't send it back as it was personalised! <br><strong>John Marlow </strong></p> <p>My worst pressie was all the extra weight and cellulite I now have to shift throughout the year after well meaning people bought me tonnes of chocolate and biscuits! <br><strong>Claire Gibbs </strong></p> <p>My husband is an expert in buying the strangest pressies! This year I received a Barbie Doll, complete with hundreds of tiny beads to put in her long blonde hair, little brushes, combs etc. She is currently wearing purple knee length boots and a wild multi-coloured dress!! This would have been a dream present when I was younger but not at age 31!! <br><strong>Delly Johnson</strong></p> <p>My worst Christmas presents this year were; one of those cheap little helicopters that flies round in circles suspended from the ceiling. Seven boxes of chocolates (everyone in the family knows that I am allergic to milk and dairy products) and a \u00a310 voucher to an online furniture shop. When I looked up the store on the net I found that the cheapest item available was \u00a3200. I think that I will pass up this offer! <br><strong> Dave Brown </strong></p> <p>I'm sure that my mother has finally hit the menopause. I asked last year for a cheap watch for work (I'm 28). On Christmas Day I unwrapped the gift to find a round tin. Inside this was a watch, but no ordinary one. This was special, with just the press of a button the face moved up by aid of hydraulic pistons. You could not see the time as it was obscured by the pistons. My partner made me wear it and has ridiculed me ever since. One year went by and so at last I could dispose of it at the local charity shop. <br><strong>James Baker </strong></p> <p>Last Xmas, we had a big family-do with my auntie, cousin and my auntie's grand-children coming over from France. Before Christmas, my mum had said to me on the phone: \"I think your Auntie got you a very special present. It's something you've always wanted\". ?? Excellent I thought...was I getting the laptop of my dreams? Naa...probably too expensive. A horse? That for sure was my life dream. Mum back on phone: \"It's something you spotted at her house when you were a child (I'm 32 thank you!) and now she finally decided to give it to you!\" Oh my God! This was starting to get pretty scarey...was it a horrible old-fashioned cushion, one of the few remains of a long-forgotten doll? I really hadn't a clue!!</p> <p> When Christmas came, I was pretty excited but even more intrigued. At last I was going to know what I had been longing for in my childhood...There it was wrapped in bright red paper with the label \"Happy Christmas. You have been wanting this for so long!\" This was too much...I ripped the paper off and there it was in it's pencil-case like plastic box....an old huge cigar!!!! A CIGAR!!! I'm not even a smoker! And how the hell could I have been praying to get this when I was a kid ??? An old, not-even-famous-mark cigar that had apparently been bought in Switzerland by my now-deceased Uncle!! I tried to solve the mystery but to that day, only my Auntie ever heard me claiming I wanted The cigar...although she now reckons she might have got it wrong and got confused with my other Uncle...Still, this cigar made me and everyone else enjoy the most laughable Christmas morning. I have still got a picture of my puzzled face, and as for the cigar? Well it is well kept in a drawer and I am impatiently waiting for my niece to be 32 before giving it to her...in 10 years time! <br><strong>Catherine Thieffry </strong></p> <p>The worst present received at Christmas is usually something you have never, ever wished to own or something you own several hundred times over. NOT IN MY CASE. Wanting to try and keep up-to-date with the gadgets of today, I wished for a digital camera. My wife, never showing any interest in anything related to a computer, actually found one which seemed so much cheaper than what I had tried to budget for.</p> <p>Now this digital camera must have been designed before Kodak had perfected their Brownie - somebody had never thought it might be a good idea to allow for changing the focus. The result is a mass of colours, nicely blending into one another, which resemble the neck of the Christmas turkey. There is a bonus though - it is impossible to identify a picture of King Kong from one of the mother-in-law. <br><strong>Alan Edgar </strong></p> <p>A BUMPER COLOURING BOOK. I'm a 39 year old professional and it was sad. It showed my aunt's ageing problems, she had been so bright. Sadder still was the pleasure I got from it when it was placed next to the phone. I began to take pride in my colouring as I hung on the telephone waiting to talk to humans rather than the robotic call managers. <br><strong>Stewart </strong></p> <p>There is a saying we all know that goes a little something like this \"It's the thought that counts\". In most cases it's true and we hide our disappointment behind a painted smile. People harp on about those tacky socks and jumpers. But they happen to be useful on a cold winter nights. But there are people who buy Christmas presents with no thought at all, so that old saying goes straight out of the window. There is one present I was given by the modern day Mr Scrooge who happens to be my father, that still humours me and angers at the same time. </p> <p> My father never lived with us and my mother had to raise five children on her own. One Christmas Day as a small boy. I was thrilled at the prospect of opening my stocking and finding the little black and white TV that my father had promised. After opening my mothers' presents, I asked my mother where my fathers' presents were. \"On the coffee table!\" she replied.</p> <p>On the table sat a poorly wrapped object that was no bigger than a matchbox. I remember thinking \"This is too small to be a television\" and wondered what it was. On opening the present, inside was a porcelain thimble that had 'Welcome to Wales' and a little red dragon on it. I was heart broken and also confused as to 'What the hell is a nine year-old boy supposed to do with a thimble'. At first I thought it must be a joke, but months disappeared and so did the thimble. Hard to believe I know! But true. <br><strong>David Cannon </strong></p> <p>The worst present I received this year was from my mother in law. It was an electric can opener. My wife and I asked why she had bought us one and she said because my wife told her to. This puzzled me, for only two months earlier I went out and bought an electric can opener for the house !!!. <br><strong>Anonymous</strong></p> <p>The worst, unwanted present I have ever received was from my father - a fishing rod. Not only am I female (sorry, not trying to be sexist, just a bit squeamish over maggots). I am also allergic to fish, which my father knew. To top it all he kept it, even though he has never been fishing in his life. <br><strong>Gill Hampton </strong></p> <p>My aunt is quite a character and selecting presents is not one of her talents. Knowing this, my wife had been hinting to her for weeks for prezzies we would like; Body Shop products for her, a book for me and a particular learning activity toy for the baby. However, it wasn't just me, but the whole family who were given Christmas Turkeys one year (well, mine wasn't just a turkey.....it was an Ostrich!). My wife received a rack for holding spice jars and a spaghetti container (we had both already). My daughter received a pack of 3 baby grows aged 3 to 6 months. She was 7 months old at the time. And now for the real Christmas Turkey.... What did she buy for me? A toupee and clip on pony tail. She said she had noticed my hair loss over the past few months and \"you young men like pony tails\". It was obviously a joke set she had bought (although she didn't realise this) and I wasn't actually balding, I had my hair cut into a grade 2 by choice!!! <br><strong>Graham Kelsall </strong></p> <p>When I was 10 my gran knitted the most horrendous, unfashionable purple cardigan in acrylic wool with huge purple buttons she said I would grow. My gran has been dead for 3 years now, i am now 42 years old and a size 16 - it's still too big! <br><strong>Kathy Keegans </strong></p> <p>Not a present as such but I've not been happy about everyone having great slap-up dinners at Christmas while I'm fasting for Ramadam. <br><strong>Nadeem Faruque</strong></p> <p>Last year I received a Playstation console and played it all Christmas right up until the new year. Well because I liked the puzzle games last year so much, this year I was given a cobination padlock with no combination to amuse myself with. <br><strong>Michael Williams </strong></p> <p>It was this Christmas I recieved what I call a christmas turkey of a present. I am a bit of a gadget freak and every year I usually recieve a gadget or something which is usually realy usefull,of my wife. So this year she gave me this gift wrapped box, I opened it with excitement and inside was a picnic hamper, just what I have always wanted, never mind there is lways next year. <br><strong>P A Hunt </strong> </p> <p>I was having a relaxing time over Christmas with family having just broken my leg skiing. I am a keen runner and had always wanted a particular pair of running shoes but never been able to afford them. So, what do my brothers do - yep, they club together to buy them for me for Christmas, so now all I can do is look at them until my leg heals. <br><strong>Caroline Sayers </strong></p> <p>My auntie Madge, an eccentric but practical private mobile nurse, came back from holiday in Cornwall with my Christmas present on Christmas eve. Because she had to be on duty the next day she rushed round to exchange gifts that night. She apologised for being in a rush and for not wrapping mine up and handed me one of her infamous brown paper bags. On Christmas Day while she was on duty I telephoned her to thank her for the present, although amused at the unusual practical nature of her gift on this occasion. She burst in to laughter and informed me that Mr Tomlins whom she had visited earlier was really happy with the jars of preserves from Cornwall. I as not to dissapoint the old man Mr Tomlins had to be content, this year, with his specimen bottles. <br><strong>Naomi Towers </strong></p> <p>A few Christmases ago for some reason known only to her self, my wife's auntie alice sent us a magazine picture of the children's TV character barney the dinosaur as a genuine xmas present. I still haven't figured out why. <br><strong>Stevie Curry </strong></p> <p>Last Christmas my miserable grandmother gave me an ashtray (I don't smoke). Not such a bad present one might think, but it was the same one I gave to her three years earlier. (It wasn't even washed properly!) <br><strong>Mark Hollingsworth </strong></p> <p>I got an electric toothbrush from my dad, but that's proved useful! It pales compared to the massager \"device\" I also got form him.It looks like a computer mouse, and buzzes when pressed.But it doesn't massage anywhere in any useful way, because it's got a really weak pulse! The best use I've found is for entertaining my baby sister in law, who loved it and wouldn't let it go. <br><strong>Derrick Smith </strong></p> <p>I believe my Christmas gift from my dearest hubby must be the worst one ever! The jobs around the home had been building up and I kept complaining they never got done, and I remarked I would do the jobs myself if the power tools weren't so heavy and akward to use. His answer was he just didn't have the time and what little time he had he wanted to relax not turn into Handy-Andy! Christmas morning I awoke to a big box wrapped in lovely paper with a nice big bow, I was quite surprised and excited, that was until I got the paper off then my face was one of shock, yep my wonderful Christmas pressie was a Black and Decker Quattro. I wasn't sure if it was a joke at first and waited for him to give me my real gift but I realised it was no joke when he said \"I saw this and thought of you, now you will be able to do the jobs yourself\" Hmm..... I wonder what I'm getting for my birthday (the complete DIY book??) <br><strong>Dawn Sanders </strong></p> <p>This year my grandparents gave me 10 thermostatic valves for the radiators in my house!! <br><strong>Claire Dennis</strong></p> <p>The worst (and cheapest) present I ever had for Christmas was a bag of bright-green, scented rocks. The label read 'alternative to potpourri; suitable for smokers'. I don't smoke (and never have). The person who bought them must hate me a lot. <br><strong>Tony Nixon </strong></p> <p>This is going back about 10 years - I was about 15 (I'm not sure if that's cheating). I had a favourite aunt who always bought me very interesting Christmas presents. One year she bought me a lemon and a packet of sticking plasters. Nicely wrapped and everything. I'm not sure why she did it - I think she had had a rough year. Anyway, it didn't affect my opinion of her... I can't even remember thinking it strange until a few years later. <br> <strong>Suzi Wells </strong></p> <p>Please don't publish my name on this one. This year I got sent a wedding photo in a frame from a couple I'm friends with. I was unable to get to the wedding, so she thought this might make up for it in some way. The only problem is that I'm still totally in love with the man in question, it breaks my heart to look at the picture and I'm going to have to put it up somewhere so as not to offend them.<br><strong>Anonymous</strong></p> <p> My wife received a hair dryer as a Christmas present, from my mother, unfortunately. \"Not too bad,\" you may think, but it is identical to one she already has at home. Without offending my mother by asking her for the receipt, we decided to take the hair dryer back to Boots. The customer services woman was very helpful and said that it was no problem, she just had to scan the barcode to find the original price and give us vouchers to the same value. Imagine how embarrassed I was when she informed us that the hair dryer had been a free gift given with other goods bought earlier in the year. <br> <strong>Sean Lilliott </strong></p> <p> My mum and I had been collecting Coca-Cola ring pulls for the Coke auction. I had bid for a holiday but missed out by a couple of ring pulls, so I bought something else. Mum sent me the present at the start of December and there it was under the tree. Lo and behold, on Christmas day when I opened it up there were 700 ring pulls. As I had lost out on the holiday, my mum thought she would surprise me so that I could buy something else. I daren't tell her that it all finished on December 10. This was my main present too... <br> <strong>Craig Dearden </strong></p> <p>I was a touch surprised to find the new Vodaphone sponsored Man Utd shirt I had been waiting for had mysteriously metamorphosed into a silver pen with inbuilt lighter on Christmas morning. Very strange indeed, given that I can't wear a pen, and have a hundred lighters lying around the house and don't really need a fake silver one that writes. <br><strong>Luge Pravda</strong> </p> <p>My worst Christmas present ever: A years membership to 'slimmers world' from my (ex!)Boyfriend. <br><strong>Bernadette Hancock </strong></p> <p>Worst Christmas present actually arrived this year. A Playstation 2. \"Turkey?\" I hear you cry? My mother had pre-ordered it and collected it on release day in November (bless her), and then to keep it top secret she hid the PS2 in the loft. Where it suffered the variations in temperature that a lot of lofts are exposed to in Winter. So on Christmas Day when it was opened, firstly I was stunned that my mum would think of such a wonderful present for me, then stunned again whilst taking it out of its box and finding water trickling out of it. Now I can't get a replacement until March. Being a gaming addict, this is sheer torture. <br><strong>Michael Scoates </strong></p> <p>This year I received a vase which had been dropped, broken and super glued back together. This in itself would have warranted an entry at maybe number 8 on my all-time top 10 list of corking presents. What catapulted it to the top of the tree, however, was the fact that several vital pieces of pottery had obviously gone astray and the search had been called off due to a lack of resources. <br><strong>Andy</strong></p> <p>I seem to do very well or should I say badly out of naff Christmas presents. One was a very disgusting tortoise boot scraper and a man-made fibre jumper with very tasteful bunches of cherries on. Probably very popular in Eastern European states about 10 years ago. <br><strong>Matthew Pearl </strong> </p> <p>On the night before Christmas Eve I was driving home with some friends when a black cat darted out in front of the car and didn't quite make it. I stopped the car and got out to take a look but there was nothing I could do for it. I placed the cat on the side of the road and went on my way, all the while thinking about the poor feline and the people who would miss it. I woke up on Christmas morning, having nearly forgotten about the cat accident and went to open my presents with my family. After the usual presents of socks and toilet joke books I got to a shoebox size present. To my surprise (and horror) I found a pair of those oversize fun slippers in the style of two black cats. I was made to wear them but they soon became 'lost' on Boxing Day. <br><strong>Philip Sharp </strong></p> <p>I was 20 years old and had just started seeing this lad, we had been going out for about three months. Christmas day came and much to my amazement, he had bought me an encyclopaedia and a pair of pink suede, fur lined slippers! For Christmas, he received the ELBOW!! <br><strong>Kathryn Cox </strong></p> <p>On receiving a beautifully wrapped present from my husbands' grandmother I was well impressed. It was a lot larger and heavier than the usual gifts she had given me. So I duly put it under the festive tree and resolved that however much I wanted to peek I would resist the urge. Christmas morning (after the kids had opened their pressies) it was my turn! Usual gifts from Granny-in-law were bath salts (genuine victorian!) and a bale of tea towels..But that year she surpassed herself. I pick up the parcel only to discover that the wrapping and the carpet underneath were soaking wet and smelt dubious. I could not believe it when I open it to find a whole cooked chicken that was once frozen! I later found out that Gran had cooked the chicken for us and frozen it thinking that it would come in useful over Christmas. Still it's the thought that counts...not! This years present went straight in the freezer even though it turned out to be a cordless phone! <br><strong>Karen </strong></p> <p>For some people my Christmas presents this year would represent a slice of heaven. I received a total of 600 cigarettes (duty free of course) from my friends and family. Nothing else. Unfortunately I had foolishly given up, two weeks previously. As I was amused/shocked that so many people had the same idea but I had no other choice but to give them all away. <br><strong>Nalu </strong></p> <p>This year I was given a jazz CD, some coffee beans, and various other sundries from my Mom-in-law. Nice stuff, according to my wife, who had all these things on her list of desired gifts! <br><strong>K Belluz</strong></p> <p>My worst Christmas pressie that I can remember is getting the sound of Bread LP and when I opened it to play it on Christmas Day the wrong album was inside. It was Donny and Marie Osmond. <br><strong>Angela Williams </strong></p> <p>I am used to my mother giving me a pair of marigolds every year, but this year I really feel my whole family feel I have something lacking in my life. My sister sent me a second hand butter dish complete with receipt and my mother gave me a pack of dish cloths and a pack of floor cloths. She didn't even include the marigolds this year! <br><strong>Vanessa </strong></p> <p>My Grandmother is 92 years old. She looks like Margaret Rutherford and for the last 10 years has obviously decided to play up to her eccentric image by bestowing on her grandchildren some very odd gifts. Last year, I got a Haze air freshener. Very useful, except that I'm allergic to perfume. The year before, she gave me a model horse with only three legs. When I complained, she replied, 'What's the problem? It still looks like a horse, doesn't it?' This year, she promised me something nice. I got a golfing umbrella. Definitely an improvement, you might think...except it's the one she grabbed off me in June when I wheel-chaired her in the rain to a relative's funeral... <br><strong>Lesley Wilkinson </strong></p> <p>500 personalised address labels was probably the worst Christmas present I ever received.The phone number was wrong! <br><strong>Sue Nicholson</strong></p> <p>Going back a few years, my Grandmother (bless her), knowing I was a fanatical Newcastle United fan bought me the latest football shirt. She packaged the shirt for posting and sent it to me. A couple of days later and my postman arrived in pouring rain with my present. Unfortunately, my loving Grandmother had wrapped the shirt in red paper and the rain had made the red dye run onto the sacred black and white top. The result, a football shirt in the colours of Sunderland. Thanks Gran! <br><strong>Craig Anderson </strong></p> <p>It is a mistake for my mother to buy me presents: she lives exactly 423 miles away from me, and is 40 years my senior; we communicate, by phone, tersely, once a month. This year a parcel from her arrived which contained for a technophile like me the dubious gift of an Arthurian-themed address book, in which each letter of the alphabet was decorated with portraits and legends of the various knights of the round table, each page with William Morris bordering and panels. Preferring my WAP phone and laptop, this was not a good choice for me, so I forwarded it, re-wrapped, to a distant friend, who had once expressed modest enthusiasm for attending the Glastonbury Festival. At New Year my mother rang and asked if I liked my present and as I pondered various easy lies she interrupted me saying: \"I hope you noticed that I wrote my address in there - perhaps I'll get some letters from you this year!\" <br><strong>Paul McClure </strong></p> <p>My worst Christmas present ever was a set of wind chimes - but I have had the last laugh, I put them up outside the house on Boxing Day and boy are they driving everyone mad!! <br><strong>Paul Sharman</strong></p> <p>When I was about 13 years old I received the following from my mum for Christmas: school uniform, a satchel, and a geometry set. As you can guess I was disappointed. <br><strong>Kathy Spendel </strong></p> <p>A couple of years ago I fell in love with those tiny Ixus cameras - so compact, so stylish, so covetable! As my old camera was on its last legs, the ideal solution was at hand: convey to my ever-loving partner that this was to be my next Christmas present. Accordingly I seized every possible opportunity to point the camera's desirability out to him; drawing attention to newspaper adverts and stopping meaningfully in front of camera-shop windows, where I would rhapsodize about the perfection of the design and the fact that I longed to possess one. My big error was this: I didn't actually say BUY ME AN IXUS CAMERA. Come Christmas morning, he produced (with a flourish) an enormous parcel that must have measured about 4 feet by 1 foot. On unwrapping it I discovered a keyboard - yes, a keyboard - which I could plug into my computer and play as a digital piano. Apparently I had once, in the dim and distant past (so distant I couldn't even remember it) said something about wishing I'd learnt the piano as a child. <br><strong>Penny Gore </strong></p> <p>I bought my boyfriend an all-singing all-dancing top of the range DVD player and received a box of Milk Tray in return... <br><strong>Demir Sayiner </strong></p> <p>Come into my house and a singing plastic fish hanging in my hallway will greet you. If you get past that, watch out for the singing, dancing lobster that is sitting in front of the door reciting Otis Redding. In the main room, you'll discover a talking donkey that moans about the weather, perched next to a farting teddy bear that apologises profusely following its outbursts. All this is because I mentioned to a couple of people that I sometimes get lonely as a student. A new DVD or palm top would have eased the pain. Still, there's the birthday to come. <br><strong>Jason Wood </strong></p> <p> My worst ever gift was a petrol cap for my husband's car! It may have been my fault as I was always complaining that I couldn't undo the one on the car but insult was added to injury as this one came wrapped in the carrier bag from the motorists shop. <br> <strong>Anonymous</strong></p> <p>On Boxing Day we all go to my dear nana's and every year we never know what she's going to get us. She came into the living room as she always does dragging two white santa sacks, smiled and said \"santa's been!\" with the same silly grin. Me and my sister slowly turned our heads and laughed. We began opening out presents with my nana and granda looking on. After I had opened the usual bath bubbles and plastic beaded necklace, I came across a very small parcel in my treasures. \"It feel's like.....\" I said slowly peeling the paper \"IT'S A PLUG!\" I cried out laughing. \"AN ELECTRIC PLUG!\" Everyone else looked on in disbelief before joining in with the laughter. Nana just tapped her nose and said \"you won't be laughing in a minute\". I continued opening, afraid of what I would come across next. After a purse and a box of chocolates I saw nana's face light up when I pulled an oblong shaped parcel out of the bag. I took off the paper to reveal a battery recharger. Sure enough the thing didn't have a plug on the end. Again the room erupted in hysterics. I don't know which was the worst gift, the plug or the recharger.But it has come in useful for recharging my son's Christmas toys, considering I had to buy nearly 30 batteries I suppose it wasn't that useless after all......poor Nana! <br><strong>Madeline Gibson </strong></p> <p> My worst Christmas present ever has got to be a Shawaddywaddy single. <br> <strong>Ged Carroll </strong></p> <p>A 'hanging basket' kit - everything you would want to produce flowers in hanging baskets, including a guide book and special basket to get you started. For a 31 year old bloke with no interest in gardening, this was a prize turkey. <br> <strong> Adam Brooks </strong> </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.shoppingunlimited.co.uk/christmas/story/0,8167,422566,00.html\">Read more entries</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Worst present came this Christmas, and was from my wife to add to the insult. I resolved that from Xmas eve I was going to give up smoking. My present - a lovely tobacco tin engraved with my initials. She said she had ordered it months ago and couldn't send it back as it was personalised! John Marlow My worst pressie was all the extra weight and cellulite I now have to shift throughout the year after well meaning people bought me tonnes of chocolate and biscuits! Claire Gibbs My husband is an expert in buying the strangest pressies! This year I received a Barbie Doll, complete with hundreds of tiny beads to put in her long blonde hair, little brushes, combs etc. She is currently wearing purple knee length boots and a wild multi-coloured dress!! This would have been a dream present when I was younger but not at age 31!! Delly Johnson My worst Christmas presents this year were; one of those cheap little helicopters that flies round in circles suspended from the ceiling. Seven boxes of chocolates (everyone in the family knows that I am allergic to milk and dairy products) and a \u00a310 voucher to an online furniture shop. When I looked up the store on the net I found that the cheapest item available was \u00a3200. I think that I will pass up this offer! Dave Brown I'm sure that my mother has finally hit the menopause. I asked last year for a cheap watch for work (I'm 28). On Christmas Day I unwrapped the gift to find a round tin. Inside this was a watch, but no ordinary one. This was special, with just the press of a button the face moved up by aid of hydraulic pistons. You could not see the time as it was obscured by the pistons. My partner made me wear it and has ridiculed me ever since. One year went by and so at last I could dispose of it at the local charity shop. James Baker Last Xmas, we had a big family-do with my auntie, cousin and my auntie's grand-children coming over from France. Before Christmas, my mum had said to me on the phone: \"I think your Auntie got you a very special present. It's something you've always wanted\". ?? Excellent I thought...was I getting the laptop of my dreams? Naa...probably too expensive. A horse? That for sure was my life dream. Mum back on phone: \"It's something you spotted at her house when you were a child (I'm 32 thank you!) and now she finally decided to give it to you!\" Oh my God! This was starting to get pretty scarey...was it a horrible old-fashioned cushion, one of the few remains of a long-forgotten doll? I really hadn't a clue!! When Christmas came, I was pretty excited but even more intrigued. At last I was going to know what I had been longing for in my childhood...There it was wrapped in bright red paper with the label \"Happy Christmas. You have been wanting this for so long!\" This was too much...I ripped the paper off and there it was in it's pencil-case like plastic box....an old huge cigar!!!! A CIGAR!!! I'm not even a smoker! And how the hell could I have been praying to get this when I was a kid ??? An old, not-even-famous-mark cigar that had apparently been bought in Switzerland by my now-deceased Uncle!! I tried to solve the mystery but to that day, only my Auntie ever heard me claiming I wanted The cigar...although she now reckons she might have got it wrong and got confused with my other Uncle...Still, this cigar made me and everyone else enjoy the most laughable Christmas morning. I have still got a picture of my puzzled face, and as for the cigar? Well it is well kept in a drawer and I am impatiently waiting for my niece to be 32 before giving it to her...in 10 years time! Catherine Thieffry The worst present received at Christmas is usually something you have never, ever wished to own or something you own several hundred times over. NOT IN MY CASE. Wanting to try and keep up-to-date with the gadgets of today, I wished for a digital camera. My wife, never showing any interest in anything related to a computer, actually found one which seemed so much cheaper than what I had tried to budget for. Now this digital camera must have been designed before Kodak had perfected their Brownie - somebody had never thought it might be a good idea to allow for changing the focus. The result is a mass of colours, nicely blending into one another, which resemble the neck of the Christmas turkey. There is a bonus though - it is impossible to identify a picture of King Kong from one of the mother-in-law. Alan Edgar A BUMPER COLOURING BOOK. I'm a 39 year old professional and it was sad. It showed my aunt's ageing problems, she had been so bright. Sadder still was the pleasure I got from it when it was placed next to the phone. I began to take pride in my colouring as I hung on the telephone waiting to talk to humans rather than the robotic call managers. Stewart There is a saying we all know that goes a little something like this \"It's the thought that counts\". In most cases it's true and we hide our disappointment behind a painted smile. People harp on about those tacky socks and jumpers. But they happen to be useful on a cold winter nights. But there are people who buy Christmas presents with no thought at all, so that old saying goes straight out of the window. There is one present I was given by the modern day Mr Scrooge who happens to be my father, that still humours me and angers at the same time. My father never lived with us and my mother had to raise five children on her own. One Christmas Day as a small boy. I was thrilled at the prospect of opening my stocking and finding the little black and white TV that my father had promised. After opening my mothers' presents, I asked my mother where my fathers' presents were. \"On the coffee table!\" she replied. On the table sat a poorly wrapped object that was no bigger than a matchbox. I remember thinking \"This is too small to be a television\" and wondered what it was. On opening the present, inside was a porcelain thimble that had 'Welcome to Wales' and a little red dragon on it. I was heart broken and also confused as to 'What the hell is a nine year-old boy supposed to do with a thimble'. At first I thought it must be a joke, but months disappeared and so did the thimble. Hard to believe I know! But true. David Cannon The worst present I received this year was from my mother in law. It was an electric can opener. My wife and I asked why she had bought us one and she said because my wife told her to. This puzzled me, for only two months earlier I went out and bought an electric can opener for the house !!!. Anonymous The worst, unwanted present I have ever received was from my father - a fishing rod. Not only am I female (sorry, not trying to be sexist, just a bit squeamish over maggots). I am also allergic to fish, which my father knew. To top it all he kept it, even though he has never been fishing in his life. Gill Hampton My aunt is quite a character and selecting presents is not one of her talents. Knowing this, my wife had been hinting to her for weeks for prezzies we would like; Body Shop products for her, a book for me and a particular learning activity toy for the baby. However, it wasn't just me, but the whole family who were given Christmas Turkeys one year (well, mine wasn't just a turkey.....it was an Ostrich!). My wife received a rack for holding spice jars and a spaghetti container (we had both already). My daughter received a pack of 3 baby grows aged 3 to 6 months. She was 7 months old at the time. And now for the real Christmas Turkey.... What did she buy for me? A toupee and clip on pony tail. She said she had noticed my hair loss over the past few months and \"you young men like pony tails\". It was obviously a joke set she had bought (although she didn't realise this) and I wasn't actually balding, I had my hair cut into a grade 2 by choice!!! Graham Kelsall When I was 10 my gran knitted the most horrendous, unfashionable purple cardigan in acrylic wool with huge purple buttons she said I would grow. My gran has been dead for 3 years now, i am now 42 years old and a size 16 - it's still too big! Kathy Keegans Not a present as such but I've not been happy about everyone having great slap-up dinners at Christmas while I'm fasting for Ramadam. Nadeem Faruque Last year I received a Playstation console and played it all Christmas right up until the new year. Well because I liked the puzzle games last year so much, this year I was given a cobination padlock with no combination to amuse myself with. Michael Williams It was this Christmas I recieved what I call a christmas turkey of a present. I am a bit of a gadget freak and every year I usually recieve a gadget or something which is usually realy usefull,of my wife. So this year she gave me this gift wrapped box, I opened it with excitement and inside was a picnic hamper, just what I have always wanted, never mind there is lways next year. P A Hunt I was having a relaxing time over Christmas with family having just broken my leg skiing. I am a keen runner and had always wanted a particular pair of running shoes but never been able to afford them. So, what do my brothers do - yep, they club together to buy them for me for Christmas, so now all I can do is look at them until my leg heals. Caroline Sayers My auntie Madge, an eccentric but practical private mobile nurse, came back from holiday in Cornwall with my Christmas present on Christmas eve. Because she had to be on duty the next day she rushed round to exchange gifts that night. She apologised for being in a rush and for not wrapping mine up and handed me one of her infamous brown paper bags. On Christmas Day while she was on duty I telephoned her to thank her for the present, although amused at the unusual practical nature of her gift on this occasion. She burst in to laughter and informed me that Mr Tomlins whom she had visited earlier was really happy with the jars of preserves from Cornwall. I as not to dissapoint the old man Mr Tomlins had to be content, this year, with his specimen bottles. Naomi Towers A few Christmases ago for some reason known only to her self, my wife's auntie alice sent us a magazine picture of the children's TV character barney the dinosaur as a genuine xmas present. I still haven't figured out why. Stevie Curry Last Christmas my miserable grandmother gave me an ashtray (I don't smoke). Not such a bad present one might think, but it was the same one I gave to her three years earlier. (It wasn't even washed properly!) Mark Hollingsworth I got an electric toothbrush from my dad, but that's proved useful! It pales compared to the massager \"device\" I also got form him.It looks like a computer mouse, and buzzes when pressed.But it doesn't massage anywhere in any useful way, because it's got a really weak pulse! The best use I've found is for entertaining my baby sister in law, who loved it and wouldn't let it go. Derrick Smith I believe my Christmas gift from my dearest hubby must be the worst one ever! The jobs around the home had been building up and I kept complaining they never got done, and I remarked I would do the jobs myself if the power tools weren't so heavy and akward to use. His answer was he just didn't have the time and what little time he had he wanted to relax not turn into Handy-Andy! Christmas morning I awoke to a big box wrapped in lovely paper with a nice big bow, I was quite surprised and excited, that was until I got the paper off then my face was one of shock, yep my wonderful Christmas pressie was a Black and Decker Quattro. I wasn't sure if it was a joke at first and waited for him to give me my real gift but I realised it was no joke when he said \"I saw this and thought of you, now you will be able to do the jobs yourself\" Hmm..... I wonder what I'm getting for my birthday (the complete DIY book??) Dawn Sanders This year my grandparents gave me 10 thermostatic valves for the radiators in my house!! Claire Dennis The worst (and cheapest) present I ever had for Christmas was a bag of bright-green, scented rocks. The label read 'alternative to potpourri; suitable for smokers'. I don't smoke (and never have). The person who bought them must hate me a lot. Tony Nixon This is going back about 10 years - I was about 15 (I'm not sure if that's cheating). I had a favourite aunt who always bought me very interesting Christmas presents. One year she bought me a lemon and a packet of sticking plasters. Nicely wrapped and everything. I'm not sure why she did it - I think she had had a rough year. Anyway, it didn't affect my opinion of her... I can't even remember thinking it strange until a few years later. Suzi Wells Please don't publish my name on this one. This year I got sent a wedding photo in a frame from a couple I'm friends with. I was unable to get to the wedding, so she thought this might make up for it in some way. The only problem is that I'm still totally in love with the man in question, it breaks my heart to look at the picture and I'm going to have to put it up somewhere so as not to offend them. Anonymous My wife received a hair dryer as a Christmas present, from my mother, unfortunately. \"Not too bad,\" you may think, but it is identical to one she already has at home. Without offending my mother by asking her for the receipt, we decided to take the hair dryer back to Boots. The customer services woman was very helpful and said that it was no problem, she just had to scan the barcode to find the original price and give us vouchers to the same value. Imagine how embarrassed I was when she informed us that the hair dryer had been a free gift given with other goods bought earlier in the year.

Luge Pravda My worst Christmas present ever: A years membership to 'slimmers world' from my (ex!)Boyfriend. Bernadette Hancock Worst Christmas present actually arrived this year. A Playstation 2. \"Turkey?\" I hear you cry? My mother had pre-ordered it and collected it on release day in November (bless her), and then to keep it top secret she hid the PS2 in the loft. Where it suffered the variations in temperature that a lot of lofts are exposed to in Winter. So on Christmas Day when it was opened, firstly I was stunned that my mum would think of such a wonderful present for me, then stunned again whilst taking it out of its box and finding water trickling out of it. Now I can't get a replacement until March. Being a gaming addict, this is sheer torture. Michael Scoates This year I received a vase which had been dropped, broken and super glued back together. This in itself would have warranted an entry at maybe number 8 on my all-time top 10 list of corking presents. What catapulted it to the top of the tree, however, was the fact that several vital pieces of pottery had obviously gone astray and the search had been called off due to a lack of resources. Andy I seem to do very well or should I say badly out of naff Christmas presents. One was a very disgusting tortoise boot scraper and a man-made fibre jumper with very tasteful bunches of cherries on. Probably very popular in Eastern European states about 10 years ago. Matthew Pearl On the night before Christmas Eve I was driving home with some friends when a black cat darted out in front of the car and didn't quite make it. I stopped the car and got out to take a look but there was nothing I could do for it. I placed the cat on the side of the road and went on my way, all the while thinking about the poor feline and the people who would miss it. I woke up on Christmas morning, having nearly forgotten about the cat accident and went to open my presents with my family. After the usual presents of socks and toilet joke books I got to a shoebox size present. To my surprise (and horror) I found a pair of those oversize fun slippers in the style of two black cats. I was made to wear them but they soon became 'lost' on Boxing Day. Philip Sharp I was 20 years old and had just started seeing this lad, we had been going out for about three months. Christmas day came and much to my amazement, he had bought me an encyclopaedia and a pair of pink suede, fur lined slippers! For Christmas, he received the ELBOW!! Kathryn Cox On receiving a beautifully wrapped present from my husbands' grandmother I was well impressed. It was a lot larger and heavier than the usual gifts she had given me. So I duly put it under the festive tree and resolved that however much I wanted to peek I would resist the urge. Christmas morning (after the kids had opened their pressies) it was my turn! Usual gifts from Granny-in-law were bath salts (genuine victorian!) and a bale of tea towels..But that year she surpassed herself. I pick up the parcel only to discover that the wrapping and the carpet underneath were soaking wet and smelt dubious. I could not believe it when I open it to find a whole cooked chicken that was once frozen! I later found out that Gran had cooked the chicken for us and frozen it thinking that it would come in useful over Christmas. Still it's the thought that counts...not! This years present went straight in the freezer even though it turned out to be a cordless phone! Karen For some people my Christmas presents this year would represent a slice of heaven. I received a total of 600 cigarettes (duty free of course) from my friends and family. Nothing else. Unfortunately I had foolishly given up, two weeks previously. As I was amused/shocked that so many people had the same idea but I had no other choice but to give them all away. Nalu This year I was given a jazz CD, some coffee beans, and various other sundries from my Mom-in-law. Nice stuff, according to my wife, who had all these things on her list of desired gifts! K Belluz My worst Christmas pressie that I can remember is getting the sound of Bread LP and when I opened it to play it on Christmas Day the wrong album was inside. It was Donny and Marie Osmond. Angela Williams I am used to my mother giving me a pair of marigolds every year, but this year I really feel my whole family feel I have something lacking in my life. My sister sent me a second hand butter dish complete with receipt and my mother gave me a pack of dish cloths and a pack of floor cloths. She didn't even include the marigolds this year! Vanessa My Grandmother is 92 years old. She looks like Margaret Rutherford and for the last 10 years has obviously decided to play up to her eccentric image by bestowing on her grandchildren some very odd gifts. Last year, I got a Haze air freshener. Very useful, except that I'm allergic to perfume. The year before, she gave me a model horse with only three legs. When I complained, she replied, 'What's the problem? It still looks like a horse, doesn't it?' This year, she promised me something nice. I got a golfing umbrella. Definitely an improvement, you might think...except it's the one she grabbed off me in June when I wheel-chaired her in the rain to a relative's funeral... Lesley Wilkinson 500 personalised address labels was probably the worst Christmas present I ever received.The phone number was wrong! Sue Nicholson Going back a few years, my Grandmother (bless her), knowing I was a fanatical Newcastle United fan bought me the latest football shirt. She packaged the shirt for posting and sent it to me. A couple of days later and my postman arrived in pouring rain with my present. Unfortunately, my loving Grandmother had wrapped the shirt in red paper and the rain had made the red dye run onto the sacred black and white top. The result, a football shirt in the colours of Sunderland. Thanks Gran! Craig Anderson It is a mistake for my mother to buy me presents: she lives exactly 423 miles away from me, and is 40 years my senior; we communicate, by phone, tersely, once a month. This year a parcel from her arrived which contained for a technophile like me the dubious gift of an Arthurian-themed address book, in which each letter of the alphabet was decorated with portraits and legends of the various knights of the round table, each page with William Morris bordering and panels. Preferring my WAP phone and laptop, this was not a good choice for me, so I forwarded it, re-wrapped, to a distant friend, who had once expressed modest enthusiasm for attending the Glastonbury Festival. At New Year my mother rang and asked if I liked my present and as I pondered various easy lies she interrupted me saying: \"I hope you noticed that I wrote my address in there - perhaps I'll get some letters from you this year!\" Paul McClure My worst Christmas present ever was a set of wind chimes - but I have had the last laugh, I put them up outside the house on Boxing Day and boy are they driving everyone mad!! Paul Sharman When I was about 13 years old I received the following from my mum for Christmas: school uniform, a satchel, and a geometry set. As you can guess I was disappointed. Kathy Spendel A couple of years ago I fell in love with those tiny Ixus cameras - so compact, so stylish, so covetable! As my old camera was on its last legs, the ideal solution was at hand: convey to my ever-loving partner that this was to be my next Christmas present. Accordingly I seized every possible opportunity to point the camera's desirability out to him; drawing attention to newspaper adverts and stopping meaningfully in front of camera-shop windows, where I would rhapsodize about the perfection of the design and the fact that I longed to possess one. My big error was this: I didn't actually say BUY ME AN IXUS CAMERA. Come Christmas morning, he produced (with a flourish) an enormous parcel that must have measured about 4 feet by 1 foot. On unwrapping it I discovered a keyboard - yes, a keyboard - which I could plug into my computer and play as a digital piano. Apparently I had once, in the dim and distant past (so distant I couldn't even remember it) said something about wishing I'd learnt the piano as a child. Penny Gore I bought my boyfriend an all-singing all-dancing top of the range DVD player and received a box of Milk Tray in return... Demir Sayiner Come into my house and a singing plastic fish hanging in my hallway will greet you. If you get past that, watch out for the singing, dancing lobster that is sitting in front of the door reciting Otis Redding. In the main room, you'll discover a talking donkey that moans about the weather, perched next to a farting teddy bear that apologises profusely following its outbursts. All this is because I mentioned to a couple of people that I sometimes get lonely as a student. A new DVD or palm top would have eased the pain. Still, there's the birthday to come. Jason Wood My worst ever gift was a petrol cap for my husband's car! It may have been my fault as I was always complaining that I couldn't undo the one on the car but insult was added to injury as this one came wrapped in the carrier bag from the motorists shop. Anonymous On Boxing Day we all go to my dear nana's and every year we never know what she's going to get us. She came into the living room as she always does dragging two white santa sacks, smiled and said \"santa's been!\" with the same silly grin. Me and my sister slowly turned our heads and laughed. We began opening out presents with my nana and granda looking on. After I had opened the usual bath bubbles and plastic beaded necklace, I came across a very small parcel in my treasures. \"It feel's like.....\" I said slowly peeling the paper \"IT'S A PLUG!\" I cried out laughing. \"AN ELECTRIC PLUG!\" Everyone else looked on in disbelief before joining in with the laughter. Nana just tapped her nose and said \"you won't be laughing in a minute\". I continued opening, afraid of what I would come across next. After a purse and a box of chocolates I saw nana's face light up when I pulled an oblong shaped parcel out of the bag. I took off the paper to reveal a battery recharger. Sure enough the thing didn't have a plug on the end. Again the room erupted in hysterics. I don't know which was the worst gift, the plug or the recharger.But it has come in useful for recharging my son's Christmas toys, considering I had to buy nearly 30 batteries I suppose it wasn't that useless after all......poor Nana! Madeline Gibson My worst Christmas present ever has got to be a Shawaddywaddy single. Ged Carroll A 'hanging basket' kit - everything you would want to produce flowers in hanging baskets, including a guide book and special basket to get you started. For a 31 year old bloke with no interest in gardening, this was a prize turkey. Adam Brooks Read more entries",

      "bodyText": "The departure of Tony Hall from BBC News marks the end of an era for the corporation's news coverage. A classic example of a BBC \"lifer\", he was as fond of management theory and attention to administrative processes as his former boss Sir John Birt. After entering the BBC through the traditional route as a news trainee, Mr Hall progressed through the ranks, and was plucked from relative obscurity as a programme editor to become editor of news and current affairs in 1987. It was widely accepted that Mr Hall, known in the BBC as \"head boy\", would leave following his failure to win over the board of governors in the battle to become director-general. And he has been tarnished by persistent talk that his aides briefed against rival candidates during the leadership campaign. Many in the BBC will welcome the opportunity for a change at the top. Mr Hall's skills as a journalist and news manager are not questioned. The BBC unquestionably still retains its reputation for journalistic excellence, and Mr Hall has handled one of BBC News's toughest PR battles, News 24, with dexterity. His career as director of BBC news has spanned two general elections, the largest conflict on European soil since the second world war, the introduction of a controversial new electronic newsgathering system and the move of the BBC institution the Nine O'Clock News. Mr Hall can also take the ultimate credit for launching Radio 5 in the face of massive opposition and for launching the hugely successful BBC Online news. His lifelong interest in economics has yielded two books, one on the miners and another on nuclear power. But some of Mr Hall's managerial judgements have come in for strong criticism, notably his role in the decision to ship BBC journalists from Broadcasting House to White City, and the introduction of the unpopular \"super-editors\", a decision that led to open mutiny among journalists. Former BBC radio boss Liz Forgan described the move to White City as a \"mad idea\", and revealed that Mr Hall and Mr Birt kept information about the move, including budgets, a secret. His successor will inherit one of the toughest jobs in British broadcasting, facing growing competition from the plethora of new news services springing up on new digital channels and the internet. The chosen candidate will also face a consolidated attack from commercial broadcasters on new licence-fee funded services. And moves begun under John Birt to make the news more \"user-friendly\" face a challenge from two directions. The BBC's news services have to combine authority with usability, but without attracting charges of dumbing-down.",

The agency hopes to raise \u00a3256m from councils in England and Wales, a rise of 13.5% on last year's budget. Increases will vary across regions, with Yorkshire expected to incur the largest.

An incident room has been set up in Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, and detectives are starting the task of contacting relatives. The dead are among the 297 patients highlighted in a government report last week, who are thought to be victims of the killer doctor. The report, a clinical audit commissioned by the department of health, discovered that Shipman issued a total of 499 death certificates while at his practice in Hyde, Greater Manchester. A comparison between Shipman and other GPs in the town showed that 297 of these were \"excess\" certificates - deaths which were statistically unlikely to occur among his patients. Of these, 236 patients died at home - the vast majority women over 65-years-old. The 62 deaths are cases not covered by the original police inquiry into Shipman, who is serving life after being convicted a year ago of murdering 15 elderly women patients by injecting them with diamorphine.

Beattie's agency, TBWA GGT Simons Palmer, has created a series of raunchy ads for Pretty Polly including a recent press campaign showing a young woman with her hand down her knickers, with the slogan, \"Go on treat yourself\". Last year the ITC allowed a TV ad based on a saucy holiday postcard to remain on air despite 43 public complaints. Neither party was available for comment on the split but it is thought that Pretty Polly wants to put its advertising on hold until it works out a new strategy. Pretty Polly hired TBWA four years ago and has since transformed itself from a tights manufacturer into a racy lingerie brand, most recently with the launch of its Almost Naked range.

The show won its 8-9pm slot with a 7.6m audience and a 32% share, but in the process lost nearly 7m of the viewers inherited from Coronation Street, according to unofficial overnights. The first episode of Popstars featured LWT entertainment head Nigel Lythgoe and other showbiz gurus auditioning young hopefuls for the pop band they are putting together. It comfortably beat BBC1 opposition Celebrity Ready Steady Cook, which took 5.5m, and docu-soap Escape to the Sun, with 4.9m. But nearly 7m Coronation Street viewers switched off when with Popstars came on. The big turn-off is traditional following the soap, which got 14.3m viewers. Last Wednesday in the same slot, A Touch of Frost repeat averaged 9.1m and a 37% share, following on from a 15.5m Coronation Street audience. The show is set to make a screen star of Mr Lythgoe, king of showbiz at LWT, who is one a panel of judges alongside a former Take That publicist and a Polydor A&amp;R boss. TV critics described the showbusiness world it exposed as \"a savage jungle\". However, ITV director of programmes David Liddiment will have been heartened that Popstars' audience grew over the hour it was on air, from 7.2m to 8.3m. Placing the first episode of Popstars after ITV ratings flagship Coronation Street was a scheduling ploy to allow as wide an audience as possible to sample the show before it moves to its regular 5.55pm Saturday night slot, where the key target demographic will be 16 to 34-year-olds. Last night the opener had a 42% share among 16 to 34s. This compares favourably with ITV's most popular show among this age group, Cold Feet, which had a 47% share of 16 to 34s for its third series last autumn.",

Ed Bradley, chairman of the Alder Hey parents' support group, said more than 140 parents and relatives had travelled to London for the seminar and were glad of the opportunity to give evidence, \"however, we do question how much benefit can be gained from a one-day conference where we have only been given five minutes to represent our views.\" They also felt it would be more appropriate to discuss the way forward after the Alder Hey inquiry had reported. Alder Hey hospital is generally considered a special case, because whole organ systems were found to have been collected by a consultant pathologist, Dick Van Velzen, who is facing disciplinary hearings at the General Medical Council. Bristol parents at the seminar will be asking for Prof Kennedy's recommendations to be implemented and questioning why there has been no action since his report was published. \"It was quite clear the law was in a mess,\" said Steve Parker, chairman of the Bristol Heart Children's Action Group.",

Bottoms, the first instalment of Channel 4's Embarrassing Illnesses series, was billed in the Radio Times as a look \"at the problems often obscured by the shame surrounding piles and anal fistulas\". It drew 2.1m and a 9% share from 8.30-9pm, according to unofficial overnights. On Tuesday night Perfect Breasts, which looked at the growing trend for British teenagers to have breast implants, had 3.4m and a 19% share. Later on last night, raunchy US comedy Sex and the City returned to Channel 4 for a new run with a double bill from 10-11.15pm. The show, about the lives and loves of four thirtysomething New York women, drew 2.1m and a 12% share. Major BBC2 drama In a Land of Plenty opened last night, with a steady 2.2m and 9% share from 9pm. The epic sweep of the TalkBack Productions show, which follows the fortunes of the Freeman family over 40 years from the early 1950s, will unfold over 10 episodes. Other BBC2 shows debuting last night included Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen makeover vehicle Fantasy Rooms.

Once you get a PC that you can switch on quickly it will complement TV. They'll have different types of content delivered in different ways. If the instructions are long and boring then blokes will be playing with it and if it's really simple to use then women will. Any favourite websites? It's a bit boring but I like Amazon because I'm an avid e-consumer and there are so few decent sites. Google is brilliant for finding specific information. Yahoo uses Google now and it seems to have the users' interest in mind. I use Jakob Nielsen's Alert Box a lot for usability issues. For further information visit: www.icshowbiz.com",

      "body": "<p>Bill Gates's office, housed in number 8 of the 45 buildings on Microsoft's campus, has few personal flourishes. At any other Fortune 500 company, it might house someone of the rank of, say, vice president for community relations. </p> <p>The desk is a slab of plain oak, and the only pictures on a wall are two framed covers from the Economist given to him by his sister Libby: they show a diagram of an Intel chip and a chart describing the bandwidth of various radio frequencies. </p> <p>His PC is a Toshiba laptop with a docking station and two oversized monitors (one screen is separated into four quadrants, which stream information from selected websites all day). </p> <p>A nubby grey upholstered couch rests on a beige industrial carpet in front of a square maple coffee table surrounded by four chrome-based, green and blue wool-covered Breuer-style chairs. </p> <p>The only ostensible personal touches are several family pictures on a credenza behind his desk and a single picture of a doe-faced Gates beside Paul Allen, encircled by the handful of employees who helped launch Microsoft. This familiar picture, with its innocent faces, speaks to a basic Microsoft contradiction. On the one hand, it captures the youthful zeal, the idealism of people who embraced software as a tool to change the world, to do incredibly cool things. Less apparent in those unlined faces is the competitive zeal that helped trigger a government lawsuit. </p> <p>On this day in the middle of the anti-trust lawsuit, Gates wore a handsome, royal blue open-necked dress shirt buttoned at the sleeves and embroidered with WHG, navy slacks, unpolished black loafers, and clear-framed oval glasses. His skin was the colour of an eggshell, a pallor born of having spent too many hours indoors. </p> <p>The previous afternoon, Melinda Gates had given birth to their second child, a son, and Gates had spent part of the day at the hospital. On the day I saw him, Microsoft would announce the birth; yet even though I was not a stranger, Gates uttered not a word about this happy event. </p> <p>With Gates, impersonal behaviour is the norm. Visitors are often amazed that he fetches a soda for himself and neglects to offer one to them. Upon greeting me, Gates plopped on to one of the chairs, leaned forward and folded his arms across his thighs, and began rocking rapidly back and forth, slapping the carpet with the soles of his loafers, creating the impression that his body was a metronome. </p> <p>As Gates rocked back and forth in his chair during my visit, he was as agitated at what he thought of as the ludicrousness of the government's case as he had been a year before. \"There is no monopoly,\" he told me. \"Even with all the great people we have we face probably more intense competition now than ever before.\" </p> <p>Did he sometimes feel, as a friend had said, like Joseph K, accused of crimes he did not comprehend? \"I don't know Joseph K, sorry.\" On being told that Joseph K was the main character and victim in Franz Kafka's The Trial, Gates said, \"He sounds like my kind of guy!\" </p> <p>The Justice Department believed Microsoft was a monopoly whose intent was to hurt Netscape. They believed Gates and his employees often behaved like thugs. Now, a year after he had failed to reach an out-of-court settlement that could have avoided this trial, did Gates regret having gone to court? </p> <p>\"I wish we could have settled. I wished that at the time. I wish that now.\" The stumbling block, he said, was that he couldn't go back to the government for permission each time he wanted to add a new feature, just because a competitor like Netscape whined about it. What about coercion, I asked - the charge that Microsoft muscled Intel to stay out of the software business? \"I don't know what muscle means,\" he said. </p> <p>What if his daughter came to him some years hence and asked, \"Dad, how do you explain some of these e-mails and things like the threat to cut off Netscape's air supply?\" </p> <p>Gates was composed, but he answered in a shrill voice. \"A great lie! A great lie!\" he cried out. \"An unbelievable lie!\" It was secondhand hearsay, he said. His voice rising, yet controlled, he went on, \"Did anyone utter those words? Our e-mail, every piece of it has been searched. I wish we had found somebody who had said it. Then we could take him out, and we could hang the guy, then we'd say, 'OK, mea culpa. We found him - the guy who said I'll cut off your oxygen'.\" </p> <p>\"First of all, there's no law against saying that. Second of all, I never heard anybody say it. Third of all - hey, if there's any company that you know damn well whether it was said or not, this is the company. Every piece of e-mail I have ever sent for the last 10 years has been read and read, and if there is any way that people can misconstrue any statement that I've ever made it has been done. You look at any e-mail sent by me or received by me and tell me what it is you think is at all inappropriate?\" </p> <p>Microsoft executives don't see themselves the way they are portrayed in a courtroom 3,000 miles away. By contrast, to a monopolist who has the luxury of sitting back and behaving in a leisurely fashion, Microsoft executives feel embattled. </p> <p>Dr James Allchin, who supervised Windows, said: \"I feel like we're on the brink of disaster every day. If you're reading newspapers and watching what's happening - new devices, new operating systems, attacks that claim intellectual property means nothing - it's like a massive attack all the time.\" </p> <p><strong> External threats</strong><br> </p> <p> He worried about an attack from Sony and its \"fixed game machines, because they're growing up\", about cable boxes that could control all home electronics, about handheld personal digital assistants that can perform multiple tasks, about open-source software, about the \"megaserver threat\" posed by an AOL online operating system where \"once you're in an AOL environment, you're in it holistically\", about how the distinction between hardware and software companies blurs as Intel and Dell and IBM invest in software, and AT&amp;T is now a cable and an internet-access as well as a telephone company. </p> <p>Microsoft in 1999 spent an extraordinary $3bn on research and development. This represented about 17% of its revenues, a figure that dwarfs the 6% IBM spent, or the 10% of revenues expended by such companies as Intel and Sun. </p> <p>A sizable portion of this budget is earmarked for pure research - for recruiting and funding the best physicists and mathematicians and electrical engineers to undertake theoretical work that does not have a clear product payoff. In an era when such theoretical research is usually sacrificed as impractical and companies strive to cut costs and drive up their stock price, Microsoft is a rare oasis. </p> <p>It is also, needless to say, a place seeking to dominate the realm of new products: an electronic encyclopedia on Africa, Encarta Africa; browsers for wireless devices; web television, which brings e-mail and the web to television sets; PCs that accept voice commands and translate handwriting into type; PCs in cars that function as radios and CD players; and navigation devices that offer voice instructions. </p> <p>Rick Thompson, vice president of the hardware group, described his 225-employee division as \"my own little sandbox\". Most of their research efforts fail after they come to market. \"It's a lot like the movie business. There are a lot of flops.\" </p> <p>Doug Heinrich, who is director of business development and is working on speech and handwriting recognition, said the plan was to include at least some of these innovative features in a version of Windows 2000. </p> <p>At Microsoft, what the US government calls \"bundling\" is referred to as \"integration\", and not without reason. Integration lets programs running on Windows interact seamlessly, allowing users to switch back and forth with greater speed and ease than ever before. </p> <p> Microsoft claims such additions serve consumers. The US justice department claims they were intended to solidify Microsoft's monopoly. They probably do both. After all, Microsoft benefited consumers by reducing the price of browsers, and at the same time they undermined Netscape. </p> <p>Microsoft executives see themselves as upright, public-spirited citizens. Three quarters of all Microsoft employees made philanthropic gifts that were matched by the company, resulting in up to $30m in corporate donations to support homeless shelters, zoos, and efforts in 20 cities. Another $70m-$100m of software was donated by Microsoft to schools and libraries. </p> <p>While Gates's company has been quietly generous, Gates himself was at first reluctant to part with his money. Like his friend Warren Buffett, he said that philanthropy takes effort and time, which he didn't have. He was planning to wait until he was old and then would give most of his fortune away. </p> <p>In the last several years, Gates has dramatically altered this stance and become the world's foremost philanthropist, having by January 2000 pledged $21.8bn to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, making it the world's wealthiest charitable foundation. </p> <p>In today's currency, Rockefeller's donations would have totalled $6bn and Carnegie's $3bn. Both Buffett and Gates Senior attribute the change to Melinda, who has more time to devote to charity. \"Melinda has spurred him,\" said Buffett. </p> <p>Cynics attribute these gifts to a Gates public-relations offensive designed to offset the black eye he has received from the trial. While press considerations may have been a factor in the timing of some gifts, that's a pretty steep price to pay for publicity. </p> <p>At Microsoft, executives and programmers speak of their work with genuine reverence - they can be as pious as mullahs or priests. When Ben Waldman, who oversaw relations with Apple, is asked to describe the culture of Microsoft, he says with utter solemnity, \"People are very passionate about creating great products... We do things to help people solve problems.\" </p> <p><strong> New frontiers</strong><br> </p> <p> What is surprising is that one would be hard-pressed to find an employee who frankly admits that Microsoft is a for-profit company in the business of making money, not a beneficent foundation serving the public interest. </p> <p>Yusuf Mehdi, who directs marketing for Windows, talks of his work as if it were the frontier of medical science. \"There's the same feeling you have in college - I can do something great!\" How did he square these sentiments, I asked, with the sometimes John Gotti-like behaviour described in court? \"What I would say is that a lot of this legal stuff comes from competitors, not from end users. What the trial is is sensationalist bits and pieces. The trial was supposed to be about bundling. I'm not saying we're not aggressive. We get after it. But it's in the interest of doing what's best for customers.\" </p> <p>Such sanctimony is common at Microsoft, from Bill Gates down. \"What we aim to do is to make tools to make people's lives better,\" Gates once told a congressional hearing. There is a tendency at Microsoft to talk about consumers, not profits. No doubt, Microsoft could not recruit the best and brightest without conveying a belief that it is waging a holy war to better serve consumers, improve computing, do 'cool' things. </p> <p>But it is weird that Microsoft executives rarely speak of fat profits or rich stock options, although executives in their twenties drive BMWs and those in their thirties establish private foundations and often retire, and Microsoft hogs as profit an extraordinary forty cents of each revenue dollar it collects. Jean-Louis Gass\u00e9e, the CEO of rival software firm Be, once likened Microsoft's behaviour to that of believers in a religious order, \"The Jesuits have this concept of holy effrontery - in defending their cause it's OK to use any means.\"</p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4112240,00.html\">January 4 2001 Microsoft faces $5bn discrimination claim</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4097411,00.html\">November 28 2000 Microsoft says trial infected with error</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4027069,00.html\">June 8 2000 What once was unthinkable is now a court order'</a><br></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/freedomtoinnovate/\"> News of the lawsuit from Microsoft.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www0.mercurycenter.com/business/microsoft/trial/\"> The San Jose Mercury's trial special</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov/\"> The US Department of Justice</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk/pdf/news/microsoft/ms-conclusions.pdf\"> Judge Jackson's final decision</a><br> \u00a9 Ken Auletta 2001, from WORLD WAR 3.0: Microsoft and its Enemies by Ken Auletta, published by Profile Books Ltd at \u00a317.99 on January 15 </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,421129,00.html\">Read part two</a></p>",

At any other Fortune 500 company, it might house someone of the rank of, say, vice president for community relations. The desk is a slab of plain oak, and the only pictures on a wall are two framed covers from the Economist given to him by his sister Libby: they show a diagram of an Intel chip and a chart describing the bandwidth of various radio frequencies. His PC is a Toshiba laptop with a docking station and two oversized monitors (one screen is separated into four quadrants, which stream information from selected websites all day).

      "body": "<p>The ad runs something like this: \"Good promotion prospects for a well-organised person with experience of dealing with customers face to face.\"</p> <p>If you saw such an advertisement, you'd probably run a mile, picturing yourself frying burgers on the minimum wage until you finally flip and quit. But if the job in question is at the frontline of housing management, the words may be a surprisingly reliable guide to what lies in store. Certainly, people skills are at a premium. </p> <p>A housing officer (or housing assistant, tenant services or community housing officer - or whatever other title the job may have) will be expected to interview prospective tenants, chase up rent arrears, intervene to resolve disputes between neighbours. </p> <p>All too often people's contact with the housing office may be at a point of crisis, for example when their home is flooded, they are experiencing domestic violence or they are about to be evicted. It is life in the raw. </p> <p>To survive as a housing officer, a strong personality and a good sense of humour will count for a lot more than paper qualifications. And though qualifications are becoming more important, the housing profession has tried to ensure that those who start on the frontline have the chance of promotion. </p> <p>The most common route to qualification is a part-time degree or diploma on a day release basis. Often people start courses in their late 20s and 30s. There are also BTEC and HNC courses for those with a less academic background. According to Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) head of education Roger Keller: \"People come into housing from a wide range of backgrounds. We are trying to find the right pathways so that no one is debarred from getting qualifications.\" </p> <p>At least as challenging is making sure that courses remain appropriate for a rapidly evolving profession. National Housing Federation (NHF) head of housing management and support Kathleen Boyle says housing management has changed out of all recognition. Where it was once a mainstream tenure for people in work, people living in social housing are more likely to be poor and have other problems.

      "bodyText": "The ad runs something like this: \"Good promotion prospects for a well-organised person with experience of dealing with customers face to face.\" If you saw such an advertisement, you'd probably run a mile, picturing yourself frying burgers on the minimum wage until you finally flip and quit. But if the job in question is at the frontline of housing management, the words may be a surprisingly reliable guide to what lies in store. Certainly, people skills are at a premium. A housing officer (or housing assistant, tenant services or community housing officer - or whatever other title the job may have) will be expected to interview prospective tenants, chase up rent arrears, intervene to resolve disputes between neighbours. All too often people's contact with the housing office may be at a point of crisis, for example when their home is flooded, they are experiencing domestic violence or they are about to be evicted. It is life in the raw. To survive as a housing officer, a strong personality and a good sense of humour will count for a lot more than paper qualifications. And though qualifications are becoming more important, the housing profession has tried to ensure that those who start on the frontline have the chance of promotion. The most common route to qualification is a part-time degree or diploma on a day release basis. Often people start courses in their late 20s and 30s. There are also BTEC and HNC courses for those with a less academic background. According to Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) head of education Roger Keller: \"People come into housing from a wide range of backgrounds. We are trying to find the right pathways so that no one is debarred from getting qualifications.\" At least as challenging is making sure that courses remain appropriate for a rapidly evolving profession. National Housing Federation (NHF) head of housing management and support Kathleen Boyle says housing management has changed out of all recognition. Where it was once a mainstream tenure for people in work, people living in social housing are more likely to be poor and have other problems. The NHF also runs short courses and training programmes. \"Social landlords have to see housing management as about making a neighbourhood a viable place for people to live,\" Ms Boyle says. In organisations that have embraced this social inclusion agenda, housing officers may be expected to become like community workers, combining with residents to develop child care facilities or job training, or setting up partnerships with the police or youth service to cut crime or provide activities outside school hours. If that doesn't appeal, there are plenty of other jobs to move to, particularly as the CIH professional qualification of the future will be all about providing people with interchangeable skills. Developing new homes, providing housing for people with special needs, helping homeowners improve their homes, working in housing policy or even taking up an academic career - take your pick. Perhaps it is time to put that burger bar experience to good use.

      "body": "<p>This week saw three very different countries struggling to come to terms with their past. In each case, the debate is taking place against a recent historical backdrop of bloodshed, deep political divisions, and social turmoil.</p> <p>But although the context may be similar, these national inquests show there are many, varied paths to truth and reconciliation. - and none of them is easy.</p> <p>In Chile, the process was in one sense thrust upon the country by events beyond its control. The key event was a Spanish judge's issuance of an arrest order for the country's former military dictator, General Augusto Pinochet.</p> <p>That unexpected initiative led, famously, to Pinochet's arrest in London during a private visit and to subsequent extradition proceedings that ended last year with his return to Chile on medical grounds.</p> <p>The controversy surrounding Pinochet's detention in Britain brought to the surface a long-suppressed debate in Chile about terrible legacy of the years of military-led rule from 1973 to 1990.</p> <p>Contrary to the expectations of many, relatives of thousands of Pinochet opponents who disappeared without trace were emboldened to press their case for a full accounting. They found support from an investigating magistrate, Judge Juan Guzman.</p> <p>Far from being the end of the matter, Pinochet's release by Britain proved to be only the start of Chile's hunt for the truth. A can of worms had been opened and now refused to be shut.</p> <p>Amid continuing attempts by Pinochet to take refuge behind amnesty laws enacted by his own regime, Chile's recently-elected socialist president, Ricardo Lagos, went on national television last Sunday and weighed in to the debate.</p> <p>What he had to say was explosive. Lagos gave blood-curdling details of the fate of 180 detainees missing from the Pinochet years, including the dumping of bodies from helicopters into the Pacific. He revealed the existence of a mass grave in Santiago. He said he was asking the supreme court to investigate the new information with despatch.</p> <p>Lagos's action has effectively ensured that not only will inquiries into past atrocities not be buried in legal argument - but that they will expand in scope and detail. Even if 85-year-old Pinochet, who claims to be ill, does not live to see it, it now seems more likely than ever that Chile will eventually confront the truth about itself.</p> <p>Serbia provides a quite different story. Nearly a month after the democratic opposition confirmed its ascendancy in parliamentary elections following last autumn's overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic, there is still no consensus about what to do about Milosevic and other individuals indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague.</p> <p>Although Biljana Plavsic, a former aide to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, flew voluntarily to the Hague this week, there have been no arrests of war criminals wanted in connection with Serbia's wars in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo for more than six months.</p> <p>Vojislav Kostunica, the new Yugoslav president, is on record as saying that Serbia must examine its past and punish the guilty. But when it comes to arresting and handing over Milosevic and other top suspects like Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb general, he havers and stalls. No m echanisms have yet been created in Serbia itself for examining more broadly what happened during the Milosevic years.</p> <p>There is as yet no South African-style truth and reconciliation commission, no investigating magistrate like Judge Guzman. Many Serbs, duped by Milosevic's propaganda machine and misled by state-controlled television and radio, still have no idea of the extent of the crimes committed in their name during more than a decade of strife.</p> <p>And tentative discussions about setting up a Hague subsidiary tribunal inside Serbia to try Milosevic have so far come to nothing.</p> <p>Unlike Chile, where the threat of \"communism\" (the pretext for Pinochet's coup) has long since receded, Serbs apparently still feel threatened by hostile forces. In their case, it is the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo and southern Serbia and to a lesser extent, secessionists in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.</p> <p>For these reasons among others, Serbia's ability to move forward to a better future looks like being hampered for some time to come by its limited willingness to open its eyes to the past.</p> <p>China, on the other hand, or at least China's rulers, present a picture of total denial when it comes to certain events in their recent history. This was amply illustrated this week by Beijing's angry rejection of documents published in the US purporting to shed light on the massacre in Tiananmen Square in June 1989.</p> <p>The \"Tiananmen papers\" detailed for the first time disputes within the Communist leadership over how best to deal with the pro-democracy student movement. It is still not known to this day how many people died in the square when party hardliners prevailed and the tanks went in. But the toll was undoubtedly in the hundreds.</p> <p>Discussion of these events, and the subsequent suppression of political dissent, is banned in China. The official view is almost that it did not happen at all.

      "bodyText": "This week saw three very different countries struggling to come to terms with their past. In each case, the debate is taking place against a recent historical backdrop of bloodshed, deep political divisions, and social turmoil. But although the context may be similar, these national inquests show there are many, varied paths to truth and reconciliation. - and none of them is easy. In Chile, the process was in one sense thrust upon the country by events beyond its control. The key event was a Spanish judge's issuance of an arrest order for the country's former military dictator, General Augusto Pinochet. That unexpected initiative led, famously, to Pinochet's arrest in London during a private visit and to subsequent extradition proceedings that ended last year with his return to Chile on medical grounds. The controversy surrounding Pinochet's detention in Britain brought to the surface a long-suppressed debate in Chile about terrible legacy of the years of military-led rule from 1973 to 1990. Contrary to the expectations of many, relatives of thousands of Pinochet opponents who disappeared without trace were emboldened to press their case for a full accounting. They found support from an investigating magistrate, Judge Juan Guzman. Far from being the end of the matter, Pinochet's release by Britain proved to be only the start of Chile's hunt for the truth. A can of worms had been opened and now refused to be shut. Amid continuing attempts by Pinochet to take refuge behind amnesty laws enacted by his own regime, Chile's recently-elected socialist president, Ricardo Lagos, went on national television last Sunday and weighed in to the debate. What he had to say was explosive. Lagos gave blood-curdling details of the fate of 180 detainees missing from the Pinochet years, including the dumping of bodies from helicopters into the Pacific. He revealed the existence of a mass grave in Santiago. He said he was asking the supreme court to investigate the new information with despatch. Lagos's action has effectively ensured that not only will inquiries into past atrocities not be buried in legal argument - but that they will expand in scope and detail. Even if 85-year-old Pinochet, who claims to be ill, does not live to see it, it now seems more likely than ever that Chile will eventually confront the truth about itself. Serbia provides a quite different story. Nearly a month after the democratic opposition confirmed its ascendancy in parliamentary elections following last autumn's overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic, there is still no consensus about what to do about Milosevic and other individuals indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in the Hague. Although Biljana Plavsic, a former aide to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, flew voluntarily to the Hague this week, there have been no arrests of war criminals wanted in connection with Serbia's wars in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo for more than six months. Vojislav Kostunica, the new Yugoslav president, is on record as saying that Serbia must examine its past and punish the guilty. But when it comes to arresting and handing over Milosevic and other top suspects like Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb general, he havers and stalls. No m echanisms have yet been created in Serbia itself for examining more broadly what happened during the Milosevic years. There is as yet no South African-style truth and reconciliation commission, no investigating magistrate like Judge Guzman. Many Serbs, duped by Milosevic's propaganda machine and misled by state-controlled television and radio, still have no idea of the extent of the crimes committed in their name during more than a decade of strife. And tentative discussions about setting up a Hague subsidiary tribunal inside Serbia to try Milosevic have so far come to nothing. Unlike Chile, where the threat of \"communism\" (the pretext for Pinochet's coup) has long since receded, Serbs apparently still feel threatened by hostile forces. In their case, it is the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo and southern Serbia and to a lesser extent, secessionists in the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro. For these reasons among others, Serbia's ability to move forward to a better future looks like being hampered for some time to come by its limited willingness to open its eyes to the past. China, on the other hand, or at least China's rulers, present a picture of total denial when it comes to certain events in their recent history. This was amply illustrated this week by Beijing's angry rejection of documents published in the US purporting to shed light on the massacre in Tiananmen Square in June 1989. The \"Tiananmen papers\" detailed for the first time disputes within the Communist leadership over how best to deal with the pro-democracy student movement. It is still not known to this day how many people died in the square when party hardliners prevailed and the tanks went in. But the toll was undoubtedly in the hundreds. Discussion of these events, and the subsequent suppression of political dissent, is banned in China. The official view is almost that it did not happen at all. Hence the foreign ministry's furious denunciation of the Tiananmen papers as fakes put about by China's enemies. For a moment, after the papers' publication, it had seemed that China might finally be ready to talk about this national trauma. Then the lid slammed shut again. Who knows when the accounting will finally take place? But one thing is certain: it will one day. Ask the people of Chile.

Mrs Plavsic was one of the key political players orchestrating the orgy of ethnic pogroms in Bosnia. But there are bigger Balkan names waiting to be extradited to a cell on the North Sea. This year will be crucial in deciding whether Carla Del Ponte of Switzerland, the chief prosecutor in the Hague, can net the big fish. The politics of war crimes in the Balkans are acute and getting trickier by the week. Things were black-and-white when Serbia and Croatia were ruled by the brutish megalomaniacs, Slobodan Milosevic and Franjo Tudjman. But the democratic revival in Croatia a year ago following Tudjman's death and Serbia's October revolution overthrowing a decade of despotism under Milosevic turn things various shades of grey. The war crimes issue is so delicate that it could trigger the collapse of the Croatian government of the prime minister, Ivica Racan, and jeopardise the stability of the new Serbian administration under Zoran Dzindzic and Vojislav Kostunica. In Belgrade, the big issue is the biggest of them all - the fate of Milosevic, already indicted by the Hague for war crimes against Kosovo but also being investigated for licensing and sponsoring the Bosnian bloodbath. In Zagreb, the trickiest problem is the earlier Croatian war of independence, with senior military figures being investigated for alleged crimes against Serbs within Croatia during the whirlwind offensives that won Croatia its war against Belgrade in the summer of 1995. Del Ponte is poised to go on the offensive. She goes to Zagreb on Monday for difficult negotiations with the Croatian leaership. She wants to see the Croatian army chief of staff, Petar Stipetic, in the Hague in connection with Operation Storm, the Croatian blitzkrieg of August 1995 which essentially ended the war against Belgrade and the Yugoslav army. After four years of partitioning Croatia and occupying a quarter of its territory, the Serb rebels were forced to beat a hasty retreat and 150,000 Serb civilians were forced to flee in a mass exodus from lands they had settled for hundreds of years. That atrocities occurred is not in doubt. But Operation Storm is a source of Croatian national pride and a rallying point for the bitter nationalists who see the popular post-Tudjman President Stipe Mesic as a traitor and are bent on making maximum trouble for the Racan government. Under Mesic and Racan, Croatia has undergone a sea-change, has been co-operating fully with the Hague, investigating its own citizens for crimes against Serbs, and Mesic even went to the Hague to provide secret testimony. But the democrat Mesic also appointed Stipetic his army chief of staff last year and the government is deeply uncomfortable with the notion that its officers could face charges when no Serbs have been arrested or prosecuted for the atrocities perpetrated in the main 1991 phase of the Serb-Croat war, notably at the destroyed Danube town of Vukovar in November 1991. Three Serb officers have been indicted for the mass murder of scores of patients taken from Vukovar hospital that November and buried in a farmyard mass grave. But they remain at large in Serbia. First things first, says Zagreb. the Hague should concentrate on \"the chronology and gravity\" of the war crimes.

The additional money will help higher education institutions to work effectively within their communities and increase the numbers of higher education students doing voluntary work.\" The three year scheme, funded jointly by the Treasury and the Department for Education and Employment, will be allocated through the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Grants for voluntary and community work will form a part of the 'third mission' for universities - to work with industry and the wider community, alongside their teaching and research activities. The funding council will consult academic institutions on applying for and utilising the funds.",

      "body": "<p>On April 21 1999, I telephoned the Ministry of Defence and asked its press office whether Nato was using weapons tipped with depleted uranium in Kosovo. \"Certainly not,\" I was told. I phoned Nato on the same day, and was told that these weapons were in fact being deployed. Yesterday the MoD's press officer confirmed to me that his department knew DU was being used at the time. So had the MoD lied to me? \"You shouldn't read anything into it,\" he assured me, \"it certainly wasn't intentionally misleading.\" A definitive denial was issued by mistake.</p> <p>Perhaps we should view the ministry's current position paper on the testing of Gulf war veterans for depleted uranium as another unfortunate accident. Or perhaps we simply shouldn't read anything into it. Otherwise we'd have no choice but to conclude that the mistakes it contains are a series of lies.</p> <p>The fine particles of dust released when a DU-tipped weapon hits its target, are, the MoD insists, \"rapidly diluted and dispersed into the environment by the weather\", soon becoming \"difficult to detect\". Yet samples taken over Kuwait City in 1993, two years after the end of the Gulf war, found depleted uranium particles in the air. This result appears to have been corroborated both by the preliminary findings of the UN team in Kosovo and by the results obtained in Iraq by the researcher Dr Chris Busby. He found that levels of radiation in the air over the Gulf war battlefields were 20 times higher last year than the levels in Baghdad.</p> <p>No one \"other than those in an armoured vehicle penetrated by a DU projectile\", the MoD paper insists, would be exposed to enough uranium \"to receive a radiation dose greater than 20 to 30 millisieverts\". In the most \"extreme and unlikely cases\", such as working for 30 or 40 hours inside a tank which had been hit by one of these missiles, a serviceman might receive \"a radiation dose of the order of 50 millisieverts.\" Such radiation levels should present little cause for concern, the paper argues, as the \"safe dose\" for people working in the UK is calculated at 50 millisieverts a year. Servicemen receiving this dose from \"extreme and unlikely\" exposure \"would be at a slightly increased risk of developing cancer\". For everyone else the risk would be \"negligible\".</p> <p>These conclusions, the MoD admits, are based on speculation, as \"no UK Gulf veterans have so far been specifically tested for the presence of uranium\" by the government. This is true, as far as it goes. But other Gulf veterans have been tested by independent researchers. And their findings, based not upon speculation but upon hard fact, suggest a very different level of contamination.</p> <p>Urine samples taken from veterans and measured by mass spectometry have been analysed by the medical researchers Professor Hari Sharma and Dr Rosalie Berthell. Their results suggest that the doses received by soldiers inhaling the dust are in the order not of 20 or 30 or 50 millisieverts, but of 778.</p> <p>As Malcolm Hooper, emeritus professor of medicinal chemistry at the University of Sunderland has shown, fine particles of DU entering the lungs are likely to stay in the body for between 10 and 20 years. The fact that DU is still appearing in some Gulf veterans' urine suggests he may be right. If this is the case and the samples taken so far are representative, then instead of a \"negligible\" or \"slightly increased\" risk of cancer, we could, he argues, expect between 1,500 and 10,500 of the UK's 53,000 Gulf war soldiers to develop fatal cancers as a result of their exposure to DU.</p> <p>Now no one can put her hand on her heart and say that the diseases beginning to emerge among both Iraqi civilians and ex-servicemen are the result of exposure to DU. But neither can anyone put her hand on her heart and say they are not. Yet this is precisely what the MoD has sought to do. Like certain other government departments, it has deployed not the precautionary principle, but the improvidence principle: shoot first, ask questions later.</p> <p>It's not hard to see why it should do so. Were the MoD to express any doubts about the safety of its procedures, the potential compensation claims would make the BSE disaster look cheap. DU dust is likely to have become so widespread that an effective clean-up operation in the Gulf and the Balkans would cost some trillions of pounds. The UK could also find itself firmly on the wrong side of the Geneva convention.</p> <p>So we can expect the unfortunate mistakes the MoD has made to continue for as long as possible.

      "body": "<p>Nato yesterday launched a massive damage limitation exercise it hopes will defuse growing concern that its use of armour-piercing depleted uranium-tipped shells in Kosovo may be the cause of unexplained cases of cancer among its troops.</p> <p>In a carefully orchestrated publicity campaign at the alliance's Brussels headquarters, Nato's secretary general, Lord Robertson, told reporters that \"no link of any kind\" had been discovered between the use of depleted uranium (DU) shells and leukaemia or other illnesses.</p> <p>\"I do not believe the public should have been as excited as it has been. We are confident that there is little risk from DU munitions, but we refuse to be complacent,\" he said after a meeting of the alliance's top policy making body, the North Atlantic Council.</p> <p>However he was adamant that even temporarily banning the use of such shells would be a grave mistake. \"We must base our analysis on facts and not be swayed by perceptions,\" he said. \"I would not agree to the use of the munitions if I believed there was a hazard.\"</p> <p>Italy, Germany and Greece all pushed for a moratorium on the use of DU yesterday, but opposition from Britain and the US meant that the proposal was stillborn. Norway later said it too wanted a ban.</p> <p>Nato's 19 ambassadors did agree to set up a working party to coordinate information on DU shells, a move which will go some way to assuaging Italy and other states which are pressing for a full inquiry. But the alliance will not conduct its own inquiry, preferring to leave it to organisations such as the UN, which it believes are better equipped for the job.</p> <p>It has, however, already passed on the location of 112 sites in Kosovo where DU shells were used against Serb armour, and which it suspects may be contaminated. The UN said yesterday that it would consider marking and possibly sealing off these sites, and Nato has pledged to help with a clean-up.</p> <p>Acutely aware of public anger in countries such as Italy over the perceived dangers of the shells, the alliance yesterday distributed a thick dossier of scientific reports debunking claims that DU was dangerous to health, and wheeled out two US medical experts from the Pentagon who claimed that the metal was practically harmless.</p> <p>A former BBC defence correspondent, Mark Laity, now a Nato spokesman, also did his best to dampen rising alarm, in front of the biggest turnout of journalists since the Kosovo conflict in 1999.</p> <p>Seated behind a 30mm DU-tipped shell of the kind fired by American tank-busting A-10 planes, Mr Laity criticised the media for blowing the issue out of all proportion. He said DU also had several civilian applications and was used as ballast in airliners and in the keels of many yachts.</p> <p>But the concerns refuse to fade and have been fuelled by the death of six Italian Balkan peacekeepers from cancer.</p> <p>Iraq yesterday demanded an inquiry into the use of DU shells in the 1991 Gulf war, suggesting that its cancer rates have soared in the aftermath.</p> <p><b>Interactive</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uranium/flash/0,7365,420455,00.html\">Guide to depleted uranium</a></p> <p><b>Online debate</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7dbf0\">Talk about it with the experts</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uranium/story/0,7369,420009,00.html\">10 January: War veterans to be screened for uranium</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uranium/story/0,7369,420165,00.html\">10 January: UN holds back on uranium warnings </a></p> <p><b>The issue explained</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/uranium/story/0,7369,419882,00.html\">Depleted uranium</a></p> <p>Useful links: <br> <a href=\"http://www.tv.cbc.ca/national/pgminfo/du/index.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> The Silver Bullet: CBC (Canada) coverage</a><br> <a href=\"http://cbc.ca/cgi-bin/templates/view.cgi?/news/2001/01/04/balkans010104\" target=\"_NEW\">Inquiries into 'Balkan Syndrome'</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.tv.cbc.ca/national/pgminfo/du/doc1.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> The Los Alamos memorandum</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.antenna.nl/wise/uranium/dissbk.html\" target=\"_NEW\">DU weapons use in the Balkans</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.antenna.nl/wise/uranium/img/dukosom.gif\" target=\"_NEW\"> NATO map showing where DU munitions were used</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.atk.com/conmun/descriptions/medium-cal-ammo/gau-8.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Manufacturer's sales pitch for DU shells</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.web-light.nl/VISIE/ud_main.html\" target=\"_NEW\">More DU links</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.healthboards.com/gulf-war-syndrome/847.html\" target=\"_NEW\">UK Gulf Veterans and Families Association</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.mod.uk/index.php3?page=955\" target=\"_NEW\">UK Ministry of Defence links</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/c mdfence/753/75304.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Commons Defence Committee report</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Nato yesterday launched a massive damage limitation exercise it hopes will defuse growing concern that its use of armour-piercing depleted uranium-tipped shells in Kosovo may be the cause of unexplained cases of cancer among its troops. In a carefully orchestrated publicity campaign at the alliance's Brussels headquarters, Nato's secretary general, Lord Robertson, told reporters that \"no link of any kind\" had been discovered between the use of depleted uranium (DU) shells and leukaemia or other illnesses. \"I do not believe the public should have been as excited as it has been. We are confident that there is little risk from DU munitions, but we refuse to be complacent,\" he said after a meeting of the alliance's top policy making body, the North Atlantic Council. However he was adamant that even temporarily banning the use of such shells would be a grave mistake. \"We must base our analysis on facts and not be swayed by perceptions,\" he said. \"I would not agree to the use of the munitions if I believed there was a hazard.\" Italy, Germany and Greece all pushed for a moratorium on the use of DU yesterday, but opposition from Britain and the US meant that the proposal was stillborn. Norway later said it too wanted a ban. Nato's 19 ambassadors did agree to set up a working party to coordinate information on DU shells, a move which will go some way to assuaging Italy and other states which are pressing for a full inquiry. But the alliance will not conduct its own inquiry, preferring to leave it to organisations such as the UN, which it believes are better equipped for the job. It has, however, already passed on the location of 112 sites in Kosovo where DU shells were used against Serb armour, and which it suspects may be contaminated. The UN said yesterday that it would consider marking and possibly sealing off these sites, and Nato has pledged to help with a clean-up. Acutely aware of public anger in countries such as Italy over the perceived dangers of the shells, the alliance yesterday distributed a thick dossier of scientific reports debunking claims that DU was dangerous to health, and wheeled out two US medical experts from the Pentagon who claimed that the metal was practically harmless. A former BBC defence correspondent, Mark Laity, now a Nato spokesman, also did his best to dampen rising alarm, in front of the biggest turnout of journalists since the Kosovo conflict in 1999. Seated behind a 30mm DU-tipped shell of the kind fired by American tank-busting A-10 planes, Mr Laity criticised the media for blowing the issue out of all proportion. He said DU also had several civilian applications and was used as ballast in airliners and in the keels of many yachts. But the concerns refuse to fade and have been fuelled by the death of six Italian Balkan peacekeepers from cancer. Iraq yesterday demanded an inquiry into the use of DU shells in the 1991 Gulf war, suggesting that its cancer rates have soared in the aftermath.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Oscar-winning Voight, who has just finished filming Tomb Raider with his daughter Angelina Jolie, will play the late Howard Cosell, a television sports broadcaster who followed Ali's career from the beginning and was one of the first established sports figures to publicly acknowledge the boxer's Muslim name. The $105m (\u00a370.5m) film, which starts shooting today, ran into problems last year when Mann, the director of Heat and The Insider, fell out with Columbia pictures over the film's proposed budget (see earlier story) but after fraught negotiations and an agreement by both Smith and Mann to reduce their fees the project was given the green light in October. An insider on the film told gossip site Ain't It Cool News that Voight's portrayal is already worthy of an Oscar nomination. \"He's fantastic! You cannot recognise him!\" the 'source' told the site. \"Come next year, I predict, an Academy Award nomination for him! He's that impressive!\" The film, to be called simply Ali, will also star Mario Van Peebles as Malcolm X and Ron Silver as trainer Angelo Dundee. Voight will next be seen in the big budget second world war epic, Pearl Harbour.",

      "bodyText": "Advertising spend in traditional media is falling for the first time since the recession in the early 1990s, according to a report from ACNielsen MMS. Observers are split as to whether the downturn is the result of an economic slowdown or a shift in marketing spend. ACNielsen said that spend on media such as TV, cinema, press and outdoor has risen only 2.3% in the year to November 2000, failing to keep up with the 3.2% headline inflation rate. The figures, to be published by ACNielsen next week, show cinema advertising falling by 7.8% and outdoor advertising by 31.2%. Some analysts expressed concern because advertising is one of the first expenses to be cut by companies when they lose confidence in the business outlook. Others believe there has been a sea change in the marketing sector with big companies shifting spend from traditional media towards the internet, other interactive media and PR. Procter &amp; Gamble, the world's biggest advertiser, last year cut its UK traditional ad spend by 26%.

That high-minded claim sits oddly against the evidence cited in the judgment from lawyers acting for the youths and their relatives. Venables's solicitor told of \"relentless inquiries from the media\" over seven years, referring to various breaches of the existing injunctions. Due to the hostile publicity, after his release Venables was at risk of death or serious physical harm. </p> <p>Venables's father spoke of media pressure on his family which had forced them to move several times. It had been necessary to make his younger children wards of court to prevent publicity. Thompson's solicitor told a similar story, arguing that press behaviour in the past poses a real risk to the boy's life. He produced a recent Mail report about vigilantes in Wales threatening to burn down the home of a woman wrongly identified as the mother of one of the youths. Thompson's mother said she had changed her name and moved home eight times. </p> <p>As Butler-Sloss pointed out, it is newspapers who \"provide the information that would lead to the risk that others would take the law into their own hands\".

The manager of the secure unit where Thompson is held said reporters had approached his staff. Photographers with zoom lenses had tried to get pictures of the premises. Butler-Sloss observed: \"Not only is the media interest intense, it also demonstrates continued hostility towards the claimants.\" She pointed to a News of the World editorial stating \"the public has a right to know\" about the youths. The judge linked that threat to the paper's notorious \"naming and shaming\" exercise which revealed the identities of alleged paedophiles and led to vigilante acts. </p> <p>In a further example of the press's obsession, and its willingness to foment prejudice on the slightest evidence, yesterday's Sun ran a front page story headlined \"Bulger killer up for Diana award\". This claimed Thompson's secure unit had nominated him for a Princess of Wales memorial award. Whether true or not, and it is highly doubtful, the award director made it clear that such a nomination was ineligible under current rules. She has also complained to the PCC that the reporter used subterfuge to interview her, pretending to be the mother of an inmate. The story included an outraged quote from Bulger's mother.

Another smallish two-storey home in the pretty neighbourhood of Cat Mountain attracted more than 10 offers on its first day and eventually sold for $359,000 - three times the average house price in the state and much more than its list price. \"And it was nothing special,\" adds Mr Scanlan. \"It wasn't like a mansion or anything.\" Now, far fewer customers are phoning Mr Scanlan's number. \"In the last three months of last year, things slowed down considerably.

They haven't forgotten Gennifer, Monica, Paula, Dolly, Kathleen and Juanita, and funny Chinese money, and the renting of the Lincoln bedroom, and lying under oath, and so on. They know he is a bit of a lad, but they like a president who gets things done.</p> <p>Even as the White House packers groan about the cubic footage of his beloved books, Elvis is centre stage with a grin and a wave. Between trying to rewrite the doomsday scenario for the Middle East, lighting a Christmas tree in Belfast, and wowing the young people in Vietnam, he has issued no fewer than 29,000 pages of executive orders in his sunset days.</p> <p>Some sunset! In the last couple of months, he has created a vast new underwater nature preserve in Hawaii, given patients access to medical records, banned logging roads in some scenic areas, pardoned a bunch of malefactors, cut down on soot and smoke pollution and written new \"ergonomic\" rules to reduce office stress disorders.</p> <p>None of this has done anything for the office stress disorder the new boy Bush faces with a rightwing eager to reverse all this liberal do-gooding. They don't like the way Bush emerged bemused from a briefing lunch with Clinton at the White House where Clinton put on what he calls his \"razzle dazzle\". Given an evenly divided Congress, GW will find it hard to rewind the sunset.</p> <p>Clinton defies the laws of political gravity. That job approval rating is phenomenal. None of the popular postwar presidents - Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Reagan - had this level of public support in the waning months of their presidencies. Ike came closest; even the much loved Reagan slumped into the low 40s. But for the foolish 22nd Amendment of 1951, limiting presidents to two terms, a silvery-haired Clinton would be raising his right hand this month to take the oath of office for the third time. He could well have matched Franklin Roosevelt's unique four terms.</p> <p>Is he in FDR's league? No. FDR was tested by greater events and rose to them, but in economic terms Clinton has been the most successful Democratic president in the history of the party. Of course, like FDR, he does not enjoy unanimous approval. About 20% of the population resents Clinton as a rock 'n' roll president who infected the 90s with the permissive moral values of the 60s. The haters, who are chorusing \"Good riddance!\" are something else again, a hard, unforgiving core of Republican rightwingers who have foamed at \"slick Willie\".</p> <p>They are very like the crowd who went after FDR in the 30s, enraged that \"their\" White House had been usurped. Both in 1992 and 1996 Clinton won on a minority vote with the help of third party candidates. The right's sense of entitlement fed an incipient paranoia: When the deputy White House counsel Vincent W Foster Jr was found shot dead, he must have been murdered; when Hillary Clinton's Rose Law Firm billings could not be found, she had burned incriminating documents. The foamers were led by the Wall Street Journal, the Christian fundamentalists, moneybags Richard Mellon Scaife who financed the sleaze police, Rupert Murdoch's New York Post, Bill O'Reilly on Fox TV, a group of libertarian think-tanks, and Rush Limbaugh, epitomising a network of reactionary populists of radio who claim to vent for the real America. They are paler versions of Father Coughlin, who had audiences of 45m for his anti-FDR rants, but for eight years they have never stopped colluding to fit Clinton with a cement suit.</p> <p>The surprising thing is that they failed. Houdini has nothing on the man from Hope. At the start of his first term, in 1992, he tied the knots himself. He promised he would be a new Democrat, not a prisoner of bureaucrats or the party's tax and spend core. He would raise the ethical tone of government. He would stop the military discriminating against gays. He would act swiftly and decisively on the economy.</p> <p>The economy bequeathed him by George Bush senior was nothing like the great depression Franklin inherited from Herbert Hoover in 1932, but Bill, too, was going to have his hundred days of action on jobs and growth. And then he would match FDR's social security revolution with a national health service reform that would both lower medical costs and cover every American.</p> <p>It was a grand vision of what the presidency might achieve, but his eye on the stars, Clinton stumbled badly. Given the smoothness of the White House operation of the last four years, it is easy to forget that when they came in the boys from Arkansas were the gang that couldn't shoot straight. Clinton insisted he must have a woman as attorney general, then nominated Zoe Baird knowing she had broken the law by failing to pay taxes for a housekeeper. The radio talk circuit blew its fuses. See, Willie was a liberal hypocrite, exploiting working people and excepting his friends from laws ordinary people had to obey.</p> <p>Next, he gave the country the wrong idea of his priorities by getting into an immediate hassle with the military - his military - over gays. He had to retreat into accepting a \"don't ask, don't tell\" formula. It was, he himself now recognises, \"a dumbass\" thing to do.</p> <p>He had led the country to expect rapid action on the economy, which had emerged from recession but was still throwing up record deficits, threatening inflation. \"It's the economy, stupid\" was his campaign theme, but seven months into office, and with a Democratic Congress, he was still unable to get a budget agreed. He was sandwiched between Democrats who wanted money for investment he had promised (including the much-mocked \"information highway\") and cross-party alliances in the Senate determined not to vote tax increases to pay for them. He had to fight his own party and its rooted protectionism.</p> <p>It is to his enduring credit that he broke the Democratic mould. In August 1993, he at last persuaded enough Democrats to vote immediate tax increases and phased spending cuts - the first real attempt to contain the federal deficit in more than a decade and passed only on the casting vote of Al Gore. Not a single Republican in House or Senate voted for it.

      "byline": "Matt Wells and Rebecca Allison",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Royal Opera House is to announce today that Tony Hall, head of BBC news and current affairs, is to be its new executive director. </p> <p>The announcement will end weeks of speculation about the successor to Michael Kaiser, who left the post in December after two years. His predecessors lasted only seven and five months before resigning. </p> <p>A BBC source confirmed that Mr Hall, director of BBC News for nine years, would be announcing his resignation today to head the ROH. His appointment comes after a wrangle over his salary and pension package. </p> <p>He has no experience in arts administration and was initially regarded as a surprise outside candidate. But the ROH was determined to appoint him and is understood to have been frustrated at his last minute wrangling. </p> <p>It is believed that the stumbling block was the big drop in salary. Mr Hall earns around \u00a3250,000 at the BBC, whereas the opera house salary is around \u00a3150,000. The deal was finalised at the ROH's board meeting yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Hall, 49, beat off formidable competition from a shortlist thought to include high profile figures such as John Tusa, who runs the Barbican, Pierre Audi, artistic director of Netherlands Opera, and Richard Lyttelton, president of EMI Classics. </p> <p>While Mr Hall can in no sense be called an opera expert, there is a logic to the choice. </p> <p>Antonio Pappano, music director of the Monnaie Opera in Brussels, becomes music director at Covent Garden in 2002 and has been assured of artistic control. An opera heavyweight as executive director might have got in the way, leading to artistic clashes. Mr Hall's role is seen as strictly financial and administrative. </p> <p>The board splits roughly between administrators and artists. The former had to convince the latter that employing an executive director with no experience of opera or ballet would not lead to a diminution in artistic standards. </p> <p>The meeting, at which the nomination committee put forward Mr Hall's candidature to the full board, was lively, but it appears that his supporters were pushing at an open door. </p> <p>Mr Hall will be expected to make the house work not least in public relations terms. He will work closely with Sir Colin Southgate, ROH chairman, who was rumoured to have clashed with Mr Kaiser. </p> <p>The past five years have been a public relations disaster for the opera house, and there were times when it looked as if the government might pull the plug on its public funding. </p> <p>The period in which the opera and ballet companies had to perform away from Covent Garden, during a \u00a3214m refurbishment, was financially disastrous; a fly-on-the-wall documentary about the opera house was a huge embarrassment; and the productions it has staged since the reopening have met with at best mixed reviews. </p> <p>Mr Kaiser's resignation to join the Kennedy Centre in Washington was a blow which the ROH could ill afford. He cut prices and helped to attract audiences to what has been seen as an elitist institution. Tensions remain between those who want to widen its appeal and those who fear it may be \"dumbed down\". </p> <p>Mr Hall is likely to stay at the BBC until the general election, expected in the spring. He applied for the job of director general last year, but was defeated by Greg Dyke.

      "bodyText": "The Royal Opera House is to announce today that Tony Hall, head of BBC news and current affairs, is to be its new executive director. The announcement will end weeks of speculation about the successor to Michael Kaiser, who left the post in December after two years. His predecessors lasted only seven and five months before resigning. A BBC source confirmed that Mr Hall, director of BBC News for nine years, would be announcing his resignation today to head the ROH. His appointment comes after a wrangle over his salary and pension package. He has no experience in arts administration and was initially regarded as a surprise outside candidate. But the ROH was determined to appoint him and is understood to have been frustrated at his last minute wrangling. It is believed that the stumbling block was the big drop in salary. Mr Hall earns around \u00a3250,000 at the BBC, whereas the opera house salary is around \u00a3150,000. The deal was finalised at the ROH's board meeting yesterday. Mr Hall, 49, beat off formidable competition from a shortlist thought to include high profile figures such as John Tusa, who runs the Barbican, Pierre Audi, artistic director of Netherlands Opera, and Richard Lyttelton, president of EMI Classics. While Mr Hall can in no sense be called an opera expert, there is a logic to the choice. Antonio Pappano, music director of the Monnaie Opera in Brussels, becomes music director at Covent Garden in 2002 and has been assured of artistic control. An opera heavyweight as executive director might have got in the way, leading to artistic clashes. Mr Hall's role is seen as strictly financial and administrative. The board splits roughly between administrators and artists. The former had to convince the latter that employing an executive director with no experience of opera or ballet would not lead to a diminution in artistic standards. The meeting, at which the nomination committee put forward Mr Hall's candidature to the full board, was lively, but it appears that his supporters were pushing at an open door. Mr Hall will be expected to make the house work not least in public relations terms. He will work closely with Sir Colin Southgate, ROH chairman, who was rumoured to have clashed with Mr Kaiser. The past five years have been a public relations disaster for the opera house, and there were times when it looked as if the government might pull the plug on its public funding. The period in which the opera and ballet companies had to perform away from Covent Garden, during a \u00a3214m refurbishment, was financially disastrous; a fly-on-the-wall documentary about the opera house was a huge embarrassment; and the productions it has staged since the reopening have met with at best mixed reviews. Mr Kaiser's resignation to join the Kennedy Centre in Washington was a blow which the ROH could ill afford. He cut prices and helped to attract audiences to what has been seen as an elitist institution. Tensions remain between those who want to widen its appeal and those who fear it may be \"dumbed down\". Mr Hall is likely to stay at the BBC until the general election, expected in the spring. He applied for the job of director general last year, but was defeated by Greg Dyke. Although the two are said to get on well, insiders believe he may feel out of place in the new regime. Mr Hall's departure will set off a succession battle at the BBC. Favourite to take over is his deputy, Richard Sambrook, who has impressed Mr Dyke.",

      "bodyText": "Chancellor Gordon Brown will today mark another stage in the government's vision of a million-strong volunteer army by claiming Britain is on the brink of a new era of active citizenship. Drawing on previous government pledges prepared by the government's active community unit sited in the Home Office, Mr Brown will claim that within five years every individual should be committed to giving a two hours a week to the community. He will also suggest 100,000 over-50s could work in the voluntary sector, including hospitals and schools. Most recent surveys have shown there has been a decline in volunteering by both older and younger people, threatening a major new pressure on the public purse. Mr Brown is to present the change as part of a move towards the decentralisation of government and the handing of power to local areas. Much of his thinking is derived from an analysis prepared on neighbourhood renewal developed by the social exclusion unit. The 1m extra volunteers was set as a formal government target in a review established by the Treasury during the preparation of the summer comprehensive spending review. Mr Brown claimed last night: \"Instead of people looking always to Whitehall for solutions in locality after locality more and more people will themselves take charge of the decisions that most affect them. That is perhaps humbling for government, but quite the opposite for communities.\" His remarks are likely to be met with scepticism in Labour local government, which believes it has suffered from ever greater centralisation and the loss of local government influence. However some Labour analysts believe power needs to be devolved below formal local government representation to local estates and neighbourhoods, or parishes. Previous research undertaken for the government has shown that volunteers rejected Tony Blair's vision of a new giving age, suggesting the phrase was patronising and failed to capture the dynamic in volunteering.",

A draft of the NAO report heavily criticises Jack Straw's department and the operation of the probation service's information service, a system bought from French company Bull. The report, published yesterday in Computer Weekly magazine, reveals that costs rose 70% above the original budget, despite the system's failure to perform as well as expected. The deal made with Bull has been declared legally suspect, and the NAO warns: \"Legal advice received by the Home Office suggests that any new purchase orders raised under the enabling agreement are unlawful. \"As a result, for example, the Home Office is unable under the existing agreement to fund any expansion in the capacity of the current network to accommodate increased electronic traffic.\" The indictment is a severe embarrassment for the Home Office after its installation of a computer system into the passport office was criticised when it led to long delays. The Home Office has also been criticised for failures of its computer system for the immigration service. The National Probation Service Information Systems Strategy (NPSISS) and a Common Case Management System (Crams) were intended to revolutionise the tracking of offenders. The Home Office also spent \u00a316m to avoid disruption from a millennium bug and \u00a310m on maintenance, but now a new system is expected to be ordered. The NAO records significant defects, including problems in transferring cases between local probation services. Probation officers complain that the system is difficult to use, is unable to list dangerous offenders separately, is confused by similar first and surnames such as \"John\" and \"Johnson\", and mixes up people with the same date of birth. A number even claim that it slows down on national lottery days, insisting that it uses the same electronic circuits as the game. Harry Fletcher, assistant general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers, said: \"The investigation vindicates the campaign that probation staff have run for the last six years. \"Crams has been a complete waste of taxpayers' money. \"It is crucial that the Home Office now learns from past mistakes to ensure that the new system is efficient and effective.\" An NAO spokesman said yesterday: \"This report has yet to be agreed with the Home Office, and we do not comment on draft reports.\" The Home Office said it did not want to comment until the report was officially published this year.",

She wrote plays, short stories, and most recently had adapted one of her novels into an opera libretto. But she is known in particular for two outstanding children's books: Clever Polly and the Stupid Wolf and Marianne Dreams.</p> <p>The first is a collection of stories for young children in which the resourceful and kind Polly outwits the enthusiastic but dim wolf over a number of encounters which are close enough to be alarming while funny enough to be reassuringly safe.</p> <p>The second, for older readers, is an extended fantasy, as Marianne, convalescing and so with time on her hands, creates and enters a dream house where she meets Mark and faces the threat of destruction. Both are timeless and, though published in 1955 and 1958 respectively, are in print as \"classics\", with Clever Polly and the Stupid Wolf remaining a staple of the curriculum in primary schools.</p> <p>Though externally so different, they show Storr's skill and enthusiasm as a story teller as well as reflecting her ability to create characters of remarkable insight, whose stories she tells in parallels of fantasy and reality.</p> <p>This particular characteristic may come directly from Storr's professional background. Educated at St Paul's Girls' School, she went on to read English at Newnham College, Cambridge, and then qualified as a doctor and trained as a psychiatrist, working in London hospitals through the 50s and early 60s, before combining the two educational backgrounds by becoming an editor for Penguin Books.</p> <p>Her clinical training enabled her to capture so surely the child's-eye view of the world.

More interestingly, as in one of Storr's earliest titles, Polly and the Giant's Bride, it allows for a story in which there is no way of telling exactly what happens, allowing readers to interpret for themselves - a remarkable feat to bring off in a story for the very young.</p> <p>Storr was married first to writer and psychiatrist Anthony Storr, with whom she had three daughters. But, like many other writers for children, Storr always claimed that she wrote for herself more than for children in general or even for any particular child.</p> <p>While she was careful to keep up to date with contemporary externals, checking facts about schools, clothes, hobbies and, above all, speech, with her grandchildren and their friends, the impetus for what she wrote came from within herself.</p> <p>She never forgot what it felt like to be a child, retaining the details of her own childhood absolutely. (Her father was a barrister and she was brought up in Kensington, with two brothers, one of whom was Hugo Cole, former music critic of the Guardian.) In particular, throughout her life Storr was captivated by the special, private make-believe world of dolls and their owners, knowing how \"real\" they could be. She kept forever her own favourite doll, Ruthy, who inspired her first book, Ingeborg and Ruthy (1940). For a few lucky children, she made the most elaborate dolls' clothes which carefully mirrored the owners' own tastes as to jeans or corduroy trousers, pyjamas or night-dresses.</p> <p>Though Storr may not have written directly for her own daughters, they did inspire her to write specific stories, especially Polly, for whom the stories about the wolf were written and whose name was used so freely. From Emma came the inspiration for the tomboy Lucy stories, while Marianne Dreams was written for Sophia, with the name taken from a close schoolfriend. Much later, her grandson Hugo came to feature in Hugo and his Grandma and Hugo and His Grandma's Washing Day, two stories in which Storr parodied herself as an incompetent grandmother.</p> <p>Storr's second husband was the economist Thomas Balogh, whom she married in 1970. Her own children having left home, she moved with him to a different house in Hampstead and continued to write, inspired partly by her own grandchildren and by her new extended family.</p> <p>Storr did not like throngs of children, but forged very strong relationships with the individual ones she knew. She was never patronising or condescending to children, either in her writing or in person. With them, as with adults, she combined serious discussion with brilliant and infectious humour.</p> <p>She is survived by her three daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 Catherine Storr, author, born July 21 1913; died January 6 2001</p>",

Storr did not like throngs of children, but forged very strong relationships with the individual ones she knew. She was never patronising or condescending to children, either in her writing or in person. With them, as with adults, she combined serious discussion with brilliant and infectious humour. She is survived by her three daughters. \u0095 Catherine Storr, author, born July 21 1913; died January 6 2001",

      "body": "<p>Elizabeth Anscombe, who has died aged 81, was considered by some to be the greatest English philosopher of her generation. She was professor of philosophy at Cambridge from 1970 to 1986, having already, as a research fellow at Oxford in the 50s, helped change the course of moral philosophy. Also influential in philosophy of mind, she pioneered contemporary action theory, and the pre-eminent philosopher Donald Davidson called her 1957 monograph Intention the best work on practical reasoning since Aristotle. The philosophical world owes her an enormous debt, too, for bringing Wittgenstein, probably the greatest philosopher of the 20th century, to public knowledge. </p> <p>Anscombe went to Sydenham high school, where her reading between the ages of 12 and 15 led her to convert to Roman Catholicism. She got a first in Greats at St Hugh's College, Oxford, but came to inveigh against the dryness of Oxford philosophy. This was because she had come under the spell of Ludwig Wittgenstein, for whose classes she travelled to Cambridge every week. She became Wittgenstein's close friend and proselytiser, even adopting his mannerisms - the anguished head in hands, furrowed brow, long silences - and the tinge of an Austrian accent. </p> <p>After his death in 1951 (she was at his deathbed), she became one of his three notoriously intractable literary executors, and co-edited his posthumous works. Her translation of his greatest work, the Philosophical Investigations, was remarkable. It is quoted all over the world as if it were verbatim Wittgenstein rather than a translation, being written in an English style which is itself compelling. </p> <p>Wittgenstein famously said \"philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday\", and spoke of trying to cure such problems by examining the way we use concepts. Anscombe applied a Wittgenstein-type analytic therapy to philosophy of mind. But her application was far more systematic and thoroughgoing than Wittgenstein's cryptic, suggestive hints, and was also distinctively her own. In Intention, she criticised the way philosophers since Descartes have had a conception of knowledge, even knowledge of one's own actions, as \"incorrigibly contemplative\", passive, speculative. In fact, she said, we know what our intentions are without observation; and between someone observing, and someone intending and performing, an action, there is what she called a difference in the \"direction of fit\" (of action to thought). </p> <p>She gives the famous illustration of the contents of a basket which a shopper fills according to a list, and which a detective compiles a list of. If the shopper finds any discrepancy between his list and what is actually in the basket, he rectifies this not by altering the list (practical thought) but by altering what's in the basket (the action performed). If the detective wants to rectify discrepancies between his list (observational thought) and what's in the basket (the other's action observed), then he can indeed do so merely by altering the list. But our actions are intentional only under a description, said Anscombe, so that under one description (\"I wanted to help\") an action may be intentional, under others (\"I interfered\", \"I stopped play\") unintentional. </p> <p>Anscombe thought that modern philosophy had also misunderstood ethics. In her seminal paper Modern Moral Philosophy (1958), she argued that notions like \"moral obligation\", \"moral duty\", \"morally right\", and \"morally wrong\", are now vacuous hangovers from the Judaeo-Christian idea of a law-giving God. Anscombe, of course, firmly believed in God herself, but she was examining the way language was actually used, and ethics done. She argued that \"ought\" has become \"a word of mere mesmeric force\", since it no longer has the corollary \"because we are commanded by God\". </p> <p>Philosophers, however, have tried to find content in the deracinated ethical concepts, and failing to, have been induced to supply \"an alternative (very fishy) content\", such as that the right action is the one that produces the best possible consequences. However purportedly different, in fact, all contemporary moral philosophies lead to this sort of \"consequentialism\" (it was Anscombe who coined that now-indispensable term), which blithely countenances the execution of an innocent person as a potentially right action. Anscombe famously asserted of someone who thought in this way, \"I do not want to argue with him: he shows a corrupt mind.\" She urged the abandonment of \"the law conception of ethics\" and a return to the avowedly secular Aristotelian concepts of practical reasoning and virtue. And she insisted that it was no longer possible to do moral philosophy without doing philosophy of mind, thoroughly investigating concepts such as \"action\", \"intention\", and \"pleasure\" in their non-moral sense. </p> <p>Two years earlier, in 1956, she had demonstrated in a very practical way her opposition to consequentialism. When it was proposed that Oxford should give President Truman an honorary degree, she and two others opposed this because of his responsibility for the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Although overruled, they forced a vote, instead of the customary automatic rubber-stamping of the proposal. \"For men to choose to kill the innocent as a means to their ends is always murder,\" declared Anscombe's pamphlet, Mr Truman's Degree. It sarcastically condoled with the Censor of St Catherine's for having to make a speech \"which should pretend to show that a couple of massacres to a man's credit are not exactly a reason for not showing him honour\". </p> <p>Anscombe was never afraid to voice unpopular views, scandalising liberal colleagues such as Bernard Williams with her paper against contraception (later published in revised form by the Catholic Truth Society) and condemnation of homosexuality. </p> <p>Outspoken, often rude, she was sometimes dubbed \"Dragon Lady\". For a time she sported a monocle, and had a trick of raising her eyebrows and letting it fall on her ample bosom, which somehow made her yet more daunting. But, while giving short shrift to pretension and pomposity, she took endless pains with those students she considered serious. Her exhilarating tutorials went on for hours, leaving everyone exhausted; students could drop into her house at any time to discuss philosophy among the dirty nappies. Married to Peter Geach, a fellow-philosopher and Catholic, she was always called \"Miss Anscombe\", which caused some consternation at the Radcliffe Infirmary whenever she turned up to give birth (she had seven children). </p> <p>Perhaps Anscombe's best work was done in the 50s, but her three-volume Collected Philosophical Papers (1981) contain trenchant papers on epistemology, metaphysics, history of philosophy, and philosophy of religion. Causality and Determination, her inaugural lecture on becoming professor of Cambridge in 1970, presented an extraordinarily original and controversial view of causation. </p> <p>An affectionate tribute on her retirement in 1986 called her \"a modern Daniel in the lions' den\", but, although doggedly Catholic, Anscombe could also be radical and was never straitlaced. She was notorious for a forthright foulmouthedness which was only enhanced by the beauty of her voice. When presenting a paper on pleasure, she distinguished extrinsic pleasures - things we enjoy because of the description they fall under - and intrinsic pleasures - things we enjoy regardless of how they are described; and she cited, as an example of the latter, \"shitting\", strongly pronouncing the double \"t\", and with such sternness that her academic audience were too daunted to laugh. (Unfortunately this was probably one of the many papers she threw away as insufficiently good.) </p> <p>Once, threatened by a mugger in Chicago, she told him that that was no way to treat a visitor. They soon fell into conversation and he accompanied her, admonishing her for being in such a dangerous neighbourhood. She chain-smoked for some years, but bargained with God, when her second son was seriously ill, that she would give up smoking cigarettes if he recovered. Feeling the strain of this the following year, she decided that her bargain had not mentioned cigars or pipes, and took to smoking these. </p> <p>Except when pregnant, she wore trousers, often under a tunic, which, in the 50s and 60s, was often disapproved of. Once, entering a smart restaurant in Boston, she was told that ladies were not admitted in trousers. She simply took them off. When she threatened one of her children, \"If you do that again, I'll put you on the train to Bicester\", and he did, she felt obliged, given her views on fulfilling promises, actually to put him on the train. Bluff, courageous, determined, loyal, she argued that the word \"I\" does not refer to anything, but she certainly believed in the soul. </p> <p>She is survived by her husband and their four daughters and three sons. </p> <p>\u0095 Gertrude Elizabeth Mary Anscombe, philosopher, born March 18 1919; died January 5 2001</p>",

Having returned earlier that day, the great warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) is visiting the home of Yu (Michelle Yeoh). \"Monk Zheng said you were at Wudan Mountain,\" says Yu. \"He said you were practising deep meditation.\" \"Yes.\" \"The mountain must be so peaceful. I envy you.\" \"I left the training early.\" \"Why? You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.\" \"During my meditation training, I came to a place of deep silence. I was surrounded by light. Time and space disappeared. I had come to a place my master had never told me about.\" \"You were enlightened?\" \"No. I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment. Instead, I was surrounded by an endless sorrow. I couldn't bear it. I broke off my meditation. I couldn't go on. There was something pulling me back.\" \"What was it?\" \"Something I can't let go of. You are leaving soon?\" \"We're preparing a convoy for a delivery to Peking.\" \"Perhaps I could ask you to deliver something to Sir Te for me.\" Li produces a long package; unwrapping it, he reveals an ancient, beautifully engraved sword. Yu gasps. \"The Green Destiny Sword? You're giving it to Sir Te?\" \"I am. He has always been our greatest protector.\" \"I don't understand. How can you part with it? It has always been with you.\" Slowly, Li shakes his head. \"Too many men have died at its edge.

      "body": "<p>The Israeli government last night stood accused of sanctioning the systematic hunting down and assassination of Palestinian activists it deems to be security threats in the West Bank and Gaza.</p> <p>As Ehud Barak, Israel's prime minister, clings to the tattered shreds of his reputation as a peacemaker before next month's elections, Israel's Peace Now movement broke a long silence to allege that he is giving the army a free hand to eliminate suspected opponents.</p> <p>The eruption of anger against Israel's assassination campaign follows the slaying on New Year's Eve of a middle-aged dentist who was a senior official in the West Bank health service, and a leading figure in Yasser Arafat's Fatah organisation, Thabet Thabet. For many peace activists, Thabet was a friend, and trusted ally. He was among the first Palestinians to dare to reach out to Israelis during the late 1980s.</p> <p>The shock of his death - delivered by long-range automatic weapons fire outside his home in broad daylight - has brought belated scrutiny to a military strategy for containing the intifada in the West Bank and Gaza that has been in force since November 9.</p> <p>There is no accurate count of those systematically targeted for elimination as the military does not always own up to specific killings. Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority says 19 people have been assassinated; other Palestinian sources put the figure as high as 30.</p> <p>Israel has always claimed the right to selectively assassinate its enemies. But the new strategy threatens not only combatants, but those coordinating attacks. With Thabet's death, even the political leaders of Fatah are potential prey, although until the outbreak of the intifada, the group was Israel's main partner in the peace process, and cooperated with Israeli security services in arresting Hamas and Islamic Jihad bombers.</p> <p>The new assassination policy is confirmed by Israeli officials, who have owned up to some of the killings, and have not denied a hand in Thabet's death. \"I can tell you unequivocally what the policy is,\" the deputy defence minister, Ephraim Sneh, told Israel Radio last week. \"If anyone has committed or is planning to carry out terrorist attacks, he has to be hit. It is effective, precise, and just.\"</p> <p>But after weeks of stunned silence, the Israeli left is no longer willing to tolerate that argument - especially when applied to Thabet. \"Gunning down a person coming out of his house in broad daylight is a mafia-style action and it is not legitimate for any government,\" said Yehudith Harel.</p> <p>The outcry corresponds with a deepening sense of betrayal among the Israeli left, who accuse Mr Barak of squandering a chance to negotiate peace, and of resorting to military firepower and economic punishment to end the uprising.</p> <p>Ms Harel, a peace activist, worked closely with Thabet from 1988 to foster talks between Israelis and Palestinians. In 1994, when her soldier son was killed in a road accident, Thabet came to his funeral at a military cemetery - a generous act for a Palestinian nationalist who had been sentenced to three years' house arrest in the early 1970s.</p> <p>\"What kind of military activity is this?\" she asked. \"This is absolutely illegal.\"</p> <p>On Tuesday, a lawyer acting for Thabet's widow set out to prove just that, lodging an injunction in Israel's supreme court to stop the army from killing activists of Yasser Arafat's Fatah organisation, and Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Israel does not have capital punishment.</p> <p>\"All these killings are against Israeli law,\" said Naila Attiya, a Palestinian citizen of Israel. \"There are assassination plans, and maybe by going to the court we can stop them from being carried out.\"</p> <p>Yesterday, Palestinian officials said they were gathering evidence to try Mr Barak and his government for war crimes.</p> <p>\"We consider the Israeli government, the prime minister and all members of the Israeli government as criminals who should be prosecuted,\" Yasser Abd Rabbo, the Palestinian information minister, told a press conference. He said the assassinations could derail what little is left of the peace process.</p> <p><b>'Initiated attacks'</b><br></p> <p>Israeli military officials obliquely announced the new policy in early November, saying they were moving towards \"initiated attacks\" to stop Fatah militia, known locally as tanzim , from firing on Jewish outposts or settlers in the West Bank, or placing roadside bombs. The first to die under the policy, Hussein Abayat, was killed on November 9.</p> <p>Soon after, the military stepped up the liquidation policy, calculating that the targeting of Fatah activists would be less damaging to Israel's international image then the bombardments of Palestinian cities ordered earlier in the intifada.</p> <p>Until Thabet was killed on December 31, the Israeli public was broadly supportive. But the assassination of such a high-profile figure was too much for many to stomach.</p> <p>\"He was a man of peace,\" said Uri Avnery, who has been active in the Israeli peace movement for nearly 30 years. \"He cooperated with us for years. Even when he was under arrest years ago, he spoke about a peace. But he was also a patriot, and when the war of liberation started, I suppose he was part of the mass movement.\"</p> <p>Ms Attiya's appeal to the supreme court, which she says is based on the Geneva Convention as well as Israeli law, marks the first time a prime minister has been asked to answer in court for Israel's decades-old policy of assassinating opponents it accuses of plotting acts of terror.</p> <p>A former commando, Mr Barak famously put on a blond wig and a dress to sneak into Beirut 27 years ago to assassinate three Palestinians suspected of the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. He was also involved in the 1988 killing in Tunis of Abu Jihad - one of the most romantic figures of the Palestinian movement.</p> <p>Mr Barak - who doubles as Israel's defence minister - told a recent meeting of the foreign and defence committee of the parliament that he had given his approval to the operations. Several MPs asked Mr Barak to stop. He refused.</p> <p>In an interview on Newsnight, he issued a coy denial of a new assassination policy, but admitted: \"There is a clear kind of permanent policy here to hit those who hit you.\"</p> <p>For Israeli peace activists, Thabet's killing is especially tragic as he was directly responsible for saving the lives of 20 Israeli soldiers only weeks ago. In mid-October, days after a Palestinian mob hacked to death two Israeli reservists who strayed into the West Bank city of Ramallah, Thabet intervened with the Israeli army to arrange the return of soldiers who had blundered into Tulkaram.</p> <p>\"This is a reward for people who save the lives of Israeli soldiers,\" said Bassam Eid of the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\" target=\"_new\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian national authority</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\" target=\"_new\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm\" target=\"_new\">Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p> <p><b>Interactive</b> <br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/wto/flash/0,6189,380127,00.html\">Interactive history of Israel</a></p>",

The eruption of anger against Israel's assassination campaign follows the slaying on New Year's Eve of a middle-aged dentist who was a senior official in the West Bank health service, and a leading figure in Yasser Arafat's Fatah organisation, Thabet Thabet. For many peace activists, Thabet was a friend, and trusted ally. He was among the first Palestinians to dare to reach out to Israelis during the late 1980s. The shock of his death - delivered by long-range automatic weapons fire outside his home in broad daylight - has brought belated scrutiny to a military strategy for containing the intifada in the West Bank and Gaza that has been in force since November 9. There is no accurate count of those systematically targeted for elimination as the military does not always own up to specific killings. Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority says 19 people have been assassinated; other Palestinian sources put the figure as high as 30. Israel has always claimed the right to selectively assassinate its enemies. But the new strategy threatens not only combatants, but those coordinating attacks. With Thabet's death, even the political leaders of Fatah are potential prey, although until the outbreak of the intifada, the group was Israel's main partner in the peace process, and cooperated with Israeli security services in arresting Hamas and Islamic Jihad bombers. The new assassination policy is confirmed by Israeli officials, who have owned up to some of the killings, and have not denied a hand in Thabet's death. \"I can tell you unequivocally what the policy is,\" the deputy defence minister, Ephraim Sneh, told Israel Radio last week. \"If anyone has committed or is planning to carry out terrorist attacks, he has to be hit. It is effective, precise, and just.\" But after weeks of stunned silence, the Israeli left is no longer willing to tolerate that argument - especially when applied to Thabet. \"Gunning down a person coming out of his house in broad daylight is a mafia-style action and it is not legitimate for any government,\" said Yehudith Harel. The outcry corresponds with a deepening sense of betrayal among the Israeli left, who accuse Mr Barak of squandering a chance to negotiate peace, and of resorting to military firepower and economic punishment to end the uprising. Ms Harel, a peace activist, worked closely with Thabet from 1988 to foster talks between Israelis and Palestinians. In 1994, when her soldier son was killed in a road accident, Thabet came to his funeral at a military cemetery - a generous act for a Palestinian nationalist who had been sentenced to three years' house arrest in the early 1970s. \"What kind of military activity is this?\" she asked. \"This is absolutely illegal.\" On Tuesday, a lawyer acting for Thabet's widow set out to prove just that, lodging an injunction in Israel's supreme court to stop the army from killing activists of Yasser Arafat's Fatah organisation, and Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Israel does not have capital punishment. \"All these killings are against Israeli law,\" said Naila Attiya, a Palestinian citizen of Israel. \"There are assassination plans, and maybe by going to the court we can stop them from being carried out.\" Yesterday, Palestinian officials said they were gathering evidence to try Mr Barak and his government for war crimes. \"We consider the Israeli government, the prime minister and all members of the Israeli government as criminals who should be prosecuted,\" Yasser Abd Rabbo, the Palestinian information minister, told a press conference. He said the assassinations could derail what little is left of the peace process. 'Initiated attacks' Israeli military officials obliquely announced the new policy in early November, saying they were moving towards \"initiated attacks\" to stop Fatah militia, known locally as tanzim , from firing on Jewish outposts or settlers in the West Bank, or placing roadside bombs. The first to die under the policy, Hussein Abayat, was killed on November 9. Soon after, the military stepped up the liquidation policy, calculating that the targeting of Fatah activists would be less damaging to Israel's international image then the bombardments of Palestinian cities ordered earlier in the intifada. Until Thabet was killed on December 31, the Israeli public was broadly supportive. But the assassination of such a high-profile figure was too much for many to stomach. \"He was a man of peace,\" said Uri Avnery, who has been active in the Israeli peace movement for nearly 30 years. \"He cooperated with us for years. Even when he was under arrest years ago, he spoke about a peace. But he was also a patriot, and when the war of liberation started, I suppose he was part of the mass movement.\" Ms Attiya's appeal to the supreme court, which she says is based on the Geneva Convention as well as Israeli law, marks the first time a prime minister has been asked to answer in court for Israel's decades-old policy of assassinating opponents it accuses of plotting acts of terror. A former commando, Mr Barak famously put on a blond wig and a dress to sneak into Beirut 27 years ago to assassinate three Palestinians suspected of the massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. He was also involved in the 1988 killing in Tunis of Abu Jihad - one of the most romantic figures of the Palestinian movement. Mr Barak - who doubles as Israel's defence minister - told a recent meeting of the foreign and defence committee of the parliament that he had given his approval to the operations. Several MPs asked Mr Barak to stop. He refused. In an interview on Newsnight, he issued a coy denial of a new assassination policy, but admitted: \"There is a clear kind of permanent policy here to hit those who hit you.\" For Israeli peace activists, Thabet's killing is especially tragic as he was directly responsible for saving the lives of 20 Israeli soldiers only weeks ago. In mid-October, days after a Palestinian mob hacked to death two Israeli reservists who strayed into the West Bank city of Ramallah, Thabet intervened with the Israeli army to arrange the return of soldiers who had blundered into Tulkaram. \"This is a reward for people who save the lives of Israeli soldiers,\" said Bassam Eid of the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group.

      "bodyText": "The good news for Nigel Hastilow, prospective Tory candidate for Edgbaston who admitted his party is widely regarded as a \"lost cause\", is that his will now be a high profile election campaign. The bad news is that his admission - made in his monthly column on his website - has already brought him ridicule from the prime minister who yesterday enlisted him as ammunition during question time. Referring to Mr Hastilow's admission that \"for many voters and most of the media, the Conservative party is a lost cause\", Mr Blair told MPs, to jeers and laughter: \"If that's what their own candidates think of the Conservative party, I can't wait for the verdict of the country.\" Last night, Tory central office sought to play down Mr Hastilow's apparent outburst, with a spokesman insisting his future was not in question. \"You can't sack someone for being naive,\" he added. But Julie Kirkbride, the Tory MP for nearby Bromsgrove, who is featured beaming alongside him on his website, declined to leap to his defence, and Mr Hastilow himself hastily posted a message on his website insisting the so-called monthly column was written nearly a year ago, and that William Hague had \"taken our party a long way since I wrote this article\". The former Birmingham Post editor worked in the lobby in the early 90s and is described by a former lobby colleague as \"one of the best journalists I have come across\". Former employees believe he will not regret his frankness. As one said: \"He's a vigorous, whole-hearted guy who believes a lot of the people around William Hague should get their fingers out, and if he seems to be slagging them off it probably just reflects his private views.\"",

Once at her sister-in-law's house Mrs Cuthbert was reluctant to enter but Shipman said it would be all right because \"she looked like she was asleep\", sitting upright in a chair. John Grenville, a GP, told the hearing that if the widow had died of heart failure she would have been gasping for air, trying to open windows and standing up, before collapsing to the floor. He said that although it was \"theoretically possible\" for her to have died of heart failure it was unlikely. When asked if an injection of morphine could lead to her dying in an upright position in a chair he replied: \"The answer to that is yes because we know that has happened.\" It was also revealed that Shipman had made as many as eight alterations to Mrs Cuthbert's cremation certificate and that an entry in the surgery visits books, made by Shipman, stated the widow was complaining of nothing more than a sore bunion.",

The number far exceeds expectations.</p> <p>Liam Donaldson will say that what was done in the name of the NHS over many years was an affront to families who had lost their loved ones.</p> <p>Addressing a public seminar, whose audience will include top pathologists and other senior doctors, he will say \"some of the past practices around organ retention belong to an era where decisions were made by the NHS for patients, but not with patients.</p> <p>\"This has caused a period of immense distress for families, especially in places like Bristol and Liverpool, when they found out their children's organs were taken without their knowledge. Something went seriously wrong in the way the health service dealt with the issue of organ retention.\"</p> <p>Prof Donaldson will pledge that the government \"will do whatever it takes to put things right, changing the law if necessary to ensure that relatives are given the right kind of information so they can give consent in a fully informed way if they choose to do so.\"</p> <p>At Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool, where an inquiry will report shortly, more than 3,000 children's organs have been discovered; other hospitals were not thought to have anything like that number.</p> <p>The chief medical officer will offer an unmitigated apology and assurances for the future to the parents of the Alder Hey children and those whose children died and had organs removed at the Bristol royal infirmary who have been invited to today's seminar. None of the parents knew that hearts, brains and other whole organs would be removed and kept after the autopsy on their son or daughter.</p> <p>Ian Kennedy, chairman of the inquiry into children's deaths following heart surgery at Bristol, published an interim report into organ retention at the hospital last May. He found that the law was complex and obscure. Different laws covered hospital autopsies - which help doctors find out about the progress of disease - and those ordered by the coroner to find out the cause of death. Prof Kennedy recommended at least a new code of practice and preferably a new law.</p> <p>Prof Donaldson has issued interim guidance to hospitals, requiring them to tell parents and relatives exactly what an autopsy involves and get their explicit permission if there is any need to remove organs.</p> <p>Today's seminar is part of his information-gathering process on the way to producing his final report to the health secretary, Alan Milburn. That is expected, along with the Alder Hey inquiry report, before the end of the month.</p> <p>Ed Bradley, chairman of the Alder Hey parents' support group, said more than 140 parents and relatives had travelled to London for the seminar and were glad of the opportunity to give evidence, \"however, we do question how much benefit can be gained from a one-day conference where we have only been given five minutes to represent our views.\" They also felt it would be more appropriate to discuss the way forward after the Alder Hey inquiry had reported.</p> <p>Alder Hey hospital is generally considered a special case, because whole organ systems were found to have been collected by a consultant pathologist, Dick Van Velzen, who is facing disciplinary hearings at the General Medical Council.</p> <p>Bristol parents at the seminar will be asking for Prof Kennedy's recommendations to be implemented and questioning why there has been no action since his report was published. \"It was quite clear the law was in a mess,\" said Steve Parker, chairman of the Bristol Heart Children's Action Group.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The true scale of the scandal of human organ retention by hospitals will be revealed today by the government's chief medical officer, who will tell parents and professionals that 50,000 organs are being stored in hospitals in England alone. The number far exceeds expectations. Liam Donaldson will say that what was done in the name of the NHS over many years was an affront to families who had lost their loved ones. Addressing a public seminar, whose audience will include top pathologists and other senior doctors, he will say \"some of the past practices around organ retention belong to an era where decisions were made by the NHS for patients, but not with patients. \"This has caused a period of immense distress for families, especially in places like Bristol and Liverpool, when they found out their children's organs were taken without their knowledge. Something went seriously wrong in the way the health service dealt with the issue of organ retention.\" Prof Donaldson will pledge that the government \"will do whatever it takes to put things right, changing the law if necessary to ensure that relatives are given the right kind of information so they can give consent in a fully informed way if they choose to do so.\" At Alder Hey hospital in Liverpool, where an inquiry will report shortly, more than 3,000 children's organs have been discovered; other hospitals were not thought to have anything like that number. The chief medical officer will offer an unmitigated apology and assurances for the future to the parents of the Alder Hey children and those whose children died and had organs removed at the Bristol royal infirmary who have been invited to today's seminar. None of the parents knew that hearts, brains and other whole organs would be removed and kept after the autopsy on their son or daughter. Ian Kennedy, chairman of the inquiry into children's deaths following heart surgery at Bristol, published an interim report into organ retention at the hospital last May. He found that the law was complex and obscure. Different laws covered hospital autopsies - which help doctors find out about the progress of disease - and those ordered by the coroner to find out the cause of death. Prof Kennedy recommended at least a new code of practice and preferably a new law. Prof Donaldson has issued interim guidance to hospitals, requiring them to tell parents and relatives exactly what an autopsy involves and get their explicit permission if there is any need to remove organs. Today's seminar is part of his information-gathering process on the way to producing his final report to the health secretary, Alan Milburn. That is expected, along with the Alder Hey inquiry report, before the end of the month. Ed Bradley, chairman of the Alder Hey parents' support group, said more than 140 parents and relatives had travelled to London for the seminar and were glad of the opportunity to give evidence, \"however, we do question how much benefit can be gained from a one-day conference where we have only been given five minutes to represent our views.\" They also felt it would be more appropriate to discuss the way forward after the Alder Hey inquiry had reported. Alder Hey hospital is generally considered a special case, because whole organ systems were found to have been collected by a consultant pathologist, Dick Van Velzen, who is facing disciplinary hearings at the General Medical Council. Bristol parents at the seminar will be asking for Prof Kennedy's recommendations to be implemented and questioning why there has been no action since his report was published. \"It was quite clear the law was in a mess,\" said Steve Parker, chairman of the Bristol Heart Children's Action Group.",

      "body": "<p>The home secretary, Jack Straw, yesterday promised a new mobile phone \"summit\" in an attempt to prevent the continuing surge in street robberies turning into the government's \"achilles heel\" in the debate on crime in the run-up to the general election.</p> <p>The unveiling by Mr Straw of an \"action plan\" and \"electronic toolkit\" for police and community groups to tackle the problem of robberies and street crime, including the boom sector of mobile phone thefts, is designed to intensify the fight against violent crime, particularly in the five cities, London, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol and Liverpool which account for 75% of street robberies in England and Wales.</p> <p>The home secretary wants to discuss with mobile phone manufacturers ways in which they could adopt a more expensive new \"chip\" which would incapacitate stolen phones and the use of personal identification numbers for the newly popular pre-paid \"pay as you go\" phones, which have no registered owner and cannot be cut off the network.</p> <p>Mr Straw's sudden interest yesterday in tackling the problem of street robbery may have as much to do with the publication next week of the annual recorded crime figures as to his determination to tackle the problem.</p> <p>It is expected that overall the figures - the last to be published before the election - will paint a comfortable picture for the Labour government, with continuing falls in the the big volume offences such as burglary and car thefts.</p> <p>But the exception is likely to be violent crime, and especially robberies involving personal property, which the last set of figures published in July showed had increased by 28% to March last year. If next week's figures show a further rise in street robbery it is likely to become one of the major flashpoints in the election. It also threatens to reopen the highly charged controversy over \"stop and search\" and undermine Downing Street's drive against \"yob culture\" which Tony Blair has already identified as a major theme of Labour's re-election campaign.</p> <p>Mr Straw first raised the problem of mobile phone thefts last July when he also talked of calling in the manufacturers alongside proposing to clamp down on public drunkeness and other \"yob behaviour\".</p> <p>Although violent crime accounts for only 13% of all offences, it is the surge in street robbery and the fear of being attacked by a stranger which most worry the public.</p> <p>The action plan to tackle violent crime published by Mr Straw yesterday points out that while last year's British Crime Survey reported a 21% fall in violent crime between 1995 and 1999, there is still a long way to go to reverse the long-term rise over the past 20 years.</p> <p>He argued that some of the long-term rise in violent crime can be regarded, in part, as good news because it represents increased reporting rates to the police by victims of domestic violence and racial attacks. He also stressed that Home Office criminologists claim that most of the long-term rise has been in what is called \"acquaintance violence\" and that violent attacks by strangers has risen at a much slower rate.</p> <p>The Home Office analysis and \"toolkit\" to tackle robbery published yesterday suggests that while in London the typical robber and victim is a young teenage boy aged 15 to 16 at school-leaving time, outside the capital the typical robber is an older male student aged about 18 to 20, with the largest number of robberies taking place during the \"hours of darkness\". More than 80% of victims are male.</p> <p>The Greater Manchester police yesterday offered an alternative explanation of the rise in street robberies, arguing that it is due in part to a \"displacement effect\" following successful campaigns against burglars and car thieves. The Manchester police think that now more homes are harder to break into because they have window locks and alarms burglars have turned to street robberies.

      "bodyText": "The home secretary, Jack Straw, yesterday promised a new mobile phone \"summit\" in an attempt to prevent the continuing surge in street robberies turning into the government's \"achilles heel\" in the debate on crime in the run-up to the general election. The unveiling by Mr Straw of an \"action plan\" and \"electronic toolkit\" for police and community groups to tackle the problem of robberies and street crime, including the boom sector of mobile phone thefts, is designed to intensify the fight against violent crime, particularly in the five cities, London, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol and Liverpool which account for 75% of street robberies in England and Wales. The home secretary wants to discuss with mobile phone manufacturers ways in which they could adopt a more expensive new \"chip\" which would incapacitate stolen phones and the use of personal identification numbers for the newly popular pre-paid \"pay as you go\" phones, which have no registered owner and cannot be cut off the network. Mr Straw's sudden interest yesterday in tackling the problem of street robbery may have as much to do with the publication next week of the annual recorded crime figures as to his determination to tackle the problem. It is expected that overall the figures - the last to be published before the election - will paint a comfortable picture for the Labour government, with continuing falls in the the big volume offences such as burglary and car thefts. But the exception is likely to be violent crime, and especially robberies involving personal property, which the last set of figures published in July showed had increased by 28% to March last year. If next week's figures show a further rise in street robbery it is likely to become one of the major flashpoints in the election. It also threatens to reopen the highly charged controversy over \"stop and search\" and undermine Downing Street's drive against \"yob culture\" which Tony Blair has already identified as a major theme of Labour's re-election campaign. Mr Straw first raised the problem of mobile phone thefts last July when he also talked of calling in the manufacturers alongside proposing to clamp down on public drunkeness and other \"yob behaviour\". Although violent crime accounts for only 13% of all offences, it is the surge in street robbery and the fear of being attacked by a stranger which most worry the public. The action plan to tackle violent crime published by Mr Straw yesterday points out that while last year's British Crime Survey reported a 21% fall in violent crime between 1995 and 1999, there is still a long way to go to reverse the long-term rise over the past 20 years. He argued that some of the long-term rise in violent crime can be regarded, in part, as good news because it represents increased reporting rates to the police by victims of domestic violence and racial attacks. He also stressed that Home Office criminologists claim that most of the long-term rise has been in what is called \"acquaintance violence\" and that violent attacks by strangers has risen at a much slower rate. The Home Office analysis and \"toolkit\" to tackle robbery published yesterday suggests that while in London the typical robber and victim is a young teenage boy aged 15 to 16 at school-leaving time, outside the capital the typical robber is an older male student aged about 18 to 20, with the largest number of robberies taking place during the \"hours of darkness\". More than 80% of victims are male. The Greater Manchester police yesterday offered an alternative explanation of the rise in street robberies, arguing that it is due in part to a \"displacement effect\" following successful campaigns against burglars and car thieves. The Manchester police think that now more homes are harder to break into because they have window locks and alarms burglars have turned to street robberies. This trend has been helped along by the fact that the rewards from bank and building society cash cards are much greater than simply the cash people carry on them and it is also much easier to get rid of the stolen property. However, Mr Straw said that while there might be some displacement effect, he believed that different street robbery rates in different city neighbourhoods showed that it was possible to tackle the problem. As well as deploying police officers, the \"robbery toolkit\" advocates using closed-circuit television, improved lighting and other environmental measures to make it far harder for the street mugger to operate. It also gives advice to those who are anxious about walking the streets at night such as walking closer to the kerb and against the oncoming traffic so you can be seen, to the police putting up notices in a high-crime area to ensure that people are aware that there is a danger they might be mugged. The plan to renew the battle against street crime failed to impress the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe: \"I am always listening to Jack Straw's announcing new initiatives, whether it is about police numbers or tackling youth crime. The fact is, so far none of them have had any success - indeed the reverse has usually happened.\" She promised that the Conservatives would employ more police officers and send more people to jail and when challenged to explain how these measures would be paid for said she would cut the number of Home Office press officers.",

Inevitably, a fight breaks out and punches are thrown. The police, patrolling the area in a marked car, intervene before the fight escalates. Back-up officers arrive in less than a minute. \"If we hadn't been here immediately, then we would have been left to pick up the aftermath of an assault a few minutes later, which would have been much worse,\" says PC Paul Crossley. Manchester is struggling to stem the rise in violent assaults in the city. Between 1997-1999, there was a 225% increase in assaults, which coincided with a 241% rise in the number of licensed premises. Between April 1999 and March last year there were 7,134 robberies of personal property, an increase of 9% from the previous year. Thefts of mobile phones have also increased. A recently introduced bylaw in the city means officers now have the power to remove opened bottles and cans of alcohol from people. Two men with cans of lager are approached by Paul's colleague PC Nikola Jones, 26, and they reluctantly put the drinks in the bin. PC Crossley, 35, says: \"I believe that some of the lads who come out in the city centre do not think they have had a good night unless they have been involved in a fight.\" Friday and Saturday nights are the busiest, but Thursday is also busy as it is student night. Many mobile phones and purses are stolen after being left behind in bars by intoxicated students visiting the toilet. PC Jones says most of the people who create trouble are young men in their late teens or early to mid-20s. She has been assaulted twice. Six hours into their shift, they had removed four cans of alcohol, arrested a violent drunk causing trouble on a bus, attended a burglary, three thefts from pubs or restaurants and been called to the aftermath of another fight. Chief Inspector Garry Shewan, of Bootle Street police station, says the number of violent attacks remained static last year. \"We hope in 2001 that we will be able to stop the rot and that we will see a decrease. Our two priorities are violent assaults and robberies. We must attack the root cause of crime and deal with low-level disorder before it escalates into violence.\" Detective Superintendent Peter Minshall, who is in charge of Operation Hawk, which targets street robbery, said statistically there had been an upward trend in street robbery in 2000, but this had reversed once the initiative was launched last autumn. \"We clearly have a long way to go and are not complacent,\" he says.",

      "bodyText": "The phenomenal pre-Christmas sales of 5m mobile phones, nearly all \"pay as you talk\" models, is clear evidence that many parents thought they were the perfect gift for their teenage children - if only because they wouldn't face any further bills. But it has turned out that this rapid growth in mobile phone culture, particularly among the young, is fuelling a new rise in street robbery. Even before this pre-Christmas sales surge it was estimated by the telecommunications industry that in October 2000, around half the population had a mobile phone and there were already an estimated 34m in circulation. There are not as yet national figures to demonstrate this growth in mobile phone theft but the Metropolitan police have reported a four-fold rise in street crimes involving mobile phones over the last two years. The Greater Manchester police say that in four of their sub-divisions the number of robberies involving mobile phones have risen from 3% to 12% over a similar period. Industry sources estimate that more than 15,000 mobiles are now stolen every month and they expect the number to increase as mobile phone ownership explodes. This increase has taken the police and many others by surprise yet the last British Crime Survey shows that a significant part - possibly as much as one-third - of a 14% rise in street robberies between 1997 and 1999 were down to mobile phone thefts. The same survey showed that many involved children stealing other children's phones in and around school. The police argue that the number of street robberies recorded by them is rising because while in the past an after-school scuffle might have led to somebody's pocket money being stolen or somebody being bullied, it was not reported to the police. Now parents need a police crime number to claim the cost of a new mobile phone from their insurance company so they are usually reported. This, they say, has pushed up the robbery figures. One problem which the home secretary, Jack Straw, said he wants to discuss urgently with mobile phone companies and manufacturers is the fact that 90% of those pre-Christmas sales involve pre-paid \"pay as you talk\" models which have no registered user. Mr Straw wants to set up a \"technical working group\" with the mobile phone industry to crack the problem.

      "body": "<p> The Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago from myriad smaller lumps of rock circuiting the Sun. Initially it was hot, very hot. Over the following 700m years stray projectiles bombarded our planet By 3.8bn years ago, the interplanetary environment had calmed down a little, most of the cosmic detritus having been swept up by the planets. </p> <p>Some of the oldest terrestrial rocks, dating from that era, display fossil evidence of life having existed immediately after the heavy bombardment finished. This is both a puzzle and a significant clue for scientists investigating the origin of life. The point is this. If life - simple microbial life, such as blue/green algae (or cyanobacteria) - blossomed on Earth immediately the bombardment ceased, then maybe the origination of life is \"easy\" in the cosmos. </p> <p>Given the right environmental conditions, perhaps life spontaneously generates. In consequence, extraterrestrial life could be abundant. If it were that easy, maybe there were multiple starts of life on Earth, but the first few were obliterated when massive impacts caused the sterilisation of the planet. </p> <p>Until recently, this was a common idea. But then it was realised that life on Earth is stranger than we had imagined. Far from being killed, bacterial strains have been identified that do better at high temperatures. Textbooks mostly divide life forms into two domains: the prokaryotes and the eukaryotes. Prokaryotes (bacteria and some other single-celled organisms) have no distinct nucleus. Eukaryotes are mostly multi-cellular, and they have nuclei within their cells where the genetic material is stored. All plants and animals are eukaryotes. </p> <p>In recent years microbiologists have recognised an additional domain, called the archaea. The archaeons have no cellular nucleus, but their genes act in similar ways to those of eukaryotes. The first archaeons were recognised in 1977 but - as is usual for any revolution in science - their acceptance has been slow. </p> <p>Archaeons were not discovered earlier because they live in extreme environments, and so are termed extremophiles.

      "bodyText": "The Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago from myriad smaller lumps of rock circuiting the Sun. Initially it was hot, very hot. Over the following 700m years stray projectiles bombarded our planet By 3.8bn years ago, the interplanetary environment had calmed down a little, most of the cosmic detritus having been swept up by the planets. Some of the oldest terrestrial rocks, dating from that era, display fossil evidence of life having existed immediately after the heavy bombardment finished. This is both a puzzle and a significant clue for scientists investigating the origin of life. The point is this. If life - simple microbial life, such as blue/green algae (or cyanobacteria) - blossomed on Earth immediately the bombardment ceased, then maybe the origination of life is \"easy\" in the cosmos. Given the right environmental conditions, perhaps life spontaneously generates. In consequence, extraterrestrial life could be abundant. If it were that easy, maybe there were multiple starts of life on Earth, but the first few were obliterated when massive impacts caused the sterilisation of the planet. Until recently, this was a common idea. But then it was realised that life on Earth is stranger than we had imagined. Far from being killed, bacterial strains have been identified that do better at high temperatures. Textbooks mostly divide life forms into two domains: the prokaryotes and the eukaryotes. Prokaryotes (bacteria and some other single-celled organisms) have no distinct nucleus. Eukaryotes are mostly multi-cellular, and they have nuclei within their cells where the genetic material is stored. All plants and animals are eukaryotes. In recent years microbiologists have recognised an additional domain, called the archaea. The archaeons have no cellular nucleus, but their genes act in similar ways to those of eukaryotes. The first archaeons were recognised in 1977 but - as is usual for any revolution in science - their acceptance has been slow. Archaeons were not discovered earlier because they live in extreme environments, and so are termed extremophiles. More than 500 discrete types of archaeon have been described, but there may be a million more awaiting our perusal, in their peculiar habitats.

One of the most fervent advocates of ethnic cleansing, she was briefly courted by western governments in the mid-1990s when she broke with her colleagues, Radovan Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic. Yesterday she became the first woman publicly indicted by the tribunal and the second key figure from the former Bosnian Serb leadership to come to the Hague. Her surrender is a major coup for prosecutors as they close the net on more powerful figures up the Bosnian Serb chain of command. During the 1992-95 Bosnian war Mrs Plavsic was deputy to the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Karadzic. She took over from him when he was forced from office in 1996. Mr Karadzic and the Bosnian Serb military commander Gen Mladic are the top Bosnian Serb indicted by the tribunal and yesterday the war crimes tribunal's chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, urged them to follow Mrs Plavsic's example. The 70-year-old former biology professor learned she was wanted and began negotiations with United Nations prosecutors a month ago. Her indictment was approved by the court last April, but was kept secret until yesterday. Her lawyer Krstan Simic said his client was in good health. \"She is a brave, strong woman.

      "body": "<p> The free lunch is finally over: Britain's 18-month long free internet bonanza is finally coming to an end. Most users could be picking up the tab for their surfing by the end of the year.</p> <p> The message, coming from industry experts and the ISPs (internet service providers) themselves, might come as a surprise. If you have not been following the City pages, you could be forgiven for thinking that Britain's ISPs are in good health. Everywhere you turn, from the smallest corner shop to the biggest supermarket, there are offers of free internet access, usually with low-cost calls and free web space and often with software to surf the web safely. </p> <p> But, even for the biggest players in the internet access game, the rules are changing. The two business models that support most ISPs are now seen as badly flawed - even before the ill effects of the dot.com downturn are taken into account. The most recent, and high-profile, ISP failures have centred on unmetered internet access. Breathe.com called in the receivers in December, shortly after suspending its offer of unlimited internet access for life, for a one-off payment of \u00a350. </p> <p>The company was thought to have signed up 50,000 users in the nine months the service ran but, despite collecting \u00a32.5 million from them, did not have enough cash to continue. Earlier, AltaVista confessed that it had not connected any of the thousands who had applied for its unmetered service - despite claiming it had 100,000 users. The cost would simply have been too high. The problem for these ISPs, and others peddling unmetered internet access, was simple: they were offering the online equivalent of as many free lunches as you can eat. The ISPs found that UK users have a voracious appetite for the internet - and that BT, which controls the local network, had no intention of offering them a wholesale flat rate deal. </p> <p>Without that, the ISPs were still being charged by the minute by BT, while having only a low, fixed income from users. All that is about to change. AOL has led a campaign to persuade Oftel, the telecoms watchdog, to force BT to offer unmetered wholesale packages to ISPs. </p> <p>After months of lobbying, a new system called Friaco (Flat Rate Internet Call Origination) is in place, and it means ISPs know, for the first time, their telecoms costs will be fixed. AOL has already launched a \u00a315 a month deal that gives 24-hour unmetered net access, and other ISPs are beginning to roll out rival packages. </p> <p>Matt Peacock, director of corporate communications for AOL in the UK, says market research that AOL conducted in February 1999 pointed to massive unfulfilled demand for unmetered internet access. \"We wanted to find out why mass-market internet penetration was not happening in this country,\" he says. </p> <p>\"We didn't understand why, because market conditions in the UK are very similar to the US - a literate and, in global terms, affluent population with high credit card penetration and a willingness to adopt new technology fairly quickly. \"Yet internet penetration was much, much lower than in the US. It still is. More importantly, of those online their usage was hugely lower. Usage was a quarter of that in the US, and without usage you don't have a medium. </p> <p>\"Our research led us to the immediate conclusion that what was needed was flat rate_ if you get rid of the fear of the phone bill, if you kill off those big fat 25-page phone bills from BT full of 0845 numbers.\" Oftel's backing for Friaco could have a major impact on the way the UK uses the net, adds Peacock. He says that AOL users in the UK now behave in a very similar way to their US cousins - in stark contrast to when they were paying by the minute. Within three days of the deal being launched, he says, UK users of AOL were using the service as much as their US cousins, for just over an hour a day on average. And one of the most important factors for AOL is that many of the users are \"newbies\" - first time users of the internet.</p> <p> \"The unlimited plan has seen the fastest uptake of any AOL plan in history, certainly in Europe. We are experiencing record growth. And a lot of these are new users; they are new to the medium, and coming because of flat rate. This is true mass market.\" But why have we not all signed up to free ISPs? It seems we are wary of 'free' ISPs that offer free internet calls but which, too often, have resulted in poor service, high help line charges and complex membership conditions - such as the need to change telephone company.</p> <p> Some industry figures reckon this consumer caution, coupled with the opportunity to wave goodbye to high internet phone bills, could mean that subscription-based unlimited connections will become the most popular method of accessing the internet within a year. Alan Randall, sales and marketing director of independent ISP Supanet, says his company has been preparing for the return of subscription-based services since the middle of last year. </p> <p>\"We've been testing a number of packages over the last six months or so, in terms of subscription-based, unmetered, unlimited access, and we will launch some new packages in the near future,\" he says. \"You will see different types of user emerge. There are going to be lots of similarities with the mobile phone market, in that people will fall into categories. You will end up with three core products - free access, unmetered, and DSL (broadband) and there will probably be one or two customised packages falling in the middle.\"</p> <p> Subscription-based ISPs are not new, of course. One of Britain's oldest ISPs, Demon Internet, started out with a \"tenner a month\" service with local-call charges, which it still provides today. And, predicts Randall, there will be a move back to subscription services. </p> <p>\"We all know nothing is free - why would anybody provide free telephone lines for the internet and not for speech, after all?\" he asks. With the market moving back towards monthly charges, the rash of free ISPs which sprang up in the wake of Freeserve's launch in 1998 will have to change their tactics, or battle it out with many others for those remaining internet users who do not use their connection enough to justify a subscription fee for unlimited use, or broadband.

Other ISPs have already moved to get out of the ISP business altogether, and have 'gone niche' by concentrating on their web content.

E-commerce and advertising revenues - on which some free ISPs pin their hopes - are unlikely to be huge when they are catering for infrequent, pay-per-minute surfers. And even if they did get a slice of the pie, the total online advertising market in Europe is thought to only be worth around \u00a3630m.

No one has put it more bluntly than Nick Backhouse, the finance director of Freeserve, when he was presenting the company's last set of quarterly results in December. \"Eighteen months ago, people were asking whether we were going to buy any of the 300 ISPs in the market, but we answered that we could acquire users cheaper through organic growth,\" he said. \"Those ISPs are now being condensed to four.\" </p> <p><strong> Three flavours of net access</strong></p> <p> <strong> The power user: unmetered broadband</strong> </p> <p>Technically adept, and experienced with the internet, these users will be willing to pay around \u00a340 a month for high-speed access to the net, initially running at around 10 times the speed of today's fastest dial-up modems.

      "bodyText": "The free lunch is finally over: Britain's 18-month long free internet bonanza is finally coming to an end. Most users could be picking up the tab for their surfing by the end of the year. The message, coming from industry experts and the ISPs (internet service providers) themselves, might come as a surprise. If you have not been following the City pages, you could be forgiven for thinking that Britain's ISPs are in good health. Everywhere you turn, from the smallest corner shop to the biggest supermarket, there are offers of free internet access, usually with low-cost calls and free web space and often with software to surf the web safely. But, even for the biggest players in the internet access game, the rules are changing. The two business models that support most ISPs are now seen as badly flawed - even before the ill effects of the dot.com downturn are taken into account. The most recent, and high-profile, ISP failures have centred on unmetered internet access. Breathe.com called in the receivers in December, shortly after suspending its offer of unlimited internet access for life, for a one-off payment of \u00a350. The company was thought to have signed up 50,000 users in the nine months the service ran but, despite collecting \u00a32.5 million from them, did not have enough cash to continue. Earlier, AltaVista confessed that it had not connected any of the thousands who had applied for its unmetered service - despite claiming it had 100,000 users. The cost would simply have been too high. The problem for these ISPs, and others peddling unmetered internet access, was simple: they were offering the online equivalent of as many free lunches as you can eat. The ISPs found that UK users have a voracious appetite for the internet - and that BT, which controls the local network, had no intention of offering them a wholesale flat rate deal. Without that, the ISPs were still being charged by the minute by BT, while having only a low, fixed income from users. All that is about to change. AOL has led a campaign to persuade Oftel, the telecoms watchdog, to force BT to offer unmetered wholesale packages to ISPs. After months of lobbying, a new system called Friaco (Flat Rate Internet Call Origination) is in place, and it means ISPs know, for the first time, their telecoms costs will be fixed. AOL has already launched a \u00a315 a month deal that gives 24-hour unmetered net access, and other ISPs are beginning to roll out rival packages. Matt Peacock, director of corporate communications for AOL in the UK, says market research that AOL conducted in February 1999 pointed to massive unfulfilled demand for unmetered internet access. \"We wanted to find out why mass-market internet penetration was not happening in this country,\" he says. \"We didn't understand why, because market conditions in the UK are very similar to the US - a literate and, in global terms, affluent population with high credit card penetration and a willingness to adopt new technology fairly quickly. \"Yet internet penetration was much, much lower than in the US. It still is. More importantly, of those online their usage was hugely lower. Usage was a quarter of that in the US, and without usage you don't have a medium. \"Our research led us to the immediate conclusion that what was needed was flat rate_ if you get rid of the fear of the phone bill, if you kill off those big fat 25-page phone bills from BT full of 0845 numbers.\" Oftel's backing for Friaco could have a major impact on the way the UK uses the net, adds Peacock. He says that AOL users in the UK now behave in a very similar way to their US cousins - in stark contrast to when they were paying by the minute. Within three days of the deal being launched, he says, UK users of AOL were using the service as much as their US cousins, for just over an hour a day on average. And one of the most important factors for AOL is that many of the users are \"newbies\" - first time users of the internet. \"The unlimited plan has seen the fastest uptake of any AOL plan in history, certainly in Europe. We are experiencing record growth. And a lot of these are new users; they are new to the medium, and coming because of flat rate. This is true mass market.\" But why have we not all signed up to free ISPs? It seems we are wary of 'free' ISPs that offer free internet calls but which, too often, have resulted in poor service, high help line charges and complex membership conditions - such as the need to change telephone company. Some industry figures reckon this consumer caution, coupled with the opportunity to wave goodbye to high internet phone bills, could mean that subscription-based unlimited connections will become the most popular method of accessing the internet within a year. Alan Randall, sales and marketing director of independent ISP Supanet, says his company has been preparing for the return of subscription-based services since the middle of last year. \"We've been testing a number of packages over the last six months or so, in terms of subscription-based, unmetered, unlimited access, and we will launch some new packages in the near future,\" he says. \"You will see different types of user emerge. There are going to be lots of similarities with the mobile phone market, in that people will fall into categories. You will end up with three core products - free access, unmetered, and DSL (broadband) and there will probably be one or two customised packages falling in the middle.\" Subscription-based ISPs are not new, of course. One of Britain's oldest ISPs, Demon Internet, started out with a \"tenner a month\" service with local-call charges, which it still provides today. And, predicts Randall, there will be a move back to subscription services. \"We all know nothing is free - why would anybody provide free telephone lines for the internet and not for speech, after all?\" he asks. With the market moving back towards monthly charges, the rash of free ISPs which sprang up in the wake of Freeserve's launch in 1998 will have to change their tactics, or battle it out with many others for those remaining internet users who do not use their connection enough to justify a subscription fee for unlimited use, or broadband. And there are doubts about how lucrative a market these reluctant surfers will be. Free ISPs today rely on a cut of telephone charges, but across Europe those charges have fallen by as much as 50% in the past two years, and are likely to fall further as former state monopolies - including BT and Deutsche Telekom, of Germany - have their grips loosened by regulators. For that reason, Hellen Omwando, associate analyst at research company Forrester, says that all free ISPs are now realising their business models are \"unsustainable\". \"A lot of them, as a result, are moving into the portals business,\" says Omwando. \"By doing this they are providing gateways for consumers to access content_ they are looking to make money from advertising.\" For those who are looking to remain in the ISP business, there are the possibilities of providing broadband connections - faster links to the internet that will almost certainly be paid for by subscription fees. \"Broadband is certainly a technology which will offer some differentiation between portals,\" says Omwando. \"The problem is ISPs may not even have the money to invest in broadband networks. \"The best recourse for some ISPs is to get bought out by a strong portal player - one which started out as purely a portal and has strong advertising revenue - or to get bought out by a telco [telecoms company] which is looking to gain access to consumers. \"Another option is to go niche - to focus on a particular content category or audience segment, because you cannot compete with the big players.\" The consolidation Omwando talks of has already begun: Freeserve's \u00a31.6bn sale to Wanadoo, of France, and the expected auction sale of LineOne to a foreign bidder is proof of that. Other ISPs have already moved to get out of the ISP business altogether, and have 'gone niche' by concentrating on their web content. Virgin.net is in the process of demerging its 600,000 member-strong ISP business to cable operator NTL, while its portal relaunches and focuses on entertainment, leisure content and e-commerce. Meanwhile Bluecarrots, which launched in autumn 1999, stopped promoting its ISP after only three months to concentrate on creating a buying community, giving its users free shares and cashback on transactions they make with partner e-commerce firms through the site. \"We're moving towards a portal approach,\" says Steve Masters, online director of Bluecarrots. \"We're trying to distance ourselves from being a dial-up service because we felt we could do a much better business if we dealt with anyone online, regardless of where they dial in. \"We were never going to compete or survive in the long term if we only gave membership to people who dialled into us, because there are so many ISPs out there. Just getting someone to come to your website is a different matter altogether.\" But, while Bluecarrots has moved to get out of the ISP business early, shifts to the portal and content businesses are unlikely to save all those free ISPs who do not upgrade to subscription models. E-commerce and advertising revenues - on which some free ISPs pin their hopes - are unlikely to be huge when they are catering for infrequent, pay-per-minute surfers. And even if they did get a slice of the pie, the total online advertising market in Europe is thought to only be worth around \u00a3630m.

Explaining his decision to go, Mr Funke had told reporters that he wanted to \"clear the way for a new beginning\". Whether Germany gets one, though, will depend on two factors: Ms K\u00fcnast's readiness to take unpopular measures and the chancellor's readiness to stand by her if she does. As the outgoing health minister, Andrea Fischer, herself a Green, observed at her farewell press conference, the German consumer is reluctant to pay the prices that organic farming needs to charge to be profitable. Ms K\u00fcnast was careful yesterday not to give any hostages to fortune. \"Over the next few months, we must identify all the things that have been done wrong in recent years, and systematically develop concepts for what should be done differently,\" she said. In the meantime, Ms K\u00fcnast will be under heavy pressure from farmers to alleviate their plight. Beef sales have dropped by more than half since the discovery last November that BSE had entered German herds. A lawyer by training, the 45-year-old Ms K\u00fcnast has a reputation for humour, hard work and quotable repartee. In a typical quip, she yesterday noted that by putting her in charge of consumer affairs, Mr Schr\u00f6der had landed her with \"everything from egg-boilers to e-commerce\". Like many of her generation, she entered Green politics as a protester against nuclear waste. Though born near Wuppertal in then West Germany, she has lived in Berlin since the 1970s and in 1985 became a city councillor. She is regarded within the Green movement as a moderate. Last June, she was elected, together with Fritz Kuhn, to be the party's overall leader. One of the two ministerial portfolios up for grabs had been expected to go to North Rhine-Westphalia's environment minister, B\u00e4rbel H\u00f6hn. Ms H\u00f6hn is best known as a vociferous opponent of the decision last year to lift the EU ban on the export of British beef. In the end, Mr Schr\u00f6der decided that Ms K\u00fcnast was the bigger hitter for what, from now on, will be a key post. The health ministry went to Ulla Schmidt, a deputy leader of the Social Democrat group in parliament.",

      "body": "<p>A few months back, I was flat on my back coming round from an anaesthetic in a south London hospital, which, with its peeling paint and echoing lift-wells, had the air of something from the Stalinist era in a poor area of Moscow. To pass the time, I thought I would look around for what evidence I could find of the revolution in clinical IT that has, I am told, happened in the past decade. I was in the same hospital eight years ago, and wrote down my impressions of their computer systems. (Computer Guardian, 30 July 1992). Had things changed in the eight long years since then? No, emphatically no. </p> <p>Eight years ago, I took a dislike to the big trolley carrying the folders of patients' records, the central altarpiece of that relic of Victorian pageantry, the consultant's ward round. I dreamed of a future where the consultant would sit informally at the end of my bed with an Apple Newton or other pen-pad, and bring up my x-rays and ultra-sound scans from my electronic patient-record deep in the hospital's database. </p> <p>In a response to my Guardian article, a health authority in the Midlands wrote to ask where it would find the money to pay for all this. A paediatric consultant asked in a aggrieved way how hospital staff would find the time to plan, train for, and implement such a system. He was much too busy. A cancer consultant recently relocated to Boston, Mass, said his hospital had all I suggested already. A computer manufacturer, Hewlett Packard, sent me a video of the hospital-of- the-future with everything that I dreamed of, with one or two extras, such as doctors talking directly to computers, and smart cards being used for medical records worldwide. It claimed that the technology was already or nearly available. </p> <p>On my recent visit to the hospital, I saw nothing of this brave new technology. Not much had changed in the eight long years. A computer had arrived in the nurses' room, which they seemed to use for admissions, ordering drugs from the pharmacy and for recording some tests on a patients' database. This was more than can be said for the consultants' offices and consulting rooms in outpatients, which appeared to be computer-free zones. The trolley full of folders still made its triumphal appearance on some consultants' ward rounds. My folder was about two inches thick. Although I did have suspicions that there was a rudimentary electronic patient record somewhere in the hospital, path-lab reports, doctors' notes, memos between hospital doctors and referral letters were printed out. It was clear that the paper folder on the trolley was still the master record. </p> <p>The defects of such a paper-based system came home to me when I noticed on my first evening that the results of a radio-isotope scan done about a week before my admission was not in my file. I, the patient - albeit that most irritating of breeds, an articulate, stroppy, white middle-class patient - had to point out its absence. It was found quite quickly, but at MY prompting. On the result of this scan depended whether they would do the op. So, it was quite important. Would they have found it if I had not been articulate, white and stroppy? </p> <p>At my routine follow-up with my GP after my operation, I asked him how he had received the hospital's report on my op: snail mail or email? Snail mail of course, and he launched an attack on all the hospital trusts in our area. Whereas he, working with other like-minded GP practices in the area, had almost achieved a paperless surgery for his internal patient records, he still had to cope with a flood of paper from local hospitals. He showed me my patient record, only three pages of internal paper, but as much as half an inch of path reports and hospital reports coming from outside. </p> <p>He grumbled that either the hospitals had not thought of communicating electronically with him, or they set up systems to suit their own requirements, with no regard for the needs of the area's GPs. Nor indeed are the hospitals compatible with each other. This lumbers the poor GP with several different bits of software to handle those hospitals which do want to communicate electronically with him. Remember that hospitals have expensive IT departments full of IT 'experts'. GPs don't. They're just doctors. And yet, they have succeeded in offloading their administrative and clinical chores to the computer. The hospitals haven't. </p> <p>When I asked my GP to explain why this might be, the first word he used was arrogance. Each hospital wants to follow its own agenda. So, the hospital trusts develop their computer systems in isolation, reinventing the wheel as they go along. According to my GP, the hospital cannot see the needs of the patient as a whole. Only the GP can do that. And only he can look at what the NHS as a whole has to offer - or fails to offer - and plays the necessary games for the benefit of the patient. To do this effectively, he recognises that all GPs have to develop common systems, and use common software standards and packages. He admits that they haven't got there yet, but they are on the way. </p> <p>What my GP said about arrogance reminded me of a visit I paid with a group of MPs to a teaching hospital two and a half years ago. They showed us a marvellous patient administration system and a cardiothoracic imaging database, and were looking hard at palm-tops on the ward and voice-recognition and many of the other things I had dreamed of eight years ago. They also had admirable ideas about a \"continuum of patient care\" from primary care (GPs), through secondary care (general hospitals) to tertiary care (teaching hospitals). </p> <p>But, when the parliamentarians asked whether there was any mechanism to replicate such \"golden examples\" elsewhere, so that the whole NHS benefits, they got a very sharp reply. National standards would inhibit the developers of advanced systems, and general hospitals are so far behind, particularly on their network infrastructure, that \"we would be held up waiting for them to implement what we are doing. Besides, our advanced sys tems that our consultants have developed are the responsibility of those consultants. We are happy to show people what we are doing, but that's as far as we will go. And, when we get help for an advanced system, we go to the research councils, not the NHS.\" </p> <p>With these attitudes from a centre of excellence, it is no wonder that my local general hospital has not got very far in eight years. </p> <p>Then there is the political dimension. After the parliamentary visit, an ex-Secretary of State for Wales told me that he had built up a structure in Wales to encourage hospitals to replicate their successes. But then \"John Redwood came along and tore it all down, because he expected hospitals to compete not cooperate in the internal health market.\" Thus, political dogma, added to the natural arrogance shown by the various tiers in the health service, did not exactly help progress for most of the eight years between my operations. </p> <p>Another inhibitor to progress is the NHS itself. Last year, I was amazed to find that it gave no central guidance on the millennium bug, so that each hospital trust had to research the problem itself, and devise its own plan. The wheel had to be reinvented hundreds of times throughout the NHS. No wonder money ran short last winter. </p> <p>There is another tendency in the health service that stops progress. It funds a pilot in one hospital for, say, research into tele-medicine in dermatology. The research is done, benefits and savings are identified, but no mechanisms are put in place to generalise the technology across the NHS. The money runs out, the research report is filed, and the project dies. One researcher, who is engaged in such a tele- medicine project, calls such pilots \"Ozymandian corpses\", which litter the sand of the NHS desert. She admits that restricting her initiative to dermatology is a waste of money on its own, and would like to widen her pilot into other disciplines such as ophthamology. But finding money for cross-disciplinary research is almost impossible. </p> <p>It is difficult to see how, in the present NHS mode, she can stop her project becoming just another trunkless leg of stone. </p> <p>Perhaps most damning is the history of the NHSNet. It was installed almost 10 years ago, but then the NHS failed to show the health community how to use it or even why to use it. And the professional bodies sneered at its lack of security. Today, after five years of hesitating and messing around, only about 50%of GPs are connected. </p> <p>All this is against a backdrop of the internet and world wide web, where far-sighted standards-makers have ensured that all industries and all people have been able to talk to each other across the world for almost any purpose for the past 10 years. That is the measure of the failure of NHSNet. </p> <p>An NHS Information Authority was set up as late as April 1999, to impose some standards in this Tower of Babel. It hopes to get all GPs connected by 2002, but does not plan to implement a working electronic health record until 2005. There is also a target for implementing telemedicine by 2004. Hardly challenging! </p> <p>Setting targets from the centre is one thing, persuading the hospital trusts to make them happen in the fragmented culture of today's NHS is another. I asked a niece who is a hospital administrator whether there was any hope of speeding things up. She said: \"The trouble is that the questions you are asking are too big. There is nobody with a wide enough view to answer you.\" I fear that in the meantime all the lovely new NHS money granted by kind Gordon Brown will just be spent by small people with narrow vision reinventing wheels. </p> <p>No wonder I saw so little progress from my hospital bed. As a taxpayer and ageing patient, becoming year by year more dependent on the NHS, I object. I am not asking for top-down NHS diktats, just for hospital trusts to talk to each other, and for the NHS Information Authority to be given more teeth. </p> <p>Then perhaps the hospitals will learn to use standards, and even replicate their better systems. And perhaps, on my next visit to hospital, I will see on the ward the technology which was available way back in 1992.</p>",

If you look at the BBC, every programme has a website and every website has content that the Beeb will never have time to broadcast.\" </p> <p>Jason Thomson at NMR, which offers streaming media consultancy, installation and support services for companies like Abbey Road Interactive and Channel 4, stresses the importance of designing projects with the web in mind: \"It's important not to have too much movement or too much information to convey. One has to balance up something that is poor quality but with compelling content against something that is specially designed. People will look at amateur footage of the Kennedy assassination but for extended viewing one needs to go for quality.\" </p> <p>Thomson points out that, ironically, people are shooting on high quality broadcast cameras rather than camcorders in order to get the best possible quality for the web. </p> <p>Where is the technology now? It isn't yet fully mature. Despite rapid innovation, it can still be a frustrating experience. Occasionally it is necessary to download the latest players, mostly free, but still time-consuming. </p> <p>Broadband links are subject to net congestion just like the lowly 56kbps modem. Picture quality even at the highest resolution can be decidedly uneven. </p> <p>Some of the most interesting things are happening on radio where, because the audio signal takes up such a small amount of bandwidth, quality can be high and net congestion is far less of a problem. Internet stations like <a href=\"http://www.puremix.com\" target=\"_new\">www.puremix.com</a> are starting to offer personalised selections for individual listeners. </p> <p>But every so often the medium takes off and there is something on the screen which is genuinely gripping, whether it is a live webcast like the Madonna gig, a news item from BBC or finding out yet more information on Channel 4's Big Brother residents. Currently the three tenors are putting on a tremendous concert on <a href=\"http://www.msn.co.uk/page/11-588.asp\">www.msn.co.uk/page/11-588.asp </a>. </p> <p> And for the future, in Frampton's words, \"For live events, the delivery of the future will be cable, ADSL and satellite.

The market for the future will be the ability of internet broadcasters to satisfy the demands of niche audiences - whether these are followers of fishing, cooking, exhibitions or snowboarding!\" According to Frampton, \"the outstanding benefit of the technology we will be using in the future, which, for now, we can call the internet, is that it completely frees the broadcaster from the time constraints and demands of scheduling multi-interest programming on a very limited number of channels. If you look at the BBC, every programme has a website and every website has content that the Beeb will never have time to broadcast.\" Jason Thomson at NMR, which offers streaming media consultancy, installation and support services for companies like Abbey Road Interactive and Channel 4, stresses the importance of designing projects with the web in mind: \"It's important not to have too much movement or too much information to convey. One has to balance up something that is poor quality but with compelling content against something that is specially designed. People will look at amateur footage of the Kennedy assassination but for extended viewing one needs to go for quality.\" Thomson points out that, ironically, people are shooting on high quality broadcast cameras rather than camcorders in order to get the best possible quality for the web. Where is the technology now? It isn't yet fully mature. Despite rapid innovation, it can still be a frustrating experience. Occasionally it is necessary to download the latest players, mostly free, but still time-consuming. Broadband links are subject to net congestion just like the lowly 56kbps modem. Picture quality even at the highest resolution can be decidedly uneven. Some of the most interesting things are happening on radio where, because the audio signal takes up such a small amount of bandwidth, quality can be high and net congestion is far less of a problem. Internet stations like www.puremix.com are starting to offer personalised selections for individual listeners. But every so often the medium takes off and there is something on the screen which is genuinely gripping, whether it is a live webcast like the Madonna gig, a news item from BBC or finding out yet more information on Channel 4's Big Brother residents. Currently the three tenors are putting on a tremendous concert on www.msn.co.uk/page/11-588.asp . And for the future, in Frampton's words, \"For live events, the delivery of the future will be cable, ADSL and satellite. And the potential is vast - unlimited.\"",

But rather than being locked up in some make-shift house in East London, they're bundled off to various locations across France and Jersey and set a range of tasks to complete. </p> <p>Each challenge successfully executed (and these can be anything from bungee jumping to dying their hair orange, parachuting or posing nude for a painting) results in money being paid into a kitty, which is eventually pocketed by the overall winner. </p> <p>Interestingly, however, the winner isn't the person who completes the most tasks. He or she is the one who comes closest to identifying the Mole, a sort of Nasty Nick mystery character cunningly disguised as one of the 10 contestants, and whose mission is to stop the group winning any cash by sabotaging all their endeavours. </p> <p>Peter Davey, series producer, comments: \"The Mole's appeal is that it's popular and populist and very engaging. It's almost impossible not to play the game. Everyone will have a different opinion about who the Mole is. It's like 'Who shot JR?'\" </p> <p>At the end of each hour-long weekly episode, the contestant who has sussed out the least information about the Mole is flown home, until the final show in which the Mole is revealed, and then the one closest to identifying the Mole claims victory. That will mean prize money worth anything up to \u00a3200,000 - a chunky improvement on Big Brother's \u00a370,000 pot. </p> <p>Taking part are a similarly motley crew to the Channel 4 tribe, although efforts have been made to avoid recruiting too many stridently aspiring TV presenters. Among them are Oliver, a fresh-faced 22-year-old trainee lawyer from Glasgow; Paul, a cute 35-year-old religious studies teacher from Bognor Regis; and Jo-anna (sic), an artist/designer from the Isle of Wight, with over-blonde hair and Caroline-style lip-liner. </p> <p>The presenter is Glenn Hugill, last seen three years ago in Coronation Street as a bent Geordie copper, who was dramatically dumped at the altar by Fiona Middleton. Crucially, however, throughout the three-week shoot he had no idea (and still doesn't) who the Mole was. Nor did the director or any of the crew. Nor did Alan Nixon, the Channel 5 commissioning editor, or Dawn Airey, the channel's chief executive, who has been spotted trying to bribe crew members to spill the beans. </p> <p>\"Only me, the Mole and one other person knows,\" says Davey gleefully. \"The crew would have told one another. It would have been too good a secret to keep. And to this day, not even the Mole's family knows, so someone is in for a big surprise.\" </p> <p>The entire series of nine shows has been edited in the strictest secrecy, and the final unmasking programme hasn't even been made yet: it's to be delivered 30 minutes before transmission in early March, probably on foot by Davey himself, who was armed with all forms of secret cameras on the shoot to secure footage of the mole at work. </p> <p>Channel 5 is obviously confident that after factual soaps, reality game-shows are the Next Big Thing - the entertainment department is apparently spending more on this than on any other show to date. </p> <p>Nixon comments: \"It's expensive because it's filmed entirely on location, and involves numerous death-defying stunts, planes, speedboats and jeeps. We've invested in it because I saw the Australian version and was totally hooked. The fact that it won at Montreux sealed it for us too.\" </p> <p>The feel is certainly rather more lavish than we've come to expect from Channel 5, and therein possibly lies a problem. Will people tune in? Davey concedes that the show is \"up against it\", being broadcast by the nation's least-watched terrestrial channel, but he stresses that they have \"thrown money at it\" and are promoting it with vigour. </p> <p>Being transmitted weekly rather than nightly (as with Big Brother) could also reduce its appeal, but its special blend of high production values and Cluedo-style mystery just might make it Appointment Television, and attract audiences Channel 5 has hitherto only dreamed of. And surely, if Mel tweaking her bikini line and Darren endlessly opening and shutting cupboard doors can grip the nation, The Mole must stand some kind of chance. </p> <p>\u0095 The Mole, tomorrow, 8pm, Channel 5.</p>",

He or she is the one who comes closest to identifying the Mole, a sort of Nasty Nick mystery character cunningly disguised as one of the 10 contestants, and whose mission is to stop the group winning any cash by sabotaging all their endeavours. Peter Davey, series producer, comments: \"The Mole's appeal is that it's popular and populist and very engaging. It's almost impossible not to play the game. Everyone will have a different opinion about who the Mole is. It's like 'Who shot JR?'\" At the end of each hour-long weekly episode, the contestant who has sussed out the least information about the Mole is flown home, until the final show in which the Mole is revealed, and then the one closest to identifying the Mole claims victory. That will mean prize money worth anything up to \u00a3200,000 - a chunky improvement on Big Brother's \u00a370,000 pot. Taking part are a similarly motley crew to the Channel 4 tribe, although efforts have been made to avoid recruiting too many stridently aspiring TV presenters. Among them are Oliver, a fresh-faced 22-year-old trainee lawyer from Glasgow; Paul, a cute 35-year-old religious studies teacher from Bognor Regis; and Jo-anna (sic), an artist/designer from the Isle of Wight, with over-blonde hair and Caroline-style lip-liner. The presenter is Glenn Hugill, last seen three years ago in Coronation Street as a bent Geordie copper, who was dramatically dumped at the altar by Fiona Middleton. Crucially, however, throughout the three-week shoot he had no idea (and still doesn't) who the Mole was. Nor did the director or any of the crew. Nor did Alan Nixon, the Channel 5 commissioning editor, or Dawn Airey, the channel's chief executive, who has been spotted trying to bribe crew members to spill the beans. \"Only me, the Mole and one other person knows,\" says Davey gleefully. \"The crew would have told one another. It would have been too good a secret to keep. And to this day, not even the Mole's family knows, so someone is in for a big surprise.\" The entire series of nine shows has been edited in the strictest secrecy, and the final unmasking programme hasn't even been made yet: it's to be delivered 30 minutes before transmission in early March, probably on foot by Davey himself, who was armed with all forms of secret cameras on the shoot to secure footage of the mole at work. Channel 5 is obviously confident that after factual soaps, reality game-shows are the Next Big Thing - the entertainment department is apparently spending more on this than on any other show to date. Nixon comments: \"It's expensive because it's filmed entirely on location, and involves numerous death-defying stunts, planes, speedboats and jeeps. We've invested in it because I saw the Australian version and was totally hooked. The fact that it won at Montreux sealed it for us too.\" The feel is certainly rather more lavish than we've come to expect from Channel 5, and therein possibly lies a problem. Will people tune in? Davey concedes that the show is \"up against it\", being broadcast by the nation's least-watched terrestrial channel, but he stresses that they have \"thrown money at it\" and are promoting it with vigour. Being transmitted weekly rather than nightly (as with Big Brother) could also reduce its appeal, but its special blend of high production values and Cluedo-style mystery just might make it Appointment Television, and attract audiences Channel 5 has hitherto only dreamed of. And surely, if Mel tweaking her bikini line and Darren endlessly opening and shutting cupboard doors can grip the nation, The Mole must stand some kind of chance. \u0095 The Mole, tomorrow, 8pm, Channel 5.",

As with much else concerning the new cabinet, Dick Cheney's pragmatic hand is discernible here. The vice-president-designate and White House godfather was clearly not going to let Ms Chavez's domestic arrangements disrupt his tightly-run transition or detract from his greenhorn ward's inauguration.</p> <p>While the Chavez row was unforeseen, the same cannot be said of the controversy attending several other Bush picks. Donald Rumsfeld, Gerald Ford's Penta gon hatchetman, has been offered a re-run as defence secretary. A powerful personality who once famously scuppered the Salt II accord with the Soviet Union and bloodied Henry Kissinger's nose, Mr Rumsfeld has already attracted hostile fire over an allegedly racist conversation with Richard Nixon. Mr Bush's emphasis on bigger, better defence, especially missiles, renders the hardline Rumsfeld-Cheney axis formidable. It also presages a classic Washington power struggle with Gen Powell, backed perhaps by national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, that will test Mr Bush's leadership skills.</p> <p>Gale Norton, chosen as interior secretary, faces congressional opposition for her laissez-faire approach to environmental protection. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the notorious James Watt, Ronald Reagan's appointee in the post, Ms Norton's support for new oil drilling in Alaska, her close ties to the \"extractor\" industries, and her handling of a river pollution disaster in Colorado have all stirred up animosity to her nomination. In similar vein, Mr Bush's selection of John Ashcroft, a militant Christian fundamentalist, unyielding opponent of abortion and gay rights, and death penalty supporter, as attorney-general has provoked fierce criticism from black organisations, women's groups and gun controllers. Ms Chavez's early departure from the fray is now expected to intensify the Ashcroft battle.</p> <p>Taken as a whole, the Bush-Cheney cabinet will provide experience that the new president lacks. But for those who believed Mr Bush's talk of \"compassionate conservatism\" and bipartisanship and expected a centrist stance, it must be a big disappointment. It is a preponderantly rightwing line-up that assumes a mandate where none exists and foolishly ignores the deep national faultlines revealed by last November's election.</p>",

Donald Rumsfeld, Gerald Ford's Penta gon hatchetman, has been offered a re-run as defence secretary. A powerful personality who once famously scuppered the Salt II accord with the Soviet Union and bloodied Henry Kissinger's nose, Mr Rumsfeld has already attracted hostile fire over an allegedly racist conversation with Richard Nixon. Mr Bush's emphasis on bigger, better defence, especially missiles, renders the hardline Rumsfeld-Cheney axis formidable. It also presages a classic Washington power struggle with Gen Powell, backed perhaps by national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, that will test Mr Bush's leadership skills. Gale Norton, chosen as interior secretary, faces congressional opposition for her laissez-faire approach to environmental protection. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the notorious James Watt, Ronald Reagan's appointee in the post, Ms Norton's support for new oil drilling in Alaska, her close ties to the \"extractor\" industries, and her handling of a river pollution disaster in Colorado have all stirred up animosity to her nomination. In similar vein, Mr Bush's selection of John Ashcroft, a militant Christian fundamentalist, unyielding opponent of abortion and gay rights, and death penalty supporter, as attorney-general has provoked fierce criticism from black organisations, women's groups and gun controllers. Ms Chavez's early departure from the fray is now expected to intensify the Ashcroft battle. Taken as a whole, the Bush-Cheney cabinet will provide experience that the new president lacks. But for those who believed Mr Bush's talk of \"compassionate conservatism\" and bipartisanship and expected a centrist stance, it must be a big disappointment. It is a preponderantly rightwing line-up that assumes a mandate where none exists and foolishly ignores the deep national faultlines revealed by last November's election.",

It's supposed to be soothing but there was no squeeze,\" she says.</p> <p>Nkosi was infected with HIV at birth. Nkosi's mother, Nonhlanhla Khumalo, left him at a refuge as a baby. She told the staff she could not take care of him because she was scared of her neighbours' reaction.

And he has done it without the help of AZT and other drugs that few black people can afford, until just a few months ago when an American benefactor stepped in.</p> <p>But it is also his status as an \"innocent victim\" - neither judged for his sexuality nor for promiscuity - that has allowed so many people to openly grieve for a boy described by Nelson Mandela yesterday as \"an icon of the struggle for life\".</p> <p>\"Children such as Nkosi Johnson should be enjoying a life filled with joy and laughter and happiness. On a frightening scale HIV/Aids is replacing that joy, laughter and happiness with paralysing pain and trauma,\" said Mandela.</p> <p>Nkosi captured the public eye three years ago when Johnson registered him for a Johannesburg school. As required, she noted on the application form that he was HIV-positive.</p> <p>\"That created havoc because at that stage there was no policy on how to deal with an infected child in the classroom,\" she says. \"I discovered that the school's governing body and the parents had a secret meeting about Nkosi without telling me and they were split fifty-fifty over whether to admit him. I only found out when one of the parents called a reporter and told him what had gone on.\"</p> <p>Nkosi was finally admitted three months later, once all the teachers had attended a workshop on how to deal with HIV-positive children.</p> <p>The case attracted enough public attention to lead to a certain amount of hand wringing about what it meant to have Aids. One of the results was a lessening of the stigma around the disease. Another was a fundraising campaign that gathered enough money for Johnson to launch \"Nkosi's Haven\", a home for women with the virus and their children - some infected, some not.</p> <p>It was after his mother's death, and the episode at the school, that Johnson says Nkosi started to get agitated about Aids.</p> <p>Last July, he addressed the international Aids conference in Durban. Dressed in a suit, standing in the middle of a stage and facing thousands of delegates, the small boy with a tiny voice recounted the misery of losing his mother to Aids and attacked the government for failing to provide drugs to pregnant HIV-positive women.</p> <p>\"I just wish that the government can start giving AZT to pregnant HIV mothers to help stop the virus being passed onto their babies,\" Nkosi said. \"Babies are dying very quickly and I know one little abandoned baby who came to stay with us and his name was Micky. He couldn't breathe, he couldn't eat and he was so sick and my mummy, Gail, had to phone welfare to have him admitted to a hospital and he died. But he was such a cute little baby and I think the government must start doing it because I don't want babies to die.\"</p> <p>The speech shocked and saddened many at the conference. So did Thabo Mbeki who left while Nkosi was still offering his rebuke of the government's neglect of poor black mothers and the president's politicking over Aids. Mbeki's office later said he was pressed for time but critics argued that, at the very least, it was crass to walk out of the hall during the child's brief speech.</p> <p>\"I don't know why he walked out,\" says Johnson. \"They said he had to get to Gabon or somewhere, but they had already made sure that Nkosi didn't speak before the president. Nkosi's speech wasn't very long but the president left in the middle.\"</p> <p>After that came the whispering campaign accusing Johnson of exploiting Nkosi for profit or political ends. She shrugs off the accusation, and there is certainly nothing in the trappings of her chaotic and modest home to hint at wealth.</p> <p>\"I have been accused of exploitation of course, but we don't take money for his speeches. When people want to donate it goes to Nkosi's Haven not to me. To be honest, 99% of the time I have had nothing but people saying, 'Thank you for doing something,' \" she says.</p> <p>Johnson is imposing and formidable. Her face is overdone with thick make-up favoured by middle-class white women in South Africa, and long fake nails that reveal her impatience as she taps them up the side of a glass of cola. She snaps at the burgeoning group of wellwishers to shut up when they get too loud.</p> <p>When Johnson first took Nkosi in she was told he would not survive more than nine months. At first she had little idea how to deal with an HIV-positive child.</p> <p>\"When I first got him I was having him tested (for his blood T-cell count) every month but he just carried on being well and lived his life so I gave up,\" she says.</p> <p>In the absence of money for drugs, Johnson says Nkosi survived on a healthy diet, vitamin supplements and minimising the stress of being HIV positive. She thinks the last element particularly important.</p> <p>\"Nkosi hasn't had to live with the stress of a lie which so many people in this country have to. He has been free with his Aids, so to speak. He doesn't have to lie about why he can't play football. I think that relieved him of a great burden that many other people have,\" she says.</p> <p>Johnson was divorced four years ago. Friends say she was forced to choose between Nkosi and her marriage. She hints that she was alone in her dedication to the child when asked if she could have afforded anti-Aids drugs for him. \"Because I forced Nkosi onto this family, I couldn't ask my husband to carry the cost. That wouldn't be fair,\" she says.</p> <p>Last year, Nkosi was invited to America to talk at another conference. It was there that he was for the first time offered the drugs his family could not afford. But that was just seven months ago and they were of limited benefit; he was already succumbing to the disease.</p> <p>Almost to the last, Nkosi attended the school that had once tried to reject him. He did not do particularly well academically. Johnson puts that down to the kindness of the teachers.</p> <p>\"He was not too good, but I found out this year that he was hardly in class. He spent most of his time with the headmaster eating pizzas,\" she says.</p> <p>Nkosi attempts a smile when someone arrives with a message from his schoolmates that they want him back soon to play \"police and tsotsis\" - South African cops and robbers.</p> <p>Yesterday a note arrived from Nkosi's girlfriend, Sweetiepie Khumalo. Older friends and neighbours are allowed to see him, but Johnson keeps the rest at bay.</p> <p>\"We've got people who want to come and do the healing and that kind of thing. It's more for their need than mine. I don't want Nkosi inundated with strangers in his room. I tell them they can just as easily heal him from their own houses,\" she says.</p> <p>Some have called on Thabo Mbeki to visit Nkosi, but the president has been badly stung by the local and international denunciations of his controversial Aids policies - and criticism of the human cost describe by the young boy at the Durban conference - so he has largely withdrawn from the public debate over the disease.</p> <p>Instead, Mbeki sent wife, Zanele, to visit Nkosi. It was said to be a private visit but it was saturated in politics. Johnson left the two alone in the bedroom.</p> <p>Nkosi's grandmother, Ruth, and great aunt, Mavis Khubeka, are often at his bedside.

He's given Aids a face and shown that Aids does not discriminate. It attacks all races, all ages. He's also given people hope because until recently he wasn't on the drugs.

Donald Dewar and John Smith met at Glasgow University, their passion moulded in the students' union and brought to maturity in the intense struggles of Labour's wilderness years.</p> <p>They rejected displays of nationalist fervour, but shared the certainty that Scotland's particular legal, cultural and educational traditions deserved recognition within the UK state. It was a sophisticated faith, moulded by long years of experience in Scottish and Westminster politics. Each was convinced that a democratic deficit existed in the UK constitution and that measured reform could fill it without posing any threat to the union.</p> <p>Smith's death left Dewar with an awesome responsibility; one he discharged with customary courage and ruthless attention to detail.

      "bodyText": "Devolved Scotland did not choose to be a single-parent family. It was conceived by an odd but stable couple. Donald Dewar and John Smith met at Glasgow University, their passion moulded in the students' union and brought to maturity in the intense struggles of Labour's wilderness years. They rejected displays of nationalist fervour, but shared the certainty that Scotland's particular legal, cultural and educational traditions deserved recognition within the UK state. It was a sophisticated faith, moulded by long years of experience in Scottish and Westminster politics. Each was convinced that a democratic deficit existed in the UK constitution and that measured reform could fill it without posing any threat to the union. Smith's death left Dewar with an awesome responsibility; one he discharged with customary courage and ruthless attention to detail. Scotland got her parliament, and Dewar guided its first faltering steps. But then, three months ago, Dewar died too and Scotland was bereft. His absence hurts not because Dewar was universally loved; he was not. But because his was the mind that squared the circle.

      "body": "<p>Until radio was invented in the first decade of the 20th century, most ships were unable to talk to land. Seafarers vanished over the horizon to an unknown fate. Yet as early as 1850 a few vessels managed to contact land from the high seas. Laying undersea cables for the new electric telegraph, they sent messages back over the wire to their point of departure. </p> <p>Major advances in technology usually have precursors - noble failures that prove to be a technological blind alley. </p> <p>Take Charles Babbage, who in 1833 built the first computer, and Ada, Countess of Lovelace, who pondered its software. Their \"analytical engine\" was entirely mechanical, and so doomed to failure. </p> <p>A few years later, Charles Wheatstone built an electromechanical \"gate\", an early version of the building-block from which present-day computers are constructed, while in Ireland George Boole pioneered the binary arithmetic that underpins modern computer architecture. But Victorian electrical computers did not happen. Not until a century later did Tom Flowers built Colossus, the first successful electronic computer </p> <p>Meanwhile, on the roads, first-generation steam- propelled horseless carriages were swept away by the internal combustion engine. Before 1914, airships provided a commercial passenger service inside Germany, yet kites, not balloons, are the ancestors of modern airliners. </p> <p>Why are precursors like this so common? To get started, inventions have three basic requirements. They must be technically feasible, there must be an evident demand for what they do, but above all, they must have charm. Nobody will try something that seems impossible, and nobody will finance a development which does not answer a need. But charm is the crucial ingredient. </p> <p>Charm is elegance, confidence and the sense of finding something long sought. It persuades young engineers to make a hunch their cause, and lures older professionals into staking all on raising the necessary backing. If any of these three essentials are missing or weak you get only a precursor. Until the coming of radio, ships at sea were isolated because communication with them failed on feasibility. The Victorian computer was feasible and would have met a need, but the idea was never articulated clearly enough to generate charm. </p> <p>Airships have irresistible charm and met a need but were never entirely feasible, as their many disasters proved. All these things were just might-have-beens. By contrast, the mobile phone addressed a world of latent users, was made feasible by microelectronics, charmed the socks off its engineers and created the fastest growing industry in history. </p> <p>Yet we ought to take seriously these romantic failures, because they point to the future. Most technological development is bigger, faster, more powerful, cheaper ver sions of what went before. But occasionally engineering takes a knight's move, out of the straightforward, creating something entirely different. </p> <p>Such leaps of imagination are difficult to predict. Futurologists never spot them. But often they have precursors. So what do I tip as important precursors now? The first is nanotechnology, the technology of the very small. We can envisage versatile machines smaller than the eye can see. Nanotechnology has the prospect of advancing medi cine to an inconceivable point, solving pollution problems, and transforming manufacturing processes in an ecology-friendly way. It could save the planet, but it also has alarming military potential. Already on microelectronic silicon chips we fabricate things with dimensions down to a thousandth of the thickness of a human hair. </p> <p>And my second precursor? We have been at it for half a century already, but even so my choice is space travel. It has great charm and fills a need but it still ranks as just a precursor because its present feasibility is only achieved at great cost. Space vehicles which are 90% fuel at takeoff cannot be right; they are the steam cars of space, the airships of the cosmos.The day we work out how to do it properly - using nanotechnology, for all I know - we shall make science fiction look tame. </p> <p>\u0095 William Gosling is a past-president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers</p>",

      "bodyText": "Until radio was invented in the first decade of the 20th century, most ships were unable to talk to land. Seafarers vanished over the horizon to an unknown fate. Yet as early as 1850 a few vessels managed to contact land from the high seas. Laying undersea cables for the new electric telegraph, they sent messages back over the wire to their point of departure. Major advances in technology usually have precursors - noble failures that prove to be a technological blind alley. Take Charles Babbage, who in 1833 built the first computer, and Ada, Countess of Lovelace, who pondered its software. Their \"analytical engine\" was entirely mechanical, and so doomed to failure. A few years later, Charles Wheatstone built an electromechanical \"gate\", an early version of the building-block from which present-day computers are constructed, while in Ireland George Boole pioneered the binary arithmetic that underpins modern computer architecture. But Victorian electrical computers did not happen. Not until a century later did Tom Flowers built Colossus, the first successful electronic computer Meanwhile, on the roads, first-generation steam- propelled horseless carriages were swept away by the internal combustion engine. Before 1914, airships provided a commercial passenger service inside Germany, yet kites, not balloons, are the ancestors of modern airliners. Why are precursors like this so common? To get started, inventions have three basic requirements. They must be technically feasible, there must be an evident demand for what they do, but above all, they must have charm. Nobody will try something that seems impossible, and nobody will finance a development which does not answer a need. But charm is the crucial ingredient. Charm is elegance, confidence and the sense of finding something long sought. It persuades young engineers to make a hunch their cause, and lures older professionals into staking all on raising the necessary backing. If any of these three essentials are missing or weak you get only a precursor. Until the coming of radio, ships at sea were isolated because communication with them failed on feasibility. The Victorian computer was feasible and would have met a need, but the idea was never articulated clearly enough to generate charm. Airships have irresistible charm and met a need but were never entirely feasible, as their many disasters proved. All these things were just might-have-beens. By contrast, the mobile phone addressed a world of latent users, was made feasible by microelectronics, charmed the socks off its engineers and created the fastest growing industry in history. Yet we ought to take seriously these romantic failures, because they point to the future. Most technological development is bigger, faster, more powerful, cheaper ver sions of what went before. But occasionally engineering takes a knight's move, out of the straightforward, creating something entirely different. Such leaps of imagination are difficult to predict. Futurologists never spot them. But often they have precursors. So what do I tip as important precursors now? The first is nanotechnology, the technology of the very small. We can envisage versatile machines smaller than the eye can see. Nanotechnology has the prospect of advancing medi cine to an inconceivable point, solving pollution problems, and transforming manufacturing processes in an ecology-friendly way. It could save the planet, but it also has alarming military potential. Already on microelectronic silicon chips we fabricate things with dimensions down to a thousandth of the thickness of a human hair. And my second precursor? We have been at it for half a century already, but even so my choice is space travel. It has great charm and fills a need but it still ranks as just a precursor because its present feasibility is only achieved at great cost. Space vehicles which are 90% fuel at takeoff cannot be right; they are the steam cars of space, the airships of the cosmos.The day we work out how to do it properly - using nanotechnology, for all I know - we shall make science fiction look tame. \u0095 William Gosling is a past-president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers",

Jankowski believes that US shoppers will appreciate the speed of the system and the way it does away with the need for a signature. The highlight of Sony's stand was a prototype of its blue laser optical disc recorder. Sony believes that the system, which can archive 22 gigabytes of high- definition video on one DVD (five times as much as current discs), will be on sale within five years. Sony also unveiled a web tablet that is expected to go on sale in the US later in the year for around $3000, and an AV/IT Gateway that comprises a touch-screen monitor and a base station. Owners can use the Gateway to surf the net, send email and watch video from a number of sources. Neither product is expected to go on sale in the UK. Britons will however be taking delivery of several DVD and Super Audio CD players, a MiniDisc personal recorder that uses MDLP technology to fit five hours of music on one disc, hi-fi and PC CD-R/CD-RW burners, and two Network Walkmans. Several of the impressive prototypes that Panasonic showed on its stand last year turned up as real-world products this time round. Americans will soon be able to purchase two digital audio/MP3 players that use SD (Secure Digital) removable storage cards. They take the form of a necklace/wrist band (SV-D75) or a pair of headphones (SV-D05). Both are expected in the UK in the summer. Panasonic also paraded a DVD-ram based camcorder, the VDR-M10 and its first digital camera - the PV-DC3000. Almost all the major players displayed DVD video recorder several of which are already on sale in the US. However a re-run of the Betamax-VHS battle now seems a certainty with recorders using three competing formats/discs - DVD-ram (Panasonic, Samsung), DVD-RW (Pioneer) and DVD+RW (Philips) heading for the UK later in the year. Sony chose to sit on the fence in offering a DVD video recorder that works with DVD+RW and DVD-RW discs. It won't go on sale until 2002. Other Vegas showstoppers included a portable hard disk from Iomega, a removable flash memory format from Dataplay, MP3-equipped sunglasses from Thomson, an internet/email watch from Timex, and our favourite, a smart frying pan that bleeps when your food is cooked, from Digital Cookware.",

However, the stock ended the day just 0.75p better at 75p, after reports that the company had dismissed the speculation. At the seriously speculative end of the market, dealers were showing an unusual interest in Aim-listed, gold miner Griffin Mining, up 0.5p to 4.5p. According to the gossips Griffin has managed to raise a large amount of cash through the sale of stock to investors at 5p per share.",

Born in Brownsville, Texas, in 1969, he moved to Tujunga with his family when he was two and graduated from high school in 1988. He studied respiratory therapy at college and became a state certified respiratory care practitioner in 1989. He was soon working at the Glendale medical centre where he remained until the scandal first broke three years ago. Mr Saldivar spoke at the time of his initial arrest of his desire to be executed. As California is one of the states which carries out such penalties, he may yet have his wish granted.",

And I decided, well, I don't know if I want to play classical music because I can't improvise, I can't put myself into it.\" </p> <p>\"Putting himself into it\" somehow sums up the approach of the man credited by many as the originator of soul, a unique mixture of blues, gospel and jazz. \"Each song speaks for itself,\" he says. \"So if I'm singing Georgia, I try to put myself into the lyrics of that song. And if I'm singing I Can't Stop Loving You, I try to make myself think like the guy talking to the girl. You put yourself into the voice of the song so you can feel what the song is dictating.\" </p> <p>Charles sang America the Beautiful at Ronald Reagan's inauguration and at a presidential function for Bill Clinton - with carefully selected verses. \"It has four verses and two of them, to me, just didn't go.

I used the verses that fitted what I was trying to say.\" </p> <p>He talks about his friendship with Martin Luther King, and his decision to visit South Africa. \"It was strange in a way, but if you grow up in the south, in a small town, you don't think that much about segregation as it is a way of life. But as you get older you see what's happening. When I played in the south they used to make the black people sit upstairs and the white people sit downstairs. I wouldn't perform as long as the crowd were segregated like that.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the sunny sculpture garden of the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts in the Normandy city of Rouen, some clown has put boxes around the reclining sculptures so you can't see them properly. Or rather you can, but only if you look into the tilted mirror that rests on top of each box like an opened lid. </p> <p>The walls of each box, however, reflect only the viewer, and so one stands at the threshold of an exhibition devoted to the role of mirror in art looking at oneself - a picture of self-consciousness rather than narcissistic self-absorption. </p> <p>Letters have been written and angry voices raised about this concealment of beautiful classical statues by some clever clogs post-modernist. But these critics should think again. The boxes are the work of the French artist Daniel Buren; titled Couvrir, Recouvrir, Entrouvrir, D\u00e9couvrir, they are a brilliant exploration of the role of the mirror in art. Brilliant because mirrors have been such a preoccupation for artists from ancient Egypt to today's New York studios that it's difficult to do anything new with them. </p> <p>The mirror is everywhere in great art. In Velazquez's Las Meninas we find the painter reflected in a mirror in the corner of the canvas, his steady, hungry, scrupulous gaze bearing down on the subjects of the painting. In Van Eyck's The Arnolfini Marriage, the gruesome, distorted couple are further distorted by the convex mirror above and behind them. </p> <p>There's a mirror too in Manet's Bar aux Folies-Berg\u00e8res, the last in a series of paintings in which spectacularly bored women return the artist's and spectator's gaze. You can't miss this mirror. Placed behind the barmaid, it seems to reflect her back as she takes the order from a top-hatted customer, or listens to his shady propositioning. But her reflection is at an impossible angle, leaving us thinking that the barmaid is alienated from everything - including her own reflection. </p> <p>The mirror in art says too much. It speaks of everything from Narcissus to Big Brother. It talks about the relationship between sex and power, and between men and women. It has been used so much that it raises the question: how can an artist nowadays engage with the mirror and say something that doesn't degenerate into game-playing or banality? </p> <p>But Buren has succeeded in saying something new and suggestive. His boxes tell the story of the dialectic between the voyeur and the narcissist. The mirror both allows us to look at a human form from a hitherto secret view and confronts us with our own gaze in a disturbing context. It's nicer to look at oneself on the sly in the bathroom mirror, to control the consumption of one's image; rather more upsetting to be confronted with oneself in a very public hall. In a sense, then, Buren's work is revenge on behalf of all those pictures and sculptures that have no choice but to be looked at. </p> <p>In Kant and the Platypus, Umberto Eco writes that, as well as being a puzzle (everybody from Lucretius to Kant has worried that mirror reverses right and left but not up and down - so your left hand becomes your right but your head does not become your foot), the mirror is also a prosthesis: the first mirrors, after all, were hand mirrors, extensions of one's arms. That is why we trust the ordinary mirror to show us reliably what is there. This is why we allow Buren's mirrors to show us the hitherto unseen - a marble breast from above, or rippling back muscles from a hitherto inaccessible angle. </p> <p>There were once His and Hers mirrors. In ancient Greece, only women used bronzed mirrors; men instead looked into their wine cups to find themselves. As Aeschylus put it: \"The mirror of beauty is the bronze. The wine is that of the soul.\" But he was a man, so he would say that. In ancient Greece, alcoholic drinks were a man's preserve, and by looking into the reflection of a cup of wine, a man would see himself, at least on the reflective surface. As men drank, the reflective surface disappeared, so Greek potters painted drunken images of men's faces at the bottom of each cup, each one a two-dimensional gargoyle. That, they said, is what you look like when you're pissed. </p> <p>Rouen's Mus\u00e9e D\u00e9partemental des Antiquit\u00e9s is holding a related exhibition, Games and Reflections Since Antiquity, which contains models of such antique wine cups, painting ugly mugs in the bottom of the bowls. The exhibition, tells a fascinating story about the mirror's role in the battle of the sexes. </p> <p>In Olivier de la Marche's 15th-century painted parchment Adornment and Triumph of Women (on show in the same museum), a man holds a mirror up for a lady. He may be on his knees, but he has the power in the form of this moral prosthesis. By this time women were using mirrors to counteract rather than feed their vanity. Mirrors, ideally, would correct a woman's faults, and show her how to cultivate a chaste comportment and modest dress sense. This was a masculine mirror, then, and a restraint on the naturally licentious nature of woman. </p> <p>It's fascinating to compare this image with Balthus's 1908 painting Les Beaux Jours, at the Beaux-Arts. On the right, a burly half-naked man is on his knees, poking a roaring fire. On the left, Lolita's younger sister reclines on a chaise, one leg raised in such a manner that the hulk need only turn slightly to see up her skirt. She wouldn't mind if he did: after all, she's lost in her hand mirror, contemplating her self-satisfied reflection. </p> <p>This, we are to suppose, is the feminine mirror, the one that lures women into a sick world of masturbatory self-absorption. At the same time, the painting seethes with heterosexual tension. Will the man turn round and see what he shouldn't? Could he ever be as interested in the girl's image as she is? Of course not - you don't look at the mantelpiece while you're poking the fire. </p> <p>The painting appears in a section of the Beaux-Arts exhibition called The Mirror and Femininity. All the usual suspects are there: Picasso, Man Ray and Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz - the latter stretching nude women's bodies into mercury writhings. There are no works by women in this section. Instead, there is a quotation from Louis Aragon printed on the wall, a message to his lover: \"And when you leave I am as unhappy as your mirror.\" </p> <p>But, in art, when the mirror is empty, the artist fills it with himself. Artists tend to find themselves endlessly interesting, always reliably there. The French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan wrote of the mirror stage in which the infant, by looking in the mirror, finds itself coherent and whole for the first time. </p> <p>But artists don't need actual mirrors to cultivate self-image. Tracey Emin's unmade bed does very well, although the canvas came first. Consider Albrecht Durer's Self-Portrait (1500). There he is, some pretty boy proto-hippy fingering his treated hair (did men use curlers in 1500?), staring out of the canvas. The viewers are his mirror, and we reflect and share his self-absorption. Everyone who paints themselves to their satisfaction in this way sells their soul for their image: in this way, Durer is Dorian Gray's precursor. </p> <p>But one's self-image becomes an irksome thing. At the Beaux-Arts, a wonderful Super 8 film by Vito Acconi called See Through shows a sad-eyed man, with a woeful feather- cut, slowly shadow-boxing his mirror image. Acconi is locked in a Sisyphean struggle with himself. Narcissus never knew there would be such a downside. </p> <p>When people write about mirrors, they go on about Narcissus, when they should be writing about his dog. There's the mutt now, licking the water in which his master studies his reflection, in a 1630 book engraving by Blaise de Vigen\u00e8re to illustrate a text by the Greek Philostratus. Traditionally, the dog hasn't had a name, but let's call him Rebel - he's the one who stands up against Philostratus's boring dictum: \"The two Narcissuses are identical and shine with the same beauty.\" If you look at this illustration, you'll see that Rebel is doing his damnedest to break up Narcissus's image. But Vigen\u00e8re's engraving won't allow such subversion, and the water stays calm. </p> <p>Rebel speaks of the other history of the mirror, in which the self-image is not held in reflection forever. Rebel would be pleased to see that there are lots of game-playing art works that misrepresent or refuse to represent the spectator. At the Beaux-Arts, a Gerhard Richter painting of a grey surface that refuses to reflect anything, but instead consumes all glances, is a particularly nice curatorial joke in the context of this exhibition. Anish Kapoor's bronze egg misreflects and, disturbingly, unreflects the spectator through a series of cunning effects. </p> <p>Before Kapoor, Magritte created lying prostheses: think of his surrealist gag The Forbidden Reproduction, in which the spectator looks at the back of a man's head and beyond the man is a mirror that reflects the back of the same head. But the greatest current artist of the mirror is Bruce Nauman. </p> <p>A 33-year-old video work, on show at the Beaux-Arts, sees Naumann slowly applying make-up to his face, neck and shoulders while he looks off to the left toward (we suppose) a mirror. In one video he applies white. In another green. A third, pink. In the final one, black. His sad eyes tell the story of a man trapped in his own self-obsessed drama. This new Narcissus is all made up with nowhere to go, and nothing to do but apply more make-up and look at himself for all eternity. </p> <p>\u0095 Through the Mirror: from Bonnard to Buren is at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts in Rouen, France (00 33 2 35 71 28 40), until January 21. Games and Reflections Since Antiquity is at the Mus\u00e9e des Antiquit\u00e9s, Rouen (00 33 2 35 98 55 10), until February 26.</p>",

The wine is that of the soul.\" But he was a man, so he would say that. In ancient Greece, alcoholic drinks were a man's preserve, and by looking into the reflection of a cup of wine, a man would see himself, at least on the reflective surface. As men drank, the reflective surface disappeared, so Greek potters painted drunken images of men's faces at the bottom of each cup, each one a two-dimensional gargoyle. That, they said, is what you look like when you're pissed. Rouen's Mus\u00e9e D\u00e9partemental des Antiquit\u00e9s is holding a related exhibition, Games and Reflections Since Antiquity, which contains models of such antique wine cups, painting ugly mugs in the bottom of the bowls. The exhibition, tells a fascinating story about the mirror's role in the battle of the sexes. In Olivier de la Marche's 15th-century painted parchment Adornment and Triumph of Women (on show in the same museum), a man holds a mirror up for a lady. He may be on his knees, but he has the power in the form of this moral prosthesis. By this time women were using mirrors to counteract rather than feed their vanity. Mirrors, ideally, would correct a woman's faults, and show her how to cultivate a chaste comportment and modest dress sense. This was a masculine mirror, then, and a restraint on the naturally licentious nature of woman. It's fascinating to compare this image with Balthus's 1908 painting Les Beaux Jours, at the Beaux-Arts. On the right, a burly half-naked man is on his knees, poking a roaring fire. On the left, Lolita's younger sister reclines on a chaise, one leg raised in such a manner that the hulk need only turn slightly to see up her skirt. She wouldn't mind if he did: after all, she's lost in her hand mirror, contemplating her self-satisfied reflection. This, we are to suppose, is the feminine mirror, the one that lures women into a sick world of masturbatory self-absorption. At the same time, the painting seethes with heterosexual tension. Will the man turn round and see what he shouldn't? Could he ever be as interested in the girl's image as she is? Of course not - you don't look at the mantelpiece while you're poking the fire. The painting appears in a section of the Beaux-Arts exhibition called The Mirror and Femininity. All the usual suspects are there: Picasso, Man Ray and Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz - the latter stretching nude women's bodies into mercury writhings. There are no works by women in this section. Instead, there is a quotation from Louis Aragon printed on the wall, a message to his lover: \"And when you leave I am as unhappy as your mirror.\" But, in art, when the mirror is empty, the artist fills it with himself. Artists tend to find themselves endlessly interesting, always reliably there. The French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan wrote of the mirror stage in which the infant, by looking in the mirror, finds itself coherent and whole for the first time. But artists don't need actual mirrors to cultivate self-image. Tracey Emin's unmade bed does very well, although the canvas came first. Consider Albrecht Durer's Self-Portrait (1500). There he is, some pretty boy proto-hippy fingering his treated hair (did men use curlers in 1500?), staring out of the canvas. The viewers are his mirror, and we reflect and share his self-absorption. Everyone who paints themselves to their satisfaction in this way sells their soul for their image: in this way, Durer is Dorian Gray's precursor. But one's self-image becomes an irksome thing. At the Beaux-Arts, a wonderful Super 8 film by Vito Acconi called See Through shows a sad-eyed man, with a woeful feather- cut, slowly shadow-boxing his mirror image. Acconi is locked in a Sisyphean struggle with himself. Narcissus never knew there would be such a downside. When people write about mirrors, they go on about Narcissus, when they should be writing about his dog. There's the mutt now, licking the water in which his master studies his reflection, in a 1630 book engraving by Blaise de Vigen\u00e8re to illustrate a text by the Greek Philostratus. Traditionally, the dog hasn't had a name, but let's call him Rebel - he's the one who stands up against Philostratus's boring dictum: \"The two Narcissuses are identical and shine with the same beauty.\" If you look at this illustration, you'll see that Rebel is doing his damnedest to break up Narcissus's image. But Vigen\u00e8re's engraving won't allow such subversion, and the water stays calm. Rebel speaks of the other history of the mirror, in which the self-image is not held in reflection forever. Rebel would be pleased to see that there are lots of game-playing art works that misrepresent or refuse to represent the spectator. At the Beaux-Arts, a Gerhard Richter painting of a grey surface that refuses to reflect anything, but instead consumes all glances, is a particularly nice curatorial joke in the context of this exhibition. Anish Kapoor's bronze egg misreflects and, disturbingly, unreflects the spectator through a series of cunning effects. Before Kapoor, Magritte created lying prostheses: think of his surrealist gag The Forbidden Reproduction, in which the spectator looks at the back of a man's head and beyond the man is a mirror that reflects the back of the same head. But the greatest current artist of the mirror is Bruce Nauman. A 33-year-old video work, on show at the Beaux-Arts, sees Naumann slowly applying make-up to his face, neck and shoulders while he looks off to the left toward (we suppose) a mirror. In one video he applies white. In another green. A third, pink. In the final one, black. His sad eyes tell the story of a man trapped in his own self-obsessed drama. This new Narcissus is all made up with nowhere to go, and nothing to do but apply more make-up and look at himself for all eternity. \u0095 Through the Mirror: from Bonnard to Buren is at the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts in Rouen, France (00 33 2 35 71 28 40), until January 21. Games and Reflections Since Antiquity is at the Mus\u00e9e des Antiquit\u00e9s, Rouen (00 33 2 35 98 55 10), until February 26.",

      "bodyText": "Another timber structure has been discovered on the beach off Holme-next-the-Sea, Norfolk, near the site of Seahenge, the 4,000-year-old timber circle revealed by a storm two years ago. The discovery suggests the entire beach is an important prehistoric ritual landscape, with dozens more timber monuments waiting to be exposed and destroyed by storms, archaeologist Francis Pryor said last night. Dr Pryor is an authority on wetland archaeology, who worked on the conservation of the Seahenge timbers after they were removed from the beach by English Heritage against bitter local opposition. The new find, two logs surrounded by traces of wickerwork and post holes, was exposed in the sand last year but, in the wake of controversy over Seahenge, it was not publicised. The Norfolk Archaeology Unit, which is completing a survey for English Heritage, has also found traces of other ancient timbers, including posts which may have supported trackways across what was, 4,000 years ago, a freshwater swamp. English Heritage said reports on all the timbers were being studied, and no decision had been taken yet on what to do with the site, 200 metres from Seahenge. Dr Pryor predicted the entire site would prove to be studded with monuments to the Bronze Age dead. \"It is now absolutely imperative that English Heritage and English Nature agree a management plan for the entire area, involving the local council, local people and the local archaeology unit, and permanent archaeological monitoring of the beach,\" he said. Dr Pryor believes the new find is the remains of a barrow. \"To me the two logs are very suggestive of supports for an oak coffin, which has already been lost.\" He said it was probable there were perhaps hundreds of other structures. Dr Pryor led the excavation over 30 years of a similar site, Flag Fen at Peterborough, where Bronze Age swords, bowls, jewellery and the oldest wooden wheel in Europe were uncovered. He believes there are similar deposits waiting to be found in the sand and silt at Holme.",

Another old woman came over and rubbed at the glands and knots in my legs, which apparently communicate with the stomach, and the illness soon abated. Not once did anyone suggest medicine. Outside, Uncle was back at work, on a Lada this time, tinkering with a panel. Was he excited about the new millennium, I asked. \"I don't really see what all the fuss is about. What's to celebrate? You're born in the 20th century, you die in the 21st. There.\"",

      "body": "<p> Even in terms of bald statistics, it's impossible not to be impressed by the Park Lane Group's annual Young Artists Series. By the end of this week, 33 young players will have performed 60 20th-century works - the vast majority written in the last decade - including 11 world premieres. </p> <p>And going by the quality of the first two days of concerts, there is cause for celebration at the excellence of the next generation of performers, and their dedication to new music. Two solo recitals by 18-year-old So-Ock Kim on violin and 16-year-old Wu Qian on piano were outstanding.

By the end of this week, 33 young players will have performed 60 20th-century works - the vast majority written in the last decade - including 11 world premieres. And going by the quality of the first two days of concerts, there is cause for celebration at the excellence of the next generation of performers, and their dedication to new music. Two solo recitals by 18-year-old So-Ock Kim on violin and 16-year-old Wu Qian on piano were outstanding. Both featured some of the most challenging music of the last 20 years, with performances that would grace any of the world's new music stages.

City analysts had predicted the \"no change\" decision from the Bank's nine-member monetary policy committee which was announced following their monthly meeting. However, pressure for a reduction in the cost of borrowing had intensified since last week's surprise rate cut by the US federal reserve to counter the weakening of the American economy. The Confederation of British Industry and the British Chambers of Commerce had urged the Bank of England to follow suit in order to protect the UK from a global economic downturn. Two MPC members, DeAnne Julius and Sushil Wadhwani, had called for a \"pre-emptive\" quarter-point rate cut at the last meeting in December, citing the slowdown in the world economy.

Dawn Hope produces a sensationally well-modulated performance, never allowing the sparkling transcendence of the songs to become tarnished by the morass of misery that surrounds them. Holiday always insisted that the right accompanist was the one who would help you feel your way through the songs, in which case Warren Wills is a more than reliable guide. Exuding a sullen presence as Holiday's current partner, he stares mournfully at the piano keys while the singer, in her reverie, addresses him as her fatal first love, the spineless husband who introduced her to heroin. Holiday's mother said her special talent was to pick out the rottenest apple and cling to it - but then Strange Fruit was always Billie's taste. \u0095 Until January 20. Box office: 0133-236 3275.",
