      "byline": "Ron Atkinson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I get asked a lot why so many people take an instant dislike to Doug Ellis. My answer is that it saves time. But, while there is no love lost between me and my one-time chairman, we do share a great affection for Aston Villa and I must say I back the stance he's taking right now.</p> <p>Villa fans are calling for vast amounts to be spent on the team but, with the transfer market in a state of flux, I would see it as irresponsible to pay outrageous fees. A few months down the line a signing could have his value slashed. Only Leeds seem to be spending massive money.</p> <p>That is not to say Villa shouldn't buy, and John Gregory is about to get Colombia's Juan Pablo Angel for around \u00a310m. That's a massive gamble and a lot of money for somebody who doesn't have a recognised international pedigree.</p> <p>To take this very useful Villa side to the next level Gregory needs the best but who is there? I know that Fabrizio Ravanelli was available on a free transfer a few months ago. Someone like that, over a short period, might have filled the void.</p> <p>Angel's arrival may well dampen the anti-Ellis feeling at Villa. But what is certain is that the fans who want him to quit haven't got a chance. The only way he'll go is if they carry him out feet first.</p> <p>There is a perception that Doug Ellis is tight-fisted but in my experience, if you could justify a transfer, he would back you by and large. At times, though, he could be impulsive and beg you to buy players when you didn't need any and at other times he would dither.</p> <p>I remember him telling me just before I finished the job in 1994: \"Go and buy somebody.\" I told him we didn't need anybody, that the team would pull round and he should save his money to compete for the best players the next summer. I had in mind people like Les Ferdinand, who was top of the range and went to Newcastle.</p> <p>At the other end of the scale he messed around after I had agreed a deal with Liverpool for Dean Saunders. It was obvious we needed a striker to make us a decent team and I had set everything up with Graeme Souness. But the transfer went through about three weeks later because Doug Ellis was trying to deal and counter-deal. In the end it was virtually the same as we had agreed in the first place.</p> <p>Even if Angel joins, John Gregory apparently wants a couple more players. It may be that he'll have to use those wheeling and dealing abilities he needed at the lower end of management with Wycombe. John appears to have a team with an awful lot of very good midfield players and may have to trade one or two to get bodies in.</p> <p>I questioned the signing of David Ginola from the start. That has nothing to do with ability because I'm Ginola's biggest fan. But to utilise him fully I think he has to be played on the wing, providing crosses Dion Dublin can thrive on, as we saw against Manchester City on Saturday.</p> <p>Villa, though, do not play with wingers, more with wing-backs, and, if you don't put him on the wing, you have to use him in a free role, and Merson already does that job.</p> <p>It may be that the money there would have been better used elsewhere, although I'm not too sure who bought the player. Rumour has it that what started the ball rolling was Doug Ellis meeting Ginola on holday in Mauritius over the summer.</p> <p>Not that I ever found him interfering; I never let him. He was very good at getting the stadium organised when I was there. That took up about \u00a36m a summer and restricted buying but I understood that.</p> <p>I'm sure the flak he has taken will have hurt him. Doug is very sensitive to criticism. He likes to think of himself as Mr Aston Villa, the man of the people, whereas my love of the Villa stems from the fact that they were the team I supported as a boy.</p> <p>I was watching television and had to smile when all of a sudden he went missing when Villa went 2-1 down to City. Whether he had a cold and had gone to watch from his boardroom, which he can do, I don't know. But I couldn't help thinking that, if they had gone 2-1 up, he wouldn't have disappeared.</p> <p>For all the criticism, Ellis has done some good. Villa Park is a marvellous stadium. In his eyes it will be a monument to him. The standing joke was that he named one stand The Doug Ellis Stand so that, when he was knighted, it could quickly be altered to Sir Doug Ellis Stand.</p> <p>Certainly his decision to sack me wasn't just a footballing one. We had a personality clash. I don't think he liked it much that I was popular with the fans, nor that after a game my little bar near the dressing room was packed with football people.

      "bodyText": "I get asked a lot why so many people take an instant dislike to Doug Ellis. My answer is that it saves time. But, while there is no love lost between me and my one-time chairman, we do share a great affection for Aston Villa and I must say I back the stance he's taking right now. Villa fans are calling for vast amounts to be spent on the team but, with the transfer market in a state of flux, I would see it as irresponsible to pay outrageous fees. A few months down the line a signing could have his value slashed. Only Leeds seem to be spending massive money. That is not to say Villa shouldn't buy, and John Gregory is about to get Colombia's Juan Pablo Angel for around \u00a310m. That's a massive gamble and a lot of money for somebody who doesn't have a recognised international pedigree. To take this very useful Villa side to the next level Gregory needs the best but who is there? I know that Fabrizio Ravanelli was available on a free transfer a few months ago. Someone like that, over a short period, might have filled the void. Angel's arrival may well dampen the anti-Ellis feeling at Villa. But what is certain is that the fans who want him to quit haven't got a chance. The only way he'll go is if they carry him out feet first. There is a perception that Doug Ellis is tight-fisted but in my experience, if you could justify a transfer, he would back you by and large. At times, though, he could be impulsive and beg you to buy players when you didn't need any and at other times he would dither. I remember him telling me just before I finished the job in 1994: \"Go and buy somebody.\" I told him we didn't need anybody, that the team would pull round and he should save his money to compete for the best players the next summer. I had in mind people like Les Ferdinand, who was top of the range and went to Newcastle. At the other end of the scale he messed around after I had agreed a deal with Liverpool for Dean Saunders. It was obvious we needed a striker to make us a decent team and I had set everything up with Graeme Souness. But the transfer went through about three weeks later because Doug Ellis was trying to deal and counter-deal. In the end it was virtually the same as we had agreed in the first place. Even if Angel joins, John Gregory apparently wants a couple more players. It may be that he'll have to use those wheeling and dealing abilities he needed at the lower end of management with Wycombe. John appears to have a team with an awful lot of very good midfield players and may have to trade one or two to get bodies in. I questioned the signing of David Ginola from the start. That has nothing to do with ability because I'm Ginola's biggest fan. But to utilise him fully I think he has to be played on the wing, providing crosses Dion Dublin can thrive on, as we saw against Manchester City on Saturday. Villa, though, do not play with wingers, more with wing-backs, and, if you don't put him on the wing, you have to use him in a free role, and Merson already does that job. It may be that the money there would have been better used elsewhere, although I'm not too sure who bought the player. Rumour has it that what started the ball rolling was Doug Ellis meeting Ginola on holday in Mauritius over the summer. Not that I ever found him interfering; I never let him. He was very good at getting the stadium organised when I was there. That took up about \u00a36m a summer and restricted buying but I understood that. I'm sure the flak he has taken will have hurt him. Doug is very sensitive to criticism. He likes to think of himself as Mr Aston Villa, the man of the people, whereas my love of the Villa stems from the fact that they were the team I supported as a boy. I was watching television and had to smile when all of a sudden he went missing when Villa went 2-1 down to City. Whether he had a cold and had gone to watch from his boardroom, which he can do, I don't know. But I couldn't help thinking that, if they had gone 2-1 up, he wouldn't have disappeared. For all the criticism, Ellis has done some good. Villa Park is a marvellous stadium. In his eyes it will be a monument to him. The standing joke was that he named one stand The Doug Ellis Stand so that, when he was knighted, it could quickly be altered to Sir Doug Ellis Stand. Certainly his decision to sack me wasn't just a footballing one. We had a personality clash. I don't think he liked it much that I was popular with the fans, nor that after a game my little bar near the dressing room was packed with football people. He had this massive boardroom and I think he wanted to be part of the magic circle. The only time we've spoken since was in a television studio about three years ago. He came over in his manner to say something and I told him where to go. It didn't go down too well with him because Gareth Southgate and Andy Townsend were with me. Now if we see one another we stay well away. It's mutual hate. But I'm with him on this one. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

At the end of a difficult week he had just finished watching with mounting dismay as his strategy for the following day's match against Germany had been torn apart by a quartet of television pundits. He had been called a liar and accused of cowardice. And he knew that his players had been watching, too, on the TV sets in the lounges or in their rooms at Burnham Beeches Hotel. The glad, confident morning on which he had taken the role of England's head coach, barely 18 months earlier, had turned into a wintry twilight. </p> <p>Over the preceding days, as the England players gathered at Burnham and prepared for the match on the training pitch at Bisham Abbey, his staff had noticed the change in him. The death of his mother 12 days before the match had not just saddened but profoundly depressed him. Doris Keegan, aged 76, died in hospital after suffering a suspected stroke at her home in Armthorpe, the South Yorkshire village where her son had been born and where she had remained since the death of her husband 14 years earlier. There was no surprise when the customary press conference to announce the squad was cancelled. </p> <p>When reporters arrived at the England squad's hotel in Burnham Beeches, near Maidenhead, the following week for the usual run of pre-match interviews, they found the normally bouncy Keegan in an uncharacteristically tense frame of mind as he approached the opening fixture in England's campaign to qualify for the 2002 World Cup. The coach made his first appearance on Tuesday. On Thursday afternoon he stayed away, allowing David Davies, the FA's executive director, to answer routine inquiries about the fitness of individual players. </p> <p>What the reporters were not told was that during the afternoon Steven Gerrard, the 20-year-old Liverpool midfield player, had been declared unfit. When a tabloid reporter got wind of the story late on Thursday night and published it in the next morning's paper, his rivals were angered by what was seen as a lack of the sort of candour Keegan had promised when he took over the England job. At his Friday press conference David Lacey, this newspaper's football correspondent, was deputed to express the press's dismay at being led up the garden path. Clearly on edge, Keegan rejected the point, saying that it was not his job to reveal every detail of the team's preparation. </p> <p><strong> Scorn over selection</strong><br> </p> <p> A few hours later his feelings about the press were to deteriorate further as he watched that night's edition of Hold The Back Page, Sky Sports' weekly round-table discussion, chaired by Brian Woolnough of the Sun. Keegan's selection of Gareth Southgate, the Aston Villa defender, to replace Gerrard had somehow leaked out, which itself annoyed Keegan, and Woolnough and his guests - Henry Winter of the Daily Telegraph, Oliver Holt of the Times and Steve Curry of the Sunday Times - laid into the decision with varying degrees of scorn. </p> <p>\"Defeat will be devastating for Keegan,\" the coach heard Woolnough pronounce. Holt accused him of lacking the \"bottle\" to make a decision between Michael Owen and Andy Cole and, apropos of the Gerrard business, of telling \"a stupid lie\". Curry observed: \"I ceased to be amazed by Kevin's selections long ago,\" while even the comparatively emollient Winter said: \"Maybe the stadium goes and the manager goes as well, and we have to have a clean break.\" </p> <p>The next day everything felt bad. London's weather seemed to have plunged straight from an unsatisfactory summer to a premature winter. There was drizzle in the air. At the stadium the multi-storey car-park charge had almost doubled overnight, from \u00a38 for Bob Dylan the previous evening to \u00a315 for England, hardly an accurate reflection of their relative significance. </p> <p>Wembley's stern old twin-towered fa\u00e7ade, upon which the nation was supposed to be gazing fondly for the last time, was virtually obliterated by banners advertising the team's chief sponsor, an insurance company. Inside the stadium the resident disc jockey rehearsed his usual inanities. When Russell Watson came on to bellow a Woolworth's version of Nessun Dorma, flanked by a couple of dribbling fountains, we were told that we were listening to \"one of the finest voices this country has ever produced\" - the sort of hyperbole that, applied to English footballers, has prefaced so many disappointments. </p> <p>When the two sets of players emerged from the tunnel for the formal pre-match presentation, they were led by Bobby Charlton and Franz Beckenbauer. This seemed a reminder not so much of England's victory in the 1966 World Cup final as of the far more recent humiliation at the hands of the Germans in the bidding to host the 2006 tournament, in which Charlton and Beckenbauer again went head to head. England were wearing red shirts and white shorts, as they had in the 1966 final, another indication of vulnerability since it suggested that they had more faith in the symbolic voodoo attached to a single event than in the integrity of a tradition embodied by the traditional white and blue. </p> <p>Germany, who had already played one qualifying match, against Greece, and had earned three points from it, were not looking for glory. \"We would have settled for a draw,\" Dietmar Hamann, their Liverpool midfielder, said this week. But once the game started it was immediately apparent that England had little to offer. After 13 minutes Paul Scholes lost the ball to Michael Ballack and reacted by fouling him in the centre of midfield, 30 yards from goal. Sensing England's slowness in getting themselves organised, Hamann took the free-kick quickly and hit a low but not particularly hard shot that bounced once and skidded past the left hand of the diving David Seaman. </p> <p>A few seconds after the restart Tony Adams, Keegan's captain, was pulling the 20-year-old Sebastian Deisler back by the shirt. Thoroughly dishevelled, the England players were giving the ball away with dismal regularity. \"Football is about confidence,\" Hamann said, \"and I think everybody could see what happened to England.\" Not until the 20th minute did a red-shirted player make a positive contribution to the match, when Cole deftly beat Marko Rehmer, only to be tripped and thereby offer David Beckham the chance to hit a 25-yard free-kick into Oliver Kahn's arms. </p> <p>By half-time England's plight was obvious - on and off the pitch. All around the ground fans were chanting \"Stand up if you won the war!\" or turning to the German supporters in the north-west corner, humming the Dam Busters March and making arm-waving gestures intended to evoke air raids. \"The chanting upset a lot of people in the royal box,\" a senior FA official said. \"There was a sense that something was going badly wrong.\" </p> <p>In the second half England made two chances, missed by Owen and Gareth Barry. \"We were able to sit back and let them come at us,\" Hamann said. \"It was a little easier for us.\" At the final whistle Keegan rose from the bench, shook hands with Rudi V\u00f6ller, his opposite number, and began the long, lonely walk across the pitch, leaving his staff to bring up the rear. As he neared the tunnel, he could hear the crowd's rancorous chant: \"What a load of rubbish!\" </p> <p>Normally he would have spoken to the TV reporters before entering the dressing room. This time he walked straight past them. Once the players had returned, he closed the door and broke the news that he would be resigning immediately. Some of them, led by Adams, tried to persuade him to stay, their arguments reinforced by Peter Beardsley and Arthur Cox, two of the old colleagues whom he had brought on to the coaching staff. But he was immovable. </p> <p>As the discussion continued, newspaper reporters were waiting for the managers to make their scheduled appearance in the press conference room and were sharpening their questions for the loser. V\u00f6ller arrived, expressed his pleasure at the performance and the result and left for the airport with his players. But there was no sign of Keegan. </p> <p>As time went by, the rumour spread that Adam Crozier, the FA's chief executive, and Noel White, the chairman of the international committee, had joined Keegan and the players in the dressing room - an event without precedent, so far as anyone could remember. </p> <p>In fact they had been accompanied by Geoff Thompson, the FA chairman, after Crozier had received an urgent summons on his mobile phone from Adrian Bevington, an FA press officer, half an hour after the final whistle. </p> <p>As they entered the dressing room and saw the players' faces, Keegan drew them aside and told them his decision. Quickly recognising his determination to go, they spent 10 minutes trying to talk him into delaying his departure for four more days, so that he could take the squad to Finland for the match on the following Wednesday. But they were no more successful than the players and coaches had been. </p> <p>Eventually, almost an hour after the end of the match, Crozier took Keegan to face the media, to whom he announced his decision in exactly the terms he had used with the players and officials. \"I just came up short,\" he said, admitting that, when things were going wrong on the pitch, he did not know how to put them right. </p> <p>When that ordeal was over, he collected his bags from the dressing room and went out to meet his FA car, in which his wife, Jean, and a couple of friends were waiting. Together they drove straight up to their home at Wynyard Hall, outside Newcastle. His 18-month, 18-match reign was over. </p> <p>The players, too, wandered out to the car park and went off in their various directions, spending the night at their homes before the scheduled return to Burnham Beeches the following evening. Cox, Beardsley, Derek Fazackerley, Ray Clemence, Les Reed and the rest of the coaching staff returned to the team hotel. Inside Wembley, however, Crozier, Thompson and White were trying to work out what to do next. </p> <p>Faced with the problem of a match in Helsinki on the Wednesday, they swiftly arrived at the only possible short-term solution. Howard Wilkinson, the FA's technical director, was asked to take temporary charge, as he had for one match after the sacking of Glenn Hoddle. No other possibility was seriously discussed. Then they too returned to Burnham, where they had dinner alongside the coaches. </p> <p>\"For a while,\" one of them said, \"people were talking about anything other than football. Everyone was in shock. We'd stood by him when the flak was flying after Euro 2000, because England had endured a lot of changes and we needed some consistency. </p> <p>\"And at that point he felt he had more to give. Then, suddenly, he hadn't. That was quite a change, in such a short period of time.\" </p> <p><strong> Call to Eriksson</strong><br> </p> <p> In Wembley's VIP lounge the news had spread quickly. Athole Still, an agent for footballers and opera singers, dialled a Rome number on his mobile phone and spoke to one of his clients, Sven-Goran Eriksson. A few days later a newspaper claimed that Still had been tipped off by Crozier and invited to contact the Lazio coach about the sudden vacancy. </p> <p>\"That's totally fanciful,\" Still said this week. \"There was no contact with any FA official. Obviously it was big news, and I just rang Sven to tell him what had happened. It was in the days thereafter that I started to wonder if they'd consider him. And until we went to Rome to do the deal, I'd never even met Adam Crozier.\" </p> <p>Eriksson's name was already on some minds as the FA officials reconvened at Burnham on the Sunday night and sat down to dinner together, this time to talk about the longer term. The players, too, had regathered, so the hotel was a little noisier than it had been the previous night. And the following morning they all set off for Helsinki. </p> <p>In terms of awfulness, the weekend's debacle was not to be compared to Bradford or Heysel or Hillsborough, where innocent people died simply because they had chosen to attend a football match. In just about every other sense, however, Saturday, October 7 was the worst day in the history of English football, a moment in time when all the arrogance and neglect of the past came together in one ghastly spluttering anti-climax, with a single small silver-haired figure standing alone at its centre. </p> <p>It was the day when Kevin Keegan took the blame and ran away and when, after decades of evasion, England finally confronted the truth about the value of heritage and tradition, which is that, although it is nice to have, it cannot be relied upon to provide the present with its meaning or the future with its inspiration. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>My trusty diary informs me that at the start of this week I arrived on Vancouver Island to overcast skies with a nasty hangover - the social life of Vancouver is incredibly hard to resist. The island, on the other hand, is a lot like England scenically, with rolling meadows, etc. </p> <p>I'd left myself a bit of time to explore so I headed for downtown Victoria. Feeling uninspired by the thought of shopping, I went to Crystal Gardens, a tropical building which has monkeys and the like. It was nothing fantastic, though the monkeys were very cute. </p> <p>Deciding to brave the rain - after all, I do come from England - I walked all the way down Douglas Street to the ocean. The sea was really wild and the bright sun in a grey sky made it look incredible, though eventually I was defeated by the extreme weather. </p> <p>While on the island, I was staying with another gap year student called Julia, who'd contacted me through the website. It was really nice to stay in a real house with a bunch of 18-year-old girls, just watching telly and having a laugh. </p> <p>However, I'd promised myself to do something the next day, and on the advice of a fellow hosteller, went to Butchart Gardens. By day they were nice - if you appreciate the whole garden thing - but by night they were incredible. The place was covered in lights and came alive like some sort of fantasy land. They also had some traditional carol singers, and for me this definitely felt like my Christmas away from home. If you can make it there (in the evening) I definitely recommend it - if you're full of Christmas spirit! </p> <p>That evening back at Julia's house we'd just finished watching a video when it started to snow. The five of us ran outside to play in it - I think everybody goes silly in snow. It was definitely one of those moments that will stick in my head, having snowball fights at midnight on Vancouver Island! </p> <p>I left the next day to enjoy my last few days back on the mainland. I can't really admit to having done anything cultural but you can't tell me that anybody spends all their time visiting their local museum? Well, I was enjoying myself anyhow, which has always been the most important feature of my travels. And I learnt a very good drinking game, which I will happily send the rules of to anyone who's interested! </p> <p>One point of interest was my very first taste of sushi. Me and a crazy Aussie hosteller, Lill, were shopping when we suddenly got brave and decided to give it a go. I'm not even a big cooked fish fan, so this was quite an achievement for me. I think everyone else in the restaurant thought we were nuts - for a start, their soup didn't come with spoons and it took us 10 minutes of watching everyone else to figure out how to drink it! Still, we passed an entertaining afternoon eating. My verdict: sushi is good, as long as it's the least intimidating variety. </p> <p>Something strange happened on the plane, heading for Honolulu. I was sat there drinking red wine, listening to Christina Aguilera and anticipating a good(ish) meal, when I had this overwhelming feeling of happiness. I just started thinking, I've had an amazing couple of weeks and now I'm sat on a plane bound for Hawaii. How lucky am I?? I think the people around me were probably a bit concerned, but I guess they just didn't understand! </p> <p>Unfortunately, things didn't stay good for long. It occurred to me at the airport that I'd made no attempt to book anywhere to stay, and it was now midnight. Eventually I got to a hostel, but the sight of it, and the ugliness of some of Waikiki at night was so different to Vancouver I just wanted to leave. I was woken up in the night by another girl coming into my room. She'd just got in from Rarotonga and said in comparison Honolulu was so big and ugly she wanted to cry. It was slightly comforting to know I wasn't alone in feeling like this. </p> <p>In the morning, I rejected the idea of sitting on Waikiki beach in favour of exploring the area on foot. Oahu isn't as ugly as I first thought. It has incredibly stunning parts, but there are so many horrible commercial parts that ruin it. </p> <p>Somehow in my wandering I got drawn into an art shop, and after talking to the owner for a little while he offered to show me round the island later, as I had no car of my own. The second I got into his car that evening, I wondered if I was doing the right thing. It turned out he was a nice guy, but going on tour with a stranger goes against everything I've ever been taught. Generally, my advice would be, \"don't\". </p> <p>Anyhow, I had a pretty nice evening, driving round the city and beyond at night. We finished up at the ridiculously rich Hilton Hawaiian Village for a drink. And I was told that I wouldn't be able to drink in America. </p> <p>The following day my English roommate Alison and I took the bus to the north shore, to the Bonzai Pipeline, which boasts some of the best surf in the world. We met two American guys who seemed pretty nice, so when Alison headed back to catch her flight I stayed. The two guys were staying at a hotel in Waikiki and the idea appealed to me, so I decided to crash there also. </p> <p>Before I go on, I'd like to offer a great bit of advice. Don't stay with people you don't know, however nice they seem. Get to know them first, and stick to hostels. They may be basic, but at least they're safe. </p> <p>As the evening went on, it transpired these two were fairly well into drugs of all varieties and I was now stuck with them for the night having not booked anywhere else. Anyhow, this isn't a part of my travels I particularly want to dwell on, so to cut a long story short, nothing bad happened to me, but I was pretty well scared and had got myself well into a situation I could have avoided.

      "bodyText": "My trusty diary informs me that at the start of this week I arrived on Vancouver Island to overcast skies with a nasty hangover - the social life of Vancouver is incredibly hard to resist. The island, on the other hand, is a lot like England scenically, with rolling meadows, etc. I'd left myself a bit of time to explore so I headed for downtown Victoria. Feeling uninspired by the thought of shopping, I went to Crystal Gardens, a tropical building which has monkeys and the like. It was nothing fantastic, though the monkeys were very cute. Deciding to brave the rain - after all, I do come from England - I walked all the way down Douglas Street to the ocean. The sea was really wild and the bright sun in a grey sky made it look incredible, though eventually I was defeated by the extreme weather. While on the island, I was staying with another gap year student called Julia, who'd contacted me through the website. It was really nice to stay in a real house with a bunch of 18-year-old girls, just watching telly and having a laugh. However, I'd promised myself to do something the next day, and on the advice of a fellow hosteller, went to Butchart Gardens. By day they were nice - if you appreciate the whole garden thing - but by night they were incredible. The place was covered in lights and came alive like some sort of fantasy land. They also had some traditional carol singers, and for me this definitely felt like my Christmas away from home. If you can make it there (in the evening) I definitely recommend it - if you're full of Christmas spirit! That evening back at Julia's house we'd just finished watching a video when it started to snow. The five of us ran outside to play in it - I think everybody goes silly in snow. It was definitely one of those moments that will stick in my head, having snowball fights at midnight on Vancouver Island! I left the next day to enjoy my last few days back on the mainland. I can't really admit to having done anything cultural but you can't tell me that anybody spends all their time visiting their local museum? Well, I was enjoying myself anyhow, which has always been the most important feature of my travels. And I learnt a very good drinking game, which I will happily send the rules of to anyone who's interested! One point of interest was my very first taste of sushi. Me and a crazy Aussie hosteller, Lill, were shopping when we suddenly got brave and decided to give it a go. I'm not even a big cooked fish fan, so this was quite an achievement for me. I think everyone else in the restaurant thought we were nuts - for a start, their soup didn't come with spoons and it took us 10 minutes of watching everyone else to figure out how to drink it! Still, we passed an entertaining afternoon eating. My verdict: sushi is good, as long as it's the least intimidating variety. Something strange happened on the plane, heading for Honolulu. I was sat there drinking red wine, listening to Christina Aguilera and anticipating a good(ish) meal, when I had this overwhelming feeling of happiness. I just started thinking, I've had an amazing couple of weeks and now I'm sat on a plane bound for Hawaii. How lucky am I?? I think the people around me were probably a bit concerned, but I guess they just didn't understand! Unfortunately, things didn't stay good for long. It occurred to me at the airport that I'd made no attempt to book anywhere to stay, and it was now midnight. Eventually I got to a hostel, but the sight of it, and the ugliness of some of Waikiki at night was so different to Vancouver I just wanted to leave. I was woken up in the night by another girl coming into my room. She'd just got in from Rarotonga and said in comparison Honolulu was so big and ugly she wanted to cry. It was slightly comforting to know I wasn't alone in feeling like this. In the morning, I rejected the idea of sitting on Waikiki beach in favour of exploring the area on foot. Oahu isn't as ugly as I first thought. It has incredibly stunning parts, but there are so many horrible commercial parts that ruin it. Somehow in my wandering I got drawn into an art shop, and after talking to the owner for a little while he offered to show me round the island later, as I had no car of my own. The second I got into his car that evening, I wondered if I was doing the right thing. It turned out he was a nice guy, but going on tour with a stranger goes against everything I've ever been taught. Generally, my advice would be, \"don't\". Anyhow, I had a pretty nice evening, driving round the city and beyond at night. We finished up at the ridiculously rich Hilton Hawaiian Village for a drink. And I was told that I wouldn't be able to drink in America. The following day my English roommate Alison and I took the bus to the north shore, to the Bonzai Pipeline, which boasts some of the best surf in the world. We met two American guys who seemed pretty nice, so when Alison headed back to catch her flight I stayed. The two guys were staying at a hotel in Waikiki and the idea appealed to me, so I decided to crash there also. Before I go on, I'd like to offer a great bit of advice. Don't stay with people you don't know, however nice they seem. Get to know them first, and stick to hostels. They may be basic, but at least they're safe. As the evening went on, it transpired these two were fairly well into drugs of all varieties and I was now stuck with them for the night having not booked anywhere else. Anyhow, this isn't a part of my travels I particularly want to dwell on, so to cut a long story short, nothing bad happened to me, but I was pretty well scared and had got myself well into a situation I could have avoided. It gave me a valuable lesson to be more cautious. There are too many weird people around - and a fairly strong drug presence in Honolulu at night. I returned to my original hostel as soon as I could the next morning, but it goes some way to explaining why I've not had time to write a report before now. Anyhow, that was the end of my week, and it certainly has felt like a long one. A week ago I was in snow, today I was swimming in the sea - I've experienced more than a little culture shock of late.

      "body": "<p>\"And every year at Christmas,\" says the guide on the backstage tour of Radio City Music Hall in New York, \"this is the setting for the famous Radio City Music Hall Living Nativity.\" We are in the wings of the \"Biggest Stage in the World\", in the fantastic art deco Manhattan venue created by the visionary entertainment mogul Roxy in the early 1930s. One of New York City's most cherished yuletide traditions is Radio City Music Hall's Christmas Show, featuring the world-famous dance troupe The Rockettes in red tunics with white fur trim, and culminating with the Living Nativity, a tableau starring live camels, donkeys and sheep. All the animals live at Radio City Music Hall in the weeks leading up to Christmas, and all of them are here to participate in a pious tribute to the birth of Christ. </p> <p>For this is no sleazy showbiz festival of kitsch, Radio City publicity explains. This is a sincere continuation of a tradition started by St Francis of Assisi in the small Italian town of Greccio in the 13th century. The saint, \"realising Christmas had lost its meaning for many in his day, pondered various ways of bringing the story closer to them. Then he had a wonderful idea - re-enact the nativity scene on Christmas Eve. That night, he had the crib bring Christmas to life for the people of that small town. This year, we hope our enactment of this timeless story will be a moving and memorable experience for you.\" </p> <p>The representation of the nativity in European art is closely connected to this popular tradition of creating a crib at home or in the local church. Artists from the 13th century onwards have painted the nativity for the same reason that Saint Francis was supposed to have created a tableau of the crib with a living ox and ass: to make us go all gooey. </p> <p>It's a long way from Manhattan to the Rode Klooster monastery in the forest of Soign\u00e9, outside Brussels, where the painter Hugo van der Goes retreated from the world in the late 15th century. Van der Goes was one of the greatest artists of the northern Renaissance but suffered from suicidal depression that made him the despair of the monks. Van der Goes's late painting The Adoration of the Shepherds (c1480), now in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie in Berlin, is the very opposite in spirit to Radio City's Living Nativity. A low, long panel, it represents the stable as a tiny, confined space. The baby in the crib is just off-centre, his flesh glowing, and Mary and Joseph pray to the child in the company of a host of tiny angels while the shepherds squeeze in, too. It is humble. Yet it is also theatre. </p> <p>This is a stage, a mystery theatre. At the sides are two figures who look directly at us, the audience, as they pull back a pair of curtains on a rail running across the top of the painting to reveal the manger. This picture is derived from the popular reenactments of the nativity: the tableau at Greccio, as well as the Shepherds' Plays that flourished in the lowlands at the time of Hugo van der Goes. </p> <p>Giotto's painting of the Institution of the Crib at Greccio, part of his fresco cycle of the Life of St Francis in Assisi executed at the end of the 13th century, emphasises the populist nature of the spectacle. St Francis lovingly holds the Christ child; there is a wooden crib, and next to it, a living baby ox and ass, sitting docilely as part of the show. All around, people are singing, the church is full. </p> <p>The representation of the nativity in art, including the scenes of the adoration of the shepherds and the adoration of the magi, is absolutely inseparable from these traditions of popular theatre. Botticelli's Mystic Nativity (1500) in the National Gallery presents us with a head-on view of the stable, a wood-and-straw loggia added on to the front of a cave, which you can't help comparing to a theatrical stage. Mystery plays were presented on little wooden stages temporarily tacked on to existing buildings in just this way. </p> <p>Yet, if the nativity in art is intimately connected to popular theatre, some of the most haunting paintings of this mystery turn away from the explicit, universally readable drama of popular art, to touch on more remote emotional resonances, a theatre of the mind. Leonardo da Vinci's sublime, unfinished Adoration of the Magi in the Uffizi, Florence, has a philosopher standing meditatively at the extreme left of the picture. But instead of announcing the nativity as a simple emotive scene, he tugs his chin, implying this is a matter for troubled thought. The ruins in the background are rendered in perfect mathematical perspective yet reduced to fragments, the remnants of a pagan world ruined by Christ's birth. In the background, horses rear. They are manifestations of animal passion and war, the strivings of empire - doomed by this moment when the old must die to make way for the new. The magi, dark-eyed and dumbstruck, know they are part of this old world. As T S Eliot has them say, \"this Birth was/Hard and bitter agony for us.\" </p> <p> The strangest, most beautiful paintings of the nativity induce this shudder, and if they start as theatre, they end somewhere deep inside our imagination. Piero della Francesca's Nativity (1470-5) in the National Gallery has been rendered all the more mysterious by damage over the years that has simplified its surface. Piero, like Leonardo, was an intellectual - he wrote on perspective - and his painting has a reserve that takes us far from the everyday world represented by Bethlehem to a place outside town, under a humble wooden shelter in a stark countryside, where angels have appeared to hymn this birth. There is a confident reality to the painting, established by Piero's brilliant grasp of perspective. But he uses his understanding of the new Renaissance science of representation to convince us, the learned and the unlearned, the shepherds and the magi, that something magical has happened. </p> <p>\"Paintings are placed in churches so that the illiterate can read on the walls what they cannot read in books,\" said Pope Gregory the Great. The nativity was especially suited to the Church's need to communicate. In Giotto's painting, St Francis handles the child like a mother. The nativity in Renaissance art makes men feel like mothers, mothers feel like Mary, unites everyone in tenderness for the divine baby. </p> <p>Yet the sincerity of these paintings has always been in conflict with another desire, to make the tableau that little bit more lavish than the one in the neighbouring village. The populist nature of the nativity and its connection to theatre mean it is always open to competitive, over-ornate types of spectacle; the pure goes hand-in-hand with the vulgar. You only have to look at Veronese's Adoration of the Kings (1573) at the National Gallery to see how elaborate and extravagant nativity scenes could get. Born in a stable? No way, you can hear Veronese's affluent Venetian audience saying. The wooden theatre-like \"stable\" here is just an afterthought to the classical ruin that dominates the painting. Veronese's Christ is born in a palace, albeit a wrecked one. His mother is dressed in silk every bit as fine as the robes of the kings who have come to pay devotion. She does not sit next to a humble manger but is raised up high, royally, with the crowd bowing down before her. Even the ox looks aristocratic. </p> <p>The classical ruins in Veronese's painting appear again and again in nativity scenes and are generally interpreted as an allusion to the decline of the classical world. The birth of Christ signifies the death of the Roman empire, the birth of a new age. Although this surely is their emblematic meaning, the ruins in Veronese's painting are also enjoyed for their own sake. It was the Renaissance, after all. In the humblest nativity paintings, the stable is a hut; in the grandest, it is an architectural feast, and the gold vessels presented as gifts by the wise men, and the fine clothes they wear, and their retinue of servants, are flamboyantly tacky. The Living Nativity at Radio City Music Hall really can claim to be in a great tradition.</p>",

      "body": "<p>As chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), I was alarmed by William Hague's dramatic u-turn on the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence, now claiming it to have damaged police morale and prevented police from effective use of stop and search powers, thus causing a rise in street crime.</p> <p>It is unhelpful to suggest that a fall in stop and search has been directly responsible for a rise in street crime. Pre-Macpherson, the majority of stop and searches did not lead to an arrest, and many that did were for minor offences. Post-Macpherson, the use of stop and search is being used in a much more sensitive and focused way.</p> <p>Police are much more concerned with the quality of stop and search, rather than the quantity. Carrying out 100 random stops and searches is pointless. Carrying out 10 that are carefully targeted and result in high-quality arrests is much more meaningful. The use of this power in this way will also find support from the community, as will the abandonment of the disproportionate stopping and searching of black and Asian people. It is criminal intent and not the colour of your skin that should interest the patrolling police officer.</p> <p>On crime, the biggest concern for Londoners as identified in the Met's public attitude survey is burglary. The Met has worked hard to tackle this deplorable crime with a good deal of success. Burglaries are down more than 9% this year. Figures this low haven't been seen since 1979. Similarly, the Met has had some good results in its big push against crimes involving class A drugs. In the past few weeks, raids across London have produced 323 arrests and large seizures of drugs, guns and stolen property.</p> <p>In terms of so-called \"volume crime\", the area which is currently causing most concern is street robbery, particularly the number of robberies involving young people and mobile phones. This is a relatively new phenomenon and shows how the police can face sudden new pressures on time and resources. Tackling street crime is not a matter merely for police. There are many other factors involved which we, as a community, need to think about and work towards solving.</p> <p>One way of deterring street robberies is to divert youngsters away from crime and into other activities which will help them lead productive lives, achieving their full potential.

      "bodyText": "As chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA), I was alarmed by William Hague's dramatic u-turn on the Macpherson report into the death of Stephen Lawrence, now claiming it to have damaged police morale and prevented police from effective use of stop and search powers, thus causing a rise in street crime. It is unhelpful to suggest that a fall in stop and search has been directly responsible for a rise in street crime. Pre-Macpherson, the majority of stop and searches did not lead to an arrest, and many that did were for minor offences. Post-Macpherson, the use of stop and search is being used in a much more sensitive and focused way. Police are much more concerned with the quality of stop and search, rather than the quantity. Carrying out 100 random stops and searches is pointless. Carrying out 10 that are carefully targeted and result in high-quality arrests is much more meaningful. The use of this power in this way will also find support from the community, as will the abandonment of the disproportionate stopping and searching of black and Asian people. It is criminal intent and not the colour of your skin that should interest the patrolling police officer. On crime, the biggest concern for Londoners as identified in the Met's public attitude survey is burglary. The Met has worked hard to tackle this deplorable crime with a good deal of success. Burglaries are down more than 9% this year. Figures this low haven't been seen since 1979. Similarly, the Met has had some good results in its big push against crimes involving class A drugs. In the past few weeks, raids across London have produced 323 arrests and large seizures of drugs, guns and stolen property. In terms of so-called \"volume crime\", the area which is currently causing most concern is street robbery, particularly the number of robberies involving young people and mobile phones. This is a relatively new phenomenon and shows how the police can face sudden new pressures on time and resources. Tackling street crime is not a matter merely for police. There are many other factors involved which we, as a community, need to think about and work towards solving. One way of deterring street robberies is to divert youngsters away from crime and into other activities which will help them lead productive lives, achieving their full potential. Truancy, bullying and the connection between school exclusions and crime - all need to be looked at. But we are still facing huge problems. In fact, the Metropolitan Police is facing its worst crisis in its 170-year history. We need about 3,000 more police officers to police London effectively, in order to ensure that estates like the one in Peckham where Damilola Taylor was so tragically killed are regularly patrolled on foot by police officers who know their beats and know who lives there.

      "body": "<p>It was just a year ago, on a freezing day in Helsinki, that the European Union formally adopted Turkey as a candidate for membership, over 30 years after it first applied to join. But since then there have been many painful reminders that relations between Brussels and Ankara are never going to be easy.</p> <p>Only this week the bloody suppression of rioting in Turkish prisons brought criticism from the European commission, as well as - literally - high-profile protests from Kurdish demonstrators who occupied two pods on the London Eye on the south bank of the Thames. Unrelated to that, EU ministers approved a three-year, \u00a380m grant to help Turkey prepare for eventual membership by promoting economic and social development.</p> <p>And just a few days earlier, the European court of human rights [ECHR] in Strasbourg formally decided that Abdullah Ocalan, head of the banned Kurdish Workers' Party or PKK, had the right to appeal against his death sentence.</p> <p>To national delight, Ocalan was kidnapped by Turkish agents in Kenya last year and brought home to stand trial for his role in the country's bloody 16-year separatist war. The ECHR is not part of the EU, but all members of the Council of Europe, including Turkey, are bound by its decisions.</p> <p>Like the 12 other countries currently seeking to join the union, from Estonia to Malta, and Slovakia to Cyprus, Turkey has to meet a rigorous set of economic, legal and political criteria. But the changes it must make before membership talks can even start under a so-called \"accession partnership accord\" are in many ways much tougher than for others - because of the sheer scale of its problems.</p> <p>With a population of 63m people, mostly Muslims (and the unstated, though very real, assumptions of racism or prejudice that go with that), Turkey is by far the largest of all the candidate countries, though not the poorest (in GDP terms it is ahead of Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Latvia). Euro-barometer polls show that more people in the current 15 member states oppose its candidacy than that of any other country.</p> <p>If it were to join the EU today, it would be second only in influence to Germany, with whom its relations (dominated by issues of gastarbeiter and migrants) have always been surly. If it were to join in 20 years or so, according to current population trends, it would be the biggest and most powerful of 28 member states. Optimistic Turks say they could be in by 2010.</p> <p>Others think, frankly, that they will never actually make it into this \"Christian club\".

      "bodyText": "It was just a year ago, on a freezing day in Helsinki, that the European Union formally adopted Turkey as a candidate for membership, over 30 years after it first applied to join. But since then there have been many painful reminders that relations between Brussels and Ankara are never going to be easy. Only this week the bloody suppression of rioting in Turkish prisons brought criticism from the European commission, as well as - literally - high-profile protests from Kurdish demonstrators who occupied two pods on the London Eye on the south bank of the Thames. Unrelated to that, EU ministers approved a three-year, \u00a380m grant to help Turkey prepare for eventual membership by promoting economic and social development. And just a few days earlier, the European court of human rights [ECHR] in Strasbourg formally decided that Abdullah Ocalan, head of the banned Kurdish Workers' Party or PKK, had the right to appeal against his death sentence. To national delight, Ocalan was kidnapped by Turkish agents in Kenya last year and brought home to stand trial for his role in the country's bloody 16-year separatist war. The ECHR is not part of the EU, but all members of the Council of Europe, including Turkey, are bound by its decisions. Like the 12 other countries currently seeking to join the union, from Estonia to Malta, and Slovakia to Cyprus, Turkey has to meet a rigorous set of economic, legal and political criteria. But the changes it must make before membership talks can even start under a so-called \"accession partnership accord\" are in many ways much tougher than for others - because of the sheer scale of its problems. With a population of 63m people, mostly Muslims (and the unstated, though very real, assumptions of racism or prejudice that go with that), Turkey is by far the largest of all the candidate countries, though not the poorest (in GDP terms it is ahead of Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania and Latvia). Euro-barometer polls show that more people in the current 15 member states oppose its candidacy than that of any other country. If it were to join the EU today, it would be second only in influence to Germany, with whom its relations (dominated by issues of gastarbeiter and migrants) have always been surly. If it were to join in 20 years or so, according to current population trends, it would be the biggest and most powerful of 28 member states. Optimistic Turks say they could be in by 2010. Others think, frankly, that they will never actually make it into this \"Christian club\". Uniquely, Turkey's candidacy is a problem for an existing EU member - Greece - despite a thaw in relations last year, Athens rarely misses an opportunity to make life difficult for its historic enemy. Problems over Cyprus and the Aegean loom as large as ever. Insistence by Greece on including references to these issues in the terms for Turkey's accession partnership last month brought a furious response from prime minister Bulent Ecevit, who accused the EU of \"deceiving\" him over what had been agreed in Helsinki. If the EU wants a just solution to the Aegean dispute, the way for that is not bowing to Greece's caprices but \"...a civilised dialogue with Turkey,\" he complained. And his foreign minister, Ismail Cem, went undiplomatically further, accusing the EU of behaving like \"colonial governors\" by setting offensive new conditions for membership. Matters were not helped by the fact that the European parliament had just approved a resolution formally accusing Turks of genocide against the Armenians 85 years ago - another hardy perennial of this deeply troubled relationship. The Ocalan case will be in suspension until a ruling on his appeal, probably next summer. But the Turkish elite, at least, already understands well enough that resolving what is euphemistically called the \"south-eastern problem\" is essential to EU membership. In one encouraging sign recently, a powerful army chief signalled that he could accept Kurdish-language broadcasts - a key demand by Brussels. Hanging Ocalan would be a severe, perhaps mortal, blow.

Ankara, where the suspicious and powerful military establishment still plays a central role, has steadfastly refused to drop its opposition to the EU's nascent rapid reaction force - intended to mount limited operations when Nato is not involved. The problem here is that Turkey, with the second largest army in the Atlantic alliance, does not want to give the green light to a force which it fears, however unrealistically, may one day operate in its own backyard.

      "bodyText": "Senior BBC News executives Richard Sambrook and Roger Mosey are the hot favourites in the race to replace Tony Hall as BBC News director. The formal battle to clinch one of the most prestigious positions in the BBC began today with reports that Mr Hall had decided to leave after 30 years. An announcement had been expected this afternoon following weeks of negotiations about a new job as the Royal Opera House's chief executive. However, any announcement is likely to be delayed until after Christmas as the two sides are still \"haggling over the details\", according to sources. Mr Hall's job as guardian of the corporation's editorial standards and independence is seen as a key role and is likely to go to an insider. It is not yet clear whether Mr Hall will depart before the general election, which is likely in the spring. Mr Sambrook is deputy director of BBC News and is highly regarded by journalists. He has also won the ear of director general Greg Dyke. A former head of BBC newsgathering, Mr Sambrook was acting director of sport for several months this year before Peter Salmon took the job - a sign that he is seen by Mr Dyke as a trusted lieutenant. Mr Mosey, as head of TV news, has been heavily involved in the recent move of the BBC1 Nine O'Clock News to 10pm. He made his name as editor of the Today programme and before taking up his post in television, was former controller of Radio 5 Live, one of the BBC's biggest success stories of recent years. Other names in the frame include ITV's head of current affairs Steve Anderson, Nigel Dacre, editor of ITV's news programmes at ITN, CNN International boss Chris Cramer - a former BBC executive - and Sky News boss Nick Pollard.",

      "bodyText": "Richard Sambrook's rise to be BBC News deputy director and now a leading contender for the top news job may cause raised eyebrows outside the corporation, but insiders are well aware of his management pedigree and capabilities. As too, apparently, is BBC director general Greg Dyke, who asked Mr Sambrook to baby-sit the director of sport job for six months earlier this year. Mr Sambrook earned his BBC management spurs during a three-and-a-half year stint as head of newsgathering. Running newsgathering, which involves managing the BBC's vast network of field producers and reporters and negotiating news supply deals with the agencies and other broadcasters, is not as glamorous or high profile as other management roles within BBC News. The head of TV or radio news programmes, for instance, can expect to be in the media spotlight every time a controversy blows up around Newsnight or Today. But the head of newsgathering plays a vital role - and arguably the most powerful within BBC News - in feeding stories to the beast that is the BBC's array of news networks and bulletins. Mr Sambrook joined the BBC in 1980 as a radio news subeditor, before switching to TV news. He rose through the ranks as a producer and programme editor, before taking over as head of newsgathering in June 1996. He took up his current job in December last year. But Mr Sambrook is not the sort of TV executive you find hanging around the Groucho. He is more likely to be swapping war stories with TV news mates over a pint in the local BBC boozer. Grammar-school educated with an English degree from Reading University, Mr Sambrook is regarded as a no-nonsense, down-to-earth character with a dry, self-deprecating sense of humour. But those who know him suggest that behind his affable exterior Mr Sambrook is more ambitious than he lets on. The quiet man of BBC News should not be underestimated.",

      "bodyText": "Detectives investigating the murder of Damilola Taylor have issued an urgent appeal for a potentially key witness to come forward. The witness has already contacted police through the confidential Crimestoppers telephone service - but did not leave contact details. He or she - police are not even certain of the witness's gender - claims to have seen 10-year-old Damilola arguing with a group of youths just minutes before he was killed. The informant was visiting London at the time and made the new claim in a call to Crimestoppers in Scotland. Detective Superintendent David Dillnut said the caller claims to have seen Damilola near the Peckham leisure centre. \"The person described seeing him with two black boys who were arguing with Damilola. A third youth was called over by the first two youths,\" said Det Supt Dillnut. According to Sky News, police know the identity of Damilola's killer and are attempting to assemble a case, pending new witnesses, before any arrests are made. Meanwhile, the inquiry team has released a 15-year-old boy on police bail, after arresting him in connection with the November 27 murder. He is the 13th suspect to be questioned. Police appeals for the anonymous informant and other witnesses to come forward were coupled with assurances that they would receive police protection. The appeals were echoed by Althea Smith, of the Southwark police and community consultative group. She made a moving plea for local people to remember Damilola's mother, Gloria. \"Just imagine, three days to go to Christmas - how would you feel as a parent to feel you have lost someone who is so close to you? \"Think about on Christmas morning how it will feel for Gloria to look under the Christmas tree at presents for Damilola, but there's no Damilola,\" she said.

      "bodyText": "The full circumstances of how Hello! magazine managed to snatch pictures of Catherine Zeta-Jones'wedding despite an exclusive deal with rival publication OK! have been revealed for the first time. The photographer who took unauthorised snaps of the wedding of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones was Phil Ramey, a \"well-known Californian paparazzo\". Up to now the source of the photographs remained a mystery with conflicting stories suggesting the footage was either from a video camera or from a hotel worker or guest. And it is the identity of the photographer that yesterday paved the way for Mr and Mrs Douglas to sue Hello! magazine for breach of privacy under the new European Human Rights Act incorporated into British law in October. \"The Human Rights Act 1998 requires the courts in this country to give appropriate effect to the right to respect for private and family life set out in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms,\" said the court yesterday. It went on to explain that Mr Ramey was not a guest of the bride and groom. This was the key factor in the decision to allow Ms Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas to sue Hello!. \"The reason why it is material to this case is that on the present evidence it is possible that the photographer was an intruder with whom no relationship of trust has been established,\" the ruling continued. \"If it was a guest or an employee, the received law of confidence is probably all the claimants needed.\" Hello! owner Eduaordo Sanchez told the court said he had not commissioned the photographs, financed them or agreed a price for them in advance. However, they were bought by the magazine from an agency which was selling the global rights to them. The full 78-page judgement also states that Hello! offered three times the eventual sum paid by OK! to the couple for worldwide rights. It also reveals how desperate OK! was to protect its exclusive rights because of plans for an upcoming flotation of Northern &amp; Shell publishing. The Court of Appeal ruling adds that on the day the injunction was sought \"nine low-resolution photos of the wedding had been faxed to OK! from Holland; OK! had been told the photos were by Phil Ramey, a well-known Californian paparazzo; that copies of Hello! were already in the United Kingdom with a photo of the wedding on the front and would be distributed very shortly.\" And the ruling details the intense security proceedings organised by Mr Douglas and Ms Zeta-Jones to protect their exclusive contract, suggesting that smuggling video footage out of the wedding must have been impossible. \"Mr Ashford [Paul Ashford, editorial director of OK! and now of Express Newspapers] described a sophisticated large-scale operation, planned with military precision, to try to ensure that no other media reporting took place. \"Security personnel saw someone with a camera on about six occasions during the reception. They immediately confiscated the camera and took the film out of it, thereby exposing the film and destroying any photographs that might have been taken.\" It also emerged in yesterday's court ruling that OK! had secured syndication deals worth \u00a3750,000 for the wedding pictures. The appeal judges found that Hello! had caused OK! to be in breach of contract by publishing the unauthorised pictures, which led to the termination of several of these rights deals. Northern &amp; Shell \"received numerous telephone calls and emails from licensees threatening to terminate the licence as a result of those unauthorised photos being published\", the ruling noted. The ruling also contains the appeal judges' ruling on a statement by Martin Ellice, marketing manager for Northern &amp; Shell, claiming that Hello! had brought its print deadlines forward to accommodate the snatched photographs.",

Morton won a best supporting actress Oscar nomination without saying a word and manages to create a whole personality with looks and gestures without a hint of showiness (along with Emily Watson, Morton seems on a whole different emotional plane from other British actresses).

For these would contribute to a kind of Christmas society which really would be a cause for rejoicing. \u0095 Bob Holman is the author of Kids at the Door Revisited, Russell House Publishing, 2000.",

      "bodyText": "Media lawyers have hailed yesterday's landmark court ruling on Hello! magazine's illicit pictures of Catherine Zeta Jones' wedding as the first \"step in the direction of establishing a privacy law in the UK\". The judgement is the first to uphold a right to privacy under English law since the new Human Rights Act came into force in October. And legal experts said it could eventually give celebrities recourse to legal action over unwelcome attention from newspapers and magazines. In a landmark ruling, appeal court judges said celebrities as well as members of the public should have a right to seek damages if their privacy was invaded. Chris Hutchins, the solicitor acting for Hello! magazine, said the ruling \"established that there is a case for celebrities to claim a right to privacy\". Intellectual property specialist lawyer Margaret Briffa said the ruling was \"very very important, in that it gives celebrities permission to pursue damages for invasion of privacy\". In the ruling, Lord Justices Brooke, Sedley and Keene noted that Mr Douglas and Ms Zeta-Jones had seized six cameras at the wedding in an attempt to protect their exclusive deal with OK! Lawyers acting for Hello! had argued that they had practiced similar tactics to those employed by OK! at the wedding of Gloria Hunniford, for which Hello! had paid for exclusive rights. But the appeal judges ruled that Ms Hunniford had not taken such steps to protect her privacy and the exclusivity of the photographs, noting that guests had been issued with disposable cameras. The original ruling was made on November 23 when Appeal Court judges lifted a temporary injunction granted to OK! which prevented Hello! from publishing snatched photographs of the wedding of Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones. OK! was granted a temporary injunction preventing copies of Hello! being sold. However the full 78-page statement was only released yesterday. The Appeal Court judges lifted the injunction because they felt that it was not an appropriate way to stop publication.",

      "body": "<p>Hey, America, maybe you don't want to know this, but Al Gore just increased his majority in the election that George W Bush won.</p> <p>The latest figures, published yesterday, show that Gore got 50,996,064 votes on November 7. George W got 50,456,167. That gives Gore a majority of 539,897 votes over Bush.</p> <p>Pretty close election, eh? Sure, but not that close when you actually look at the figures. Don't slip into the mistake of calling it \"America's closest ever election\", because it wasn't. Kennedy beat Nixon by 114,673 in 1960. That's what you call a close one. And Nixon beat Humphrey by 510,645 in 1968.</p> <p>So in fact the 2000 contest was America's third closest election of modern times. The big difference was that Kennedy got to be president when he won narrowly, and so did Nixon. Gore's bigger win in the popular vote didn't win him the White House, as we all know.</p> <p>The possibility of a president winning the popular vote but losing the electoral college is built into the American system. Sometimes, as we know, it happens. Like it did in 1824, when the new president was beaten by 38,149 in the popular vote. Or in 1876 when the president was 254,235 behind his rival. Or in 1888, when the winner lost by 90,956.</p> <p>To which now add the year 2000, when the winner, Bush, lost the popular vote by 539,897, or by double the number of votes that anyone else has lost by and still become president. Or, to put it another way, lost by more than the total number of people who voted in the state of Idaho. Or all those who voted in Vermont and Wyoming put together. Or the votes in Alaska and the District of Columbia combined.</p> <p>Or, to put it yet another way, Gore defeated Bush by a majority almost exactly the size of Austin, Texas, a city with 541,000 inhabitants. No, this wasn't the closest American election of all time. It was simply the most unfair.</p> <p>\"There's been a concession speech,\" someone pointed out this week to people like me. \"There's been a declared victor. We even got the United States supreme court to intervene in it, which is a pretty historic thing. The election's over.\"</p> <p>That was Jeb Bush speaking. The Florida governor had just certified the 25 electoral college votes from his state which gave the presidency to his brother by 271 to 266 for Gore (one woman from DC refused to vote for Gore in protest at the capital city's lack of voting rights in the US Congress).</p> <p>Jeb was angry with several newspapers and news organisations from Florida and elsewhere, who are making plans to study some of the 180,000 Florida \"undervotes\" that never did get counted when the US supreme court conservatives handed the election to brother Dubya.</p> <p>\"Go ahead and do it, but is that going to rewrite history? I don't think so,\" the Florida governor said. \"Should it rewrite history? No. We're a nation of laws and the rule of law prevails.</p> <p>We're still waiting for word of how the statewide vote check is going to be conducted.

      "bodyText": "Hey, America, maybe you don't want to know this, but Al Gore just increased his majority in the election that George W Bush won. The latest figures, published yesterday, show that Gore got 50,996,064 votes on November 7. George W got 50,456,167. That gives Gore a majority of 539,897 votes over Bush. Pretty close election, eh? Sure, but not that close when you actually look at the figures. Don't slip into the mistake of calling it \"America's closest ever election\", because it wasn't. Kennedy beat Nixon by 114,673 in 1960. That's what you call a close one. And Nixon beat Humphrey by 510,645 in 1968. So in fact the 2000 contest was America's third closest election of modern times. The big difference was that Kennedy got to be president when he won narrowly, and so did Nixon. Gore's bigger win in the popular vote didn't win him the White House, as we all know. The possibility of a president winning the popular vote but losing the electoral college is built into the American system. Sometimes, as we know, it happens. Like it did in 1824, when the new president was beaten by 38,149 in the popular vote. Or in 1876 when the president was 254,235 behind his rival. Or in 1888, when the winner lost by 90,956. To which now add the year 2000, when the winner, Bush, lost the popular vote by 539,897, or by double the number of votes that anyone else has lost by and still become president. Or, to put it another way, lost by more than the total number of people who voted in the state of Idaho. Or all those who voted in Vermont and Wyoming put together. Or the votes in Alaska and the District of Columbia combined. Or, to put it yet another way, Gore defeated Bush by a majority almost exactly the size of Austin, Texas, a city with 541,000 inhabitants. No, this wasn't the closest American election of all time. It was simply the most unfair. \"There's been a concession speech,\" someone pointed out this week to people like me. \"There's been a declared victor. We even got the United States supreme court to intervene in it, which is a pretty historic thing. The election's over.\" That was Jeb Bush speaking. The Florida governor had just certified the 25 electoral college votes from his state which gave the presidency to his brother by 271 to 266 for Gore (one woman from DC refused to vote for Gore in protest at the capital city's lack of voting rights in the US Congress). Jeb was angry with several newspapers and news organisations from Florida and elsewhere, who are making plans to study some of the 180,000 Florida \"undervotes\" that never did get counted when the US supreme court conservatives handed the election to brother Dubya. \"Go ahead and do it, but is that going to rewrite history? I don't think so,\" the Florida governor said. \"Should it rewrite history? No. We're a nation of laws and the rule of law prevails. We're still waiting for word of how the statewide vote check is going to be conducted. But when Chief Justice William (\"Christ, he's way to the right of Pat Buchanan\" - HR Haldeman, 1971) Rehnquist and his conservative majority stopped the clock on the Florida counting, Bush's lead over Gore there was down to 154. Since then, though, there have been fresh figures from two counties. An examination of the uncounted votes in Lake County, a heavily republican county in central Florida, has concluded that Gore should have had a further 130 votes there which were never properly counted. Meanwhile, a separate re-examination exercise in Broward county, sponsored by the Miami Herald, has completed examining 871 out of 6,800 local ballots that were not included in the official Broward hand recount last month. So far, according to the Palm Beach Post, checkers have found 203 potential new Gore votes and 39 potential new Bush votes. So, after looking at about 1% of the votes which Chief Justice \"Way to the right\" Rehnquist ordered to be cut from the election, the current overall total in Florida shows Gore 140 votes ahead. Or, to put it another way, Bush wins again. Email martin.kettle@theguardian.com Related special reports US election race Gun violence in America Interactive quiz Do you know your Bushisms?

He has managed to persuade everybody that his subject was charming, witty and above all, right, whereas he was of course an appalling blot on humanity whose ideas pauperised millions for most of the last century.\" Meanwhile<strong> London: the Biography</strong> drew plaudits from Steven Berkoff, who felt that Peter Ackroyd showed London as \"a living, breathing creature, greedy, bestial, even demonic\" (Observer). Another demonic old beast, Alan Clark, enjoyed a posthumous smirk as the second part of his diaries, <strong> Into Politics</strong>, was published. Robert Harris called it an \"elongated Etonian drawl of selfishness, lechery, snobbishness, hypochondria, self-delusion and melancholy transformed by the razor quality of Clark's prose and his reckless honesty\" (Observer). </p> <p><strong> Debut novels</strong> </p> <p>The first novel from wunderkind Zadie Smith, <strong> White Teeth</strong>, may have missed the Orange prize but it scooped the Guardian First Book Award.

      "bodyText": "Biography Francis Wheen's Karl Marx: A Life found an unlikely fan in Boris Johnson. In the Daily Telegraph, the Spectator editor enjoyed a pleasantly double-edged gush: \"I take my hat off to Francis Wheen... He has managed to persuade everybody that his subject was charming, witty and above all, right, whereas he was of course an appalling blot on humanity whose ideas pauperised millions for most of the last century.\" Meanwhile London: the Biography drew plaudits from Steven Berkoff, who felt that Peter Ackroyd showed London as \"a living, breathing creature, greedy, bestial, even demonic\" (Observer). Another demonic old beast, Alan Clark, enjoyed a posthumous smirk as the second part of his diaries, Into Politics, was published. Robert Harris called it an \"elongated Etonian drawl of selfishness, lechery, snobbishness, hypochondria, self-delusion and melancholy transformed by the razor quality of Clark's prose and his reckless honesty\" (Observer). Debut novels The first novel from wunderkind Zadie Smith, White Teeth, may have missed the Orange prize but it scooped the Guardian First Book Award.

Only the most cynical could doubt his sincerity, as he has complained for years about feeling constrained by Blur's poppy parameters. He is clearly following his heart (and, wincingly, has adopted black slang to go with it, leading bassist Alex James to call him \"the blackest man in west London\"), but the thought occurs that there are people better qualified to give overviews of a continent Albarn had never visited until four months ago. Unfortunately, they are mainly broadcasters like Andy Kershaw and Charlie Gillett, who lack Albarn's mass appeal. </p> <p>He's showing signs of rootsitis, a syndrome suffered by rock stars who've had the fame and the hits, but crave deeper validation, in the way that movie stars such as Nicole Kidman will do a West End play for next to no money because theatre is somehow more \"real\" than film.

      "body": "<p>Adrian Henri, who has died aged 68, was perhaps best known as a poet, though he was primarily a painter, as evidenced in a recent retrospective at Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery. But it was as a communicator, in the broadest sense of the word, that he made his greatest impact, both on those around him and on the cultural scene generally.</p> <p>Born in Birkenhead, Henri grew up through the war years in Rhyl. He was educated at St Asaph grammar school, in north Wales, before studying fine art, from 1951 to 1955, at King's College, Newcastle, where tutors included Lawrence Gowring, Roger de Gray and, later, Richard Hamilton. The influence of the abstract expressionists, and then the newly-emergent pop painters, was evident in his work by the early 1960s, but already it had a personal signature to it, an affection for the urban landscapes and icons of popular culture of his immediate surroundings.</p> <p>Jasper Johns's American Flag gave way to Omo packets, and Alfred Jarry's P\u00e8re Ubu was pictured strolling down Lime Street. In a homage to James Ensor, The Entry Of Christ Into Brussels became The Entry Of Christ Into Liverpool - with all of the Henri heroes and friends crowding the foreground, and Jesus on a donkey at the rear. Adrian was a confirmed atheist.</p> <p>It was at this time that I first met him. To a 16-year-old discovering jazz, modern art and the beat generation writers, his enormous enthusiasm acted as a catalyst in my own development - as it did for many others. It was directly as a result of this meeting - I was working two stalls down from him in a summer vacation job on Rhyl fairground - that I got involved in the increasingly populist bohemia emerging in Liverpool. He helped organise various multi-media events and happenings that, as well as being extensions to his paintings inspired by the New York artist Allan Kaprow, also triggered his performance-driven poetry.</p> <p>Alongside that of the other so-called Liverpool poets, this resulted in the Liverpool Scene anthology, edited by Edward Lucie-Smith, then (with Roger McGough and Brian Patten) the Penguin Modern Poets' Mersey Sound, which remains one of the best-selling poetry collections of all time.</p> <p>Adrian's poems were very much those of a painter; he wrote what he saw, as much as what he felt, though what he described was often expressed with such passion that even the most simplistic listings of people or places were lit with an emotional glow. \"I want to paint/ Pictures worth their weight in money/ Pictures that tramps can live in/ Pictures that children would find in their stocking on Christmas morning/ Pictures that teenage lovers can send each other/ I want to paint/ pictures.\"</p> <p>Despite the media attention spotlighting his poetry activity, and an increasingly hectic working life as a performer - not least as frontman with the touring rock/ poetry band, the Liverpool Scene (with whom I played saxophone) - Adrian never stopped painting throughout the 1960s, a period that culminated in his winning a major prize at the John Moores Liverpool Exhibition of 1972.</p> <p>The prizewinning work was one of the last of a celebrated series of \"Meat Paintings\", which marked a turning point in both his art and personal life. After a heart attack, he had adopted a more relaxed lifestyle and an increasingly lyrical approach in his painting, with rural landscapes and hedgerows taking over from the hard edges of pop art and photorealism.</p> <p>Of course, Adrian's role as communicator had never been restricted to words and canvases; from his post-student days he had taught at schools, colleges of further education and, most notably, at Liverpool College of Art. Through the 1970s and 1980s, he enjoyed lectureships at polytechnics around the country, writers' tours for the Arts Council and a number of writer-in-residence appointments.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the one-man exhibitions continued, and the poetry books proliferated. His art and poetry became known worldwide, and exhibition openings and reading tours took him across the globe, from America to South Africa, each place becoming a source of inspiration for paint and words, be it Monet's garden at Giverny or the white-walled suburbs of Los Angeles. His energies extended to stage plays, children's books and television plays.</p> <p>In all this activity, it was Adrian's character that others warmed to. He was eclectic, tolerant and generous of spirit, and happy to mention influences as diverse as James Ensor, Nicholas de Sta\u00ebl, Jasper Johns and Mark Rothko in the same breath - or, in the case of Me, in the same poem. And he could be just as excited about the work of those around him, whose paintings, poetry or whatever he would promote with an enthusiasm sometimes bordering on the evangelical.</p> <p>Nearly two years ago Adrian suffered a severe stroke from which he would never properly recover, despite a dogged determination to walk, talk and paint again - aided, in no small way, by his partner of the last 15 years, Catherine Marcangeli. He did indeed start drawing again. There was the Walker Gallery retrospective and, only last week, an exhibition of paintings opened in Rhyl. The night before his death, Liverpool city council conferred the freedom of the city on him.</p> <p>Catherine survives him.</p> <p><b>Nell Dunn writes:</b> Adrian Henri was a free spirit in the tradition of Byron and Shelley.

      "bodyText": "Adrian Henri, who has died aged 68, was perhaps best known as a poet, though he was primarily a painter, as evidenced in a recent retrospective at Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery. But it was as a communicator, in the broadest sense of the word, that he made his greatest impact, both on those around him and on the cultural scene generally. Born in Birkenhead, Henri grew up through the war years in Rhyl. He was educated at St Asaph grammar school, in north Wales, before studying fine art, from 1951 to 1955, at King's College, Newcastle, where tutors included Lawrence Gowring, Roger de Gray and, later, Richard Hamilton. The influence of the abstract expressionists, and then the newly-emergent pop painters, was evident in his work by the early 1960s, but already it had a personal signature to it, an affection for the urban landscapes and icons of popular culture of his immediate surroundings. Jasper Johns's American Flag gave way to Omo packets, and Alfred Jarry's P\u00e8re Ubu was pictured strolling down Lime Street. In a homage to James Ensor, The Entry Of Christ Into Brussels became The Entry Of Christ Into Liverpool - with all of the Henri heroes and friends crowding the foreground, and Jesus on a donkey at the rear. Adrian was a confirmed atheist. It was at this time that I first met him. To a 16-year-old discovering jazz, modern art and the beat generation writers, his enormous enthusiasm acted as a catalyst in my own development - as it did for many others. It was directly as a result of this meeting - I was working two stalls down from him in a summer vacation job on Rhyl fairground - that I got involved in the increasingly populist bohemia emerging in Liverpool. He helped organise various multi-media events and happenings that, as well as being extensions to his paintings inspired by the New York artist Allan Kaprow, also triggered his performance-driven poetry. Alongside that of the other so-called Liverpool poets, this resulted in the Liverpool Scene anthology, edited by Edward Lucie-Smith, then (with Roger McGough and Brian Patten) the Penguin Modern Poets' Mersey Sound, which remains one of the best-selling poetry collections of all time. Adrian's poems were very much those of a painter; he wrote what he saw, as much as what he felt, though what he described was often expressed with such passion that even the most simplistic listings of people or places were lit with an emotional glow. \"I want to paint/ Pictures worth their weight in money/ Pictures that tramps can live in/ Pictures that children would find in their stocking on Christmas morning/ Pictures that teenage lovers can send each other/ I want to paint/ pictures.\" Despite the media attention spotlighting his poetry activity, and an increasingly hectic working life as a performer - not least as frontman with the touring rock/ poetry band, the Liverpool Scene (with whom I played saxophone) - Adrian never stopped painting throughout the 1960s, a period that culminated in his winning a major prize at the John Moores Liverpool Exhibition of 1972. The prizewinning work was one of the last of a celebrated series of \"Meat Paintings\", which marked a turning point in both his art and personal life. After a heart attack, he had adopted a more relaxed lifestyle and an increasingly lyrical approach in his painting, with rural landscapes and hedgerows taking over from the hard edges of pop art and photorealism. Of course, Adrian's role as communicator had never been restricted to words and canvases; from his post-student days he had taught at schools, colleges of further education and, most notably, at Liverpool College of Art. Through the 1970s and 1980s, he enjoyed lectureships at polytechnics around the country, writers' tours for the Arts Council and a number of writer-in-residence appointments. Meanwhile, the one-man exhibitions continued, and the poetry books proliferated. His art and poetry became known worldwide, and exhibition openings and reading tours took him across the globe, from America to South Africa, each place becoming a source of inspiration for paint and words, be it Monet's garden at Giverny or the white-walled suburbs of Los Angeles. His energies extended to stage plays, children's books and television plays. In all this activity, it was Adrian's character that others warmed to. He was eclectic, tolerant and generous of spirit, and happy to mention influences as diverse as James Ensor, Nicholas de Sta\u00ebl, Jasper Johns and Mark Rothko in the same breath - or, in the case of Me, in the same poem. And he could be just as excited about the work of those around him, whose paintings, poetry or whatever he would promote with an enthusiasm sometimes bordering on the evangelical. Nearly two years ago Adrian suffered a severe stroke from which he would never properly recover, despite a dogged determination to walk, talk and paint again - aided, in no small way, by his partner of the last 15 years, Catherine Marcangeli. He did indeed start drawing again. There was the Walker Gallery retrospective and, only last week, an exhibition of paintings opened in Rhyl. The night before his death, Liverpool city council conferred the freedom of the city on him. Catherine survives him. Nell Dunn writes: Adrian Henri was a free spirit in the tradition of Byron and Shelley. He gave himself no limits, and so inspired others towards a greater freedom in their own work and life. I once said to him, \"I spend so much time trying to stop things happening to me,\" and Adrian said, \"I want everything to happen.\" He told me how, after a gig, he had gone back to a girl's room in some desolate seaside town and lost his wallet. Forced to leave before breakfast in the morning, he walked by the grey waves and, hearing a seagull, looked up - and a piece of bread dropped into his open mouth. We once did an Arts Council tour together, driving through the west country in a VW beetle. Adrian could neither drive nor map-read, and I got very cross having to do both. But he paid no attention to criticism. The sun shone and he had a huge appetite for pleasure of the sweetest kind ... sitting in the buttercups by the river eating bread and cheese ... discovering the stuffed alligator in the bed and breakfast in Liskeard ... falling asleep, his head on the table in some down-and-out nightclub in Manchester. Nothing daunted him. He continued to be fascinated by everything, heaped encouragement on other poets and painters, and was absolutely loyal to his friends. Once you were loved by Adrian, you were always loved. The last few years he spent very happily with Catherine. Adrian knew himself to be a lucky man. \u0095 Adrian Henri, painter and poet, born April 10 1932; died December 20 2000 Interviews and work online Interview Interview and poem: Je me souviens.

Although we live in the city, our neighbourhood in Jewish west Jerusalem opens onto a small park with stunning views of the walled city, and a dozen or so gnarled old olive trees. There is one in the front garden of our rented house.</p> <p>The owner had briefed us on what to expect: At some point in the late autumn, when the olives on the trees were darkening from green to black, the Palestinian women would turn up to strip the trees, returning later in the year with jars of golden oil. It was an experience he cherished, year after year.</p> <p>September came. And in its final days, the Palestinian uprising against the sluggardly pace of peace talks, and Israel's continuing hold on the West Bank and Gaza erupted. October and November passed, months of conflict and killing, with no sign of the olive pickers.</p> <p>The Palestinian families who used to picnic in the park disappeared, and so did the furtive couples, young women in headscarves holding hands with their boyfriends , while simultaneously looking over their shoulders for someone they knew.</p> <p>In the West Bank, the olive harvest, central to the economic life of the Palestinians, and the defining feature of its stony hills, was in trouble. A Palestinian man who tried to bring in his crop was shot dead by a Jewish settler near Nablus, dozens of others were beaten or injured by gunshot throughout the West Bank, terrorising the local Palestinians.</p> <p>Olive groves were chopped down and razed the length of the West Bank for \"security reasons\". Some trees were 200 years old; the Palestinians accused Israel of trying to erase their very presence on the land.</p> <p>I gave up on our tiny harvest. But on a Friday afternoon, the olive pickers finally arrived: grandmother and great aunt, in long embroidered dresses, mother and teenaged daughter in ragged jeans. One of the older women had a cane.</p> <p>The response in our exceedingly genteel section of West Jerusalem -- think Hampstead -- was electrifying. As the crew spread out, grandmother and mother hoisting themselves into a tree, one man bore down on the daughter, collecting the fallen fruit in a cloth. He was in full-flow by the time I was in earshot. \"Behave like a human being,\" he screamed in Hebrew, shaking a fist. \"If you want me to talk to you like a human being, then act like one.\"</p> <p>The girl, about 15, was silent. As it turned out later, she barely spoke Hebrew. I asked my neighbour what was wrong. He said he was all for the olive harvest, but this crew were making a terrible mess, dislodging olives and branches on the pavement. With no cleaners over the Jewish sabbath, the neighbourhood would be a mess for days.</p> <p>I fetched a broom. He grew even more agitated. The women looked afraid; I invited them to pick the tree in my garden, private property. I told them to ring the doorbell if there was any further problem. Three minutes later, they were frantically ringing the bell.</p> <p>My neighbour was back, having changed his clothes for the Jewish sabbath, and picked up a knife. He told me I did not understand the environmental devastation the women were causing. Proper olive harvesting leaves every branch intact, he said, and he was heartbroken at the destruction.</p> <p>I told him that it was my tree, and asked him to leave. He told me: \"Don't think you are so smart\" and raised the knife hand slightly. The women got back to work. I went inside and five minutes later the doorbell rang again. Another neighbour whom I did not know, a kippa-wearing immigrant from New York City, in his 60s.</p> <p>\"Do you know there is an Arab in your tree?\" he asked. I told him I did, and that I invited them there. He said: \"You let them in to pick your tree, and they stab you in the back. You have got a lot to learn.\" I asked him to leave too.</p> <p>He said he would give me ten dollars if I could name a Jew who had ever killed a Palestinian. I named Baruch Goldstein, who shot dead 29 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque six years ago. My neighbour said: \"That's different.\"</p> <p>We stood outside the gate, and watched the woman shake down the tree. His wife, laden with shopping bags, marched off on a solo mission: blocking the path of another Palestinian woman trying to cross the park and harvest a tree on another side. The two women were beginning to shove one another.</p> <p>\"They come here and pick the fruit off our trees,\" the woman from New York screamed. \"Do you know what happens when we try and go to their places? We come back in body bags.\" Then she tried reason. \"The thing is we like to harvest the olives when they are really black. I like to climb up there myself.\"</p> <p>The other neighbour returned, shaking with rage now, to criticise the way the women were cleaning up after the harvest. The grandmother crept off to try to harvest a few trees in the park, and he went to drag her back. The other olive pickers kept their heads down, but they were laughing.</p> <p>And so it went for nearly three hours, until our tree was plucked bare, and the women straggled back home to their village on the other side of the Mount of Olives.

While other websites are cutting their losses or bailing out of the market all together, Sportal shareholders have given their unequivocal stamp of approval for a policy of acquisition. Sportal is describing the move as a green light to act independently and be a \"force for consolidation\". No figures have been given, but shareholders have agreed to meet funds for any acquisitions, within reason, that Sportal wants to make. \"It means we don't have to go to the board every time we need to act quickly and buy other companies or assets,\" said a spokesman for Sportal. \"The market is entering a period of consolidation now and there's going to more opportunities to pick up assets and domain names of struggling websites As an indication of what Sportal wants to do with the \"war chest\" the spokesman suggested a look at its recent acquisition of the Eurofootball.com domain. Rob Hersov, Sportal CEO and founder, said: \"This additional funding will now allow us to accelerate our growth and to bring the Sportal network to profitability at an earlier date. We anticipate reaching this point in quarter one, 2002.\"",

      "bodyText": "Only a Christmas ratings miracle will ensure ITV meets its 38.5% peak-time share target. But the channel's top executives will get their performance-related bonuses whether the targets are met or not, it has emerged. ITV's official peak-time share for the year to date stands at 37.1% and, with two weeks to go before final year-end figures are in, it is unlikely to go much higher. David Liddiment, ITV director of programmes, and marketing and commercial director John Hardie will still receive performance-related bonuses. Other department heads including the head of current affairs, arts and religion and the head of factual programming, as well as head of drama Nick Elliott, also stand to get Christmas windfalls. A spokeswoman said that the ITV incentives package is incrementally linked to a set of performance goals, rather than specifically at the 38.5% target. While the headline peak-time share target will be missed, ITV is finishing the year with a strong autumn ratings performance. The station started out with a 37.7% share of peak-time in the first three months of 2000, 36.2% in the second quarter, and just 34.8% over the summer months. But the extension of Emmerdale into a five-daya-a-week soap and the decision to screen Who Wants to be a Millionaire? three days a week lifted the station's fortunes considerably. Its average share shot up to 38.7% since Saturday 16 September, when the frequency of the two programmes was increased. In the four weeks to December 8 - a period that included the Coronation Street 40th anniversary programming, the David Beckham documentary and Fully Monty premiere - ITV's share went up by 39.9% share of peak time viewing. Last year, a late spurt in the ratings on Christmas Day put Mr Liddiment and the then chief executive Richard Eyre within a whisker of their self-imposed target audience share and bonuses of \u00a375,000. However, the bonuses were ultimately paid out.",

      "body": "<p>A couple who went on the run with their foster children rather than return them to local authority care were yesterday given permission to adopt the girls. </p> <p>Jennifer and Jeffrey Bramley fled to Ireland with half sisters Jade and Hannah Bennett in September 1998 after Cambridgeshire social services decided they were unfit to adopt the girls. After four months in hiding, the couple gave themselves up in January 1999 and returned to Ramsey, Cambridgeshire, with Jade, now six, and Hannah, four. </p> <p>Mrs Justice Hogg, sitting in the high court's family division, made an adoption order that the children should become full and permanent members of the family in which they have lived for three years. </p> <p>When they returned from Ireland, postal worker Mr Bramley, 36, and his 37-year-old wife were due to face abduction charges.

      "bodyText": "A couple who went on the run with their foster children rather than return them to local authority care were yesterday given permission to adopt the girls. Jennifer and Jeffrey Bramley fled to Ireland with half sisters Jade and Hannah Bennett in September 1998 after Cambridgeshire social services decided they were unfit to adopt the girls. After four months in hiding, the couple gave themselves up in January 1999 and returned to Ramsey, Cambridgeshire, with Jade, now six, and Hannah, four. Mrs Justice Hogg, sitting in the high court's family division, made an adoption order that the children should become full and permanent members of the family in which they have lived for three years. When they returned from Ireland, postal worker Mr Bramley, 36, and his 37-year-old wife were due to face abduction charges. But they were dropped after the couple formally accepted their guilt and agreed to be cautioned. In June 1999, Mrs Justice Hogg ruled that the girls should remain in the care of the Bramleys for a trial period and the couple would share parental responsibility with social services for two years. This arrangement was due to be reviewed next year. Mrs Justice Hogg said she had been delighted to meet the girls with their adoptive parents. \"I wish the children and their family much happiness together,\" she said yesterday. She said all parties involved consented to the adoption application and the agreement \"is the best possible foundation for the children's future happiness\". She congratulated the couple for the way in which they had provided a loving and secure home life for Hannah and Jade. The couple went into hiding with the two girls after being told by social services officials that they would not be allowed to adopt the children. Their disappearance sparked a nationwide search by police and social services. The family lived in a series of homes in Ireland and wrote a letter to social services asking for a judge to rule on their case, before they gave themselves up.

      "body": "<p> 'Hello I am Betty. I am 78 and I want to have sex with some young men.\" In a sequence of photographs Betty, from Southampton, discards her sober black cardigan to strip to her underwear. At one point she wraps a feather boa - that staple prop of the porn model - around her neck. Finally she poses naked. </p> <p>This outgoing pensioner is hardly the kind of personality readers of the traditionally rightwing Express, which for years has given a home to that rather more staid family favourite Rupert the Bear, might be familiar with. </p> <p>But the \u00a3125m acquisition of Express Newspapers by Richard Desmond means that a somewhat disturbing but irresistible link between Rupert and Betty can be made. For Betty - along with many like her - is to be found on an internet site owned by Desmond through his web of interlinked companies. Desmond, a man who friends say has given \u00a35m to charity over 20 years including huge sums to the Federation of Boys' Clubs, will not be happy at the connection being made so public. </p> <p>An acquaintance of the Duke of Edinburgh, friend of David and Victoria Beckham and resident of north London's millionaire's row, Bishops' Avenue, Richard Clive Desmond had hoped that his purchase would bestow the kind of respectability he craves. Tea with Tony Blair at Number 10 has already followed. </p> <p>Whether the prime minister knew the true extent of Desmond's interests when he invited him into Downing Street for a 30-minute chat last week is unclear. </p> <p>Labour peer Clive Hollick, who sold the papers to the porn baron, left No 10 after making a short introduction. </p> <p>Desmond said little, Blair said how much he valued the support of the papers as press secretary Alastair Campbell chipped in that they recognised change was necessary. With an election only a few months away, Blair is more interested in keeping that support than challenging the new owner. </p> <p>When Express editor Rosie Boycott paid her own private visit to Downing Street after Desmond's interest first emerged, Blair made clear he would not interfere. Talking of newspaper proprietors, the prime minister said: \"They are all the same.\" </p> <p>Relations between Desmond and Blair are better than relations between Desmond and Boycott. </p> <p>He consults his lawyers before even sending Boycott a memo; she had her office swept for bugs on Tuesday to prevent her conversations being taped. </p> <p>The Express deal has turned the spotlight on Desmond's questionable business record - few experts believe he has the money to make a success out of the Express titles - and on his group of executives, some of whom have controversial pasts. </p> <p>Perhaps most annoying for Desmond, it has focused attention on a porn empire which has used Betty from Southampton and countless hundreds of other women to generate the cash to buy the Express, its Sunday stablemate and the Daily Star. </p> <p>Desmond, on holiday in Thailand with his wife, wants to be known for the celebrity magazine OK! with its pages of glossy colour pictures of the rich and famous trying to look ordinary, rather than as a porn baron. In the \"bumper\" festive edition of OK! Desmond is pictured dancing with Spice Girl Mel B at her Christmas party - and is described simply as chairman of Express Newspapers and OK! </p> <p><strong> Sleazy</strong><br> </p> <p> Desmond has a habit of threatening legal action over descriptions that he is a porn baron - though no such action has come before the courts - and would no doubt ferociously attack the idea that he is involved in the hardcore side of the business. When the Daily Mail, the Express' main competitor, branded him one of the country's \"most prolific peddlars of pornography\" and \"Desmond the degrader\", he exploded: \"I'm not a degrader, I'm not a degrader. It's adult entertainment not porn, that's what they do in Holland. I don't do Dutch.\" </p> <p>But an examination of the companies associated with Northern &amp; Shell and with Desmond's most loyal henchmen reveals the extent of his link to the sleazy side of the entertainment industry. </p> <p>Open a copy of the British Rates and Data (Brad) directory - a reference work used by the advertising industry of more than 13,000 publications recording the latest advertising prices - and you will find that no fewer than 20 of the 37 titles in the \"top shelf\" bracket are published by Fantasy Publications. </p> <p>Martin Ellice and Paul Ashford, now in charge of the day-to-day running of the Express, are directors of the company, which has its registered office at Northern &amp; Shell Tower. Ellice also acts as its secretary and Stan Myerson, back in charge of advertising at the Express after leaving there under a cloud in 1994 amid sensational claims of internal fighting and espionage, is described as \"group advertisement director\". </p> <p>Among the stable of magazines listed in Brad are some long-associated with Desmond, such as Asian Babes, Big &amp; Black, Big Ones International and Nude Readers Wives. But there are less well-known ones, pandering to every conceivable taste, including Double Sex Action, Fifty and Over and Mothers In Law. </p> <p>The entry also refers to a website called <a href=\"http://www.fantasy121.com\">www.fantasy121.com</a> which features on its \"Welcome Page\" two women, one dressed only in a tartan skirt, the other in nothing but a pair of knickers, in extremely intimate pose. The page gives an insight into the sort of services on offer - including \"live sex cams\", \"hot contacts\" and \"behind the scenes at X Television\", the empire's satellite television arm. </p> <p>Subscribers, says the page, can gain access to \"exclusive video\" and can \"meet horny cock-hungry women on line now!!!\". But there is also free access available after just a few clicks of the computer mouse to \"1000s of totally free pics\" split into categories such as \"teen angels\", \"black and asian\" and \"big ones\". There is also a \"fetish\" section promising \"hard action\". </p> <p>Betty from Southampton is to be found in the \"40 plus\" section. Lurking in the \"fetish\" area is a character called \"Anal Annie\". A photograph of a heavily pregnant woman posing naked is accompanied by the caption: \"My name is Kimberley. I am eight months pregnant.\" </p> <p>The site also often plays on a model's race. \"Big ones\" includes a photograph of a young naked woman with the headline: \"Pakistani girl shocks parents\". \"Thanks to Fantasy 21,\" she apparently says, \"I lost my virginity.\" One \"new\" photograph yesterday featured \"Sikh girl Penkesh from Delhi\" who \"wanted to try perverted sex\". </p> <p>The website also gives the satellite channel's listings. Typical titles listed this week included Amateur Girls, Butt Monkey and Diggin' The Dirt Hole. </p> <p>Though it is listed in Brad within entries for Fantasy Publications' titles, the domain name fantasy121.com is registered by Portland Enterprises, again a company which has Ellice and Ashford as directors. Portland Enterprises and Fantasy Publications are wholly owned subsidiaries of Portland Investments - which is wholly owned by Desmond. The intention to expand the web side of the business is clear. According to Network Solutions, a company which keeps a list of names which have been bagged, Portland Enterprises has already reserved fantasygrannies.com and the unalluring hagsandmonsters.com. </p> <p>Though Desmond is not a director of Portland Enterprises, nor of Fantasy Publications, the link with him is clear. And though the magazines and website steer clear of the label \"hardcore\", the content is clearly aimed at men and women who are seeking much more than Page Three. </p> <p>North London-born Desmond left school at 14 with little ambition and his career could have been so different if not for a chance meeting. </p> <p>Waiting for an interview for a job as a cloakroom assistant at Thomson Newspapers, he bumped into an advertising manager and ended up in classifieds. </p> <p>Now 49, his first foray into publishing was a musicians' magazine in 1974 and his first flirtation with porn came in 1982 when he won the right to publish a British edition of Penthouse, an agreement that was later terminated. </p> <p>More magazines followed, plus telephone sex lines in the 1980s, a porn channel in 1995, videos and now websites. </p> <p>What is almost certainly troubling him at the moment are figures. Does he have the financial clout to make his new venture work? </p> <p><strong> Empire</strong><br> </p> <p> In 1999, Northern &amp; Shell reported a loss before tax of \u00a3201,020 on sales of \u00a329.8m. Portland Investments, which houses his pornography empire, made a pre-tax profit of \u00a31.8m on sales of \u00a321.7m. Portland paid just \u00a3286 in tax. The company says the numbers were depressed by substantial investment in OK!. </p> <p>To fund the \u00a3125m takeover of the papers he took a \u00a397m loan from Commerzbank and has claimed he stumped up \"tens of millions\" of his personal fortune by cashing in shares and other assets. </p> <p>It would be almost impossible for the Bentley and Ferrari-driving entrepreneur to be as flush as he is flash but he insisted recently: \"The money I have put into this deal is half the money I can afford to lose and still have the same life.\" </p> <p>The newspapers are in need of serious investment. The Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, which wanted to buy the Express titles, had promised an annual \u00a350m to get them back on their feet. </p> <p>Certainly, Express Newspapers is hardly throwing off money. It made a profit of around \u00a310m last year of which almost \u00a36m came from its half ownership of West Ferry, the Docklands printing works which came with the papers. </p> <p>The future of West Ferry within Express Newspapers remains uncertain however. The plant which prints the Guardian, the Telegraph and the Express is a joint venture with the Telegraph Group, which has the right to buy Desmond's half because of the change of ownership. The Telegraph Group is known to be distrustful of Desmond and is keen to exercise its right. That could reap Desmond around \u00a340m, although in the medium term it would damage his cash flows. </p> <p>Another way of realising some cash would be a stock market flotation of Northern &amp; Shell, of which Desmond still owns 100%. But his belief that the Express will add some gravitas to Northern &amp; Shell ahead of a flotation is sneered at in the City. </p> <p>When he arrived at the paper, Desmond promised to spend whatever it takes to get the Express back on its feet. In the meantime, however, staff at the paper have watched in astonishment at his often naive attempts to pare back costs. Courier bikes were the first thing to go - Desmond couldn't understand why a daily newspaper could not simply rely on the post. Next was newspapers. He worked out that if journalists bought their own papers he could save \u00a330,000 a year. Both measures have since been reversed. </p> <p>Desmond has made 60 support staff redundant and has asked Boycott to draw up plans for heavy cuts in the editorial team. Staff are braced for cuts of between 100 and 200 in the paper's 450 editorial workforce. When it was explained to him that the paper needed a new health editor he asked why the paper couldn't just take material from the internet. </p> <p>The treatment of Express reader Paul Conway from Widnes may also offer a clue to Desmond's cash-flow difficulties. </p> <p>Shortly before the sale Mr Conway, 29, won a \"change your life\" competition giving him a new house and car (both provided by other companies) and \u00a310,000 a year or a \u00a3100,000 lump sum. He opted for the \u00a3100,000 but senior figures at the Express decided \u00a310,000 a year would be \"fairer\" because Desmond needed to stagger the payments. </p> <p>In the meantime Desmond is forced to pay Lord Hollick \u00a3250,000 a year simply for the use of the Ludgate House foyer. </p> <p>The one area where he does appear willing to invest in is unsurprising given his experience: the Sunday Express magazine will soon move on to glossy paper. </p> <p>Another is a \u00a375,000 new kitchen for his liveried butler who has moved with him from Docklands. Express staff have been bemused by the sight of the manservant wandering the 4th floor and Desmond, who likes his bananas served on a silver tray, sending him out to the fruit and veg stall outside Ludgate House on errands. </p> <p>On the day he moved in to Ludgate House, Desmond decided he liked the look of the office occupied by Express Newspapers' Andy Jonesco. \"I don't mean to be rude or anything,\" he is reported to have told him, \"but I want you the fuck out of there in two hours,\" he said. Jonesco has since left the company. </p> <p>Senior figures, including political editor Tony Bevins and columnist Peter Hitchens, have also resigned and Boycott has been overheard dictating an email to Desmond in which every other word was \"fucking\". She told the eavesdropper it was the only language he understood. </p> <p>What is Desmond's vision for the Express? Other than buying him respectability, and improving his still slim prospects of Tony and Cherie posing with baby Leo in OK!, even those who have been closest longest admit they haven't a clue. </p> <p>Desmond, according to a prominent acquaintance, almost \"stumbled\" into ownership of the Daily and Sunday Express. </p> <p><strong> Tired</strong><br> </p> <p> In October when it emerged Andrew Neil and the Barclay Brothers had bid \u00a375m for the United News &amp; Media titles, Desmond rang the former Sunday Times editor asking if he would sell him the Star. Neil signalled they might, and for a month Desmond rang, pressing Neil to do a deal. </p> <p>Tired of waiting, Desmond contacted Bernard Gray, United's head of strategy, and asked him to sell the Star. Gray suggested he take the lot. On November 22 Desmond bought the papers. </p> <p>This year is the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Daily Express. The paper's greatest period was under the tutelage of Lord Beaverbrook either side of the war when sales peaked at 5m. </p> <p>In a rare interview, Desmond said: \"I want to emulate Beaverbrook in making the Express No 1 in the middle market. There is a bust of him outside my new office and I feel he is looking at me and saying: 'Come on, you've got to restore the Express to its rightful position.\" </p> <p>A newspaper executive who dealt with Desmond during the sale suspects his plan is to break up the newly acquired group and, if he tries to hang onto them, the Mail will make up his mind for him as its owners spend an initial \u00a34m on marketing and cut-price offers to poach Express readers. </p> <p>\"If the Express and the Mail were in a boxing match the referee would stop it now because a featherweight and heavyweight would never be allowed into the ring at the same time,\" said the executive. </p> <p>\"Desmond has almost certainly bitten off more than he can chew. No one in the know, absolutely no one, seriously believes he will hang on to all three titles. After all, he only wanted the Star.\" </p> <p><strong>The tried and trusted lieutenants</strong></p> <p>Richard Desmond has brought together an experienced team to run the Express. Here his principal lieutenants are profiled </p> <p><strong> Stan Myerson, joint managing director Northern &amp; Shell</strong> </p> <p>As deputy advertising director at the Express in the mid-80s, Stan Myerson, 49, appeared the embodiment of the Thatcherite businessman. </p> <p>According to Andrew Cameron, who was group managing director at the time, Myerson made allegations - unproven - of financial impropriety against his boss Michael Moore, prompting Cameron to have Moore's office bugged. </p> <p>Cameron says Myerson then hired a firm of private detectives to shadow Moore to the company's summer party at a hotel in Manchester. Their report revealed that Moore had spent the night with a married classified ads manager. Moore resigned, fearing that Myerson would pass the detectives' findings on to his wife. </p> <p>Attention was then focused on Myerson, who had been moved sideways to become \"assistant to the managing director\".

      "bodyText": "'Hello I am Betty. I am 78 and I want to have sex with some young men.\" In a sequence of photographs Betty, from Southampton, discards her sober black cardigan to strip to her underwear. At one point she wraps a feather boa - that staple prop of the porn model - around her neck. Finally she poses naked. This outgoing pensioner is hardly the kind of personality readers of the traditionally rightwing Express, which for years has given a home to that rather more staid family favourite Rupert the Bear, might be familiar with. But the \u00a3125m acquisition of Express Newspapers by Richard Desmond means that a somewhat disturbing but irresistible link between Rupert and Betty can be made. For Betty - along with many like her - is to be found on an internet site owned by Desmond through his web of interlinked companies. Desmond, a man who friends say has given \u00a35m to charity over 20 years including huge sums to the Federation of Boys' Clubs, will not be happy at the connection being made so public. An acquaintance of the Duke of Edinburgh, friend of David and Victoria Beckham and resident of north London's millionaire's row, Bishops' Avenue, Richard Clive Desmond had hoped that his purchase would bestow the kind of respectability he craves. Tea with Tony Blair at Number 10 has already followed. Whether the prime minister knew the true extent of Desmond's interests when he invited him into Downing Street for a 30-minute chat last week is unclear. Labour peer Clive Hollick, who sold the papers to the porn baron, left No 10 after making a short introduction. Desmond said little, Blair said how much he valued the support of the papers as press secretary Alastair Campbell chipped in that they recognised change was necessary. With an election only a few months away, Blair is more interested in keeping that support than challenging the new owner. When Express editor Rosie Boycott paid her own private visit to Downing Street after Desmond's interest first emerged, Blair made clear he would not interfere. Talking of newspaper proprietors, the prime minister said: \"They are all the same.\" Relations between Desmond and Blair are better than relations between Desmond and Boycott. He consults his lawyers before even sending Boycott a memo; she had her office swept for bugs on Tuesday to prevent her conversations being taped. The Express deal has turned the spotlight on Desmond's questionable business record - few experts believe he has the money to make a success out of the Express titles - and on his group of executives, some of whom have controversial pasts. Perhaps most annoying for Desmond, it has focused attention on a porn empire which has used Betty from Southampton and countless hundreds of other women to generate the cash to buy the Express, its Sunday stablemate and the Daily Star. Desmond, on holiday in Thailand with his wife, wants to be known for the celebrity magazine OK! with its pages of glossy colour pictures of the rich and famous trying to look ordinary, rather than as a porn baron. In the \"bumper\" festive edition of OK! Desmond is pictured dancing with Spice Girl Mel B at her Christmas party - and is described simply as chairman of Express Newspapers and OK! Sleazy Desmond has a habit of threatening legal action over descriptions that he is a porn baron - though no such action has come before the courts - and would no doubt ferociously attack the idea that he is involved in the hardcore side of the business. When the Daily Mail, the Express' main competitor, branded him one of the country's \"most prolific peddlars of pornography\" and \"Desmond the degrader\", he exploded: \"I'm not a degrader, I'm not a degrader. It's adult entertainment not porn, that's what they do in Holland. I don't do Dutch.\" But an examination of the companies associated with Northern &amp; Shell and with Desmond's most loyal henchmen reveals the extent of his link to the sleazy side of the entertainment industry. Open a copy of the British Rates and Data (Brad) directory - a reference work used by the advertising industry of more than 13,000 publications recording the latest advertising prices - and you will find that no fewer than 20 of the 37 titles in the \"top shelf\" bracket are published by Fantasy Publications. Martin Ellice and Paul Ashford, now in charge of the day-to-day running of the Express, are directors of the company, which has its registered office at Northern &amp; Shell Tower. Ellice also acts as its secretary and Stan Myerson, back in charge of advertising at the Express after leaving there under a cloud in 1994 amid sensational claims of internal fighting and espionage, is described as \"group advertisement director\". Among the stable of magazines listed in Brad are some long-associated with Desmond, such as Asian Babes, Big &amp; Black, Big Ones International and Nude Readers Wives. But there are less well-known ones, pandering to every conceivable taste, including Double Sex Action, Fifty and Over and Mothers In Law. The entry also refers to a website called www.fantasy121.com which features on its \"Welcome Page\" two women, one dressed only in a tartan skirt, the other in nothing but a pair of knickers, in extremely intimate pose. The page gives an insight into the sort of services on offer - including \"live sex cams\", \"hot contacts\" and \"behind the scenes at X Television\", the empire's satellite television arm. Subscribers, says the page, can gain access to \"exclusive video\" and can \"meet horny cock-hungry women on line now!!!\". But there is also free access available after just a few clicks of the computer mouse to \"1000s of totally free pics\" split into categories such as \"teen angels\", \"black and asian\" and \"big ones\". There is also a \"fetish\" section promising \"hard action\". Betty from Southampton is to be found in the \"40 plus\" section. Lurking in the \"fetish\" area is a character called \"Anal Annie\". A photograph of a heavily pregnant woman posing naked is accompanied by the caption: \"My name is Kimberley. I am eight months pregnant.\" The site also often plays on a model's race. \"Big ones\" includes a photograph of a young naked woman with the headline: \"Pakistani girl shocks parents\". \"Thanks to Fantasy 21,\" she apparently says, \"I lost my virginity.\" One \"new\" photograph yesterday featured \"Sikh girl Penkesh from Delhi\" who \"wanted to try perverted sex\". The website also gives the satellite channel's listings. Typical titles listed this week included Amateur Girls, Butt Monkey and Diggin' The Dirt Hole. Though it is listed in Brad within entries for Fantasy Publications' titles, the domain name fantasy121.com is registered by Portland Enterprises, again a company which has Ellice and Ashford as directors. Portland Enterprises and Fantasy Publications are wholly owned subsidiaries of Portland Investments - which is wholly owned by Desmond. The intention to expand the web side of the business is clear. According to Network Solutions, a company which keeps a list of names which have been bagged, Portland Enterprises has already reserved fantasygrannies.com and the unalluring hagsandmonsters.com. Though Desmond is not a director of Portland Enterprises, nor of Fantasy Publications, the link with him is clear. And though the magazines and website steer clear of the label \"hardcore\", the content is clearly aimed at men and women who are seeking much more than Page Three. North London-born Desmond left school at 14 with little ambition and his career could have been so different if not for a chance meeting. Waiting for an interview for a job as a cloakroom assistant at Thomson Newspapers, he bumped into an advertising manager and ended up in classifieds. Now 49, his first foray into publishing was a musicians' magazine in 1974 and his first flirtation with porn came in 1982 when he won the right to publish a British edition of Penthouse, an agreement that was later terminated. More magazines followed, plus telephone sex lines in the 1980s, a porn channel in 1995, videos and now websites. What is almost certainly troubling him at the moment are figures. Does he have the financial clout to make his new venture work? Empire In 1999, Northern &amp; Shell reported a loss before tax of \u00a3201,020 on sales of \u00a329.8m. Portland Investments, which houses his pornography empire, made a pre-tax profit of \u00a31.8m on sales of \u00a321.7m. Portland paid just \u00a3286 in tax. The company says the numbers were depressed by substantial investment in OK!. To fund the \u00a3125m takeover of the papers he took a \u00a397m loan from Commerzbank and has claimed he stumped up \"tens of millions\" of his personal fortune by cashing in shares and other assets. It would be almost impossible for the Bentley and Ferrari-driving entrepreneur to be as flush as he is flash but he insisted recently: \"The money I have put into this deal is half the money I can afford to lose and still have the same life.\" The newspapers are in need of serious investment. The Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, which wanted to buy the Express titles, had promised an annual \u00a350m to get them back on their feet. Certainly, Express Newspapers is hardly throwing off money. It made a profit of around \u00a310m last year of which almost \u00a36m came from its half ownership of West Ferry, the Docklands printing works which came with the papers. The future of West Ferry within Express Newspapers remains uncertain however. The plant which prints the Guardian, the Telegraph and the Express is a joint venture with the Telegraph Group, which has the right to buy Desmond's half because of the change of ownership. The Telegraph Group is known to be distrustful of Desmond and is keen to exercise its right. That could reap Desmond around \u00a340m, although in the medium term it would damage his cash flows. Another way of realising some cash would be a stock market flotation of Northern &amp; Shell, of which Desmond still owns 100%. But his belief that the Express will add some gravitas to Northern &amp; Shell ahead of a flotation is sneered at in the City. When he arrived at the paper, Desmond promised to spend whatever it takes to get the Express back on its feet. In the meantime, however, staff at the paper have watched in astonishment at his often naive attempts to pare back costs. Courier bikes were the first thing to go - Desmond couldn't understand why a daily newspaper could not simply rely on the post. Next was newspapers. He worked out that if journalists bought their own papers he could save \u00a330,000 a year. Both measures have since been reversed. Desmond has made 60 support staff redundant and has asked Boycott to draw up plans for heavy cuts in the editorial team. Staff are braced for cuts of between 100 and 200 in the paper's 450 editorial workforce. When it was explained to him that the paper needed a new health editor he asked why the paper couldn't just take material from the internet. The treatment of Express reader Paul Conway from Widnes may also offer a clue to Desmond's cash-flow difficulties. Shortly before the sale Mr Conway, 29, won a \"change your life\" competition giving him a new house and car (both provided by other companies) and \u00a310,000 a year or a \u00a3100,000 lump sum. He opted for the \u00a3100,000 but senior figures at the Express decided \u00a310,000 a year would be \"fairer\" because Desmond needed to stagger the payments. In the meantime Desmond is forced to pay Lord Hollick \u00a3250,000 a year simply for the use of the Ludgate House foyer. The one area where he does appear willing to invest in is unsurprising given his experience: the Sunday Express magazine will soon move on to glossy paper. Another is a \u00a375,000 new kitchen for his liveried butler who has moved with him from Docklands. Express staff have been bemused by the sight of the manservant wandering the 4th floor and Desmond, who likes his bananas served on a silver tray, sending him out to the fruit and veg stall outside Ludgate House on errands. On the day he moved in to Ludgate House, Desmond decided he liked the look of the office occupied by Express Newspapers' Andy Jonesco. \"I don't mean to be rude or anything,\" he is reported to have told him, \"but I want you the fuck out of there in two hours,\" he said. Jonesco has since left the company. Senior figures, including political editor Tony Bevins and columnist Peter Hitchens, have also resigned and Boycott has been overheard dictating an email to Desmond in which every other word was \"fucking\". She told the eavesdropper it was the only language he understood. What is Desmond's vision for the Express? Other than buying him respectability, and improving his still slim prospects of Tony and Cherie posing with baby Leo in OK!, even those who have been closest longest admit they haven't a clue. Desmond, according to a prominent acquaintance, almost \"stumbled\" into ownership of the Daily and Sunday Express. Tired In October when it emerged Andrew Neil and the Barclay Brothers had bid \u00a375m for the United News &amp; Media titles, Desmond rang the former Sunday Times editor asking if he would sell him the Star. Neil signalled they might, and for a month Desmond rang, pressing Neil to do a deal. Tired of waiting, Desmond contacted Bernard Gray, United's head of strategy, and asked him to sell the Star. Gray suggested he take the lot. On November 22 Desmond bought the papers. This year is the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Daily Express.

Ashford is seen by Desmond as the \"guiding hand\" behind the OK! editorial team. He is said to be able to soak up Desmond's rages. Martin Ellice has been branded the company's Mr Nasty; others characterise him as Desmond's \"rottweiler\". Ian Monk, PR man Ian Monk worked on one of the group's titles, the Daily Star, before moving on to the Daily Mail. He was poached by the Express as deputy to editor Richard Addis.

Chanes flew to London in June 1991 and was placated when Desmond took him to a Variety Club dinner at the Greenwich Naval Club attended by the Duke of Edinburgh, a royal connection Desmond flouted the same month two years later when Prince Philip opened Northern &amp; Shell's head office in Docklands, London. As the New York links turned sour, rumours circulated of threats and counter- threats. Bailey flew to New York in October 1992 to set up the new Northern &amp; Shell distribution deals and it was on the morning of the 24th that he climbed into a limousine supposedly sent by a business colleague to take him to the airport and his homeward flight. Shortly after it pulled away from the hotel, two men jumped into the car and, in the police report, Bailey told how they assaulted him and issued the threats.",

Bruno Delecour, head of CanalSatellite, will take on operational responsibilities for the enlarged parent company, called Vivendi Universal. \"He is proud that the first operational manager of Vivendi Universal comes from Canal Plus,\" added the spokesman. Laurent Perpere, Canal's development and international activities director, also appears to have no future at the company.

      "body": "<p>Fresh evidence of the involvement of Richard Desmond, the new owner of the Daily Express and Daily Star, in the selling of hard pornography emerged last night after an investigation of his web of interlinked companies. </p> <p>Inquiries by the Guardian have revealed that a company wholly owned by Mr Desmond has registered a website which promises live heterosexual sex, live lesbian sex as well as other images portraying women as old as 78, pregnant, and one who calls herself Anal Annie. </p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Desmond, who was out of the country last night, admitted that the \"fantasy\" website was part of the businessman's empire which includes a whole stable of top shelf publications, OK! magazine, and now the Daily and Sunday Express and Daily Star, purchased last month for \u00a3125m. </p> <p>The sale of the newspapers, with a combined circulation of 1.6m, has yet to be referred to the trade secretary, Stephen Byers.

      "bodyText": "Fresh evidence of the involvement of Richard Desmond, the new owner of the Daily Express and Daily Star, in the selling of hard pornography emerged last night after an investigation of his web of interlinked companies. Inquiries by the Guardian have revealed that a company wholly owned by Mr Desmond has registered a website which promises live heterosexual sex, live lesbian sex as well as other images portraying women as old as 78, pregnant, and one who calls herself Anal Annie. A spokesman for Mr Desmond, who was out of the country last night, admitted that the \"fantasy\" website was part of the businessman's empire which includes a whole stable of top shelf publications, OK! magazine, and now the Daily and Sunday Express and Daily Star, purchased last month for \u00a3125m. The sale of the newspapers, with a combined circulation of 1.6m, has yet to be referred to the trade secretary, Stephen Byers. The Office of Fair Trading has invited comments on the acquisition and has set a deadline of next Wednesday. A report will then be passed to Mr Byers who, if he chooses, can refer the deal to the Competition Commission on public interest grounds. A precedent was set a decade ago when David Sullivan, publisher of the lurid Daily Sport newspaper, was prevented from taking over the Bristol Evening Post by the then monopolies &amp; mergers commission, now the competition commission. Although there was no reason to block the takeover on competition grounds, the MMC decided that Mr Sullivan's ownership of the newspaper group \"could harm the standing of the papers in their community\". If Mr Sullivan had bought the newspapers he \"could be expected to influence editorial policy and the character and content of these papers and this would harm both the accurate presentation of news and the free expression of opinion\", it added. The OFT inquiry is purely on competition grounds, but may also reflect any other public interest comments made by third parties. Mr Sullivan was referred automatically to the MMC because the combined circulation of his papers and the Bristol Evening Post group breached the rules on newspaper mergers. The acquisition of Express Newspapers by Mr Desmond has already attracted controversy. An early day motion by Brian Sedgemore and signed by 10 Labour MPs expressed \"grave concerns that national newspapers within the Express Group should have fallen under the ownership of a publisher of pornography\". Mr Desmond has set up an advisory board between himself and the newspaper editors to soften criticism that he interferes in the content of the titles, but many staff consider the system to be worthless. Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat media spokesman said: \"The facts that have been uncovered will cause concern for many longstanding Express readers. If he wants to run sex shows on the sidelines he is happy to do so, but in the public interest, none of that must cross to the newspapers.\" Mr Desmond had a 30-minute meeting in Downing Street last week with Tony Blair, who is unlikely to have known the full extent of his involvement in pornography. On his internet site Mr Desmond charges \u00a39.99 a month to watch \"live\" sex on web cams, and promotes his magazines. Related articles The tried and trusted lieutenants",

      "byline": "Steve Brown",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>What's all the fuss about intermediate care?</strong><br> The population is getting older. Already two out of three hospital patients are 65 or over and intermediate care is seen as an important way of improving services for the elderly.</p> <p><strong>Is it new?</strong><br> Despite the seemingly new creation of the \"big idea\" this year by ministers, intermediate care is nothing new. Also called \"step-down\" care, it is about providing services to ease the transition from hospital to home and from medical dependence to functional independence. But while the national beds inquiry, launched early in 2000, found some good examples of intermediate care, services were patchy and often set up on a temporary basis to get through winter crises. What ministers want now is to set up a more permanent tier of services that will operate all year round.</p> <p><strong>Will it end 'bed blocking'?</strong><br> It is certainly intended to free up hospital beds for more appropriate use. For older people, about 20% of bed days could be termed inappropriate if alternative facilities were in place. As well as representing poor care for patients, keeping patients in hospital beds longer than necessary is also expensive - costing up to \u00a31,200 per bed per week. </p> <p><strong>How will it work?</strong><br> A range of ideas are being examined. Medically stable patients could be transferred to community hospitals, special nurse-led care units or residential homes for rehabilitation, before finally being discharged to their own home. Or patients could be discharged home but provided with intensive support including nursing and therapeutic care. But intermediate care is about much more than ensuring faster discharge.</p> <p><strong>Like what?</strong><br> For a start, ministers are also keen to avoid inappropriate hospital admissions in the first place. Rapid response teams may be set up that could assess, diagnose and treat patients at home.</p> <p><strong>What differences will we actually see?</strong><br> According to last summer's NHS plan there will be an extra 5,000 intermediate care beds. Some will be in community hospitals, others in special wards in acute hospitals and some in purpose-built new facilities or redesigned private nursing homes. The plan also aims to introduce 1,700 extra non-residential intermediate care places.</p> <p><strong>Where will the money come from?</strong><br> The NHS plan claims to provide an extra \u00a3900m for intermediate care by 2003-04. It is understood that more than \u00a3500m of this may have to come from local councils, which run social services. </p> <p><strong>Has anything been spent already?</strong><br> Health authorities were expected to spend up to \u00a3150m this year from general allocations on intermediate care. And a further one-off sum of \u00a352m was also allocated in the summer to help health bodies prepare for winter. Next year a further \u00a338m is being added, meaning that health authorities and primary care groups will be expected to plough at least \u00a3188m into joint investment plans with councils. Guidance on intermediate care due out early in 2001 will unveil further investments for 2002-03 and 2003-04.</p> <p><strong>What about councils?</strong><br> This is where the government's pledge to spend an extra \u00a3900m may become tougher. For a start, councils are currently seeking clarification from ministers on how much local government is expected to pour into intermediate care. But identifying the amount is just part of the battle. Although councils receive nominal spending assessments for each of their main services, including personal social services, they actually receive a grant covering all services and are largely free to spend this as they see fit, in line with local priorities. </p> <p><strong>Can't the money be ring-fenced?</strong><br> To an extent. At the end of November, health secretary Alan Milburn announced an extra \u00a3100m for social services departments to spend in 2001-02. To receive the funds to help develop intermediate care, social services departments will have to agree on joint plans with NHS partners. But some authorities say that this increase is matched by a decrease in their spending assessment for services for older people.

      "bodyText": "What's all the fuss about intermediate care? The population is getting older. Already two out of three hospital patients are 65 or over and intermediate care is seen as an important way of improving services for the elderly. Is it new? Despite the seemingly new creation of the \"big idea\" this year by ministers, intermediate care is nothing new. Also called \"step-down\" care, it is about providing services to ease the transition from hospital to home and from medical dependence to functional independence. But while the national beds inquiry, launched early in 2000, found some good examples of intermediate care, services were patchy and often set up on a temporary basis to get through winter crises. What ministers want now is to set up a more permanent tier of services that will operate all year round. Will it end 'bed blocking'? It is certainly intended to free up hospital beds for more appropriate use. For older people, about 20% of bed days could be termed inappropriate if alternative facilities were in place. As well as representing poor care for patients, keeping patients in hospital beds longer than necessary is also expensive - costing up to \u00a31,200 per bed per week. How will it work? A range of ideas are being examined. Medically stable patients could be transferred to community hospitals, special nurse-led care units or residential homes for rehabilitation, before finally being discharged to their own home. Or patients could be discharged home but provided with intensive support including nursing and therapeutic care. But intermediate care is about much more than ensuring faster discharge. Like what? For a start, ministers are also keen to avoid inappropriate hospital admissions in the first place. Rapid response teams may be set up that could assess, diagnose and treat patients at home. What differences will we actually see? According to last summer's NHS plan there will be an extra 5,000 intermediate care beds. Some will be in community hospitals, others in special wards in acute hospitals and some in purpose-built new facilities or redesigned private nursing homes. The plan also aims to introduce 1,700 extra non-residential intermediate care places. Where will the money come from? The NHS plan claims to provide an extra \u00a3900m for intermediate care by 2003-04. It is understood that more than \u00a3500m of this may have to come from local councils, which run social services. Has anything been spent already? Health authorities were expected to spend up to \u00a3150m this year from general allocations on intermediate care. And a further one-off sum of \u00a352m was also allocated in the summer to help health bodies prepare for winter. Next year a further \u00a338m is being added, meaning that health authorities and primary care groups will be expected to plough at least \u00a3188m into joint investment plans with councils. Guidance on intermediate care due out early in 2001 will unveil further investments for 2002-03 and 2003-04. What about councils? This is where the government's pledge to spend an extra \u00a3900m may become tougher. For a start, councils are currently seeking clarification from ministers on how much local government is expected to pour into intermediate care. But identifying the amount is just part of the battle. Although councils receive nominal spending assessments for each of their main services, including personal social services, they actually receive a grant covering all services and are largely free to spend this as they see fit, in line with local priorities. Can't the money be ring-fenced? To an extent. At the end of November, health secretary Alan Milburn announced an extra \u00a3100m for social services departments to spend in 2001-02. To receive the funds to help develop intermediate care, social services departments will have to agree on joint plans with NHS partners. But some authorities say that this increase is matched by a decrease in their spending assessment for services for older people. The government, they say, is giving with one hand and taking away with the other. Can social services afford to expand intermediate care? It will be extremely challenging. Social services directors are already predicting overspends this year. And with many spending well over their standard spending assessments as it is, funding new developments for the elderly is likely to be at the expense of other front line services.",

With the midnight deadline for nominations drawing near, the contest was shaping up as a battle of the generals, with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, squaring off against the hardline Likud leader, Ariel Sharon. Meanwhile in Washington, amid the faintest of hopes of a breakthrough between Israel and the Palestinians, President Bill Clinton and his secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, offered the two sides what they called a framework agreement for a possible peace deal. But there were conflicting signs about its acceptability. Israel's foreign minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, and his aides gave a series of upbeat interviews about progress in the talks, including a suggestion that Mr Clinton had presented new plans for territorial divisions in the West Bank and Jerusalem. \"Israel could definitely live with the majority of these parameters,\" Mr Ben-Ami told Israel radio. With the election due on February 6 and Mr Clinton set to leave office on January 20, both the Barak government and the outgoing US administration have much to gain politically from a fresh diplomatic effort. However the senior Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said he had informed Mr Clinton that his side wanted the future of Jerusalem and other tough unresolved issues included in any agreement. \"We are having very, very serious discussions,\" Mr Erekat said. \"At the same time, we're facing major difficulties and serious differences.\" He said Israel must withdraw to its boundaries before the 1967 war, which would mean it relinquishing east Jerusalem and all the West Bank and Gaza, and accept millions of Palestinians as refugees. Outlining a hardline peace policy at the start of a six-week-long election campaign, the hawkish Mr Sharon told an academic conference in the Israeli coastal city of Herzliya that the government could not agree to share sovereignty over Jerusalem, the crux of the conflict. \"There is no opportunity to reach a final-status accord today because it is not possible to divide Jerusalem,\" he said. The Likud leader's political hopes were boosted by the failure of Mr Peres to win the endorsement of the leftwing Meretz party. Israeli election law obliges independent candidates for prime minister to win the support of at least 10 parliamentarians of a single party. Though Mr Peres had Meretz grassroots support, the leadership balked at the prospect of splitting the vote of the peace camp. Meretz's decision is an explosive one, and though it was meant ostensibly to avoid splitting the left, it could do just that. Mr Barak has alienated the peace camp and Israel's 1m Arab citizens, whose support gave him victory 18 months ago. With only Mr Barak and Mr Sharon in the race, after the on again-off again candidacy of the former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, many fear that leftwing and Arab voters will not bother to go to the polls.

      "bodyText": "The disgraced former Tory MP Neil Hamilton's six-year battle to clear his name in an English court ended in defeat yesterday when three appeal court judges refused to overturn a libel jury's verdict against him. Mr Hamilton's only option now is to take his battle to the European court of justice, a move which he said he would consider after calling the latest finding against him \"justice in Wonderland\". The former MP for Tatton has now been branded corrupt in the course of two high court cases since the Guardian first reported the cash-for-questions scandal in 1994. He has also been hauled before the Commons committee on members' interests and been heavily criticised in a report by the standards and privileges committee. Yesterday - a year to the day after losing a desperate libel battle against Mohammed Al Fayed - his attempt to have the verdict set aside was turned down by three appeal court judges, including Lord Phillips, master of the rolls. Mr Hamilton claimed the trial was unfair because crucial court documents taken from bins outside his barrister's chambers had been bought by Mr Fayed. The court accepted that the Harrods owner probably had been involved in the plot but decided that it would not have made any difference to the outcome of the case. Crucially for Mr Hamilton and his wife Christine, the court also lifted \"stays\" which had been put on costs orders relating to the trial and on the naming of the backers who have bankrolled Mr Hamilton's fight. It is estimated that he could face costs of \u00a32m and the prospect of losing his Cheshire home. The couple showed little emotion as the judgment was handed down in court. Outside, however, Mr Hamilton said: \"This is the most bizarre and unexpected of results. \"For six and a quarter years I have been fighting a billionaire crook. I cannot believe that this is English justice. Outside this court it says 'high court of justice' but I am thinking of going out to buy the letters I and N to add to that.\" Mr Hamilton said he would be consulting his lawyers before deciding whether to fight on. Asked if he was bankrupt, he said: \"Not as we speak.\" Mrs Hamilton added quickly: \"That is a technical term.\" Asked how he would pay his costs, he said: \"You can't have less than nothing. I can't pay Fayed anything. I already owe more money to my lawyers than I have.\" Mr Hamilton had sued over claims made by Mr Fayed in a Channel 4 Dispatches programme in January 1997 that he corruptly demanded and accepted cash payments, gift vouchers and a free holiday at the Paris Ritz in return for asking parliamentary questions. Yesterday's judgment recalled how the trial judge, Mr Justice Morland, had crystallised the case in a single question put to the jury: \"Are you satisfied on the balance of probabilities that Mr Fayed has established on highly convincing evidence that Mr Hamilton was corrupt in his capacity as a member of parliament?\" Lord Phillips said: \"The jury answered 'yes' and found accordingly for Mr Al Fayed...The single question put to the jury represented the single issue in this case.\" The judges did not agree with the claim during this appeal that Mr Hamilton had lost because of separate allegations which surfaced just before the trial that he had corruptly taken money from Mobil for parliamentary services. Lord Phillips said: \"We do not agree...On the material before the court and in the light of [Judge Morland's] summing-up, the jury may have found against Mr Hamilton on the cash-for-questions issue, the Mobil issue or both.\" The judge said that on the balance of probabilities the court believed Mr Hamilton's claims that a character called Benjamin Pell - nicknamed Benji the Binman - did supply documents to the freelance journalist Mark Hollingsworth, who passed them on to Mr Fayed's head of security, John Macnamara, for \u00a310,000. Furthermore, the court believed that in making the payment Mr Macnamara was acting on behalf of Mr Fayed. Lord Phillips said Mr Fayed, who testified in court that he knew nothing of the documents, was \"not an impressive witness\". But the judges decided that there was \"no reason to believe that they [the documents] will have given any significant procedural advantage to Mr Al Fayed.\" Lord Phillips said: \"The judge gave the jury as strong a warning against giving credence to Mr Al Fayed's uncorroborated evidence as it is possible to imagine.

There was confusion about what the exhausted leaders decided in the small hours of the morning about how many votes each EU state will get in decisions by the council of ministers. Meeting for a second consecutive day, the permanent representatives of the 15 member states struggled to resolve conflicting figures in different parts of the summit text - an embarrassing outcome for the summit organiser, France, which is days away from ending its six-month stint in the union's rotating presidency. Nice, the longest summit in EU history, was supposed to be a defining treaty, ushering in long-overdue institutional reforms needed to allow the union to go ahead with enlargement to the east. Several key problems remain, but diplomats in Brussels said last night that the biggest was still the glaring inconsistency between two different figures for \"re-weighting\" the votes of member states in the decision-making council of ministers. In one place the Nice treaty refers to the figure of 91 votes as the threshold needed for a so-called \"blocking minority\". But elsewhere it refers to a majority of 73.4% of votes being enough to override the minority, which would imply 93 votes as the blocking figure. The problem arose because of last-minute haggling that added three votes to the total because of small countries' outrage at what was seen as a coup d'etat by bigger states. In the final tense half-hour of the summit, close to 4am, the Belgian prime minister, Guy Verhofstadt, won two more future votes for Lithuania and one extra for Romania, arguing that these candidate countries had been discriminated against relative to others of a similar population size. Critics say that whether or not this problem is ironed out, decision-making is now so complicated that it will not be possible without the aid of pocket calculators. Every delegation, including Britain's, took special software to Nice to work out majorities, blocking threshholds and fairness ratios.

      "bodyText": "The food standards agency yesterday admitted there was an \"anomaly\" in Britain's regulation of contaminated poultry after three executives were found guilty of selling more than 1,000 tonnes of rotten petfood meat for human consumption. Andrew Boid, 33, Darren Bibby, 39 and Peter Tantram, 47, wholesale meat suppliers from the East Midlands, made \u00a32.5m from hosing down condemned chicken and turkey destined for tins of Spillers and Pedigree petfood and selling it to butchers, market traders, restaurants and supermarkets across England, Scotland and Wales. The three had denied charges of conspiracy to supply unfit meat into the human food chain. In a three-month trial at Hull crown court, Ben Nolan QC, prosecuting, told the jury that over a three-year period, the men had caused an \"incalculable risk to human health\" by acquiring condemned poultry fit only for petfood, slicing through mould and green slime to find scraps of remaining pink meat, washing it in salt and repackaging it as fit for humans. The three men will be sentenced today alongside John McGinty, a meat broker from Rotherham and Arnold Smith, a meat dealer from Sheffield, who earlier pleaded guilty to their part in the conspiracy. Three other food brokers - Timothy Powell, Louise Tantram and Kevin Wilson - were found not guilty of conspiracy. Another defendant died within hours of his first court appearance and Clive Boid, a former director of Prosper De Mulder, Britain's biggest meat rendering firm, was acquitted of conspiracy but found guilty of a charge of fraudulently selling petfood meat as quality human food. Rotherham council's environmental health department, which investigated the scam at its own cost of \u00a3500,000, warned yesterday that it had found what was potentially the tip of an iceberg of contaminated poultry laundering in Britain. Lewis Coates, team leader, said: \"This investigation was potentially only part of a much wider problem. As it proceeded, officers became aware that similar scams were operating throughout the country.\" He said there was a loophole in the law whereby poultry is exempt from stringent rules which require condemned meat to be stained with indelible dye to prevent resale for human consumption. The food standards agency said it had had one meeting with Rotherham council this month and so far no evidence had been provided of an illicit trade in condemned poultry outside the court case. An FSA spokeswoman said of the law which allowed contaminated poultry to go unstained: \"It is an anomaly which we have picked up and are looking at.\" Rotherham council began its investigation in 1995 after an anonymous letter from a local butcher. It found the gang had set up a secret boning shed operation at Wells By-Products factory at Darlton, near Newark. There, Boid and Tantram employed 12 workers in a 20-hour a day operation to remove feathers, mould and green bits of flesh from petfood grade meat. Raids revealed hundreds of tons of bruised poultry, covered in faeces. Meat like this had been hosed down and left to steep in salt baths. Then it was packed and relabelled as fit for humans. Police discovered a nationwide distribution network, using unmarked lorries, false names and paperwork to sell meat, heavily disguised to look white, which moved through a series of middle men on to supermarkets including Kwiksave and Netto. Money changed hands in car parks, pubs and through private bank accounts. The conspirators made a profit of \u00a31 per pound of chicken and 60p per pound of turkey.",

In fact the situation has become so dire that \"hold\" recommendations are now interpreted by fund managers as \"sell\" advice. </p> <p>The root of the problem is the pressure exerted by corporate finance departments. Such is the need to secure the position of adviser on the next corporate takeover or flotation that analysts are uncomfortable writing something negative on a company which is, or could become, a client. </p> <p>The recent case of Orange, the mobile phone company, trying to vet independent analysis produced before its listing has taken the debate to another, and more worrying, level. </p> <p>Investors, therefore, are always keen to get their hands on some raw data and luckily enough there was some floating around yesterday. Market research firm Taylor Nelson Sofres has just released the latest data on the respective market share of the nation's food retailers, and it does not make pleasant reading for <strong>Sainsbury</strong>, unchanged at 405p. </p> <p>According to Taylor Nelson, in the four weeks to December 10 Sainsbury's market share dropped noticeably, from 18% to 17.6%. Analysts reckon this is Sainsbury's lowest market share in living memory and puts its position as the nation's second biggest grocer in jeopardy. Wal-Mart-owned Asda was yesterday claiming it is the second biggest, something Sainsbury angrily denied. </p> <p>Whatever the truth, market professionals believe the data could be a signal to sell Sainsbury. Since appointing Sir Peter Davis to run the group in March, Sainsbury's price has risen almost 200p but profitability has not improved. </p> <p>In the wider market it was another tough day with more gloomy corporate news rolling in from the other side of the Atlantic - warnings from telecom company AT&amp;T and equipment maker Lucent. With traders still trying to figure out why the Federal Reserve had warned about an impending recession in North America this week and then decided to do nothing about it, the FTSE 100 ended 61.2 points lower at 6,115.5. </p> <p>This was off the lowest levels of the day thanks to a late Nasdaq surge but still left the blue chip index at its lowest closing level for seven months and on course to record its worst annual performance since its creation at the end of 1983. </p> <p>In the wake of the AT&amp;T warning, telecom stocks were under pressure. <strong>BT</strong> fell 32p to 590p and <strong>Cable &amp; Wireless</strong> eased 3p to 919. But it was market heavyweight <strong>Vodafone</strong>, off 11p to 234, that did the real damage, as dealers fretted about the impact of 220m freshly minted Vodafone shares hitting the market in the near future. </p> <p>Vodafone yesterday acquired the mobile operations of Irish telecoms group Eircom for $4.01bn (\u00a32.6bn). One un fortunate effect of the deal is that Dutch telecoms group KPN, which owns a 21% stake in Eircom, has ended up with 220m Vodafone shares that it is free to sell 30 days after the deal is completed. Given KPN's financial position, traders think it will sell at the first possible opportunity. </p> <p>The tech sector was also weak with the FTSE Techmark 100 falling 45.07 points to 2,499.05. <strong>Autonomy</strong>, down 191 to \u00a319.45, and <strong>Dimension Data</strong>, 33p lower at 462p, were the worst casualties. </p> <p>Things were a little brighter in the mid cap world as a couple of takeovers - a counter offer for oil company <strong>Lasmo</strong>, up 21.5p to 199p from Italy's ENI and a \u00a3692m offer for heating products concern <strong>Hepworth</strong>, 26.5p stronger at 279.5 - spiced things up. Turnover in Lasmo almost reached 700m shares. Apparently ENI's brokers moved into the market and bought 10% of Lasmo shares. </p> <p>But the FTSE Mid 250 ended 14.7 points adrift at 6,423.1. Handheld computer specialist <strong>Psion</strong> was the worst performer, down 47p to 243.5p, unsettled by disappointing second quarter figures from US rival Palm.</p>",

Since appointing Sir Peter Davis to run the group in March, Sainsbury's price has risen almost 200p but profitability has not improved. In the wider market it was another tough day with more gloomy corporate news rolling in from the other side of the Atlantic - warnings from telecom company AT&amp;T and equipment maker Lucent. With traders still trying to figure out why the Federal Reserve had warned about an impending recession in North America this week and then decided to do nothing about it, the FTSE 100 ended 61.2 points lower at 6,115.5. This was off the lowest levels of the day thanks to a late Nasdaq surge but still left the blue chip index at its lowest closing level for seven months and on course to record its worst annual performance since its creation at the end of 1983. In the wake of the AT&amp;T warning, telecom stocks were under pressure. BT fell 32p to 590p and Cable &amp; Wireless eased 3p to 919. But it was market heavyweight Vodafone, off 11p to 234, that did the real damage, as dealers fretted about the impact of 220m freshly minted Vodafone shares hitting the market in the near future. Vodafone yesterday acquired the mobile operations of Irish telecoms group Eircom for $4.01bn (\u00a32.6bn). One un fortunate effect of the deal is that Dutch telecoms group KPN, which owns a 21% stake in Eircom, has ended up with 220m Vodafone shares that it is free to sell 30 days after the deal is completed. Given KPN's financial position, traders think it will sell at the first possible opportunity. The tech sector was also weak with the FTSE Techmark 100 falling 45.07 points to 2,499.05. Autonomy, down 191 to \u00a319.45, and Dimension Data, 33p lower at 462p, were the worst casualties. Things were a little brighter in the mid cap world as a couple of takeovers - a counter offer for oil company Lasmo, up 21.5p to 199p from Italy's ENI and a \u00a3692m offer for heating products concern Hepworth, 26.5p stronger at 279.5 - spiced things up. Turnover in Lasmo almost reached 700m shares. Apparently ENI's brokers moved into the market and bought 10% of Lasmo shares. But the FTSE Mid 250 ended 14.7 points adrift at 6,423.1. Handheld computer specialist Psion was the worst performer, down 47p to 243.5p, unsettled by disappointing second quarter figures from US rival Palm.",

It takes just seconds for her calm, reasonable manner to give way and - hey presto - she's become Tony, seeing red and spouting obscenities. Elsewhere she is seen to be gently losing her grip. She's cracking up, obsessive, bargaining with her own therapist and drinking the hard stuff between sessions. The waste, everywhere we look, is floating to the surface. </p> <p>As Tony's chest tightens, and his vision starts to blur once again, it is almost as if we feel the same claustrophobic symptoms in a desire for some resolution of all these festering problems. \"You poor bastard,\" Tony growls, as he watches his future brother-in-law. But it is left ambiguous as to whether Tony is referring to himself, or Richie April. </p> <p>It was an episode that again showed an ER-like ability with sparkling dialogue, with every scene pushing to a climax line by line, but the crucial difference is that Sopranos hardly seems to even break into a sweat. People just sit opposite each other and talk. \"The pursuit of happiness is guaranteed in writing,\" Tony tells his psychiatrist. \"Where's my happiness?\" \"It's the pursuit that's guaranteed,\" she tells him. </p> <p>We were also presented with a touching subplot in the form of Junior, Tony's ailing elderly uncle, finding what may well be love, or at least someone to adjust his new anti-snoring mask.

(\"I'm not a cat,\" he says, after being asked why he won't use a bedpan. \"I don't shit in a box.\"). </p> <p>While leaving hospital, he runs into Catherine, a woman he used to know. \"You break your ankle?\" he said, as he was being wheeled out, pointing at her bandaged foot. \"No,\" she replied. \"Bunions.\" Again, the plot was impossible to second guess. Just as a touching story about old people in love seemed on its way, Catherine calls round at Junior's house with some homemade cooking. But Junior blows her out. Why? \"Bunions,\" he tells his burly home help. \"You know how I feel about feet.\" </p> <p>Scene to scene, the episode shows off how the script mines yet more ambiguity in butting the comic moments up against the severe and the violent - just as the smiling gangster face is always the one with a gun to your belly.

Badaboom! </p> <p>In the final scene, the lads are all back together at the cafe when a car crash outside brings these ruthless gangsters rushing out on to the street, appalled at the thought of drivers speeding in their neighbourhood. But as the camera spirals up, past a sign for \"suckling pigs\" it's clear that everyone is going down the pan. </p> <p>It's just a question of who's going to float.</p>",

In the final scene, the lads are all back together at the cafe when a car crash outside brings these ruthless gangsters rushing out on to the street, appalled at the thought of drivers speeding in their neighbourhood. But as the camera spirals up, past a sign for \"suckling pigs\" it's clear that everyone is going down the pan. It's just a question of who's going to float.",

      "bodyText": "Telecommunications equipment maker Lucent Technologies delivered another blow to fragile sentiment regarding technology stocks yesterday when it warned that it was on course to run up bigger than expected losses in the last three months of the year. The announcement followed hard on the heels of AT&amp;T, the long distance telecoms group, to cut its fourth quarter dividend - the first time the company had ever reduced its pay-out to shareholders. But while the news from AT&amp;T sparked a sharp sell-off on Wednesday, Lucent's revelation that it would lose between $800m and $1bn in the first three months of next year had a less dramatic impact. Although its share price fell 18% to its lowest level for almost three years, heavy trading on Nasdaq - which was down 7% on Wednesday - made up part of the lost ground. \"The market is oversold,\" said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker. \"We are going to have these very significant rallies, but the question is, does it hold?.\" Nasdaq was also helped by a statement from telephone and data provider Qwest Communications, which said both its fourth quarter and full-year earnings would be above Wall Street estimates. The company put out the statement in response to what it described as \"recent market turmoil and extraordinary speculation about the likely results of major companies in the sector\". One reason why Lucent - which was spun off from AT&amp;T - had less impact on other stocks than might have been expected was the view that many of its problems were specific to the company. Lucent has fallen behind in the optical networking market while sales of its office equipment products have fallen more rapidly than expected. It has also had to increase its reserves against bad debts on its vendor financing programme. \"It is unclear how quickly Lucent will be able to implement and track a more conservative set of policies,\" said Merrill Lynch analyst Michael Ching. Lucent said it was seeking to cut costs by up to $1bn a year as it tries to restore profitability, with some observers suggesting that could lead to the loss of up to 12,000 jobs. Its chairman, Henry Schacht, said the company was anticipating improved performance on a quarter by quarter basis over the remainder of the fiscal year 2001, adding he expected the company's performance in 2002 to be at or above market rates.

At the last census my wife put White British, I put Greek Cypriot (despite having been born in England). Our children, then 11 and 15, enjoyed working out quite happily that they should for census purposes describe themselves as: other - Anglo-Cypriot. They were not dispirited by the experience and if anything it reinforced their appreciation of being part of two cultures.</p> <p>Our children clearly do not fit in the same box as either my wife or myself when describing ethnic origins for census purposes, but so what! Nobody is ashamed or upset by that, and the government have accurate descriptions for profiling the population. Maybe Louisa Young should relax and allow her daughter to describe herself as whatever her daughter is most comfortable with, and to celebrate whatever that happens to be. <br><b>AG Krokou</b><br> London</p>",

Ethnic monitoring is designed to identify people likely to have less-than-equal opportunities due to their ethnic origin or physical appearance. By this criterion - and the history of Caribbean people - my son is black. I am - and he, I hope, will be - content and proud to proclaim him as such. Richard Kirkwood University of North London r.kirkwood@unl.ac.uk \u0095 Louisa Young sure is confused about ethnicity. At the last census my wife put White British, I put Greek Cypriot (despite having been born in England). Our children, then 11 and 15, enjoyed working out quite happily that they should for census purposes describe themselves as: other - Anglo-Cypriot. They were not dispirited by the experience and if anything it reinforced their appreciation of being part of two cultures. Our children clearly do not fit in the same box as either my wife or myself when describing ethnic origins for census purposes, but so what! Nobody is ashamed or upset by that, and the government have accurate descriptions for profiling the population. Maybe Louisa Young should relax and allow her daughter to describe herself as whatever her daughter is most comfortable with, and to celebrate whatever that happens to be. AG Krokou London",

Then only 24, he had already shot down three German bombers, the first of them at night, near Dunbar, before the squadron moved south. His eventual score was at least eight confirmed, with four \"probables\".</p> <p>Despite this, Johnstone counted himself a notoriously bad shot, claiming that \"if I had downed all the German aircraft I shot at, I'd have ended up with a very big score\". Good shot or not, the citation for his DFC, gazetted on October 1 1940, described him as conspicuously successful and \"a leader of ability and determination\".</p> <p>Johnstone was born in Glasgow and educated at Kelvinside Academy. At the age of 18, while working for an Edinburgh shoe company, he joined 602 squadron and spent his weekends learning to fly. During the next four years, he worked as a civilian navigation instructor, first at Scottish Aviation and later at the Civil Air Navigation School, Prestwick. In August 1939, he was called up for fulltime service with 602 squadron.</p> <p>Following a spell as operations controller at Royal Air Force Turnhouse, Johnstone went to Haifa in April 1942 as sector commander, from where he moved to become station commander at Luqa, in Malta, before taking command of a Spitfire wing there.</p> <p>At the beginning of 1943, with air attacks on Malta lessening, the RAF was able to return to the offensive and, on January 16, Johnstone escorted 12 Spitfires, acting in the unlikely role of bombers, with a 500lb payload beneath each wing, in a spectacular low-level attack on a chemical factory at Panchino, Sicily. He later wrote a lively account of this raid, admitting that so overwhelming was the feeling of excitement that \"your mouth ran dry with the taste of it\". For his service in Malta, Johnstone received a mention in dispatches.</p> <p>Later that year he returned to Britain to attend staff college, following this with a stint in command of a Hurricane conversion unit and a period as officer commanding Fairwood Common. In May 1944, promoted acting group captain, he joined the Allied Expeditionary Air Force operations staff in preparation for D-Day. After the landings in Aule, he went to Normandy with HQ AEAF.</p> <p>A short attachment to the RAF delegation in Washington followed, after which Johnstone joined the staff at HQ Fighter Command's 12 Group. Having been granted a permanent commission, he served as air attach\u00e9 in Dublin from 1946-48, and held a number of Air Ministry posts before an enjoyable two years as officer commanding RAF Ballykelly. In 1953, he commanded the air-sea warfare development unit at RAF St Mawgan and the next year returned to 12 Group as senior air staff officer.</p> <p>In 1956, with the Malayan emergency continuing, Johnstone went to the far east as deputy air defence commander in Malaya, following this with a secondment to help set up what became the Royal Malaysian Air Force. Back in Britain, he held various appointments, including director of personnel at the Air Ministry. Having enjoyed the far east, he jumped at the chance to return, this time to Borneo as Air Commodore, Commonwealth Air Forces.</p> <p>Promoted air vice-marshal in 1965, his last appointments included command of Coastal Command's 18 Group, air officer Scotland and Northern Ireland and maritime air commander, Nato. He was appointed CB in 1966 and, reflecting his years as an Auxiliary Air Force officer, also held the much-prized air efficiency award.</p> <p>For 10 years following his retirement in 1968, Johnstone was vice-chairman of the Territorial Auxiliary and Volunteer Reserve. He was a deputy lieutenant of Glasgow from 1971-94. For a number of years, he worked for National Car Parks, heading their Scottish operations and, later, as London director.</p> <p>He enjoyed sailing, golf and writing. His first book, One Man's War (1964), was followed by Where No Angels Dwell (1969), Enemy In The Sky (1976), Adventure In The Sky (1978), Spitfire Into War (1986), and Diary Of An Aviator (1993).</p> <p>Looking back on 1940, Johnstone admitted that the most worrying part was waiting for the telephone to ring with the order to scramble. \"For years afterwards,\" he wrote, \"the sound of a phone ringing two houses away would have me out of bed. I still hate the ringing of a telephone.\"</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, whom he married in 1940, a son, who is a serving army officer, and two daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 Air Vice-Marshal Alexander Vallance Ridell 'Sandy' Johnstone, airman and author, born June 2 1916; died December 13 2000</p>",

He was appointed CB in 1966 and, reflecting his years as an Auxiliary Air Force officer, also held the much-prized air efficiency award. For 10 years following his retirement in 1968, Johnstone was vice-chairman of the Territorial Auxiliary and Volunteer Reserve. He was a deputy lieutenant of Glasgow from 1971-94. For a number of years, he worked for National Car Parks, heading their Scottish operations and, later, as London director. He enjoyed sailing, golf and writing. His first book, One Man's War (1964), was followed by Where No Angels Dwell (1969), Enemy In The Sky (1976), Adventure In The Sky (1978), Spitfire Into War (1986), and Diary Of An Aviator (1993). Looking back on 1940, Johnstone admitted that the most worrying part was waiting for the telephone to ring with the order to scramble. \"For years afterwards,\" he wrote, \"the sound of a phone ringing two houses away would have me out of bed. I still hate the ringing of a telephone.\" He is survived by his wife, whom he married in 1940, a son, who is a serving army officer, and two daughters. \u0095 Air Vice-Marshal Alexander Vallance Ridell 'Sandy' Johnstone, airman and author, born June 2 1916; died December 13 2000",

Since slavery was abolished in 1865 at the end of the civil war, there has been no payment made in restitution to the descendants of slaves.</p> <p>There is, however, a growing movement of activists seeking reparation, and they regard the new law as a step towards their goal.</p> <p>Two Democrats, Jesse Jackson and John Conyers, have proposed legislation that would establish a federal commission to explore how reparation might be made. In declaring his support for the new law, Mr Jackson said: \"The nation must come to grips with the truth and consequences of its history.\"</p> <p>The largest insurance company in the US, Aetna Inc, has apologised for selling slave insurance policies in the 1850s, but so far no other company has declared such practices.</p> <p>Yesterday, Fred Laberge of Aetna said his company fully intended to comply with the law. As to whether the law could lead to moves for financial reparation, Mr Laberge said: \"It's hard for us to speculate.\"</p> <p>He did speculate, however, that it would be wrong to judge a company with a good record for diversity by the \"very different moral and ethical standards\" of a bygone era.</p> <p>Opponents of the law say that insurance companies are being unfairly singled out when almost all commercial enterprises at the time of slavery benefited directly or indirectly from the trade and the unpaid labour. Its supporters argue that it will remind Americans about a key part of their history.</p> <p>The issue of reparations has been raised before. In 1866 a \"black tax refund\", apparently based on the estimated value of 40 acres (16 hectares) and a mule, was laid out by Congress but vetoed by President Andrew Johnson.</p> <p>In 1963 in his book, Why We Can't Wait, the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King proposed a \"bill of rights for the disadvantaged\", in which he called for reparations.</p> <p>\"Not all the wealth of this affluent society could meet the bill. Yet a price can be placed on the unpaid wages,\" he said. \"The ancient common law has always provided a remedy for the appropriation of the labour of one human.\" He proposed a massive programme of compensation.</p> <p>The US government has in the past acted to compensate ethnic groups that have been exploited or mistreated; in 1988, it apologised and gave $20,000 (\u00a313,500) each to around 60,000 Japanese-Americans who were held in internment camps during the second world war.</p> <p>Reparation today remains a hot issue and one that is unlikely to subside. Only this month an elaborate fraud persuaded around 30,000 gullible Americans that the government owed them $5,000 (\u00a33,400) each as payment for the legacy of slavery.</p> <p>Con artists told elderly African-Americans that they were entitled to tax breaks as a result of a \"slave reparation act\" and offered - for a fee - to obtain tax refunds on their behalf.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A law about to come into effect in California could bolster the growing movement to compensate the descendants of slaves. From January 1 every insurance company operating in the state will have to declare any \"slave insurance\" policies it offered in the 19th century. The law will require companies to state which policies they offered to slave-owners for the death, loss, or injury of slaves the policy-holders had bought. It began life as a bill sponsored by the radical California senator Tom Hayden, and does not require the insurance company to pay recompense; rather, it seeks to act as an educational reminder of the history of slavery. In 1705, a slavery act was passed in Virginia requiring that \"Negro, mulatto and Indian slaves\" be considered as \"real estate\". Since slavery was abolished in 1865 at the end of the civil war, there has been no payment made in restitution to the descendants of slaves. There is, however, a growing movement of activists seeking reparation, and they regard the new law as a step towards their goal. Two Democrats, Jesse Jackson and John Conyers, have proposed legislation that would establish a federal commission to explore how reparation might be made. In declaring his support for the new law, Mr Jackson said: \"The nation must come to grips with the truth and consequences of its history.\" The largest insurance company in the US, Aetna Inc, has apologised for selling slave insurance policies in the 1850s, but so far no other company has declared such practices. Yesterday, Fred Laberge of Aetna said his company fully intended to comply with the law. As to whether the law could lead to moves for financial reparation, Mr Laberge said: \"It's hard for us to speculate.\" He did speculate, however, that it would be wrong to judge a company with a good record for diversity by the \"very different moral and ethical standards\" of a bygone era. Opponents of the law say that insurance companies are being unfairly singled out when almost all commercial enterprises at the time of slavery benefited directly or indirectly from the trade and the unpaid labour. Its supporters argue that it will remind Americans about a key part of their history. The issue of reparations has been raised before. In 1866 a \"black tax refund\", apparently based on the estimated value of 40 acres (16 hectares) and a mule, was laid out by Congress but vetoed by President Andrew Johnson. In 1963 in his book, Why We Can't Wait, the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King proposed a \"bill of rights for the disadvantaged\", in which he called for reparations. \"Not all the wealth of this affluent society could meet the bill. Yet a price can be placed on the unpaid wages,\" he said. \"The ancient common law has always provided a remedy for the appropriation of the labour of one human.\" He proposed a massive programme of compensation. The US government has in the past acted to compensate ethnic groups that have been exploited or mistreated; in 1988, it apologised and gave $20,000 (\u00a313,500) each to around 60,000 Japanese-Americans who were held in internment camps during the second world war. Reparation today remains a hot issue and one that is unlikely to subside. Only this month an elaborate fraud persuaded around 30,000 gullible Americans that the government owed them $5,000 (\u00a33,400) each as payment for the legacy of slavery. Con artists told elderly African-Americans that they were entitled to tax breaks as a result of a \"slave reparation act\" and offered - for a fee - to obtain tax refunds on their behalf.",

Supporters of President Vojislav Kostunica are forecast to win a landslide victory and secure control of Serbia's government, the most important power centre in Yugoslavia. The election should give Serbia its first government for more than 50 years not led by the Socialists or their communist predecessors. It will be a fresh humiliation for Slobodan Milosevic who was removed from power following a popular uprising. He remains controversially protected by a special army unit and police guard in Beli Dvor (White Palace), which was once the home of Marshal Tito, in the Belgrade suburb of Dedinje. The man who ought to live in the palace, the new federal president Mr Kostunica, is busy travelling around the world re-establishing ties that Mr Milosevic severed. In just two months since the 5 October uprising, when Serbia overthrew Mr Milosevic, Mr Kostunica has brought Yugoslavia back into the world community, rejoining the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and raising its long term aim of joining the European Union. During this time his popularity has soared to an unprecedented 91% approval rating. According to many opinion polls, members of the anti-Milosevic coalition, DOS (the Democratic Opposition of Serbia), will gain more than 70% of the vote. The latest survey showed DOS with 63% - which would translate into a larger majority in parliament, because some parties will not clear the 5% threshold. The Socialists, with a projected 13% of the vote, look set to win a few seats in parliament, but not to have any serious power. Two splinter parties will further divide the leftwing vote and the Yugoslav Left party of Mr Milosevic's wife Mira Markovic is not expected to gain a single seat. Rebeka Srbinovic, vice-president of the DOS party New Democracy, said it was important that in the elections, DOS wins more than two thirds of the seats in parliament. This would give them the mandate to change the Serbian constitution and jettison the one that Mr Milosevic tailor-made for himself.

Mr Djindjic has named the key cabinet positions and the only top post still in question is that of minister for police. The new police chief will take over from an ally of Milosevic, Rade Markovic, whom Mr Kostunica controversially kept in power. The minister will be responsible for overseeing the secret police and so will control access to the files that Mr Milosevic's secret service gathered on his political enemies - many of whom are now DOS leaders.",

      "body": "<p>\"Comment is free, but facts are sacred.\" When CP Scott, one of this newspaper's greatest editors, wrote his famous lines, he could count on general agreement - confident that intelligent readers were responsive to well-documented evidence and honoured a boundary between truth and interpretation, facts and their evaluation. </p> <p>Eighty years on, journalists no longer share that confidence: they're as puzzled as anyone at the apparent immunity to evidence of people's convictions. GM crops remain, for the general public, a sinister threat however patiently leading biologists and government scientific advisers present evidence to the contrary. </p> <p>Journalists are right to have lost Scott's confidence. But why? What's going on? There's nothing new in people sticking to their guns despite the evidence. We don't live by reason alone. But contemporary resilience to \"the facts\" is especially impressive. They bounce off people, leaving armour-plated convictions unscathed. Among the reasons are ones for which the media bear some responsibility - in particular, their promotion of images, stereotypes, that easily trump the actual evidence. In a debate dominated by the Frankenstein imagery of power crazy scientists violating life itself, and by a bucolic stereotype of organic farmers, their muddy boots planted firmly in our country's soil, the facts hardly get a look in. Between graphic imagery and sober commentary, there's no contest. </p> <p>But it's not simply that facts bounce off people: there are powerful currents in contemporary culture that erode the very distinction between fact and comment which Scott relied on his readers to respect. For a start, there's the postmodernist fashion - let loose from the confines of university literature departments - expressly to deny, \"deconstruct\", that distinction. Facts are what you can persuade your friends to accept, says one leader of that fashion.

      "bodyText": "\"Comment is free, but facts are sacred.\" When CP Scott, one of this newspaper's greatest editors, wrote his famous lines, he could count on general agreement - confident that intelligent readers were responsive to well-documented evidence and honoured a boundary between truth and interpretation, facts and their evaluation. Eighty years on, journalists no longer share that confidence: they're as puzzled as anyone at the apparent immunity to evidence of people's convictions. GM crops remain, for the general public, a sinister threat however patiently leading biologists and government scientific advisers present evidence to the contrary. Journalists are right to have lost Scott's confidence. But why? What's going on? There's nothing new in people sticking to their guns despite the evidence. We don't live by reason alone. But contemporary resilience to \"the facts\" is especially impressive. They bounce off people, leaving armour-plated convictions unscathed. Among the reasons are ones for which the media bear some responsibility - in particular, their promotion of images, stereotypes, that easily trump the actual evidence. In a debate dominated by the Frankenstein imagery of power crazy scientists violating life itself, and by a bucolic stereotype of organic farmers, their muddy boots planted firmly in our country's soil, the facts hardly get a look in. Between graphic imagery and sober commentary, there's no contest. But it's not simply that facts bounce off people: there are powerful currents in contemporary culture that erode the very distinction between fact and comment which Scott relied on his readers to respect. For a start, there's the postmodernist fashion - let loose from the confines of university literature departments - expressly to deny, \"deconstruct\", that distinction. Facts are what you can persuade your friends to accept, says one leader of that fashion. The Gulf war never took place, declaims another: his point being that actual events cannot be sifted from the virtual reality - the product of spin and presentation - on our TV screens. Spin, of course, has its own corrosive influence. When papers are keener to report the spin behind a story than the story itself, it's unsurprising that readers swallow any story only with a spoonful of salt. \"Who's peddling what?\" they ask cynically.

It is this belief that is considered blasphemous by hardline Islamists.</p> <p>In Pakistan, many Ahmadis are well educated and relatively wealthy, which, particularly in Takht Hazara, where they are in the minority, has caused years of jealousy.</p> <p>Ahmadi gravestones in the Takht Hazara cemetery have been smashed. Many in the community, including one of the men killed in last month's attack, had complained to the police about harassment, without result.</p> <p>Athar Shah, the local hardline Sunni Muslim mullah who led the mob that night and was injured in the attack, ran an anti-Ahmadi organisation from a small, wooden office in the village.</p> <p>\"The death of an apostate is better than the deaths of all the non-Muslims in the world,\" read a sign on his locked office door. Mr Shah, who is under arrest in Faisalabad, had tried to begin proceedings to have the Ahmadi mosque knocked down.</p> <p>On the night of the attack, the mob broke down two walls of the Ahmadi mosque and forced their way in.</p> <p>\"The crowd used axes on Nasir Ahmad,\" said Waseem Ahmad, a 22-year-old student who watched two of his cousins die. \"They cut his throat and then they threw him down on to the road.\"</p> <p>As he spoke, Nasir Ahmad's mother sat crouching in the mosque's burned out prayer hall rocking backwards and forwards as she sobbed into the bloody shawl her son had been wearing that night. The ceiling fans above her were bent crooked by the fire.</p> <p>Many of the Ahmadis in the village say they no longer notice the inflammatory signs. But their resentment is not hidden far below the surface.</p> <p>\"I am thinking I should kill half of this village,\" said Afzal Mehmood, 38, whose father and brother died in the attack. \"But our supreme head doesn't allow this.\"</p> <p>\"My family emigrated from India to Pakistan at the time of partition for protection because it was a Muslim state. It was supposed to be our beloved country,\" he said. \"Now India is a better place to be.\"</p> <p>Little is said in Pakistan's wordy newspapers about the Ahmadis or the country's other persecuted religious minority, the 2m Christians. Pakistan's Christians often live in city slums and, passed over for most jobs, they do the work no others will do.</p> <p>Both Ahmadis and Christians are regularly arrested under the sinister and arbitrary blasphemy law introduced by General Zia ul-Haq in 1985, which laid down the death penalty for anyone insulting the prophet Mohammed.</p> <p>\"There is a small lobby of mullahs who are pushing forward a campaign against minorities,\" said Kamila Hyat, joint director of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. \"The government should be clamping down, but it seems there is a tacit support for this.\"</p> <p>Pakistan's military leader, General Pervez Musharraf, proposed a slight amendment of the blasphemy law earlier this year which would have made prosecutions harder. But within days he backed down in the wake of furious criticism from Sunni Muslim leaders.</p> <p>\"The government is responsible for stopping not only the killings,\" said Ms Hyat, \"but also the preaching of hatred, which is against the law, and which keeps instigating the violence.\"</p>",

Pakistan's 3.5m Ahmadis belong to the only religion in the country which it is legal to discriminate against; it is illegal for them to call themselves Muslims, to describe their places of worship as mosques or for the muezzin to call the faithful to prayer five times a day. Although, like all Muslims, they believe in the prophet Mohammed, Ahmadis also believe the messiah was a man named Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who lived in Qadian, India, in the last century. It is this belief that is considered blasphemous by hardline Islamists. In Pakistan, many Ahmadis are well educated and relatively wealthy, which, particularly in Takht Hazara, where they are in the minority, has caused years of jealousy. Ahmadi gravestones in the Takht Hazara cemetery have been smashed. Many in the community, including one of the men killed in last month's attack, had complained to the police about harassment, without result. Athar Shah, the local hardline Sunni Muslim mullah who led the mob that night and was injured in the attack, ran an anti-Ahmadi organisation from a small, wooden office in the village. \"The death of an apostate is better than the deaths of all the non-Muslims in the world,\" read a sign on his locked office door. Mr Shah, who is under arrest in Faisalabad, had tried to begin proceedings to have the Ahmadi mosque knocked down. On the night of the attack, the mob broke down two walls of the Ahmadi mosque and forced their way in. \"The crowd used axes on Nasir Ahmad,\" said Waseem Ahmad, a 22-year-old student who watched two of his cousins die. \"They cut his throat and then they threw him down on to the road.\" As he spoke, Nasir Ahmad's mother sat crouching in the mosque's burned out prayer hall rocking backwards and forwards as she sobbed into the bloody shawl her son had been wearing that night. The ceiling fans above her were bent crooked by the fire. Many of the Ahmadis in the village say they no longer notice the inflammatory signs. But their resentment is not hidden far below the surface. \"I am thinking I should kill half of this village,\" said Afzal Mehmood, 38, whose father and brother died in the attack. \"But our supreme head doesn't allow this.\" \"My family emigrated from India to Pakistan at the time of partition for protection because it was a Muslim state. It was supposed to be our beloved country,\" he said. \"Now India is a better place to be.\" Little is said in Pakistan's wordy newspapers about the Ahmadis or the country's other persecuted religious minority, the 2m Christians. Pakistan's Christians often live in city slums and, passed over for most jobs, they do the work no others will do. Both Ahmadis and Christians are regularly arrested under the sinister and arbitrary blasphemy law introduced by General Zia ul-Haq in 1985, which laid down the death penalty for anyone insulting the prophet Mohammed. \"There is a small lobby of mullahs who are pushing forward a campaign against minorities,\" said Kamila Hyat, joint director of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan. \"The government should be clamping down, but it seems there is a tacit support for this.\" Pakistan's military leader, General Pervez Musharraf, proposed a slight amendment of the blasphemy law earlier this year which would have made prosecutions harder. But within days he backed down in the wake of furious criticism from Sunni Muslim leaders. \"The government is responsible for stopping not only the killings,\" said Ms Hyat, \"but also the preaching of hatred, which is against the law, and which keeps instigating the violence.\"",

      "bodyText": "Britain privately opposed the fresh round of United Nations sanctions imposed against Afghanistan this week, according to a security council source yesterday. Although Britain voted for the sanctions, in private British diplomats in New York worked up until the last minute to try to block them. The security council source said that the only outcome of the sanctions would be to make the already appalling humanitarian situation in Afghanistan even worse. The ruling Taliban reacted to the sanctions by pulling out of UN peace talks aimed at ending the civil war, and ordering a boycott of US and Russian goods - a largely meaningless gesture as few can afford such items. America and Russia, which formerly occupied Afghanistan, unusually joined forces in the security council to push through the sanctions, aimed at the Taliban government in Kabul. UN staff were pulled out on the orders of the New York headquarters fearful of Taliban retaliation. The security council source said: \"This was all predictable. The Taliban reaction was predictable. Whether it is the fault of the Taliban or our action, the people who are going to be hurt on the ground are the people of Afghanistan.\" UN sanctions were imposed against the Taliban government last year. The latest round includes a ban on arms to the Taliban and more flight restrictions. The sanctions are largely symbolic: the Afghan economy is in such disrepair that they will have little impact. The US is keen to keep up pressure on Afghanistan to hand over Osama bin Laden, the terrorist accused of bombing US embassies in east Africa in 1998 and suspected of involvement in the recent attack on USS Cole in Yemen. The sanctions will come into force if Bin Laden is not handed over by next month, but the Taliban government claims there is insufficient evidence against him. Britain was joined in its scepticism about the value of the sanctions by Canada and the Netherlands. \"If it had not been put on the table, we would not have dreamt it up,\" one of the diplomats involved said. The security council source said that, in addition to worries about the humanitarian impact, the big question was: \"How can we possibly implement these sanctions? \" The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, took the unusual step on Tuesday, the day the resolution was passed, of warning that it would harm the UN's humanitarian work and do little to help the peace process. The World Food Programme said yesterday that it had begun to ship food aid through Iran to Afghanistan to fight a potential famine brought on by the worst drought in 30 years. It said up to 12m Afghans were affected by the four-month-old drought, 3-4m of them severely, with thousands forced to migrate to urban centres.

For many months their parents assumed they had been shot by bandits or fallen prey to the natural dangers of the area.</p> <p>But the two men had been abducted by guerrillas, who on December 10 suddenly released them.</p> <p>After getting hopelessly lost in the dense jungle, they were forced to return to the guerrillas six days later to ask for a map, before finally stumbling across an astounded park ranger on December 19. After a night's rest at the British embassy in Bogota, and a medical checkup and debriefing with the Colombian authorities, they were put on to a British Airways flight home</p> <p>The pair seemed elated but dazed as they were greeted by relatives at Gatwick yesterday afternoon. \"Forty-eight hours ago we were in the jungle and then we were whisked from motorboat to plane to house and suddenly here we are back on British soil. Amazing,\" said Mr Winder.</p> <p>Weals were visible on the feet of Mr Hart Dyke, who was wearing flip flops, but like his companion he seemed otherwise unscathed. He said they had shared extraordinary camaraderie with the guerrillas - even stopping for a drink and a cigarette when they returned to ask for the map - but had been terrified when first captured.</p> <p>He recalled: \"Initially they used their guns to get us on to the ground, they tied us up for half an hour and said 'Are you going to run?'

      "bodyText": "Two kidnapped Britons yesterday relived the \"rollercoaster of emotion\" they had experienced during nine months in the Colombian rain forest, as they arrived home in time for Christmas. Paul Winder, 29, a merchant banker, and Tom Hart Dyke, 24, a horticulturist, vanished in March while hunting for rare orchids in the Darien Gap, one of Colombia's most dangerous regions. For many months their parents assumed they had been shot by bandits or fallen prey to the natural dangers of the area. But the two men had been abducted by guerrillas, who on December 10 suddenly released them. After getting hopelessly lost in the dense jungle, they were forced to return to the guerrillas six days later to ask for a map, before finally stumbling across an astounded park ranger on December 19. After a night's rest at the British embassy in Bogota, and a medical checkup and debriefing with the Colombian authorities, they were put on to a British Airways flight home The pair seemed elated but dazed as they were greeted by relatives at Gatwick yesterday afternoon. \"Forty-eight hours ago we were in the jungle and then we were whisked from motorboat to plane to house and suddenly here we are back on British soil. Amazing,\" said Mr Winder. Weals were visible on the feet of Mr Hart Dyke, who was wearing flip flops, but like his companion he seemed otherwise unscathed. He said they had shared extraordinary camaraderie with the guerrillas - even stopping for a drink and a cigarette when they returned to ask for the map - but had been terrified when first captured. He recalled: \"Initially they used their guns to get us on to the ground, they tied us up for half an hour and said 'Are you going to run?' After that it never happened again.\" Their captors treated them well, built them a bed and gave Mr Winder antibiotics for a foot infection. They showed Mr Hart Dyke the rare orchids he had been looking for and he joked that he had even put on weight thanks to their diet of beef and bananas. But inevitably the Britons struggled to cope with the harsh terrain as the rebels kept them moving to avoid discovery. \"We're not used to living in that environment. They [the guerrillas] are very strong people and we couldn't always keep up with them, but we always did our best. It was a team effort,\" said Mr Winder. \"We tried to live off each other. There were low times, high times, terrifying times and fantastic times. \"It was a huge roller-coaster of emotion.\" He added: \"We always had confidence that we would get back to England and see our families.\" The two Englishmen met in Puerto Rico. Mr Winder had travelled extensively in Africa and south-east Asia, and Mr Hart Dyke had spent the past two years travelling the world in search of rare orchids. But the Darien Gap is pristine tropical rainforest, with no marked paths or bridges, and its natural predators include alligators, panthers and venomous snakes. Bandits, drugs and arms-smugglers are rife and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are active in the area. Farc is responsible for most abductions in Colombia, which number 3,000 this year. However the guerrillas in question did not identify themselves to their captives or explained the purpose of the kidnapping, and although at one point they did tell Mr Winder that they would demand a ransom of $5m (about \u00a33.3m) for each man, they never did. During the months that the pair's fate remained unknown, Mr Winder's father, Brian, and Mr Hart Dyke's mother, Sarah, flew out to search for their sons. Yesterday, Mr Hart Dyke's father, Guy, told reporters: \"This is the best Christmas present I have ever had\" - before driving the family home to Lullingstone castle, in Kent.

The arrests follow bomb attacks against British citizens living in Saudi Arabia. The Britons, who have not been named, were arrested more than a week ago. A Belgian and a Lebanese are also believed to have been detained. Alcohol is illegal in the kingdom. The penalties for importing, manufacturing or possessing it include jail sentences or public flogging. Unofficial sources said that during the bomb investigations the Saudi authorities uncovered what they suspected was an illicit alcohol ring. Christopher Rodway, 47, an engineer from Gloucestershire who worked at a military hospital in Riyadh, died when a bomb exploded in his car on November 17, also injuring his wife. Six days later, three Britons and an Irish woman were injured by a similar car bomb in the capital. Last Friday, David Brown, 32, a Briton working for Coca Cola International, lost an eye and suffered injuries to his hand when a juice carton placed near the windscreen of his car exploded in the eastern town of al-Khobar. No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks, and Saudi officials have suggested the first two attacks might have been carried out for personal rather than political motives. A Saudi newspaper said last week they could be linked to \"illegal activity such as distribution of liquor\". Yesterday, the Saudi-owned al-Hayat newspaper reported that a Belgian and a Lebanese had been arrested within the \"framework\" of the bomb investigation on suspicion of involvement in smuggling and selling \"forbidden things\" - a term which includes alcohol. Sa'ad Fagih, of the opposition Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, told the Guardian he had received information that 50 people had been arrested: up to 10 Europeans and about 40 Saudis. Dr Fagih said he believed the attacks had been carried out by jihad groups and that the Saudi authorities, reluctant to admit any threat to the kingdom's stability, were using the alcohol investigation \"to divert attention from the real cause\".",

      "bodyText": "He was born in April 1960 in the Algerian internment camp of Theniet el-Had, the son of a 16-year-old local girl and an unknown French officer, one of 30 or 40 who raped her, repeatedly and brutally, during a period of months. It took him 12 years and three court actions in Algeria to establish those facts. Yesterday, after another two years of legal wrangling in France, a French court agreed to look further into Mohammed Garne's claim that the simple fact of his birth made him a \"victim of war\". Mr Garne's case, the first of its kind in French legal history, comes as a divided France embarks on a renewed and bitter bout of soul-searching for the conduct of its soldiers during Algeria's savage 1954-1962 war of independence - in particular their use of torture. A military pensions tribunal in March threw out his claim for compensation on the grounds that, although he was \"born of a rape perpetrated on his mother by French officers\", he was not \"the direct victim of this act of violence\", and it could not be proved that his subsequent psychological problems were uniquely due to it. The Paris appeal court verdict represented a victory of sorts. The court said it would give an expert six months to investigate and report back to it on all aspects of Mr Garne's claim. \"Of course I'm pleased,\" he said. \"It is a step towards achieving the one thing I want: recognition of the crime of which I have been a victim.\" Mr Garne, a caretaker in a Paris department store, said he did not want to find his father, nor to seek his punishment. \"Recognition is all I seek,\" he said. \"There are many of us in Algeria, children born of French army rapes. It is necessary that this is said and recognised in France. Otherwise it will be forever a stain on its history.\" Whether France should officially recognise the atrocities committed by its troops in Algeria has become the subject of a heated and at times venomous debate this year, launched in the summer when Le Monde published a shocking interview with an Algerian woman, Louisette Ighilahriz. In horrific detail, Ms Inghilahriz described how as a young pro-independence fighter in the late 1950s she was tortured three times a day for more than three months, left handcuffed to a steel bed, and lying in her own excrement between sessions. Such allegations were not, of course, new. During the conflict, demonstrators protested at length about the use of la g\u00e9g\u00e8ne, a torture technique involving electrodes clamped to the genitals, ears and tongue. For years since, rumours have circulated and old soldiers have hinted that the bloody savagery of the pro-independence guerrillas - the slit throats, bayonetted stomachs and sliced ears - was more than matched by the barbarity of French troops. The army, while refusing to comment on specific allegations, always insisted that whatever happened was militarily justified since it saved lives. After Ms Inghilahriz's account of her torture, however, a senior army figure, General Jacques Massu, 92, admitted for the first time to Le Monde that torture was \"institutional\" in the French army at the time, and that it served no military purpose. \"Morally, torture is dismal,\" he said. \"I think it would be a positive thing to recognise and condemn what happened.\" Gen Massu added that the blame should be placed not on the army, but on politicians who gave the order to break up rebel cells at any cost. Newspapers rapidly began to fill with letters from two camps: embittered former officers fearful that their records would be sullied, and some of the estimated 2m conscripts who served in Algeria, witnessed or took part in atrocities, and felt shame for having stayed silent. Another retired general, Paul Aussaresses, said he personally had killed 24 suspected guerrilla chiefs during the 1957 battle of Algiers, and that some 3,000 other suspects had been killed, their bodies \"made to disappear\". He had, he confessed, \"used methods that are not approved by the laws of warfare\". When Amnesty International called on France to put both generals on trial, the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, intervened. He said the issue was \"not one for which France can accuse itself and blame itself globally\". Mr Garne's story, however, has finally been told. When the French troops who were holding his mother discovered she was pregnant, she was savagely beaten in an attempt to make her lose the child. He was born with physical and mental infirmities, was immediately given up to an orphanage and later to a foster family, who also abused him. \"It seems to me I have always been unbalanced, somehow,\" he said. \"In any event, I have never been happy. But what tortured me more than anything was not knowing who my father was.

The standoff at Canakkale prison in western Turkey ended earlier yesterday, with the interior ministry saying that two more prisoners had been found dead, taking the official death toll in the raids to 19 inmates and two soldiers.</p> <p>NTV television showed some of the Canakkale inmates jumping out of a hole soldiers had smashed in a prison wall and crawling towards the heavily armed security forces.</p> <p>Earlier, soldiers shouted \"Life is beautiful\" and \"If you are not thinking of yourselves, think of your parents waiting in front of the prison\" through megaphones, the daily Milliyet reported.</p> <p>Parliament yesterday approved an amnesty that will nearly halve the country's prison population of 72,000 and help end overcrowding. Parliament passed the amnesty bill for the second time after President Ahmet Necdet Sezer had previously vetoed it. Turkish presidents cannot veto a bill twice.</p> <p>Officials have said it is vital for Turkey to reduce jail numbers as it struggles to regain control of prisons where inmates often live in wards that house up to 100 people.</p> <p>Political groups frequently run wards like indoctrination centres and bar warders from entering.

      "bodyText": "Soldiers pressed defiant inmates to end their standoff in the last Turkish prison holding out against authorities, after more than 150 left-wing inmates in another jail surrendered. Prisoners across the country had embarked on a two-month hunger strike to protest at plans to move them from huge, packed prison wards to small cells. After three days of raids on more than 20 prisons, 400 inmates remained barricaded in Istanbul's Umraniye prison. The standoff at Canakkale prison in western Turkey ended earlier yesterday, with the interior ministry saying that two more prisoners had been found dead, taking the official death toll in the raids to 19 inmates and two soldiers. NTV television showed some of the Canakkale inmates jumping out of a hole soldiers had smashed in a prison wall and crawling towards the heavily armed security forces. Earlier, soldiers shouted \"Life is beautiful\" and \"If you are not thinking of yourselves, think of your parents waiting in front of the prison\" through megaphones, the daily Milliyet reported. Parliament yesterday approved an amnesty that will nearly halve the country's prison population of 72,000 and help end overcrowding. Parliament passed the amnesty bill for the second time after President Ahmet Necdet Sezer had previously vetoed it. Turkish presidents cannot veto a bill twice. Officials have said it is vital for Turkey to reduce jail numbers as it struggles to regain control of prisons where inmates often live in wards that house up to 100 people. Political groups frequently run wards like indoctrination centres and bar warders from entering. Poorly paid guards are bribed and threatened and telephones and weapons smuggled in. Convicted murderers and thieves will benefit from the amnesty, but rapists, corrupt state officials, drug traffickers and those accused of crimes against the state, such as Kurdish guerrillas and leftwing and Islamic militants, will not. Although hundreds have demonstrated in the streets in support of the prisoners, the police raids appear to have been popular. The prisoners are mostly from fringe groups that have little support and many Turks have been critical of the government for not reining in the prisoners earlier. \"It is ... a great shame that the state has allowed the current mess in the prisons to prevail for so long without taking effective steps,\" wrote Ilnur Cevik, editor-in-chief of the Turkish Daily News. The newspaper Radikal quoted the interior minister, Sadettin Tantan, as saying that the government had chosen to take the \"slow road\" and use psychological warfare to end the siege. At Umraniye prison shots were heard throughout the day, the independent Human Rights Association said. Security forces, throwing tear gas from holes drilled in the prison, were closing in on the prisoners who had barricaded themselves in, the news agency Anatolia said.

      "byline": "Interview by Sally Weale",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Five months ago, G\u00e9rard Depardieu went into hospital for a check up. He had been feeling below par, a bit tired, and suspected something was wrong. He drove himself to the clinic on his motorbike, went in for some tests and only emerged after undergoing emergency open-heart surgery, which saved his life. </p> <p>When we meet in a sedate little Chelsea hotel, Depardieu does not look in the least bit chastened by the experience. I was expecting a thinner, fitter, healthier post-operative Depardieu, but he is none of these. He is huge - not especially tall, perhaps 5ft 11ins, but his torso, which seems to be fixed to his head without the benefit of a neck, is the size of two men rolled into one. </p> <p>Like a circus acrobat at the bottom of a human pyramid, his legs are spread wide to carry the load and his face - dominated by that extraordinary phallic nose - is carnation pink with the effort. </p> <p>For most of us, dramatic medical intervention is life-changing. It's a chance to reflect; a brush with mortality, a warning; you give up the cigarettes, cut down on alcohol, promise yourself a saner, healthier lifestyle. But, at 51, Depardieu has had more brushes with mortality than most. </p> <p>Two years ago he survived a high-speed motorbike accident when he was five times over the limit; in 1996 he escaped unhurt when a small plane he was in collided with a Boeing 727 on the ground at Madrid airport; and his violent childhood, spent among prostitutes and petty criminals, is the stuff of legend. What's so exciting about open heart surgery? </p> <p>Today, Depardieu is grumpy. He is in Britain on a flying visit to publicise his television series, The Count of Monte Cristo. It's all very last minute and Depardieu clearly has not enjoyed his 45 minutes with another interviewer, who emerges looking shaken. </p> <p>He snaps miserably at the French woman who has kindly volunteered to help me out as an interpreter when she is unable to translate something he has said - his subsequent apology reduces her to tears - and the BBC PR and hotel staff tiptoe around him. </p> <p>Usually, when you interview celebrities in their hotel suite, the rooms are untouched, unlived in. Depardieu's room looks as though it has been ravished. The bed is dented and crumpled, a dressing gown is tossed across it; towelling mule slippers are scrunched up next to the bed and the door to the garden is flung wide open, letting in the winter chill. </p> <p>\"When you have heart disease you start to be tired of everything,\" he says. \"It's like getting older. You become more white and after that grey. You have no feeling for anything.\" Not trusting my amateur interpreter, Depardieu speaks in a mixture of French and imperfect English, but his mood shifts quickly from irritated to charming. </p> <p>\"I thought maybe it's time to have a check up. I thought, deep down, I'm sure I have something, but I won't mention it to anybody. I will see.\" He finished the film he was doing and made a hospital appointment. \"I arrived on my motorbike and I thought I would be leaving. But the doctor said, 'No, G\u00e9rard. No, I don't think so. I don't think you can go out.\" They did a test and showed me my heart on the screen and I could see what was wrong. I said, 'Yes! I can see! You want to do a real operation. Yes!' \" </p> <p>An hour later he called the director of his next film and explained he had to have a multiple bypass. They prepared him for theatre; he asked the medical team to put on some music (it was, he remembers, She, the theme tune from the film Notting Hill); he told his doctors he had the utmost confidence in them and went to sleep. And that was that. Four weeks later he was back at work and in the three months after his operation he made three movies - more than some leading actors do in a decade. </p> <p>Which is part of the problem with Depardieu - his excessiveness in all things. He is fantastically hard working, in movie terms at least. John Updike once poetically complained \"I think that I shall never view/ A French film without Depardieu.\" He does a minimum of three films a year, notching up more than 100 in total (plus television projects), and because of the sheer quantity (and dubious quality of some), you forget just how many brilliant performances he has pulled off. </p> <p>Look at his filmography: there's Cyrano de Bergerac, Trop Belle Pour Toi, Jean de Florette, Police, Danton, The Return of Martin Guerre; Colonel Chabert, Tous Les Matins du Monde, Camille Claudel, 1900. It's an extraordinary achievement for someone who, by his own admission, has done some \"grosse merde\" in his time. </p> <p>Depardieu is an actor who follows his instincts, both in his choice of work and his approach to a role. Yves Angelo, who directed him in Le Colonel Chabert, describes him thus: \"An animal, but warm and generous; you can tame him. He has to like the person who takes him in hand. He acts purely on instinct, but if he likes you, he has this astonishing instinct for the part.\" If it is not instinctive, then he becomes \"a very commonplace, even a bad actor\". </p> <p>But what on earth makes him do films like Bimboland (1998); Asterix and Obelix Take on Caesar (1999), and 102 Dalmatians? \"I follow friends, I follow the energy, I still have the instinct to go.\" He tries to explain that he is not so much interested in the film itself, but in the people he works with. \"Look, life is short - that motorbike accident, open heart surgery. La vie est fragile. Cigarettes, wine, love...\" I think he's trying to say there are better things in life to worry about than movies, rather than making me an offer. </p> <p>Depardieu's extraordinary acting talent grew out of an extraordinary early life that has been mythologised over the years, but the bare bones are these: he was born the third of six children of an illiterate father in Chteauroux, 160 miles south of Paris. His father was a sheet metal worker and a drunk. His mother once told him that she considered aborting him with a knitting needle. </p> <p>At the age of 12, Depardieu ran away from home to live with two prostitutes called Michelle and Ir\u00e8ne; he got involved in petty theft, the black market and brawling, and ended up briefly in prison. But after years of delinquency, at 16 he arrived in Paris, auditioned for the Th\u00e9tre Nationale Populaire and, once he had overcome a stammer which severely damaged his self-esteem, became a star pupil, making his big break with Bertrand Blier's Les Valseuses (1974) in which he plays a feckless thug. </p> <p>\"Twenty years ago he was extremely dangerous,\" Blier says, recalling the young Depardieu. \"We literally had to follow him at night to stop him getting into punch-ups. He would deliberately go into the most dangerous areas, looking for trouble. Even now when he arrives at the door, I think, Christ, where are the valuables?\" </p> <p>Depardieu has never quite translated his talent to Hollywood - there was Green Card (1990), which was successful, but not Depardieu at his best.

      "bodyText": "Five months ago, G\u00e9rard Depardieu went into hospital for a check up. He had been feeling below par, a bit tired, and suspected something was wrong. He drove himself to the clinic on his motorbike, went in for some tests and only emerged after undergoing emergency open-heart surgery, which saved his life. When we meet in a sedate little Chelsea hotel, Depardieu does not look in the least bit chastened by the experience. I was expecting a thinner, fitter, healthier post-operative Depardieu, but he is none of these. He is huge - not especially tall, perhaps 5ft 11ins, but his torso, which seems to be fixed to his head without the benefit of a neck, is the size of two men rolled into one. Like a circus acrobat at the bottom of a human pyramid, his legs are spread wide to carry the load and his face - dominated by that extraordinary phallic nose - is carnation pink with the effort. For most of us, dramatic medical intervention is life-changing. It's a chance to reflect; a brush with mortality, a warning; you give up the cigarettes, cut down on alcohol, promise yourself a saner, healthier lifestyle. But, at 51, Depardieu has had more brushes with mortality than most. Two years ago he survived a high-speed motorbike accident when he was five times over the limit; in 1996 he escaped unhurt when a small plane he was in collided with a Boeing 727 on the ground at Madrid airport; and his violent childhood, spent among prostitutes and petty criminals, is the stuff of legend. What's so exciting about open heart surgery? Today, Depardieu is grumpy. He is in Britain on a flying visit to publicise his television series, The Count of Monte Cristo. It's all very last minute and Depardieu clearly has not enjoyed his 45 minutes with another interviewer, who emerges looking shaken. He snaps miserably at the French woman who has kindly volunteered to help me out as an interpreter when she is unable to translate something he has said - his subsequent apology reduces her to tears - and the BBC PR and hotel staff tiptoe around him. Usually, when you interview celebrities in their hotel suite, the rooms are untouched, unlived in. Depardieu's room looks as though it has been ravished. The bed is dented and crumpled, a dressing gown is tossed across it; towelling mule slippers are scrunched up next to the bed and the door to the garden is flung wide open, letting in the winter chill. \"When you have heart disease you start to be tired of everything,\" he says. \"It's like getting older. You become more white and after that grey. You have no feeling for anything.\" Not trusting my amateur interpreter, Depardieu speaks in a mixture of French and imperfect English, but his mood shifts quickly from irritated to charming. \"I thought maybe it's time to have a check up. I thought, deep down, I'm sure I have something, but I won't mention it to anybody. I will see.\" He finished the film he was doing and made a hospital appointment. \"I arrived on my motorbike and I thought I would be leaving. But the doctor said, 'No, G\u00e9rard. No, I don't think so. I don't think you can go out.\" They did a test and showed me my heart on the screen and I could see what was wrong. I said, 'Yes! I can see! You want to do a real operation. Yes!' \" An hour later he called the director of his next film and explained he had to have a multiple bypass. They prepared him for theatre; he asked the medical team to put on some music (it was, he remembers, She, the theme tune from the film Notting Hill); he told his doctors he had the utmost confidence in them and went to sleep. And that was that. Four weeks later he was back at work and in the three months after his operation he made three movies - more than some leading actors do in a decade. Which is part of the problem with Depardieu - his excessiveness in all things. He is fantastically hard working, in movie terms at least. John Updike once poetically complained \"I think that I shall never view/ A French film without Depardieu.\" He does a minimum of three films a year, notching up more than 100 in total (plus television projects), and because of the sheer quantity (and dubious quality of some), you forget just how many brilliant performances he has pulled off. Look at his filmography: there's Cyrano de Bergerac, Trop Belle Pour Toi, Jean de Florette, Police, Danton, The Return of Martin Guerre; Colonel Chabert, Tous Les Matins du Monde, Camille Claudel, 1900. It's an extraordinary achievement for someone who, by his own admission, has done some \"grosse merde\" in his time. Depardieu is an actor who follows his instincts, both in his choice of work and his approach to a role. Yves Angelo, who directed him in Le Colonel Chabert, describes him thus: \"An animal, but warm and generous; you can tame him. He has to like the person who takes him in hand. He acts purely on instinct, but if he likes you, he has this astonishing instinct for the part.\" If it is not instinctive, then he becomes \"a very commonplace, even a bad actor\". But what on earth makes him do films like Bimboland (1998); Asterix and Obelix Take on Caesar (1999), and 102 Dalmatians? \"I follow friends, I follow the energy, I still have the instinct to go.\" He tries to explain that he is not so much interested in the film itself, but in the people he works with. \"Look, life is short - that motorbike accident, open heart surgery. La vie est fragile. Cigarettes, wine, love...\" I think he's trying to say there are better things in life to worry about than movies, rather than making me an offer. Depardieu's extraordinary acting talent grew out of an extraordinary early life that has been mythologised over the years, but the bare bones are these: he was born the third of six children of an illiterate father in Chteauroux, 160 miles south of Paris. His father was a sheet metal worker and a drunk. His mother once told him that she considered aborting him with a knitting needle. At the age of 12, Depardieu ran away from home to live with two prostitutes called Michelle and Ir\u00e8ne; he got involved in petty theft, the black market and brawling, and ended up briefly in prison. But after years of delinquency, at 16 he arrived in Paris, auditioned for the Th\u00e9tre Nationale Populaire and, once he had overcome a stammer which severely damaged his self-esteem, became a star pupil, making his big break with Bertrand Blier's Les Valseuses (1974) in which he plays a feckless thug. \"Twenty years ago he was extremely dangerous,\" Blier says, recalling the young Depardieu. \"We literally had to follow him at night to stop him getting into punch-ups. He would deliberately go into the most dangerous areas, looking for trouble. Even now when he arrives at the door, I think, Christ, where are the valuables?\" Depardieu has never quite translated his talent to Hollywood - there was Green Card (1990), which was successful, but not Depardieu at his best. He was on the brink of achieving mass popularity in the US with Cyrano de Bergerac (1990) - which he cites as the one film of which he is most proud and for which he was Oscar-nominated - when his fortunes took a dramatic dive. Just before the Academy Awards ceremony, Time magazine ran a profile that mistakenly suggested that the actor might have \"participated\" in a rape at the age of nine. The claim was based on an interview carried out 13 years earlier and was the result of an incorrect translation - Depardieu, though the clear favourite, did not win the Oscar. Today he is careful about translators and dismissive of Hollywood. \"I don't care about Hollywood films. I'm not against Hollywood films, you know?

Co-productions or UK productions which appear to be headed straight for the twilight netherworld of cable TV in the United States starring tousle-haired American kids in cutesy English country settings that only exist within the heads of raddled US movie executives, populated by British actors behind whose eyes you can see the flash of dismay and panic as they mouth the lines allotted to them and lumbering Americans who are not merely restricted to having English as a second language, but appear to have learned to move and behave in a homo sapiens-like manner the day before yesterday. Rik Mayall is Merlin, defending \"King Arthur Pendragon\" (Patrick Bergin - managing, just, to keep his dignity) against the depredations of the wicked Mordred (Craig Sheffer) and his crazed mother who shouts things like: \"Move your arse and pass that wine!\" Or is that Arthur's mother? Either way, it isn't a line that appears in Malory. For some reason, Mordred has made telepathic contact fifteen hundred years into the future with Joan Maxwell, an evil scientist played by Tia Carrere, whose appalling researches will enable Mordred to advance his unspeakable plans. Or something. Anyway, it in this modern-day era that American kid Ritchie Gould (Byron Taylor) living in England will do battle with Maxwell - and all the Arthurian knights are incongruously transported into modern Britain for the big showdown. The oddest thing is that people keep shouting: \"Look! There's Maxwell!\" And you expect Captain Bob himself to blunder into shot. The most uproarious thing about this quite dreadful film is Lancelot, played by hunky, long-haired Adrian Paul, an alumnus of the Colbys and Dynasty. Adrian attempts an English accent that makes him sound like a stroke victim. Poor Rik Mayall does his best, but keeps flinching and sneering in a very Alan B'Stard-like way. Any parent caught taking their unfortunate child to see this film should be reported to the social services immediately.",

Poor Kate tearfully thinks this might split them up forever - but Jack says it's only temporary and they can't pass up these career opportunities. \"You've got a place at one of the best law schools in the country,\" he says earnestly, \"and I've got this internship at Barclays bank.\" </p> <p>Er, hello?

We join him just as he has bullied all his modern-day Cratchits into coming into the office for a meeting on December 25. On Christmas Eve, Jack drops into a Korean corner-store to encounter a young gun-wielding punk called Cash (Don Cheadle), who looks deep into Jack's eyes and tells him to expect a \"glimpse\" of how his life might have been. And next morning, he wakes up married to Kate, with two kids and a low-paying job in New Jersey. He panics, of course, at this suburban hell, tries to get back into his office and spiffy apartment and is repulsed by various baffled doormen.

Is that his \"glimpse\"? </p> <p> Then there's Kate. She's still supposed to be a lawyer, of course, while Jack has stayed in Smallsville to help her father in his tyre shop after he had a heart attack. There's many a reference to her low-paying \"pro bono\" work - and Cage's face is never more equine than when he reverently repeats this Latinism - but we never get to see her working in any breadwinning capacity. To all intents and purposes she is the Stepford Wife, but a thousand times more creepy and dull than the robots because she is supposed to be the perfect mom, living for nothing more than the inexcusably cute things Jack does every year to celebrate their anniversary. After an adorable scene where they smear chocolate cake over each other's faces (an unwatchable sequence in itself), sweet Kate smoochingly whispers to Jack to say what she loves to hear.

In fact, I was eager to propose, and delighted that the chancellor has accepted, the idea that the consumer will be best served by arming the OFT with specific powers and resources to deal with competition problems in payment systems.\" The major banks gave a low-key reception to the proposals. A Barclays spokeswoman said: \"We are studying the proposals. It is sensible to use an existing regulator rather than go through the expense and time of setting up a new one.\" Consumer groups expressed concern that the proposals do not go far enough. Stuart Cliffe, spokesman for the National Association of Bank Customers, said: \"This falls short of what was proposed by Don Cruickshank. \"We are relieved that someone has responsibility for keeping a check on the industry, but it should have been a regulatory body with no other responsibilities, not the OFT, which already has plenty of other matters to worry about.\"",

Still in his early 30s, Goerne is perhaps the most exciting Lieder singer to have emerged during the last few years. His voice is extraordinary - smooth, pure and intoxicating - and this is bound up with an intense, compelling stage presence and absolute commitment to the music he sings. His programme consisted of songs by Mahler, all but two of them settings of the various folk verses and ballads contained in Des Knaben Wunderhorn. </p> <p>Some of these are tragic, some flippant, some bleakly romantic. Goerne chose to up the intensity by performing together groups of songs with a similar feel, with no interjections of conflicting moods. The result was a remarkable recital. The warmth and resonance in Goerne's voice was apparent from his very first notes, and ample demonstrations of a formidable technical agility followed shortly afterwards. There are few people who can sing high notes so quietly and yet so evenly. </p> <p>Indeed, one rarely can criticise performers for sounding too well prepared, but Goerne's technique seems so safe and secure that there is little he can do that will sound to the audience like a risk. It is the rough edges - even the barely perceptible ones - that go towards making a live performance more exciting than a recording, and Goerne's performances are almost too thoughtful, too polished. </p> <p>Having said that, there were many points during the evening at which the audience was hanging on Goerne's every note - the last phrase of Urlicht (the song that Mahler included in his Second Symphony), the final Gute Nacht of the drummer-boy's song. A thrillingly strong crescendo in the penultimate verse of Der Schildwache Nachtlied was transformed in an instant into the enchantingly soft closing phrases. Though usually presenting a serious face, eyes staring or brow furrowed in concentration, Goerne switched from doom-laden lover to raconteur for five light-hearted settings. Lob des hohen Verstandes found him imitating cuckoos, donkeys and nightingales with equal earnestness. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the pianist Eric Schneider didn't share his confidence and sounded nervous from the start. It's obvious that Goerne enjoys working with Schneider but, on the strength of this performance, he seems to have outclassed his accompanist. Many of these songs were originally written with full orchestra rather than keyboard in mind, but the piano reductions failed to sparkle and Mahler's wide palette of instrumental colour was left largely to the listener's imagination. Goerne still carried this recital off effortlessly, but left us wondering what he could accomplish with a pianist of a similarly high calibre.</p>",
