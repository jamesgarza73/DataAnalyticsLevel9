We were without our first-choice goalkeeper, centre-backs, a number of midfielders and our top scorer [the suspended Alan Smith] but I am delighted.\"",

      "body": "<p>Global stock markets yesterday threatened a repeat of Black Monday on the eve of the anniversary of the 1987 market meltdown. </p> <p>The panic began on Wall Street where worse than expected figures from computer company IBM and Chase Manhattan bank sent shares into freefall. Investors were further unsettled by news that inflation is heading higher - making it harder for the US federal reserve to cut interest rates to prevent the economy slowing. </p> <p>The Dow Jones fell more than 400 points to a low of 9,654 within minutes of New York's opening bell, the first time it had been below the 10,000 level for seven months. The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index was even harder hit, shedding 5% at one point. </p> <p>In a move which briefly revived memories of October 19, 1987 when the London stock market lost 11% of its value - and a further 12% the following day - the FTSE 100 share index mirrored Wall Street's headlong plunge, rapidly losing almost 200 points at one stage to stand only a fraction above 6,000 points. </p> <p>European markets took a hammering too, with hi-techs especially in the firing line. But as the markets plunged to some of the worst levels seen this year bargain hunters moved in and brought a measure of recovery to hard pressed markets. The Dow cuts its loses to less than 200 points, Nasdaq's recovery saw it back into positive territory and London trimmed its loss to less than a third of the original slump. </p> <p>\"It is still not looking terribly good. Even though we have seen some recovery I don't think it necessarily implies we have reached the bottom,\" said Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC in London. </p> <p>Inflationary pressures have already raised the cost of borrowing in the US and are expected to hit discretionary spending on items such as computers, prompting a sell-off of computer shares. </p> <p>Several of the world's largest technology companies have already warned of weaker revenues going forward and yesterday's news from IBM took 20% off its shares yesterday morning. </p> <p>Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics, said investors would not forgive signs of weakness in the current climate. \"We are in a bear market. Any piece of bad news results in a stock being hammered, while any good news is ignored.\" </p> <p>All but the most defensive food and drug companies were hit by concerns over rising inflation. The consumer price index released by the government yesterday showed that prices for goods such as clothes and tobacco had risen at their fastest pace for six months. </p> <p>The headline CPI rate, which included the rising price of oil, rose 0.5%, after dropping 0.1% in August. Clothing prices showed the biggest increase in 10 years, while housing, health care and tobacco all increased. </p> <p>Investors, which have pushed the Dow and Nasdaq to record highs, this year, now fear that they have been too optimistic about future profits. </p> <p>In the current climate, few analysts would predict whether shares were close to bottoming out yesterday in spite of a 40% fall in the Nasdaq and a 16% decline in the Dow. </p> <p>Mr Shepherdson said he felt technology shares which had been seriously overvalued, were now back in line with the market. Intel, which sparked this latest round of selling with a profits warning last month, is trading at about 34 times forecast 2000 earnings, he said, in line with the average for the S&amp;P 500 group of shares.</p>",

The Dow Jones fell more than 400 points to a low of 9,654 within minutes of New York's opening bell, the first time it had been below the 10,000 level for seven months. The technology heavy Nasdaq composite index was even harder hit, shedding 5% at one point. In a move which briefly revived memories of October 19, 1987 when the London stock market lost 11% of its value - and a further 12% the following day - the FTSE 100 share index mirrored Wall Street's headlong plunge, rapidly losing almost 200 points at one stage to stand only a fraction above 6,000 points. European markets took a hammering too, with hi-techs especially in the firing line. But as the markets plunged to some of the worst levels seen this year bargain hunters moved in and brought a measure of recovery to hard pressed markets. The Dow cuts its loses to less than 200 points, Nasdaq's recovery saw it back into positive territory and London trimmed its loss to less than a third of the original slump. \"It is still not looking terribly good. Even though we have seen some recovery I don't think it necessarily implies we have reached the bottom,\" said Stephen King, chief economist at HSBC in London. Inflationary pressures have already raised the cost of borrowing in the US and are expected to hit discretionary spending on items such as computers, prompting a sell-off of computer shares. Several of the world's largest technology companies have already warned of weaker revenues going forward and yesterday's news from IBM took 20% off its shares yesterday morning. Ian Shepherdson, economist at High Frequency Economics, said investors would not forgive signs of weakness in the current climate. \"We are in a bear market. Any piece of bad news results in a stock being hammered, while any good news is ignored.\" All but the most defensive food and drug companies were hit by concerns over rising inflation. The consumer price index released by the government yesterday showed that prices for goods such as clothes and tobacco had risen at their fastest pace for six months. The headline CPI rate, which included the rising price of oil, rose 0.5%, after dropping 0.1% in August. Clothing prices showed the biggest increase in 10 years, while housing, health care and tobacco all increased. Investors, which have pushed the Dow and Nasdaq to record highs, this year, now fear that they have been too optimistic about future profits. In the current climate, few analysts would predict whether shares were close to bottoming out yesterday in spite of a 40% fall in the Nasdaq and a 16% decline in the Dow. Mr Shepherdson said he felt technology shares which had been seriously overvalued, were now back in line with the market. Intel, which sparked this latest round of selling with a profits warning last month, is trading at about 34 times forecast 2000 earnings, he said, in line with the average for the S&amp;P 500 group of shares.",

Managerial mind games are nothing new but Ferguson had been put out by PSV claims that his decision to field a weakened team in the first match smacked of conceit. </p> <p>He remarked that this was strange coming from the Dutch. \"I think they have an arrogance which has been well documented,\" he said. \"But to level it at a team like Manchester United when no one else has ever done that - well, maybe some people have - isn't relevant to the facts of the case. </p> <p>\"Dutch teams don't play Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday every week.

Thus Sir Alex Ferguson will confront Eric Gerets's side with his strongest available team, a sharp contrast to his approach in Eindhoven when David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Teddy Sheringham and Andrew Cole started on the bench because the United manager wanted to keep them fresh for the Premiership game at Arsenal the following Sunday. In the event United lost both matches but Ferguson is confident normal business will be resumed tonight. \"The players know it's an important game in that we took a chance in Holland and it didn't work,\" he said yesterday. \"But winning the home games is always the key issue in these group situations.\" So with Beckham fit after a knee problem, Gary Neville recovered from a toe injury, Cole better after a damaged ankle and Giggs, only a substitute at Leicester on Saturday, and Paul Scholes refreshed after a weekend's rest, United will look for an emphatic win . Just in case Old Trafford needs rousing for the occasion, Ferguson yesterday accused the opposition of arrogance and a tendency to dive. Managerial mind games are nothing new but Ferguson had been put out by PSV claims that his decision to field a weakened team in the first match smacked of conceit. He remarked that this was strange coming from the Dutch. \"I think they have an arrogance which has been well documented,\" he said. \"But to level it at a team like Manchester United when no one else has ever done that - well, maybe some people have - isn't relevant to the facts of the case. \"Dutch teams don't play Saturday, Wednesday, Saturday every week. People who make comments like that don't understand the mechanics of our game. We didn't underestimate PSV. We knew we were going to get a hard game but I also felt I knew we could recover from that game by winning our two home matches.\" Manchester United (probable): Barthez; Irwin, G Neville, Johnsen, Silvestre; Beckham, Keane, Scholes, Giggs; Cole, Sheringham. PSV Eindhoven (probable): Waterreus; Heintze, Hofland, Nikiforov, Van der Weerden; Ramzi, Van Bommel, Vogel, Van der Doelen; Bruggink, Kezman. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

They will again call on the government to restore the link between the pension and average earnings. The trouble is, the campaign is now in its 20th year - with no sign of victory. </p> <p>How do such campaigners keep going? Should they soldier on with idealistic aims or trim their sails and focus on more achievable goals? </p> <p>At the Campaign Against Arms Trade, there is a continuing debate about whether to set practical or absolute aims. But co-ordinator Rachel Harford believes pragmatic steps can be taken to achieve what may be seen as an idealistic goal. A first step could be to increase regulation, leading to reduction and finally abolition of arms trading. Harford says: \"I feel offended by accusations of not living in the real world and that banning arms trading is a utopia. Monitoring the daily activities of the arms trade, I would argue I'm very rooted in the real world.\" </p> <p>Sarah Burton, campaigns director at Greenpeace, insists on sticking to ideals. She says: \"It may take 20 years, but keep at it like a dog with a bone.\" </p> <p>One of the environmental group's goals is to phase out fossil fuel. \"Three to four years ago, people said this was idealistic. But now environment secretary John Prescott and the president of Ford are talking about it. Our timescales may be different, but at least it is on the agenda.\" </p> <p>When something isn't even on the agenda, however, it may be difficult to stay motivated. The campaign to restore the link between pensions and average salary is led by the National Pensioners' Convention. Its organiser, Gary Kitchen says: \"One of the most vital tasks must be sustaining the will among grassroots activists.\" </p> <p>Each year the organisation holds a \"pensioner parliament\" that attracts 2,500 older people. Kitchen believes it is also important to hold local events throughout the year, as long as they are orchestrated to attract media attention and not just held for their own sake. \"Even when there is no clear impact on policy, campaigners may receive a fillip through seeing that their efforts are having an impact on public opinion or the media.\" </p> <p>The plight of pensioners has received unprecedented media attention in the past few months and will probably continue to do so in the run-up to the election. But the government seems determined not to restore the link. Kitchen says pensioners are still not deterred. \"The government's refusal to restore the link has served overall to strengthen the pensioner movement. We believe we are fighting for justice not some pragmatic goal. We know that justice is not usually won lightly, so the fact that success may take time is only to be expected.\" </p> <p>Of course, cynics may say that taking time could also be self-serving for those employed by a campaign. There is likely to be more job security in aiming for utopia rather than choosing a pragmatic, achievable goal. So what does happen when a goal is achieved? </p> <p>When the Ottawa Convention was signed in 1998, banning anti-personnel mines in 107 countries, the campaign to ban landmines could have shut up shop. Instead it changed its name and focus. The director of the newly named Landmine Action, Richard Lloyd, says: \"It was a big problem because everyone thought the campaign was over, but there are still a lot of things to do such as clearing mines and helping victims.\" </p> <p>It took 12 months for the campaign to shift its emphasis and refocus the organisation. \"Instead of asking supporters to write to their MP, we are now focusing on fundraising to help victims,\" says Lloyd. \"We had to talk to grant-making trusts and persuade them to still fund us,\" he adds. Fortunately, the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund continued to support the new organisation to the tune of \u00a390,000 a year. Landmine Action is also benefiting from three years' funding from the national lottery. Lloyd says: \"This core support is essential in a period of transition, it gives us the space and ability to move into a second phase.\" </p> <p>Lloyd thinks it is a mistake for campaigns to have too narrow a focus. He maintains that the original campaign always had a practical focus, so it is justified in continuing its work dealing with the aftermath of landmines. He advises that goals should be realistic and adds: \"I would love to see the day when we make ourselves redundant.\" </p> <p>That is exactly what staff at Jubilee 2000 will experience at the end of this year. The organisation's campaign has not achieved its goal - the cancellation of unpayable debt owed by the world's poorest countries by the year 2000. But spokesperson Nick Buxton says: \"Part of the strength of the campaign was a strong focus and a deadline. People felt they could get involved. Even though it may still be a long way off, cancellation of debt is on the agenda and the principle is accepted by all sides.\" </p> <p>The campaign has been very successful in galvanising people to demonstrate at G8 summits, forming human chains and attracting media attention. But its name is a double-edged sword, says Adrian Lovett, deputy director. \"The name Jubilee and the ambition to achieve change for the new millennium resonated with people, but obviously it has an inherent lifespan.\" </p> <p>Lovett argues that there is a strong case for trying to achieve aims in a limited space of time. He also thinks that campaigns should be rational, rather than emotional, and that organisations should shift their focus to concentrate on the economic reasons for change, rather than \"helping poor people\" arguments. He concludes: \"You have to find a way of encompassing realism and idealism to succeed.\"</p>",

Many of the flats on local estates are small, exposing residents to overcrowding and noise. In addition, Islington's need for psychiatric services is almost double the London average and many of its wards register third highest in the UK index of deprivation. </p> <p>The idea was to take a holistic approach to improving the local community's mental and physical health, creating a \"healthy\" building and organic gardens. </p> <p>Designed by an architecture student at what is now North London University, the energy efficient ecology centre incorporates solar water heating panels and recycled paper wall insulation. As well as maintaining the gardens, the charity also operates a neighbourhood scheme, to compost green waste, and has worked with schools and under-fives playgroups on nature gardens and recycling initiatives. Sunnyside estimates that 4,000 people benefit from these activities each year. </p> <p>The charity provides volunteering opportunities for the neighbourhood's residents, day centres and psychiatric hospitals. Activities include gardening, carpentry and environmental art. Much of the work is physically exerting, which project co-ordinator Rosemary Jones believes has positive benefits on mental health, enabling people to regain self-esteem, reduce dependency on statutory services and move on to further education or employment. \"The association ensures people are able to re-centre themselves because of' social support or through attention-focusing practical work, which has the additional benefit of taking the edge off any shyness or lack of confidence.\" </p> <p>In an equal opportunities framework, all those working or visiting are called \"volunteers\", which avoids any sort of hierarchy. Jones says the aim is a welcoming environment, where people feel a sense of community. \"We're not there to do good to people; we're there to be normal.\" </p> <p>About half of the centre's 58 volunteers have, or are recovering from, mental health problems. One, a former architect who had a breakdown 18 months ago, says working at Sunnyside has been extremely therapeutic: \"It's a very friendly and inclusive place, and it's very grounding to work with the soil and as part of a team.\" She is now studying horticulture at college as a result of her volunteer work. </p> <p>While Sunnyside claims it is a prototype for what the government now calls healthy living centres, the charity has yet to attract national lottery funding earmarked for such initiatives. However, a combination of core funding from Islington council and grants from a range of trusts and foundations supports four part-time staff, including a social worker engaged in mental health development work. </p> <p>In addition, Sunnyside has been recognised by the government as one of 23 environmental charities showing good practice in neighbourhood regeneration. It regularly receives referrals from the council's social services department and local mental health charities. </p> <p>Jones says Sunnyside wants to expand volunteering opportunities and training, while increasing residents' involvement in its ecological work. Another volunteer, currently on the charity's management committee, believes Sunnyside fills a gap in the psychiatric care system. \"If you have mental health problems, your whole social life is brought to an end so you can't interact with people,\" he says. \"Here you work with all sorts and become more confident, compared to day centres where you make no friends.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Sunnyside Community Gardens Association, The Ecology &amp; Horticultural Therapy Centre, Hazellville Road, London N19 3LX (020-7272 3522)</p>",

One, a former architect who had a breakdown 18 months ago, says working at Sunnyside has been extremely therapeutic: \"It's a very friendly and inclusive place, and it's very grounding to work with the soil and as part of a team.\" She is now studying horticulture at college as a result of her volunteer work. While Sunnyside claims it is a prototype for what the government now calls healthy living centres, the charity has yet to attract national lottery funding earmarked for such initiatives. However, a combination of core funding from Islington council and grants from a range of trusts and foundations supports four part-time staff, including a social worker engaged in mental health development work. In addition, Sunnyside has been recognised by the government as one of 23 environmental charities showing good practice in neighbourhood regeneration. It regularly receives referrals from the council's social services department and local mental health charities. Jones says Sunnyside wants to expand volunteering opportunities and training, while increasing residents' involvement in its ecological work. Another volunteer, currently on the charity's management committee, believes Sunnyside fills a gap in the psychiatric care system. \"If you have mental health problems, your whole social life is brought to an end so you can't interact with people,\" he says. \"Here you work with all sorts and become more confident, compared to day centres where you make no friends.\" \u0095 Sunnyside Community Gardens Association, The Ecology &amp; Horticultural Therapy Centre, Hazellville Road, London N19 3LX (020-7272 3522)",

With an annual budget of \u00a31bn, 30,000 employees, and European politicians knocking on his door, the man who runs England's most populous county likes to think that his administration is a template for progressive Conservatism. </p> <p>After assuming the leadership of Kent county council three years ago, from a loose Lab-Lib alliance, Bruce-Lockhart cut \u00a327m from the budget, reduced the number of chief officers from 13 to six and created 60 \"business units\" covering all services throughout the organisation, which serves more than 1.3m people. </p> <p>But this was no slash and burn administration at County Hall, Maidstone, dedicated to minimalist government, with everything hived off bar a few essential services. On the contrary, this new Toryism combined firm financial management with an equally strong economic, moral and social agenda - and there are plenty of rough edges around the garden of England - to pull the disadvantaged into the mainstream of society. </p> <p>Kent's glossy five-year plan of action set targets for raising the county's income to create more jobs; safeguarding the environment by cutting greenhouse gases; increasing school funding - while retaining grammar schools; protecting \"vulnerable and disaffected young people\"; and improving the level of care for the elderly and vulnerable. </p> <p>In the modern Tory context, Bruce-Lockhart's ideology cannot be easily defined, although his MP, shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe, gives a clue. \"Sandy is an old-style Tory, patrician yes, with a very strong social conscience ... and a great sense of humour.\" But there are equally strong moral undertones: no truck with Clause 28, and a strong commitment to promoting citizenship and Christian values. He believes people have lost their sense of belonging and that the disadvantaged need a hand-up as well as a hand-out. He certainly wouldn't argue with the label \"Christian democrat\". </p> <p>The council leader, who has been president of Widdecombe's Maidstone constituency association for some time, came into politics via an unconventional route. Born into a Scots family living in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, he eventually left school for the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, and went to work in the then Rhodesia. He ran a large farm, for a South African owner, producing maize and raising cattle with 400 African workers to supervise. He speaks fondly of the experience. \"I developed some very strong friendships,\" he says, while railing against the injustices of apartheid and racism. </p> <p>From southern Africa he went briefly to Australia to test the climate for farming, decided it \"wasn't as nice as Africa\", and arrived in Kent in 1968. After 20 years working the land, he decided to enter politics in 1989. \"Without wanting to sound too grand about it, I felt I wanted to make some kind of contribution to society.\" His 300-acre fruit farm, producing apples and pears, employs 15 people full-time. It is now run by a manager. </p> <p>Bruce-Lockart, aged 58, admits to having had, like many, a jaundiced view of local government. \"I was very cynical about it and, much to my surprise, I found an organisation which was well-run by people of great integrity who had a genuine commitment to public service,\" he says. \"That really surprised me and I feel very strongly that these people, with a strong ethic for helping others, deeply committed to their jobs - social workers, occupational therapists, teachers - are under- valued by society.\" </p> <p>But the past year has not been easy. Criticised for taking a firm line over asylum seekers, he has been deeply offended by some charges levelled against him. \"It is a terrible insult for someone like Sandy to be accused of anything resembling racism,\" insists Widdecombe. \"He's an old-style Tory, not at all racist.\" </p> <p>He has pleaded for understanding, arguing that in the winter of 1996-97 there were 50 asylum seekers coming to Kent; last winter there were 10,000. The county, in short, needed bailing out. While the government's relocation strategy has eased the county's problems, Kent is still looking after 2,300 asylum seekers on its patch, plus a further 800 unaccompanied minors, while the county has the responsibility for a further 4,400 dispersed around England. </p> <p>Bruce-Lockhart himself is much travelled these days as well, hopping regularly between Kent, the Nord Pas de Calais region in France, and Belgium - a designated European economic interest group, where five municipalities club together to promote trade, education links and tourism. </p> <p>Largely as a result of the channel tunnel, Kent is more integrated with the rest of the European Union than any other part of Britain. Ashford, closer by Eurostar to Lille than Waterloo, has 325 French businesses registered in the town - some of them escaping a punitive tax regime across the channel. Eighty per cent of Kent schools have links with a sister school in France. </p> <p>Does this, then, make Bruce-Lockhart the ultimate pro-Euro Tory? Certainly not. He sees no contradiction in promoting closer ties with Europe while preserving the nation-state and opposing the single currency. His leader would be proud of him.</p>",

This is a bit of government snooping which asks teachers how we spend our time during the week. In addition to totalling the hours we spend instructing and doing research, we have to include \"breaks taken from academic duties, whether spent at home or away\", and we have to work out not just the time we spend at conferences but our travel time. I included the fact that I spend 13.7% of each week day-dreaming, 9.8% of which is in my office, 3.2% in my favourite armchair. The government may allow me the armchair. </p> <p>Teachers aren't alone the victims of Big Brother. The bureaucratic nightmare has weighed down the health services, social work, transport, and local government - and no one is getting rich in these jobs. In my own bailiwick, senior scholars in Britain spend about twice the time on administration than they do in America, for about half the pay. The RTE joins other \"exercises\" like the RAE (\"research assessment\") and TQAE (\"teaching quality assessment\"). I don't know who reads this stuff; I do know that for us it is a demoralising rather than an invigorating exercise. </p> <p> The assumption in the past was that people went into public service because of the intrinsic value of the work. But that is no longer realistic. Low pay, coupled with lots of bureaucracy, sends a big warning to young people: do something else! The health services are losing experienced doctors to the private sector; teachers in primary schools harassed by Ofsted are quitting; scholars are leaving the country. I've spent the last week trying to prise out of various government agencies some facts about just how gloomy this gloomy picture is. For some strange reason, among all the statistics our masters gather, I could find no one in authority who keeps records on the brain drain. </p> <p>As a former American academic, what I have observed is a change among people leaving Britain for North America. Fifteen years ago, when British universities began to suffer, the people crossing the Atlantic tended to be stars with international reputations, such as the philosophers Bernard Williams and Richard Wollheim. Today the academic expatriates seem younger, in their early 40s. This is just the age when a scholar or researcher is coming into his or her own, and the time when pay differentials between Britain and America tend to widen. </p> <p>New York University, where I taught, has vigorously recruited some of these talented younger people in the humanities and social sciences. They aren't dewy-eyed immigrants kneeling in prayer as the planes land in America. They have given up family and friends, and their children will go to foreign schools. Nor are they simply coming for the money. The ones I know - and used to recruit - have come for the sake of their work. </p> <p>It's easy to blame Thatcherism for this sorry state of affairs, given the hatred she and her cronies nursed against the intelligentsia and the contempt her crew showed public service in general. But blaming the Tories is too easy. Though the present government has begun to address the financial distress of the public sector, it has yet to grapple with the demoralising, soul- deadening bureaucracy which makes talented people think about doing something else or going elsewhere. </p> <p>The problem is simply that the government does not trust the public sector to regulate itself, at least at the professional level. Of course there were, and are, and will be, abuses in the public sector - just as in business. I imagine the present government is still in thrall to the terrible time in the 80s when local Labour councils ceased to serve the public interest well, or serve it at all. But to treat doctors, social workers or teachers like local councillors is a grave error. </p> <p>A public service works well when professionals in it get respect for their work; under these conditions they will hold each other to account. That's how the health services used to operate, and it made medical care in Britain the envy of other countries. The present system is an institutionalised form of contempt: it supposes that, left to ourselves, we won't keep our own houses in order. </p> <p>I have, therefore, a simple policy proposal: trust us - the most radical reform this government could undertake. Put everyone employed administering the RTE, the RAE and the TQAE to work monitoring Railtrack instead; let us govern ourselves. If the government did just this, perhaps those British academics who have been lured abroad would begin buying plane-tickets home. </p> <p> Richard Sennett, author of 'The corrosion of character' (Norton \u00a38.95) and sociology professor at LSE, will be writing a regular column.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Railtrack, Gerald Corbett, tendered his resignation today, as the organisation admitted that the condition of the track in the area of yesterday's Hatfield train derailment was \"not good\". With investigations into the crash focusing on the possibility that a broken rail caused the Great North Eastern Railways service to derail, the Railtrack board will meet at 6pm today to decide whether to accept Mr Corbett's resignation. Railtrack, the rail infrastructure company that is responsible for maintaining tracks, said the section of the line where the accident occurred had been reassessed for re-railing in January and that work had started in May. The balance of the work was due to have been completed in November and the crash section of track had been treated for grinding in early September to prevent cracks, Railtrack said. As GNER resumed a full service on the line where four people died yesterday, Railtrack said that it was \"investigating the possibility of a broken rail being a factor in the tragedy\". At the scene of the crash, a Railtrack director said that a broken rail had been found, but it was not yet known if it was smashed before the accident or during it. Earlier, Mr Corbett said: \"I, personally, am distraught that another tragedy has occurred on our railways. \"The families of the bereaved are foremost in my mind. As a matter of course, as chief executive of Railtrack, I have, of course, tendered my resignation to the board.\" However, Pam Warren, the founder of the Paddington Survivors Group, said: \"We urge Railtrack not to accept Gerald Corbett's resignation.\" Speaking at a news conference at the Madejski stadium in Reading, Berks, Mrs Warren, who was badly burned in last year's rail disaster, said: \"I have today spoken to Gerald Corbett and his wife. He is genuinely upset and affected with what has happened. \"The way forward now is constructive dialogue. We are beginning to have a working relationship with Railtrack.\" Railtrack also today imposed a speed restriction on bends on high-speed lines. This will require drivers to knock a third off their permitted speed in such areas and will lead to inevitable delays for passengers. Seven people were today still in hospital after Tuesday's 12.10pm GNER London to Leeds high-speed train derailed in Hertfordshire. The four men who died in the crash have yet to be named, although the identities of two of those who died in the crash were due to be released later tonight by police. All were in the buffet car of the train which had its roof torn off after colliding with a trackside pylon. Although they were not named, those still in hospital are six women and one man. The women were identified as a 61-year-old from Salisbury in Wiltshire, a 30-year-old from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, a 66-year-old from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, a 40-year-old from Nottingham, a 38-year-old from London and a 40-year old from Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The man, aged 41, comes from south-east London, said police. Both Railtrack and GNER agreed today that the crash will lead to renewed anxiety among passengers. Railtrack London and North East Region director Nicholas Pollard said: \"The investigations will continue urgently throughout today.\" He said he was aware that Railtrack could come under heavy fire if the crash was found to be caused by a fault with a rail. \"I am sure people will take that line and I understand that obviously a tragedy of this nature shakes confidence right across the industry in the UK as a whole.\" GNER chief executive Christopher Garnett said that railways were still \"incredibly safe although I do accept that what happened yesterday has shaken people's confidence\". Mr Garnett added that he did not think that the number of serious accidents in recent years was anything to do with rail privatisation. He added: \"There is a perception that rail travel is unsafe, but when you look at the statistics, it is an incredibly safe way of travel.\" But Vernon Hince, of the biggest rail union the RMT, said there had been widespread concern that the privatised rail companies were not observing safety procedures. George Muir, director general of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said that he was certain that \"corners were not cut\". As the search for clues continued, transport minister Lord Macdonald said that he was looking for answers \"in hours and days rather than weeks\". The routes that are most likely to be affected by the Railtrack speed restrictions are the London to Scotland East Coast main line on which the accident happened, the West Coast main line, which also runs from London to Scotland and the Great Western line from London to Bristol and Cardiff. The West Coast line, in particular, has a number of bends. This has prompted Virgin Trains, run by Sir Richard Branson, to invest in high-speed tilting trains that can go faster around curves. They are due to be introduced on the line in 2002 and will considerably reduce journey times from London to the Midlands, north west of England and Scotland. After bringing down the annual number of broken rails in the network, Railtrack had to report a sharp rise in incidents in 1998-99. Although the figure was slightly down in 1999-2000, Rail Regulator Tom Winsor has told Railtrack of his unhappiness with its record on broken rails. Publishing the latest statistics for broken rail, the Health and Safety Executive said that the number was \"still significantly higher than in the mid-1990s\". Another problem, according to provisional HSE figures, is buckles in track. The number of these, which had fallen to 21 in 1998-99, more than trebled to 64 in 1999-2000. Yesterday's accident occurred on a stretch of track that is continuously welded, which should greatly reduce the chances of a rail cracking. But rail experts agree that defects can appear even in welded areas. In its most recent annual report, Railtrack said that the drop in the number of broken rails last year was not enough, but added that track quality was now better than at any time since the mid-1990s. The company has also said that the growth of traffic on the network, particularly heavy freight, has had a major impact on track deterioration. The company has been ensuring that track renewals are targeted at locations where they will have the most effect. Railtrack has also spoken of introducing the UIC60 rail, which is the standard rail used in the rest of Europe. It is stronger than the traditional rail that is used in Britain and needs less maintenance. The company plans to replace an extra 350 miles of rail over the next five years. A total of 68,000 tonnes of new rail has been ordered for this year - the highest amount since 1988. In 1995-96, there were 776 broken rails and 133 track buckles on the network. The following year, broken rails dropped to 739, but provisional figures for 1999-2000 saw the figure climb to 949 from a high of 988 in the previous 12 months. Track buckles slid to a low of 21 in 1998-99, but by last year, the provisional figures revealed 64 incidents. In the immediate aftermath of the crash, several possible reasons for the crash were considered, including terrorism, which has since been discounted. A broken wheel was also thought a possible cause, but GNER said today that, as they were convinced that this was not the case, they would be running a service on the route today. Vandalism is another possibility that has not been ruled out, but that seems unlikely, as it would be expected that the front of the train would have been derailed before the middle carriages. The assistant chief constable of the British Transport Police, Paul Nicholas, said that a criminal investigation, probing the possibility of vandalism, was underway. This needs to be concluded before the police give control of the scene over for the technical investigation _ which is expected to happen no earlier than the end of this week. Mr Nicholas said: \"20% of that [the investigation] has been conducted and there is no evidence of vandalism so far.\" The overturned carriages had been partially lifted this afternoon with the use of air bags and no more casualties had been found, he said. The search would continue tomorrow and the carriages would probably not be removed from the line until Friday. Among the Railtrack board members who will tonight decide the fate of Mr Gerald Corbett's will be Jennifer Page, the sacked chief executive of the Millennium Dome. Ms Page, who earns \u00a326,000 in her role as a part-time board member of Railtrack, will be one of 12 directors at the meeting, which will start after 6pm at Railtrack's head office by Euston station in London.

In an interview with the Guardian yesterday, Mr Shiller said that US shares were still trading at historically high valuations in spite of a dramatic sell-off in the past six weeks. He shrugged off the impact of individual corporate results on the overall trend. \"Instead of a bubble bursting, the market is more like a ball with a leak in it. It is going down but imperceptibly.\" When Mr Shiller published his book Irrational Exuberance earlier this year, the Dow Jones and Nasdaq stock indexes were close to all-time highs.

Predictably, Israelis now want Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to prove that he means peace, while Arab opinion wants exactly the same of Israel. The Jordan Times gives prominence to two pictures: smiling leaders at the Sharm el-Sheik summit, and grieving women at the funeral of 13-year-old Muayyad Osama Jawarish in Bethlehem. The paper reports King Abdullah's warning that the success of the ceasefire depends entirely upon Israel's prompt implementation of its part of the deal. A gloomy leading article also notes that peace hopes depend on what happens on the streets. \"Palestinian president Yasser Arafat and Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, whose mutual trust has plunged to an all-time low, will have to work hard to sell the truce to their furious populations and to ensure it stands. \"They will have to calculate their own political and diplomatic risks and see how best they could build confidence and re-engage for the benefit of the whole region. \"Clinton, who is counting his final days in the White House, has to work equally hard to ensure full implementation of the latest agreement to fulfil his promise of an honest peace broker - even if most Arabs have given up on that.\" The Khaleej Times, in the United Arab Emirates, rather callously observes that the Sharm el-Sheik agreement has calmed world oil markets. The editorial goes on to note the lurch to the right of Israeli public opinion, and the enormous task facing Palestinian president Yasser Arafat to convince his people of the need to resume peace negotiations. \"Passions are running high among the rank and file of his own organisation, Fatah, who believe that the long-winded peace process has run its course and that it is time to renew the intifada. \"It will take more than mere words from Arafat to put back their faith in negotiation.\" The Palestinian Ministry of Information daily summary of headlines from the local Arabic papers is full of anger and bloodshed, with three more deaths recorded and a great deal of invective against Jewish settlers in the occupied territories. The Arab Media Internet Network carries a reminder that it is not just those in the front line who are being harmed. It features an appeal by the Union of Palestinian medical relief committees for international intervention. The appeal points out that many communities are running short of food and medicine, and is fiercely critical of the Israeli \"closures\" - the sealing off of Arab areas.

The Jerusalem Post carries news of continuing violence, and an extraordinary report that two men who were in the mob which lynched two Israeli soldiers in Ramallah last week, may have been abducted and summarily executed by Israeli secret service agents.

Its report points out the dangers to the divers who are to undertake the task and questions whether it is necessary to expose the families of the 118 dead men once again to such extreme levels of stress, unavoidable during a recovery operation which is due at best to retrieve just a small fraction of the bodies. Under a headline \"Leave their bodies in peace\", the report concludes: \"According to a naval tradition which has existed ever the beginning of seafaring history, there is no shame in being buried at sea\". <p><b>Middle East</b> <br> The reasons behind Russia's non-attendance at the Sharm El-Sheikh peace summit continue for the second day to be analysed in the Russian press - with the humiliation of the perceived snub to the Kremlin gaining almost as much prominence as the agreement itself. Seeking to explain Russia's absence from such an important international summit, the tabloid <b>Komsomolskaya Pravda</b> argues that Russia - having proved its diplomatic prowess in the resolution of the conflict in Yugoslavia - was giving America a chance to play a key role in negotiations. The report concludes that Russia will have plenty of opportunity in the future to exert its influence in the resolution of Middle Eastern affairs, characterising the agreement reached by Ehud Barak and Yasser Arafat as \"fragile\". </p> <p><b>Pope</b><br> With the spy case against American citizen Edmund Pope due to begin today, the businessman's lawyer tells the <b>Moscow Times</b> that his prospects are bleak. Pope, a retired naval intelligence officer who travelled to Russia to buy marine technology equipment for use in the West, was arrested in Moscow on April 3 and charged with trying to buy top secret documents connected with a high-speed torpedo called the Shkval. If he is found guilty, Pope, 54, faces up to 20 years in prison. The paper quotes Pope as commenting that he has little hope of being released, stating: \"I see two possible outcomes - a better one and a worse one. The worse one would be that we are all thrown in jail, including the laywers. The better one would be that I am imprisoned alone.\" </p> <p><b>Gore-Chernomyrdin scandal continues</b><br> The fall out from George Bush jnr's accusation that former prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin siphoned off IMF funds continues in Russia's papers today. The remarks were made as Bush launched an attack on the Democrats' policy on Russia during last week's televised debate with Al Gore and prompted Chernomyrdin to announce this week that he planned to sue. <b>Izvestiya</b> reports on the latest stage of a scandal, which it believes could extinguish Gore's chances of winning the elections. The paper publishes the text of a letter from Chernomyrdin to Gore, informing him about details of Russian nuclear cooperation with Iran and urging him to keep the details secret from Congress. Explaining the power of these revelations within the context of the American election campaign, the paper comments: \"The Republicans have nosed out an opportunity to attack the Democrats for having apparently led Russia from the bright world of democracy into the leaden and foggy twilight of corruption\". </p> <p><b>Bolshoi Premier</b><br> After weeks of upheaval behind scenes at the Bolshoi, great attention has been paid in the Russian press to preparations for tonight's premier of Tchaikovsky's opera Evgeny Onegin. Rather than displaying a new interpretation of the work, the producer has returned to a 1944 production - recreating costumes and sets from this classic production. Moscow's critics are, however, undecided about the value of this exercise. <b>Komsomolskaya Pravda</b> also reports with some scepticism on the decision to cast the popular classical star, Nikolai Baskov, in the main role as Lensky - commenting that the singer has become so used to performing to huge concert audiences that he can no longer sing well without the aid of a microphone and has clearly been struggling during rehearsals. </p> <p>\"This was evident from the laboured expressions he made, and his agonised articulation of every sound,\" the reporter comments \"You got the impression that Lensky had some kind of tic or another kind of illness to the nervous system.\"</p>",

Explaining the power of these revelations within the context of the American election campaign, the paper comments: \"The Republicans have nosed out an opportunity to attack the Democrats for having apparently led Russia from the bright world of democracy into the leaden and foggy twilight of corruption\". Bolshoi Premier After weeks of upheaval behind scenes at the Bolshoi, great attention has been paid in the Russian press to preparations for tonight's premier of Tchaikovsky's opera Evgeny Onegin. Rather than displaying a new interpretation of the work, the producer has returned to a 1944 production - recreating costumes and sets from this classic production. Moscow's critics are, however, undecided about the value of this exercise. Komsomolskaya Pravda also reports with some scepticism on the decision to cast the popular classical star, Nikolai Baskov, in the main role as Lensky - commenting that the singer has become so used to performing to huge concert audiences that he can no longer sing well without the aid of a microphone and has clearly been struggling during rehearsals. \"This was evident from the laboured expressions he made, and his agonised articulation of every sound,\" the reporter comments \"You got the impression that Lensky had some kind of tic or another kind of illness to the nervous system.\"",

      "byline": "Rachel Hargreaves",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Like any proud parent, Rachel Hargreaves has framed photographs of her baby daughter dotted around her living room. Her favourite is in a large frame, showing the tiny newborn with dark hair and grey eyes, clutching a small white teddy bear. But, unlike other parents, Hargreaves has nothing left but pictures and memories. </p> <p>Chelsea hardly stopped crying in the 15 weeks leading up to her death in April. One day, Hargreaves, who was alone at the time and suffering from post-natal depression, snapped. Unable to calm the baby, she picked her up and shook her. Chelsea died in hospital the following day. </p> <p>Last week, Hargreaves, a trained nursery nurse, was given a three-year probation order by Leeds crown court after pleading guilty to infanticide. Expressing sympathy, the judge acknowledged her remorse. </p> <p>Hargreaves, now 24, became pregnant after a brief relationship with the baby's father. He was not aware of the pregnancy and played no part in Chelsea's short life. Her waters broke five weeks early on December 28 last year and she was taken into Pinderfields hospital, Wakefield. The following day at 9.41pm she gave birth to Chelsea, who had problems breathing. </p> <p>Although Hargreaves had just gained a diploma in childcare studies, she had more experience with toddlers and school-age children than with infants. \"At first, Chelsea was the most perfect baby,\" recalls Hargreaves, \"who never cried unless she wanted feeding. When she was awake, she was perfectly happy and contented and she didn't need to be picked up and held all the time.\" </p> <p>All that changed when Chelsea was five-and-a-half weeks old. \"She started screaming at dinnertime and she wouldn't stop,\" says Hargreaves. \"She wouldn't take her feed and I tried changing her and cuddling her, but she wouldn't stop crying. It was a completely different cry to what I had heard before - it was like she was in pain.\" </p> <p>Hargreaves is smartly dressed in a grey roll-neck jumper and black trousers. Though frank and articulate, she seems nervous about discussing what happened to her baby. She is painfully thin. Despite her freckles and long chestnut hair, she looks older than her 24 years. </p> <p>\"I went and talked to the health visitor and she said it might be colic. So we tried different colic drops, none of which worked. We laid her on her tummy, but that didn't work - and the crying just seemed to get worse and worse. She continued to refuse her feeds and her weight gain started to drop.\" </p> <p>Hargreaves became exhausted and frustrated: the worst feeling was uselessness at not being able to settle her baby. Chelsea cried incessantly. At most, Hargreaves was getting a couple of hours of sleep at night and during the day. </p> <p>Hargreaves attended a baby clinic every week with Chelsea and talked about her concerns. A health visitor suggested the baby might be allergic to cow's milk, so she switched to soya milk. It worked for a few days, but Chelsea soon became irritable again. The health visitor suggested aromatherapy massage and swaddling, which made Chelsea feel secure for a few minutes, but didn't last. </p> <p>Hargreaves is not particularly close to her parents but used to meet her mother once a week in Wakefield. Her parents bought things for Chelsea and her mother knitted for her. \"I am a person who tries to cope - that is the way I have been brought up. It is very difficult to pick up the phone when you are trying to soothe your own baby.\" </p> <p>But Hargreaves was not coping. She was prescribed anti-depressants by her general practitioner. \"I felt I was in a deep hole and couldn't get out. It all felt as if it was never-ending. I remember my health visitor saying there would be an end one day when she gets older, but I couldn't believe it,\" she says. </p> <p>Chelsea was admitted to hospital for observation in March because of her incessant crying. \"By this point I was really down and felt really alone,\" says Hargreaves. \"The hospital staff said they thought her inability to settle was down to my anxiety. When I needed help, they were telling me my illness was causing her crying.\" </p> <p>On April 12, the day she shook Chelsea, she had been to the baby clinic and spoken to her health visitor. The baby had been crying constantly all the day. \"I had hit rock bottom. I asked the health visitor if adoption agencies were listed in the Yellow Pages because I couldn't cope any more. I think she tried to brush it off really.\" </p> <p>They went home and the baby was still crying. They were sat together on the sofa and Hargreaves was holding Chelsea with her knees drawn up, resting the baby on her stomach. \"I just picked her up not knowing what I was going to do,\" she says, her face wet with tears. \"I said to her 'God Chelsea, I don't know what to do to make you happy. Please stop it, I can't do anything.' </p> <p>\"It was just one shake that I remember and it wasn't even very hard or violent. It was more out of frustration than anything.

      "bodyText": "Like any proud parent, Rachel Hargreaves has framed photographs of her baby daughter dotted around her living room. Her favourite is in a large frame, showing the tiny newborn with dark hair and grey eyes, clutching a small white teddy bear. But, unlike other parents, Hargreaves has nothing left but pictures and memories. Chelsea hardly stopped crying in the 15 weeks leading up to her death in April. One day, Hargreaves, who was alone at the time and suffering from post-natal depression, snapped. Unable to calm the baby, she picked her up and shook her. Chelsea died in hospital the following day. Last week, Hargreaves, a trained nursery nurse, was given a three-year probation order by Leeds crown court after pleading guilty to infanticide. Expressing sympathy, the judge acknowledged her remorse. Hargreaves, now 24, became pregnant after a brief relationship with the baby's father. He was not aware of the pregnancy and played no part in Chelsea's short life. Her waters broke five weeks early on December 28 last year and she was taken into Pinderfields hospital, Wakefield. The following day at 9.41pm she gave birth to Chelsea, who had problems breathing. Although Hargreaves had just gained a diploma in childcare studies, she had more experience with toddlers and school-age children than with infants. \"At first, Chelsea was the most perfect baby,\" recalls Hargreaves, \"who never cried unless she wanted feeding. When she was awake, she was perfectly happy and contented and she didn't need to be picked up and held all the time.\" All that changed when Chelsea was five-and-a-half weeks old. \"She started screaming at dinnertime and she wouldn't stop,\" says Hargreaves. \"She wouldn't take her feed and I tried changing her and cuddling her, but she wouldn't stop crying. It was a completely different cry to what I had heard before - it was like she was in pain.\" Hargreaves is smartly dressed in a grey roll-neck jumper and black trousers. Though frank and articulate, she seems nervous about discussing what happened to her baby. She is painfully thin. Despite her freckles and long chestnut hair, she looks older than her 24 years. \"I went and talked to the health visitor and she said it might be colic. So we tried different colic drops, none of which worked. We laid her on her tummy, but that didn't work - and the crying just seemed to get worse and worse. She continued to refuse her feeds and her weight gain started to drop.\" Hargreaves became exhausted and frustrated: the worst feeling was uselessness at not being able to settle her baby. Chelsea cried incessantly. At most, Hargreaves was getting a couple of hours of sleep at night and during the day. Hargreaves attended a baby clinic every week with Chelsea and talked about her concerns. A health visitor suggested the baby might be allergic to cow's milk, so she switched to soya milk. It worked for a few days, but Chelsea soon became irritable again. The health visitor suggested aromatherapy massage and swaddling, which made Chelsea feel secure for a few minutes, but didn't last. Hargreaves is not particularly close to her parents but used to meet her mother once a week in Wakefield. Her parents bought things for Chelsea and her mother knitted for her. \"I am a person who tries to cope - that is the way I have been brought up. It is very difficult to pick up the phone when you are trying to soothe your own baby.\" But Hargreaves was not coping. She was prescribed anti-depressants by her general practitioner. \"I felt I was in a deep hole and couldn't get out. It all felt as if it was never-ending. I remember my health visitor saying there would be an end one day when she gets older, but I couldn't believe it,\" she says. Chelsea was admitted to hospital for observation in March because of her incessant crying. \"By this point I was really down and felt really alone,\" says Hargreaves. \"The hospital staff said they thought her inability to settle was down to my anxiety. When I needed help, they were telling me my illness was causing her crying.\" On April 12, the day she shook Chelsea, she had been to the baby clinic and spoken to her health visitor. The baby had been crying constantly all the day. \"I had hit rock bottom. I asked the health visitor if adoption agencies were listed in the Yellow Pages because I couldn't cope any more. I think she tried to brush it off really.\" They went home and the baby was still crying. They were sat together on the sofa and Hargreaves was holding Chelsea with her knees drawn up, resting the baby on her stomach. \"I just picked her up not knowing what I was going to do,\" she says, her face wet with tears. \"I said to her 'God Chelsea, I don't know what to do to make you happy. Please stop it, I can't do anything.' \"It was just one shake that I remember and it wasn't even very hard or violent. It was more out of frustration than anything. It didn't stop the crying and afterwards I felt really bad about it and immediately gave her a big hug. She seemed to be OK and then I went to change her nappy and laid her on her changing mat and she stopped breathing. \"I picked her up, thinking she must be choking. Her eyes rolled back into her head and she had gone stiff. She was making a choking and gasping noise. I just picked up the phone and called an ambulance. At the time I was panicking because my baby was not breathing. I didn't really link it with me shaking her. I tried to give her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

It's a good place to cry, a public swimming pool. Oddly private - with all that water, chlorine and condensation to explain away the tears, no one looks at you askance. Not even my three-year-old son. Anyway, he's seen me cry before. He knows I'm thinking of Granny. </p> <p>My mother was a championship swimmer in her youth - I still have her medals. A grandson who is a water baby would have made my mother so happy, and if I look up from the pool I swear I can see her sitting there watching us and smiling. </p> <p>But the fact is, she isn't there. As Kit unabashedly tells anyone who asks: \"Granny is with Jesus in heaven.\" When recently he lost his grip on his balloon at Legoland, he watched it floating ever upwards and found some comfort in the thought: \"It's a present for Granny.\" </p> <p>My mother died of cancer at the age of 77. It was just before Kit's second birthday, and I beat myself up with the thought that I should have taken Kit to see her more often to forge a stronger bond between them. Yet even if I had, I'm not sure if it would have imprinted something substantial on his memory. In adult life a two-year relationship with another can be pivotal - books have been written about a week spent with Marilyn Monroe - but the two years at the start of your life register later as if blank. </p> <p>But if they are as nothing to Kit, the time they did spend together was special to my mother. Latterly, she spent quite a lot of each day resting in bed. If we were staying overnight, Kit would wander in to see her as soon as he got up. I would appear much later and find him chuntering away to her. She would be smiling, and for a moment it was hard to believe that she wasn't in tip-top health. </p> <p>It was only on the night she died, as we all sat in the room next door and my sister took out the family photo album, that I realised what my mother must have been thinking on those glorious early mornings. For Kit looks like a carbon copy of me at the same age and I had been her baby, the afterthought who came along a decade later than after my siblings, the child into whom she channelled all her frustrated energy as multiple sclerosis slowly but inevitably reduced her world before cancer shut it down. </p> <p>How, now, do I explain all of that to Kit? How do I help him to know it as his own? Yes, he knows about heaven and dutifully lights a candle for Granny when we go to Mass, but he doesn't know about death. He was, we thought, too young to attend her funeral - although a psychotherapist friend now tells me that was a mistake; that children, however small, have to be confronted with the evidence of loss before they can comprehend it. (I'm not convinced.) </p> <p>Kit knows that Granny couldn't walk and that she used a wheelchair, but he knows nothing of pain and disability. And he knows that he loves his own mummy to distraction, but struggles with the idea that his daddy was ever a little boy, let alone one who loved his mummy with a similar passion. So how do I explain about Granny? Should I even try? </p> <p>The second question is easier. Being a child of parents who were both in their forties when I was born, I never knew my own grandparents. Both my grandfathers died years before I was born and my grandmothers, who died when I was still at primary school, are dim memories. I could write down most of what I know about them on the back of a raffle ticket. </p> <p>I don't want it to be that way with Kit. I want him to have a sense of his place in the cycle of generations, so that when I am no longer here he does not feel as alone as I do now. I know, of course, that Kit will know his Granny through me. If I am what she made me, then he will benefit - or not - from that. The trouble is, that feels like a poor substitute. And so I struggle to make her someone we talk about often and happily, a real, flesh-and-blood person, someone who is still a part of our family, albeit from her lofty perch on high. </p> <p>So, in the swimming pool, I remind him of how good she was at swimming and later I show him pictures of her in her bathing costume on some windswept English beach in the middle of March. And as I do so, I experience this almost unbearable physical ache that makes me want to cry out in pain. Perhaps that was why my own parents were so silent for so long about my grandparents. They couldn't bear to talk about them. </p> <p>Yet there is the problem. My desire to plant in my son a rounded memory of his Granny can often be at odds with my own still raw grief. The result for Kit is, I hate to admit, that he now associates his Granny with sadness - sadness that she couldn't walk, sadness that she had to stop swimming, sadness that she has gone to live with Jesus, sadness that she makes Daddy so sad. </p> <p>I recently decided to take Kit to see his Granny. Visiting is a concept he understands in terms of everyone else in his life, so why not her? We went to her grave. I told him it was a special place where people could go to be close to Granny. I made no mention of corpses and burial or anything like that. When we got there I asked him as casually as I could what he remembered about her, which was very little, so then we sat on the grass and I told him some stories about her. And I promise I didn't cry, but at the end, quite unprompted, he got up, walked over and solemnly hugged her tombstone as if he were hugging her.</p>",

It's a good place to cry, a public swimming pool. Oddly private - with all that water, chlorine and condensation to explain away the tears, no one looks at you askance. Not even my three-year-old son. Anyway, he's seen me cry before. He knows I'm thinking of Granny. My mother was a championship swimmer in her youth - I still have her medals. A grandson who is a water baby would have made my mother so happy, and if I look up from the pool I swear I can see her sitting there watching us and smiling. But the fact is, she isn't there. As Kit unabashedly tells anyone who asks: \"Granny is with Jesus in heaven.\" When recently he lost his grip on his balloon at Legoland, he watched it floating ever upwards and found some comfort in the thought: \"It's a present for Granny.\" My mother died of cancer at the age of 77. It was just before Kit's second birthday, and I beat myself up with the thought that I should have taken Kit to see her more often to forge a stronger bond between them. Yet even if I had, I'm not sure if it would have imprinted something substantial on his memory.

      "body": "<b>Southall, Clapham, Ladbroke Grove and now Hatfield. Why are there so many train accidents?</b> <br> Yesterday's derailment near Hatfield, Hertforshire, was the latest in a series of fatal rail accidents stretching back over 12 years. Unlike the previous three, however, the London to Leeds intercity did not collide with another train but simply came off the rails. Until the investigation is complete we will not know why. <p><b>Who carries out the investigation?</b><br> The government's health and safety executive will examine the wreckage with the railways inspectorate and around 60 to 70 officers from the British Transport Police. The investigators are all specialists and this time last year many would have been working at Ladbroke Grove. They will be looking for anything out of the ordinary that would cause the intercity to derail. Lord Macdonald, the transport minister, has said he wants answers quickly.</p> <p><b>What are the likely causes?</b><br> Vandalism and terrorism have been ruled out so the investigators will be looking for faults on the track or train. Preliminary investigations have revealed that a rail was smashed and, if it was damaged before the accident, that would have been enough to derail the train. But until forensic tests are complete we will not know when the track was smashed. If it was damaged during the accident, the investigators will then look for faults on the rolling stock's wheels and axles. </p> <p><b>Are the railways safe?</b><br> Thirty-five people died at Clapham, seven at Southall and 31 at Ladbroke Grove. Four died at Hatfield and, in total, 94 people have died on the railways since 1988 in accidents including those already mentioned and others at places such as Purley, Glasgow and Stafford. </p> <p><b>What do the train operators say?</b><br> Christopher Garnett, the GNER chief executive, says the railways are safe: \"There is a perception that rail travel is unsafe, but when you look at the statistics it is an incredibly safe way of travel,\" he said today. Train travel may be statistically safer than making a journey by car but that does not mean it is safe, or as safe as it could be. The Southall inquiry recommended automatic train protection (ATP) for the rail network to stops trains passing red signals at danger and crashing into each other. The Ladbroke Grove inquiry is not complete but many believe that accident, which happened on the same stretch of track, would have been avoided if ATP had been installed, as it is in much of the European Union.</p> <p><b>Will it be installed?</b><br> Successive governments and the rail industry have dragged their heels for so long that the ATP equipment they were expected to fit a decade ago is now out of date. Railtrack is now pressing ahead with a project to install the non-computerised, and inferior, train protection warning system (TPWS) but, on the other hand, plans to fit the superior European train control system (ETCS) on the west coast line between London, the Midlands and Glasgow by 2005. However, with no firm plans beyond that date it is likely to be at least a decade before Britain has a decent high speed rail network with automatic safety systems. <b>Is it fair to say the privatised rail companies are more interested in profit than safety?</b><br> The rail companies say that the number of accidents in recent years has nothing to do with privatisation. Some disagree: Vernon Hince, of the RMT rail union, said today that there is widespread concern that the privatised operators are not observing safety procedures. Whatever the answer, the last government cut the money given to British Rail as it prepared it for privatisation (to make it attractive for investors, for which read cheap.) If the recent accidents are due to a lack of investment, it goes back a lot further than the four years that Railtrack and the private operators have been in control.</p> <p><b>Is the network in a bad state?</b><br> There were 949 broken rails last year, up from 656 in 1995. In August the rail regulator, Tom Winsor, said he was unhappy with Railtrack's failure to make \"an appreciable reduction\" in the number of broken rails. Railtrack makes \u00a31.3m profit a day looking after the 20,000 miles of lines, signals and stations that make up its network. <b>What steps is Railtrack taking?</b><br> The speed limits of trains across the country have been cut until the cause of yesterday's disaster is clear. This does not mean that train was going too fast - it is a precaution to take the stress of what may be faulty rails or rolling stock. A train that normally travels at 100 mph will now be restricted to 65 mph.</p> <p><b>What if it is Railtrack's fault?</b><br> Gerald Corbett, the company's chief executive, has tendered his resignation and Railtrack's board meets tonight to decide whether to accept it. He bore the brunt of much of the criticism in the wake of the Paddington disaster and today expressed regret for Hatfield. \"I, personally, am distraught that another tragedy has occurred on our railways,\" he said. If Railtrack were found responsible it would have enormous repercussions for the company and the future of rail travel in the UK. </p> <p><b>Could the rail companies be charged with corporate manslaughter?</b><br> The current law states that charges of corporate manslaughter can be brought against named individuals in companies only if the prosecution can prove they have \"controlling\" responsibility. That has led to executives escaping charges in a string of high-profile disasters ranging from the King's Cross tube station fire that killed 31 people in 1987 to last year's Paddington rail crash. New proposals are being introduced to make it easier to prosecute company bosses but they will come too late for Hatfield. </p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/hatfieldtraincrash/\">Special report: The Hatfield train crash</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.railtrack.co.uk/search/BuildResults.cfm?u=http://www.railtrack.co.uk/shareholder/agm99/directors/2.html\">Gerald Corbett's CV</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/traincrash/\">Special report: The Paddington disaster<br> </a><a href=\"http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/\" \"target=\"_NEW\">Office of the Rail Regulator</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.warwick.ac.uk/services/publicity/WD/corbett.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Gerald Corbett speech defending privatisation</a> <a href=\"http://www.railtrack.co.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">Railtrack plc</a></p>",

However, with no firm plans beyond that date it is likely to be at least a decade before Britain has a decent high speed rail network with automatic safety systems. Is it fair to say the privatised rail companies are more interested in profit than safety? The rail companies say that the number of accidents in recent years has nothing to do with privatisation. Some disagree: Vernon Hince, of the RMT rail union, said today that there is widespread concern that the privatised operators are not observing safety procedures. Whatever the answer, the last government cut the money given to British Rail as it prepared it for privatisation (to make it attractive for investors, for which read cheap.) If the recent accidents are due to a lack of investment, it goes back a lot further than the four years that Railtrack and the private operators have been in control. Is the network in a bad state? There were 949 broken rails last year, up from 656 in 1995. In August the rail regulator, Tom Winsor, said he was unhappy with Railtrack's failure to make \"an appreciable reduction\" in the number of broken rails. Railtrack makes \u00a31.3m profit a day looking after the 20,000 miles of lines, signals and stations that make up its network. What steps is Railtrack taking? The speed limits of trains across the country have been cut until the cause of yesterday's disaster is clear. This does not mean that train was going too fast - it is a precaution to take the stress of what may be faulty rails or rolling stock. A train that normally travels at 100 mph will now be restricted to 65 mph. What if it is Railtrack's fault? Gerald Corbett, the company's chief executive, has tendered his resignation and Railtrack's board meets tonight to decide whether to accept it. He bore the brunt of much of the criticism in the wake of the Paddington disaster and today expressed regret for Hatfield. \"I, personally, am distraught that another tragedy has occurred on our railways,\" he said. If Railtrack were found responsible it would have enormous repercussions for the company and the future of rail travel in the UK. Could the rail companies be charged with corporate manslaughter? The current law states that charges of corporate manslaughter can be brought against named individuals in companies only if the prosecution can prove they have \"controlling\" responsibility. That has led to executives escaping charges in a string of high-profile disasters ranging from the King's Cross tube station fire that killed 31 people in 1987 to last year's Paddington rail crash. New proposals are being introduced to make it easier to prosecute company bosses but they will come too late for Hatfield.

The 12th-century building was filled to capacity by 1,300 of Mr Dewar's friends, colleagues and family, who gathered together to pay their final respects to the man described as the father of the nation. The Rev Douglas Alexander, who conducted the service, was a longstanding friend of Mr Dewar and the father of Scottish communities minister Wendy Alexander, the first minister's protege, and Paisley South MP Douglas Alexander. He paid tribute to Mr Dewar and spoke of his 50-year friendship with the first minister that began during their days at Glasgow University. Another friend, the chancellor Gordon Brown, raised muted laughter with an anecdote from his friend's life. \"Though he has gone from us, let his cause endure,\" he concluded at the end of his oration. Outside the cathedral, hundreds more mourners listened in silence as the service was broadcast in the nearby Barony Hall. Many of Mr Dewar's friends and constituents watched the ceremony via a video link at Knightswood community centre in the first minister's Anniesland constituency. And many more followed the service on television as it was broadcast live to the nation. Others lined the streets of Glasgow to pay tribute to Mr Dewar, whose funeral cortege traveled through the city to a private family ceremony at Clydebank crematorium. A single red rose lay on top of his coffin. The mourners were led by Mr Dewar's two children, Ian and Marion, and his former wife Alison, who was with her husband the Lord Chancellor Lord Irvine. The Prince of Wales, prime minister Tony Blair and many members of the Westminster cabinet were present. The Scottish cabinet arrived at the cathedral led by acting first minister Jim Wallace. Mr Blair read from the Old Testament. Mr Dewar died from a brain haemorrhage last Wednesday at the age of 63. He had been taken to Edinburgh's western general hospital after falling outside his official resident in the capital Bute House the previous day.

      "body": "<p>Nicolas Kent, who runs the Tricycle Theatre in north London, has done as much as anyone in British theatre to raise our consciousness of race issues. It was he who presented the most important play of last year - The Colour of Justice, a work that dealt with the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. So when I asked Kent whether British theatre is racist, whether there is a prejudice against black and Asian companies, whether our theatre fails to reflect the cultural diversity of modern Britain, I expected him to be critical. What I did not expect was a wholesale indictment of theatrical racism and a vigorous seminar on the subject. </p> <p>We were talking in Kent's office 90 minutes before the Tricycle's curtain rose on an intriguing double bill. The plays were Alice Childress's Wine in the Wilderness - a 1969 black American play - and Winsome Pinnock's Water, a modern British response to it. When I asked Kent if there is a crisis in black theatre in Britain, he went off like a rocket. </p> <p>\"Absolutely,\" he said. \"A total crisis. In the past two years alone a number of companies and events have disappeared: Carib, Temba, Double Edge, the Black Theatre Season, the Roundhouse Project. Along with the companies, the regular African-Caribbean audience is also dissolving. But I could go on and on listing the problems. The fact that there is no theatre building run by a black or Asian director, that there is no black children's company and that theatre staffs and boards are overwhelmingly white. If you read the Arts Council-commissioned Boyden Report into English Producing Theatres, you discover that only 16 out of 463 board members nationwide are black. Given that we at the Tricycle have eight of them, Stratford East five and Hampstead two, that must leave one black board member for the rest of the country.\" </p> <p>But hasn't some progress has been made? The National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, for instance, actively pursue a policy of integrated casting that transcends mere tokenism. \"That's welcome,\" says Kent. \"But it's not the real issue any more than are the kind of cosmetic schemes dreamed up by the London Arts Board. We don't just need to be told that the RSC is to have a black Henry VI. What we need is enough money to support black companies to do black-generated work. I think we also need to confront our own racism on a personal and institutional level. The press and broadcasting media, for instance, have a built-in racism that is just as pervasive as anything you will find in the theatre.\" </p> <p>All the facts support Kent's arguments about the British theatre. Once there were 18 revenue-funded black and Asian theatre companies, now there are two. All but 80 of the 2,009 staff permanently employed in English theatres are white. And with odd exceptions - such as a season of short plays called Ticket to Write produced by Paines Plough and West Yorkshire Playhouse - contemporary black and Asian experience goes largely unrecorded. </p> <p>Yet within all this I discover a strange paradox. While Kent attends to pressing first-night matters, he asks three colleagues to add their perspectives. In defiance of economic logic and social fact, it is their overwhelming faith in the future that hits me between the eyes. Two of them, both Kent protegees, have the advantage of youth. Gemma Emmanuel-Waterton is a trainee administrator who radiates energy the moment she walks into a room. In July 2001 she will be running a black arts festival called Push, on the South Bank. If there is a crisis in black theatre, she thinks it's partly because young artists are drawn to the economic security of TV. \"Racism,\" she says, \"is my last port of call as an excuse.\" </p> <p>Surian Fletcher-Jones, an Asian director, also finds she has acquired enough confidence and contacts at the Tricycle to launch herself into the freelance world. And actor Ray Shell, who spent four years in Starlight Express and who is writing a new musical, talks animatedly about the melting-pot mateyness he finds in his part of the east end. None of the three is complacent. Each desperately wants to raise black and Asian profile. But each has a fiery positiveness that counterpoints Kent's legitimate sense of crisis. </p> <p>So too does the Tricycle's double bill. It puts to shame much of the gilded shit that currently passes for entertainment in the West End. Winsome Pinnock's Water is a fascinating two-hander about a young black painter, famed for the raw, blood-and-guts veracity of her work, who turns out under journalistic probing to be not quite what she seems. Like Welles's F for Fake, it deals with questionable notions of authenticity in art. Vigorously performed by Cecilia Noble and Gary McDonald, it also suggests that much overhyped Britart is a load of bull and that, in our celebrity-crazed culture, the hoaxer is the ultimate hero. </p> <p>Whereas Pinnock's play is about the commercial value of artistic lies, Alice Childress's Wine in the Wilderness, originally written for American television, is about the moral value of personal truth. The setting is a Harlem studio at the time of the 1964, riots where a young artist is painting an iconic triptych exploring black womanhood. Youthful innocence and mythic nobility have been done. Now he needs an image of messed-up modernity and, to that end, is provided with a brash factory worker named Tomorrow whose flat has just been burned to the ground. </p> <p>Essentially, this is a variation on the Pygmalion story. Instead of a statue that comes to life we have a funky Harlemite who persuades the painter that real beauty is to be found not in dead myths but in the rich variety of 1960s black America. Childress sometimes makes her points with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, but the play has a soaringly affirmative conclusion, reminiscent of Arnold Wesker's Roots, and yields a stunning central performance from Jenny Jules. A product of the Tricycle's Youth Theatre, she combines an attenuated frame with a spirit as big as Grand Central Station. In her mixture of ebullience and vulnerability, she knocks into several cocked hats the superannuated supermodels and celluloid idols who reduce some theatre critics to pulp. She not only crowns an intricately programmed and richly entertaining evening, but also embodies the perverse paradox of black theatre. On an institutional level, it is in deep crisis. Individually, however, it brims with talent that adds to the joy of life. The real tragedy would be if that talent were wasted because of our theatre's unconscious racism. </p> <p>Wine in the Wilderness and Water are at the Tricycle Theatre, London NW6 (020-7328 1000), till November 11.</p>",

And with odd exceptions - such as a season of short plays called Ticket to Write produced by Paines Plough and West Yorkshire Playhouse - contemporary black and Asian experience goes largely unrecorded. Yet within all this I discover a strange paradox. While Kent attends to pressing first-night matters, he asks three colleagues to add their perspectives. In defiance of economic logic and social fact, it is their overwhelming faith in the future that hits me between the eyes. Two of them, both Kent protegees, have the advantage of youth. Gemma Emmanuel-Waterton is a trainee administrator who radiates energy the moment she walks into a room. In July 2001 she will be running a black arts festival called Push, on the South Bank. If there is a crisis in black theatre, she thinks it's partly because young artists are drawn to the economic security of TV. \"Racism,\" she says, \"is my last port of call as an excuse.\" Surian Fletcher-Jones, an Asian director, also finds she has acquired enough confidence and contacts at the Tricycle to launch herself into the freelance world. And actor Ray Shell, who spent four years in Starlight Express and who is writing a new musical, talks animatedly about the melting-pot mateyness he finds in his part of the east end. None of the three is complacent. Each desperately wants to raise black and Asian profile. But each has a fiery positiveness that counterpoints Kent's legitimate sense of crisis. So too does the Tricycle's double bill. It puts to shame much of the gilded shit that currently passes for entertainment in the West End. Winsome Pinnock's Water is a fascinating two-hander about a young black painter, famed for the raw, blood-and-guts veracity of her work, who turns out under journalistic probing to be not quite what she seems. Like Welles's F for Fake, it deals with questionable notions of authenticity in art. Vigorously performed by Cecilia Noble and Gary McDonald, it also suggests that much overhyped Britart is a load of bull and that, in our celebrity-crazed culture, the hoaxer is the ultimate hero. Whereas Pinnock's play is about the commercial value of artistic lies, Alice Childress's Wine in the Wilderness, originally written for American television, is about the moral value of personal truth. The setting is a Harlem studio at the time of the 1964, riots where a young artist is painting an iconic triptych exploring black womanhood. Youthful innocence and mythic nobility have been done. Now he needs an image of messed-up modernity and, to that end, is provided with a brash factory worker named Tomorrow whose flat has just been burned to the ground. Essentially, this is a variation on the Pygmalion story. Instead of a statue that comes to life we have a funky Harlemite who persuades the painter that real beauty is to be found not in dead myths but in the rich variety of 1960s black America. Childress sometimes makes her points with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, but the play has a soaringly affirmative conclusion, reminiscent of Arnold Wesker's Roots, and yields a stunning central performance from Jenny Jules. A product of the Tricycle's Youth Theatre, she combines an attenuated frame with a spirit as big as Grand Central Station. In her mixture of ebullience and vulnerability, she knocks into several cocked hats the superannuated supermodels and celluloid idols who reduce some theatre critics to pulp. She not only crowns an intricately programmed and richly entertaining evening, but also embodies the perverse paradox of black theatre. On an institutional level, it is in deep crisis. Individually, however, it brims with talent that adds to the joy of life. The real tragedy would be if that talent were wasted because of our theatre's unconscious racism. Wine in the Wilderness and Water are at the Tricycle Theatre, London NW6 (020-7328 1000), till November 11.",

Parents are asked to approve the referral and the child is spoken to about what the scheme can offer. This conversation is, arguably, the most crucial one in the whole process, for no stigma must be attached to attending sessions with Place 2 Be that might put other pupils off attending sessions that range from art and play therapy to straightforward conversation. Remarkably, children who attend appear envied by their classmates. \"It is made to seem an attractive proposition to the kids, and their friends want to come too,\" says Forest. </p> <p>The key to Place 2 Be's success, she says, is the independence of the counsellors. \"We're within the school but were not of the school.

This year's programme ranges from Ralph Fiennes's Richard II to Kiri Te Kanawa. </p> <p>Members must live in a London borough to participate in the scheme and are charged an annual fee of \u00a310 for individuals and \u00a320 for organisations, which currently include hospitals and self-help groups. In return, they receive a regular newsletter (also available on tape and in Braille for people with visual impairments) listing forthcoming events, and reductions on all tickets booked for themselves and friends or relatives accompanying them to events. </p> <p>Many events are sign-interpreted or audio-described for people with hearing or visual impairments, while the free ticket booking service takes into account individual requirements such as the need for wheelchair access.

I'd be bereft of culture without the scheme.\" </p> <p>While Howling attends events with a friend, some members have nobody to accompany them, or find that public transport is inaccessible. The scheme's volunteer driver service addresses these problems, by matching volunteers owning their own transport with members wanting a lift to and from their chosen venue and some company during the event. </p> <p>\"Disabled and older people often face barriers to getting to mainstream arts events, not just to do with access but because they may be alone. The scheme helps to break down these barriers,\" says Julie Reynolds, ticket scheme manager. </p> <p>About 100 volunteers participate in more than 1,000 trips a year. The volunteer's ticket and other expenses, such as petrol and car parking, are covered by Shape, which recruits them through volunteer bureaux across the capital and via local and national media. </p> <p>Gloria Rees-Jones has been a volunteer driver for the past three years and says members are not alone in benefiting from the scheme. A former research psychologist, she says it offers her a chance to combine an interest in opera, theatre and ballet with voluntary work. </p> <p>\"It's very much a two-way thing, particularly as we're both going to something that we enjoy. People who can't usually go out, or who can't afford transport, are delighted that they can have access to these events, and we as volunteers go to a lot of things we couldn't afford to go to and make good friends at the same time,\" Rees-Jones says. </p> <p>At present, the scheme has 1,500 individual and 200 group members, recruited through publications for older or disabled people, or social services departments across London. Members and volunteers meet every two months to discuss ways of improving the scheme and future developments. One priority is attracting more volunteers to meet increased demand for companion drivers. Another idea is to widen the scheme to other leisure activities, including attractions like Madame Tussaud's and Rock Circus. </p> <p>Currently on the agenda is computerising the \"labour-intensive\" manual booking service - a task that Reynolds says will enable staff to spend more time on client care and on promoting the service to new potential users, particularly young disabled people.

When she moved to Scotland, however, she appeared subdued, forgetful and increasingly prone to flashes of anger. In top level meetings, she failed to shine. \"From having been an enthusiastic participant in all professional discussions, she became a shadowy, quiet presence who contributed little,\" says Scott. By 1974, four years after moving north, she was so distracted that elaborate arrangements were made to look after her when she attended meetings outside the Scottish Office.

      "body": "<p>As social services leaders meet today in Edinburgh for the start of the sector's annual conference, many will be exercised by problems caused by rising numbers of children being looked after by local authorities. At a meeting last week between councillors in the north-west and the Local Government Association, a majority of councils complained that growing numbers of children in care - many of them with complex needs - were leading to budget deficits. Salford city council is warning it faces a \"social timebomb\" as it struggles to cope with a 75% increase in numbers over the past six years. </p> <p>Elsewhere in the north-west, Wigan, Rochdale and Bury, in particular, say they are facing substantial overspends. In the Greater Manchester area as a whole, where at least 4,000 children are now in care, almost half the authorities say their budgets are under pressure. </p> <p>While north-west councils have been particularly vocal, Rob Hutchinson, who chairs the Association of Directors of Social Services' children and families committee, says most authorities are experiencing increases in the number of children in care. Latest figures from the Department of Health show an overall increase of 4% last year, continuing an upward trend from a low point in 1994-95, with an even more marked rise in the number of children entering care as a result of care orders granted by the courts. </p> <p>Why should this be so? Anne Williams, Salford's social services director, says independent research shows that the increase experienced by her authority is not attributable to her staff getting tougher or being more willing to seek care orders. Her belief, shared by several other directors, is that social services are being asked to cope with the consequences of much broader changes in society. </p> <p>In Salford's case at least, Williams says that although there has been a steady, though moderate, rate of increase in the number of children coming into care, the main reason for the overall trend has been an inability to safely discharge children back into the community. Some of this is because of the children's often complex needs, demonstrated perhaps in challenging and inappropriate behaviour as a result of abuse or severe neglect. </p> <p>Other factors might be that parents cannot continue to care for their children or that, increasingly, several children from one family have to be taken into care at the same time - making it difficult not only to keep them together while in care, but also to discharge them together. </p> <p>Williams and Wigan's director of social services, Bernard Walker, point to a number of worrying trends. In some areas, families are suffering from the effects of two or even three cycles of deprivation through poverty, poor health, inadequate housing, and often substance misuse. There continues to be an increase in some parts in the number of very young parents, including lone parents, who might be less able to parent adequately. And as Hutchinson points out: \"Compared to 20 years ago, we're seeing a really substantial increase in the number of young parents in particular with major drug and alcohol misuse problems.\" </p> <p>Penny Thompson, Sheffield's director of social services concurs with such analysis. Her authority has seen the number of children in care rise from 568 in 1998 to 724 today, she says, and only a small element of this growth has resulted from improvements in social workers' practice standards. </p> <p>Authorities' difficulties are compounded by the increase in use of care orders, especially for emergency admissions, as opposed to voluntary arrangements agreed with parents. The neglect or other damage suffered by children is often quite severe, and is then followed by a traumatic separation and a hunt by the authority for an appropriate placement. </p> <p>Hutchinson, director at Portsmouth, points out that foster carers are now being asked to carry out a quite different, often much more difficult, job than they were two decades ago. It is hardly surprising, he says, that some authorities are facing very serious problems recruiting foster carers, despite the offer of better financial recompense. </p> <p>As a consequence of all this, there has been a marked upturn in the use of placements in specialist facilities. This, the affected authorities argue, has created substantial extra pressures on their children and families departmental budgets. Recent research for north-west authorities, carried out by charity NCH Action for Children, suggests they are spending \u00a338m a year on placements with specialist outside agencies. The research also shows that 60% of these placements with independent sector agencies are made straight away - that is, the agencies are not used as a placement \"of last resort\" after in-house placements have failed. </p> <p>Few would argue that it is realistic to expect social services departments to be able to offer a wide range of residential or other specialist services. But both Walker and Hutchinson maintain there is a \"sellers' market\" and, consequently, authorities are often having to pay whatever fees are required. They want the health department to recognise these cost implications in advance of the chancellor's comprehensive spending review. </p> <p>But what of the government's Quality Protects, Sure Start, neighbourhood renewal schemes and other initiatives aimed at improving family and community life? Are they not helping the situation? </p> <p>Thompson stresses that such schemes are giving a welcome boost to authorities' efforts to carry out preventative work, which may help to reverse the seemingly inexorable rise in the number of neglected and abused children and young people. But the effects may take some years to address both the underlying problems and the cash crises being faced by so many social services departments. </p> <p> They are also in danger of \"creaming off\" some of the most experienced childcare staff: one director, who asked not to be named, maintains that the health department failed to examine the workforce implications of these new initiatives and that experienced staff are being lost to them. \"They offer less stressful and more creative career opportunities,\" he says. </p> <p>Hutchinson concludes that the department, which is currently sponsoring research into the rise in the number of children looked after, should be considering how to integrate both mainstream and other childcare work. \"We are talking about the welfare of children who are very vulnerable, and I think we should be thinking about using the care management and community care planning systems for adults in children's services,\" he says. \"Local authorities need to be able to tailor packages of care for children - that way, resources could more directly go towards meeting their needs, rather than being apportioned to this or that in-house or external service.\" </p>",

      "body": "<p>They came with turquoise and yellow macaw-feather headdresses, carved javelins, bows and arrows, teeth and beads, and faces painted with achote \"war\" paint. Seventy people in three canoes - elders, shamans, leaders, archers and Amazonian women. They came to seek justice armed with a few of modernity's arrows: a copy of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) convention No. 169 on indigenous and tribal rights, the title deeds to their land and two documentary film-makers. </p> <p>The destination was an illegal goldmine, two hours upriver by motorised canoe from Tres Islas in Madre de Dios, Peru. The Shipibo, one of the indigenous peoples of Peru, own this land and, supported by other indigenous groups, they are on the warpath. </p> <p>Gold miners have taken over an area amounting to between a half and a third of their land. Though they have \"legal\" concessions, they have not, as required, obtained permission from the Shipibo. In law the concessions are invalid. The Shipibo want the miners out. The miners don't look set to leave. The authorities move firmly between inaction and inertia. So the Shipibo have taken to their canoes. </p> <p>Indigenous peoples of Madre de Dios have long suffered at the hands of rubber barons, Catholic and Evangelical god-barons, \"eco-tourism\" barons and gold barons. Gold mining in rainforest areas is profoundly destructive; gold extraction uses mercury, which gets washed into the river, contaminating the fish. The river is also contaminated by oil, leaking batteries and other discharges, and silted up with soil and stones dug out of the forest in vast swathes. Flora and fauna are destroyed. The Shipibo see this as colonisation - a conquest in a long tradition. </p> <p>With whoops and clapping, the Shipibos reach the first mine. The manager and owner sit in their shack, behind a set of scales for weighing the gold. Ranged around the hut on small hilltops are young Shipibo archers, bows drawn, ready for defence. They fear that, as in other protests against mining, the miners will set dogs on them, or shoot them. </p> <p>The talking begins. The Shipibos explain their views politely. Their way of negotiating has a graceful, fundamental democracy: the leaders report what the community's wishes are - it is not their role to do more. </p> <p>The mine owner tells them he has no intention of leaving. Instead he offers them money. All hell breaks loose. \"You came and destroyed our land and you offer us dollars. Tranquillity is worth more than dollars,\" says their leader. In a symbolic act, the shaman takes out his machete and begins sharpening his arrows. </p> <p>The Shipibos reboard the canoes to head for the next mine. This is the big one. Acre after acre of jungle surrounding a long-loved lake has been turned to shingle and dust. The Shipibo had wanted to build an eco-tourist lodge, which they would manage. But this sustainable project has been blasted away by the mining. </p> <p>Where they remember dense forests shimmering with life, they now walk through a devastated land, appalled. Small fires burn, charred tree stumps scrape the empty horizons, rusting machinery litters puddles of water thick with oozing oil. To the Shipibos this is tragedy. \"If the earth is maltreated, it's as if we ourselves are maltreated,\" says one of their leaders. </p> <p>The mine owner insists that, by holding a concession, he has the right to do this. It throws up one of the most malignant examples of laws governing land: the \"land\" belongs to the Shipibo, but everything underneath it and above it belongs to the state, and can thus be given to miners, making the idea of \"land\" paper-thin. It also clashes with the holistic indigenous world view which includes all land, including subsoil and trees. </p> <p>This land, repeats the owner, is my land. In sudden revolt, the Shipibos move to the heart of the mining operations and simply \"undo\" it. They dismember it, pulling out dredging pipes, carefully taking apart the platforms for sifting gold. Nothing is broken: \"Tranquillo, tranquillo,\" say the leaders. </p> <p>They meet no resistance. Night falls. The canoes head over to the far river bank. In minutes, wigwams are erected, with banana-leaf coverings for the torrential rain. In the cool morning, the canoes return to the mine. The police have arrived after being called by the miners. </p> <p>The Shipibos offer the police a guided tour of all the illegalities on the ground and of the international law on paper. Eventually the police draft an agreement setting a date for the miners to leave. For the Shipibos, it's a huge victory. And a moral victory for wise - and above all peaceful - direct action. \"Our way is not to be violent,\" they say.</p>",

      "bodyText": "They came with turquoise and yellow macaw-feather headdresses, carved javelins, bows and arrows, teeth and beads, and faces painted with achote \"war\" paint. Seventy people in three canoes - elders, shamans, leaders, archers and Amazonian women. They came to seek justice armed with a few of modernity's arrows: a copy of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) convention No. 169 on indigenous and tribal rights, the title deeds to their land and two documentary film-makers. The destination was an illegal goldmine, two hours upriver by motorised canoe from Tres Islas in Madre de Dios, Peru. The Shipibo, one of the indigenous peoples of Peru, own this land and, supported by other indigenous groups, they are on the warpath. Gold miners have taken over an area amounting to between a half and a third of their land. Though they have \"legal\" concessions, they have not, as required, obtained permission from the Shipibo. In law the concessions are invalid. The Shipibo want the miners out. The miners don't look set to leave. The authorities move firmly between inaction and inertia. So the Shipibo have taken to their canoes. Indigenous peoples of Madre de Dios have long suffered at the hands of rubber barons, Catholic and Evangelical god-barons, \"eco-tourism\" barons and gold barons. Gold mining in rainforest areas is profoundly destructive; gold extraction uses mercury, which gets washed into the river, contaminating the fish. The river is also contaminated by oil, leaking batteries and other discharges, and silted up with soil and stones dug out of the forest in vast swathes. Flora and fauna are destroyed. The Shipibo see this as colonisation - a conquest in a long tradition. With whoops and clapping, the Shipibos reach the first mine. The manager and owner sit in their shack, behind a set of scales for weighing the gold. Ranged around the hut on small hilltops are young Shipibo archers, bows drawn, ready for defence. They fear that, as in other protests against mining, the miners will set dogs on them, or shoot them. The talking begins. The Shipibos explain their views politely. Their way of negotiating has a graceful, fundamental democracy: the leaders report what the community's wishes are - it is not their role to do more. The mine owner tells them he has no intention of leaving. Instead he offers them money. All hell breaks loose. \"You came and destroyed our land and you offer us dollars. Tranquillity is worth more than dollars,\" says their leader. In a symbolic act, the shaman takes out his machete and begins sharpening his arrows. The Shipibos reboard the canoes to head for the next mine. This is the big one. Acre after acre of jungle surrounding a long-loved lake has been turned to shingle and dust. The Shipibo had wanted to build an eco-tourist lodge, which they would manage. But this sustainable project has been blasted away by the mining. Where they remember dense forests shimmering with life, they now walk through a devastated land, appalled. Small fires burn, charred tree stumps scrape the empty horizons, rusting machinery litters puddles of water thick with oozing oil. To the Shipibos this is tragedy. \"If the earth is maltreated, it's as if we ourselves are maltreated,\" says one of their leaders. The mine owner insists that, by holding a concession, he has the right to do this. It throws up one of the most malignant examples of laws governing land: the \"land\" belongs to the Shipibo, but everything underneath it and above it belongs to the state, and can thus be given to miners, making the idea of \"land\" paper-thin. It also clashes with the holistic indigenous world view which includes all land, including subsoil and trees. This land, repeats the owner, is my land. In sudden revolt, the Shipibos move to the heart of the mining operations and simply \"undo\" it. They dismember it, pulling out dredging pipes, carefully taking apart the platforms for sifting gold. Nothing is broken: \"Tranquillo, tranquillo,\" say the leaders. They meet no resistance. Night falls. The canoes head over to the far river bank. In minutes, wigwams are erected, with banana-leaf coverings for the torrential rain. In the cool morning, the canoes return to the mine. The police have arrived after being called by the miners. The Shipibos offer the police a guided tour of all the illegalities on the ground and of the international law on paper. Eventually the police draft an agreement setting a date for the miners to leave. For the Shipibos, it's a huge victory. And a moral victory for wise - and above all peaceful - direct action. \"Our way is not to be violent,\" they say.",

She lives deep in the forests of Siberut, one of the remote Mentawai islands off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, where she looks after her father's pigs, along with Bojuok, a crippled old man. </p> <p>\"My world is complete,\" she says. \"I have the gibbons in the trees, the sago which I help harvest from the palms, and the fish and shrimps which I net in the rivers.\" </p> <p>Sarti's world is no paradise, but it is hers and all she knows. It is a world about to be ripped apart. </p> <p>As Indonesia struggles to solve its economic crisis by increasing exports, oil palm plantations are being established throughout the country's outer islands. It was hoped that Siberut might be spared this fate - in 1981 Unesco had demarcated the island as a man-and-the-biosphere reserve. Its isolation has made it ecologically unique, and home to - among other intriguing things - four endemic species of primate. </p> <p>But while western Siberut is, for the moment, protected by a national park, the government has now begun parcelling out the primary forest in the eastern half of the island. Over the last few months, timber operations have been getting under way - and last week news came that a logging gang is moving into Sarti's neighbourhood. </p> <p>\"They will destroy the trees, the plants, the animals and the water,\" says Amam Maom, Sarti's father. A gaunt man in his 60s, emblazoned with traditional tattoos, he understands the scale of what will be lost. He is a kerei, or medicine man, and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of medicinal herbs. One ethno-botanist, Wanda Av\u00e9, studying the island's indigenous medicines, found that some of his treatments consisted of a mind-boggling 40 different herbal ingredients. </p> <p>Maom picks a tender shoot - it's just one of the species he learned to use during his seven-year apprenticeship as a kerei. \"This one is good for worms, all types of worms,\" he says. He plucks more, apparently at random, and lists their properties, which range from disinfecting cuts to curing the bite of the red tail snake. </p> <p>\"If they cut down the trees, these plants will be crushed and we won't be able to find them any more,\" he says, blinking sadly at the dark undergrowth around us, the world he is about to lose. \"What will we do to protect our health and heal us from sickness?\" </p> <p>To Maom, the forests are a spiritual as well as physical resource. The water, plants, stones are all part of a living system. \"Everything radiates a 'bajou',\" he says, and I understand from the anthropologist Reimar Schefold, this is a radiating energy that has to be respected. Everything has a soul that must be kept content, which is why islanders beautify their bodies with tattoos and flowers. </p> <p>For Sarti - considered too young to endure the painful tattooing process - it's more than a question of wearing a couple of hibiscus blossoms behind her ears; her house must also be decorated with toy birds and palm flags for its pleasure. </p> <p>Now, though, the sound of the chainsaws biting their way through the trees mocks these traditional efforts to achieve harmony. It's not certain what, if anything, will be spared.

Meanwhile, the government plans to import 10,800 transmigrant families to harvest the oil palms. </p> <p>Despite being aware of the coming onslaught, Sarti shows no interest in leaving home. \"I have tried it already,\" she says when I ask her about attending school. \"And I don't like it.\" She tosses the pigs their sago lunch, and talks of her world: \"Yesterday we ate prawns we caught with our hand-held scoop nets.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is 20 years this month since Margaret Thatcher's dream of turning Britain into a nation of property owners - and Conservative voters - was enshrined in law. The 1980 Housing Act, which gave council tenants the right to buy their homes, was at the time hugely controversial. Today, it hardly merits a second thought. </p> <p>Right-to-buy can now been seen to have underpinned a fundamental change in society, breaking down the divide between \"working class\" - for which, read council tenants - and those with middle-class aspirations, who bought their own homes. Now, having an address on a council estate does not automatically earn a working-class tag. In many places, nobody any longer knows who is \"council\" and who is not. More often than not, nobody really cares. </p> <p>Gone, for people who chose to buy the homes they rented for years, are the days when they had to abide by rules and regulations about what they could change in their house. Gone are the restrictions on moving to another part of the country, either for a job or in retirement. But what has been left in its place? </p> <p>Alan Murie, professor at the school of urban and regional studies, Birmingham University, believes right-to-buy has, in part, been responsible for the increased divide between haves and have-nots. \"It has been good news for most people who bought, but is a one-dimensional policy,\" he says. \"This government is having to deal with the consequences of that. </p> <p>\"You've got the social exclusion unit talking about urban renewal. One of the contributory factors in that has to be the right to buy, which meant people with the fewest choices are concentrated on these estates. There is a greater concentration than there was before; a greater polarisation of society.\" </p> <p>It was in October 1980 that the Conservative government introduced its policy, giving 5.5m council tenants a chance to own their homes. Before then, you could only buy your council home if your local council agreed: many did not. </p> <p>Flagged as the \"sale of the century\", the right to buy was introduced in a \u00a3600,000 blaze of publicity, with Thatcher personally visiting some of the proud new home owners. It forced reluctant councils to sell properties at a price considerably below the open market value. And to add insult to injury, they could only reinvest 25% of the capital they raised on refurbishing remaining housing stock. </p> <p>Many councils fought it, while some members of white-collar public sector union Nalgo (now part of Unison) refused to process right-to-buy applications. Sheffield council took advertisements in its local papers explaining why it did not want to sell. Norwich went all the way to the high court in protest against then environment secretary Michael Heseltine, who was implementing the policy. Norwich lost. The rest is history. </p> <p>Although only 90,000 families bought in the first year - fewer than had been expected - the numbers gradually picked up, peaking in 1989 at 216,043. In 1997, only 70,961 homes were sold. But over 20 years, in England alone, a total of 1.4m homes passed into private ownership. </p> <p>Once drab and regimented council estates suddenly boasted Georgian-style bay windows, double glazing and new extensions at the back. Some took on mock-Tudor frontages. The Sunday People newspaper even ran a competition in 1982 offering a dream holiday for two to the reader for the best transformation of a former council home. </p> <p>Council house sales were regularly higher in London and the south-east. In other parts of the country, where the property market was less buoyant, the policy took longer to take off. In particular, sales in Scotland rose much more slowly than in England. </p> <p> In July last year, Newcastle council was selling homes for a nominal 50p in the notoriously difficult North Benwell area, in the hope of attracting young owner occupiers who would spend money improving the properties. </p> <p>\"In the north, prices are much lower,\" says Murie. \"They are not being bought by affluent people who do them up. Some are being bought by private landlords to let. You get people not being able to sell, for whom buying their home has been the wrong decision.\" </p> <p>Nationally, councils currently have a \u00a320bn backlog in repairs, says Murie. Many of those which once fought the sale of council homes are now forced to consider wholesale stock transfer because they cannot af ford the necessary repairs. Even in militant Sheffield, where 21,477 council homes have been sold since 1980, councillors are this week considering selling the remaining 63,500 properties they still own. </p> <p>\"We still have 11,000 inter-war properties that have not been modernised,\" says Janet Parry, who manages the team considering future options for Sheffield's council housing. \"The toilets are in the porch, they still have the original windows and the kitchens are very basic. To bring those up to standard would be too costly. Over the years, we haven't been able to borrow enough money to invest to the level that we need.\" </p> <p>Merron Simpson, policy officer with the Chartered Institute of Housing, believes it is not too late to improve the right to buy policy. \"The government is trying to give local authorities a stronger strategic role for housing in their area,\" she says. \"But right-to-buy cuts across any idea of strategy, because people can buy their homes after three years. The local authority has no control over that. </p> <p>\"They should also be able to exclude certain properties where demand is high, or in parts of the country, like rural areas, where there is very little council accommodation.\" </p> <p>Ask Murie if right-to-buy has been a success and he is non-committal. \"You could say so. Or you could quite easily say it was totally disastrous. If you are lucky enough to be in a good property in somewhere like Essex, then you probably would benefit. But if you were in Liverpool you could have a very different story to tell.\" </p> <p> <strong>High hopes, low points</strong><br></p> <p> Even in the affluent south-east, where most people who bought their council homes have made a handsome profit, some people have had their fingers burnt. </p> <p>In Grays town centre, Essex, the local council recently bought back 38 high-rise flats at a total cost of \u00a3950,000 after the owners found they could not sell them. Building societies were refusing to give potential new buyers a mortgage. Now the council is letting tenants-turned-owners revert to tenants again. </p> <p>\"I was the first person to run into problems,\" says Lyn Smallcombe, who has a two-bedroom, sixth-floor flat in Lionel Oxley House. \"I bought it in 1989 for \u00a320,750 and put it on the market for just under \u00a330,000 three years later. Six couples came to view it, but each one rang back and said they couldn't get a mortgage on it. </p> <p>\"I wrote to the Halifax, who my mortgage was with, and they said it was in an anti-social area, or that it was a non-conformist building, yet three years before they were quite happy to give the money out to me. </p> <p>\"Then the council - who owned the freehold - decided to improve the building by cladding it, putting new windows in and putting in a new lift. Some of us were left with a \u00a315,000 bill which on an unsaleable property was pretty high.\" </p> <p>Smallcombe and others in the same position began a seven-year battle with Thurrock district council, which was settled earlier this year. \"We kept pushing and pushing and eventually they bought us back, for the original price we paid, but dropping the \u00a315,000 charge for improvements. That way nobody won and nobody lost,\" says Smallcombe. </p> <p>\"It's a relief. It means that I can move on. I am 58 now and when I am 60, if I wanted to, I could go into a smaller place. But it will be a council one, though.\"</p>",

Alan Murie, professor at the school of urban and regional studies, Birmingham University, believes right-to-buy has, in part, been responsible for the increased divide between haves and have-nots. \"It has been good news for most people who bought, but is a one-dimensional policy,\" he says. \"This government is having to deal with the consequences of that. \"You've got the social exclusion unit talking about urban renewal. One of the contributory factors in that has to be the right to buy, which meant people with the fewest choices are concentrated on these estates. There is a greater concentration than there was before; a greater polarisation of society.\" It was in October 1980 that the Conservative government introduced its policy, giving 5.5m council tenants a chance to own their homes. Before then, you could only buy your council home if your local council agreed: many did not. Flagged as the \"sale of the century\", the right to buy was introduced in a \u00a3600,000 blaze of publicity, with Thatcher personally visiting some of the proud new home owners. It forced reluctant councils to sell properties at a price considerably below the open market value. And to add insult to injury, they could only reinvest 25% of the capital they raised on refurbishing remaining housing stock. Many councils fought it, while some members of white-collar public sector union Nalgo (now part of Unison) refused to process right-to-buy applications. Sheffield council took advertisements in its local papers explaining why it did not want to sell. Norwich went all the way to the high court in protest against then environment secretary Michael Heseltine, who was implementing the policy. Norwich lost. The rest is history. Although only 90,000 families bought in the first year - fewer than had been expected - the numbers gradually picked up, peaking in 1989 at 216,043. In 1997, only 70,961 homes were sold. But over 20 years, in England alone, a total of 1.4m homes passed into private ownership. Once drab and regimented council estates suddenly boasted Georgian-style bay windows, double glazing and new extensions at the back. Some took on mock-Tudor frontages. The Sunday People newspaper even ran a competition in 1982 offering a dream holiday for two to the reader for the best transformation of a former council home. Council house sales were regularly higher in London and the south-east. In other parts of the country, where the property market was less buoyant, the policy took longer to take off. In particular, sales in Scotland rose much more slowly than in England. In July last year, Newcastle council was selling homes for a nominal 50p in the notoriously difficult North Benwell area, in the hope of attracting young owner occupiers who would spend money improving the properties. \"In the north, prices are much lower,\" says Murie. \"They are not being bought by affluent people who do them up. Some are being bought by private landlords to let. You get people not being able to sell, for whom buying their home has been the wrong decision.\" Nationally, councils currently have a \u00a320bn backlog in repairs, says Murie. Many of those which once fought the sale of council homes are now forced to consider wholesale stock transfer because they cannot af ford the necessary repairs. Even in militant Sheffield, where 21,477 council homes have been sold since 1980, councillors are this week considering selling the remaining 63,500 properties they still own. \"We still have 11,000 inter-war properties that have not been modernised,\" says Janet Parry, who manages the team considering future options for Sheffield's council housing. \"The toilets are in the porch, they still have the original windows and the kitchens are very basic. To bring those up to standard would be too costly. Over the years, we haven't been able to borrow enough money to invest to the level that we need.\" Merron Simpson, policy officer with the Chartered Institute of Housing, believes it is not too late to improve the right to buy policy. \"The government is trying to give local authorities a stronger strategic role for housing in their area,\" she says. \"But right-to-buy cuts across any idea of strategy, because people can buy their homes after three years. The local authority has no control over that. \"They should also be able to exclude certain properties where demand is high, or in parts of the country, like rural areas, where there is very little council accommodation.\" Ask Murie if right-to-buy has been a success and he is non-committal. \"You could say so. Or you could quite easily say it was totally disastrous. If you are lucky enough to be in a good property in somewhere like Essex, then you probably would benefit. But if you were in Liverpool you could have a very different story to tell.\" High hopes, low points Even in the affluent south-east, where most people who bought their council homes have made a handsome profit, some people have had their fingers burnt. In Grays town centre, Essex, the local council recently bought back 38 high-rise flats at a total cost of \u00a3950,000 after the owners found they could not sell them. Building societies were refusing to give potential new buyers a mortgage. Now the council is letting tenants-turned-owners revert to tenants again. \"I was the first person to run into problems,\" says Lyn Smallcombe, who has a two-bedroom, sixth-floor flat in Lionel Oxley House. \"I bought it in 1989 for \u00a320,750 and put it on the market for just under \u00a330,000 three years later. Six couples came to view it, but each one rang back and said they couldn't get a mortgage on it. \"I wrote to the Halifax, who my mortgage was with, and they said it was in an anti-social area, or that it was a non-conformist building, yet three years before they were quite happy to give the money out to me. \"Then the council - who owned the freehold - decided to improve the building by cladding it, putting new windows in and putting in a new lift. Some of us were left with a \u00a315,000 bill which on an unsaleable property was pretty high.\" Smallcombe and others in the same position began a seven-year battle with Thurrock district council, which was settled earlier this year. \"We kept pushing and pushing and eventually they bought us back, for the original price we paid, but dropping the \u00a315,000 charge for improvements. That way nobody won and nobody lost,\" says Smallcombe. \"It's a relief. It means that I can move on. I am 58 now and when I am 60, if I wanted to, I could go into a smaller place. But it will be a council one, though.\"",

Roger Ford, technical editor of Modern Railways magazine, said that he thought that the cause of the crash would turn out to be a broken rail. \"I think it is a broken rail and, if that is the case, then although it sounds callous, it is really just one of those things,\" he said. \"Rails will break from time to time because of the stresses and strains they are put under. \"I actually thought the next big accident was going to be caused by vandalism, but that doesn't seem to be the case here. \"Also, in this case, if you look at the number of injuries, it shows how strong modern railway carriages are. \"Paddington was the really worrying accident because there it seemed to be a case of failure in driver training.\" Chris Milner, deputy editor of Railway magazine, also said that a mechanical fault with the track or train itself was the most likely cause. There was a derailment two years ago involving the same type of rolling stock as today's fatal crash which investigators put down to metal fatigue. The incident on June 16, 1998, at Sandy, Bedfordshire, involved GNER's nine-coach 17.30 King's Cross to Edinburgh service. However, the particular section of track on which the derailment occurred was continuously welded, which would decrease the chances of a crack appearing, without totally ruling it out. Vandalism Early reports suggested that the rear carriages of the train were derailed rather than the front, which suggests that vandalism may not have been the cause. Mr Milner said: \"If any debris was placed on the line, it would have either been pushed away or caused the front part of the train to derail.\" Stan Hart, principal inspector of railways for the Health and Safety Inspectorate, said he hoped that he thought it unlikely that the crash had anything to do with faulty signals. \"Principally at the moment we are concentrating on the state of the track and the state of the vehicle,\" he said. \"We have not ruled out vandalism and, at this stage, it is difficult to give any indication as to what the cause might be. \"The cause could be vandalism.

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Railtrack, Gerald Corbett, resigned today, as investigations into yesterday's Hatfield train crash focused on the possibility of a broken rail causing the Great North Eastern Railways service to derail. Mr Corbett tendered his resignation and the board is meeting this evening to consider whether or not to accept it. Among the Railtrack board members who will tonight decide the fate of Mr Gerald Corbett's will be Jennifer Page, the sacked chief executive of the Millennium Dome. Ms Page, who earns \u00a326,000 in her role as a part-time board member of Railtrack, will be one of 12 directors at the meeting, which will start after 6pm at Railtrack's head office by Euston station in London. The news came as GNER began a full service once again. Railtrack, the rail infrastructure company that is responsible for maintaining tracks, said that it was \"investigating the possibility of a broken rail being a factor in the tragedy\". At the scene of the crash, a Railtrack director said that a broken rail had been found, but it was not yet known if it was smashed before the accident or during it. The company also today imposed a speed restriction on bends on high-speed lines. This will require drivers to knock a third off their permitted speed in such areas and will lead to inevitable delays for passengers. Seven people were today still in hospital after Tuesday's 12.10pm GNER London to Leeds high-speed train derailed in Hertfordshire. The four men who died in the crash have yet to be named. All were in the buffet car of the train which had its roof torn off after colliding with a trackside pylon. Both Railtrack and GNER agreed today that the crash will lead to renewed anxiety among passengers. Railtrack London and North East Region director Nicholas Pollard said: \"The investigations will continue urgently throughout today.\" He said he was aware that Railtrack could come under heavy fire if the crash was found to be caused by a fault with a rail. \"I am sure people will take that line and I understand that obviously a tragedy of this nature shakes confidence right across the industry in the UK as a whole.\" GNER chief executive Christopher Garnett said that railways were still \"incredibly safe although I do accept that what happened yesterday has shaken people's confidence\". Mr Garnett added that he did not think that the number of serious accidents in recent years was anything to do with rail privatisation. He added: \"There is a perception that rail travel is unsafe, but when you look at the statistics, it is an incredibly safe way of travel.\" But Vernon Hince, of the biggest rail union the RMT, said there had been widespread concern that the privatised rail companies were not observing safety procedures. George Muir, director general of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said that he was certain that \"corners were not cut\". As the search for clues continued, transport minister Lord Macdonald said that he was looking for answers \"in hours and days rather than weeks\". The routes that are most likely to be affected by the Railtrack speed restrictions are the London to Scotland East Coast main line on which the accident happened, the West Coast main line, which also runs from London to Scotland and the Great Western line from London to Bristol and Cardiff. The West Coast line, in particular, has a number of bends. This has prompted Virgin Trains, run by Sir Richard Branson, to invest in high-speed tilting trains which can go faster around curves. They are due to be introduced on the line in 2002 and will considerably reduce journey times from London to the Midlands, north west of England and Scotland. After bringing down the annual number of broken rails in the network, Railtrack had to report a sharp rise in incidents in 1998-99. Although the figure was slightly down in 1999-2000, Rail Regulator Tom Winsor has told Railtrack of his unhappiness with its record on broken rails. Publishing the latest statistics for broken rail, the Health and Safety Executive said that the number was \"still significantly higher than in the mid-1990s\". Another problem, according to provisional HSE figures, is buckles in track. The number of these, which had fallen to 21 in 1998-99, more than trebled to 64 in 1999-2000. Yesterday's accident occurred on a stretch of track that is continuously welded, which should greatly reduce the chances of a rail cracking. But rail experts agree that defects can appear even in welded areas. In its most recent annual report, Railtrack said that the drop in the number of broken rails last year was not enough, but added that track quality was now better than at any time since the mid-1990s. The company has also said that the growth of traffic on the network, particularly heavy freight, has had a major impact on track deterioration. The company has been ensuring that track renewals are targeted at locations where they will have the most effect. Railtrack has also spoken of introducing the UIC60 rail, which is the standard rail used in the rest of Europe. It is stronger than the traditional rail that is used in Britain and needs less maintenance. The company plans to replace an extra 350 miles of rail over the next five years. A total of 68,000 tonnes of new rail has been ordered for this year - the highest amount since 1988. In 1995-96, there were 776 broken rails and 133 track buckles on the network.

In the immediate aftermath of the crash, several possible reasons for the crash were considered, including terrorism,which has since been discounted. A broken wheel was also thought a possible cause, but GNER said today that, as they were convinced that this was not the case, they would be running a service on the route today. Vandalism is another possibility that has not been ruled out, but that seems unlikely, as it would be expected that the front of the train would have been derailed before the middle carriages.

Tony Blair and his minister in charge of transport, John Prescott, wanted a high-profile resignation to restore public confidence in the railways, and in the government.</p> <p>Corbett survived, but his tussles with the rail regulator resumed. Only two months ago, he was warned by the latest regulator, Tom Winsor, that the company had failed to achieve \"an appreciable reduction\" in the number of broken rails - a possible cause of the latest tragedy at Hatfield.</p> <p>In an August 4 letter to Corbett, Winsor said that he was \"not satisfied that Railtrack is taking all appropriate steps to secure or facilitate compliance with its network licence\".</p> <p>He was appointing, he said, independent consultants to examine the broken-rails issue. The letter followed an earlier warning on June.</p> <p>Corbett, 49, is now on an annual basic salary of \u00a3377,000, with another \u00a321,000 in benefits.</p> <p>He waived an estimated \u00a3100,000 annual bonus in the summer following last year's Paddington crash.</p> <p>If his resignation is accepted, little public mourning is expected. But in industry and political circles, Corbett is still widely admired.</p> <p>Shadow environment secretary Archie Norman said: \"I fully understand Gerald Corbett's reasons for tendering his resignation.</p> <p>\"This has been another appalling tragedy. But he is widely recognised as one of the more talented managers of his generation.\"</p> <p>George Muir, director general of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said that Corbett had brought \"fresh air and energy\" to the industry.

The office of the rail regulator was harder to handle, and, as Corbett wrestled with the intricate finances of Railtrack, he came under remorseless pressure to invest more in maintaining and renewing the crumbling infrastructure of the network. In September 1997, just three months after Corbett took the top job, an intercity express from Swansea ploughed into a freight train at Southall, West London. Seven passengers were killed, and public disquiet about the state of the railways became an angry swell of criticism. Thirteen months later, another intercity train collided with a commuter train outside Paddington station, killing 31 people. It was Britain's worst rail disaster in a decade, and Corbett came under immense pressure to resign from his \u00a37,600-a-week post. The pressure was not just from the public. Tony Blair and his minister in charge of transport, John Prescott, wanted a high-profile resignation to restore public confidence in the railways, and in the government. Corbett survived, but his tussles with the rail regulator resumed. Only two months ago, he was warned by the latest regulator, Tom Winsor, that the company had failed to achieve \"an appreciable reduction\" in the number of broken rails - a possible cause of the latest tragedy at Hatfield. In an August 4 letter to Corbett, Winsor said that he was \"not satisfied that Railtrack is taking all appropriate steps to secure or facilitate compliance with its network licence\". He was appointing, he said, independent consultants to examine the broken-rails issue. The letter followed an earlier warning on June. Corbett, 49, is now on an annual basic salary of \u00a3377,000, with another \u00a321,000 in benefits. He waived an estimated \u00a3100,000 annual bonus in the summer following last year's Paddington crash. If his resignation is accepted, little public mourning is expected. But in industry and political circles, Corbett is still widely admired. Shadow environment secretary Archie Norman said: \"I fully understand Gerald Corbett's reasons for tendering his resignation. \"This has been another appalling tragedy. But he is widely recognised as one of the more talented managers of his generation.\" George Muir, director general of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said that Corbett had brought \"fresh air and energy\" to the industry. His resignation would be a loss to the industry.

      "body": "<p>In early 1982, I was a junior officer on board the Royal Navy nuclear submarine HMS Conqueror when it torpedoed and sank the Argentinian cruiser the General Belgrano. Hit by two torpedoes on the afternoon of May 2, the ship sank within an hour, leaving approximately 290 crew members dead and a further 30 dying of burns and exposure as they took to their liferafts in the icy waters of the south Atlantic.</p> <p>In early January 2000, I stumbled across a message on a website, in which an American gentleman, Lew Holt, asked if anyone knew of people who had served in HMS Conqueror. I responded that I had been in the submarine, and asked what I could do for him.</p> <p>Lew explained that his older brother, Bill, had served in the second world war on the light cruiser USS Phoenix - later sold to Argentina and renamed the General Belgrano. The Phoenix had survived the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, but Bill had died of tuberculosis shortly before the end of the war. Half a century later, Lew decided to compile a book about his brother and to research the history of the ship on which he had served and which was eventually sent to the depths of the south Atlantic.</p> <p>As our correspondence developed, Lew mentioned that he was in touch with a former Belgrano crew member, Captain Nestor Cenci, known universally as \"Coco\". On January 19 2000, I wrote to him for the first time. I told him that, while recognising that men on both sides had \"done their duty\", I nevertheless greatly regretted the heavy loss of life and hoped that he would feel able to write back and \"shake hands\", so to speak, via email.</p> <p>Just one day later, he did so. He told me that it was hard for him even to think of the sinking and that he preferred not to discuss it at this stage. As the ship's supply officer, he had been third in charge of the Belgrano during the Falklands War. He had retired from the Argentinian Navy in 1988 with the rank of captain, but had been unable to find work. I was thrilled to receive Coco's letter and, for the following few months, we exchanged emails. We did not talk about the Falklands or the Belgrano, but about family, where we lived and other mundane matters.</p> <p>As time passed, our cyber-friendship grew and I told Coco that I hoped I would be able to visit Argentina one day, and to meet him in person. Just a few months later, that aspiration became a reality when, one chilly morning in mid September, I arrived at Buenos Aires international airport.</p> <p>Coco was waiting for me as I emerged from the baggage hall. At 61, he looked slightly older than his years and stooped slightly. I dropped my bag, saluted him and then walked towards him. We immediately embraced, like old friends. He then drove me to his home in a suburb of Buenos Aires and introduced me to his wife, Martha. An enormous breakfast waited on the table and, between us, in my halting Spanish and his slightly better English, we were able to communicate.</p> <p>For some days, I stayed with Coco and his family and, on occasions, usually over lunch, when the wine bottle was more empty than full, we would speak of the Belgrano and her sinking. Memories came flooding back.</p> <p>By May 1 1982, Conqueror's sonar had already detected the cruiser Belgrano, and the Exocet-armed destroyers Hippolito Bouchard and Piedrabuena. The submarine shadowed the vessels and, while keeping watch on the periscope, I sighted the tops of masts on the distant horizon. Excitedly, I called out that I could see the vessels, and when I relayed the bearing, the sonar operators confirmed that the ships were indeed the Belgrano and her escorts. When I looked again on the same bearing, they were closer and I could see their hulls and make out that there were four vessels, apparently steaming abeam of each other and engaged in a fuel replenishment operation. It was a thrilling moment.</p> <p>For more than a day, unauthorised to attack the ships as they remained outside the British-enforced total exclusion zone, we shadowed the Belgrano group. The following day, May 2 1982, Conqueror received a signal authorising the submarine to attack the Argentinian ships.</p> <p>At 3pm, Conqueror's crew was called to action stations and the torpedo tubes were loaded. The atmosphere in the submarine's control room was intense yet each individual went about his job professionally and calmly as various orders were given to prepare for the attack.</p> <p>Around 4pm, the order was given to fire and three torpedoes sped towards the Belgrano. The seconds ticked away and my pulse raced. This was the moment for which we had all been trained, yet a moment which, I believe, few of us ever really thought we would encounter. Until the moment of firing, it was as if everything in our lives had been a dress rehearsal for a performance that would never be given. But at that moment, our lives changed and we knew that the dress rehearsal was over. The Belgrano had real people on board. And we had just fired three high-explosive torpedoes at her.</p> <p>Shortly after firing, we heard and felt an enormous explosion. Conqueror's commanding officer, Commander Chris Wreford-Brown, called out from the periscope that he could see flashes of orange flame. The submarine's control room erupted in cheers as we realised that the weapons had hit.</p> <p>At the moment that the first torpedo hit the cruiser, Coco was resting in his bunk. Suddenly, the lights extinguished, and he heard a muffled explosion. The ship seemed to rise out of the water, as if it had hit a sand bank. Fighting his way through the smoke-filled darkness, he rushed to his watchkeeping position on the bridge and, as he did so, the second torpedo tore off the Belgrano's bows. By the time he reached the bridge, the Belgrano was taking on a list, and Coco found the ship's captain, Hector Bonzo, trying to turn the stricken ship to port, to face the submarine and thus present a smaller target. But his efforts were in vain - the vessel's major systems were all destroyed and she was already listing heavily.</p> <p>While Coco clung to the Belgrano's bridge, Conqueror was diving deep, shuddering from the force of the explosions and wondering if the cruiser's escorts were dropping depth charges. The crew was no longer cheering. We ran for an hour, away from the scene of carnage, so that we could raise an aerial and tell the world what we had done. Thinking that we were being depth-charged and that the Argentian destroyers were hunting us, we carried out evasive manoeuvres. That evening we were all stunned at what had happened. Within 20 minutes of the attack, the Belgrano was heeling some 30 degrees and the order was given to abandon ship. Coco left the bridge and climbed down into his life raft. A storm was whipping up, and conditions were rapidly deteriorating. I felt myself blushing as Coco spoke, but there was no animosity in his voice.</p> <p>\"On my life raft, there were 33 men,\" he said. \"The life rafts were designed to hold 12 people\". He smiled. \"They were very good liferafts, yes, very, very good\".</p> <p>I asked him what it had been like in the rafts, waiting for rescue. He looked pained. \"Cold,\" he said, shaking his head, \"very cold. It was 36 hours before we were rescued. The sea was very rough, with 30ft waves. Fortunately, the body heat from 33 men enabled us to survive. Some life rafts had only four or five people in them, and they died from exposure\". I blushed again.</p> <p>On the night of May 2 1982, I - and many other of Conqueror's crew - found it hard to sleep. I wondered how many men had been killed. But while I lay, dry, in my bunk, Coco spent that night in mountainous seas, in bitterly cold conditions, with wounded and dying survivors around him.</p> <p>Some 36 hours after being torpedoed, the Belgrano's survivors were rescued by the Argentinian ships Hippolito Bouchard, Piedrabuena and Gurruchaga, and taken to the Argentinian naval base at Puerto Belgrano.</p> <p>\"The press were not allowed there,\" Coco explained. \"When you went home with HMS Conqueror, you had the press to meet you and your families to welcome you back. When we went home, there was no one. It was as if no one wanted to see us, as if we were to feel ashamed.\"</p> <p>He paused and looked sad. \"It was a terrible time, a really terrible time. But the worst moment of all came when we assembled in an aircraft hangar to work out who was alive and who wasn't. We called out the names of the crew. Sometimes there would be a response and you knew that the person was alive. But often there was no response, and you knew, with great sadness, that the person was dead.\" Coco's pension, after 30 years of service, is $1,200 (about \u00a3750) per month. Although he didn't say it, I sensed that he felt poorly treated by the navy, forgotten and put out to pasture. I asked him about Captain Bonzo and he told me that Bonzo had been \"sent into retirement\" and now spent his time trying to \"help\" the relatives of those who had perished on the Belgrano.</p> <p>One morning, a few days into my stay in Argentina, Coco said to me: \"Barcena wants to meet you.\" I asked him who Barcena was. \"Barcena? The captain of the destroyer, the Hippolito Bouchard\".</p> <p>The Bouchard had been escorting the Belgrano at the time of her sinking and it was reported after the war that the third torpedo fired by HMS Conqueror had actually hit the Bouchard but failed to detonate. Later it was found that she had four five-inch cracks in her hull and Barcena later told me himself that the torpedo had in fact exploded, but close to the destroyer rather than on contact with her.</p> <p>Captain Washington Barcena and his wife arrived at Coco's house around 8.30pm in the evening. He looked younger than his 61 years, wore a jacket and tie and had an air of formality about him. We shook hands and then sat down with a glass of wine. He spoke little English, and so Coco acted as interpreter. \"He wants to ask you a question,\" said Coco. \"Sethia,\" said Barcena, \"when did you first detect our ships?\"</p> <p>Did he mean me personally? I asked. He replied yes. It was an easy question to answer because the moment has remained vivid in my mind for the past 18 years. I told him that I had first seen the ships while on the periscope on May 1, but that they had been detected by HMS Conqueror prior to that first visual sighting.\" Without thinking, I then added: \"And I thought to myself 'What a great target that would make.' \"</p> <p>He nodded and I asked him if his ship had dropped any depth charges on the Conqueror or tried to find the submarine by operating his sonar. \"No,\" he replied, \"we never fired any weapons. What you felt must have been the exploding ammunition and boilers on the Belgrano. You see, we didn't have many weapons on board and we wanted to keep them, maybe for a later engagement. And the sonar - well, it was working but it was a very old and not much good.\"</p> <p>I asked Barcena if his ship had carried Exocet missiles, and he confirmed that it had, but when I asked Coco the same question, whether the Belgrano had carried Exocets, he laughed and told me that the Belgrano's carpenters had fabricated Exocet launchers out of wood, to make it look as if the cruiser carried the missiles. He added that the Belgrano was not even fitted with sonar.</p> <p>\"So what did you do once you realised that the Belgrano had been sunk?\" I asked Barcena. \"We moved away from the area,\" he replied. \"We were worried that the submarine might come back and try to attack us.\" Barcena excused himself and shortly returned with an envelope, which he handed to me. Inside was a photograph of the Hippolito Bouchard, and Barcena had written a moving note, saying that, while we had been enemies 18 years previously, he was happy to have personally met me and wished me all good things for the future. When he left, I said to Coco that I found it surprising that the Hippolito Bouchard had moved so quickly away from the area of the attack and Coco bowed his head and spoke quietly. \"I have often wondered,\" he said, \"why it took 36 hours for us to be rescued.\"</p> <p>A few days later, Coco excitedly announced that he had had a call from Bonzo. He said that he had previously tried to arrange for me to meet the captain of the Belgrano, but that Bonzo had retorted: \"Why would I want to meet a man who tried to kill me?\" A fair enough response, I thought. Now he had called again, to say that he would meet me in a cafe in downtown Buenos Aires.</p> <p>We arrived at the cafe early, and, as the minutes ticked by, Coco nervously tapped his fingers on the table. After a while, he sat up straight and said: \"He is here.\"</p> <p>I turned around and saw a man in a blue anorak walking slowly towards us. His face was grim, and I recognised him from an old photo I had seen. As he reached our table, I stood up and held out my hand. He took it and looked me in the eye. \"It's an honour, sir\", I said in my poor Spanish, \"finally to meet you.\" He simply nodded and sat down next to me.</p> <p>Although they had not met for many years, and although both had been retired from the armed forces for more than a decade and were of the same rank, I noticed that Coco always addressed Bonzo as \"senor\" - \"sir\". From time to time, Bonzo nodded and glanced at me, not in an unfriendly manner, but neither with palpable warmth.The two chatted, and occasionally I heard Bonzo mention my name.</p> <p>The atmosphere was tense, and while I understood snippets of their exchange, much of it eluded me. Bonzo then turned to me and spoke in Spanish. He told me that, in his view, the sinking of the Belgrano had been \"politically criminal\". I nodded and told him that I agreed with him and I felt that he hesitated at that, as if to take another, closer look at me.</p> <p>I asked Coco if it was true that the Belgrano had been steaming home to Argentina and he said that, yes, this was true. In Captain Bonzo's book, \"Los 1,093 Tripulantes\" (The 1,093 crew) Bonzo had suggested that he might, at a later stage, have changed course to the east, back towards the Falkland Islands, but both Coco and Barcena told me that they had been heading west, heading home. Bonzo's hands were unhealthily white with little flesh and tensed knuckles. While age had been kinder to him than to Coco, he nevertheless did not look a well man, and Coco told me that for this meeting, he had made his first unescorted excursion from his apartment in a long time. I felt, as we sat there and talked, that there was no personal animosity against the individuals who had carried out their duty in HMS Conqueror. But it seemed to me that Bonzo, in particular, harboured some resentment over the politics which had led to the sinking in the first place. He struck me as a proud man, a professional naval officer \"of the old school\", and I sensed that he regarded himself as a man who had been terribly wronged.</p> <p>I told both Bonzo and Coco that, for my own part, I felt no remorse at having carried out my duty, but tremendous remorse that that duty had required me to be a party to the sinking of the Belgrano, and I think that they both respected and understood this sentiment.</p> <p>Suddenly, Bonzo looked at me and said, in English: \"So you were born in Scotland? My wife and I were there, many years ago. It is a lovely country,\" and he smiled. The ice had finally been broken and his smile was genuine. Neither Coco nor myself had realised that he could speak English and, by doing so, I felt that he was extending an olive branch.</p> <p>We talked for an hour or so, and neither the Conqueror nor the Belgrano was mentioned again. There seemed to be no need to do so. A retired Argentinian naval captain, \"El Commandante\", as Bonzo is usually referred to, and a retired junior Lieutenant were chatting and drinking coffee in a cafe in Buenos Aires. One had had his ship torpedoed with the loss of 323 members of his crew. The other had been ship control officer of the watch of the submarine that fired the weapons. But at this moment, it was as if the singularity of the human spirit had bridged the gulf between victor and vanquished.</p> <p>Bonzo then put his hand in his pocket, turned to me, and spoke slowly. \"This\", he said, taking something from his pocket, \"is for you. And I want to make it clear that it is only for you, for no one else, do you understand?\" He then handed me a small ceramic brooch and told me that it was one of a series that had been specially struck for the survivors of the Belgrano. I was truly touched.</p> <p>The meeting was over. We stood up and shook hands and Coco and I turned around and walked out of the cafe without looking back. On October 6, I finally said goodbye to Coco and flew back to my home in St Vincent and the Grenadines. I had been in Argentina for nearly three weeks and had managed to put some ghosts to rest. I realised that Bonzo, Coco, Barcena and all of the others were no different to me. Men who had been doing a job, some well, some not so well. But men with the same humanity, the same pride, the same fears, the same frailties.</p> <p>Eighteen years ago, I should never have believed that one day I would count among my friends a man whom I had helped to send into the frigid waters of the south Atlantic and whose comrades I had helped to send to their deaths. But today I can.</p>",

I told him that I had first seen the ships while on the periscope on May 1, but that they had been detected by HMS Conqueror prior to that first visual sighting.\" Without thinking, I then added: \"And I thought to myself 'What a great target that would make.' \" He nodded and I asked him if his ship had dropped any depth charges on the Conqueror or tried to find the submarine by operating his sonar. \"No,\" he replied, \"we never fired any weapons. What you felt must have been the exploding ammunition and boilers on the Belgrano. You see, we didn't have many weapons on board and we wanted to keep them, maybe for a later engagement. And the sonar - well, it was working but it was a very old and not much good.\" I asked Barcena if his ship had carried Exocet missiles, and he confirmed that it had, but when I asked Coco the same question, whether the Belgrano had carried Exocets, he laughed and told me that the Belgrano's carpenters had fabricated Exocet launchers out of wood, to make it look as if the cruiser carried the missiles. He added that the Belgrano was not even fitted with sonar. \"So what did you do once you realised that the Belgrano had been sunk?\" I asked Barcena. \"We moved away from the area,\" he replied. \"We were worried that the submarine might come back and try to attack us.\" Barcena excused himself and shortly returned with an envelope, which he handed to me. Inside was a photograph of the Hippolito Bouchard, and Barcena had written a moving note, saying that, while we had been enemies 18 years previously, he was happy to have personally met me and wished me all good things for the future. When he left, I said to Coco that I found it surprising that the Hippolito Bouchard had moved so quickly away from the area of the attack and Coco bowed his head and spoke quietly. \"I have often wondered,\" he said, \"why it took 36 hours for us to be rescued.\" A few days later, Coco excitedly announced that he had had a call from Bonzo. He said that he had previously tried to arrange for me to meet the captain of the Belgrano, but that Bonzo had retorted: \"Why would I want to meet a man who tried to kill me?\" A fair enough response, I thought. Now he had called again, to say that he would meet me in a cafe in downtown Buenos Aires. We arrived at the cafe early, and, as the minutes ticked by, Coco nervously tapped his fingers on the table. After a while, he sat up straight and said: \"He is here.\" I turned around and saw a man in a blue anorak walking slowly towards us. His face was grim, and I recognised him from an old photo I had seen. As he reached our table, I stood up and held out my hand. He took it and looked me in the eye. \"It's an honour, sir\", I said in my poor Spanish, \"finally to meet you.\" He simply nodded and sat down next to me. Although they had not met for many years, and although both had been retired from the armed forces for more than a decade and were of the same rank, I noticed that Coco always addressed Bonzo as \"senor\" - \"sir\". From time to time, Bonzo nodded and glanced at me, not in an unfriendly manner, but neither with palpable warmth.The two chatted, and occasionally I heard Bonzo mention my name. The atmosphere was tense, and while I understood snippets of their exchange, much of it eluded me. Bonzo then turned to me and spoke in Spanish. He told me that, in his view, the sinking of the Belgrano had been \"politically criminal\". I nodded and told him that I agreed with him and I felt that he hesitated at that, as if to take another, closer look at me. I asked Coco if it was true that the Belgrano had been steaming home to Argentina and he said that, yes, this was true. In Captain Bonzo's book, \"Los 1,093 Tripulantes\" (The 1,093 crew) Bonzo had suggested that he might, at a later stage, have changed course to the east, back towards the Falkland Islands, but both Coco and Barcena told me that they had been heading west, heading home. Bonzo's hands were unhealthily white with little flesh and tensed knuckles. While age had been kinder to him than to Coco, he nevertheless did not look a well man, and Coco told me that for this meeting, he had made his first unescorted excursion from his apartment in a long time. I felt, as we sat there and talked, that there was no personal animosity against the individuals who had carried out their duty in HMS Conqueror. But it seemed to me that Bonzo, in particular, harboured some resentment over the politics which had led to the sinking in the first place. He struck me as a proud man, a professional naval officer \"of the old school\", and I sensed that he regarded himself as a man who had been terribly wronged. I told both Bonzo and Coco that, for my own part, I felt no remorse at having carried out my duty, but tremendous remorse that that duty had required me to be a party to the sinking of the Belgrano, and I think that they both respected and understood this sentiment. Suddenly, Bonzo looked at me and said, in English: \"So you were born in Scotland? My wife and I were there, many years ago. It is a lovely country,\" and he smiled. The ice had finally been broken and his smile was genuine. Neither Coco nor myself had realised that he could speak English and, by doing so, I felt that he was extending an olive branch. We talked for an hour or so, and neither the Conqueror nor the Belgrano was mentioned again. There seemed to be no need to do so. A retired Argentinian naval captain, \"El Commandante\", as Bonzo is usually referred to, and a retired junior Lieutenant were chatting and drinking coffee in a cafe in Buenos Aires. One had had his ship torpedoed with the loss of 323 members of his crew. The other had been ship control officer of the watch of the submarine that fired the weapons. But at this moment, it was as if the singularity of the human spirit had bridged the gulf between victor and vanquished. Bonzo then put his hand in his pocket, turned to me, and spoke slowly. \"This\", he said, taking something from his pocket, \"is for you. And I want to make it clear that it is only for you, for no one else, do you understand?\" He then handed me a small ceramic brooch and told me that it was one of a series that had been specially struck for the survivors of the Belgrano. I was truly touched. The meeting was over. We stood up and shook hands and Coco and I turned around and walked out of the cafe without looking back. On October 6, I finally said goodbye to Coco and flew back to my home in St Vincent and the Grenadines. I had been in Argentina for nearly three weeks and had managed to put some ghosts to rest. I realised that Bonzo, Coco, Barcena and all of the others were no different to me. Men who had been doing a job, some well, some not so well. But men with the same humanity, the same pride, the same fears, the same frailties. Eighteen years ago, I should never have believed that one day I would count among my friends a man whom I had helped to send into the frigid waters of the south Atlantic and whose comrades I had helped to send to their deaths. But today I can.",

      "bodyText": "US secretary of state Madeleine Albright urged Syrian president Bashar al-Assad today to curb the radical Islamic group Hizbullah, warning that its kidnapping of Israelis was a dangerous provocation. But, as Palestinian militants vowed to continue their violent campaign, a senior US official said that Mrs Albright emerged from the two-and-a-half hour meeting in a Saudi palace without a commitment from Mr Assad. In their first extended encounter, Mr Assad told Mrs Albright that Hezbollah was a largely social organisation that is gaining in influence among ordinary Arabs. Mr Assad also cautioned Mrs Albright that anti-Israeli sentiment was on the rise in the streets of the Arab world and should be taken into account by US policy-makers, said the official, who insisted on remaining anonymous. Hizbullah members kidnapped a 54-year-old reserve Israeli air force colonel on Sunday. The meeting was arranged by Saudi officials, after Mrs Albright briefed them this during efforts to end the violence between Israelis and Palestinians. But sporadic fighting continued today, despite appeals from Israeli and Palestinian leaders to end the violence, responding to a call from US president Bill Clinton at the end of an emergency summit yesterday at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. And Israeli radio reported that Israeli security forces have arrested eight Palestinians suspected of involvement in the mob killing of two Israeli soldiers in the West Bank town of Ramallah last week. Israel's deputy defense minister, Ephraim Sneh, refused comment on the report.. Israel's hardline opposition leader Ariel Sharon has rejected Prime Minister Ehud Barak's call to join an emergency unity government, blaming Israeli concessions at the Sharm el Sheik summit. Mr Sharon said that he could not belong to a coalition that is pursuing a fast-track peace agenda with the Palestinians. It was Mr Sharon's visit to a Jerusalem shrine that is holy to both Muslims and Jews, three weeks ago, which was seen as a provocative power play by Palestinians, that sparked the worst wave of violence in the region in decades. Citing unrest that has led to the deaths of 100 people, nearly all of them Palestinian, Mr Barak had asked Mr Sharon and other opposition leaders to put aside their political differences and unify during the national crisis. But following Tuesday's emergency summit, where the sides agreed to a cease-fire, Mr Sharon said that he was breaking off negotiations for a unity government. He said that the Israeli concessions made there constituted a return to understandings reached at the Camp David peace summit this summer, which he strongly opposed. \"Whoever thinks we will go into a government which has embraced the Camp David path is simply mistaken,\" Mr Sharon told Israel's army radio. We need a different political program.\" Mr Sharon's Likud party advocates negotiating an interim agreement with the Palestinians, to be pursued over an extended period of time. Mr Barak's governing coalition collapsed in July on the eve of Camp David, and the prime minister has few options for political survival short of an emergency government. The opposition senses that there may be early elections and has little interest in keeping Mr Barak afloat. Earlier this month, Hizbullah kidnapped three Israeli soldiers on the Lebanese border. The Israeli government has said that it holds Lebanon, and its patron, Syria, responsible for the kidnappings. Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon. On talks with Israel, Mr Assad follows his late father's line, demanding the return of the Golan Heights and a sliver of land along the Sea of Galilee as the price for peace. Syria lost the strategic border plateau in the 1967 six-day war. Palestinians and Israeli forces traded gunshots in the divided West Bank city of Hebron, in Bethlehem and near Ramallah, where gunmen targeted the Jewish settlement of Psagot. Mrs Albright hopes that Syria will support a ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Palestinians, and soon resume peace talks with Israel. The talks collapsed last January. Mr Assad arrived in Riyadh yesterday and held talks with Saudi crown prince Abdullah on the peace process and violence in Palestinian areas, Saudi officials said. His visit precedes the Arab summit that is due to be held in Egypt on Saturday. Syria's state-run Damascus radio said that it was part of Syria's continued efforts to form a \"strong Arab front\" that could exploit Arab potentials to confront Israel.",

Some 120 Bectu members and \"a handful\" of NUJ members will be balloted by post on the plans, which would see programme producers formally employed on BBC educational programmes scattered into several new departments. Some staff would be shifted into the BBC's Children's department, where they would work across programmes including Blue Peter and the consumer programme Sorted. Others would move into the BBC's new Factual &amp; Learning department to work on documentaries and general factual and leisure programmes, with some redeployed into BBC Drama. A Bectu spokesman said: \"Our concern is that our members will be moved into departments which are already over-staffed, and will be in the firing line if further cuts are made. \"The BBC is saying that the educational programme levels will not decrease, but it is not able to give us a guarantee that staff will be able to work on educational programmes in their new roles. This doesn't seem to stack up.\" Programme makers are also worried about the BBC's stated intention to provide National Curriculum support for teachers, believing that the move will see a pressure for more \"textbook programmes\" and less creative freedom. The deadline for ballot papers to be returned is November 3.",

      "body": "<p>The first person I met at Eden-Olympia was a psychiatrist, and in many ways it seems only too apt that my guide to this 'intelligent' city in the hills above Cannes should have been a specialist in mental disorders. I realize now that a kind of waiting madness, like a state of undeclared war, haunted the office buildings of the business park. For most of us, Dr Wilder Penrose was our amiable Prospero, the psychopomp who steered our darkest dreams towards the daylight. I remember his eager smile when we greeted each other, and the evasive eyes that warned me away from his outstretched hand. Only when I learned to admire this flawed and dangerous man was I able to think of killing him. </p> <p> Rather than fly from London to Nice, a journey as brief as a plastic-tray lunch, Jane and I decided to drive to the Cote d'Azur and steal a few last days of freedom before we committed ourselves to Eden-Olympia and the disciplines of the Euro-corporate lifestyle. Jane was still unsure about her six-month secondment to the business park's private clinic. Her predecessor, a young English doctor named David Greenwood, had met a tragic and still unexplained death after running amok with a rifle. By chance, Jane had known Greenwood when they worked together at Guy's Hospital, and I often thought of the boyishly handsome doctor who could rouse an entire women's ward with a single smile. </p> <p> Memories of Greenwood were waiting for us at Boulogne as the Jaguar left the cross-Channel ferry and rolled its wheels across the quayside. Going into a tabac for a packet of Gitanes - illicit cigarettes had kept both of us sane during my months in hospital - Jane bought a copy of Paris Match and found Greenwood's face on the cover, under a headline that referred to the unsolved mystery. As she sat alone on the Jaguar's bonnet, staring at the graphic photographs of murder victims and the grainy maps of the death route, I realized that my spunky but insecure young wife needed to put a few more miles between herself and Eden-Olympia. </p> <p> Rather than overheat either Jane's imagination or the Jaguar's elderly engine, I decided to avoid the Autoroute du Soleil and take the RN7. We bypassed Paris on the P\u00e9riph\u00e9rique, and spent our first evening at a venerable hotel in the forest near Fontainebleau, spelling out the attractions of Eden-Olympia to each other and trying not to notice the antique hunting rifle on the dining-room mantelpiece. </p> <p> The next day we crossed the olive line, following the long, cicada miles that my mother and father had motored when they first took me to the Mediterranean as a boy. Surprisingly, many of the old landmarks were still there, the family restaurants and literate bookshops, and the light airfields with their casually parked planes that had first made me decide to become a pilot. </p> <p> Trying to distract Jane, I talked far too much. During the few months of our marriage I had told my doctor-bride almost nothing about myself, and the drive became a mobile autobiography that unwound my earlier life along with the kilometres of dust, insects and sun. My parents had been dead for two decades, but I wanted Jane to meet them, my hard-drinking, womanizing father, a provincial-circuit barrister, and my lonely, daydreaming mother, always getting over yet another doomed affair. </p> <p> At a hotel in Hauterives, south of Lyons, Jane and I sat in the same high-ceilinged breakfast room, unchanged after thirty-five years, where the stags' heads still gazed over shelves stocked with the least enticing alcohol I had ever seen. My parents, after their usual bickering breakfast of croissants and coffee helped down by slugs of cognac, had dragged me off to the dream palace of the Facteur Cheval, a magical edifice conjured out of pebbles the old postman collected on his rounds. Working tirelessly for thirty years, he created an heroic doll's house that expressed his simple but dignified dreams of the earthly paradise. My mother tipsily climbed the miniature stairs, listening to my father declaim the postman's naive verses in his resonant baritone. All I could think of, with a ten-year-old's curiosity about my parents' sex-lives, was what had passed between them during the night. Now, as I embraced Jane on the parapets of the dream palace, I realized that I would never know. </p> <p> Cheval might have survived, but the France of the 1960s, with its Routier lunches, anti-CRS slogans and the Citroen DS, had been largely replaced by a new France of high-speed monorails, MacDo's, and the lavish air-shows that my cousin Charles and I would visit in our rented Cessna when we founded our firm of aviation publishers. And Eden-Olympia was the newest of the new France. Ten miles to the north-east of Cannes, in the wooded hills between Valbonne and the coast, it was the latest of the development zones that had begun with Sophia-Antipolis and would soon turn Provence into Europe's silicon valley. </p> <p> Lured by tax concessions and a climate like northern California's, dozens of multinational companies had moved into the business park that now employed over ten thousand people. The senior managements were the most highly paid professional caste in Europe, a new elite of administrators, enarques and scientific entrepreneurs. The lavish brochure enthused over a vision of glass and titanium straight from the drawing boards of Richard Neutra and Frank Gehry, but softened by landscaped parks and artificial lakes, a humane version of Corbusier's radiant city. Even my sceptical eye was prepared to blink. </p> <p> Studying the maps, I propped the brochure on my knee-brace as Jane steered the Jaguar through the afternoon traffic on the Grasse road. The stench of raw perfume from a nearby factory filled the car, but Jane wound down her window and inhaled deeply. Our disreputable evening in Arles had revived her, swaying arm in arm with me after a drunken dinner, exploring what I insisted was Van Gogh's canal but turned out to be a stagnant storm-drain behind the archbishop's palace. We had both been eager to get back to our hotel and the well-upholstered bed. </p> <p> The colour was returning to her face, for almost the first time since our wedding. Her watchful eyes and toneless skin were like those of an over-gifted child. Before meeting me, Jane had spent too many hours in elevators and pathology rooms, and the pallor of strip lighting haunted her like a twelve-year-old's memories of a bad dream. But once we left Arles she rose to the challenge of Eden-Olympia, and I could hear her muttering to herself, rehearsing the risqu\u00e9 backchat that so intrigued the younger consultants at Guy's. </p> <p> 'Cheer me up, Paul. How much further?' </p> <p> 'The last mile - always the shortest one. You must be tired.' </p> <p> 'It's been a lot of fun, more than I thought. Why do I feel so nervous?' </p> <p> 'You don't.' </p> <p>I pressed her hand against the wheel, steering the Jaguar around an elderly woman cyclist, panniers filled with baguettes. </p> <p>'Jane, you'll be a huge success. You're the youngest doctor on the staff, and the prettiest. You're efficient, hardworking.... what else?' </p> <p> 'Slightly insolent?' </p> <p> 'You'll do them good. Anyway, it's only a business park.' </p> <p> 'I can see it - straight ahead. My God, it's the size of Florida...' </p> <p> The first office buildings in the Eden-Olympia complex were emerging from the slopes of a long valley filled with eucalyptus trees and umbrella pines. Beyond them were the rooftops of Cannes and the Iles de L\u00e9rins, a glimpse of the Mediterranean that never failed to lift my heart. </p> <p> 'Paul, down there...' </p> <p>Jane pointed to the hillside, raising a finger still grimy from changing a spark plug. Hundreds of blue ovals trembled like damaged retinas in the Provencal sun. </p> <p>'What are they - rain-traps? Tanks full of Chanel Number 5? And those people. They seem to be naked.' </p> <p> 'They are naked. Or nearly. Swimming pools, Jane. Take a good look at your new patients.' </p> <p>I watched one senior executive in the garden of his villa, a suntanned man in his fifties with a slim, almost adolescent body, springing lightly on his diving board. </p> <p>'A healthy crowd.... I can't imagine anyone here actually bothering to fall ill.' </p> <p> 'Don't be too sure. I'll be busier than you think. The place is probably riddled with airport TB and the kind of viruses that only breed in executive jets. And as for their minds...' </p> <p> I began to count the pools, each a flare of turquoise light lost behind the high walls of the villas with their screens of cycads and bougainvillaea. Ten thousand years in the future, long after the Cote d'Azur had been abandoned, the first explorers would puzzle over these empty pits, with their eroded frescoes of tritons and stylized fish, inexplicably hauled up the mountainsides like aquatic sundials or the altars of a bizarre religion devised by a race of visionary geometers. </p> <p> We left the Cannes road and turned onto a landscaped avenue that led towards the gates of the business park. The noise from the Jaguar's tyres fell away as they rolled across a more expensive surface material - milled ivory, at the very least - that would soothe the stressed wheels of the stretch limousines. A palisade of Canary palms formed an honour guard along the verges, while beds of golden cannas flamed from the central reservation. </p> <p> Despite this gaudy welcome, wealth at Eden-Olympia displayed the old-money discretion that the mercantile rich of the information age had decided to observe at the start of a new millennium. The glass and gun-metal office blocks were set well apart from each other, separated by artificial lakes and forested traffic islands where a latter-day Crusoe could have found comfortable refuge. The faint mist over the lakes and the warm sun reflected from the glass curtain-walling seemed to generate an opal haze, as if the entire business park were a mirage, a virtual city conjured into the pine-scented air like a son-et-lumiere vision of a new Versailles. </p> <p> But work and the realities of corporate life anchored Eden-Olympia to the ground. The buildings wore their ventilation shafts and cable conduits on their external walls, an open reminder of Eden-Olympia's dedication to company profits and the approval of its shareholders. The satellite dishes on the roofs resembled the wimples of an order of computer-literate nuns, committed to the sanctity of the workstation and the pieties of the spreadsheet. </p> <p> Gravel tore at the Jaguar's tyres. Waking from her reverie, Jane braked sharply before we reached the gatehouse, sending the old sports saloon into a giddy shunt. Two uniformed guards looked up from their electronic screens, but Jane ignored them, readying a two-finger salute that I managed to conceal. </p> <p> 'Jane, they're on our side.' </p> <p> 'Sorry, Paul. I know, we want them to like me. Open your window.' She grimaced at herself in the rear-view mirror. 'That cheap perfume. I smell like a tart...' </p> <p>'The most gorgeous tart on the Cote d'Azur. They're lucky to have you.' </p> <p>I tried to settle her hands as she fretted over her lipstick, obsessively fine-tuning herself. I could feel the perspiration on her wrists, brought out by more than the August sun. </p> <p>'Jane, we don't have to be here. Even now, you can change your mind. We can drive away, cross the border into Italy, spend a week in San Remo...' </p> <p> 'Paul? I'm not your daughter.' </p> <p>Jane frowned at me, as if I were an intruder into her world, then touched my cheek forgivingly. </p> <p>'I signed a six-month contract. Since David died they've had recruitment problems. They need me...' </p> <p> I watched Jane make a conscious effort to relax, treating herself like an overwrought patient in casualty. She lay against the worn leather seating, breathing the bright air into her lungs and slowly exhaling. She patted the dark bang that hid her bold forehead and always sprang forward like a coxcomb at the first hint of stress. I remembered the calm and sensible way in which she had helped the trainee nurses who fumbled with my knee-brace. At heart she was the subversive schoolgirl, the awkward-squad recruiter with a primed grenade in her locker, who saw through the stuffy conventions of boarding school and teaching hospital but was always kind enough to rescue a flustered housekeeper or ward orderly. </p> <p> Now, at Eden-Olympia, it was her turn to be intimidated by the ultra-cerebral French physicians who would soon be her colleagues. She sat forward, chin raised, fingers drumming a threatening tattoo on the steering wheel. Satisfied that she could hold her own, she noticed me massaging my knee. </p> <p> 'Paul, that awful brace... we'll get it off in a few days. You've been in agony and never complained.' </p> <p> 'I'm sorry I couldn't help with the driving. Cannes is a long way from Maida Vale.' </p> <p> 'Everywhere is a long way from Maida Vale. I'm glad we came.' </p> <p>She gazed at the office buildings that climbed the valley slopes, and at the satellite dishes distilling their streams of information from the sky. </p> <p>'It all looks very civilized, in a Euro kind of way. Not a drifting leaf in sight. It's hard to believe anyone would be allowed to go mad here. Poor David...'</p> <p> David Greenwood's death dominated our time at Eden-Olympia, hovering above the artificial lakes and forests like the ghosts of Princip over Sarajevo and Lee Harvey Oswald over Dallas. Why this dedicated children's doctor should have left his villa on a morning in late May and set out on a murder rampage had never been explained. He had killed seven senior executives at Eden-Olympia, executed his three hostages and then turned his rifle on himself. He had written no suicide note, no defiant last message, and as the police marksmen closed in he had calmly abandoned himself to death. </p> <p> A week before our wedding, Jane and I had met him at a London reception for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. Likeable but a little naive, Greenwood reminded me of an enthusiastic Baptist missionary, telling Jane about the superb facilities at the Eden-Olympia clinic, and the refuge for orphaned children he had set up at La Bocca, the industrial suburb to the west of Cannes. With his uncombed hair and raised eyebrows, he looked as if he had just received an unexpected shock, a revelation of all the injustices in the world, which he had decided to put right. Yet he was no prude, and talked about his six months in Bangladesh, comparing the caste rivalries among the village prostitutes with the status battles of the women executives at Eden-Olympia. </p> <p> Jane had known him during their internships at Guy's, and often met him after she enrolled with the overseas supply agency that recruited Greenwood to Eden-Olympia. When she first applied for the paediatric vacancy, I had been against her going, remembering her shock on hearing the news of Greenwood's violent death. Although she was off-duty for the day, she had taken a white coat from the wardrobe in our bedroom and buttoned it over her nightdress as she laid the newspapers across my knees. </p> <p> The entire London press made the tragedy its main story. 'Nightmare in Eden' was the repeated headline above photographs of Riviera beaches and bullet-starred doors in the offices of the murdered executives. Jane hardly spoke about Greenwood, but insisted on watching the television coverage of French police holding back the sightseers who invaded Eden-Olympia. Blood-drenched secretaries, too speechless to explain to the cameras how their bosses had been executed, stumbled towards the waiting ambulances, while helicopters ferried the wounded to hospitals in Grasse and Cannes. </p> <p> The investigating magistrate, Judge Michel Terneau, led the inquiry, reconstructing the murders and taking evidence from a host of witnesses, but came up with no convincing explanation. Greenwood's colleagues at the clinic testified to his earnest and intense disposition. An editorial in Le Monde speculated that the contrast between the worldly power of Eden-Olympia and the deprived lives of the Arab immigrants in Cannes La Bocca had driven Greenwood into a frenzy of frustration, a blind rage at inequalities between the first and third worlds. The murders were part political manifesto, so the newspaper believed, and part existential scream. </p> <p> When the case at last left the headlines Jane never referred to Greenwood again. But when the vacancy was advertised she immediately called the manager of the supply agency. She was the only applicant, and quickly convinced me that a long break in the Mediterranean would do wonders for my knee, injured in a flying accident nine months earlier and still refusing to mend. My cousin Charles agreed to take over the publishing house while I was away, and would e-mail me copy and proof pages of the two aviation magazines that I edited. </p> <p> Eager to help Jane's career, I was happy to go. At the same time, like any husband from a different generation, I was curious about my young wife's romantic past. Had she and Greenwood once been lovers? The question was not entirely prurient. A mass-murderer had perhaps held her in his arms, and as Jane embraced me the spirit of his death embraced me too. The widows of assassins were forever their armourers. </p> <p> On our last night in Maida Vale, lying in bed with our packed suitcases in the hall, I asked Jane how closely she had known Greenwood. She was sitting astride me, with the expression of a serious-minded adolescent on her face that she always wore when making love. She drew herself upright, a hand raised to hit me, then solemnly told me that she and Greenwood had never been more than friends. I almost believed her. But some unstated loyalty to Greenwood's memory followed us from Boulogne to the gates of Eden-Olympia. </p> <p> Baring her teeth, Jane started the engine. </p> <p>'Right... let's take them on. Find the clinic on the map. Someone called Penrose will meet us there. Why they've picked a psychiatrist, I don't know. I told them you hate the entire profession. Apparently, he was hurt in David's shoot-out, so be gentle with him...' </p> <p> She steered the Jaguar towards the gatehouse, where the guards had already lost interest in their screens, intrigued by this confident young woman at the controls of her antique car. </p> <p> While they checked our documents and rang the clinic I stared at the nearby office buildings and tried to imagine Greenwood's last desperate hours. He had shot dead one of his colleagues at the clinic. A second physician, a senior surgeon, had suffered a fatal heart attack the next day. A third colleague had been wounded in the arm: Dr Wilder Penrose, the psychiatrist who was about to introduce us to our new Eden.</p>",

Jane frowned at me, as if I were an intruder into her world, then touched my cheek forgivingly. 'I signed a six-month contract. Since David died they've had recruitment problems. They need me...' I watched Jane make a conscious effort to relax, treating herself like an overwrought patient in casualty. She lay against the worn leather seating, breathing the bright air into her lungs and slowly exhaling. She patted the dark bang that hid her bold forehead and always sprang forward like a coxcomb at the first hint of stress. I remembered the calm and sensible way in which she had helped the trainee nurses who fumbled with my knee-brace. At heart she was the subversive schoolgirl, the awkward-squad recruiter with a primed grenade in her locker, who saw through the stuffy conventions of boarding school and teaching hospital but was always kind enough to rescue a flustered housekeeper or ward orderly. Now, at Eden-Olympia, it was her turn to be intimidated by the ultra-cerebral French physicians who would soon be her colleagues. She sat forward, chin raised, fingers drumming a threatening tattoo on the steering wheel. Satisfied that she could hold her own, she noticed me massaging my knee. 'Paul, that awful brace... we'll get it off in a few days. You've been in agony and never complained.' 'I'm sorry I couldn't help with the driving. Cannes is a long way from Maida Vale.' 'Everywhere is a long way from Maida Vale. I'm glad we came.' She gazed at the office buildings that climbed the valley slopes, and at the satellite dishes distilling their streams of information from the sky. 'It all looks very civilized, in a Euro kind of way. Not a drifting leaf in sight. It's hard to believe anyone would be allowed to go mad here. Poor David...' David Greenwood's death dominated our time at Eden-Olympia, hovering above the artificial lakes and forests like the ghosts of Princip over Sarajevo and Lee Harvey Oswald over Dallas. Why this dedicated children's doctor should have left his villa on a morning in late May and set out on a murder rampage had never been explained. He had killed seven senior executives at Eden-Olympia, executed his three hostages and then turned his rifle on himself. He had written no suicide note, no defiant last message, and as the police marksmen closed in he had calmly abandoned himself to death. A week before our wedding, Jane and I had met him at a London reception for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. Likeable but a little naive, Greenwood reminded me of an enthusiastic Baptist missionary, telling Jane about the superb facilities at the Eden-Olympia clinic, and the refuge for orphaned children he had set up at La Bocca, the industrial suburb to the west of Cannes. With his uncombed hair and raised eyebrows, he looked as if he had just received an unexpected shock, a revelation of all the injustices in the world, which he had decided to put right. Yet he was no prude, and talked about his six months in Bangladesh, comparing the caste rivalries among the village prostitutes with the status battles of the women executives at Eden-Olympia. Jane had known him during their internships at Guy's, and often met him after she enrolled with the overseas supply agency that recruited Greenwood to Eden-Olympia. When she first applied for the paediatric vacancy, I had been against her going, remembering her shock on hearing the news of Greenwood's violent death. Although she was off-duty for the day, she had taken a white coat from the wardrobe in our bedroom and buttoned it over her nightdress as she laid the newspapers across my knees. The entire London press made the tragedy its main story. 'Nightmare in Eden' was the repeated headline above photographs of Riviera beaches and bullet-starred doors in the offices of the murdered executives. Jane hardly spoke about Greenwood, but insisted on watching the television coverage of French police holding back the sightseers who invaded Eden-Olympia. Blood-drenched secretaries, too speechless to explain to the cameras how their bosses had been executed, stumbled towards the waiting ambulances, while helicopters ferried the wounded to hospitals in Grasse and Cannes. The investigating magistrate, Judge Michel Terneau, led the inquiry, reconstructing the murders and taking evidence from a host of witnesses, but came up with no convincing explanation. Greenwood's colleagues at the clinic testified to his earnest and intense disposition. An editorial in Le Monde speculated that the contrast between the worldly power of Eden-Olympia and the deprived lives of the Arab immigrants in Cannes La Bocca had driven Greenwood into a frenzy of frustration, a blind rage at inequalities between the first and third worlds. The murders were part political manifesto, so the newspaper believed, and part existential scream. When the case at last left the headlines Jane never referred to Greenwood again. But when the vacancy was advertised she immediately called the manager of the supply agency. She was the only applicant, and quickly convinced me that a long break in the Mediterranean would do wonders for my knee, injured in a flying accident nine months earlier and still refusing to mend. My cousin Charles agreed to take over the publishing house while I was away, and would e-mail me copy and proof pages of the two aviation magazines that I edited. Eager to help Jane's career, I was happy to go. At the same time, like any husband from a different generation, I was curious about my young wife's romantic past. Had she and Greenwood once been lovers? The question was not entirely prurient. A mass-murderer had perhaps held her in his arms, and as Jane embraced me the spirit of his death embraced me too. The widows of assassins were forever their armourers. On our last night in Maida Vale, lying in bed with our packed suitcases in the hall, I asked Jane how closely she had known Greenwood. She was sitting astride me, with the expression of a serious-minded adolescent on her face that she always wore when making love. She drew herself upright, a hand raised to hit me, then solemnly told me that she and Greenwood had never been more than friends. I almost believed her. But some unstated loyalty to Greenwood's memory followed us from Boulogne to the gates of Eden-Olympia. Baring her teeth, Jane started the engine. 'Right... let's take them on. Find the clinic on the map. Someone called Penrose will meet us there. Why they've picked a psychiatrist, I don't know. I told them you hate the entire profession. Apparently, he was hurt in David's shoot-out, so be gentle with him...' She steered the Jaguar towards the gatehouse, where the guards had already lost interest in their screens, intrigued by this confident young woman at the controls of her antique car. While they checked our documents and rang the clinic I stared at the nearby office buildings and tried to imagine Greenwood's last desperate hours. He had shot dead one of his colleagues at the clinic. A second physician, a senior surgeon, had suffered a fatal heart attack the next day. A third colleague had been wounded in the arm: Dr Wilder Penrose, the psychiatrist who was about to introduce us to our new Eden.",

I talked with some of the other Lazio players and I asked them what they thought of that. They said they know him and he is stupid. They were sorry, they apologised.\" The abuse was not restricted to Mihajlovic however, as the Arsenal squad were pelted with plastic bottles from the crowd at the end of the game. Vieira claims the experience means he will never consider a return to club football in Italy. \"I know that there are a lot of Italian clubs who would like to sign me but I don't want to play in Serie A\", he said. \"I can't stand the racist atmosphere that you can almost breath here.\" Lazio have built up a reputation for extreme support, and were in trouble only last season when fans began carrying banners declaring their allegiance with Mussolini and the Serbian warlord Arkan. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "The safety of Britain's rail system has been thrown into question yet again after the third serious accident in three years left four people dead and 33 injured yesterday. The tragedy happened shortly after midday yesterday when a high-speed train derailed and broke up at more than 100mph, hurling some passengers onto the track. The cause of the crash is still being investigated but police ruled out terrorism as the cause last night despite receiving a bomb threat just two days ago. Railtrack has launched a full investigation and safety experts are concentrating on whether a section of axle could have failed as the train reached speeds of 115mph. Another possibility is that the track may have contributed to the horrific crash, either due to vandalism or a fault on the line. Many expressed a sense of disbelief that the death toll had not been higher. The train literally came apart as it took a right-hand bend on one of the busiest stretches of line in Britain. The timing of the accident has jarred emotions; it comes less than two weeks after the first anniversary of the Ladbroke Grove crash at Paddington. The 12.10pm GNER London King's Cross to Leeds service left the track near Hatfield, Hertfordshire, barely 20 minutes into its journey. The train split in two and a giant hole was torn in the buffet car. Some passengers reported that a loud bang was heard seconds before the carriages skewed off the track. Three ended up on their side, with four others derailed. The dead and most severely injured came from the middle section of the train. Two first-class carriages and the rear locomotive separated from the main section of the train and screeched to a halt; the buffet car, six standard class coaches and the front locomotive careered a few hundred yards further up the track. The buffet car then toppled over and smashed into a trackside pylon which tore off its roof. Of the 200 passengers on board the train, four were pronounced dead at the scene and 33 were taken to local hospitals. Witnesses described scenes of \"mayhem\", with bodies by the track and people weeping. Most of the casualties - 14 women and 12 men - were taken to the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in Welwyn Garden City, with the Lister hospital in Stevenage taking seven. In June 1998, another high-speed GNER train derailed on the same track just 20 miles away, injuring nine people, the Health and Safety Executive said. Chris Garnett, the chief executive of GNER, said the train, built in 1990, would have been serviced every night and there was nothing in its records which indicated any problems. He would not be drawn on suggestions that two years ago another GNER train suffered a broken wheel, reportedly because of metal fatigue. GNER was fined in that case. At the scene of yesterday's disaster a set of wheels, called bogeys, had come off a carriage that was left resting in bushes 100 yards away from the front section of the train. Mr Garnett said: \"We are investigating all the reasons, we do not know the cause. The problem we did have with the broken wheel was fully investigated and all repairs carried out, we don't believe it is that [the cause] but I keep saying, we do not know the cause of the accident at this stage.\" Nick Pollard from Railtrack, which is responsible for maintaining the tracks, said: \"The track is patrolled on a very regular basis, no less than on a weekly basis.

The transport minister, Lord MacDonald, visited the scene within hours of the disaster, and expressed his sympathies to the relatives of the dead and the injured. He said that the railway inspectorate were carrying out an investigation into the causes of the disaster. He praised the emergency services and said that his thoughts were with the families of those who had died. He has also asked the HSE to provide an \"urgent\" report on the crash.

Daily Variety reports that the movie, in which Will Smith plays the enigmatic heavyweight world champion, found itself in difficulties when Mann could not guarantee that the film would be produced for the agreed price tag of $100m. The Los Angeles Times suggests that the 57-year-old director failed to convince studio heads that he could pull off the movie without going at least $5m over. Mann, meanwhile, angered that Columbia gave the go-ahead on the film, is threatening to withdraw from the troubled production. The director reportedly offered to cut some expensive locations, and Mann, Smith and producer Jon Peters have all agreed to take \"substantial cuts\" in their upfront fees, the Times reports.

      "body": "<p>A few final chores and one choice job - test-driving a mini-jetpack - awaited a pair of astronauts Wednesday, the last of four days of spacewalks around the international space station. </p> <p>On their second trip outside space shuttle Discovery since Monday, spacewalkers Michael Lopez-Alegria and Jeff Wisoff had to clean up the top of the newly installed station truss for the arrival of a 240-foot pair of solar wings in December. </p> <p>The duo also had to deploy a tray on the truss that will hold connections between the station and the US Destiny laboratory module, scheduled for installation in January. But with that work out of the way, the spacewalkers were to fire up a mini-jetpack they had only experienced via endless practice in Nasa's virtual reality laboratory. </p> <p>Lopez-Alegria and Wisoff were enthusiastic about the tests well before launch. </p> <p>\"They want to do it and we want them to do it,\" said Daryl Schuck, the lead spacewalk officer in Mission Control. First, the duo had to attempt a few jetpack maneuvers about 40 feet above Discovery - 240 miles above Earth. </p> <p>Then, one at a time, they were to jet down to the rear of the cargo bay while one followed alongside on the end of the shuttle robot arm holding a tether - just in case. Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata was tasked with controlling the robot arm from inside Discovery.</p> <p>Flight director Chuck Shaw said the 50-foot trips, which were supposed to take about three minutes apiece, would be \"a little like watching paint dry.\" </p> <p>The rescue jetpack is not nearly the hot rod it would seem.

      "bodyText": "A few final chores and one choice job - test-driving a mini-jetpack - awaited a pair of astronauts Wednesday, the last of four days of spacewalks around the international space station. On their second trip outside space shuttle Discovery since Monday, spacewalkers Michael Lopez-Alegria and Jeff Wisoff had to clean up the top of the newly installed station truss for the arrival of a 240-foot pair of solar wings in December. The duo also had to deploy a tray on the truss that will hold connections between the station and the US Destiny laboratory module, scheduled for installation in January. But with that work out of the way, the spacewalkers were to fire up a mini-jetpack they had only experienced via endless practice in Nasa's virtual reality laboratory. Lopez-Alegria and Wisoff were enthusiastic about the tests well before launch. \"They want to do it and we want them to do it,\" said Daryl Schuck, the lead spacewalk officer in Mission Control. First, the duo had to attempt a few jetpack maneuvers about 40 feet above Discovery - 240 miles above Earth. Then, one at a time, they were to jet down to the rear of the cargo bay while one followed alongside on the end of the shuttle robot arm holding a tether - just in case. Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata was tasked with controlling the robot arm from inside Discovery. Flight director Chuck Shaw said the 50-foot trips, which were supposed to take about three minutes apiece, would be \"a little like watching paint dry.\" The rescue jetpack is not nearly the hot rod it would seem. Since it's built only to bring an errant astronaut back to the shuttle or the space station, each move has to be deliberate to conserve its limited fuel. Earlier astronauts have flown on a bigger jetpack designed for zooming around space, but Nasa stopped using those in the 1980s. In keeping with the rescue theme, Wisoff and Lopez-Alegria also planned to take turns acting as space lifeguards. One was to feign injury while the other carried him to safety, so Nasa could see how astronauts would handle an injured or incapacitated spacewalker. Discovery's other spacewalkers, Leroy Chiao and Bill McArthur, ventured outside for their second spacewalk of the mission Tuesday. They mounted two power converters on the truss and connected a few cables. Their spacewalk lasted about 17 minutes beyond its scheduled 6 1/2 hours. \"That might be attributed to Bill and Leroy's reluctance to come inside. They did make some comments about that,\" Schuck said. \"I really don't think that was a factor but I guess I can't blame them.\" At the close of Wisoff and Lopez-Alegria's spacewalk, their second of the mission, all that remains for Discovery's crew is a day inside the space station tending to various tasks. They'll pull away from the station Friday, leaving behind 10 tons of new space station pieces.

      "body": "<p>In the late 1940s, Somerset Maugham, still at the height of his fame, was prevailed upon by the film producer Antony Darnborough, who has died aged 86, to travel from the south of France to Pinewood studios to introduce, on film, four of his stories in Quartet (1948). It was a real coup for Darnborough, a hands-on operator conscious of the need for British films to make money in the United States - and aware that Maugham was even more popular in the US than in England.</p> <p>Darnborough went to great lengths to reproduce Maugham's study in the studio, even duplicating his favourite chair with worn patches on the arms. The 74-year-old author was so impressed with the rejuvenating effect of his make-up that he told Darnborough: \"I would wear it all the time if it were not for the possibility that people might get the wrong impression.\"</p> <p>Darnborough had the largest say in the selection of the stories, which were four of Maugham's most celebrated: The Facts Of Life, The Alien Corn, The Colonel's Lady and The Kite, each contrasted in mood, pace and rhythm, and each directed by a different director (Ken Annakin, Harold French, Ralph Smart and Arthur Crabtree), with superb casts that included Cecil Parker, Nora Swinburne, Dirk Bogarde, George Cole, Mai Zetterling, Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne.</p> <p>Quartet was a box-office hit, and Maugham was easily persuaded by Darnborough to return to do Trio (1950) and Encore (1951). The former was made up of The Verger, Mr Knowall and Sanatorium, while the latter consisted of The Ant And The Grasshopper, Winter Cruise and Gigolo And Gigolette. Again, excellent direction and fine casts - Nigel Patrick, Jean Simmons, James Hayter, Michael Rennie and Glynis Johns (to whom Darnborough was briefly engaged) - provided excellent entertainment.</p> <p>Those three omnibus films were Darnborough's greatest successes in a career as a feature-film producer that ran from 1947 to 1956.</p> <p>Darnborough was born in Weybridge, the son of wealthy parents. On leaving boarding school in St Albans, family connections got him a job as a Daily Mail gossip columnist, before wartime service in the Royal Artillery, during which he won a military cross.</p> <p>After the war, with the help of his brother-in-law, the film conductor and composer Muir Mathieson, Darnborough became production manager for Sydney Box at Gainsborough studios. His first film as producer was The Calendar (1947), a good Edgar Wallace racetrack melodrama, which was followed by My Brother's Keeper (1948), an effective piece about two escaping convicts, Jack Warner and George Cole, handcuffed together. Shot on location, it had a fresh- ness which suggested a new sense of direction in British cinema.</p> <p>Boys In Brown (1949), another realist film about criminals, now seems rather preachy and meek. The over-age borstal boys included whining Richard Attenborough, decent Jimmy Hanley, cocky Michael Medwin, and troublemaker Dirk Bogarde, with Jack Warner as their humane governor.

      "body": "<p><strong>Australia</strong></p> <p>Michael Slater gave the Australian one-day selectors selectors a sharp elbow in the ribs as New South Wales crushed neighbours Victoria in the Mercantile Mutual Cup at the North Sydney Oval. He hit 61, including 18 off an over from Shane Warne, as NSW raced to their target of 194 with more than 14 overs to spare. Under new laws this season, NSW became the first side to pick up a bonus point for scoring at least 1.25 times as quickly as their opponents.</p> <p>Because of Australia's unexpected early departure from the ICC Knockout Trophy in Kenya, both teams had the luxury of fielding all their international players. But when Steve Waugh won the toss and asked Victoria to bat it was one of their lesser names that did the damage. Nathan Bracken, a 23-year-old left-arm seamer, took 4-36 as Victoria stumbled to 193. There were two wickets each for Shane Lee (2-33) and Stuart MacGill (2-40) but none for the international new-ball duo of Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee.</p> <p>NSW began explosively in reply. Brad Haddin creamed 69 off just 52 balls and added 109 for the first wicket with Slater. Warne, on his comeback after undergoing shoulder surgery, conceded 47 runs from six wicketless overs and was swiftly removed from the attack. Steve Waugh and Michael Bevan wrapped up the match in style.</p> <p><strong>Victoria</strong> 193 in 48.5 overs (BJ Hodge 87)<br> *<strong>New South Wales</strong> 197-2 in 35.5 overs<br> <strong>New South Wales won by 8 wickets</strong></p> <p> South Australia recorded their first win of the season when they beat Tasmania in a thrilling rain-affected match in Adelaide. Set 249 to win, Tasmania were on course while Ricky Ponting (68) and Michael Di Venuto (124) were adding 137 for the second wicket. And Di Venuto was still there with 10 needed off the last five balls. But he was brilliantly run out by the South Australian wicketkeeper Graham Manou, before Jason Gillespie bowled Dene Hills for 1 with a ball to go. Damien Wright needed to hit a six off the final ball to force a tie, but could manage just two. </p> <p>Earlier, SA made 248-6 off their 43 overs, with solid contributions from all the top order, although they were helped by some wayward bowling from the Tasmanians, who conceded 32 extras, including 23 in wides and no-balls. Gerard Denton, in his first match after a year's lay-off due to a back injury, conceded 40 off just three overs.</p> <p> <strong>South Australia</strong> 248-6 in 43 overs (JM Vaughan 57, CJ Davies 54)<br> *<strong>Tasmania</strong> 244-5 in 43 overs<br> <strong>South Australia won by 4 runs</strong></p> <p> In the first-class Pura Cup, Queensland looked to be off to a flying start as they ran up 442 in their first innings against Western Australia at Perth, thanks mainly to 175 from Jimmy Maher and 128 from Stuart Law. The situation looked even brighter when they bowled WA out for 195 (Adam Dale 5-41) enforced the follow-on and then reduced them to 43/3 in their second innings.</p> <p>It all started to go wrong after that, though, as a lifeless pitch and some uninspired bowling allowed Damien Martyn to dig in for 78, before an unbeaten sixth-wicket partnership of 166 between Durham's Simon Katich and Adam Gilchrist spared the Western Australian blushes. Katich's gritty 105 not out took nearly eight hours, while Gilchrist's unbeaten 109, including 15 fours, was more aggressive. He smashed Dale for four fours in succession, then hit him for three more in a row in Dale's next over. </p> <p><strong>Queensland </strong>442<br> *<strong>Western Australia</strong>195 and 349-5<br> <strong>Match drawn</strong><br> <strong>Queensland win on first-innings lead</strong><br> <strong>Queensland 2pts, Western Australia 0</strong></p> <p> <strong>India</strong></p> <p>The Rest of India thrashed Mumbai by 10 wickets as the Indian season got under way with its traditional curtain-raiser, the Irani Trophy. Mumbai, who were playing because they won last year's Ranji Trophy, started slowly in their first innings, but 56 from Wasim Jaffer, plus a late flurry by Ramesh Powar (40) and a last-wicket stand of 42 between Nulesh Kulkarni (14*) and Santosh Saxena (27) edged them towards a respectable 260. Offspinner Sharandeep Singh (4-55) and slow left-armer Murali Kartik (4-73) were the best of the Rest. The Rest's first innings was tottering at 29-3 before VVS Laxman took over - he stroked his way to 167 with impeccable timing, taking few risks along the way, and was backed up by Mohammed Kaif (75), with whom he shared a fourth-wicket stand of 201, and Jacob Martin (51).</p> <p>History beckoned in the Mumbai second innings, as Kartik picked up the first nine wickets in a bid to become only the fifth Indian to take all ten in a first-class game. It was not to be, though, as Singh snapped up the wicket of No. 11 Santosh Saxena for a first-ball duck. There was some consolation for Kartik as his figures of 9-70, coming off an unchanged spell of 24 overs, were a new record for the Irani Trophy. It gave him match figures of 13-143. The Rest, needing only 56 to win, quickly polished them off without loss to retain the trophy.</p> <p>*<strong>Mumbai</strong> 260 and 184<br> <strong>Rest of India</strong> 389 and 58-0<br> <strong>Rest of India won by 10 wickets</strong></p> <p> <strong>Pakistan</strong></p> <p>There were runs aplenty in the opening round of matches in the first-class Quaid-e- Azam Trophy first division, with no fewer than 10 centuries in the six matches. There were big wins for Sargodha, who beat Sheikhupura, and Faisalabad, who defeated Gujranwala. And, in two high-scoring matches, Lahore Blues beat Lahore, while Karachi overturned Karachi Blues, the highlight of the match being scores of 100* and 50* for Hasan Raza, who made his Test debut four years ago at the alleged age of 14.

In reply Kwa-Zulu Natal collapsed against the new-ball pairing of Kenny Benjamin, the former West Indian Test player, and Andre Nel, who each took 3-25 from 9 overs. The total of 153 could have been a lot worse had it not been for a last-wicket stand of 50 between Kyle Bender and Gary Gilder.

      "bodyText": "Australia Michael Slater gave the Australian one-day selectors selectors a sharp elbow in the ribs as New South Wales crushed neighbours Victoria in the Mercantile Mutual Cup at the North Sydney Oval. He hit 61, including 18 off an over from Shane Warne, as NSW raced to their target of 194 with more than 14 overs to spare. Under new laws this season, NSW became the first side to pick up a bonus point for scoring at least 1.25 times as quickly as their opponents. Because of Australia's unexpected early departure from the ICC Knockout Trophy in Kenya, both teams had the luxury of fielding all their international players. But when Steve Waugh won the toss and asked Victoria to bat it was one of their lesser names that did the damage. Nathan Bracken, a 23-year-old left-arm seamer, took 4-36 as Victoria stumbled to 193. There were two wickets each for Shane Lee (2-33) and Stuart MacGill (2-40) but none for the international new-ball duo of Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee. NSW began explosively in reply. Brad Haddin creamed 69 off just 52 balls and added 109 for the first wicket with Slater. Warne, on his comeback after undergoing shoulder surgery, conceded 47 runs from six wicketless overs and was swiftly removed from the attack. Steve Waugh and Michael Bevan wrapped up the match in style. Victoria 193 in 48.5 overs (BJ Hodge 87) *New South Wales 197-2 in 35.5 overs New South Wales won by 8 wickets South Australia recorded their first win of the season when they beat Tasmania in a thrilling rain-affected match in Adelaide. Set 249 to win, Tasmania were on course while Ricky Ponting (68) and Michael Di Venuto (124) were adding 137 for the second wicket. And Di Venuto was still there with 10 needed off the last five balls. But he was brilliantly run out by the South Australian wicketkeeper Graham Manou, before Jason Gillespie bowled Dene Hills for 1 with a ball to go. Damien Wright needed to hit a six off the final ball to force a tie, but could manage just two. Earlier, SA made 248-6 off their 43 overs, with solid contributions from all the top order, although they were helped by some wayward bowling from the Tasmanians, who conceded 32 extras, including 23 in wides and no-balls. Gerard Denton, in his first match after a year's lay-off due to a back injury, conceded 40 off just three overs. South Australia 248-6 in 43 overs (JM Vaughan 57, CJ Davies 54) *Tasmania 244-5 in 43 overs South Australia won by 4 runs In the first-class Pura Cup, Queensland looked to be off to a flying start as they ran up 442 in their first innings against Western Australia at Perth, thanks mainly to 175 from Jimmy Maher and 128 from Stuart Law. The situation looked even brighter when they bowled WA out for 195 (Adam Dale 5-41) enforced the follow-on and then reduced them to 43/3 in their second innings. It all started to go wrong after that, though, as a lifeless pitch and some uninspired bowling allowed Damien Martyn to dig in for 78, before an unbeaten sixth-wicket partnership of 166 between Durham's Simon Katich and Adam Gilchrist spared the Western Australian blushes. Katich's gritty 105 not out took nearly eight hours, while Gilchrist's unbeaten 109, including 15 fours, was more aggressive. He smashed Dale for four fours in succession, then hit him for three more in a row in Dale's next over. Queensland 442 *Western Australia195 and 349-5 Match drawn Queensland win on first-innings lead Queensland 2pts, Western Australia 0 India The Rest of India thrashed Mumbai by 10 wickets as the Indian season got under way with its traditional curtain-raiser, the Irani Trophy. Mumbai, who were playing because they won last year's Ranji Trophy, started slowly in their first innings, but 56 from Wasim Jaffer, plus a late flurry by Ramesh Powar (40) and a last-wicket stand of 42 between Nulesh Kulkarni (14*) and Santosh Saxena (27) edged them towards a respectable 260. Offspinner Sharandeep Singh (4-55) and slow left-armer Murali Kartik (4-73) were the best of the Rest. The Rest's first innings was tottering at 29-3 before VVS Laxman took over - he stroked his way to 167 with impeccable timing, taking few risks along the way, and was backed up by Mohammed Kaif (75), with whom he shared a fourth-wicket stand of 201, and Jacob Martin (51). History beckoned in the Mumbai second innings, as Kartik picked up the first nine wickets in a bid to become only the fifth Indian to take all ten in a first-class game. It was not to be, though, as Singh snapped up the wicket of No. 11 Santosh Saxena for a first-ball duck. There was some consolation for Kartik as his figures of 9-70, coming off an unchanged spell of 24 overs, were a new record for the Irani Trophy. It gave him match figures of 13-143. The Rest, needing only 56 to win, quickly polished them off without loss to retain the trophy. *Mumbai 260 and 184 Rest of India 389 and 58-0 Rest of India won by 10 wickets Pakistan There were runs aplenty in the opening round of matches in the first-class Quaid-e- Azam Trophy first division, with no fewer than 10 centuries in the six matches. There were big wins for Sargodha, who beat Sheikhupura, and Faisalabad, who defeated Gujranwala. And, in two high-scoring matches, Lahore Blues beat Lahore, while Karachi overturned Karachi Blues, the highlight of the match being scores of 100* and 50* for Hasan Raza, who made his Test debut four years ago at the alleged age of 14.

Vauxhall, which has been selling a limited range of models on the web for the past year, said it would include all new models from November and would sell cars online for 3.5% cheaper than in the traditional manner. Not to be outdone, Ford announced it would sell cars via its website, and would start by selling new models of Ka, Puma, Focus and Fiesta at 5% cheaper than current prices. Ford's website, Fordjourney.com, launches at the end of this month. The company said it expects to have its full range of new cars available for purchase online by summer next year. Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford UK, said at the show: \"Ford fully intends to be a leader in e-commerce on the internet.\" Separately, Mazda has signed a deal with the car e-commerce site, Showroom4cars.com, which will see its UK dealerships becoming involved in the delivery of cars bought from the site, rather than completely being cut out of the equation.",

But he was unwilling to make firm predictions about News Corp's overall performance for the current financial year. Mr Murdoch pointed to the Fox TV broadcasting business in the US, which was facing a weaker advertising market after a strong start to the year. However, he said that News Corp's US TV business would enter 2001 in a much stronger position than the year before, with 19 Fox shows playing in prime time across five US networks. He also predicted that Fox News Channel would reach break-even by the second quarter of 2000-1. Mr Murdoch declined to give firm forecasts for the company's film business subsidiary, Fox, after a poor performance last year with the box office failure of animation Titan AE. But he noted that Fox had enjoyed recent success with X-Men and Big Momma's House.",

Speaking at a dinner for ITC members in Birmingham tonight, Sir Robin also accused the BBC of \"doing a disservice to the concept of public service broadcasting\". He said the BBC had cynically exploited the uncertainty surrounding ITV's schedule over the summer months and had merely moved the news to boost ratings for other programmes. \"I regret that the BBC have exploited the situation for what they consider might give them short-term scheduling advantage,\" he said. Sir Robin announced the results of two public consultations which it is submitting to the department of culture, media and sport, one on the roles for commercial television in public service broadcasting, one on regional television.

      "body": "<p>The Express and the Star are up for sale. What has been of late a more or less left-of-centre newspaper group is set to swing to the right again. Since most newspapers in this overcrowded scrum of a market are gut Tory, commercial sense doesn't come into it. The reason is that newspaper ownership has mainly been a hobby for mega-rich conservatives. Once they wanted to be land barons, now they want to be press barons. According to Roy Greenslade's reckoning, only the Sun, Sunday Times, Mail and Mail on Sunday make real profits, but newspapers give unknown businessmen the power to kick governments and make prime ministers grovel. </p> <p>Here's a story: who should be dining privately with the Blairs at Downing Street but the Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre and his wife? Thinking themselves among friends, Cherie brought the infant Leo in after dinner to breastfeed. The editor of the Mail turned green with shock and didn't know where to look. A mother's breast was more than this motherhood-and-apple-pie promoter could stomach. But the real shock is that he was there at all - he who trashes the government daily with gross distortion and calculated cynicism. Now the rightwing press has reverted to type, the prime minister should keep the whole tribe at dignified arm's length - no special briefings, no intimate Downing Street visits. </p> <p>Indeed there's a new hint of steeliness in the air, a murmur of a threat. Listen up, thugs. If Labour were to win the next election convincingly without the support of most of the press, the party would owe no favours. Muse on this. A first act once back in power could be a new media ownership bill. A return to the pre-Thatcher rules, no owner to have more than one national and one Sunday, limited cross-TV-and-press ownership and, as in most other countries, no non-EU citizen to own a paper at all. Goodbye Rupert. Goodbye Conrad. No doubt some of the divested papers would fall into equally bad hands, but many mavericks are better than mighty global empires. It's only a flicker of a dream but, say the voices, don't let the Sun imagine it will be enough to give last-minute support to Labour just before election day. </p> <p>Britain's poison press, the worst in the west, never represented the country: the balance of public opinion, as of votes, rests closer to the centre ground than the screaming front pages of most of the rightwing press. The battleships - Rupert Murdoch (owning 41% of total readership), Conrad Black and young Lord Rothermere - are barely challenged by the Guardian, the tiny Independent, the failing Express and the flailing Mirror. </p> <p>The ragbag of prospective buyers of the Express include: the Barclay brothers, fresh from destroying the Scotsman as a serious newspaper for the new Scotland, who would set Andrew Neil in the editor's chair to pump out rightwing anti-Europeanism sugared with hypocritical moralising (no chance, though, of beating the Mail at its own game); the deathly David Montgomery who destroyed the Mirror and the Independent as worthwhile endeavours, kills everything he touches (cuts and downmarket plunging are his specialties, but the Express needs the opposite); Mohamed Al Fayed would be bizarre; soft-porn merchant Richard Desmond, owner of OK, is an unappetising prospect. Other millionaires' names float. The best bet may be the mysterious Hinduja brothers, because nothing is known of them which is better than what's known of the rest. One-time Thatcher donors, they now swing behind Blair, who gave them British citizenship. Deeply religious Hindus, donating \u00a31m to the dome's faith zone, they await a decision on bribery charges in India. </p> <p>Does it matter who owns these insubstantial organs? As it stands, not really. It's the potential that matters. Although Lord Hollick took the titles to the left, as sales slip the Express has been grasping at Tory bandwagons again - campaigning against the government on pensions and supporting the fuel protesters. Like sinking political parties, failing newspapers splash out wildly in search of attention. But Rosie Boycott's editorship has shown the way it could go. She has picked up more women and more young readers. </p> <p> S ome say it's a dead duck, but others see a mid-market opportunity. There's a left-of-centre chance with cracks showing in the Mail's internal contradictions. The Mail may have peaked and could be challenged from the left: 38% of Mail readers voted Labour. Old hacks say left-leaning tabloids always fail - that the Mail and Sun are heavy hitters because they punch nasty, which makes good copy. They say it's hard to be trenchantly liberal, but the Guardian would demur. Myth says that the left tabloid Today failed. In fact it was bought and deliberately closed by Murdoch.

      "bodyText": "The Express and the Star are up for sale. What has been of late a more or less left-of-centre newspaper group is set to swing to the right again. Since most newspapers in this overcrowded scrum of a market are gut Tory, commercial sense doesn't come into it. The reason is that newspaper ownership has mainly been a hobby for mega-rich conservatives. Once they wanted to be land barons, now they want to be press barons. According to Roy Greenslade's reckoning, only the Sun, Sunday Times, Mail and Mail on Sunday make real profits, but newspapers give unknown businessmen the power to kick governments and make prime ministers grovel. Here's a story: who should be dining privately with the Blairs at Downing Street but the Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre and his wife? Thinking themselves among friends, Cherie brought the infant Leo in after dinner to breastfeed. The editor of the Mail turned green with shock and didn't know where to look. A mother's breast was more than this motherhood-and-apple-pie promoter could stomach. But the real shock is that he was there at all - he who trashes the government daily with gross distortion and calculated cynicism. Now the rightwing press has reverted to type, the prime minister should keep the whole tribe at dignified arm's length - no special briefings, no intimate Downing Street visits. Indeed there's a new hint of steeliness in the air, a murmur of a threat. Listen up, thugs. If Labour were to win the next election convincingly without the support of most of the press, the party would owe no favours. Muse on this. A first act once back in power could be a new media ownership bill. A return to the pre-Thatcher rules, no owner to have more than one national and one Sunday, limited cross-TV-and-press ownership and, as in most other countries, no non-EU citizen to own a paper at all. Goodbye Rupert. Goodbye Conrad. No doubt some of the divested papers would fall into equally bad hands, but many mavericks are better than mighty global empires. It's only a flicker of a dream but, say the voices, don't let the Sun imagine it will be enough to give last-minute support to Labour just before election day. Britain's poison press, the worst in the west, never represented the country: the balance of public opinion, as of votes, rests closer to the centre ground than the screaming front pages of most of the rightwing press. The battleships - Rupert Murdoch (owning 41% of total readership), Conrad Black and young Lord Rothermere - are barely challenged by the Guardian, the tiny Independent, the failing Express and the flailing Mirror. The ragbag of prospective buyers of the Express include: the Barclay brothers, fresh from destroying the Scotsman as a serious newspaper for the new Scotland, who would set Andrew Neil in the editor's chair to pump out rightwing anti-Europeanism sugared with hypocritical moralising (no chance, though, of beating the Mail at its own game); the deathly David Montgomery who destroyed the Mirror and the Independent as worthwhile endeavours, kills everything he touches (cuts and downmarket plunging are his specialties, but the Express needs the opposite); Mohamed Al Fayed would be bizarre; soft-porn merchant Richard Desmond, owner of OK, is an unappetising prospect. Other millionaires' names float. The best bet may be the mysterious Hinduja brothers, because nothing is known of them which is better than what's known of the rest. One-time Thatcher donors, they now swing behind Blair, who gave them British citizenship. Deeply religious Hindus, donating \u00a31m to the dome's faith zone, they await a decision on bribery charges in India. Does it matter who owns these insubstantial organs? As it stands, not really. It's the potential that matters. Although Lord Hollick took the titles to the left, as sales slip the Express has been grasping at Tory bandwagons again - campaigning against the government on pensions and supporting the fuel protesters. Like sinking political parties, failing newspapers splash out wildly in search of attention. But Rosie Boycott's editorship has shown the way it could go. She has picked up more women and more young readers. S ome say it's a dead duck, but others see a mid-market opportunity. There's a left-of-centre chance with cracks showing in the Mail's internal contradictions. The Mail may have peaked and could be challenged from the left: 38% of Mail readers voted Labour. Old hacks say left-leaning tabloids always fail - that the Mail and Sun are heavy hitters because they punch nasty, which makes good copy. They say it's hard to be trenchantly liberal, but the Guardian would demur. Myth says that the left tabloid Today failed. In fact it was bought and deliberately closed by Murdoch. Others dimly recall the demise of the old News Chronicle and the Daily Herald, or Murdoch's buying up of the nascent Sun, all creating the superstition that only the right knows how to be popular. They forget the Mirror in its heyday. It is accident of ownership that fat money has flowed to make rightwing papers more attractive in a country with a basically pluralist, tolerant, Lib-Lab majority. The Express could be both left and popular, but not on the cheap - that was Hollick's big mistake.

Another headline from the same newspaper 17 years earlier reads: \"Kennedy struck by rock in failed assassination attempt.\" The sub-head reads: \"A conspiracy of multiple hurlers is not ruled out.\" The date is November 1963 and the front page goes on to explain how Kennedy is preparing to withdraw US troops from Vietnam. A third front page is dated April 1968. \"Martin Luther King is hit by bottle in Memphis.\" The sub-head suggests that, while recovering, King has announced his plans to run for president in 1972. The three mock front pages have been causing people to stop and read further in Los Angeles over the last week or two. Imagine indeed. What would a live John Lennon have been up to these days? Would he still be performing? Would he have been singing for Ralph Nader in his election bid or would he have been taking part in Al Gore fund raisers? Would he be telling people not to bother voting? Would he even still be living in the United States? And John F Kennedy? Would he have been laid low by the likes of Kenneth Starr, his private life exposed by a less deferential press? Would he really have ended the war in Vietnam? Would he now be the elder statesman, sharing jokes with Bill Clinton, or would he be advertising cures for bad backs? And Martin Luther King - would he really have been the first black president of the United States? Would he have managed to change the course of history? At least we would have experienced a presidential campaign where one of the candidates knew how to make a decent speech. The link between the three stories, of course, is that all three had their lives cut short by guns. The posters are the work of a gun reform group who would like to see the issue of gun control debated more in the current elections. It is clear who the gun lovers would like to see in the White House. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has even congratulated itself on the fact that if George W Bush gets elected, the NRA will have its own office in the White House. Al Gore has made it clear that he does not want to curtail the rights of hunters, of people who want guns in their own homes for protection or of sportsmen. His proposals for change are modest. But now that the three presidential debates are over, it is clear that once again the whole issue of guns is one that is not going to be seriously argued. Guns are used in 61% of the 31,000 annual homicides in the US and in 68% of the 33,000 suicides. Gun ownership in the US has gone up by 50% in the last three decades. But just as neither Mr Gore nor Mr Bush were prepared to disagree over the death penalty in Tuesday night's debate, so the whole subject of firearms has not really been allowed onto the agenda. Last week, real headlines reported the news that a 12-year-old girl had been killed by a drive-by shooting. It looks as though it will be a long time before we are reading about children hurt slightly on the arm by a stone thrown from a car.",

      "body": "<p>There had seemed every chance that Arsenal would be thrown to the lions not far from Colosseum last night. So the draw they clinched with an 88th-minute goal from the substitute Robert Pires will give them a particular sense of pride. Moreover it secured their passage to the next group stage. </p> <p>Defending impressively, with Martin Keown outstanding, Arsenal kept the reserve goalkeeper John Lukic's contribution to a minimum and were beaten only by a cruel deflection off Silvinho before Pires latched on to a long ball from another French substitute, Silvain Wiltord, and clipped a neat shot over Angelo Peruzzi. When Lazio had the ball in the net in the dying seconds it was ruled out for a high challenge. </p> <p>This had always looked the ultimate test for Arsenal. Defeating the Champions League favourites 2-0 at Highbury last month had been impressive enough but repeating the feat - even avoiding defeat - in the imposing Stadio Olimpico had not promised to be a walk in the park. </p> <p>The task looked all the more difficult given that they were without their captain Tony Adams and goalkeeper David Seaman. Both were victims of back injuries, Seaman's apparently sustained getting out of bed despite rumours that he had suffered a ponytail strain. </p> <p>With Alex Manninger sidelined by a knee problem, Seaman's absence paved the way for an occurrence rarer even than a decent England performance. Lukic made his first start since March 1997 and a spot of history by becoming the oldest player to appear in the Champions League at 39 years 10 months. </p> <p>The feeling that he could be in for a busy night was exacerbated by the fact that on Lazio's bench sat two strikers worth \u00a354m between them in Claudio Lopez and Hernan Crespo. On Arsenal's was Stuart Taylor, a 19-year-old keeper yet to play for the first team, who was flown out as cover. </p> <p>As Wenger had warned, the key for his side lay in their ability to absorb pressure, keep possession and take their chances on the counter-attack against a side not renowned for defending.

      "bodyText": "There had seemed every chance that Arsenal would be thrown to the lions not far from Colosseum last night. So the draw they clinched with an 88th-minute goal from the substitute Robert Pires will give them a particular sense of pride. Moreover it secured their passage to the next group stage. Defending impressively, with Martin Keown outstanding, Arsenal kept the reserve goalkeeper John Lukic's contribution to a minimum and were beaten only by a cruel deflection off Silvinho before Pires latched on to a long ball from another French substitute, Silvain Wiltord, and clipped a neat shot over Angelo Peruzzi. When Lazio had the ball in the net in the dying seconds it was ruled out for a high challenge. This had always looked the ultimate test for Arsenal. Defeating the Champions League favourites 2-0 at Highbury last month had been impressive enough but repeating the feat - even avoiding defeat - in the imposing Stadio Olimpico had not promised to be a walk in the park. The task looked all the more difficult given that they were without their captain Tony Adams and goalkeeper David Seaman. Both were victims of back injuries, Seaman's apparently sustained getting out of bed despite rumours that he had suffered a ponytail strain. With Alex Manninger sidelined by a knee problem, Seaman's absence paved the way for an occurrence rarer even than a decent England performance. Lukic made his first start since March 1997 and a spot of history by becoming the oldest player to appear in the Champions League at 39 years 10 months. The feeling that he could be in for a busy night was exacerbated by the fact that on Lazio's bench sat two strikers worth \u00a354m between them in Claudio Lopez and Hernan Crespo. On Arsenal's was Stuart Taylor, a 19-year-old keeper yet to play for the first team, who was flown out as cover. As Wenger had warned, the key for his side lay in their ability to absorb pressure, keep possession and take their chances on the counter-attack against a side not renowned for defending. But, although it needed good tackles by Keown and Oleg Luzhny to deny Marcelo Salas and Simone Inzaghi in the opening five minutes, Arsenal gave as good as they got early on and might have taken the lead. When Fredrik Ljungberg, Lazio's executioner at Highbury, was fouled on the left, Silvinho sent over a fine curling free-kick which the unmarked Gilles Grimandi headed just wide. Lazio twice made headway down the left but their crosses flashed across the face of goal and Arsenal's defence, which could soon include the teenage Georgia international Zurab Khizanishvili, who has been invited for a trial, was holding firm. Luzhny and Keown in particular were impressive. Then, in the 24th minute, Lukic was beaten in the harshest circumstances. A neat combination involving Juan Sebastian Veron, Salas and Inzaghi culminated in Pavel Nedved hitting a shot which took a big deflection off the lunging Silvinho and looped over the keeper's head and in off the bar.

Silvinho was denied a spectacular equaliser when, after beating Dejan Stankovic and Alessandro Nesta, his shot was saved by Peruzzi.

      "byline": "Paul Weaver  in Karachi",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>England's fast bowlers took one look at the pitch at the National stadium here and walked hastily away, as one might from a particularly nasty accident. </p> <p>There was little grass, so they can forget about seam movement. And although the pitch had been rolled and was hard enough to resemble polished concrete, not much bounce can be expected. Neither will there be much in the way of conventional swing, for the Kookaburra balls will soon lose their shine. </p> <p>Oh, and it was hot too. It has been as high as 37C this week, just a bead of perspiration below 100F, and it seems even hotter in the shadowless interior of this concrete-bowl stadium. Cheltenham it ain't. </p> <p>England's quick bowlers are not fast enough to cause problems with pace alone, and Andy Caddick, the best of them when on song, is most effective when bowling aggressively just short of a length with bounce and seam movement and will therefore be restricted when the tour opens here on Friday with a one-day warm-up game against a Governor's XI. </p> <p>So it is the reverse swingers, Darren Gough, Craig White and, when the three-Test series starts on November 15 in Lahore, Dominic Cork who may be the key bowlers. Gough and White ruefully acknowledged this after their first net session here, a sweaty three-hour job that had them grabbing for the bottled water like men in the Gobi with a dodgy compass. Forget thigh strains, meltdown may be the killer here. </p> <p>\"I think both Chalks [White] and myself will be expected to reverse it,\" said Gough. \"I think I will open up with Andy. But I will probably come off after a few overs with a view to coming back. </p> <p>\"I learned to reverse by looking at Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. In fact I bowl a little like Waqar. But in Pakistan, until now, I've only bowled with a white ball [in the 1996 World Cup].\" </p> <p>Last summer White made a considerable impact against West Indies. He is able to generate real pace with his slingshot action, even though he ambles in off a short run. But his ability to reverse - he developed a particularly troublesome line against the left-handers - made him one of the successes of the season. </p> <p>\"Basically I learned to do it by watching others,\" said this former purveyor of gentle off-spin. \"It's something you pick up in the dressing room.\" </p> <p>Reverse swing probably originated in Pakistan, where the bowlers constantly work on the ball to counter the discouraging conditions. It was employed long before Imran Khan refined it and, with his hostile pace, made it most effective. But it is in the past decade, through the deeds of Wasim and Waqar, that it has become a voguish weapon. </p> <p>Gough, for the moment, is more concerned with the three-match one-day series, which starts here on Tuesday. \"I'm just thinking about how to control the ball for the first 15 overs. For me, this is when these matches will be decided, as we saw in the World Cup that was held here.\" </p> <p>Wasim, meanwhile, has responded to the call from the ECB chairman Lord MacLaurin for the former captain and the other five players implicated and fined after the Qayyum match-fixing report to be stood down for the Test series. \"I strongly condemn that, and all such calls are unnecessary and negative tactics before the all-important Test series,\" Wasim said. \"These people are trying to distract us.\" </p> <p>The journalist insulted by Mike Atherton during the 1996 World Cup has threatened to sue him unless the former England captain offers a public apology within 10 days.

      "bodyText": "England's fast bowlers took one look at the pitch at the National stadium here and walked hastily away, as one might from a particularly nasty accident. There was little grass, so they can forget about seam movement. And although the pitch had been rolled and was hard enough to resemble polished concrete, not much bounce can be expected. Neither will there be much in the way of conventional swing, for the Kookaburra balls will soon lose their shine. Oh, and it was hot too. It has been as high as 37C this week, just a bead of perspiration below 100F, and it seems even hotter in the shadowless interior of this concrete-bowl stadium. Cheltenham it ain't. England's quick bowlers are not fast enough to cause problems with pace alone, and Andy Caddick, the best of them when on song, is most effective when bowling aggressively just short of a length with bounce and seam movement and will therefore be restricted when the tour opens here on Friday with a one-day warm-up game against a Governor's XI. So it is the reverse swingers, Darren Gough, Craig White and, when the three-Test series starts on November 15 in Lahore, Dominic Cork who may be the key bowlers. Gough and White ruefully acknowledged this after their first net session here, a sweaty three-hour job that had them grabbing for the bottled water like men in the Gobi with a dodgy compass. Forget thigh strains, meltdown may be the killer here. \"I think both Chalks [White] and myself will be expected to reverse it,\" said Gough. \"I think I will open up with Andy. But I will probably come off after a few overs with a view to coming back. \"I learned to reverse by looking at Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. In fact I bowl a little like Waqar. But in Pakistan, until now, I've only bowled with a white ball [in the 1996 World Cup].\" Last summer White made a considerable impact against West Indies. He is able to generate real pace with his slingshot action, even though he ambles in off a short run. But his ability to reverse - he developed a particularly troublesome line against the left-handers - made him one of the successes of the season. \"Basically I learned to do it by watching others,\" said this former purveyor of gentle off-spin. \"It's something you pick up in the dressing room.\" Reverse swing probably originated in Pakistan, where the bowlers constantly work on the ball to counter the discouraging conditions. It was employed long before Imran Khan refined it and, with his hostile pace, made it most effective. But it is in the past decade, through the deeds of Wasim and Waqar, that it has become a voguish weapon. Gough, for the moment, is more concerned with the three-match one-day series, which starts here on Tuesday. \"I'm just thinking about how to control the ball for the first 15 overs. For me, this is when these matches will be decided, as we saw in the World Cup that was held here.\" Wasim, meanwhile, has responded to the call from the ECB chairman Lord MacLaurin for the former captain and the other five players implicated and fined after the Qayyum match-fixing report to be stood down for the Test series. \"I strongly condemn that, and all such calls are unnecessary and negative tactics before the all-important Test series,\" Wasim said. \"These people are trying to distract us.\" The journalist insulted by Mike Atherton during the 1996 World Cup has threatened to sue him unless the former England captain offers a public apology within 10 days. Asghar Ali had posed a question in broken English and Atherton had retorted: \"Can someone get this buffoon out of here?\" \u0095 Lawyers for the disgraced Hansie Cronje have confirmed that the former South Africa captain will sue the United Cricket Board after it failed to rescind his life ban.",

Paper ownership of these non-existent serfs would, he hoped, boost his social standing and act as collateral against large loans.</p> <p>The present-day government official in Kolomna, a small town 100 miles south-east of Moscow, exploited the inefficiency of the modern system: she persuaded impoverished citizens to sell her the rights to fabricated dead relatives in order to collect their burial allowances.</p> <p>Using her position as the acting head of a state benefit payment office, she talked willing Kolomna residents into taking forged papers, authorising the issue of a funeral grant, to their local post office, where they received 830 roubles (\u00a321).</p> <p>Under the deal, they returned most of the money to the civil servant, keeping just 50 roubles (\u00a31.25) for themselves.</p> <p>The town's poorest inhabitants were eager to participate in the fraud, grateful for even the small payment they received. Freelance taxi drivers and local soldiers were frequently recruited to provide imaginary dead relatives for the city official.</p> <p>After an internal audit uncovered the scam, the civil servant was imprisoned, just as Chichikov was. A trial will begin next week and she faces up to 10 years in jail.</p> <p>The local prosecutor, Gennady Lichikov, sensitive to the very mention of Gogol, who cruelly ridiculed provincial prosecutors in his plays, admitted that there were parallels between the author's 1842 satire and the Kolomna scandal.</p> <p>\"This case, just like the immortal Gogol's work, involves dead souls,\" he said. \"The hero of Dead Souls bought up the documents of non-existent people in order to make himself a rich landowner. The heroine [sic] of this case has manipulated the documents of non-existent people for her personal profit.\"</p> <p>But, he added, the readiness of local inhabitants to sell off fictitious family members for such pitiful sums of money reflected a state of utter destitution more reminiscent of Maxim Gorky's play, The Lower Depths.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A provincial civil servant - apparently inspired by Nikolai Gogol's classic Russian satire, Dead Souls - has been arrested for inventing 250 dead citizens to claim funeral grants from the government. The woman, who has not been named, managed to defraud the state of 330,000 roubles (about \u00a38,200) over two years, after collecting hundreds of state subsidies paid out to help needy families bury their dead. The hero of Gogol's novel, Paul Chichikov, a retired government official, planned to make himself rich by exploiting the bureaucratic chaos within the 19th century Russian state to buy dead souls (serfs who had died, but who were still listed on the tax rolls) from provincial landowners. Paper ownership of these non-existent serfs would, he hoped, boost his social standing and act as collateral against large loans. The present-day government official in Kolomna, a small town 100 miles south-east of Moscow, exploited the inefficiency of the modern system: she persuaded impoverished citizens to sell her the rights to fabricated dead relatives in order to collect their burial allowances. Using her position as the acting head of a state benefit payment office, she talked willing Kolomna residents into taking forged papers, authorising the issue of a funeral grant, to their local post office, where they received 830 roubles (\u00a321). Under the deal, they returned most of the money to the civil servant, keeping just 50 roubles (\u00a31.25) for themselves. The town's poorest inhabitants were eager to participate in the fraud, grateful for even the small payment they received. Freelance taxi drivers and local soldiers were frequently recruited to provide imaginary dead relatives for the city official. After an internal audit uncovered the scam, the civil servant was imprisoned, just as Chichikov was. A trial will begin next week and she faces up to 10 years in jail. The local prosecutor, Gennady Lichikov, sensitive to the very mention of Gogol, who cruelly ridiculed provincial prosecutors in his plays, admitted that there were parallels between the author's 1842 satire and the Kolomna scandal. \"This case, just like the immortal Gogol's work, involves dead souls,\" he said. \"The hero of Dead Souls bought up the documents of non-existent people in order to make himself a rich landowner. The heroine [sic] of this case has manipulated the documents of non-existent people for her personal profit.\" But, he added, the readiness of local inhabitants to sell off fictitious family members for such pitiful sums of money reflected a state of utter destitution more reminiscent of Maxim Gorky's play, The Lower Depths.",

They are being treated at the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in Welwyn Garden City, Herts. A further 11 men and 12 women aged between 20 and 65, were being treated at the hospital for cuts, bruises and whiplash. Staff at the Lister hospital in Stevenage treated seven people for minor injuries.",

      "bodyText": "Yugoslavia's president, Vojislav Kostunica, failed yesterday to persuade the leaders of Serbia's small sister republic of Montenegro to join the next federal government of Yugoslavia. After a visit of several hours, he secured only an agreement to keep talking: \"I am satisfied and when the talks become fruitful you will be informed,\" he told reporters. The Montenegrin president, Milo Djukanovic, who applauded the democratic changes in Serbia since Mr Kostunica took office on October 7, said he would take part in national institutions only if Yugoslavia's two republics redefined their relationship. While Mr Djukanovic politely referred to Mr Kostunica as president, the Montenegrin government itself declared last month's elections in Yugoslavia illegal and refused to recognise Mr Kostunica as the new Yugoslav president. Mr Djukanovic himself remains angry about a plan by Mr Kostunica's allies to offer the position of prime minister of Yugoslavia to his Montenegrin rivals, who had supported Slobodan Milosevic. Mr Kostunica's task was delicate; any move by Montenegro to secede would destroy Yugoslavia and undermine the basis of his rule. Yet, short of a risky lurch towards independence - which would be opposed by the Yugoslav army, western governments and a large part of Montenegro's people - President Djukanovic's government has few bargaining cards. Mr Milosevic's defeat has left it nervous and uncertain. While he was in power in Serbia, western states flattered and supported Mr Djukanovic and poured money into the small territory, which has a population of 600,000 compared to Serbia's 10m. Now the west's attentions have turned to Belgrade. Montenegro not only fears a loss of aid but also increasing pressure from the west to forge close links with Serbia and drop its aim of turning Yugoslavia into a loose federation of two sovereign states, let alone any thought of independence. Montenegro's relations with Belgrade are also in crisis. Mr Djukanovic did not recognise the last Yugoslav government on the grounds that Mr Milosevic formed it illegally by appointing the Montenegrin opposition leader, who heads the pro-Belgrade party, as prime minister. Similarly, he boycotted the elections which brought Mr Milosevic's downfall on the grounds that the constitution had been changed illegally. As a result, Mr Djukanovic has no MPs in the federal parliament. Worse still, Mr Kostunica has said that - like Mr Milosevic - he will nominate a leader of the pro-Belgrade party as federal prime minister. (By convention, when the president is a Serb, the premier is Montenegrin). Mr Djukanovic had urged Mr Kostunica to appoint a non-political \"government of experts\" to avoid the issue, but the Yugoslav president needs the pro-Belgrade party to give him a majority in parliament. After a five-hour crisis meeting with senior ministers on the eve of Mr Kostunica's visit, President Djukanovic decided to heed western warnings to be patient and supportive of Belgrade. The Yugoslav army also remains an irritant to the Montenegrins. The Yugoslav Second Army, which is based in Montenegro, was regularly used by Mr Milosevic as a pressure point. Mr Djukanovic was also concerned when the army last year created a special paramilitary force, the seventh battalion. It was seen as a weapon for mounting a coup. The least the Montenegrin government wants immediately is the disbandment of the seventh battalion, and the withdrawal of the extra troops sent to Montenegro on the eve of last month's elections. But General Nebojsa Pavkovic, the long-time Milosevic loyalist whom Mr Kostunica seems unwilling to sack as army chief of staff said this weekend: \"The extra troops will remain until the relevant political decisions are taken.\"",

It could go anywhere, and you do not get an account back on how it was spent.\"</p> <p>In his book Mr Robinson stated: \"I was happy to support the political offices of Gordon and Tony, just as I had for Neil Kinnock and John Smith.\"</p> <p>On BBC2's Newsnight programme on Monday, Mr Robinson got himself in a tangle on whether he had funded the office through Mr Blair's \"blind trust\" fund - money from donors who are supposed to remain anonymous.</p> <p>Most observers do not believe that the recipients are ignorant of the donors' identities. Lord Neill, chairman of the committee on standards in public life, has recommended that blind trusts be abolished. They will be outlawed in a new party funding act in the new year.</p> <p>Mr Robinson was faced on Monday with a denial from Lady Jay, who chairs the trustees of Mr Blair's fund.

      "bodyText": "Geoffrey Robinson was forced yesterday to back down on the claim in his book that he directly funded Tony Blair's political office. He claimed in the book, An Unconventional Minister, that he funded the office in the run-up to the general election, but he admitted on Radio 4's World at One programme that his cheques were made out to the Labour party general fund. A Labour peer who has raised money for the party told the Guardian: \"However large the donation and however important the donor, they cannot specify where the money goes if they give the cash to the general fund. It could go anywhere, and you do not get an account back on how it was spent.\" In his book Mr Robinson stated: \"I was happy to support the political offices of Gordon and Tony, just as I had for Neil Kinnock and John Smith.\" On BBC2's Newsnight programme on Monday, Mr Robinson got himself in a tangle on whether he had funded the office through Mr Blair's \"blind trust\" fund - money from donors who are supposed to remain anonymous. Most observers do not believe that the recipients are ignorant of the donors' identities. Lord Neill, chairman of the committee on standards in public life, has recommended that blind trusts be abolished. They will be outlawed in a new party funding act in the new year. Mr Robinson was faced on Monday with a denial from Lady Jay, who chairs the trustees of Mr Blair's fund. She said: \"The only donations Geoffrey Robinson made were general donations to the Labour party. He did not donate any money to Tony Blair's private office.\" Mr Robinson insisted that this was just a \"narrow point\" adding: \"My support for his office is known.\" Yesterday on the World at One, under specific questioning, he said: \"As far as I remember I made it [the payment] through the Labour party itself, and that is the end of it.\" Party accounts show that he made donations of over \u00a35,000 in 1995, 1996 and 1997 to the general fund. Mr Robinson said he had checked his own records of his donations before he wrote his book. These are kept by his secretary, Brenda Price, and are said to show that the cheques were made out to the Labour party and not to the leader's blind trust. Party procedures allow general donations to be used on a wide range of activities, such as leaflets, travel costs of the leader and the shadow cabinet, and the electricity bill for Labour's headquarters at Millbank. In theory, some of Mr Robinson's money could have been spent on activities involving Tony Blair, but he would not have been told. This is quite different from Mr Robinson's donations to Gordon Brown, the chancellor, which went on specific research programmes - and he has outlined them in his book. David Heathcoat-Amory, shadow trade and industry secretary, demanded a fresh investigation by Elizabeth Filkin, parliamentary commissioner for standards, of Mr Robinson's claims in his book. Mr Heathcoat-Amory said Mr Blair and Mr Brown had failed to declare the funding in the register of members interests, and that \"it is not clear if Mr Robinson's donations were made direct to the MPs concerned, or through a blind trust\".",

When they quit government in December 1998, they remained friends. But Robinson was infuriated by Mandelson's return as Northern Ireland secretary. Out in the cold he felt hurt and forgotten. Foolishly Mandelson had failed to invite him to his housewarming party in Notting Hill. Politically naive, manipulated by his Iagos and embittered, Robinson has this week hawked his grievance round the TV studios. But it was not all pique. All the while he was also being encouraged by political allies who want to see Mandelson and his agenda removed from office forever. Who was behind it? In what was supposed to be an off-the-record interview with the Mirror yesterday, Mandelson, no slouch at mud-slinging himself, blamed Charlie Whelan, Gordon Brown's ex-press aide, now a freelance journalist and outside the Brown inner circle. Mandelson told the Mirror's editor Piers Morgan, he had every sympathy with Robinson. \"He is a kind and generous man who does not deserve what has happened to him. But others have manipulated him and made him attack me now and I find that very sad... Geoffrey is a vulnerable guy being used for dubious political motives by people who have an agenda against me\". What is striking about Robinson's Brownite account of cabinet tensions on tactics for handling the EU single currency issue is that it puts all the blame on Mandelson, when Robin Cook and Stephen Byers have also been making the pro-euro case. As another pro-European minister explains: \"This is not just about the past, or revenge. This is about the future and taking Peter out. This is about removing what they perceive to be a strong pro-European influence around the prime minister.\"",

      "body": "<p>India has sold its entire fleet of Westland helicopters back to Britain for the scrap value of just \u00a3900,000, nine years after the machines were found to be technically faulty and grounded.</p> <p>In an ignominious epilogue to the Westland saga, nine of the 19 helicopters acquired by India for \u00a365m in the mid-1980s have been shipped back to the UK to be stripped down for spare parts. The second and final consignment is expected to leave Bombay by the end of the year.</p> <p>India's state-owned helicopter firm, Pawan Hans Helicopters, which operated the Westland 30s, dispatched the first shipment to AES Aerospace, a British firm based in West Sussex, in July. The flawed machines had spent the previous eight years rusting in crates at New Delhi's Safdarjung airport.</p> <p>\"We have not made any firm plans about what to do with them,\" AES's managing director, Vic Aven, said last night. The contract to ship the helicopters back to his firm's depot in East Grinstead was agreed two-and-a-half years ago but only signed last year, he said. He denied that the final shipment had been withheld due to \"payment problems\". The troubled helicopters might be repaired and flown commercially, he added.</p> <p>India bought 21 Westland 30s in 1985 after Margaret Thatcher persuaded Rajiv Gandhi, then prime minister, to ignore the advice of his aviation experts, who were against the sale. The money came out of Britain's aid budget and was given to India on condition it bought the helicopters.</p> <p>The deal - later described by officials as a \"catastrophic waste of money\" - bailed Westland and Mrs Thatcher out of trouble (though it failed to prevent the resignation of Michael Heseltine, then defence secretary).</p> <p>The 14-seater Westland 30s proved to be highly unreliable and a commercial disaster. Soon after their arrival in India in 1987 two crashed - one in the north Indian state of Jammu, and another in Nagaland killing 10 people. They proved to be unsuited to the tropical climate, needed constant servicing and repairs, and were flown only sporadically.</p> <p>In 1991 the helicopters were withdrawn from service on safety grounds. Two years later, after obtaining permission from the British government under the original 1985 \"sale\" agreement, Pawan Hans invited global tenders for the Westland 30s. But no one wanted to pay the \u00a31.9m reserve price. Eventually AES Aerospace emerged as sole bidder.

      "bodyText": "India has sold its entire fleet of Westland helicopters back to Britain for the scrap value of just \u00a3900,000, nine years after the machines were found to be technically faulty and grounded. In an ignominious epilogue to the Westland saga, nine of the 19 helicopters acquired by India for \u00a365m in the mid-1980s have been shipped back to the UK to be stripped down for spare parts. The second and final consignment is expected to leave Bombay by the end of the year. India's state-owned helicopter firm, Pawan Hans Helicopters, which operated the Westland 30s, dispatched the first shipment to AES Aerospace, a British firm based in West Sussex, in July. The flawed machines had spent the previous eight years rusting in crates at New Delhi's Safdarjung airport. \"We have not made any firm plans about what to do with them,\" AES's managing director, Vic Aven, said last night. The contract to ship the helicopters back to his firm's depot in East Grinstead was agreed two-and-a-half years ago but only signed last year, he said. He denied that the final shipment had been withheld due to \"payment problems\". The troubled helicopters might be repaired and flown commercially, he added. India bought 21 Westland 30s in 1985 after Margaret Thatcher persuaded Rajiv Gandhi, then prime minister, to ignore the advice of his aviation experts, who were against the sale. The money came out of Britain's aid budget and was given to India on condition it bought the helicopters. The deal - later described by officials as a \"catastrophic waste of money\" - bailed Westland and Mrs Thatcher out of trouble (though it failed to prevent the resignation of Michael Heseltine, then defence secretary). The 14-seater Westland 30s proved to be highly unreliable and a commercial disaster. Soon after their arrival in India in 1987 two crashed - one in the north Indian state of Jammu, and another in Nagaland killing 10 people. They proved to be unsuited to the tropical climate, needed constant servicing and repairs, and were flown only sporadically. In 1991 the helicopters were withdrawn from service on safety grounds. Two years later, after obtaining permission from the British government under the original 1985 \"sale\" agreement, Pawan Hans invited global tenders for the Westland 30s. But no one wanted to pay the \u00a31.9m reserve price. Eventually AES Aerospace emerged as sole bidder. So far it has paid \u00a3450,000, half the sale price. Last night Pawan Hans said that the return of the helicopters to Britain would soon be completed. A spokesman for Westland helicopters last night admitted that sales of the W30s had been \"mediocre\". The helicopter, a civilian version of the Lynx, was no longer in production after the civil aviation authority withdrew its licence. Three years ago the international development secretary, Clare Short, ordered an inquiry into the helicopter deal, which she described as \"outrageous\". She criticised Lady Thatcher's role in the affair, saying it showed the importance of de-linking aid from political considerations. The national audit office, in its subsequent investigation, concluded that the government lost more than \u00a3105m, including money on research. Since the helicopters' purchase price was paid for using British aid, the Indian government is obliged to return the \u00a3900,000 to the UK's department for international development. In a final irony, though, Ms Short has pledged that the money will be sent back to India again to be used for poverty alleviation.",

      "body": "<p>The London stockmarket's automatic settlement system, Crest, yesterday \"lost\" a \u00a330bn company, after becoming confused about a capital reshuffling by the insurance firm Zurich Financial Services. </p> <p>Investors were left in limbo for much of the day as millions of pounds worth of shares in the company disappeared from their settlement accounts overnight. The confusion arose after London-based Allied Zurich, which owned 43% of Zurich Financial Services, was absorbed into the Swiss company on Monday. Investors ought to have been automatically allocated shares in the combined organisation, which has a primary listing in Switzerland and a secondary quote in London. </p> <p>But a \"technical error\" meant that all trace of the insurance company disappeared from Crest's systems, which are used by nearly all institutions trading in blue-chip shares. A Crest spokesman said: \"The cross-border corporate action was an immensely complicated one. There were technical issues which meant that the out-turned security which should have appeared in settlement accounts was slightly delayed.\" </p> <p>The error was corrected during the late afternoon. Furious traders had spent hours trying to establish their positions. </p> <p>\"We had a large position in this company and today, at the crucial moment, we were unable to complete our business,\" one senior arbitrage trader said. \"Having a reliable and robust settlement system is crucial to any equity market and today it failed.\" Until this week, big investment banks, typically the large Wall Street firms, have routinely traded between Allied Zurich in London and Zurich Financial in Switzerland, picking up profits from price discrepancies between the two markets. Their trading positions in the stock typically run to tens of millions of pounds. </p> <p>One fund manager was quoted as saying: \"We have wasted half a day trying to reconcile this bargain.

      "bodyText": "The London stockmarket's automatic settlement system, Crest, yesterday \"lost\" a \u00a330bn company, after becoming confused about a capital reshuffling by the insurance firm Zurich Financial Services. Investors were left in limbo for much of the day as millions of pounds worth of shares in the company disappeared from their settlement accounts overnight. The confusion arose after London-based Allied Zurich, which owned 43% of Zurich Financial Services, was absorbed into the Swiss company on Monday. Investors ought to have been automatically allocated shares in the combined organisation, which has a primary listing in Switzerland and a secondary quote in London. But a \"technical error\" meant that all trace of the insurance company disappeared from Crest's systems, which are used by nearly all institutions trading in blue-chip shares. A Crest spokesman said: \"The cross-border corporate action was an immensely complicated one. There were technical issues which meant that the out-turned security which should have appeared in settlement accounts was slightly delayed.\" The error was corrected during the late afternoon. Furious traders had spent hours trying to establish their positions. \"We had a large position in this company and today, at the crucial moment, we were unable to complete our business,\" one senior arbitrage trader said. \"Having a reliable and robust settlement system is crucial to any equity market and today it failed.\" Until this week, big investment banks, typically the large Wall Street firms, have routinely traded between Allied Zurich in London and Zurich Financial in Switzerland, picking up profits from price discrepancies between the two markets. Their trading positions in the stock typically run to tens of millions of pounds. One fund manager was quoted as saying: \"We have wasted half a day trying to reconcile this bargain. We are trying to sort it out and move the UK position to the Swiss one but we can't.\" Crest stressed that no one had permanently lost any shares. Crest's spokesman said: \"No blame is being apportioned to any party. It would be inappropriate to start pointing fingers.\" The insurance group's complicated capital arrangements date back to a merger two years ago between Zurich Financial Services and the financial arm of British American Tobacco. The firm kept a dual share structure but has unified them after becoming frustrated that the London-listed end traded at a constant discount to shares in Switzerland.",

Apparently, the condition causes one to fall over as though one were dead or extremely bored with one's surroundings (those close to William Hague may be familiar with the symptoms) and it was only because she motivated herself into moving that she wasn't buried alive.

Turned on by pain, you'd think Brett might have tried getting his back waxed before going for the bollocks- in-secateurs option, but he got a thrill from the fantasy of castration so the reality proved irresistable. Testicle-less, Brett felt complete though his penis did resemble a forlorn German sausage. It wasn't a pretty sight. </p> <p>Now an internet agony uncle to those who fantasise about and seek castration - with agony being the operative word - Brett helps other men who suffer from a castration compulsion like his. Since such men cannot approach surgeons for help, they are left alone and to their own devices, devices which include big chopping plier-type things and other bloodcurdling implements which will have had the male audience crossing their legs at the very least, and running screaming from the room at the not-so-very least. I know I should understand and sympathise with these men, most of whom seemed not to know from where their compulsion came, and say c'est la vie to the ever-expanding boundaries of human sexuality and the expression thereof, but I'm sorry, I can't. Get over \"the ick factor\" and this documentary may be an amazing insight into a heretofore unknown world, but don't get over it and you'll be flicking over to A Touch Of Frost with indecent haste. Suddenly, premature burial alongside David Jason seems an attractive option. </p> <p>As part of <strong> Channel 4 News </strong> , Naomi Klein introduced an informative, entertaining item, based on her excellent book, No Logo. Travelling from Seattle, home of Starbucks and Microsoft, to Prague, she eloquently exposed the multi-national corporations' hypocrisies, the main one being how they pursue us as consumers but abandon us as workers. With the CEO of Starbucks now named as one of Britain's most powerful people, the time is ripe for a whole series about the corporations which shape our lives, rather than a mere 24 minutes. </p> <p>Phrases you don't often hear about television, number three: \" <strong> Attachments</strong> (BBC2) is just getting better and better.\"</p>",

I know I should understand and sympathise with these men, most of whom seemed not to know from where their compulsion came, and say c'est la vie to the ever-expanding boundaries of human sexuality and the expression thereof, but I'm sorry, I can't. Get over \"the ick factor\" and this documentary may be an amazing insight into a heretofore unknown world, but don't get over it and you'll be flicking over to A Touch Of Frost with indecent haste. Suddenly, premature burial alongside David Jason seems an attractive option. As part of Channel 4 News , Naomi Klein introduced an informative, entertaining item, based on her excellent book, No Logo. Travelling from Seattle, home of Starbucks and Microsoft, to Prague, she eloquently exposed the multi-national corporations' hypocrisies, the main one being how they pursue us as consumers but abandon us as workers. With the CEO of Starbucks now named as one of Britain's most powerful people, the time is ripe for a whole series about the corporations which shape our lives, rather than a mere 24 minutes. Phrases you don't often hear about television, number three: \" Attachments (BBC2) is just getting better and better.\"",

      "body": "<p>The \u00a3233m deal to buy teenage spots remedy Clearasil is Boots' biggest acquisition since its disastrous purchase of retail conglomerate Ward White 10 years ago. </p> <p>It paid \u00a3900m for the Halfords, Payless and Fads group, but within a year it was clear it had overpaid - outrageously. Far from putting some fizz into Boots, Ward White was a white elephant which succeeded only in denting Boots' profitability. Piecemeal, it was unloaded and today only Halfords remains part of the Boots empire. </p> <p>That dismal deal was the brainchild of Lord Blyth, then chief executive. It is probably no coincidence that this new adventure into dealmaking comes only shortly after his departure as chairman. </p> <p>But the Clearasil acquisition looks far from being a Ward White-style stinker. It adds \u00a394m annual sales to Boots Healthcare International - until now a \u00a3200m-a-year business. And that is before Boots rebrands a variety of French and German spot creams it already owns. It will also give BHI access to crucial American and Japanese markets for other big brands like Nurofen and E45. </p> <p>Above all it will draw attention to BHI - a wallflower of a business, currently afflicted by the cloud of gloom which is hanging over all retail stocks. </p> <p>Boots has its problems - not least its 120 stores in town centres with too much square footage now that it is pulling out of the home and leisure merchandise which traditionally filled its second floors. Boots is trialling services such as physiotherapy and beauty treatments in those wide open spaces and crossing its fingers the plan will work. </p> <p>Analysts reckon BHI alone could be worth \u00a31bn. If the new services show any signs of success - and there are encouraging signs, according to insiders - then Boots' share price is far too low. </p> <p><strong> Granada's gain </strong><br> </p> <p>There also is something rather churlish about the way the investment community has treated Granada Compass since the hotels and catering group was created in the summer. </p> <p>The first raspberry came on day one, with the City complaining that splitting the old Granada in two and merging its hotels with Compass risked diluting the reputation for go-go growth built on the pure catering side by Francis Mackay. So, last month news leaked here that Mr Mackay and his new chairman, Gerry Robinson, had accepted the City's arguments and were now ready to sell the hotels to French rival Accor. The market's reaction was one of indifference. </p> <p>This week news emerged that Accor has pulled out of the talks, leaving Granada Compass to put the business up for auction instead. The market's reaction this time? Fresh hostility. </p> <p>Now, it is argued, the whole thing will drag on deep into next year, with Compass probably being forced to sell off the various hotel brands piecemeal. Shares in Compass fell another 1.25% yesterday to make a shocking 32% loss over the past six weeks. </p> <p>This appears to be a classic case of one-speed thinking in the City, where being in line with the consensus tends to be a greater prize than being right. </p> <p>Whatever Messrs Robinson and Mackay say, it is a safe bet that the two planned to sell the hotels business from the outset - the complexity of the overall merger dictating that this part of the grand plan would have to wait. It can also be assumed that the leaking of the Compass/Accor discussions was more damaging to the French group's negotiating position than to the British firm. Accor stock slumped on fears it would have to raise cash to complete what was likely to be a \u00a33bn deal. </p> <p>It is fair speculation that Compass received a number of 11th hour offers for the hotels once it became clear it was genuinely ready to sell. And it is not too much of a leap of faith to believe that Compass would only have allowed Accor to flounce away from the negotiating table if it were confident of achieving better value elsewhere. </p> <p>It has taken 10 years to turn Granada from a sprawling, underperforming wreck into two lean, well managed Footsie businesses. Griping now over whether the job is completed in two months or four months is plain crass. </p> <p><strong>Void vision</strong><br> </p> <p>There it was, gone. Anglo-Swiss insurer Allied Zurich switched its primary share listing this week from Britain to Switzerland, becoming Zurich Financial from yesterday morning. But London's trading community did not receive their new shares. They could not trade and, in effect, this \u00a330bn European blue chip all but disappeared for a day. </p> <p>It was not immediately clear who was at fault, with the Crest settlement authorities in London blaming the Swiss. But the affair is another reminder that in an increasingly sophisticated international investment environment, Europe's trading and settlement infrastructure remains a long way short of adequate.</p>",

Boots is trialling services such as physiotherapy and beauty treatments in those wide open spaces and crossing its fingers the plan will work. Analysts reckon BHI alone could be worth \u00a31bn. If the new services show any signs of success - and there are encouraging signs, according to insiders - then Boots' share price is far too low. Granada's gain There also is something rather churlish about the way the investment community has treated Granada Compass since the hotels and catering group was created in the summer. The first raspberry came on day one, with the City complaining that splitting the old Granada in two and merging its hotels with Compass risked diluting the reputation for go-go growth built on the pure catering side by Francis Mackay. So, last month news leaked here that Mr Mackay and his new chairman, Gerry Robinson, had accepted the City's arguments and were now ready to sell the hotels to French rival Accor. The market's reaction was one of indifference. This week news emerged that Accor has pulled out of the talks, leaving Granada Compass to put the business up for auction instead. The market's reaction this time? Fresh hostility. Now, it is argued, the whole thing will drag on deep into next year, with Compass probably being forced to sell off the various hotel brands piecemeal. Shares in Compass fell another 1.25% yesterday to make a shocking 32% loss over the past six weeks. This appears to be a classic case of one-speed thinking in the City, where being in line with the consensus tends to be a greater prize than being right. Whatever Messrs Robinson and Mackay say, it is a safe bet that the two planned to sell the hotels business from the outset - the complexity of the overall merger dictating that this part of the grand plan would have to wait. It can also be assumed that the leaking of the Compass/Accor discussions was more damaging to the French group's negotiating position than to the British firm. Accor stock slumped on fears it would have to raise cash to complete what was likely to be a \u00a33bn deal. It is fair speculation that Compass received a number of 11th hour offers for the hotels once it became clear it was genuinely ready to sell. And it is not too much of a leap of faith to believe that Compass would only have allowed Accor to flounce away from the negotiating table if it were confident of achieving better value elsewhere. It has taken 10 years to turn Granada from a sprawling, underperforming wreck into two lean, well managed Footsie businesses. Griping now over whether the job is completed in two months or four months is plain crass. Void vision There it was, gone. Anglo-Swiss insurer Allied Zurich switched its primary share listing this week from Britain to Switzerland, becoming Zurich Financial from yesterday morning. But London's trading community did not receive their new shares. They could not trade and, in effect, this \u00a330bn European blue chip all but disappeared for a day. It was not immediately clear who was at fault, with the Crest settlement authorities in London blaming the Swiss. But the affair is another reminder that in an increasingly sophisticated international investment environment, Europe's trading and settlement infrastructure remains a long way short of adequate.",

      "bodyText": "Speculation about a possible profits warning from CMG dragged Misys shares 50.5p lower to 669.5p yesterday. The weakness could provide a good buying opportunity. While CMG was yesterday busy denying any problems, Misys was bringing an important sector of the financial services industry onside. Together with six ofBritain's leading insurers, Misys is planning a business-to-business internet portal that is expected generate several million pounds of transaction revenues. The new venture coincides with a growing feeling that demand in the banking sector is returning and earnings growth is likely to accelerate. Misys has called an analyst conference to talk about the issue next Friday and the message is expected to be a positive one. Morgan Stanley reckons Misys shares are worth 825p. Upward movement in the price seems likely.",

      "bodyText": "One year after being forced to postpone flotation plans amid a wave of investor scepticism, Regus, which runs business centres, was celebrating last night after finally making its stock market debut in London and New York. The bold decision to press ahead despite the recent market turbulence proved to be justified as the stock rose from its 260p-per-share offer price to close the day in London at 277p. City analysts expect the shares to surge even higher as the company, regarded as one of the fastest growing in Europe, continues its aggressive expansion plans. Most of the \u00a3235m raised in yesterday's flotation will be used to set up more business centres in the US. The company, set up 11 years ago by chief executive Mark Dixon, started off as one Brussels-based office catering for the city's stressed travelling executives. It now has 302 centres in 47 countries offering fully equipped office space, secretarial and technical support. Last year, institutional investors were questioning the company's financial strength and its ability to achieve expansion targets. These worries, it seems, have been banished by a strong performance, with revenues for 2000 predicted by management to be between \u00a3385m and \u00a3415m. \"The view is this is a real growth story,\" said one analyst. \"It's the sort of story investors are happy to buy into.\" Regus is by far the dominant force in a sector with just a handful of players, although more competitors are expected to emerge over the next couple of years. Its nearest rival, albeit unlisted, is US-based HQ Global Workplaces, while the smaller Servcorp of Australia is also on the scene. The company's business centre roll-out programme is not, however, totally free of problems. The costs associated with setting them up, such as finding sites and signing leases, are high and it can take many months before they make it into profit. It does bear many hallmarks of old economy companies, such as links to the property market, though it is not directly exposed to oil price volatility. The positive aspects, however, far outweigh the negative and this could well be a good addition to the portfolio. Buy.",

Rabin and Barak both dipped a toe in this water, and Israel's liberal intelligentsia have gone much further. But now Israelis themselves may have to dive in. Yesterday's Ha'aretz newspaper contained an extraordinary essay, all the more remarkable for being published in the current climate. In it sociologist Danny Rabinowitz adds to the current back-to- basics mood by suggesting Israel needs to reflect on its own birth in 1948 - and make amends. He urges his fellow countrymen to acknowledge at last that their state was created at the cost of tragedy and dispossession to another people. He suggests government memorials for the 400 Palestinian villages destroyed in 1948, proper care for ruined mosques and churches, an official memorial day for the Palestinian tragedy - even perhaps a change to Israel's national anthem and flag. What Rabinowitz, in common with Israel's \"new historians\", wants is for the Jewish state finally to see the other side: to recognise the Palestinians' history and understand their claim.</p> <p>I sraelis, of course, want the same thing. Among the ironies of the peace process is that, while one of the great sticking points was always Israeli recognition of a Palestinian state, it is Israel which desperately wants Palestinian recognition - of the Jewish state. It is a constant neurosis of the Israelis that their presence in the Middle East is not accepted as legitimate by their neighbours. They need to hear the Palestinian intelligentsia, if not Arafat himself, at least acknowledge that Israel has a right to exist - yes within smaller borders, yes with an end to occupation and brutality, yes with a policy of internal equality - but a right to exist.</p> <p>Yet such acceptance never comes. Until now, the best Israelis could hope for was a pragmatic recognition by Palestinians that there are 5m Jews in the region and they cannot be wished away. But that grudging, de facto acceptance has not been enough to make Israelis feel secure - and ready to forge a genuine peace with their neighbours.</p> <p>What Israelis, and indeed Jews around the world, need to hear is that Palestinians, and their supporters, recognise that Jews have a right to self-determination like every other people: the Scots, the Catalans, even the Palestinians themselves. Of course the tragic difference is that the territory designated by Jews as the stage for their self-determination already had another people living there. In an ideal world, the Jews would have gone somewhere else. But where? There was no land without a people for \"the people without a land\".</p> <p>Besides, much as the anti-Zionist absolutists refuse to see it, the Jews do have a millennia-old connection to that terrain. No matter what Hanan Ashrawi may say, Jews did not \"fabricate\" Joseph's Tomb. Nor is Haram al-Sharif important only to Muslims: it is also the site of the Jews' Second Temple. It would be easier if the claim was all on one side, as the Palestinian hardliners and Zionist right insist it is. But the truth is not so absolute.</p> <p>So maybe there's hope to be had in this current return to first principles. Maybe, through this argument, those outside the region will see that this is not a Wild West battle of cowboys and Indians, Zionist villains against Palestinian heroes, but a tragedy - pitting against each other two needy peoples, whose causes are both just. When both sides see each other that way, then maybe they will decide to share the land, not only because they have to - but because it is right.</p> <p>Contact: <a href=\"mailto:jonathanfreedland@theguardian.com\">jonathanfreedland@theguardian.com</a>.</p>",

Like Sharm el-Sheikh, the Red Sea resort where the crisis summit was held, the deal is built on sand. Nothing was written down, nothing signed, nor were any handshakes exchanged. All depends on implementation, and on mutual trust and goodwill, of which at present there is none.</p> <p>The participants of this forced, angry meeting, seething with resentment and grievance, at times simply substituted diplomatic stone-throwing for the pitched street battles of the past 20 days. For all Bill Clinton's patient, unctuous trauma counselling, for all his pious hopes of a return to the path of peace, this cold fury remains undispelled.

      "bodyText": "The agreement to halt the latest round of Israeli-Palestinian violence, grudgingly and gracelessly accepted by the two sides yesterday after intense American arm-twisting, is as fragile as a gossamer thread on a windy autumn's day, and possibly just as transient. Like Sharm el-Sheikh, the Red Sea resort where the crisis summit was held, the deal is built on sand. Nothing was written down, nothing signed, nor were any handshakes exchanged. All depends on implementation, and on mutual trust and goodwill, of which at present there is none. The participants of this forced, angry meeting, seething with resentment and grievance, at times simply substituted diplomatic stone-throwing for the pitched street battles of the past 20 days. For all Bill Clinton's patient, unctuous trauma counselling, for all his pious hopes of a return to the path of peace, this cold fury remains undispelled. Its root causes, Mr Clinton's specious fact-finding committee to one side, remain unaddressed. Its future, unpredictable expression, sparked perhaps by another child killing, another lynching, or by a marketplace bomb, may swiftly destroy all tentative hope of rapprochement. For even as Mr Clinton headed back to Washington for the funerals of US sailors killed by the new intifada's sympathisers in Yemen, blood was flowing again in occupied Palestine and, on both sides of the divide, the deadly dance resumed.

Mukut Mithi, the chief minister of the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, said that Chinese army patrols had been crossing mountain terrain there and harassing villagers. The disputed 650-mile border in India's north-east, known as the Line of Actual Control (LAC), has long been a flashpoint between the two nuclear powers which fought a border war there in 1962.

      "bodyText": "Your report ('Explosive' NHS plans revealed, October 17) speculating that the Institute for Public Policy Research may propose the privatisation of NHS management, is a product of successive governments failing to invest in training and IT systems which leave many managers, unsurprisingly, poorly equipped to deal with change. To believe naively that the private sector can do better is silly: their managers, just like NHS bureaucrats, can be remote, rude and unaccountable as anyone who has grappled with insurance, bank and other private sector bureaucracies can vouch. Like the private finance initiative, this proposal at worst will be a stupid hangover from monetarism and unsubstantiated faith in the private sector. At best it may make the government realise that its ambitious and overdue programme of NHS reform requires investment to ensure excellence in management systems and performance. That would be a welcome change to the current approach, which uses barely disguised threats of retribution to \"encourage\" the NHS troops. Prof Alan Maynard University of York akm3@york.ac.uk \u0095 Faced with the latest business-obsessed proposals from the IPPR, I wonder which aspect of New Labour and its satellites is the more worrying. Is it the astonishing naivety of those academics, party members and MPs who have no experience whatsoever of the realities of the commercial world, or is it the influence of the cleverer figures who do?

      "body": "<p>From 1959, until his death aged 90, Gus Hall was secretary-general of the Communist party of the United States. During that time, the once-powerful organisation passed, remarkably unchanged, through social struggle and reaction, isolated but rarely threatened by the internal turmoil which shattered so many of its counterparts. Hall's rigidity kept American communists simultaneously faithful to eastern bloc-style state socialism - even in its absence - and to the Democratic party.</p> <p>Born Arvo Halberg in Iron, Minnesota, one of the nine children of a Finnish-American mining family which supported the Industrial Workers of the World - the Wobblies - he left school at 14 and became a lumber worker. His blacklisted father was a founding CPUSA member.</p> <p>In 1927, Arvo (renamed Gus Hall in the 1930s as part of \"Americanising\" communism) joined the young communist league. He spent two years at Moscow's Lenin Institute, organised the unemployed at home, and, in 1937, was charged with attempted dynamiting of a steel plant - rivals later considered his escape from prosecution suspicious. He then became a full-time communist.</p> <p>After naval service in the second world war, Hall joined the CPUSA national executive in 1945. In 1948, he was convicted of conspiring to overthrow the government by force. Sentenced to five years' imprisonment, he became a model party leader, absent from duty but unflinching in the face of persecution. Thus his arrest in 1951, for jumping bail and seeking political exile in Mexico, added years to his sentence - and credibility to his status.</p> <p>Hall emerged from prison in 1957 into a ghostly remnant of his party, which had peaked during wartime with 85,000 members, a popular following perhaps 10 times that size, and influence from Hollywood to the civil rights and industrial union movements. Legislative repression and FBI pursuit had narrowed the party, but disillusionment had nearly erased it.

      "bodyText": "From 1959, until his death aged 90, Gus Hall was secretary-general of the Communist party of the United States. During that time, the once-powerful organisation passed, remarkably unchanged, through social struggle and reaction, isolated but rarely threatened by the internal turmoil which shattered so many of its counterparts. Hall's rigidity kept American communists simultaneously faithful to eastern bloc-style state socialism - even in its absence - and to the Democratic party. Born Arvo Halberg in Iron, Minnesota, one of the nine children of a Finnish-American mining family which supported the Industrial Workers of the World - the Wobblies - he left school at 14 and became a lumber worker. His blacklisted father was a founding CPUSA member. In 1927, Arvo (renamed Gus Hall in the 1930s as part of \"Americanising\" communism) joined the young communist league. He spent two years at Moscow's Lenin Institute, organised the unemployed at home, and, in 1937, was charged with attempted dynamiting of a steel plant - rivals later considered his escape from prosecution suspicious. He then became a full-time communist. After naval service in the second world war, Hall joined the CPUSA national executive in 1945. In 1948, he was convicted of conspiring to overthrow the government by force. Sentenced to five years' imprisonment, he became a model party leader, absent from duty but unflinching in the face of persecution. Thus his arrest in 1951, for jumping bail and seeking political exile in Mexico, added years to his sentence - and credibility to his status. Hall emerged from prison in 1957 into a ghostly remnant of his party, which had peaked during wartime with 85,000 members, a popular following perhaps 10 times that size, and influence from Hollywood to the civil rights and industrial union movements. Legislative repression and FBI pursuit had narrowed the party, but disillusionment had nearly erased it. In 1956, rebellion in Hungary, and Nikita Khrushchev's revelations of Russian anti-semitism, had demoralised survivors. A reform wing of the organisation argued for openness and internal democracy, but the hardliners outlasted their opponents, thus preparing the way for the Gus Hall era. Yet Hall apparently promised to take advantage of new winds from the civil rights, peace and labour movements. Taking power, he asserted a tone that never again left the CPUSA. Further threats of federal persecution seemingly legitimised his military-style posture. But so did the conspiratorial character of American responses to post-colonial developments, from the Caribbean and Latin America to Africa and Asia. Russian support for Fidel Castro, in particular, but also of many new regimes and guerilla movements, gave the Soviet Union its last measure of support from younger generations, and American communists an element of reflected glory. Hall set the communists apart from the emerging new left, quite as much through cultural conservatism as through their undying faith in Moscow. The mostly middle-aged (or older) communists, including Hall, were morally offended by campus activists' sexual politics and drug use. But they also opposed breaking with the Democrats, and celebrated Lyndon Johnson's crushing 1964 defeat of Barry Goldwater as a \"people's victory\". They opposed the black power slogan as divisive. Highly influential in antiwar mobilisations in Manhattan, and enjoying a modest resurgence in selected unions and some African-American causes, communists nevertheless recruited few youngsters until the new left's collapse. Thereafter, the election of African-American mayors in Chicago, Detroit and Berkeley - with decades-long personal ties to local communists - symptomised the prospects for revival.

      "body": "<p>John Laredo, who has died unexpectedly in Leeds aged 68, was one of a distinguished band of Afrikaner intellectuals, including Bram Fischer, Breyten Breyteinbach and Marius Schoon, whose rebellion against the white supremacist doctrines of apartheid led to their imprisonment.</p> <p>After the 1960 Sharpeville massacre, and the ensuing repression, armed struggle seemed to many radicals an inevitability. The African Resistance Movement, formed by a mixture of liberals and socialists, undertook numerous acts of sabotage from December 1961 to mid-1964, when the special branch broke the organisation and imprisoned a score of people, most of them young and white.</p> <p>That Laredo, then head of social anthropology at Rhodes University, Port Elizabeth - and a naturally gentle, easygoing and law-abiding man - should have joined such a group can best be explained by his instinctive egalitarianism and loathing of injustice. These were qualities recognised by his pro-regime mother, who said to him during a prison visit: \"I cannot agree with your actions, but the Haaroffs [her maiden name] were always rebels and I know you've done what you believe to be right.\"</p> <p>Detained and interrogated for 110 days, under the \"90-day\" detention clause, Laredo was jailed for five years after refusing to give evidence against his comrades. In the notorious Pretoria local prison, he was a resolute and and cheerful companion. His ability to find common ground was crucial in furthering solidarity between communists and non-communists.</p> <p>Laredo was born in Pretoria. His mother was related to a former president of the Free State Republic and his father was a civil servant. His home language was Afrikaans, but he spoke English impeccably - possibly because his mother had insisted, \"If you must speak the enemy's language, be sure to speak it better than they do\". He later learned Zulu and several other European languages.</p> <p>In 1951, Laredo went to Stellenbosch University, that incubator of so many Afrikaner nationalist theorists. Ironically, while majoring in history and native administration, he began to analyse the factors causing black poverty and subjugation - and concluded that white hegemony was to blame.

      "bodyText": "John Laredo, who has died unexpectedly in Leeds aged 68, was one of a distinguished band of Afrikaner intellectuals, including Bram Fischer, Breyten Breyteinbach and Marius Schoon, whose rebellion against the white supremacist doctrines of apartheid led to their imprisonment. After the 1960 Sharpeville massacre, and the ensuing repression, armed struggle seemed to many radicals an inevitability. The African Resistance Movement, formed by a mixture of liberals and socialists, undertook numerous acts of sabotage from December 1961 to mid-1964, when the special branch broke the organisation and imprisoned a score of people, most of them young and white. That Laredo, then head of social anthropology at Rhodes University, Port Elizabeth - and a naturally gentle, easygoing and law-abiding man - should have joined such a group can best be explained by his instinctive egalitarianism and loathing of injustice. These were qualities recognised by his pro-regime mother, who said to him during a prison visit: \"I cannot agree with your actions, but the Haaroffs [her maiden name] were always rebels and I know you've done what you believe to be right.\" Detained and interrogated for 110 days, under the \"90-day\" detention clause, Laredo was jailed for five years after refusing to give evidence against his comrades. In the notorious Pretoria local prison, he was a resolute and and cheerful companion. His ability to find common ground was crucial in furthering solidarity between communists and non-communists. Laredo was born in Pretoria. His mother was related to a former president of the Free State Republic and his father was a civil servant. His home language was Afrikaans, but he spoke English impeccably - possibly because his mother had insisted, \"If you must speak the enemy's language, be sure to speak it better than they do\". He later learned Zulu and several other European languages. In 1951, Laredo went to Stellenbosch University, that incubator of so many Afrikaner nationalist theorists. Ironically, while majoring in history and native administration, he began to analyse the factors causing black poverty and subjugation - and concluded that white hegemony was to blame. Reading for a master's in social anthropology at King's College, Cambridge, between 1955 and 1957, completed his conversion to socialism. While in Britain, Laredo married Ursula Marx, another brilliant Stellenbosch graduate, returning in 1958 to South Africa, where their daughter and two sons were born. After lecturing in African studies at Cape Town University, he moved to Durban in 1959 to undertake anthropological fieldwork in kwaZulu at Natal University, where he subsequently became a sociology lecturer. In Natal, the Laredos joined Alan Paton's Liberal party and participated in peaceful demonstrations and anti-apartheid teach-ins. Their home became an informal locus where young South Africans - whatever their colour - could talk politics. On one legendary occasion, a somewhat xenophobic Laredo aunt arrived unexpectedly in the middle of a debate. Offered a chair by a black man, she vigorously dusted it with her handkerchief before sitting down. In 1963, John took charge of social anthropology at Rhodes, while continuing his fieldwork. This should have led to a distinguished PhD and a secure place in the academic community, had the secret police not intervened. After his release from prison, with his career shattered by banning orders and house arrest, Laredo came into exile in Britain. From 1970-71, he was resident visiting fellow at his old Cambridge college. He then joined the new Bradford University's sociology department, until a heart attack in 1990, and further illnesses, prompted him to retire in 1993.

We are more likely to be assaulted by the phrase \"more bobbies on the beat\" than at any time in the past 20 years and millions now live in fear of the trauma of waking up to discover that Jack Straw is talking on the Today programme.</p> <p>Meanwhile the British Crime Survey has actually revealed that crime itself is going down. There are fewer burglaries, except in the areas where people keep leaving the house to attend Neighbourhood Watch meetings. There is a reduction in motor vehicle crime which is attributed to car alarms, while the increase in parked cars being attacked with a sledgehammer in the middle of the night is also attributed to car alarms. Apparently we are more likely to be robbed and assaulted by strangers, but this is hardly surprising - if you are going to mug someone you would have to be pretty stupid to try it out on your best friend.</p> <p>Ann Widdecombe will be disappointed that the crime figures have fallen, despite all the efforts of her Conservative colleagues in getting themselves arrested on a regular basis. One of the few perks of being shadow home secretary is being able to point to the inexorable rise in recorded offences and using this to attack your opponent. But now, as she peeks out from behind her net curtains, she will realise that she too has been the victim of a crime.

      "bodyText": "Politicians from all sides have been discussing the new crime figures this week and the statistics make depressing reading. When talking about action against burglars, use of the word \"tough\" has increased 57%. When referring to violent crime, the incidence of politicians saying \"tough\" has gone up by a massive 71%. We are more likely to be assaulted by the phrase \"more bobbies on the beat\" than at any time in the past 20 years and millions now live in fear of the trauma of waking up to discover that Jack Straw is talking on the Today programme. Meanwhile the British Crime Survey has actually revealed that crime itself is going down. There are fewer burglaries, except in the areas where people keep leaving the house to attend Neighbourhood Watch meetings. There is a reduction in motor vehicle crime which is attributed to car alarms, while the increase in parked cars being attacked with a sledgehammer in the middle of the night is also attributed to car alarms. Apparently we are more likely to be robbed and assaulted by strangers, but this is hardly surprising - if you are going to mug someone you would have to be pretty stupid to try it out on your best friend. Ann Widdecombe will be disappointed that the crime figures have fallen, despite all the efforts of her Conservative colleagues in getting themselves arrested on a regular basis. One of the few perks of being shadow home secretary is being able to point to the inexorable rise in recorded offences and using this to attack your opponent. But now, as she peeks out from behind her net curtains, she will realise that she too has been the victim of a crime. When it comes to the law and order issue, Labour have stolen the Tories' clothes (although the image of Jack Straw in one of Ann Widdecombe's dresses is not something you'd want to dwell upon). While Ann's own pronouncements are greeted with stoned giggles from her colleagues in the shadow cabinet, Labour can point to solid social and economic policies that have helped bring crime down.

      "body": "<p>More than 350 people have died in Vietnam's worst floods for 70 years. Most of the victims are young children who drowned while left unattended by their parents. </p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of people in the Mekong delta in southern Vietnam have been forced to flee their homes, and water levels are so high that they will not be able to return until December. </p> <p>Last week the floodwaters receded for the first time since July. But a new wave of sustained, heavy rain has pushed levels back up again to the point where the country's commercial capital, Ho Chi Minh City, could find itself inundated. \"The flood is now reaching provinces where people are not used to seeing something on this scale,\" said Peter Michelson who is coordinating the Red Cross's relief effort in the delta. </p> <p>Those whose homes have been submerged are living on small, muddy dykes in squalid, unhygienic conditions. Many have run out of food and rely on relief workers to bring in supplies. </p> <p>Hunger and disease are not the only dangers. A number of crocodiles - not normally seen in the Mekong delta - have appeared in the floodwaters. It is believed that they were washed downstream from Cambodia or escaped from crocodile farms in Vietnam. </p> <p>There is also a plague of golden snails which are breeding rapidly in the flood water. Farmers have reported seeing millions of snails' eggs. It is feared the snails will eat any rice crops that survive the flood. In the past the authorities have had to organise communal, mass culls of the snails to protect agricultural land. </p> <p>Every year floods in the south cause disruption, but this time things are far worse. And in central Vietnam heavy monsoon rains have caused devastating floods for the last three years. So far this month, more than 50 people have died in flash floods well away from the Mekong. Some environmentalists believe east Asia's weather patterns are becoming increasingly extreme and dangerous. </p> <p>\"There's a lot more rain falling in less time. Overall the amount of rainfall isn't changing but it's coming down in very intense short bursts,\" said the UN's environment adviser in Hanoi, Craig Leisher. </p> <p>But the problem is also manmade. The Mekong river starts in China and flows through Laos, Thailand and Cambodia before reaching southern Vietnam. All along its course, forests are being cut down, reducing the land's capacity to retain water. Downstream, the people of the delta are on the receiving end of the more extreme floods that result. </p> <p>The Vietnamese authorities have tried to clamp down on illegal logging but with limited success. \"Some cases have gone to court. Even so, deforestation has still happened. Some poor people still cut down trees. They need the money to make a living,\" said Nguyen Tuy Nien, director of flood control and dyke management. </p> <p>Local newspapers have reported that there have been more than 39,000 violations of forestry regulations so far this year. Illegal loggers are turning violent when challenged by forest rangers. </p> <p>Other modern practices, such as creating concrete river banks so buildings can be put up near the Mekong, contribute to the volume of water arriving downstream. And it is feared that increased damming of the river - especially in China and Laos - could compound the problem. When reservoirs fill up, dam managers release vast amounts of water, adding to the difficulties downstream. </p> <p>The Vietnamese government says it wants people to live with floods rather than escape them. In recent years the authorities have extended small loans so families can build their houses on stilts. Thousands of wooden boats have been distributed so that flood victims can fish for their own food rather than rely on aid agencies. Effective early warning systems have been installed; without them many more people would have died. </p> <p>But such initiatives cannot hide the fact that the number of people vulnerable to flooding is increasing. \"More and more people are living in the delta, closer to the banks,\" said Koos Neefjes of Oxfam. \"These very poor people need to fish; they need to live on the river banks.\" </p> <p>Vietnam is one of the most densely populated countries in Asia. By implementing a policy of trying to limit children to two per family, the government is said now to have largely controlled population growth. That will ease the situation in the future but for the present, there is still great pressure on marginal land as people try to find somewhere to make a living. </p> <p>The increasing numbers in the Mekong delta have resulted in new agricultural practices. The type of rice, for example, traditionally grown there can withstand most floods because it floats. But popular new strains, while more productive, cannot survive a long flood and much of this year's crop has been lost.</p>",

Hunger and disease are not the only dangers. A number of crocodiles - not normally seen in the Mekong delta - have appeared in the floodwaters. It is believed that they were washed downstream from Cambodia or escaped from crocodile farms in Vietnam. There is also a plague of golden snails which are breeding rapidly in the flood water. Farmers have reported seeing millions of snails' eggs. It is feared the snails will eat any rice crops that survive the flood. In the past the authorities have had to organise communal, mass culls of the snails to protect agricultural land. Every year floods in the south cause disruption, but this time things are far worse. And in central Vietnam heavy monsoon rains have caused devastating floods for the last three years. So far this month, more than 50 people have died in flash floods well away from the Mekong. Some environmentalists believe east Asia's weather patterns are becoming increasingly extreme and dangerous. \"There's a lot more rain falling in less time. Overall the amount of rainfall isn't changing but it's coming down in very intense short bursts,\" said the UN's environment adviser in Hanoi, Craig Leisher. But the problem is also manmade. The Mekong river starts in China and flows through Laos, Thailand and Cambodia before reaching southern Vietnam. All along its course, forests are being cut down, reducing the land's capacity to retain water. Downstream, the people of the delta are on the receiving end of the more extreme floods that result. The Vietnamese authorities have tried to clamp down on illegal logging but with limited success. \"Some cases have gone to court. Even so, deforestation has still happened. Some poor people still cut down trees. They need the money to make a living,\" said Nguyen Tuy Nien, director of flood control and dyke management. Local newspapers have reported that there have been more than 39,000 violations of forestry regulations so far this year. Illegal loggers are turning violent when challenged by forest rangers. Other modern practices, such as creating concrete river banks so buildings can be put up near the Mekong, contribute to the volume of water arriving downstream. And it is feared that increased damming of the river - especially in China and Laos - could compound the problem. When reservoirs fill up, dam managers release vast amounts of water, adding to the difficulties downstream. The Vietnamese government says it wants people to live with floods rather than escape them. In recent years the authorities have extended small loans so families can build their houses on stilts. Thousands of wooden boats have been distributed so that flood victims can fish for their own food rather than rely on aid agencies. Effective early warning systems have been installed; without them many more people would have died. But such initiatives cannot hide the fact that the number of people vulnerable to flooding is increasing. \"More and more people are living in the delta, closer to the banks,\" said Koos Neefjes of Oxfam. \"These very poor people need to fish; they need to live on the river banks.\" Vietnam is one of the most densely populated countries in Asia. By implementing a policy of trying to limit children to two per family, the government is said now to have largely controlled population growth. That will ease the situation in the future but for the present, there is still great pressure on marginal land as people try to find somewhere to make a living. The increasing numbers in the Mekong delta have resulted in new agricultural practices. The type of rice, for example, traditionally grown there can withstand most floods because it floats. But popular new strains, while more productive, cannot survive a long flood and much of this year's crop has been lost.",

If his peers, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash, can enjoy late-career respectability, Merle Haggard is determined that his time should come again. </p> <p>Best known for Okie from Muskogee, Haggard had a run of 65 hits on the country charts in the 19 years leading up to 1985. But he is rather more self-destructive, distrustful of the music industry, success and maybe even himself than today's crop of sanitised country-lite stars. And while Nashville honours its elders as an exercise in self-validation, that doesn't mean it wants to hear too much from them. </p> <p>When Haggard was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1994, he appeared on the stage, live on network television, with a roll of paper containing the names of those he said he must thank. \"First of all,\" he said after unfurling the roll, \"I'd like to thank Andy Gump, my plumber. You're doing a great job keeping my toilets working, Andy.\" </p> <p>The songwriter whose work has earned him soubriquets such as the Poet of the Common Man - Today I Started Loving You Again, for one, has been recorded by 400 artists - wants recognition, but only on his own terms. Haggard arrived at the conclusion that no record company would allow him to make the record he wanted, so he opted out for four years, though he continued to play about 150 shows every year. Then he hooked up with Anti Records, a subsidiary of Epitaph, the label that nurtures Rancid, Voodoo Glow Skulls, the Offspring and Midget Handjob. </p> <p>Haggard cannot stop saying how glad he is to be on a punk label at last. The match is not as odd as it might seem, given that Anti is designed to dovetail with substantial artists from outside the mainstream: Tom Waits had the biggest-selling record of his career when Anti released Mule Variations last year. </p> <p>The singer has, however, spurned other chances to give a new focus to his career. When Nelson, Cash, Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson formed the Outlaws in an exercise designed to capitalise on their distance from the Nashville establishment, Haggard was invited to join in. \"It got to be a cool thing to be considered a part of the outlaw community,\" he says. \"They offered to expand it to five people. I didn't have time and the pie was too thin.\" </p> <p>Instead, Nelson extended his audience by recording the arty Teatro with the producer Daniel Lanois. Cash achieved the same effect by reducing his music to its essence on American Recordings. Haggard's pitch to follow suit came with the release of If I Could Only Fly. Its arrangements are lightly adorned, all the instruments at the service of his genre-defining voice, the model of authority and controlled emotion. There's no need to ask who the songs are about: there is no third person in evidence here. His life is the original handbook for many of the country staples: poor childhood, father dead when he was nine, prison for burglary as a young man, divorces, drink and drugs. Haggard once told Johnny Cash how much he'd enjoyed a concert at San Quentin prison, in California. Cash said he didn't remember Haggard on the stage; that, said Haggard, was because he wasn't on the bill, but in the audience. </p> <p>Haggard is a hero to the alternative country crowd, many of whose members tipped their hats to him six years ago on Tulare Dust, a successful tribute album. But he's not bothered about any of that. \"I don't pay much attention to records any more. I like to see people sit down with a piano or a guitar. I still listen to [honky tonk man] Lefty Frizzell and Hank Williams. I don't believe anyone's ever outdone Lefty.\" </p> <p>Although he's pleased with his new record, he has reservations about its likely fate. \"This is my last hurrah,\" he says. \"I think people are dying to see a high wire act without a net.\" At this point he mentions Hank Williams again. Later he will include John Wayne and James Dean among the individuals who have dared to put their talents on the line. </p> <p>Haggard is appearing on David Letterman's TV show the following night but he is not a-quiver with anticipation. \"He's not going to give me couch time.\" But at least he's on the show. \"I guess somebody gives a shit.\" But there are other opportunities, even if they stopped playing authentic country on the radio years ago. \"The video will probably not be played anywhere,\" he says. \"They're not going to play me when they can play those good-looking girls. I don't blame them. Some old guy like me isn't going to take the spotlight away from them. But I'd like to sell records again.\" </p> <p>One record that he did sell, effortlessly and controversially in 1969, was Okie from Muskogee, the most eloquent of redneck anthems and the song with which he will always be most readily associated. The song's rejection of the prevailing cultural forces in the 60s - leftish values and hippie ideals at the pinnacle of the Vietnam war - can be taken on a number of levels, and Haggard recommends that it is. Predominant among these, though, is his persistent defence of ordinary blue-collar people. </p> <p>At Haggard's live show at New York's Irving Plaza that night, Okie receives the biggest cheer. Here, as the audience celebrate their lives vicariously through his short-story songs, Haggard is enjoying himself with his outstanding band, the Strangers. And from the album that Haggard says will determine the course of a near-40 year career, he plays just one song. </p> <p>If I Could Only Fly is on Anti Records.</p>",

Haggard is appearing on David Letterman's TV show the following night but he is not a-quiver with anticipation. \"He's not going to give me couch time.\" But at least he's on the show. \"I guess somebody gives a shit.\" But there are other opportunities, even if they stopped playing authentic country on the radio years ago. \"The video will probably not be played anywhere,\" he says. \"They're not going to play me when they can play those good-looking girls. I don't blame them. Some old guy like me isn't going to take the spotlight away from them. But I'd like to sell records again.\" One record that he did sell, effortlessly and controversially in 1969, was Okie from Muskogee, the most eloquent of redneck anthems and the song with which he will always be most readily associated. The song's rejection of the prevailing cultural forces in the 60s - leftish values and hippie ideals at the pinnacle of the Vietnam war - can be taken on a number of levels, and Haggard recommends that it is. Predominant among these, though, is his persistent defence of ordinary blue-collar people. At Haggard's live show at New York's Irving Plaza that night, Okie receives the biggest cheer. Here, as the audience celebrate their lives vicariously through his short-story songs, Haggard is enjoying himself with his outstanding band, the Strangers. And from the album that Haggard says will determine the course of a near-40 year career, he plays just one song. If I Could Only Fly is on Anti Records.",

It's awful.\" </p> <p>British composers Michael Nyman and Orlando Gough have, fortunately, had happier dealings in the world of dance - and, as with many composers, their new work has sometimes appeared thanks to the support of choreographers. Dance is one of the most important platforms for new music, since it commissions so many scores. Even Debussy's Jeux would never have seen the light of day had it not been created for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. </p> <p>Gough admits that dance has been \"a lifeline\" in his own composing career and, while Nyman may reach a wider public through his film music, he too has had reason to be grateful. It is not just that choreographers, as he points out, \"bugger the music around\" less than film directors, but that certain dance collaborations have inspired him to create work he would otherwise never have made. </p> <p>But watching their scores paired with bad dancing can be excruciating. \"It makes the music sound incredibly annoying and grating,\" Gough says. When pushed, both composers confess to having been as disconcerted as Debussy by the maths of some of their collaborators. \"You give these choreographers a beat and then they don't even dance to it,\" they say. </p> <p>Gough and Nyman haven't crossed paths since 1976, when they were members of a mildly anarchic group of composer-pianists called Five Pianos. They have, though, composed music for several of the same dance artists and, when I got them together to compare notes, they admitted to feeling that choreographers sometimes speak a different language from musicians. </p> <p>Nyman confesses that he is \"a sort of literalist\" when it comes to dance, and has a hard time accepting that choreographers rarely simply shadow musical structures. One of his earliest dance collaborations was with the Royal Ballet's Ashley Page. \"I gave Ashley all this stuff with very fixed beats but I never saw the dancers placing their feet where the music placed its feet, so to speak. It was either very perverse or very brilliant.\" Gough has also worked with Page but thinks that he is far more responsive to musical beat than most. \"If you give Ashley a beat he's a happy man. He hears beats in anything.\" </p> <p>Certainly Page has always stuck far closer to the logic of Gough's music than, for instance Ian Spink (choreographer of the now defunct Second Stride). \"In some of the pieces Spink and I worked on there'd be really serious friction,\" recalls Gough. \"The music and dance would be rubbing against each other in ways that could seem totally arbitrary. I'd be wondering what on earth he was doing.\" </p> <p>But then Gough isn't sure that absolute faithfulness to music is the right solution, either. He remembers that the first piece he saw by Mark Morris made him think: \"Gosh, how flattering to the composer. Every single movement in the dance seemed to be imitating something in the music. But after a while it seemed too much of a tautology. There wasn't any friction between the music and the dance.\" Gough's collaborations with Spink may have been more abrasive but there were times when the collision of their separate ideas produced dazzling sparks. \"We had moments that were utter genius,\" he says. </p> <p>Siobhan Davies also tends to regard music and dance as independent entities but both Gough and Nyman have found her sensitive to the overall structure of their work. She may find her own vision in the music but it flatters, rather than hijacks, the score. Gough doesn't know how this happens but is enchanted by it. When he set out to compose for Davies's Of Oil and Water, which opens at Sadler's Wells in London tonight, he had been alarmed by the nebulousness of their common ground. \"The ideas we had discussed were pretty intangible,\" he says. However, when he saw the piece in the theatre he realised that some new entity had been created, which he felt was all the more powerful for being impossible to describe. </p> <p>Nyman agrees that good choreography can have a magically gratifying effect on the way he hears his own music. The first time he saw Stephen Petronio's new work together with his own score, he was mesmerised by \"the different sense of time it gave me. There's a really interesting tension between the pace of the movement and the grouping of the bodies in relation to the music's rather stolid beat. When the choreography is strong enough to go against the plotting of the music the music flows and breaks out of itself. I can forget what I originally did and get transported.\" </p> <p>Do they mind that the dancing usually takes precedence over their music in the theatre? It's not just that audiences tend to buy their tickets with the choreographer in mind, but that once inside the theatre, what they see on stage probably registers more powerfully than what they hear.

We can do lots of things with this facility.\" The Longbridge engine plant delivers 70% of its annual output of about 200,000 units to MG Rover and the rest to Land Rover, now owned by Ford. But Prof S\u00e4mann said reports that a deal would be concluded by Christmas were wide of the mark. \"There are several renowned international companies who are interested in the business and with whom we are negotiating. Phoenix is just one of them.\" BMW officials said the German group was negotiating with \"less than a handful\" of would-be buyers and did not expect a result for several months. Ford, which is not interested in buying the plant, is thought to be reluctant to see it pass into MG Rover's hands.",

You could say that all English drama is about class to some degree, but I don't think North Square is about class predominantly: it's about law, and how it is applied. That's what is really interesting: in one scenario a woman loses her children and it's tragic, in another some nutter is stealing underpants and it's comic; that's much more like real life, with a tragedy tumbling over a comedy. Plus the career side of it: you're hoping for a plea on Monday so you can do the big fraud on Tuesday. Of course it goes on.\" </p> <p>This is hardly the first time Davis has talked about class. Having appeared in The Who's mod melodrama Quadrophenia and worked with Alan Clarke on The Firm, he is part of the Ray Winstone/Phil Daniels generation of working-class actors so neglected during the 80s.

But the directors of the Mus\u00e9es de France said that the individual had insisted on preserving his anonymity.</p> <p>So far, only a regional French newspaper, La Provence, has dared to suggest that the donor was Philippe Meyer, son of the founder of Lazard Fr\u00e8res bank in New York, and a noted supporter of the arts.</p> <p>Mr Meyer helped the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay purchase Manet's Portrait of Berthe Morisot with a Bouquet of Violets in 1998.</p> <p>However, for many critics and art lovers at the Parisian gallery yesterday, the identity of the donor did not matter. Rather, what made their hearts swell with patriotic pride was the fact that many of the paintings - including some C\u00e9zannes and Fantin-Latours, a Chardin, a Degas, a Monet, a Manet, a Matisse and a post-cubist Leger - had been returned to their native land.</p> <p>\"Our donor acquired practically all of his collection in Switzerland, the United States and England, and brought back these masterpieces to their own country,\" said Fran\u00e7oise Cachin of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. \"Knowing that import tax is extremely high [5% of the value of each work in France] gives us another reason for saluting his generosity.\"</p> <p>But Ms Cachin was not prepared to say how much the collection was worth - at least not in vulgar money terms. \"The remarkable thing about the collection is that it is composed of recent acquisitions - nearly all of them were bought in the past 20 years,\" she said.</p> <p>The collection's highlights include C\u00e9zanne's Five Bathers, Degas's Chez la Modiste and Manet's Flowers in a Crystal Vase.</p> <p>Many of the works are not French, however. Indeed, the title of the display, From C\u00e9zanne to Giacometti (which runs at the gallery on the Left Bank until November 19), gives that fact away.</p> <p>Along with 17 Giacomettis, a Klee, a Schwitters, and a Mondrian, the collection includes 20 paintings by Tal Coat, an associate of Picasso. After the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay show has come to a close, much of the collection is to be dispersed throughout France.</p> <p>Fifty-seven works will stay in Paris, but the rest will go to Grenoble, Rennes, Quimper, and the Granet Museum in Aix-en-Provence. In the course of the past 15 years, the donor of these works has helped French art galleries acquire works by Renoir, Degas, Whistler, Bonnard and Moreau.</p>",

So far, only a regional French newspaper, La Provence, has dared to suggest that the donor was Philippe Meyer, son of the founder of Lazard Fr\u00e8res bank in New York, and a noted supporter of the arts. Mr Meyer helped the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay purchase Manet's Portrait of Berthe Morisot with a Bouquet of Violets in 1998. However, for many critics and art lovers at the Parisian gallery yesterday, the identity of the donor did not matter. Rather, what made their hearts swell with patriotic pride was the fact that many of the paintings - including some C\u00e9zannes and Fantin-Latours, a Chardin, a Degas, a Monet, a Manet, a Matisse and a post-cubist Leger - had been returned to their native land. \"Our donor acquired practically all of his collection in Switzerland, the United States and England, and brought back these masterpieces to their own country,\" said Fran\u00e7oise Cachin of the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. \"Knowing that import tax is extremely high [5% of the value of each work in France] gives us another reason for saluting his generosity.\" But Ms Cachin was not prepared to say how much the collection was worth - at least not in vulgar money terms. \"The remarkable thing about the collection is that it is composed of recent acquisitions - nearly all of them were bought in the past 20 years,\" she said. The collection's highlights include C\u00e9zanne's Five Bathers, Degas's Chez la Modiste and Manet's Flowers in a Crystal Vase. Many of the works are not French, however. Indeed, the title of the display, From C\u00e9zanne to Giacometti (which runs at the gallery on the Left Bank until November 19), gives that fact away. Along with 17 Giacomettis, a Klee, a Schwitters, and a Mondrian, the collection includes 20 paintings by Tal Coat, an associate of Picasso. After the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay show has come to a close, much of the collection is to be dispersed throughout France. Fifty-seven works will stay in Paris, but the rest will go to Grenoble, Rennes, Quimper, and the Granet Museum in Aix-en-Provence. In the course of the past 15 years, the donor of these works has helped French art galleries acquire works by Renoir, Degas, Whistler, Bonnard and Moreau.",

Until five years ago, no charity in Powys had taken on the role of providing the household needs of people in rural mid-Wales who were on low incomes or receiving benefits.

With some 14 councils, led by Birmingham, preparing to hold mayoral referendums - and a string of others poised to join them - all the signs now point to a \"national democracy day\" in 12 months' time. </p> <p>The idea is to co-ordinate up to 30 mayoral referendums next October to test popular support for an elected first citizen - with full-blown mayoral polls coinciding with local elections in May 2002. </p> <p>This comes as key members of the New Local Government Network, a pressure group close to Downing Street, publish the results of a lengthy research project which urges the government to be far bolder in giving councils more powers and responsibilities - and argues that policies imposed from the top without local support often fail. Significantly some of the findings of the project, Towards a New Localism, which will be discussed at a conference in London tomorrow, follow the Guardian's own agenda for local democracy, published last month in its alternative election manifesto. </p> <p>The network says that the mayoral debate should light the spark for a much wider reform process, with councils developing into the champions of their areas by assuming a wider leadership role embracing the economic and social health of communities.

      "bodyText": "Ministers pushing the case for radical reform of town and county halls think their campaign to create a network of elected executive mayors in England after the next general election is finally paying off. With some 14 councils, led by Birmingham, preparing to hold mayoral referendums - and a string of others poised to join them - all the signs now point to a \"national democracy day\" in 12 months' time. The idea is to co-ordinate up to 30 mayoral referendums next October to test popular support for an elected first citizen - with full-blown mayoral polls coinciding with local elections in May 2002. This comes as key members of the New Local Government Network, a pressure group close to Downing Street, publish the results of a lengthy research project which urges the government to be far bolder in giving councils more powers and responsibilities - and argues that policies imposed from the top without local support often fail. Significantly some of the findings of the project, Towards a New Localism, which will be discussed at a conference in London tomorrow, follow the Guardian's own agenda for local democracy, published last month in its alternative election manifesto. The network says that the mayoral debate should light the spark for a much wider reform process, with councils developing into the champions of their areas by assuming a wider leadership role embracing the economic and social health of communities. It attacks the excessive centralism of Whitehall and calls for a new system of five-year \"partnership compacts\", drawn up between town halls and all local stakeholders, which would replace the panoply of government-inspired programmes. Councils selected for such compacts would get extra government cash and support. With the network influential in parts of the government, the reaction of ministers so far has been interesting.

Back in 1893 they lost seven games in a row but this defeat, their eighth on the bounce, plumbed new depths. </p> <p>Wednesday are barely recognisable these days. Des Walker still has pace, Steve Harkness is competent, but the rest are a mix of over-anxious youngsters and to be brutal, journeymen. Manager Paul Jewell is making strenuous efforts to sign former Wimbledon striker Efan Ekoku on loan from Grasshoppers of Zurich, but you get the distinct impression only intervention from Heaven rather Efan will end their freefall. </p> <p>Wednesday managed not one notable effort on goal throughout the entire first half.

      "bodyText": "At least the Titanic had a band playing as it sank. Sheffield Wednesday's famously loyal group of musicians were all that was missing as the once mighty Owls sunk to a new low at Turf Moor. Back in 1893 they lost seven games in a row but this defeat, their eighth on the bounce, plumbed new depths. Wednesday are barely recognisable these days. Des Walker still has pace, Steve Harkness is competent, but the rest are a mix of over-anxious youngsters and to be brutal, journeymen. Manager Paul Jewell is making strenuous efforts to sign former Wimbledon striker Efan Ekoku on loan from Grasshoppers of Zurich, but you get the distinct impression only intervention from Heaven rather Efan will end their freefall. Wednesday managed not one notable effort on goal throughout the entire first half. Fortunately for the Owls, Burnley, who had slightly surprised themselves by their results this season, were not much better. The captain Steve Davis always looked most likely to score as he finally sparked Burnley into life with a couple of near-misses and it was no surprise when he finally did break the deadlock. If nothing else, Wednesday were at least fighting for the point which has eluded them for so long. Bodies were put on the line, albeit usually the 18-yard line, and with their opponents lacking a truly creative edge, Jewell must have dared to dream.
