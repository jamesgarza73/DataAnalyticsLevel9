But in a way this is a side issue. For Reed believes the reason England were overrun had nothing to do with bodies in the middle. It was about the players' response to going 2-0 up. </p> <p>\"We had a game plan we thought would work to our advantage,\" he said. \"We felt that if we could get amongst them in midfield, break up their play before it developed, they would be vulnerable on the break and particularly vulnerable to crosses. And in some ways it went too well for us in that respect.\" </p> <p>He believes that after going 2-0 up so early the players got carried away and forgot the plan. \"It possibly affected different players in different ways and we lost a little bit of our impetus in terms of getting involved with the Portuguese in midfield and breaking up the play. </p> <p>\"We didn't expect to go into the lead quite convincingly as early as we did. It was a part of the game plan I think we probably expected to invoke later in the game, and I would say that psychologically that may have thrown us.\" </p> <p>He insists that, after Portugal equalised, messages went out from the bench for the players to return to plan A but they couldn't. \"The players were receptive to the messages but one must remember there are 11 players out there who [must] respond to what you're doing. </p> <p>\"The Portuguese are a very talented midfield. Just getting messages on and giving instructions doesn't guarantee that things are going to change. You've got to give credit to Portugal in the way they handled what we tried to do. </p> <p>\"Football is about cat and mouse, about how one set of players respond to the others, and then it is down to the players on the day. That's why you have a winner and a loser.\" </p> <p>Reed was confirming what many already knew, that the Portugal midfield was much better than England's. Yesterday in training England worked on how to avoid getting stretched and leaving too much space between attack and defence. </p> <p>Keegan also had a brainstorming session with the players in which he seemed to win the argument, steering malcontents away from the notion that a packed midfield would solve all problems. </p> <p>\"He was trying to put across that maybe sometimes some of the players have got to take it on themselves and sort things out,\" said Dennis Wise. \"That's where we went wrong, really. </p> <p>\"The gaffer wanted a few people's opinions, he wanted to have a chat about things and so we all sat down and put our thoughts across because he wanted to hear them. He took note. He's that type of person. He wanted to hear how we went a little bit wrong, what we could have done, what we felt we could have done. </p> <p>\"Maybe it was up to us on the pitch to try and sort it out because it's very hard for him, when the game is going on, to try and sort things out.\" </p> <p>English players thinking for themselves may be a novel concept but to progress in this tournament they need to learn the art, and fast. </p> <p>Tactically the focus now shifts to Germany, who offer a totally different challenge. \"They will want to play at a much lower tempo,\" said Reed. \"They build up from the back whereas the Portuguese move it out from the back as quickly as possible to use the midfield. </p> <p>\"The Germans will drop deeper in the hope they'll pull you out in order to get in behind you.

They have warmed up, and in some cases peaked, during the Germany-Romania match. The German tourists, outnumbered and mostly in family groups, have wisely opted to watch the match in quieter bars at the bucket-and-spade end of town, but that does not stifle the cheers that greet John Motson's assessment of the Germans as \"a shambles\".

One minute Motson is saying, \"This is just a shadow of German sides of the past,\" and \"This is extraordinary and most un-Germanlike,\" and the next Trevor is saying, \"You just can't,\" - go on, Trevor, go for it - \"write the Germans off.\" </p> <p>Ollie was born a decade too late for Mexico 1970 when it first became inadvisable to write the Germans off and is therefore innocent enough to assume a 2-0 lead for England is a winning one, and downs several large, lethal cocktails a bit too ferociously. </p> <p>I have never seen anyone cash his chips in quite so quickly.

Spain was warmer and more fun than Eindhoven or Charleroi, and since they were more interested in sex than violence, it was the place to be. </p> <p>The official guide to the Balearics has a rather sweet way of putting it: \"The English penchant for self-criticism has caused this fine resort to acquire an undeserved notoriety as a beery, working-class playground in the mould of Blackpool or Skegness. It's true that Magaluf has a very lively nightlife, with discotheques such as BCM and English-style pubs open till the early hours of the morning, and that a number of the less mature British visitors -unaccustomed to such a free and easy atmosphere - occasionally become excessively boisterous, but tourists are also attracted to this resort by its clean streets and pine-covered mountain environs.\" </p> <p>The pine-covered environs seem strangely irrelevant as England's lead disappears and despair deepens.

      "body": "<p>It was five years ago when it dawned on Sergen Yalcin that he might just be on to something, that he possibly had it within himself to be something more than just another player with the traditional Turkish sporting traits of fierce partisanship and almost spiritual passion. </p> <p>It all happened when a journalist told the young playmaker he was, in the gossip-driven world of the Turkish media, being openly compared to Paul Gascoigne. </p> <p>At that point in Gascoigne's pantomime of a career the Geordie was public buffoon No1, the big man with the childish demeanour, the genius with a burning desire to swap his gift from the gods for a frothy bottle of the brown stuff and the back-slaps of his fawning acolytes. </p> <p>Sergen did not know it at the time but the comparison was apt for, just as English football simply must serve up its perennial enfant terrible, it is incumbent upon the Turkish game to lay a chosen son upon the slab to be sacrificed at the high altar of disparaging public opinion. The culture may be different but there is the same voracious public appetite for scandal. </p> <p>Like Gascoigne, Sergen is unable to offer anything more than a cursory defence when he is accused of allowing ego to eclipse reason during his formative years as a professional footballer. But, unlike Gascoigne, he was smart enough to appreciate that notoriety is a fickle dance-partner. In short, while the England midfielder continued to sing from the same dog-eared song-sheet, Sergen decided to move on. </p> <p>For a while Sergen's world revolved exclusively and unapologetically around Sergen - which possibly explains his response when first informed of the comparison to Gascoigne. \"Really?,\" he inquired. \"So he is the Sergen of British football, is he?\" It does seem likely that the pair would get on famously. </p> <p>To his detractors - and there are many - Sergen is a luxury item in a team which can ill afford luxuries. The 27-year-old is the personification of indolent arrogance, arguably the most gifted Turkish footballer of his generation and yet one who, for several years, unashamedly placed his personal ambition above the greater needs of the many. </p> <p>\"Being criticised no longer bothers me; I'm used to it,\" he said. \"I get criticised for being lazy, for not doing enough work for the team, for not scoring enough goals from my position just behind the strikers. I'm not bothered any more. I have proved that I can play, that I can dictate the play. </p> <p>\"I do believe it is time that people take a long, hard look at me and accept me for what it is I have to offer,\" he added. \"I don't destroy, I create. I am a good player.\" </p> <p>Notwithstanding his resemblance to a startled rat peering out from behind a lavatory brush, Sergen's fame was such that he pursued the agenda of a playboy with absolute relish, adding an over-fondness for gambling to his list of misdemeanours simply because it was the done thing. That is what they call real style down in the old quarter of Istanbul. </p> <p>And yet, cunningly concealed somewhere between the misunderstood maestro and the rather sad, attention-seeking child is a footballer of immeasurable worth, a player with a classic left foot who could chip a ball into an ashtray from 60 yards. </p> <p>Those who have a fondness for decrying Sergen's abilities have suggested that, when playing at the highest level, he glitters rather than shines. It is a theory to which few who made their way to Arnhem's impressively modern Gelredome on Sunday afternoon would lend their support. </p> <p>The bizarre interpretation of the shoulder-charge ruling by the Scottish referee Hugh Dallas may have presented Italy with the penalty that pushed Turkey to defeat in their opening Group B fixture but Sergen's contribution was immense, an intoxicating cocktail of neatly threaded through-balls and passes so visionary they might have been delivered by Mystic Meg. </p> <p>Sergen's current club is Galatasaray but, rather like Gascoigne, he has the demeanour of a nomad and, having all but exhausted his options in his own backyard (he has also had spells with Istanbulspor and Fenerbahce), he is rumoured to be looking to transport his skills and attendant baggage to foreign shores. The Newcastle United manager Bobby Robson is a long-time admirer. </p> <p>Meanwhile, having finally accepted that, as the linchpin of his national side, he has a responsibility not only to himself but to others, millions of others, Sergen has dedicated himself to banishing the bitter memory of the embarrassment Turkey suffered during the last European Championship finals in England, when they fell at the first hurdle, pointless and goalless. </p> <p>\"We were so naive in England,\" he said. \"We didn't have experience of the big tournaments and that worked against us. Turkish football is improving all the time, season upon season, and we are here to let everyone know that we are worthy and we are motivated.\" </p> <p>They are words Gascoigne would have been proud of, had he ever been sober and sensible enough to say them. </p> <p><strong> Venue</strong> Philips Stadium, Eindhoven </p> <p><strong> Kick-off</strong> 7.45pm </p> <p><strong> Referee</strong> D Jol </p> <p>(Netherlands) </p> <p><strong> Head-to-head</strong> Sweden 1 win, Turkey 2 wins, draws 1 </p> <p><strong> Television</strong> </p> <p>Live on ITV from 7.30pm - repeated at 2.35am - and Eurosport from 7pm. </p> <p>Highlights on BBC1 and Eurosport at 12 midnight. </p> <p><strong> Radio</strong> </p> <p>Live on Radio 5 Live from 7pm </p> <p><strong> Sweden </strong></p> <p><strong>Injuries</strong> R Nilsson (concussion) </p> <p><strong> Suspensions</strong> P Andersson</p>",

I have proved that I can play, that I can dictate the play. \"I do believe it is time that people take a long, hard look at me and accept me for what it is I have to offer,\" he added. \"I don't destroy, I create. I am a good player.\" Notwithstanding his resemblance to a startled rat peering out from behind a lavatory brush, Sergen's fame was such that he pursued the agenda of a playboy with absolute relish, adding an over-fondness for gambling to his list of misdemeanours simply because it was the done thing. That is what they call real style down in the old quarter of Istanbul. And yet, cunningly concealed somewhere between the misunderstood maestro and the rather sad, attention-seeking child is a footballer of immeasurable worth, a player with a classic left foot who could chip a ball into an ashtray from 60 yards. Those who have a fondness for decrying Sergen's abilities have suggested that, when playing at the highest level, he glitters rather than shines. It is a theory to which few who made their way to Arnhem's impressively modern Gelredome on Sunday afternoon would lend their support. The bizarre interpretation of the shoulder-charge ruling by the Scottish referee Hugh Dallas may have presented Italy with the penalty that pushed Turkey to defeat in their opening Group B fixture but Sergen's contribution was immense, an intoxicating cocktail of neatly threaded through-balls and passes so visionary they might have been delivered by Mystic Meg. Sergen's current club is Galatasaray but, rather like Gascoigne, he has the demeanour of a nomad and, having all but exhausted his options in his own backyard (he has also had spells with Istanbulspor and Fenerbahce), he is rumoured to be looking to transport his skills and attendant baggage to foreign shores. The Newcastle United manager Bobby Robson is a long-time admirer. Meanwhile, having finally accepted that, as the linchpin of his national side, he has a responsibility not only to himself but to others, millions of others, Sergen has dedicated himself to banishing the bitter memory of the embarrassment Turkey suffered during the last European Championship finals in England, when they fell at the first hurdle, pointless and goalless. \"We were so naive in England,\" he said. \"We didn't have experience of the big tournaments and that worked against us. Turkish football is improving all the time, season upon season, and we are here to let everyone know that we are worthy and we are motivated.\" They are words Gascoigne would have been proud of, had he ever been sober and sensible enough to say them.

But now Luton wanted to introduce a more realistic rate, in line with changes in the market. EasyJet pays a fee of around \u00a31.60 for each departing passenger. The airport says it has to pay the local council \u00a33 for each EasyJet traveller and wants to increase the fee to around \u00a37. Mr Roberts rejected EasyJet's claim that Barclays Bank, a 65% shareholder in the Luton airport company, was threatening rises in the airline's low cost tickets. Mr Roberts said that Barclays was only an investor and had exerted no influence at Luton on landing charges. Mr Roberts said that he was \"very pleased\" with the CAA's decision. \"We want to main tain our relationship with EasyJet as a value for money airport. All we are asking Mr Haji-Ioannou is that he is sits down with us and resolves our differences.\" He said that the new landing charges would apply from October, adding that the airport \"would not be brow- beaten by EasyJet. We are fighting with the Marquess of Queensberry's rules and are seeking a fair return for our help.\" He added that Luton was expected to make a small profit when its annual report is published later this month. Mr Haji-Ioannou has 14 days to appeal against the decision. He has not threatened to leave the airport, but says that he will not expand the company's services from Luton unless the issue can be settled to his satisfaction.",

Each member of Lucy Pearl brings something dif ferent to the table: Muhammed, credibility; Robinson, sass; and Saadiq, musicianship. With that kind of pedigree, Lucy Pearl seem an exciting project - the perfect pop band. Yet, like most supergroups, they promise more than they actually deliver. </p> <p>Their debut album is lightweight R&amp;B pop, urban soul music before it got seduced by the shiny baubles and bright lights of materialism. The group concern themselves with love and having fun: honorable sentiments perhaps, but they lack the yearning and burning that might make the music truly work.

      "bodyText": "One imagines that Raphael Saadiq, an ex-member of the under-appreciated R&amp;B group Tony Toni Tone, pinches himself every night in disbelief. Not only has he managed to recruit Ali Shaheed Muhammed, the DJ from hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest, to his new project, but Dawn Robinson, formerly of En Vogue, is also on board. Each member of Lucy Pearl brings something dif ferent to the table: Muhammed, credibility; Robinson, sass; and Saadiq, musicianship. With that kind of pedigree, Lucy Pearl seem an exciting project - the perfect pop band. Yet, like most supergroups, they promise more than they actually deliver. Their debut album is lightweight R&amp;B pop, urban soul music before it got seduced by the shiny baubles and bright lights of materialism. The group concern themselves with love and having fun: honorable sentiments perhaps, but they lack the yearning and burning that might make the music truly work. The songs are all very nice but don't reach the soulful heights of Lauryn Hill, nor do they have the goofy esprit of Missy Elliott. Most of them are too respectful and smooth, living up to the coffee table vibe of the project. There's a \"throw things at the wall and see what sticks\" approach to this showcase.

But it says a lot for Mark Rylance's performance and Giles Block's production that they overcome the countless obstacles built into playgoing at the Globe. </p> <p>Rylance is one of nature's Hamlets: alert, humorous and capable of combining whimsical dottiness with a troubled inner life. He handles the soliloquies superbly, as if the words were coming new-minted into his brain. In the first solo he seizes on his mother's \"dexterity\" in hastening to incestuous sheets, as if morally revolted by maternal fickleness. And \"O, what a rogue and peasant slave\" shows Rylance's mastery of the space as he traverses the stage playing off the audience while also suggesting Hamlet's self-flagellation. </p> <p>This is, above all, a witty Hamlet who grows into a stoical acceptance of death. Rylance treats the Ghost's subterranean rumbles as an underground joke, mercilessly joshes Polonius and dons a shit-stained nightgown to denote his antic disposition. But in the last act, as he obsessively clutches a skull, you feel this is a Hamlet who has matured into a keen awareness of mortality. Despite an occasional excess of vocal virtuosity, Rylance offers us a quick-brained Hamlet intrigued by moral and material putrescence. </p> <p>He's backed up by a speedy Jacobean production in which each scene melts into the next. Block has also devised some choice bits of business: Claudius's ostentatious preference for Laertes over Hamlet at court, and Ophelia's eavesdropping on Hamlet's exile, which precipitates her into madness. Some of the surrounding characters seem under-explored but Tim Woodward is a suitably bluff Claudius, James Hayes lends Polonius a touch of sinister blarney and Mark Lockyer's Laertes has a speech of fire that really does blaze. </p> <p>It's a traditional production with an original central performance. But, as so often at the Globe, I found the play came most alive when I quit my assigned seat to roam around the yard: if you can't beat the distracting multitude, canoodling and flicking through their tourist guides, the only thing to do is to join them. </p> <p>In rep at the Globe until September 24.

      "body": "<p>Michael Owen was not at all pleased when Kevin Keegan told him he would not be going out for the second half of England's match against Portugal on Monday night. </p> <p>\"He was absolutely gutted when I took him off,\" Keegan said yesterday, \"as he was when I left him out against Malta. But I said to him: 'You will have your day. You will play a lot of games for England and you will do all the things you want to do that cause peo ple trouble.' But on that day, in the way we played, with what we were trying to do, he wasn't effective enough.\"</p> <p>It is not an easy job being an international coach; not easy to tell a 20-year-old that his day will come; not easy when that 20-year-old is one of England's tiny handful of world-class players. It is not easy to tell him that, although he scored the goal that provided England with a respectable result against Brazil three weeks ago, with the sort of moment of improvisatory brilliance that would have had us swooning had it been performed by a player in a yellow shirt, the coach did not trust him enough to give him a full chance to do it again. It is not easy when you remember what he did to Argentina's defence two summers ago in St-Etienne.</p> <p>Perhaps the worst part of it was that, during his 45 minutes on the pitch at the Philips Stadium on Monday, Owen had actually delivered England's best pass of the night. In the 18th minute he went out to the right wing to get the ball and played a disguised ball inside to David Beckham at such an angle and with such swiftness that the entire flank of the Portuguese defence was thrown off balance, allowing Beckham to cross the ball for Steve McManaman to score the goal which put the team two up.</p> <p>There were lots of good things about England's performance in the first half but nothing better than that. Beckham, Paul Scholes and McManaman all did well but none of them produced a pass as instinctive and effective. Owen is a special player and there was the evidence, if we still needed it.</p> <p>But, in Keegan's view, he has an important deficiency. \"We just weren't holding the ball up well enough,\" he said when explaining his decision to send on Emile Heskey in place of his Liverpool team-mate.</p> <p>Over the next 45 minutes we all saw how well Heskey held the ball up, which was not at all -and just about as much as Alan Shearer had held it up in the first half and was to do again after the interval. And Shearer achieved nothing remotely like the pass that Owen had given Beckham.</p> <p>Holding the ball up is an old-fashioned virtue that has nothing to do with the way a top international team must play today if it wants to win major tournaments. You hold the ball up for one of two reasons: to run the clock down towards the end of a match or to give your team-mates time to catch up with the play. In today's game, however, if they need time to catch up, then either the wrong tactics are wrong or the platers are wrong.</p> <p>Keegan is right that Owen failed to hold the ball up in the first half. When he received the ball with back to goal and a defender on his neck, he was always trying to twist away and always ended up losing possession. But at some time in the second half he might have tried it again - for the fifth, sixth or seventh time - and made it work. And that is all it would have taken to get a result, as it was against Brazil.</p> <p>Portugal, too, had a striker who could not hold the ball up. His name was Nuno Gomes, he is 23 years old, he had never scored an international goal before this week despite having won eight caps, he was ap pearing against England only because of injuries to others and he was not given the benefit of support from a Shearer-type partner. He was up there all alone. And when he received the ball with his back to goal in the first half, as he did on several occasions, he tried to twist past his marker and invariably forfeited possession.</p> <p>But Humberto Coelho, Portugal's coach, did not see this as a reason to take him off. \"England were very strong on the counter-attack,\" he said afterwards, \"but we kept playing to our style. We didn't think of our opponents. We just did our own job.\"</p> <p>Gomes, having been picked for his own qualities, was part of Portugal's style and was there to do his own job. And Coelho was rewarded for his faith in the second half when Gomes finally received a ball he liked from Rui Costa, a diagonal pass that allowed him to slide between Tony Adams and Gary Neville and clip the ball past David Seaman for the winning goal. Twice more he was to try it and twice more he almost scored.</p> <p>\"I'm never disappointed with young players,\" Keegan said yesterday, in response to an invitation to discuss his decision. \"You have to realise how young Michael is and that, although he's got quite a lot of experience for one so young, he hasn't got the experience of most other players around that field. I just felt that he wasn't getting in the game. When you're young, sometimes it's hard to know what you have to do to get into the game. I just felt we needed another alternative up there. That's what I told him, and that's the truth.\"</p> <p>Unlike some of his predecessors, Keegan is a straight sort of fellow. There is unlikely to have been a hidden agenda behind his decision to show such a public lack of belief in one of his players. It is hard to imagine, for instance, that Shearer's preference for the company of Heskey on the pitch would have influenced him.</p> <p>But the coach made a mistake and he had better not repeat it on Saturday night, when speed and imagination will be needed against Germany's creaking rearguard as England face their last realistic chance to remain in the tournament.</p>",

It will not happen, of course; as captain, Shearer will undoubtedly go down with his already listing ship.</p> <p>Nevertheless injuries have forced two changes on Keegan for the match against the Germans. Tony Adams has a calf problem which will keep him out of both this game and the encounter with Romania in Charleroi on Tuesday. Thus his only chance of taking further part in Euro 2000 will be if England reach the quarter- finals. Steve McManaman also misses Saturday's match with a damaged knee.</p> <p>Presumably Martin Keown will replace Adams with Gareth Southgate recalled should the England coach decide to switch to a back three. Dennis Wise, who came on for McManaman against Portugal, appears set to stay in the team with Steven Gerrard the most likely addition if Keegan opts for playing five across the middle to lessen the risk of re peating the catastrophic defending which cost England their opening game.</p> <p>While a win and a draw might be enough to see England into the quarter-finals, dropping points against Germany or Romania could equally see them eliminated. Unless the organisation and discipline in their own half of the field show a radical improvement it is hard to envisage two English victories as a realistic prospect, not least because an outstanding opportunity of victory has so lamely been thrown away.</p> <p>When North Korea lost 5-3 to Portugal in the 1966 World Cup quarter-finals after taking an early 3-0 lead there were mitigating circumstances. For one thing, the Koreans had not learned how to close a game down in a winning situation. For another, the Portuguese had Eusebio.</p> <p>So what is England's excuse after finding themselves 2-0 up by the 18th minute? Why, after such a marvellous start, has Keegan's team reached a point of elimination from the European Championship with the tournament barely begun?</p> <p>Lack of experience is not a factor. Nine of the side fielded by Keegan had started against Argentina in St-Etienne in the 1998 World Cup and eight had successfully denied the Argentines a winning goal following Beckham's dismissal. England's subsequent exit on penalties at least provided Glenn Hoddle with a hard-luck story.</p> <p>Even Alf Ramsey could offer some sort of plea of mitigation after England, then the World Cup holders, had gone out of the 1970 tournament 3-2 to West Germany in Leon having, like Keegan's side, taken a 2-0 lead. The overnight loss of Gordon Banks to a stomach upset and the mistake by Peter Bonetti which allowed Franz Beckenbauer's saveable shot to bring the Germans back into the contest were circumstances no manager could have foreseen.</p> <p>In becoming the first England coach since Ramsey to lose a match like this, Keegan can reasonably argue that much of what happened was beyond his control. Yet he it was who decided to trust in Paul Ince being able to shield the centre-backs much as he had done in the 1-1 draw with Brazil at Wembley a fortnight earlier, eschewing the opportunity to pack the midfield.</p> <p>Players, not systems, win or lose games but, as Rui Costa, Pinto and Figo increasingly strolled around England's half like men picking apples, the amount Adams has owed at Arsenal to the defensive qualities of Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit became glaringly obvious. With Scholes continuing to join the attack Ince was left on a deck aflame with Portuguese passing and movement, and by the time Wise joined the firefighters, after McManaman's injury, England were all but gutted.</p> <p>\"As a team we didn't defend well,\" Keegan admitted yesterday, \"and that applies to the front players as much as those behind them. Portugal caused us a lot of problems and we didn't come up with all the right answers.</p> <p>\"After we had taken a two-goal lead I think our players got a bit carried away. The atmosphere was euphoric. We needed then to stop Portugal playing for 10 minutes or so. But situations like that are very hard to control. And what would people have said if I'd reacted to going 2-0 up by bringing on Martin Keown? Even at half-time, when it was 2-2, I still thought we could win.\"</p> <p>This is not an England team with outstanding ability in several positions. While the goals by Scholes and McManaman reconfirmed Beckham as one of the most accomplished crossers in the modern game, he did little after half-time because England were unable to win enough possession to get the ball to him.</p> <p>England invariably set out for these tournaments amid strident declarations that they have an outstanding squad capable of taking on anyone. Harmless though such routine chest-beating may be, it becomes embarrassing when the team's limitations are exposed as swiftly and ruthlessly as they were in Eindhoven.</p>",

For one thing, the Koreans had not learned how to close a game down in a winning situation. For another, the Portuguese had Eusebio. So what is England's excuse after finding themselves 2-0 up by the 18th minute? Why, after such a marvellous start, has Keegan's team reached a point of elimination from the European Championship with the tournament barely begun? Lack of experience is not a factor. Nine of the side fielded by Keegan had started against Argentina in St-Etienne in the 1998 World Cup and eight had successfully denied the Argentines a winning goal following Beckham's dismissal. England's subsequent exit on penalties at least provided Glenn Hoddle with a hard-luck story. Even Alf Ramsey could offer some sort of plea of mitigation after England, then the World Cup holders, had gone out of the 1970 tournament 3-2 to West Germany in Leon having, like Keegan's side, taken a 2-0 lead. The overnight loss of Gordon Banks to a stomach upset and the mistake by Peter Bonetti which allowed Franz Beckenbauer's saveable shot to bring the Germans back into the contest were circumstances no manager could have foreseen. In becoming the first England coach since Ramsey to lose a match like this, Keegan can reasonably argue that much of what happened was beyond his control. Yet he it was who decided to trust in Paul Ince being able to shield the centre-backs much as he had done in the 1-1 draw with Brazil at Wembley a fortnight earlier, eschewing the opportunity to pack the midfield. Players, not systems, win or lose games but, as Rui Costa, Pinto and Figo increasingly strolled around England's half like men picking apples, the amount Adams has owed at Arsenal to the defensive qualities of Patrick Vieira and Emmanuel Petit became glaringly obvious. With Scholes continuing to join the attack Ince was left on a deck aflame with Portuguese passing and movement, and by the time Wise joined the firefighters, after McManaman's injury, England were all but gutted. \"As a team we didn't defend well,\" Keegan admitted yesterday, \"and that applies to the front players as much as those behind them. Portugal caused us a lot of problems and we didn't come up with all the right answers. \"After we had taken a two-goal lead I think our players got a bit carried away. The atmosphere was euphoric. We needed then to stop Portugal playing for 10 minutes or so. But situations like that are very hard to control. And what would people have said if I'd reacted to going 2-0 up by bringing on Martin Keown? Even at half-time, when it was 2-2, I still thought we could win.\" This is not an England team with outstanding ability in several positions. While the goals by Scholes and McManaman reconfirmed Beckham as one of the most accomplished crossers in the modern game, he did little after half-time because England were unable to win enough possession to get the ball to him. England invariably set out for these tournaments amid strident declarations that they have an outstanding squad capable of taking on anyone. Harmless though such routine chest-beating may be, it becomes embarrassing when the team's limitations are exposed as swiftly and ruthlessly as they were in Eindhoven.",

      "bodyText": "The BBC has lost the right to screen highlights of Premiership matches on Match of the Day. The BBC bid \u00a340m for the three-year package from the 2001/2 season onwards while ITV bid \u00a361m, the BBC reported. At the same time, BSkyB has held on to the rights to broadcast 66 live matches when the existing deal runs out at the end of next season. And US-based cable giant ntl has won the rights to screen 40 live games on a pay-per-view basis, according to reports. The winners in the auction of the three packages were announced by Premiership chiefs this evening after they spent the afternoon analysing the sealed bids. The decision brings to an end the biggest televised soccer shake-up in nearly a decade, and the first of the new millennium. Three separate Premiership packages were up for grabs, one focusing on highlights and two offering live rights. Only \"free-to-air\" terrestrial broadcasters were allowed to bid for the highlights package. One of the packages was the first ever Premiership pay-per-view deal. All sealed bids had to be submitted by last night and league bosses opened them this lunchtime, before making their decisions on a \"highest bidder wins\" basis. The current shape of TV football coverage was largely forged in 1992, when Sky won the right to broadcast Premier League matches live for five years. A further auction in 1996 saw it retain these, while the BBC kept hold of its right to show edited highlights. Both of these existing arrangements come to an end at the close of the 2000/2001 football season. While ITV had stopped short of saying it was hoping to launch its own version of Match of the Day, station bosses made no secret of their interest in acquiring the rights to the highlights. The victory will offer them the chance to reunite Des Lynam, who switched from the BBC last year, with a Match of the Day-style format.

      "bodyText": "The government will today announce the biggest privatisation yet of a failing education authority, when Leeds becomes the latest Labour council to lose control of its school services following a damning inspection report. The school standards minister, Estelle Morris, will this afternoon reveal that a joint venture company will take over the \u00a3300m service, with local councillors specifically excluded from a five-strong management board. The move dashes the Yorkshire authority's hopes that a review by accountants PricewaterhouseCooper might have allowed councillors to retain some control. The need for intervention in Leeds was signalled by ministers in February, following publication of a highly critical report by the Office for Standards in Education, which the chief inspector of schools, Chris Woodhead, admitted was \"serious and shocking\". School services in Tony Blair's former home borough of Islington were contracted out to the private sector earlier this year in the most significant move to date, but the scale of problems are bigger in Leeds as it is one of the biggest education authorities in England. In Leeds, continual political interference by Labour councillors was singled out by both the Ofsted report and Mr Woodhead. Ofsted identified weak leadership in Leeds in the past as the main reason for the \"parlous state\" of the authority. Leeds council was unable to recruit an education director for four years, it claimed, partly because of perceptions of political interference. In addition, a catalogue of weaknesses, particularly at secondary school level, included failure to monitor the progress of schools or to support those causing concern. The new deal will see a management firm selected by Ms Morris from the Department for Education and Employment's approved list, which will join council staff in a radical reform of the service. The company will appoint two board members who will join two senior Leeds education officers and a chairperson appointed by the education secretary, David Blunkett, from a list of possible candidates submitted by Leeds. The transfer is expected to be completed next spring and could mean redundancies, although existing Leeds education staff will initially be re-employed. The city's education director, Keith Burton, who was appointed less than two years and who won praise from Ofsted for \"making a start\" on reforms, is likely to have a board place. Last night Leeds was not prepared to comment in advance of the announcement, but the Liberal Democrat opposition accused the council of \"throwing away the legacy of 100 years' service to education.\" Graham Kirkland, deputy opposition leader, said: \"For the past 100 years, local councils have been responsible for the education service and they had built an enviable reputation.\" Andrew Carter, leader of the Leeds Conservative group, said that the move was a humiliation but also \"a leap in the dark - a huge government experiment with the children of our city.\" Ms Morris is expected to make the announcement this afternoon after briefing headteachers and local authority chiefs about the plans. In Leeds, the issue has been a particularly sensitive one with teaching unions, who claim they are victims of a political consipiracy. The government has now recommended intervention in a total of 15 local education authorities, and has recently extended its list of approved consultants and provicers in anticipation of the need for further action. Ofsted started statutory inspections of all local authorities in England two-and-a-half years ago as part of Labour's drive to raise school standards, and has now inspected around half of them - 75 in total.",

They warmed up pre-season by attracting the biggest draw in world cricket (and Alan Mullally), then rejoiced when the arrival of Shane Warne coincided with an upturn in the usually stagnant world of county memberships (up 900 to 5000 on last year). But now that the cricket's been under way for a couple of months, Hampshire are really coming into their headline-grabbing own. And for all the wrong reasons. </p> <p> There's plenty of time left, of course, but Hampshire are currently bottom of both their leagues (division one of the Championship and division two of the National League). Before today, when they take on Durham, they'd lost 11 out of 16 games in all competitions this season, and had won just two (with three draws), one of which was a ten-over slog in a rain-ruined B&amp;H group game. Hampshire Hawks? Hampshire Hamsters might be more appropriate.</p> <p> The problem has not been so much with the bowling: Warne (22 first-class wickets at 22.57 in a seam-dominated season) is beginning to feel at home, and even in the temporary absence of Mullally (now bowling well again after injury) and Peter Hartley (still out with a calf injury), players like Dimitri Mascarenhas and Simon Francis have chipped in with four-fors.</p> <p> It's the batting that has fallen woefully short of last year's standards. Going into today's match, Hampshire were yet to top 263 in all cricket, and had only passed 166 once in the one-day game. Worse, they'd been dismissed for less than 150 ten times in 22 innings, and had mustered just three batting bonus points in six Championship games.</p> <p> The top order is a shambles. Last season Jason Laney, Derek Kenway and Will Kendall all averaged over 40 in the Championship. This season they scored three half-centuries between them in their first 61 innings. And of Laney's 21 knocks, 19 ended before he reached double figures. Even more gruesomely (look away now), John Stephenson, who won a Test cap in 1989, failed to pass 33 in 17 innings, while opener Giles White got to fifty twice out of 22 return trips to the pavilion. No-one, not even Robin Smith (four fifties), made a hundred in any competition. Barry Richards must be turning in his commentary seat.</p> <p> So what's gone wrong? After all, Hampshire have simply added Mullally and Warne (who replaced Nixon McLean as the overseas player) to a squad that finished seventh in last year's Championship. Yet that may be part of the problem: they could be the first side ever to finish seventh one year and suffer under the burden of expectation the next. When Warne turned up, messiah-like, people really seemed to believe he could work miracles. It could just be that his team-mates have been treading water all season, expecting Warne to walk on it for them. Now they're all struggling to stay afloat.</p> <p> Then again, maybe Hampshire just played out of their skins last summer and have now found their true level. They have three players (Smith, Warne and Mullally) who would get into any county side, but not much else. Like West Indies, who have survived in recent years thanks to a handy threesome of their own (Brian Lara, Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose), the Hawks are discovering that they need more to feed off.</p> <p> Whatever the reason, Hampshire are fast becoming the whipping boys of the county circuit. They have finished bottom just once (1980) since the full 17-team Championship began in 1921. Now they might find themselves finishing last twice in one year. Hampshire could be in the news again come the end of September.</p> <p><em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com.

Before today, when they take on Durham, they'd lost 11 out of 16 games in all competitions this season, and had won just two (with three draws), one of which was a ten-over slog in a rain-ruined B&amp;H group game. Hampshire Hawks? Hampshire Hamsters might be more appropriate. The problem has not been so much with the bowling: Warne (22 first-class wickets at 22.57 in a seam-dominated season) is beginning to feel at home, and even in the temporary absence of Mullally (now bowling well again after injury) and Peter Hartley (still out with a calf injury), players like Dimitri Mascarenhas and Simon Francis have chipped in with four-fors. It's the batting that has fallen woefully short of last year's standards. Going into today's match, Hampshire were yet to top 263 in all cricket, and had only passed 166 once in the one-day game. Worse, they'd been dismissed for less than 150 ten times in 22 innings, and had mustered just three batting bonus points in six Championship games. The top order is a shambles. Last season Jason Laney, Derek Kenway and Will Kendall all averaged over 40 in the Championship. This season they scored three half-centuries between them in their first 61 innings. And of Laney's 21 knocks, 19 ended before he reached double figures. Even more gruesomely (look away now), John Stephenson, who won a Test cap in 1989, failed to pass 33 in 17 innings, while opener Giles White got to fifty twice out of 22 return trips to the pavilion. No-one, not even Robin Smith (four fifties), made a hundred in any competition. Barry Richards must be turning in his commentary seat. So what's gone wrong? After all, Hampshire have simply added Mullally and Warne (who replaced Nixon McLean as the overseas player) to a squad that finished seventh in last year's Championship. Yet that may be part of the problem: they could be the first side ever to finish seventh one year and suffer under the burden of expectation the next. When Warne turned up, messiah-like, people really seemed to believe he could work miracles. It could just be that his team-mates have been treading water all season, expecting Warne to walk on it for them. Now they're all struggling to stay afloat. Then again, maybe Hampshire just played out of their skins last summer and have now found their true level. They have three players (Smith, Warne and Mullally) who would get into any county side, but not much else. Like West Indies, who have survived in recent years thanks to a handy threesome of their own (Brian Lara, Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose), the Hawks are discovering that they need more to feed off. Whatever the reason, Hampshire are fast becoming the whipping boys of the county circuit. They have finished bottom just once (1980) since the full 17-team Championship began in 1921. Now they might find themselves finishing last twice in one year. Hampshire could be in the news again come the end of September. Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com.

      "body": "<p><strong>IT'S GOOD TO TALK/SHOUT/SLAP</strong></p> <p>Kelvin Koogan had a day off today and left \"director of technical development\" Les Reed to answer all the press's questions for him. This is a fine example of delegation - one of the modern executive's foremost skills (as the Fiver was explaining to its mum the last time it wanted its smalls washed). Delegation at a press conference is one thing however, delegating your team selection quite another.</p> <p>\"Ke[l]vin thinks the players have a contribution to make,\" said Reed this afternoon in response to suggestions that Koogan and his players rowed over tactics after Monday's defeat. \"He thinks it's better to speak to each other rather than keep it to themselves.\" So does Dennis Wise who, tipped to take a place in England's starting line-up on Saturday, offered his opinion on the post-Portugal \"brainstorming session\". \"The gaffer wanted a few people's opinions, he wanted to have a chat about things,\" Wise explained. \"He took notice, he's that sort of person.\"</p> <p>So what were the lessons to be learned from this constructive session? Er, dunno really. \"Maybe it was up to us on the pitch to try and sort it out,\" said Wise, \"It's very hard for [Kelvin], when the game is going on, to try and sort things out.\" However, fellow senior player Paul Ince - do they get any seniorer? - did not share this view. \"We were badly outnumbered in midfield\", said the supposed midfield anchor. \"We were being overrun. Portugal seemed to have extra players wherever you looked.\" Don't panic!</p> <p>Ince also told this morning's Mirror that Monday's scenario will not be repeated. Which hopefully means he's about to drop himself, but more likely means that Incey is confident of a change of tactics. But whatever you take from today's interviews, there does not appear to be a consensus within the England camp on how the team should play. And, if all types of opinions are being voiced and, in some cases it seems, being listened to (as Martin Keown put it, \"In the main, the manager makes the decisions\") is it any wonder that England look lost on the field?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>MATTHAUS IN CENTRE OF BIG ROW SHOCK</strong></p> <p>You've got to feel sorry for Germany coach Erich Ribbeck. His team are useless, he's not very popular and he's pretty sure to be turfed out on his ear come the end of the tournament. So the last thing he needs as he attempts to salvage his battered reputation is for the whole German squad to start bickering like a pair of tanked-up Gallaghers. But that's exactly what they're doing.</p> <p>At the centre of the row is - surprise! - Lothar Matthaus, whose inept defensive display against Romania was the last straw for team-mates already unhappy at his inclusion in the team. Asked whether the rest of the players wanted Matthaus to be dropped, Oliver Bierhoff replied: \"I am loathe to say it here and now. I don't want to say anything here.\" And having given us one line, the big striker kindly gave us another so we had something to read between: \"We will speak to the coach in private and I hope he listens.\"</p> <p>Sadly for Ollie and the equally-cross Oliver Kahn, Mehmet Scholl and Jens Nowotny, Ribbeck intends to give his beleaguered sweeper his 149th cap against England. \"Lothar is a favourite of mine,\" the German coach explained, not exactly diffusing the situation. \"He admitted he was tired after the Romania game but we showed weaknesses that can't be explained just by age and lack of condition.\" So Germany are going to field an unpopular, knackered old man alongside ten piqued and angry individuals... it's going to be really annoying when they win, isn't it?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Instead of joining his mates in camp in Lagos, Kanu has been parading himself in Abuja, promoting his heart foundation programme.

However, the agreement aimed at easing half a century of tension on the Korean Peninsula made no mention of two big concerns: the North's long-standing demand that the United States withdraw its 37,000 troops from South Korea and Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes. Reunificiation itself is an enormous task that some observers say could take decades, even if the accord is carried out by both countries. After the late-night signing in Pyongyang, the North's capital, President Kim Dae-Jung of South Korea and the North's leader, Kim Jong Il, smiled broadly, shook each other's hand vigorously and toasted each other with glasses of champagne. Kim Dae-Jung praised his counterpart for helping him reach a \"historic agreement\" and said the two of them must \"proceed together on a path of reconciliation and cooperation.\" The surprising warmth and good humour of the first two days of the summit transformed the realities of half a century of cold war tensions and marked the end of an era marked by acute tension .

      "bodyText": "The conflict in Northern Ireland has left many mysteries in its wake. The reopened probe into the 1989 murder of nationalist solicitor Pat Finucane and the new inquiry into Bloody Sunday in 1972 are the successful minority of a host of demanded new investigations. The remaining issues which have yet to be satisfactorily resolved attract conspiracy theories, which grow in proportion to the silence of the state. Today saw the government rejecting claims of malfeasance on its part. The Secretary of State Peter Mandelson denounced as a hoax a letter displayed yesterday by the DUP's Ian Paisley Jnr which purported to come from Mandelson's office, advising First Minister David Trimble to keep quiet about the murder last month of Edmund McCoy. The IRA is accused of involvement in the killing, and the \"hoax\" letter suggests playing down its involvement for the good of the peace process. Mandelson accused Paisley Jnr of bringing \"politics and, I am afraid, your party to a new low\". Another candidate for the conspiracy industry is the Chinook helicopter crash into the Mull of Kintyre in June 1994. The Ministry of Defence inquiry into the crash, which killed 25 top security personnel and four RAF crew, blamed the pilots for \"breaching safe flying rules\". This line was reiterated this morning by the armed forces minister John Spellar, after the most senior Scottish law officer questioned the MoD verdict. Lord Advocate Colin Boyd QC said in a letter to an MSP that evidence about the reliability of the Chinook's computerised control system, FADEC, \"reinforced\" concerns about the crash. Lord Boyd did not, however, propose reopening the inquiry. The calls for a new inquiry have mainly come from the families of the two blamed pilots, who had unblemished records before the crash. They believe that \"the government would rather protect the elite within the MoD than to protect natural justice\". The allegation is that the MoD spent a fortune on a bad system, were warned against it in advance by colleagues in the USAF, but went ahead with the deal anyway. Any alleged cover-up is to save face, rather than anything darker. But dark rumours abound. The loss of ten senior RUC intelligence officers, nine army intelligence officers and six MI5 officers on the eve of the 1994 IRA cessation was, for some, propitious. \"The loss of such senior intelligence personalities probably ensured the political case for a peace process to go ahead despite the recent successes against PIRA [Provisional IRA] and loyalist paramilitaries,\" wrote academic Sydney Elliott in the most recent edition of the Northern Ireland Political Directory. The diaries on one of the RUC officers killed in the crash, Ian Phoenix, were published in 1996, and showed the mindset of a dedicated anti-terrorist operator who believed that the IRA could be militarily defeated, if the authorities let them \"do their job\". Some of those killed were certainly involved in contentious episodes, such as the \"Shoot to Kill\" operations on the early 80s, in which six alleged republicans were shot dead in circumstances which themselves have been the subject of call for a new inquiry. Some loyalists believe that the intelligence officers were deliberately \"taken out\" for \"knowing too much\" about the people the government would have to deal with in a post-conflict Ulster. Men such as Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, the current Education Minister who once was at the top of the list as IRA supremo, as far as Ian Phoenix was concerned. The truth, alas, is probably less prosaic and more mundane.",

      "byline": "Dave Hill",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Big question: is this a grim age of fatherhood, or a golden one? Are dads with dependent children better at being parents than their own dads were, or are they getting worse? You could be forgiven for believing either is the case - or both. On the bright side, displays of paternal devotion have become ubiquitous, from the endless images in the 80s of New Men and their newborns, to their crescendo in recent weeks with David Beckham parading his little boy alongside his winner's medal. Oh yes: and the prime minister spent a fortnight at the cotside of young Leo. </p> <p>But if such scenes seem to signify a fatherhood renaissance, another version of what's happening is less cheering. The \"deadbeat dad\" who leaves his family in the financial lurch has outstripped the teenage single mother as the folk devil of family life. And he is but one manifestation of a more generalised disquiet over men's failures in departments in which their own dads were rarely required to succeed: \"being there\" emotionally and dealing with the parts of parenting that are a grind rather than a romp. </p> <p>What, then, is the true story of fatherhood today? In lots of ways it is one of uncertainties - those of fathers themselves and those of mothers and children about what fathers are and ought to be. The unsatisfactory but developing body of sociological data on fathers today bears this out. Charlie Lewis, professor of psychology at Lancaster University, has produced a digest of 21 recent survey findings relevant to fathers, for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. In his introduction, he notes the \"continuing confusion over the part men actually play in today's families, and a lack of consensus about their potential role in child-rearing\". </p> <p>The explanation for this is to some extent straightforward: it is simply that fathers vary. Indeed, over the past 30 years of rapid family change, they have become so varied that broad generalisations are treacherous. </p> <p>This is vital to keep in mind given the current preoccupation with paternal desertion. While substantial numbers of fathers do lose touch with their children after a relationship ends, most maintain contact - and a vast majority live in the same household as their children. And when we look a little deeper at how modern fathers go about being parents, it becomes plain that we are living through a social revolution with the potential to be glorious. </p> <p>It is a staple of \"sex war\" journalism that nappy-changing, dinner-cooking New Dad is a myth. It is true that, in most two-parent families, men do continue to be the ones who earn most, if not all, the money, while mothers take on the bigger share of childcare and other domestic responsibilities - but in households in which both parents do paid work, these things are commonly reported to be equally shared. There is also a substantial minority of households in which fathers are the main carers, with mothers going out to earn. </p> <p>What's more, men have become more available to their children when they're not at work, being more closely involved and spending more time with them. Revealingly, the most pronounced shift in parenting from mothers to fathers is taking place not among the trendy, liberal middle classes but among families in which the men are unemployed or working part-time. The affluent may talk the talk, but it's the working man who is more likely to walk the walk. </p> <p>Such trends buttress optimists' belief that a New Dad figure is slowly emerging, one who may replace the \"traditional\" template for fatherhood of male breadwinner and distant disciplinarian with something more rounded, more emotionally available and generally more involved . But while evidence of such a change is mounting, it is plain that the transition is far from complete or painless. When men today are asked how they feel about being dads, they routinely tell researchers they'd like to \"be there\" for their children physically and spiritually in ways their own fathers often failed to do. Yet many still don't do it and many who are actively involved with their children say they are unhappy with their situations. </p> <p>Culture, not biology, holds the key to this discrepancy. Lewis notes that \"men who work long hours and share childcare with their partners are more likely than others to report feeling stressed and dissatisfied with their lives\". In other words, \"having it all\" can be a problem for fathers too. </p> <p>There is also the little matter of a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. \"Despite the increasingly 'hands-on' reality of fathering for many men,\" Lewis writes, \"cultural stereotypes of fathers as 'providers' and 'breadwinners' continue to exert a strong influence over men, women and children's attitudes to parenthood.\" Perhaps this in part explains why, even though parents in dual-income families often say childcare is shared, it is rare for the fathers to describe themselves as the main carer or for the mothers to describe themselves as providers. Men are aware that more is expected of them as parents these days, yet they still see their principal duty as bringing home the bacon and still often regard themselves as less well-equipped for childcare than women are. What's more, mothers and children often agree. </p> <p>Conservatives insist this proves the need for family roles to be re-configured along \"traditional\" lines. Yet when fathers raise children without mothers, whether due to bereavement or family breakdown, they frequently learn that, breastfeeding aside, there is no kind of nurturing they can't do, and once bound to their children in the ways mothers are, they don't want to be \"free\" of them again. This suggests that what fathers and families need most urgently is not a return to the past but to be given the kind of cultural permission and practical support for the beautiful, bruising task of parenting that mothers have bestowed on them by virtue of their sex. Can this be achieved? Will men - and women - organise to achieve it? </p> <p>There is a long way to go. So much public debate about fathers has focused on custody and maintenance, with fathers represented by \"fathers rights\" militants bewailing judges and \"feminazis\". While the workings of the system certainly gives cause for concern, the wider effect has been to render the whole territory of fatherhood reform toxic to activists of wider vision and goodwill. Adrienne Burgess, author of Fatherhood Reclaimed (Vermilion), points out: \"The good dads/bad dads dichotomy . . . results, in part, from the invisibility of fathering. The only time we find out what they do is when we find out what they don't do, such as pay child support, or when they abuse someone.\" </p> <p>Happily, this imbalance is beginning to be corrected.

      "bodyText": "Big question: is this a grim age of fatherhood, or a golden one? Are dads with dependent children better at being parents than their own dads were, or are they getting worse? You could be forgiven for believing either is the case - or both. On the bright side, displays of paternal devotion have become ubiquitous, from the endless images in the 80s of New Men and their newborns, to their crescendo in recent weeks with David Beckham parading his little boy alongside his winner's medal. Oh yes: and the prime minister spent a fortnight at the cotside of young Leo. But if such scenes seem to signify a fatherhood renaissance, another version of what's happening is less cheering. The \"deadbeat dad\" who leaves his family in the financial lurch has outstripped the teenage single mother as the folk devil of family life. And he is but one manifestation of a more generalised disquiet over men's failures in departments in which their own dads were rarely required to succeed: \"being there\" emotionally and dealing with the parts of parenting that are a grind rather than a romp. What, then, is the true story of fatherhood today? In lots of ways it is one of uncertainties - those of fathers themselves and those of mothers and children about what fathers are and ought to be. The unsatisfactory but developing body of sociological data on fathers today bears this out. Charlie Lewis, professor of psychology at Lancaster University, has produced a digest of 21 recent survey findings relevant to fathers, for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. In his introduction, he notes the \"continuing confusion over the part men actually play in today's families, and a lack of consensus about their potential role in child-rearing\". The explanation for this is to some extent straightforward: it is simply that fathers vary. Indeed, over the past 30 years of rapid family change, they have become so varied that broad generalisations are treacherous. This is vital to keep in mind given the current preoccupation with paternal desertion. While substantial numbers of fathers do lose touch with their children after a relationship ends, most maintain contact - and a vast majority live in the same household as their children. And when we look a little deeper at how modern fathers go about being parents, it becomes plain that we are living through a social revolution with the potential to be glorious. It is a staple of \"sex war\" journalism that nappy-changing, dinner-cooking New Dad is a myth. It is true that, in most two-parent families, men do continue to be the ones who earn most, if not all, the money, while mothers take on the bigger share of childcare and other domestic responsibilities - but in households in which both parents do paid work, these things are commonly reported to be equally shared. There is also a substantial minority of households in which fathers are the main carers, with mothers going out to earn. What's more, men have become more available to their children when they're not at work, being more closely involved and spending more time with them. Revealingly, the most pronounced shift in parenting from mothers to fathers is taking place not among the trendy, liberal middle classes but among families in which the men are unemployed or working part-time. The affluent may talk the talk, but it's the working man who is more likely to walk the walk. Such trends buttress optimists' belief that a New Dad figure is slowly emerging, one who may replace the \"traditional\" template for fatherhood of male breadwinner and distant disciplinarian with something more rounded, more emotionally available and generally more involved . But while evidence of such a change is mounting, it is plain that the transition is far from complete or painless. When men today are asked how they feel about being dads, they routinely tell researchers they'd like to \"be there\" for their children physically and spiritually in ways their own fathers often failed to do. Yet many still don't do it and many who are actively involved with their children say they are unhappy with their situations. Culture, not biology, holds the key to this discrepancy. Lewis notes that \"men who work long hours and share childcare with their partners are more likely than others to report feeling stressed and dissatisfied with their lives\". In other words, \"having it all\" can be a problem for fathers too. There is also the little matter of a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. \"Despite the increasingly 'hands-on' reality of fathering for many men,\" Lewis writes, \"cultural stereotypes of fathers as 'providers' and 'breadwinners' continue to exert a strong influence over men, women and children's attitudes to parenthood.\" Perhaps this in part explains why, even though parents in dual-income families often say childcare is shared, it is rare for the fathers to describe themselves as the main carer or for the mothers to describe themselves as providers. Men are aware that more is expected of them as parents these days, yet they still see their principal duty as bringing home the bacon and still often regard themselves as less well-equipped for childcare than women are. What's more, mothers and children often agree. Conservatives insist this proves the need for family roles to be re-configured along \"traditional\" lines. Yet when fathers raise children without mothers, whether due to bereavement or family breakdown, they frequently learn that, breastfeeding aside, there is no kind of nurturing they can't do, and once bound to their children in the ways mothers are, they don't want to be \"free\" of them again. This suggests that what fathers and families need most urgently is not a return to the past but to be given the kind of cultural permission and practical support for the beautiful, bruising task of parenting that mothers have bestowed on them by virtue of their sex. Can this be achieved? Will men - and women - organise to achieve it? There is a long way to go. So much public debate about fathers has focused on custody and maintenance, with fathers represented by \"fathers rights\" militants bewailing judges and \"feminazis\". While the workings of the system certainly gives cause for concern, the wider effect has been to render the whole territory of fatherhood reform toxic to activists of wider vision and goodwill. Adrienne Burgess, author of Fatherhood Reclaimed (Vermilion), points out: \"The good dads/bad dads dichotomy . . . results, in part, from the invisibility of fathering. The only time we find out what they do is when we find out what they don't do, such as pay child support, or when they abuse someone.\" Happily, this imbalance is beginning to be corrected. Fathers Direct, the information and lobbying organisation for dads, now has the ear of the government, which has backed small but important schemes to foster active fathering among men. Of course, there's a bit more to be done before Britain catches up with Sweden, which has its own minister for the family and regards male parents as equally important as female ones. Still, let's look on the bright side. Maybe Leo will wake our PM up in more ways than one. The facts \u0095 Seven out of 10 families consist of children living with both parents. \u0095 70% of non-resident fathers have some contact with their children; almost 50% see their kids every week. \u0095 66% of women working full-time and 48% of women working part-time say childcare is equally shared. \u0095 58% of fathers with few or no academic qualifications say they take equal share of childcare, compared with 35% of those with degrees. \u0095 More than 25% of fathers work more than 50 hours a week.

He remembers school holidays when he'd go with his dad to the factory where his father, always dressed in a suit, made those plastic windmills children love. </p> <p>But what dominates his childhood memories is lying in bed and hearing the front door shutting as his father went off to work at the crack of dawn; then late at night, listening out for the sound of his dad's car pulling up, the front door opening, the front door closing - until the same time the next morning, when his dad left for work once more. </p> <p>\"Looking back, I think he was a good dad in his own way,\" says Paul, now 38. \"He did two jobs, so he was at work from 6am to 10pm, making sure he kept us kids in shoes.\" </p> <p>Jim Brown, now aged 70, was the archetypal father-provider. \"He did what he thought parenting was,\" says Paul. \"I'm not sure what I felt at the time, but now I can see how I've benefited. He taught me the importance of responsibility.\" But Paul wants to be more than just a provider of material comforts to his children - twins Yolyn and Jordan, 13, and Louis, 10. The fact that he hasn't lived with them since his relationship with their mother broke down six years ago is no obstacle as far as he's concerned. </p> <p>\"I just remember dad working, grafting to earn money. In terms of talking about what was happening in my life, he wasn't really there. I see my role as being part of my children's everyday lives. I am provider, protector, adviser. Someone who will open up opportunities for them, someone who emotionally supports them.\" </p> <p>Paul, who lives in Leicester, sees his children every other weekend and telephones them regularly. \"When I was living with them, I'd see them every night and every morning. I was part of their lives. I met their friends. Now in order to be part of that, it's a lot of hard work.\" </p> <p>He tries to talk to them intimately (it's easier with his daughter than his two sons, he says); he hugs and kisses them (Jordan's not keen); holds their hands and makes a point of telling them he loves them. Yet he still finds it difficult to talk intimately to his own father. \"Dad and I only have conversations about practical things - jobs, cars, sport, mortgages. The only time I've really talked with him was when me and my partner split up. He said I should stay with her. He struggled with the fact that you can be a good father and not be in the home. Whereas he was in the house when I was a child but I didn't spend time with him, I'm not in the house with mine, but I spend time with them.\" </p> <p>Paul was at the birth of all of his children. He changed their nappies and fed them. After work, he would look after the children while their mother did a part-time job. </p> <p>Jim, on the other hand, didn't see any of his four children born. He was nearly there for Paul, who was born at home, but he was sent out to call the doctor and by the time he returned, Paul had been delivered. \"In those days most men never saw their children born,\" says Jim. \"I didn't do a lot of nappy-changing and all that. I used to find time to take them to the park. </p> <p>Because my wife never worked, she was the one who dealt with their growing up. I was busy working hard, trying to be a good father, making sure that they kept out of trouble, that they had enough to eat, that they had clothes to wear and good manners. Because of that, most likely the little things that I should have seen, I didn't see.\" </p> <p>Jim didn't talk about love with his son. \"In your family, you show love to them by what you do. You don't have tell your son, 'I love you.'\" He thinks Paul, however, is a brilliant father. \"I was devastated when he split up from the children's mother. But if there's one thing I'm really proud of, it's how he looks after the children. He is a devoted father.\" </p> <p>The two men recently went to France for the day. Paul planned the trip because he wanted to tell his father that he loved him and that he thought he had been a good dad. But, somehow, the conversation kept veering off on a tangent. </p> <p>\"It's one of those conversations I want to have before he dies,\" says Paul. We've had ups and downs, but the only reason I am where I am today is because he gave me direction and support and I knew he would always be there for me.\" </p> <p>From one father to another, it doesn't get much better than that.</p>",

But what dominates his childhood memories is lying in bed and hearing the front door shutting as his father went off to work at the crack of dawn; then late at night, listening out for the sound of his dad's car pulling up, the front door opening, the front door closing - until the same time the next morning, when his dad left for work once more. \"Looking back, I think he was a good dad in his own way,\" says Paul, now 38. \"He did two jobs, so he was at work from 6am to 10pm, making sure he kept us kids in shoes.\" Jim Brown, now aged 70, was the archetypal father-provider. \"He did what he thought parenting was,\" says Paul. \"I'm not sure what I felt at the time, but now I can see how I've benefited. He taught me the importance of responsibility.\" But Paul wants to be more than just a provider of material comforts to his children - twins Yolyn and Jordan, 13, and Louis, 10. The fact that he hasn't lived with them since his relationship with their mother broke down six years ago is no obstacle as far as he's concerned. \"I just remember dad working, grafting to earn money. In terms of talking about what was happening in my life, he wasn't really there. I see my role as being part of my children's everyday lives. I am provider, protector, adviser. Someone who will open up opportunities for them, someone who emotionally supports them.\" Paul, who lives in Leicester, sees his children every other weekend and telephones them regularly. \"When I was living with them, I'd see them every night and every morning. I was part of their lives. I met their friends. Now in order to be part of that, it's a lot of hard work.\" He tries to talk to them intimately (it's easier with his daughter than his two sons, he says); he hugs and kisses them (Jordan's not keen); holds their hands and makes a point of telling them he loves them. Yet he still finds it difficult to talk intimately to his own father. \"Dad and I only have conversations about practical things - jobs, cars, sport, mortgages. The only time I've really talked with him was when me and my partner split up. He said I should stay with her. He struggled with the fact that you can be a good father and not be in the home. Whereas he was in the house when I was a child but I didn't spend time with him, I'm not in the house with mine, but I spend time with them.\" Paul was at the birth of all of his children. He changed their nappies and fed them. After work, he would look after the children while their mother did a part-time job. Jim, on the other hand, didn't see any of his four children born. He was nearly there for Paul, who was born at home, but he was sent out to call the doctor and by the time he returned, Paul had been delivered. \"In those days most men never saw their children born,\" says Jim. \"I didn't do a lot of nappy-changing and all that. I used to find time to take them to the park. Because my wife never worked, she was the one who dealt with their growing up. I was busy working hard, trying to be a good father, making sure that they kept out of trouble, that they had enough to eat, that they had clothes to wear and good manners. Because of that, most likely the little things that I should have seen, I didn't see.\" Jim didn't talk about love with his son. \"In your family, you show love to them by what you do. You don't have tell your son, 'I love you.'\" He thinks Paul, however, is a brilliant father. \"I was devastated when he split up from the children's mother. But if there's one thing I'm really proud of, it's how he looks after the children. He is a devoted father.\" The two men recently went to France for the day. Paul planned the trip because he wanted to tell his father that he loved him and that he thought he had been a good dad. But, somehow, the conversation kept veering off on a tangent. \"It's one of those conversations I want to have before he dies,\" says Paul. We've had ups and downs, but the only reason I am where I am today is because he gave me direction and support and I knew he would always be there for me.\" From one father to another, it doesn't get much better than that.",

Flight ZD576 was carrying 25 senior security staff from Belfast to Scotland when it slammed into a hill on the Mull of Kintyre. All on board were killed. An air force board of inquiry found that the two pilots, flight lieutenants Jonathan Tapper and Richard Cook, were entirely to blame for the crash. The families of both men have been campaigning ever since to clear their names, and doubts have repeatedly been raised about the safety of the highly complex Chinook machines. Suspicion has focused on the sophisticated computer software fitted to the helicopters, known as Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC). In 1998 the House of Commons select committee on defence concluded that there was \"no compelling evidence\" of technical faults. The latest calls for a new investigation are based on a claim that Scotland's senior law officer, Lord Advocate Colin Boyd QC, has questioned the original inquiry findings. In a letter to Scottish parliament member Kenny MacAskill, the lord advocate revealed that Crown counsel had considered new evidence on possible technical reasons for the crash. However, Boyd also says in the letter that the new information does not invalidate earlier findings of pilot error. He said today that he had written to MacAskill only to clarify the legal situation, not to reopen doubts about the negligence verdict. Spellar was more specific. On the Today programme, he insisted that the pilots were responsible for the crash. \"By flying too fast and too low in fog and in a hilly area they were breaching safe flying rules,\" he said.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Malcolm Ranger remembers vividly how he was told to sell up the family home to fund his mother's nursing home fees. \"She'd been in hospital for months, with a heart condition and congestion on the lungs,\" he says. \"She was incontinent, permanently on oxygen and a catheter, and couldn't feed herself. But they wanted her bed and kept piling on the pressure for me to get her into a care home.\" </p> <p>That felt bad enough. But there was worse to come when a social worker casually let slip - in front of Ranger's mother - that her home in Accrington, Lancashire, worth around \u00a345,000, would have to be put on the market to finance the move. \"I couldn't believe what I was hearing,\" he says. \"I thought I was going mental, breaking down. Not only were they prepared to send this desperately sick old lady out of there, they also wanted her to give up her home and her bit of savings for the privilege.\" </p> <p>Sadly, Leonora Ranger died last December, at the age of 85, just as a \"progress meeting\" was being convened to move her out of hospital. Two other women on her ward died within weeks of being shifted to nursing homes. The whole experience has left her son bitter at the callous way he feels she was treated - and angry at a system that seems to penalise people who have scrimped and saved all their lives. </p> <p>Next to pension levels, the cost of long-term care is one of the most emotive political issues facing the government. And following the drubbing Labour received from pensioners in the local elections, it is one issue it can ill-afford to ignore. Up and down the country there are hundreds and thousands of constituents whose assets bring them to just above \u00a316,000, the cut-off point at which the state pays some of their care costs. Only those with less than \u00a310,000 don't have to use any of their capital. </p> <p>Half of all people over 80 who live alone - the ones most likely to need long-term care - have assets above the \u00a316,000 threshold. Already, some 40,000 homes are sold each year to pay for nursing and residential home fees. And the proportion of this age group who own their homes is set to rise from 46% to 60% over the next 15 years. </p> <p>With its long-awaited response to the royal commission on long-term care due next month, there are strong signals that the government plans to soften the capital and savings limits. This would play well with middle-income older voters and their relatives, and work out a lot cheaper than the commission's recommendation to make all personal care costs free. But new research findings, to be launched tomorrow by the Nuffield Foundation, suggest that such a move may be more trouble than it's worth. </p> <p>The Nuffield report examines the implications for different categories of pensioners of reforming the capital limits and other means tests. It comes up with surprising results. </p> <p>Increasing current capital limits to \u00a320,000 or \u00a330,000 - the kind of figure being bandied about in Whitehall - would apparently have a negligible effect on the assets pensioners could hang on to when they go into care. Only a really dramatic rise to, say, a lower capital limit of \u00a360,000 and an upper one of \u00a3100,000 would significantly bene fit older people, particularly those in middle income groups. </p> <p>On the other hand, a modest increase in the personal expenses allowance - the sum that care home residents are allowed to keep from their income - could reap political dividends. Raising this allowance from its paltry level of \u00a315.45 a week to perhaps \u00a330 would put about \u00a3700 extra a year into poorer pensioners' pockets. Importantly, for a government keen on targeting benefit rises on the most needy, the lion's share of this extra expenditure would go to the least well-off elderly people. </p> <p>Disregarding more income, rather than tinkering with capital limits, could therefore make a lot of sense, says the report's author, Ruth Hancock. This is because of the way income and capital are run down when someone goes into care. Whatever the level of capital you own, all your income (except for that \u00a315.45 pocket money) has to go towards meeting care costs. </p> <p> For the average person with assets above the \u00a316,000 threshold, this means paying \u00a3190 a week from your capital towards typical weekly care home fees of between \u00a3310 and \u00a3370. The rest would be paid for out of your pension, attendance allowance, interest on savings and other income. </p> <p>According to the report, at this rate it takes a pretty long time for most people to run down their capital to the \u00a316,000 threshold: nine years for half of them, and four years for three-quarters of the population. Given that the average length of time an elderly person spends in residential care is three years, that still leaves a fairly substantial portion of assets to pass on to children and grandchildren. Meanwhile, raising personal allowances would give care home residents more cash to enjoy in the here and now. </p> <p>So has the problem of selling homes to fund care costs been over-hyped? Philip Spiers, of the Nursing Home Fees Agency, certainly feels there is too much emphasis on the capital limits issue. \"With such a shortage of funding for adequate services, any additional money that is available should be put into that, rather than increasing people's personal wealth,\" he argues. </p> <p>The NHFA, which gives specialist advice on paying long-term care costs, reckons that any substantial increase in the capital limits threshold would have a disastrous effect on care homes, because local authorities could not afford to subsidise the vastly increased numbers of non-fee paying residents. There are also serious doubts about how increased capital limits could work fairly, given the north-south housing price divide. </p> <p>But the strength of feeling around this issue has never been just about economics. Selling up the family home under duress has a distressing symbolic significance. Not only does it mark the end of independence and normality for the older person in question; it can also feel like an affront to pensioners who have worked, saved and paid taxes to provide for their families' futures. </p> <p>Hancock acknowledges that the psychological impact of the capital and savings rules can be considerable, particularly when - as in the Ranger family's case - the means tests are applied insensitively by professionals. However, she argues that, compared with the wider problems besetting the long-term care system, small increases in the capital limits are barely relevant. </p> <p>The Nuffield study takes a side-on look at some of these problems, such as the perverse financial incentive that encourages local authorities to place older homeowners in residential care, rather than keep them in their own homes. Making all personal care free - or disregarding most of people's housing wealth - would wipe out that incentive at a stroke. Yet ministers are likely to view either option as too costly and of limited benefit to the poorest pensioners. </p> <p>In all this discussion of means-testing minutiae, there is perhaps a danger of losing sight of the bigger picture. People are angry about parting with their property principally because they imagined the state would provide for them in old age. In particular, they resent a system that provides free care in hospital, but demands that you pay for it in a care home. </p> <p>It was this, plus the indecent haste with which the authorities wanted to discharge his mother, that really upset Malcolm Ranger. He says: \"They made you feel like you were being greedy, when in fact everything was being done for their convenience, to avoid paying for her for one day more.\" </p> <p><strong>Between a rock and a hard place</strong></p> <p> In the run-up to its white paper on long-term care, the government has been consulting on ways to reform the funding system. So how might the various options - raising the capital limits, relaxing other means tests, or making all personal care free - impact on a situation like that facing the Dunn family? </p> <p>Andrew Dunn's mother, Beryl, who is 83, suffers dementia. Since the death of her husband in December, she has not been able to cope alone. At present, she is being well cared for, free, in a special hospital unit near her home in Grantham, Lincolnshire. But she will not be allowed to stay there permanently. Her son, who has power of attorney, has had to put her \u00a355,000 semi on the market to help pay for the nursing home she will shortly move to. The fees there will be \u00a3350 a week. Beryl has around \u00a35,000 in savings, gets about \u00a378 a week from her state and private pensions, and receives the higher rate attendance allowance. </p> <p>As things stand, Beryl will have to pay the full cost of her first four years in care. Nor would matters improve much if the government raised the current capital limits by a small amount. If, for example, the upper limit was raised from \u00a316,000 to \u00a320,000, she would be eligible for state support marginally sooner, but would still have to eat slowly into her remaining capital. If the lower capital limit was simultaneously raised from \u00a310,000 to \u00a315,000, she would still have to wait almost four years for state support, but would not have to use up any more capital. </p> <p>A much bigger increase in the upper capital limit, to \u00a360,000, would make her eligible for local authority support almost immediately. But over three years she would still have to contribute around \u00a335,000 from her pension and savings, with some \u00a3100-\u00a3200 a week coming from her capital. If, on the other hand, capital limits were left untouched, but all personal care costs were made free, she would only need to contribute \u00a320,600 from her pension and savings, and would not have to draw on her capital.</p> <p> \u0095 Charging for Care in Later Life: A Summary of the Effects of Reforming the Means Test, by Ruth Hancock, is available (\u00a34.75, incl p&amp;p) from University of Leicester, 22-28 Princess Rd West, Leicester, LE16TP (tel: 0116-252 5422).</p>",

Her son, who has power of attorney, has had to put her \u00a355,000 semi on the market to help pay for the nursing home she will shortly move to. The fees there will be \u00a3350 a week. Beryl has around \u00a35,000 in savings, gets about \u00a378 a week from her state and private pensions, and receives the higher rate attendance allowance. As things stand, Beryl will have to pay the full cost of her first four years in care. Nor would matters improve much if the government raised the current capital limits by a small amount. If, for example, the upper limit was raised from \u00a316,000 to \u00a320,000, she would be eligible for state support marginally sooner, but would still have to eat slowly into her remaining capital. If the lower capital limit was simultaneously raised from \u00a310,000 to \u00a315,000, she would still have to wait almost four years for state support, but would not have to use up any more capital. A much bigger increase in the upper capital limit, to \u00a360,000, would make her eligible for local authority support almost immediately. But over three years she would still have to contribute around \u00a335,000 from her pension and savings, with some \u00a3100-\u00a3200 a week coming from her capital. If, on the other hand, capital limits were left untouched, but all personal care costs were made free, she would only need to contribute \u00a320,600 from her pension and savings, and would not have to draw on her capital. \u0095 Charging for Care in Later Life: A Summary of the Effects of Reforming the Means Test, by Ruth Hancock, is available (\u00a34.75, incl p&amp;p) from University of Leicester, 22-28 Princess Rd West, Leicester, LE16TP (tel: 0116-252 5422).",

Similarly, integrated transport and concessionary travel have a hollow ring if transport is integrated and affordable, but unavailable or inaccessible to provide the opportunities for older people to make their contribution to their families and communities and enjoy as inclusive a quality of life as other age groups. Ageism and age discrimination are, in short, barriers to wider engagement and contribution to local communities, including service provision and participatory democracy. Opinions differ as to whether age discrimination can most effectively be tackled by legislation. But the vast majority of older people engaged in the programme believe that legislation is an essential prerequisite for change. The continuing work of the interministerial group on older people, the appointment of a minister to champion older people's issues within government, and the introduction of supported independent living for older people as a beacon council theme are positive messages that the government is listening. That listening needs to be translated into action, which need not always mean legislation, but it does mean fostering and developing a culture of change, leading by example, and being prepared to hold organisations accountable for failures to remove the financial and structural barriers that will facilitate better government for all our futures. The findings and recommendations of the Better Government for Older People programme are relevant to the whole spectrum of government, political activity and service provision because better government for older people means better government for all. The most effective champions of the changes that are necessary will be older people. Without their continued contribution through generating new ideas, and monitoring progress, change is unlikely to be achieved and less likely to be sustained.",

The United Nations Development Project has been saying it for several years. Its 1999 Human Development Report stated that the income gap between the fifth of the world's people living in the richest countries and the fifth in the poorest was 74 to 1 in 1997, up from 60 to 1 in 1990 and 30 to 1 in 1960. </p> <p>Within countries, inequality had been rising since 1980 it said, citing China, the countries of eastern Europe and the CIS, and OECD countries, \"especially Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States\" as examples. </p> <p>But the free traders, led by the World Bank, are fighting back. Their new weapon, widely hailed in the financial press last week, is a long, detailed economic research paper full of equations and theory, called Growth is Good for the Poor, by David Dollar and Aart Kraay, of the World Bank's development research group. </p> <p>The Financial Times said that the paper \"provides what appears to be incontestable evidence\" that sustained growth raises the real incomes of the poor and that growth is \"helped along by just the policies many of the demonstrators oppose: by macro-economic stability and openness to trade\". </p> <p>Even the Guardian joined in. Mark Atkinson wrote on the economic pages that the report illustrated \"the harm that would be inflicted on the poor if governments were to listen too hard to the protesters at Seattle and retreat from open markets\". </p> <p>It does no such thing. As Dollar and Kraay's purported conclusions seem set to become one of the myths of our time, to be used triumphantly whenever arguments about globalisation break out, it is worth looking at what their report actually says, and what its figures really show, rather than the spin which is being loaded on to them. </p> <p>Labelled \"preliminary and incomplete\", their paper claims that 370 observations from 125 countries over four decades show that: </p> <p>\u0095 When a country grows economically, the incomes of the poor - the bottom 20% of the population on the income scale - tend to rise at the same percentage rate as those of everyone else. </p> <p>\u0095 The incomes of the poor do not drop by proportionately more than those of the better-off in economic crises. This applies to poor countries as well as richer ones. </p> <p>\u0095 The relationship has not changed in recent years as countries have progressively opened themselves up to the free movement of goods, services and capital. </p> <p>\u0095 Openness to international trade benefits the poor to the same extent as everyone else. </p> <p>\u0095 Government spending on primary education and democratic institutions doesn't do anything to raise the share of national income going to the poor. </p> <p>\u0095 Cutting government expenditure and curbing inflation raise the growth rate. They also seem to give the poor a larger share of the higher incomes that result. </p> <p>\u0095 State social spending does not increase the growth rate. Nor does it increase the share of national income going to the poor. </p> <p>The final three remarkable conclusions have been greeted with glee by economic fundamentalists and require an investigation by themselves. In the space available here, the best we can do is to look at the claim hard-wired to the paper's title, that growth is good for the poor because it raises their incomes by as much as those of everyone else. </p> <p>Since the poorest fifth of the population in every country gets only a tiny fraction of total national income - in the US, for example, it gets 4.2% - one explanation for D&amp;K's results could be that their data isn't accurate enough to pick up the real changes taking place. A 1% error, for example, could mean that the poor had lost a quarter of its income, without it showing in the figures. </p> <p>\"There's a lot of approximation,\" says Ray Thomas, who teaches statistics at the Open University. \"Estimating the income of the bottom 20% [they way D&amp;K have done] is defensible because of the lack of any alternative. But it is not really good enough when the aim of the exercise is to make generalisations about the average income level of the bottom 20%.\" </p> <p>Especially, as Dollar and Kraay write, they know very little about what has happened to the distribution of income within the bottom 20%. Thomas thinks that as the bulk of the incomes received by the bottom 20% go to the richer members of it, their figures might well be missing what's happening to the poorest of the poor. </p> <p> So the most likely explanation of the conflict between the UNDP statistics and Dollar and Kraay's is inadequate data. \"For most countries, only one or a handful of observations are available,\" their paper admits. </p> <p>Moreover, even if we accept the paper's finding that the incomes of the poor grew at the same rate as the rich in percentage terms, what this means in real life is that the absolute number of possessions the rich could afford was growing much faster than those of the poor. If the top 80% of the population had 96% of the income and the bottom 20% had 4% initially, 25% growth would have enabled the poor to acquire one more possession for every 20 acquired by the better off. </p> <p>But this is playing the economists at their own game by measuring everything in money terms. This is a mistake because when economic growth takes place, almost everything in society and the economy changes, and even if incomes rise sharply it is impossible to say without a detailed social investigation whether the population of the country concerned becomes better off. </p> <p>For example, because the growth statistics only measure the monetarised parts of the economy, they ignore those things that people do for themselves. Thus, if a child is cared for by its mother at home, that does not contribute to national income and hence growth. If it is placed with a childminder, it does.

Whether this indicates they are better off is another question. </p> <p>Supposing, for example, that when a third world country opened up its economy to the world its agricultural workers were required to become more mechanised. If, as a result, fewer workers were needed in the countryside and they moved to city slums, growth could well be generated by such a change and the incomes of the people who moved could well be higher than they were in their villages. </p> <p>However, as they would then have to buy all their food and fuel rather than producing it for themselves, and might have to pay rent and fares for the first time, they could easily be much worse off. </p> <p>Dollar and Kraay's paper is not pure research.

But today, as part of national carers' week, the group publishes a study on a dimension still little appreciated: the impact of the experience on young carers as they move into adulthood and seek to make their way in the world. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, this impact is largely negative. Those who have been young carers are likely to have patchy school records, to have endured poverty and social isolation and to have found difficulty making space for themselves. But there is very often an upside: by having had to assume responsibility early in life, young carers tend to be mature beyond their years and to have practical and personal skills that ought to make them attractive propositions in the labour market. \"Ought to\", however, is very much the point. </p> <p>As Anna, a 19-year-old carer, says: \"I was inquiring about social work and social services and I know basically you've got to have this, you've got to have that, you've got to have the other. And I was like: 'Oh my god, I haven't got any of those.' \" </p> <p>Official estimates indicate there are up to 50,000 young carers who provide \"substantial care on a regular basis\" to others, usually family members. Many more under-18s are likely to do rather less than that, yet still suffer adverse effects. Today's study, being launched at the House of Commons at an event hosted by Malcolm Wicks, the minister for lifelong learning, suggests that while services for young carers have improved - there are now 115 local support projects, compared to 37 in 1995 and just two in 1992 - services for their families as a whole remain hit and miss. </p> <p>Moreover, there appears little specific help on offer for young adults who have been carers since childhood or adolescence and are living with the consequences. They are too old for young carers' groups, but often do not identify with adult carers' networks. </p> <p>Such is the apparent scale of this problem that the researchers found difficulty contacting over-18s for their study, funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. In all, the research team interviewed 60 current or past carers, 36 of whom were aged 16-18 and 24 aged 19-25. Half came from single-parent families and two-thirds were carers for their mothers. Almost all carried out domestic tasks, such as cleaning, cooking, washing and ironing, and almost half provided personal care such as washing, bathing or toileting. </p> <p>Sixteen-year-old Graham is typical. He lives with his younger sister and mother, who has a muscle-wasting disease and is very weak. He lifts her, empties her commode and helps monitor her blood-sugar level. He does most of the cooking, helps with the housework and collects her benefit. The family has no outside services. </p> <p>Graham has left school and is attending a college course three days a week to learn plastering. But he gets no income at all, explaining that \"my Mum gives me \u00a32 for those three days . . . that's enough\". </p> <p> Graham says he cannot recall his GCSE results, but he knows he had no passes at higher grades. Half the sample of young carers had missed some school, mostly on account of their caring duties, and in some cases they had done so with the collusion of teachers and education welfare staff. A quarter had no GCSEs and only a quarter again had a job. </p> <p>While some of the sample felt they had been forced to grow up too soon, many believed their experience placed them well for the world of work - however few their formal qualifications. Many, too, were keen on a job in the caring professions. Yet in what the research report calls a \"catch 22\", they often found themselves barred from entry because of their lack of certificates. </p> <p>\"I originally wanted to do nursing and I talked to my careers thing and she said I had no chance of doing it because I've never passed my exams,\" says Kirsty, 16. \"I was going to do health and social care, but I talked about it to the careers woman at college and she said: 'With your caring for your mum and all that you've done, it would probably just bore you to do the same thing again.' \" </p> <p>The report, Growing Up Caring, by Chris Dearden and Saul Becker, makes clear it is not acceptable for young people to have to learn skills in this no-choice way, in the absence of proper, professional services. </p> <p>But it goes on to argue that given that young carers do acquire special abilities and personal qualities, rightly or wrongly, there should be some way of crediting them in the employment market against forgone formal qualifications. </p> <p>As Sandra, 19, says: \"I think I sort of became an adult when I were 15... like a woman might be running a house, I were doing all the things maybe a 22 or 23 year old would be doing. I think I became mature when I were 15.\" </p> <p> <strong>Fighting mother's battle</strong></p> <p> If she had not been a young carer for her mother, Cassie Wragg doubts she would now be working in health care. \"I always wanted to go into the media, actually,\" she says. \"I don't think I would have had the interest if it hadn't been for Mum.\" </p> <p>Mum is Liz Fletcher, who was diagnosed as a manic depressive about five years ago. Even before then, though, Cassie - now 18 - was acting as her carer. The formal services have never met their needs. </p> <p>\"It's mainly social services that are the problem,\" says Cassie. \"They'll offer somebody to come and do the cleaning, or to sit and talk to mum, but that's not what we need. Anyway, I don't think it's appropriate to have somebody unknown to both us. </p> <p>\"What we need is an explicit guarantee that right away when mum gets ill, if she needs help we will get that help and care.\" </p> <p>The mother and daughter, who come from Derby and have always lived alone, are happier with the service provided over the past two years by a community psychiatric nurse. \"That does help: there is somebody to phone up and ask to intervene,\" says Cassie. But she is under no illusions that her caring role will be needed for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>\"I don't feel it is an obligation,\" she insists. \"If mum is ill, I will look after her; if I'm ill, she will look after me. It's like teamwork.\" </p> <p>Cassie is employed as a student healthcare worker by the Southern Derbyshire Mental Health trust. She is currently working nights at a unit for elderly mentally ill people, and she hopes to train as a mental health nurse. </p> <p> Liz admits to being concerned at the multiple pressures her daughter faces. \"I am worried about the emotional implications for her because it's such hard work, caring for people,\" she says. </p> <p>\"I run the local manic depression support group and I had a call last night, when I wasn't feeling too bright myself, from somebody slashing herself because she was raped five years ago and has never spoken to anybody about it. Cassie is facing people in distress every day of her working life.\" </p> <p>On the other hand, Liz has no doubts about her daughter's caring skills. \"She's absolutely amazing,\" she says. \"She has an instinctive ability to know what I need, when I need it, and she is my best advocate. She fights for me when I can't fight for myself.\" </p> <p>Cassie did not take part in the latest Loughborough study, but she and her mother are among advisers to the young carers' research group. </p> <p>Unlike most of those in the study sample, Cassie says her school education did not suffer because of her domestic commitments. \"For as long as I can remember, Mum has been ill,\" she says. \"It's always seemed part of our life and we've just got on with it.\" </p> <p>Can she envisage a time when she would move out of the family home, leaving her mother to cope on her own? </p> <p>\"Whatever happens, I would always be 100% for my mum,\" she insists. \"I would keep coming back anyway to do my laundry.\" </p> <p>For now, living with and caring for her mum does not seem to be cramping Cassie's style. </p> <p>\"Boyfriends? She gets through them at a rate of knots,\" says Liz. \"She's a young woman like any other.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Growing Up Caring is available from the National Youth Agency, 17-23 Albion Street, Leicester, LE1 6GD (0116-285-3700) at \u00a312.95 inc. p&amp;p.

In all, the research team interviewed 60 current or past carers, 36 of whom were aged 16-18 and 24 aged 19-25. Half came from single-parent families and two-thirds were carers for their mothers. Almost all carried out domestic tasks, such as cleaning, cooking, washing and ironing, and almost half provided personal care such as washing, bathing or toileting. Sixteen-year-old Graham is typical. He lives with his younger sister and mother, who has a muscle-wasting disease and is very weak. He lifts her, empties her commode and helps monitor her blood-sugar level. He does most of the cooking, helps with the housework and collects her benefit. The family has no outside services. Graham has left school and is attending a college course three days a week to learn plastering. But he gets no income at all, explaining that \"my Mum gives me \u00a32 for those three days . . . that's enough\". Graham says he cannot recall his GCSE results, but he knows he had no passes at higher grades. Half the sample of young carers had missed some school, mostly on account of their caring duties, and in some cases they had done so with the collusion of teachers and education welfare staff. A quarter had no GCSEs and only a quarter again had a job. While some of the sample felt they had been forced to grow up too soon, many believed their experience placed them well for the world of work - however few their formal qualifications. Many, too, were keen on a job in the caring professions. Yet in what the research report calls a \"catch 22\", they often found themselves barred from entry because of their lack of certificates. \"I originally wanted to do nursing and I talked to my careers thing and she said I had no chance of doing it because I've never passed my exams,\" says Kirsty, 16. \"I was going to do health and social care, but I talked about it to the careers woman at college and she said: 'With your caring for your mum and all that you've done, it would probably just bore you to do the same thing again.' \" The report, Growing Up Caring, by Chris Dearden and Saul Becker, makes clear it is not acceptable for young people to have to learn skills in this no-choice way, in the absence of proper, professional services. But it goes on to argue that given that young carers do acquire special abilities and personal qualities, rightly or wrongly, there should be some way of crediting them in the employment market against forgone formal qualifications. As Sandra, 19, says: \"I think I sort of became an adult when I were 15... like a woman might be running a house, I were doing all the things maybe a 22 or 23 year old would be doing. I think I became mature when I were 15.\" Fighting mother's battle If she had not been a young carer for her mother, Cassie Wragg doubts she would now be working in health care. \"I always wanted to go into the media, actually,\" she says. \"I don't think I would have had the interest if it hadn't been for Mum.\" Mum is Liz Fletcher, who was diagnosed as a manic depressive about five years ago. Even before then, though, Cassie - now 18 - was acting as her carer. The formal services have never met their needs. \"It's mainly social services that are the problem,\" says Cassie. \"They'll offer somebody to come and do the cleaning, or to sit and talk to mum, but that's not what we need. Anyway, I don't think it's appropriate to have somebody unknown to both us. \"What we need is an explicit guarantee that right away when mum gets ill, if she needs help we will get that help and care.\" The mother and daughter, who come from Derby and have always lived alone, are happier with the service provided over the past two years by a community psychiatric nurse. \"That does help: there is somebody to phone up and ask to intervene,\" says Cassie. But she is under no illusions that her caring role will be needed for the foreseeable future. \"I don't feel it is an obligation,\" she insists. \"If mum is ill, I will look after her; if I'm ill, she will look after me. It's like teamwork.\" Cassie is employed as a student healthcare worker by the Southern Derbyshire Mental Health trust. She is currently working nights at a unit for elderly mentally ill people, and she hopes to train as a mental health nurse. Liz admits to being concerned at the multiple pressures her daughter faces. \"I am worried about the emotional implications for her because it's such hard work, caring for people,\" she says. \"I run the local manic depression support group and I had a call last night, when I wasn't feeling too bright myself, from somebody slashing herself because she was raped five years ago and has never spoken to anybody about it. Cassie is facing people in distress every day of her working life.\" On the other hand, Liz has no doubts about her daughter's caring skills. \"She's absolutely amazing,\" she says. \"She has an instinctive ability to know what I need, when I need it, and she is my best advocate. She fights for me when I can't fight for myself.\" Cassie did not take part in the latest Loughborough study, but she and her mother are among advisers to the young carers' research group. Unlike most of those in the study sample, Cassie says her school education did not suffer because of her domestic commitments. \"For as long as I can remember, Mum has been ill,\" she says. \"It's always seemed part of our life and we've just got on with it.\" Can she envisage a time when she would move out of the family home, leaving her mother to cope on her own? \"Whatever happens, I would always be 100% for my mum,\" she insists. \"I would keep coming back anyway to do my laundry.\" For now, living with and caring for her mum does not seem to be cramping Cassie's style. \"Boyfriends? She gets through them at a rate of knots,\" says Liz. \"She's a young woman like any other.\" \u0095 Growing Up Caring is available from the National Youth Agency, 17-23 Albion Street, Leicester, LE1 6GD (0116-285-3700) at \u00a312.95 inc. p&amp;p.

He would have a very good case. As a government, the US has consistently stifled free trade. Tiny independent operators like Cuba and Nicaragua have been virtually forced out of business and all sorts of international laws broken in the process.</p> <p>With the kind of breath- taking arrogance that you only get from the leaders of world superpowers and 17-year-old public school boys, America actually attempted to make it illegal for European countries to trade with Cuba; the case against America is even greater than the one against its richest citizen. Like Microsoft the US has a variety of operating systems; in the Balkans they used Nato, but the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank and even the United Nations itself have all been called into play at various times. This will probably be the last European football championship in which a team from Europe is allowed to win.</p> <p>Any fair-minded judge would have to agree that like Microsoft, the US has abused its monopoly of power and must therefore be broken up. It has refused to operate a level playing field and so must be separated into its constituent parts. Dividing it between north and south is one option, but this was tried before apparently, and caused all sorts of problems. You could split it between Democrats and Republicans or Pepsi and Coke drinkers or between the pro- and anti-gun lobby, though this might be a bit unfair if another civil war broke out. But the American courts have ruled that monopolies should not be allowed to dominate and so the US must be as good as its word. If Microsoft Windows is not allowed to give you free bundled software, then each Americanised country should not automatically get a McDonald's in every high street and Jerry Springer repeats on their TV channels.</p> <p>There must be a way of dividing America up so that we continue to get Seinfeld and ER, but are not compelled to get the rest of the American culture that is bundled in with it. Can we have the films without having to watch the speeches at the Oscars? Can we have the music without the graffiti on our subways? The break up of America will be such a complex job that somebody will have to design a computer programme to do it. If only Microsoft hadn't been fragmented. It probably had a free programme on Windows 2000 that could have done it all for us. <br><br><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\" target=\"_new\">comment@theguardian.com</a><br></p>",

Gates should now hit back by counter-suing the US for operating anti-competitive practices. He would have a very good case. As a government, the US has consistently stifled free trade. Tiny independent operators like Cuba and Nicaragua have been virtually forced out of business and all sorts of international laws broken in the process. With the kind of breath- taking arrogance that you only get from the leaders of world superpowers and 17-year-old public school boys, America actually attempted to make it illegal for European countries to trade with Cuba; the case against America is even greater than the one against its richest citizen. Like Microsoft the US has a variety of operating systems; in the Balkans they used Nato, but the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank and even the United Nations itself have all been called into play at various times. This will probably be the last European football championship in which a team from Europe is allowed to win. Any fair-minded judge would have to agree that like Microsoft, the US has abused its monopoly of power and must therefore be broken up. It has refused to operate a level playing field and so must be separated into its constituent parts. Dividing it between north and south is one option, but this was tried before apparently, and caused all sorts of problems. You could split it between Democrats and Republicans or Pepsi and Coke drinkers or between the pro- and anti-gun lobby, though this might be a bit unfair if another civil war broke out. But the American courts have ruled that monopolies should not be allowed to dominate and so the US must be as good as its word. If Microsoft Windows is not allowed to give you free bundled software, then each Americanised country should not automatically get a McDonald's in every high street and Jerry Springer repeats on their TV channels. There must be a way of dividing America up so that we continue to get Seinfeld and ER, but are not compelled to get the rest of the American culture that is bundled in with it. Can we have the films without having to watch the speeches at the Oscars? Can we have the music without the graffiti on our subways? The break up of America will be such a complex job that somebody will have to design a computer programme to do it. If only Microsoft hadn't been fragmented. It probably had a free programme on Windows 2000 that could have done it all for us. comment@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "A survivor of the Hillsborough disaster told a court today how he fought for his life in the packed pens where 96 people were crushed to death. Lifelong Liverpool fan Colin Moneypenny described how he was swept off his feet as he walked down a tunnel at Sheffield Wednesday's ground with hundreds of fans who flooded in before the 1989 FA Cup Semi-Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Mr Moneypenny, who was giving evidence at the manslaughter trial of former senior South Yorkshire police officers David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray, described the scene at the ground as \"complete and utter chaos\". He told the jury at Leeds Crown Court that he went through a gate which was opened on the orders of Duckenfield to release pressure on the turnstiles eight minutes before kick-off. He said that as he walked down the tunnel the gradient, plus the \"sheer numbers\" of people, led to him being \"literally carried off my feet for 30 to 40ft\". Mr Moneypenny was carried to within 10ft of the perimeter fence at the front of Pen Three, where most of the victims died. \"I had no choice about staying in that position for the next 15 minutes,\" he said. \"I was fighting for my life, but I was dimly aware a football match had started.\" Former chief superintendent Duckenfield, 55, who was match commander on the day, and former superintendent Murray, 58, one of his assistants, deny the manslaughter of John Anderson and James Aspinall at Hillsborough stadium on April 15, 1989. They have also denied wilfully neglecting to carry out a public duty. Alun Jones, QC, prosecuting on behalf of the Hillsborough family support group, said the tragedy occurred because Duckenfield ordered the opening of Gate C, allowing thousands of fans to flood down the tunnel into the pens, instead of taking the \"simple and obvious\" step of blocking off the tunnel. Mr Jones stressed that the defendants' \"critical omission\" was not a spur of the moment decision, but took place over a period of 20 minutes. \"The prosecution doesn't have to prove exactly what was in the mind of these defendants,\" he said. \"Was it they were simply indifferent and failed to give any thought to an obvious risk? \"These defendants appear to have regarded the spectators not as a group of individual, vulnerable men women and children, but a security problem.\" He said Hillsborough was an \"old, shabby, badly arranged and confusing\" ground, but added: \"Whatever the other causes, we say the primary and immediate cause of this was the failure to close the tunnel when the order to open the gates was given. \"This, we say, amounts to manslaughter.\" Earlier, members of the victims' families had wept as they watched a video film of the events leading up to the disaster. Film shot from police and club cameras showed the build-up of fans outside the ground and the moment when the gate was opened. Other BBC footage showed the moment when supporters surged on to the crowded terrace. Mr Jones told the jury that neither defendant had done anything to stop the game until 3.06pm when another superintendent had run on to the pitch on his own initiative. He said that by then people in some distress had already been seen climbing out of the pens. Around 20 witnesses who were in the ground would be called to give evidence, he said.",

The 26-year-old currently plays for Racing Club Argentina and would cost around \u00a32m.",

But incredibly the similarities with Becks don't end there. Mutu's \"even got his own Posh - he's been dating TV presenter Alexandra Dimu, a household name in Romania for two months.\" Well I never!

      "body": "<p>In the history of British sci-fi TV, Quatermass might have had more intellectual depth and Doomwatch more topical relevance, but neither of them ever had a hope of matching the longevity and cult appeal of Doctor Who. The sceptical observer might assume that the show's rickety sets, absurd space monsters and rather fey man in a long scarf - all crammed inside a telephone booth, if you will - would be an instant turn-off for anybody born after the end of post-war rationing. But thanks to the fantastic networking capabilities of the internet, new \"Whovians\" keep breeding like an alien plague. </p> <p>Endless reruns on cable and satellite TV are already keeping the Doc alive, but it looks like he's due to be born yet again in a new feature film. Since no long-lost episode, morsel of trivia or piece of merchandising memorabilia is too insignificant to merit further investigation, the rumours of a new full-length Doctor Who movie to be made by the BBC have been minutely dissected by the Who cognoscenti. </p> <p>Long experience has taught top Doc-spotters to treat stories of this kind with extreme caution. However, there seems to be something in the wind, whatever its final shape turns out to be. Stories of a new Who film project appeared in the press during 1999, suggesting it would be directed by Paul Andersen with some nvolvement from distributors Artisan Entertainment. That has apparently bitten the dust, but BBC Films now looks as though it's inching closer to committing itself to its own movie. </p> <p>Whiskery Beeb supremo Greg Dyke is believed to have waved through a budget allocation of 15 million quid.

      "bodyText": "In the history of British sci-fi TV, Quatermass might have had more intellectual depth and Doomwatch more topical relevance, but neither of them ever had a hope of matching the longevity and cult appeal of Doctor Who. The sceptical observer might assume that the show's rickety sets, absurd space monsters and rather fey man in a long scarf - all crammed inside a telephone booth, if you will - would be an instant turn-off for anybody born after the end of post-war rationing. But thanks to the fantastic networking capabilities of the internet, new \"Whovians\" keep breeding like an alien plague. Endless reruns on cable and satellite TV are already keeping the Doc alive, but it looks like he's due to be born yet again in a new feature film. Since no long-lost episode, morsel of trivia or piece of merchandising memorabilia is too insignificant to merit further investigation, the rumours of a new full-length Doctor Who movie to be made by the BBC have been minutely dissected by the Who cognoscenti. Long experience has taught top Doc-spotters to treat stories of this kind with extreme caution. However, there seems to be something in the wind, whatever its final shape turns out to be. Stories of a new Who film project appeared in the press during 1999, suggesting it would be directed by Paul Andersen with some nvolvement from distributors Artisan Entertainment. That has apparently bitten the dust, but BBC Films now looks as though it's inching closer to committing itself to its own movie. Whiskery Beeb supremo Greg Dyke is believed to have waved through a budget allocation of 15 million quid. Casting is rumoured to have been entrusted to Phillip Hinchcliffe, experienced producer of the TV series, while possible directors include John Glen, who has lensed a long list of Bond movies as well as Gerry Anderson's Space Precinct, Sidney J Furie (The Ipcress File and Superman IV), film and TV veteran Michael Apted, and erstwhile pop video director Russell Mulcahy.

A painful public exorcism is what India needs, and quick. Kamran Abbasi, born in Lahore, brought up in Rotherham, is editor of the Bulletin of the World Health Organisation.

      "body": "<p>Public sector finance departments face some dramatic changes over the coming few years. New technology, different structures, greater use of outsourcing and the sharing of key services between different bodies and authorities will all make their mark. All finance staff are likely to have to learn new skills and accept that services will be provided in different ways. And the changes will go all the way to the top. Finance directors in councils, hospitals and other local service bodies will also have to take on new roles. </p> <p>But as the public sector's most senior finance professionals congregate today in Brighton for the annual conference of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa), you are unlikely to find many either surprised by or fearful of the future transformation of their territories. For in a world where the only things you can rely on are insufficient funding and constant upheaval, coping with change has become part of the job. </p> <p>In the NHS the emergence of the private finance initiative as the only serious option for building new hospitals has demanded new skills of finance directors. Now they are thrown into high-level negotiations on multi-million pound deals with consortiums made up of banks, builders and facilities management experts. There are huge legal implications and enormous political pressures to close deals and get new hospitals open. \"These are very complex financial arrangements,\" says Jim Birrell, the director of finance and performance of the NHS executive's north-west regionaloffice. \"They are probably as complex as any arrangements in any walk of financial life.\" </p> <p>But Birrell, who chairs the NHS executive's national finance staff strategy group, says the private finance initiative is just one of a number of areas where finance directors have had to learn new skills. Clinical negligence, with claims rising steeply, is another. \"This is a new area for finance to get involved with,\" he says. \"It just wasn't a big thing a few years ago.\" </p> <p>The image of finance departments has also changed. The days of finance directors being seen as mere \"bean counters\" or the abominable no-men, stamping on innovation wherever they see it, are long gone. Finance is no longer just bolted on to frontline activities, but is an integral part of service delivery. And as this change has come about, finance directors have also broadened their roles into the general management arena. </p> <p>Only 12% of the nearly 500 finance directors in the NHS now have a portfolio of finance alone. The rest boast a wide range of responsibilities including IT, performance management, primary care, fraud, purchasing, supplies, estates, transport, medical records and clinical coding. There are even finance directors with managerial responsibility for some clinical support services such as pathology. </p> <p>But further changes will be required of finance directors. Health authorities are slowly relinquishing commissioning responsibilities to the new GP-led primary care groups, which are themselves starting to convert to primary care trust status, adding the provision of community health services to their commissioning role. For health authority finance directors this has meant developing a more strategic role, focusing more on producing health improvement programmes and performance management. </p> <p>Advancing technology will also cause a major redesign of finance departments. The NHS executive is already examining how routine financial services could be run from a small number of shared service centres, providing initially payroll and accounts payable services to all their local health bodies. Other \"back room\" services such as human resources and estates could follow. </p> <p>Although this approach may reduce the size of existing finance departments, Birrell says it is an opportunity, not a threat. \"It should allow finance directors to move away from involvement with transactions, concentrate on their core role and emphasise their value-added approach,\" he says. And although some finance staff will be displaced, Birrell believes they will stay in the NHS, with their skills making them ideally suited for other important areas such as performance management, controls assurance and evidence-based medicine. A discussion paper will be published by the NHS executive this summer laying out a vision of the future finance function in the NHS. </p> <p>In local government, finance directors with responsibility for just finance are also becoming a rarity. For instance, Sarah Wood, the director of finance and performance review at Birmingham city council, the UK's largest metropolitan council, boasts an impressive array of responsibilities including finance, property, neighbourhood offices and benefits, best value, performance and even press and public relations. And like their colleagues in the NHS, town hall finance directors have also had to learn new skills. They have had to become skilled negotiators, not just because of the private finance initiative, but also because more councils are turning to the private sector to provide services. With outsourcing deals becoming increasingly ambitious, finance directors have had to develop a commercial awareness that in the past was not needed . The continued downward pressure on funding has also forced the council finance director to evolve. \"The treasurer now has to look at different avenues for funding,\" says Brian Smith, the chief executive of Stoke-on-Trent council and current Cipfa president. The single regeneration budget, lottery funds and Europe all have become essential sources of extra cash to support local projects. \"This has demanded new attitudes and new skills,\" he says. </p> <p>But perhaps best value and the government's modernising agenda present the biggest challenges for town hall finance leaders. According to Smith the requirement under best value to challenge rigorously the orthodoxy of how services are run and how money is spent is central to the role of the modern finance director. With town halls also being encouraged to investigate shared services and partnerships, finance departments could look very different in future. Already the landscape is changing. In April, Lincolnshire county council outsourced virtually its whole finance department, together with personnel, property, catering and IT functions. Nearly 800 staff transferred to Hyder Servies, the managed services arm of the utility company Hyder. </p> <p>The decision was taken following a review of the council's finance and resources functions and Mark Spink, the council's then director of finance and resources, accepts that he effectively reviewed himself out of a job. \"The finance job left in the county council was totally different from my role and so there was no job left for me,\" he says. He has since transferred to Hyder. The council has retained a basic strategic financial role around setting the framework for budgets, assessing the impact of government grant changes and some specific functions such as treasury management and internal audit. But most commercial activities are now provided outside the council. And Lincolnshire believes other councils will follow its lead. If they do, the future for town hall treasurers could be very different indeed. </p>",

      "trailText": "<p>Filippo Inzaghi, stung by his Italian critics, is burning to light the Blue touchpaper in Brussels tonight.</p>",
      "byline": "Paddy Agnew  in Brussels",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>At the end of Italy's training session on Monday morning Filippo Inzaghi seemed less than enthusiastic about meeting the media. He had one foot on the team bus when he changed his mind and headed back to the \"mixed zone\" area to say his piece. </p> <p>In essence the striker was expressing his frustration at the extent to which television critics back home had spent more time analysing his near misses in Sunday's 2-1 win over Turkey than his brilliantly struck penalty winner. </p> <p>Just when \"Superpippo\" might have expected to be lauded as a national hero for the way in which he fired home his penalty in spite of a barrage of cans, bottles, cigarette lighters and whistling from the Turkish fans in front of him, he found the critics being less than generous. </p> <p>\"I'm delighted with my goal and I'm holding on to it,\" said Inzaghi. \"As for the rest, that doesn't matter. I live to knock the ball into the back of the net. It's fine by me, even if I score with my hand. Have I made myself clear?\" </p> <p>The 26-year-old Juventus striker, the man who may represent the biggest threat to Belgium's defence when the sides meet in the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels tonight, has experienced a curious fate on the way to these Euro 2000 finals. </p> <p>The army of 56m armchair critics back home worked up a furious - and ongoing - debate as to whether Alessandro del Piero or Francesco Totti should play, and the Rome-based media mounted a campaign in favour of the two Roma strikers Vincenzo Montella and Marco Delvecchio. Many ignored the coach Dino Zoff when he said two weeks ago in Florence that \"certain track records\" do not get overlooked in a hurry. </p> <p>The track record in question was interpreted as being that of Inzaghi, who played in seven out of eight Euro 2000 qualifiers, scoring three goals in the process. He was Italy's joint top goalscorer with the currently injured Christian Vieri. </p> <p>Inzaghi may not please all the critics or the fans but he is one of those players consistently used by coaches. Men as varied in their approach as the Juventus coaches past and present Marcello Lippi and Carlo Ancelotti and the Italy coaches past and present Cesare Maldini and Dino Zoff have all trusted Inzaghi's scoring ability. </p> <p>They have all fastened on to something that has been evident since the early 80s when Inzaghi proved a prolific scorer with his under-11 parish side of San Nicolo, near Piacenza, in northern Italy, namely that if you give the boy the ball in or around the penalty area he will probably go for goal. Often he may miss. Yet often he will score, witness a record that has seen him feature at the top end of the Serie A goal chart for the past five seasons. </p> <p>Inzaghi, though, has always had his detractors. On that memorable autumn night three seasons ago when Manchester United beat Juventus 3-2 in a Champions League first-phase game at Old Trafford, critics in Italy pointed the finger at both Inzaghi and Lippi. How could a Juventus side who had enjoyed the heavyweight presence of such as Gianluca Vialli, Fabrizio Ravanelli and Vieri in attack now trust this lightweight, they asked. </p> <p>Wait until the end of the season for the answer, replied a furious Lippi in Inzaghi's defence. By the end of the season, of course, Inzaghi had played a more than full part in a splendidly successful run which saw Juventus win Serie A as well as lose the Champi ons League final against Real Madrid. </p> <p>Dismissed alternately as a \"poacher\", \"too lightweight\" and \"no good on the big night\", Inzaghi has continued to defy his detractors. When he says he would happily score with his hand, he is not exaggerating. He is the classic self- obsessed, goal-obsessed striker who believes his role on earth is to whack the ball as hard as he can when and if he comes near the opponents' goal. </p> <p>His Juventus team-mate Del Piero rediscovered this aspect of Inzaghi during a 4-0 Serie A win against Venezia in February. The incident in question came in injury-time, when Juventus were already home and dry, leading 2-0. Having rounded Venezia's goalkeeper, Inzaghi found himself wide, almost on the byline. Rather than pass to the waiting Del Piero in the middle he chose to go on a spectacular run across goal, slicing the ball in from a difficult angle. </p> <p>The point about the incident was that at the time Del Piero badly needed to score. On the comeback trail last season after a 10-month lay-off, he went through to the penultimate game - a 1-0 win against Parma - before scoring a league goal from open play; the other eight of his nine goals were from penalties. </p> <p>In the Venezia match, as Inzaghi climbed an advertising hoarding to celebrate his goal, Del Piero stood behind him, arms on his hips, patiently waiting. When Inzaghi finally turned, Del Piero delivered a sharp reprimand. Del Piero afterwards refused to reveal what he had said, admitting only that he had been annoyed and adding: \"I'd just say this, though: it was a good job we were already 2-0 up and a good job, too, that he scored.\" </p> <p>Inzaghi's misses against Turkey have to be seen in that light. The man lives to shoot. His record on Sunday, too, was not that bad, at least according to official Euro 2000 statistics. He had six shots on goal; three were wide, two on target and one a goal. If he maintains that strike rate, Belgium had better beware - and Inzaghi's critics, too.</p>",

      "bodyText": "At the end of Italy's training session on Monday morning Filippo Inzaghi seemed less than enthusiastic about meeting the media. He had one foot on the team bus when he changed his mind and headed back to the \"mixed zone\" area to say his piece. In essence the striker was expressing his frustration at the extent to which television critics back home had spent more time analysing his near misses in Sunday's 2-1 win over Turkey than his brilliantly struck penalty winner. Just when \"Superpippo\" might have expected to be lauded as a national hero for the way in which he fired home his penalty in spite of a barrage of cans, bottles, cigarette lighters and whistling from the Turkish fans in front of him, he found the critics being less than generous. \"I'm delighted with my goal and I'm holding on to it,\" said Inzaghi. \"As for the rest, that doesn't matter. I live to knock the ball into the back of the net. It's fine by me, even if I score with my hand. Have I made myself clear?\" The 26-year-old Juventus striker, the man who may represent the biggest threat to Belgium's defence when the sides meet in the King Baudouin stadium in Brussels tonight, has experienced a curious fate on the way to these Euro 2000 finals. The army of 56m armchair critics back home worked up a furious - and ongoing - debate as to whether Alessandro del Piero or Francesco Totti should play, and the Rome-based media mounted a campaign in favour of the two Roma strikers Vincenzo Montella and Marco Delvecchio. Many ignored the coach Dino Zoff when he said two weeks ago in Florence that \"certain track records\" do not get overlooked in a hurry. The track record in question was interpreted as being that of Inzaghi, who played in seven out of eight Euro 2000 qualifiers, scoring three goals in the process. He was Italy's joint top goalscorer with the currently injured Christian Vieri. Inzaghi may not please all the critics or the fans but he is one of those players consistently used by coaches. Men as varied in their approach as the Juventus coaches past and present Marcello Lippi and Carlo Ancelotti and the Italy coaches past and present Cesare Maldini and Dino Zoff have all trusted Inzaghi's scoring ability. They have all fastened on to something that has been evident since the early 80s when Inzaghi proved a prolific scorer with his under-11 parish side of San Nicolo, near Piacenza, in northern Italy, namely that if you give the boy the ball in or around the penalty area he will probably go for goal. Often he may miss. Yet often he will score, witness a record that has seen him feature at the top end of the Serie A goal chart for the past five seasons. Inzaghi, though, has always had his detractors. On that memorable autumn night three seasons ago when Manchester United beat Juventus 3-2 in a Champions League first-phase game at Old Trafford, critics in Italy pointed the finger at both Inzaghi and Lippi. How could a Juventus side who had enjoyed the heavyweight presence of such as Gianluca Vialli, Fabrizio Ravanelli and Vieri in attack now trust this lightweight, they asked. Wait until the end of the season for the answer, replied a furious Lippi in Inzaghi's defence. By the end of the season, of course, Inzaghi had played a more than full part in a splendidly successful run which saw Juventus win Serie A as well as lose the Champi ons League final against Real Madrid. Dismissed alternately as a \"poacher\", \"too lightweight\" and \"no good on the big night\", Inzaghi has continued to defy his detractors. When he says he would happily score with his hand, he is not exaggerating. He is the classic self- obsessed, goal-obsessed striker who believes his role on earth is to whack the ball as hard as he can when and if he comes near the opponents' goal. His Juventus team-mate Del Piero rediscovered this aspect of Inzaghi during a 4-0 Serie A win against Venezia in February. The incident in question came in injury-time, when Juventus were already home and dry, leading 2-0. Having rounded Venezia's goalkeeper, Inzaghi found himself wide, almost on the byline. Rather than pass to the waiting Del Piero in the middle he chose to go on a spectacular run across goal, slicing the ball in from a difficult angle. The point about the incident was that at the time Del Piero badly needed to score. On the comeback trail last season after a 10-month lay-off, he went through to the penultimate game - a 1-0 win against Parma - before scoring a league goal from open play; the other eight of his nine goals were from penalties. In the Venezia match, as Inzaghi climbed an advertising hoarding to celebrate his goal, Del Piero stood behind him, arms on his hips, patiently waiting. When Inzaghi finally turned, Del Piero delivered a sharp reprimand. Del Piero afterwards refused to reveal what he had said, admitting only that he had been annoyed and adding: \"I'd just say this, though: it was a good job we were already 2-0 up and a good job, too, that he scored.\" Inzaghi's misses against Turkey have to be seen in that light. The man lives to shoot. His record on Sunday, too, was not that bad, at least according to official Euro 2000 statistics. He had six shots on goal; three were wide, two on target and one a goal. If he maintains that strike rate, Belgium had better beware - and Inzaghi's critics, too.",

They're the sort of team we prefer to play and they look beatable. But things will have to tighten up a huge amount to give us a chance. </p> <p>It amazed me how many people thought Portugal would be a stick-on, some sort of walkover. A lot of the talk was about who our front pair should be but my biggest concern was always the defence. In most of our previous five or six games we had looked like shipping goals and got away with it by the skin of our teeth. Scotland, Brazil, Ukraine - even Malta - could have had three. This time the luck ran out. </p> <p>Portugal were a joy to watch; their invention was brilliant. But we backed off too much and gave them too much time. In midfield Paul Ince never got to grips with Rui Costa. And the defence was not alive to danger. The players paid to destroy didn't do their shifts. </p> <p>Joao Pinto's equaliser was a classic case. Portugal came about 80 yards with the ball, played about 16 passes and there was not one challenge. Before the final ball Sol Campbell looked unaware of the space Pinto had got into. Someone like Terry Butcher would have seen that. </p> <p>No doubt many will point to Kevin Keegan's Newcastle days and say \"Told you so\". But he must have expected his defenders to take responsibility and do basic jobs. These guys look good in the Premiership but maybe when they step up that extra notch in class they get caught out. Let's not forget that by the time England were 2-0 up Portugal could have had five. </p> <p>So how best to avoid a repeat? First of all let's play three at the back and Nigel Martyn in goal. David Seaman flapped at a few crosses and got away with things. It was hard to pin the goals on him but Martyn played a blinder against Ukraine and deserves a go. </p> <p>More radically, I'd opt for Gareth Barry at left-wing-back. Germany have no one in the Luis Figo class on the right and Barry brings a freshness of mind. Steven Gerrard, whom I'd play in the midfield anchor role, offers the same and that's important. A lot of the players have seen disappointment at Euro 96 and France 98 and it might be coming back to them. Gerrard and Barry are uninhibited. </p> <p>The absence of Tony Adams is not disastrous. Instead, with Campbell, I'd play Gareth Southgate and Martin Keown, who I think has been the best defender all season. They offer agility and, in Keown's case, real pace. </p> <p>Steve McManaman's injury loses us running in midfield but I think Dennis Wise is good enough to compensate. Some see Nicky Barmby as a natural replacement but Wise has had a fine season and has shown in Europe he has a great ability to nick goals. </p> <p>So with Paul Scholes in a link role and Alan Shearer just about getting the nod up front, my team, lining up 3-5-1-1, would be: Martyn; Keown, Southgate, Campbell; G Neville/P Neville, Beckham, Gerrard, Wise, Barry; Scholes; Shearer. </p> <p>The attacking midfielders were the plus against Portugal. I still think we need more quickness and brightness, but the players should feel they can beat Germany, who looked shaky and lacking in pace against Romania. At times Lothar Matth\u00e4us seemed to be playing not so much from memory as with amnesia. </p> <p>Of course Germany will be organised, methodical and resilient but with little invention; there is nothing hidden.

      "bodyText": "Calls for a new independent inquiry into the cause of the Mull of Kintyre helicopter crash six years ago were today rejected by the government. Armed forces minister John Spellar insisted the two pilots of the military Chinook which smashed into a hilltop on the Scottish peninsula had been rightly blamed for the accident. And he rejected claims that Scotland's top law officer, Lord Advocate Colin Boyd QC, had questioned whether the verdict was correct. The families of the pilots have repeatedly criticised the Ministry of Defence's original finding that the pilots were grossly negligent by breaking flying rules in bad weather. The accident killed 25 senior intelligence experts from Northern Ireland as well as Flight Lieutenants Jonathan Tapper and Richard Cook, experienced pilots who had unblemished records until the crash. In a letter to Kenny MacAskill MSP obtained by the BBC, Mr Boyd said Crown counsel had considered new evidence on possible technical malfunction. He said they had looked at information on the Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (Fadec) software fitted to the helicopter which had emerged after the fatal accident inquiry. Mr Boyd said the lawyers had also considered the RAF Board of Inquiry's findings and a National Audit Office report into accepting equipment off contract and into service. He wrote: \"Having regard to the findings of the sheriff, Crown counsel considered that, even if the new information could be substantiated in an inquiry process, it is highly unlikely that the findings of the sheriff would be different. \"Indeed insofar as the new information about Fadec invites speculation as to another possible cause for the crash of ZD576 it may be thought to reinforce the sheriff's inconclusive determination as to the cause of the accident.\" The sheriff had concluded that he could not be satisfied that the accident was caused by the crew's decision to overfly the Mull of Kintyre at cruising speed but selected the wrong rate of climb, which had been the RAF's finding. Mr Boyd said he proposed to take no further action on new evidence. And he wrote: \"As you know the terms of the RAF Board of Inquiry report and the determination by the RAF of the cause of the accident are a matter for the Ministry of Defence and not for me.\" But Mr Spellar told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that there was no new evidence that changed the MoD's original verdict. Insisting the pilots had been responsible, he said: \"By flying too fast and too low in fog and in a hilly area they were breaching safe flying rules.\" However, Mike Tapper, the father of Flt Lt Tapper, said the MoD dismissed any new evidence out of hand. \"It seems that the government would rather protect the elite within the MoD than to protect natural justice,\" he said. Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell questioned whether the Lord Advocate's letter represented a genuine step forward for those calling for the inquiry into the crash to be reopened. Mr Campbell, a Scottish QC, said: \"The Lord Advocate's letter does not challenge in any way the conclusion of the separate board of inquiry held by the RAF. It is that last decision which was flawed. \"It is essential to guard against over-enthusiastic interpretation of events, which could easily damage the cause of putting right the injustice suffered by these pilots and their families.\"",

      "body": "<p>\"Watch it. Oh we're hard because we're hard <br> Because by being hard we're being kind. <br> Because one day a world ago <br> The Leader read a book and lost his mind\" <br> - Jacky Jackson, home secretary </p> <p>The morning the massed revolutionary ranks of the Women's Institute humbled the Great Leader, the final chapter in his demise was being played out in a rehearsal room in Newcastle. It is the summer of 2004, and New Labour is facing certain electoral defeat. The \"project\", whatever that was, is long forgotten. Survival is all that matters now. Prime minister Richard Tallow, \"in a nod towards tradition\", retreats to Whitley Bay to make his conference plea for four more years. </p> <p>The TV news reports how \"The PM spoke of struggling for the souls/ Of the excluded and the rich alike./ Equipped with nothing but a mike,\" while his home secretary, Jacky Jackson, a rebel in his youth - who is \"hard as fuck on evil nowadays/Since that's the only policy that plays/Down where the Morlocks read the Daily Mail\" - mutters at the screen in his hotel room. \"So no one really wondered what this shit meant./After ideology comes noise/So, on the count of three, then, girls and boys.\" </p> <p>Had it been about any other sub ject, Laughter When We're Dead is the sort of play that would give David Blunkett multiple orgasms. It's a Jacobean revenge tragedy that Webster would have been proud of, written in iambic pentameters and rhyming couplets. Traditional values in a modern setting, precisely the worthy-sounding roughage on which to blunt young minds. But as you may have guessed, Laughter When We're Dead won't be making the school syllabus, not for a while anyway. </p> <p>It is not so much the home secretary's appetite for snack sex that is likely to keep it off, or that he prefers football to Daisy Gates, his fragrant and willing PPS - \"Later. I've got tickets for the match/But then I'll drink ambrosia from your snatch.\" No, this is the first piece of drama, and arguably the first piece of writing, really to get under the skin of the government. </p> <p>Last month Trevor Nunn, the director of the National Theatre, complained that no one was prepared to take on the big state-of-the-nation plays. He should get himself up to Newcastle quick and beg an introduction to Sean O'Brien. Where all those revues churned out by the usual suspects of superannuated establishment dissidents joke unfunnily about the nothingness within New Labour, here it scares the hell out of you. But the most dangerous thing of all about Laughter When We're Dead is that it's entertainment. This is the last thing you might expect from a verse play, had it not come from O'Brien or through Live Theatre, the Newcastle stable from which sprang Peter Flannery (Our Friends in the North) and Lee Hall (Spoonface Steinberg and Cooking With Elvis). </p> <p>Poets are not supposed to rattle governments, even those like O'Brien whose hefty physical presence seems ideally suited to rocking the pillars of the temple. His verse, which has won him the Forward and every other paltry prize that keeps poets off the streets, is just as muscular. You can hear its strength and his trademark dactyls in the work of the many younger poets he has influenced. </p> <p>Still, O'Brien is an unlikely nemesis. He's no firebrand class warrior (\"Private school and Oxford, actually\") nor Old Labour nostalgic either. It's a hatred of cant that drove him towards drama. \"The intellectual impoverishment of politics in this country is shameful, and it is getting worse. It's all gesture and no policy or real analysis,\" he says. \"I was standing at the bus stop this morning in what happens to be Stephen Byers's constituency thinking he may as well be on the moon for all he has to do with my life, or anyone else's who lives here. Despite Gordon Brown's occasional railings against upper middle-class bias at Oxford and Cambridge, it's there in politics too. What we now have in this country is a permanent political class, a caste even - and I am not just talking about political advisors here - who owe no allegiance to anyone, least of all the people who voted them in. </p> <p>\"You get curious reversals of normal polarities in such circumstances. You get Blair going to address the WI, and getting himself heckled by the most well-behaved people outside the synod of the Church of England. He thinks they are all mugs. They know he thinks they are all mugs and they are not having it any more.\" </p> <p>At the heart of O'Brien's play is the tragedy of the wayward, increasingly reactionary Jackson and his wife Elizabeth, a human rights lawyer, who has sacrificed her own happiness for his and the party's sake. \"A partnership of principle outlives/Mere human error: partnership forgives,\" she says. </p> <p>\"Jackson is like many in New Labour who started out on the left but who have travelled a long way since,\" says O'Brien. \"As distinctions of left and right have collapsed, no one knows why they are doing it anymore. So staying in power becomes the only objective. When Elizabeth tells him it's a wonder he's not bugging people's dreams, he jokes back that that's the 'first among my post-election schemes'.\" </p> <p>Jackson's real agony is that he once believed in something better, but now no longer can. All that's left is what O'Brien calls the \"Stalinist instincts you'll find in many old left-wingers\". And so when one of his constituents mistakes him for a Tyne Tees weatherman during the fateful night of his return to the Toon, Jackson vents his frustration on the \"Neds\" who blindly vote in him: </p> <p>\"You're old, you're pissed, you're ignorant, you're poor, <br> The son of a dole-wallah and a hoor. <br> I've spent my lifetime hoping for the best <br> From twats like you. You've failed the fuckin' test\" </p> <p>O'Brien said he was attracted to Jacobean revenge tragedy by its atmosphere of corruption and repression. The internal politics of New Labour, he says, is essentially the politics of the medieval court, where the spin-doctor courtiers pull all the strings. </p> <p>\"We have had effectively one-party rule here locally in the north for a long time. Newcastle has had a reputation in the past for corruption. As with anywhere else, when there's money to be made, you can be sure there will be people willing to take the opportunity. I wanted to set it against that kind of backdrop just when everything is coming apart at the seams, as they will eventually.\" </p> <p>Director Max Roberts, who has already brought Cooking With Elvis to the West End this year from his small theatre in the shadow of the Tyne bridge, said Laughter When We're Dead demands a national audi ence. \"It may be written in iambic pentameters, but it is also written to be seen by a lot of people. It's a great story. Like Flannery's work it is not just for the bourgeois radical elite. When was the last time you went to the National and saw a play about Liverpool or Newcastle or Glasgow that spoke to the whole nation? I don't want to sound like a bitter northerner, but good plays are universal. Just because they come from the regions doesn't make them any less good.\" </p> <p>Laughter When We're Dead is a staggering piece of poetry. Tonight will decide if it hits the same heights as theatre. But one more thing is sure. For the cabinet, if they can bear to look, it stands as a terrible warning. Whether, like the great jam-maker's revolt, it will be heeded, is another thing. </p> <p>\u0095 Laughter When We're Dead previews from tonight at Live Theatre, Quayside, Newcastle upon Tyne (0191-232 2224). Till June 29.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"Watch it. Oh we're hard because we're hard Because by being hard we're being kind. Because one day a world ago The Leader read a book and lost his mind\" - Jacky Jackson, home secretary The morning the massed revolutionary ranks of the Women's Institute humbled the Great Leader, the final chapter in his demise was being played out in a rehearsal room in Newcastle. It is the summer of 2004, and New Labour is facing certain electoral defeat. The \"project\", whatever that was, is long forgotten. Survival is all that matters now. Prime minister Richard Tallow, \"in a nod towards tradition\", retreats to Whitley Bay to make his conference plea for four more years. The TV news reports how \"The PM spoke of struggling for the souls/ Of the excluded and the rich alike./ Equipped with nothing but a mike,\" while his home secretary, Jacky Jackson, a rebel in his youth - who is \"hard as fuck on evil nowadays/Since that's the only policy that plays/Down where the Morlocks read the Daily Mail\" - mutters at the screen in his hotel room. \"So no one really wondered what this shit meant./After ideology comes noise/So, on the count of three, then, girls and boys.\" Had it been about any other sub ject, Laughter When We're Dead is the sort of play that would give David Blunkett multiple orgasms. It's a Jacobean revenge tragedy that Webster would have been proud of, written in iambic pentameters and rhyming couplets. Traditional values in a modern setting, precisely the worthy-sounding roughage on which to blunt young minds. But as you may have guessed, Laughter When We're Dead won't be making the school syllabus, not for a while anyway. It is not so much the home secretary's appetite for snack sex that is likely to keep it off, or that he prefers football to Daisy Gates, his fragrant and willing PPS - \"Later. I've got tickets for the match/But then I'll drink ambrosia from your snatch.\" No, this is the first piece of drama, and arguably the first piece of writing, really to get under the skin of the government. Last month Trevor Nunn, the director of the National Theatre, complained that no one was prepared to take on the big state-of-the-nation plays. He should get himself up to Newcastle quick and beg an introduction to Sean O'Brien. Where all those revues churned out by the usual suspects of superannuated establishment dissidents joke unfunnily about the nothingness within New Labour, here it scares the hell out of you. But the most dangerous thing of all about Laughter When We're Dead is that it's entertainment. This is the last thing you might expect from a verse play, had it not come from O'Brien or through Live Theatre, the Newcastle stable from which sprang Peter Flannery (Our Friends in the North) and Lee Hall (Spoonface Steinberg and Cooking With Elvis). Poets are not supposed to rattle governments, even those like O'Brien whose hefty physical presence seems ideally suited to rocking the pillars of the temple. His verse, which has won him the Forward and every other paltry prize that keeps poets off the streets, is just as muscular. You can hear its strength and his trademark dactyls in the work of the many younger poets he has influenced. Still, O'Brien is an unlikely nemesis. He's no firebrand class warrior (\"Private school and Oxford, actually\") nor Old Labour nostalgic either. It's a hatred of cant that drove him towards drama. \"The intellectual impoverishment of politics in this country is shameful, and it is getting worse. It's all gesture and no policy or real analysis,\" he says. \"I was standing at the bus stop this morning in what happens to be Stephen Byers's constituency thinking he may as well be on the moon for all he has to do with my life, or anyone else's who lives here. Despite Gordon Brown's occasional railings against upper middle-class bias at Oxford and Cambridge, it's there in politics too. What we now have in this country is a permanent political class, a caste even - and I am not just talking about political advisors here - who owe no allegiance to anyone, least of all the people who voted them in. \"You get curious reversals of normal polarities in such circumstances. You get Blair going to address the WI, and getting himself heckled by the most well-behaved people outside the synod of the Church of England. He thinks they are all mugs. They know he thinks they are all mugs and they are not having it any more.\" At the heart of O'Brien's play is the tragedy of the wayward, increasingly reactionary Jackson and his wife Elizabeth, a human rights lawyer, who has sacrificed her own happiness for his and the party's sake. \"A partnership of principle outlives/Mere human error: partnership forgives,\" she says. \"Jackson is like many in New Labour who started out on the left but who have travelled a long way since,\" says O'Brien. \"As distinctions of left and right have collapsed, no one knows why they are doing it anymore. So staying in power becomes the only objective. When Elizabeth tells him it's a wonder he's not bugging people's dreams, he jokes back that that's the 'first among my post-election schemes'.\" Jackson's real agony is that he once believed in something better, but now no longer can. All that's left is what O'Brien calls the \"Stalinist instincts you'll find in many old left-wingers\". And so when one of his constituents mistakes him for a Tyne Tees weatherman during the fateful night of his return to the Toon, Jackson vents his frustration on the \"Neds\" who blindly vote in him: \"You're old, you're pissed, you're ignorant, you're poor, The son of a dole-wallah and a hoor. I've spent my lifetime hoping for the best From twats like you. You've failed the fuckin' test\" O'Brien said he was attracted to Jacobean revenge tragedy by its atmosphere of corruption and repression. The internal politics of New Labour, he says, is essentially the politics of the medieval court, where the spin-doctor courtiers pull all the strings. \"We have had effectively one-party rule here locally in the north for a long time. Newcastle has had a reputation in the past for corruption. As with anywhere else, when there's money to be made, you can be sure there will be people willing to take the opportunity. I wanted to set it against that kind of backdrop just when everything is coming apart at the seams, as they will eventually.\" Director Max Roberts, who has already brought Cooking With Elvis to the West End this year from his small theatre in the shadow of the Tyne bridge, said Laughter When We're Dead demands a national audi ence. \"It may be written in iambic pentameters, but it is also written to be seen by a lot of people. It's a great story. Like Flannery's work it is not just for the bourgeois radical elite. When was the last time you went to the National and saw a play about Liverpool or Newcastle or Glasgow that spoke to the whole nation? I don't want to sound like a bitter northerner, but good plays are universal. Just because they come from the regions doesn't make them any less good.\" Laughter When We're Dead is a staggering piece of poetry. Tonight will decide if it hits the same heights as theatre. But one more thing is sure. For the cabinet, if they can bear to look, it stands as a terrible warning. Whether, like the great jam-maker's revolt, it will be heeded, is another thing. \u0095 Laughter When We're Dead previews from tonight at Live Theatre, Quayside, Newcastle upon Tyne (0191-232 2224). Till June 29.",

On the second day of the historic three-day summit between the leaders, Kim Jong-il questioned the way he has been portrayed as a villain by the west. The United States has long described his heavily armed country as a dangerous, rogue nation. \"The western media wonder why I am leading a reclusive life, and they say a recluse made his first public appearance\" yesterday by greeting Kim Dae-jung at its airport, Kim Jong-il said at the summit in the North Korean capital Pyongyang. \"But I have visited China and Indonesia in the past, and also made many unofficial visits overseas.

The peninsula's rail and road lines were closed around 1948, when the two Koreas formed their own governments and sealed their border. After the 1950-53 Korean war ended, the two sides turned the border into the most heavily armed one in the world, including the 37,000 US soldiers who are stationed in South Korea to protect it against possible attacks by the North. By reopening these routes, the two countries could promote trade and business deals that are desperately needed by the North's ailing economy and eventually reunite many Korean families. Since the 1990s, North Korea has been dependent on food aid from its traditional foes: South Korea, Japan and the United States. Desperation for economic aid is believed to be a major factor in driving the North to agree to the summit. Despite repeated warnings by Seoul officials not to expect too much from the talks, the unexpectedly warm welcome for the South Korean leader led to speculation that the North may finally be willing to shed its self-imposed isolation, or even to follow the lead of China in beginning to opening up its economy to global capitalism. However, no formal agreements were reported by the 50 South Korean journalists who were allowed to travel to Pyongyang for the summit and were providing the only information available to hundreds of foreign journalists who were restricted to covering the meetings from Seoul, South Korea. Korea's leaders have a host of thorny issues to resolve, including the North's long-range missile and nuclear programmes and the 37,000 US troops deployed in the South. Reunification - the goal of both Koreas - is likely to be a lengthy, difficult process. Some international observers said Kim Jong-il may simply have used the elaborate welcoming ceremony to play down his reputation in the west as a reclusive communist, in a bid for further economic assistance. Nevertheless, applause broke out at offices and in homes across South Korea the moment that Kim Dae-jung set foot on North Korean soil, with some people shedding tears of joy. UN secretary-general Kofi Annan saluted \"the vision and wisdom\" of the two leaders in opening the historic dialogue, the UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said.",

Gordon Brown is as strongly in favour of the single currency as I am, but I think his preferred tactics were just to keep talking about his five economic conditions and otherwise to keep quiet about it until after the election. I don't agree with those tactics. I think the article today shows that Tony Blair doesn't either.\" Mr Portillo told the Institute of Economic Affairs that Mr Blair's opinion on the issue varied from day to day. \"Some days we are told that he has taken personal charge of the campaign for the euro. On other days, he agrees with Gordon Brown that secrecy is the best policy. Occasionally, particularly before an election, we hear of his deep, heartfelt love for the pound. \"The prime minister's answer to the divisions in the cabinet about the euro is simple: he agrees with everyone.\" Mr Byers, announcing 1,200 new jobs in Nottingham created by US inward investment, denied any cabinet rift over the single currency. He said: \"The cabinet are of one view over the euro.\" Mrs Beckett also insisted that there was no row, saying: \"I don't accept there is an argument raging.\"",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair is to meet the French president Jacques Chirac tomorrow night in Downing Street in a bid to test the extent of Franco-German determination to run the euro, and the European economy, without formally consulting the British. Mr Chirac is also expected to outline plans to extend the principle of majority voting within the EU and allowing an inner core of countries to cooperate more closely using the community's institutions. The president, fresh from last week's successful Franco-German summit, will set out his country's plans for the presidency of the EU, starting next month. Both the French and Germans are pressing for big changes to prepare the EU for enlargement to the east. The Germans also favour making majority voting the norm and want an increase in the size of its vote on the council of ministers. But the Foreign Office hopes that the French are not going to accept the full federalist agenda, recently set out by Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister. Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, has been delighted by an article in Le Monde by his French counterpart, Hubert Vedrine, seen as a delicate slap-down to Mr Fischer. Mr Vedrine insisted Europe had to exist by concensus and there was no point tabling proposals that merely exacerbated divisions within the EU. Mr Chirac is also expected to report on plans for closer Franco-German cooperation in military satellites and on heavy military air transport. Mr Blair has set great store by discreetly breaking up the traditional Franco-German axis at the heart of the EU, but he has found his efforts increasingly constrained by the British government's indecision over the euro. The French, along with the Belgians, are pressing for the 11 countries inside the euro - the euro 11 - to take more decisions not just on the single currency, but also on the European macro-economy. Lionel Jospin, the French prime minister has told his parliament: \"We must strengthen the role of the euro-11 and focus on coordination of our economic policies in an endeavour to improve the visibility of economic policy of the eurozone. British diplomats said last night that no formal proposals have been put forward by the French. But one controversial idea is that when a country outside the euro holds the EU rotating's presidency, it could be asked to give its observer status at meetings of the European Central Bank to a country from inside the single currency area.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair last night faced a revolt over Labour's election manifesto after a comprehensive challenge was launched within the party to a range of government policies. The prime minister is heading for a showdown with trade union leaders and constituency activists who have tabled hundreds of hostile amendments to documents intended to form the basis of his election platform. His critics intend to use the party's policy-making process in an attempt to commit him to everything from a higher minimum wage and pensions to ditching directly elected mayors and retaining first-past-the-post elections. The offensive is the most sustained drive to change the direction of New Labour policies since he succeeded John Smith six years ago and reflects growing rank-and-file unease with Mr Blair. The detailed amendments to six internal party policy papers drawn up with the involvement of ministers will be discussed by Labour's national policy forum in Exeter on July 7. The documents are supposed to represent a draft of Labour's manifesto but Mr Blair will be opposed to a number of proposals that have widespread backing. A party loyalist on the forum said last night: \"It looks horrific. I can't see how they can get him round it. This threatens to be the first time they have turned him over big time. \"He's going to say, 'Come on lads, behave, it's the last conference before the election.' They're saying they know that, and that's why they think they can get something out if him.\" Ministers and senior offi cials in Labour's Millbank HQ are expected to launch a counter-offensive before next month's meeting to get amendments withdrawn or rally support for more acceptable versions. The revolt looms as Mr Blair struggles to assert his authority and end a series of splits, rows and disasters such as the handbagging last week by the Women's Institute. Six policy documents are up for debate in Exeter: the economy; Britain in the world; education and employment; democracy and citizenship; industry, culture and agriculture; and the environment, transport and the regions. Opposition to proposals to hold a referendum on proportional representation to appease the Liberal Democrats, seen as potential coalition partners by Mr Blair, is spearheaded by the GMB general union and Usdaw, the shopworkers. Both argue for the retention of the existing system and Usdaw also proposes the rejection of Lord Jenkins's modified PR system, though some constituencies support a referendum. Big increases in the state pension and restoration of the linking to average earnings, opposed by Gordon Brown, are championed by Unison, the TGWU transport workers and the GMB. Usdaw wants the minimum wage to apply to 16- and 17-year-olds, and other unions support extending the \u00a33.60 adult rate to 21-year-olds. Bill Morris and the TGWU are demanding a review - probably leading to abolition - of asylum vouchers, and denounce plans to demand bonds from some visitors as \"morally wrong and inherently racist\". Improved rights in the workplace, including better protection from the sack and making the 48-hour week a legal maximum to end volunteering for longer shifts, are also well supported. The re-creation of a \"publicly owned and publicly accountable rail network\" is demanded by the RMT rail workers, backed by TSSA clerks. Both unions also oppose selling off London Underground. The AEEU engineers call for a 50% turnout floor before mayors are elected, which if adopted would in effect halt the experiment in its tracks - just 33.6% voted in London. Europe and the euro will also be a battleground with pressure building for early entry into the single currency at a low rate. Drawing up policies through the national policy forum was intended to foster consensus and avoid rows at the party's annual September conference. But unions and activists have learned to \"play the game\", according to one Westminster source. Trade unions, guaranteed about 30 of the policy forum's 160 seats, have started horse-trading to guarantee that their priorities succeed. A vote by 35 members is officially recognised as a \"minority\" position, enabling supporters to put it before September's conference. \"There is an incredible job of political management ahead if this is to be defused before the conference,\" said the Westminster source. \"Unions and constituencies have worked out how to use the system and look like exploiting it.\"",

      "bodyText": "Hafez al-Assad, the \"Lion of Damascus\", returned last night to his home village of Qurdaha in the mountains that overlook the Mediterranean. His burial in the family mausoleum marked the end of 30 years of rule in which he kept Syria one of the most closed societies in the world and opened the way for a new and potentially forward-looking generation led by his son Bashar. The homecoming of the late president, 69, to the green heartland of his Alawite sect - now a potentially vulnerable minority if Bashar fails to consolidate power - was accompanied by chaotic and frenetic scenes as mourners broke through a security cordon to prostrate themselves across the coffin. The Qurdaha ceremony came after a day-long state funeral that had transformed Damascus into a sea of black flags and banners. Tens of thousands had taken to the streets to pay their last respects to a politician who had been ruthless but provided the country with a semblance of stability. While the turnout was substantial, however, there was not the huge swell that might have been expected for such a long-lasting leader - a reflection, perhaps, of his mixed legacy among Syrians. His portrait remained on display just about everywhere, but often draped in black sashes. And now proliferating were pictures of the 34-year-old son he hoped would hold on to power, Bashar al-Assad. For much of the route through Damascus a sprawling army of mourners, dressed all in black, marched alongside the coffin. Their wailing was mingled with chants of support for Bashar. Thirst for change In heat that was brutal even in the early morning, mourners were constantly fainting and being lifted away to safety. Some men tore open their flesh in a manic show of support. But spite of such sporadic displays of intense grief, the mood in the crowd towards Assad was for the most part respectful rather than warm. A student in a black headband said he had lined the route because \"Assad had been Syria's leader throughout my lifetime\". Others in the crowd spoke cautiously about change and hoped Bashar could provide stability. Wearing a dark suit and sunglasses, Bashar the shy president in waiting, followed the coffin, which was covered in the red, white and black of the Syrian flag. The gangly young man towering over soldiers and other mourners following the coffin had led a quiet life until called back to Syria from his training in Britain as an ophthalmologist after the 1994 death in a car crash of his elder brother Basil, the political heir apparent. The only public opposition so far has been from Bashar's exiled uncle, Rifaat, 63, though yesterday there were some conciliatory sounds from that quarter when Rifaat's son in London spoke to the Guardian. But once Syria's political class emerges from mourning, Bashar will face the challenge of holding dynastic power in a state that is not a monarchy. Representatives from more than 50 governments queued for five hours to pay their respects as the coffin lay in state yesterday in the so-called People's Palace on a hill overlooking Damascus. Bashar bent to have a word with each of them, occasionally breaking off to sit down for a slightly longer chat. He appeared nonplussed by his sudden immersion in the world of diplomacy but the US state department said it was excited about the possibility of real change. The US secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, described him as poised for leadership. Some Syrians complained that President Clinton's failure to attend the was a snub and wondered why he had passed up the opportunity to get off to a good start with Bashar, and possibly revive the Middle East peace process. Assad, one of Israel's most implacable opponents, had failed to reach a settlement with Jerusalem in talks spanning nine years on the disputed Golan Heights. Leaders absent Apart from President Chirac of France, few western leaders attended yesterday's funeral, though many Middle Eastern leaders were there, including Yasser Arafat, head of the Palestinian authority who had once been imprisoned in Damascus by Assad. From the People's Palace the coffin was carried on a gun carriage and flown part of the way north on a Syrian Airlines plane before going on by road on to Qurdaha. Assad had been brought up in the village in relative poverty, the ninth in a family of 11 children. Thousands turned up from all over Syria to line his final route. Close to sunset beneath a minaret, Assad was placed in the mausoleum beside Basil, the tough-minded son who had been groomed to take over. The crowds on the road to Qurdaha seemed bigger and the feeling among them more intense than in Damascus. With Assad in power, the Shia Muslim Alawite sect from which he emerged felt protected despite Syria's large Sunni majority. With his death, some must be wondering what will happen to them if Bashar fails to retain power. Now Bashar is left to face the first conference of the Ba'ath party for 15 years, due this weekend, and the challenge of reviving a stagnant economy, a closed society and a peace process. Last Post For the moment, western journalists in Damascus and Qurdaha were surprised to find themselves virtually free yesterday to go where they liked and speak to whomever they wanted without the usual ministry minders from a government that had been paranoid about foreign media. It may have been that the regime was too distracted by the funeral to worry, or there were just too many journalists for the machinery to cope. Optimists were hoping that it was the first sign that the government under Bashar is going to take a more relaxed view of the outside world. The day ended 12 hours after the coffin left President Assad's modest house in Damascus to travel to his northern home. There military commanders formed a line on one side of the square outside the mausoleum in Qurdaha, the holy men in their black gowns and white caps formed another and Assad's political colleagues, in dark western suits, yet another. As the last rays of the sun turned the stone of the mausoleum pink the white, the Last Post was sounded for the man who had been the first member of his family to leave the village.

Complaining that the government was sticking to \"too many policies of the old John Major agenda\", the London mayor called on the prime minister to reposition Labour to the left of centre in the run-up to the general election, rather than \"seek enemies\" to define himself against. After more than a month of quiet coalition building - punctuated with emollient speeches to City audiences - Mr Livingstone launched himself into the debate on the government's difficulties. The challenge from a Conservative party that was set on imitating the Austrian neo-fascist Jorg Haider was a threat to everyone, he declared, advising Tony Blair to build a \"broad social coalition\" that would deliver real improvements in people's quality of life. Downing Street said the mayor was \"perfectly entitled to his view\". But at Millbank headquarters one official said: \"The man is in permanent opposition,\" adding that Mr Livingstone's consensual approach reflected his need to put together a team and a programme for London.

The move bolsters hopes that investor confidence is returning to the high-technology sector after the sharp stock market sell-off during April and May. Telecity, which provides facilities for housing hardware and high-performance inter net connections, is expected to be valued at around \u00a3580m by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank handling the public offer - some \u00a3110m less than the value indicated last month. The company operates internet exchanges that provide customers such as QXL.com and UUNet with web connections through a choice of telecommunications carriers including British Telecommunications, Cable &amp; Wireless and NTL. Its six exchanges, spread between Manchester, London and a number of European cities promise 24-hour engineering support to prevent websites from being forced offline. Mike Kelly, the former Manchester University computer scientist who established the company in 1998, is believed to want to raise cash to fund European expansion with a long-term target of opening up to 40 new exchanges across Europe. Just over 20% of the company will be offered to investors. It is estimated that each new exchange, housing banks of servers and routers, costs around \u00a37m to open, while the European market for internet exchanges is said to be worth at around \u00a33bn. American rivals, such as Exodus Communications and Abovenet Communications, can command multi-billion dollar valuations. Analysts point out that while investors have remained leery of business-to-consumer internet businesses, hi-tech infrastructure companies have continued to draw interest from fund managers. The flotation of Telecity will also come as a relief to venture capital group 3i, which owns about 40% of the company.",

      "body": "<p>One in 10 people who are admitted to hospital will be damaged by medical errors which cost the health service \u00a32bn to put right, it was acknowledged yesterday as the government unveiled ambitious proposals to transform the blame culture inside the NHS and learn from mistakes. </p> <p>Every year around 850,000 patients admitted to hospitals suffer some sort of harm - usually of a minor nature but sometimes serious - according to a report published yesterday by Liam Donaldson, the government's chief medical officer. Preventable tragedies include the deaths of children wrongly given injections in their spine and babies who were stillborn because the monitor that should have registered their distress was recording the mother's heartbeat and not that of the foetus. </p> <p>Proposing a new early warning system, which will have a computerised central register of error, Professor Donaldson said the scale of what nearly goes wrong was even greater, but the NHS was failing to learn from its mistakes. </p> <p>\"For every major injury, there are 30 minor ones, but 300 that could have ended in injury and don't,\" he said. Those 300 he likened to aircraft near-misses and said they represented a wasted opportunity. Like the aircraft industry of several decades ago, the NHS ignored the \"free lessons\" that could be learned from what were almost tragedies. </p> <p>The admission of the scale of medical error - which has been estimated by outsiders but not acknowledged by government - and Prof Donaldson's proposals to lift the veil of secrecy and fear among medical staff which has hidden it in the past, came as government inspectors were sent in yesterday to investigate the hiring of locum doctors at four NHS trusts which employed James Elwood. </p> <p>A review of the work of the 78-year-old pathologist found an unacceptably high rate of error in the laboratory tests he did to confirm diagnoses of cancer. It found that seven patients were wrongly diagnosed and suffered serious conse quences. Another patient whose case is being reinvestigated may require \"further significant\" treatment. The diagnosis for 215 others has been revised but the consequences are said to be less serious. </p> <p>The commission for health improvement - the government's health inspectorate - will examine why the NHS trusts employed the retired doctor. The MSF union that represents pathology staff yesterday blamed staff shortages. \"With graduate trainees in pathology laboratories starting on as little as \u00a39,700 it is no wonder that the NHS is facing a recruitment crisis.\" </p> <p>Prof Donaldson said the Elwood affair highlighted the need to ensure that the NHS learned from errors. \"While the majority of clinical care provided by the NHS is of excellent standard, too often, as these recent reviews show, we have seen tragedies which may have been avoided if the lessons of the past had been properly learned,\" he said. </p> <p>The Elwood scandal follows other prominent cases in which doctors have failed their patients, from the murdering GP Harold Shipman to the blundering gynaecologist Rodney Ledward whose operations on hundreds of women in Kent went wrong. A second gynaecologist, Richard Neale, faces being struck off by the General Medical Council, which has just begun hearing the allegations of 14 patients relating to botched operations, incompetence and arrogance. </p> <p>Dr Elwood was condemned yesterday for refusing to help investigators who had been asking him from July last year to provide details of where he had worked and why he had opted to remove himself from the medical register, which means he cannot be disciplined. Last night he issued a statement saying he was now prepared to cooperate. </p> <p>Prof Donaldson said yesterday that he wanted to get away from the culture of blame within the NHS. \"The culture of the past has not encouraged reporting and analysis of adverse incidents,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "One in 10 people who are admitted to hospital will be damaged by medical errors which cost the health service \u00a32bn to put right, it was acknowledged yesterday as the government unveiled ambitious proposals to transform the blame culture inside the NHS and learn from mistakes. Every year around 850,000 patients admitted to hospitals suffer some sort of harm - usually of a minor nature but sometimes serious - according to a report published yesterday by Liam Donaldson, the government's chief medical officer. Preventable tragedies include the deaths of children wrongly given injections in their spine and babies who were stillborn because the monitor that should have registered their distress was recording the mother's heartbeat and not that of the foetus. Proposing a new early warning system, which will have a computerised central register of error, Professor Donaldson said the scale of what nearly goes wrong was even greater, but the NHS was failing to learn from its mistakes. \"For every major injury, there are 30 minor ones, but 300 that could have ended in injury and don't,\" he said. Those 300 he likened to aircraft near-misses and said they represented a wasted opportunity. Like the aircraft industry of several decades ago, the NHS ignored the \"free lessons\" that could be learned from what were almost tragedies. The admission of the scale of medical error - which has been estimated by outsiders but not acknowledged by government - and Prof Donaldson's proposals to lift the veil of secrecy and fear among medical staff which has hidden it in the past, came as government inspectors were sent in yesterday to investigate the hiring of locum doctors at four NHS trusts which employed James Elwood. A review of the work of the 78-year-old pathologist found an unacceptably high rate of error in the laboratory tests he did to confirm diagnoses of cancer. It found that seven patients were wrongly diagnosed and suffered serious conse quences. Another patient whose case is being reinvestigated may require \"further significant\" treatment. The diagnosis for 215 others has been revised but the consequences are said to be less serious. The commission for health improvement - the government's health inspectorate - will examine why the NHS trusts employed the retired doctor. The MSF union that represents pathology staff yesterday blamed staff shortages. \"With graduate trainees in pathology laboratories starting on as little as \u00a39,700 it is no wonder that the NHS is facing a recruitment crisis.\" Prof Donaldson said the Elwood affair highlighted the need to ensure that the NHS learned from errors. \"While the majority of clinical care provided by the NHS is of excellent standard, too often, as these recent reviews show, we have seen tragedies which may have been avoided if the lessons of the past had been properly learned,\" he said. The Elwood scandal follows other prominent cases in which doctors have failed their patients, from the murdering GP Harold Shipman to the blundering gynaecologist Rodney Ledward whose operations on hundreds of women in Kent went wrong. A second gynaecologist, Richard Neale, faces being struck off by the General Medical Council, which has just begun hearing the allegations of 14 patients relating to botched operations, incompetence and arrogance. Dr Elwood was condemned yesterday for refusing to help investigators who had been asking him from July last year to provide details of where he had worked and why he had opted to remove himself from the medical register, which means he cannot be disciplined. Last night he issued a statement saying he was now prepared to cooperate. Prof Donaldson said yesterday that he wanted to get away from the culture of blame within the NHS. \"The culture of the past has not encouraged reporting and analysis of adverse incidents,\" he said. When things go wrong - whether serious or minor - he hopes doctors, nurses and other staff will report them confidentially to the central register. If a pattern of poor performance or avoidable error becomes plain, the inspectors would be sent in. Information that emerges will be put together with the data from 15,000 litigation cases that the NHS has outstanding. \"Nobody has bothered to look in the past at what we can learn from them,\" he said. \"It is a rich seam for the NHS.\" Other information will be added from the reporting systems for the side effects of drugs and medical devices, together with the confidential inquiries that are compiled into aspects of surgery. Targets will be set to ensure persistent errors are ruled out. By 2001 Prof Donaldson wants to see no more patients dying or paralysed by spinal injections, while suicides by mental patients using shower curtain rails must end by 2005. The British Medical Association said yesterday it supported the proposals. \"Such a system could well have stopped some of the problems that have recently come to light,\" said its chairman, Ian Bogle. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, gave an enthusiastic welcome to what he called an \"excellent report\", saying he had asked Prof Donaldson to put his recommendations into effect immediately. \"The issues are complex, but patients, staff and the public have the right to expect the NHS to learn from its mistakes so we can ensure the alarm bells ring when there are genuine concerns so they can be nipped in the bud.\"",

The child was allowed to <strong> eat and drink</strong> before his chemotherapy, which was to take place under general anaesthetic, when he should have been fasted. There were <strong> no beds</strong> available on the cancer ward, so he had to go to a mixed-speciality area. His <strong> notes</strong> were lost.

      "bodyText": "For every Harold Shipman who goes around killing his patients there are thousands of well-intentioned, competent doctors and nurses who make the occasional mistake. Sometimes these have very serious consequences. In the past, the chief medical officer's report published yesterday points out, there has been no reporting system and no central analysis of what goes wrong and how it might be prevented. And so history repeats itself. There have been 13 cases of people, mainly children, being killed or paralysed after drugs were wrongly injected into the spine. Twelve involved the injection of a group of anti-can cer drugs called vinca alkaloids, given to leukaemia patients, which are almost always fatal if they go into the spine instead of the arm. An analysis of the death of one of these children reveals a catalogue of mistakes. The child was allowed to eat and drink before his chemotherapy, which was to take place under general anaesthetic, when he should have been fasted. There were no beds available on the cancer ward, so he had to go to a mixed-speciality area. His notes were lost. There was no cancer nurse on the ward because of shortages so a housekeeper brought two drugs to his bedside, one for spinal injection and the other into a vein, that should have been kept apart. A junior doctor used the confusing abbreviations IV and IT for intravenous and intrathecal (into the spine) on the prescription. Because of the fasting problem, the treatment was postponed and a different doctor took over, who had not been briefed. The senior registrar was called to give the chemotherapy was unable to leave his ward and told the anaesthetist to go ahead, not realising two drugs had been delivered. The inexperienced anaesthetist injected the wrong drug , vincristine, into the child's spine. The boy died five days later.",

      "bodyText": "Prisoners are committing suicide in record numbers while ministers drag their feet on implementing a prevention scheme which has succeeded in the US, the chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, said yesterday. Record numbers of inmates killed themselves for the second year running last year, with the toll rising from 82 to 91. Sir David warned at the launch of his annual report on jails in England and Wales that the total could be higher this year. A Home Office spokesman said later that the number so far this year was 37. The home secretary, Jack Straw, had promised a pilot scheme last September but it had not yet materialised, said Sir David. \"America had the same situation we are going through here and they solved it through a very imaginative piece of work,\" he added. \"Why not give it a go. What we have now is not working.\" Under the US scheme a mental health nurse was on duty at every prison 24 hours a day, officers were trained to spot mental health problems and prisoners were paid to act as observers, reporting problems among fellow inmates. Sir David said there were only five suicides last year in US federal prisons, which hold 123,000. In New York prisons only two inmates killed themselves. The chief inspector launched a renewed attack on prison officers' attitudes towards prisoners and the role played by their union, the Prison Officers Association. Prison culture was changing, he said. Four years ago good staff had stood out from the bad, but now the bad stood out from the good. The last year had seen some of the worst examples of unacceptable behaviour such as officers ruling by fear at Wandsworth prison, south London, and others facing criminal assault charges at Wormwood Scrubs, west London. By failing to condemn such behaviour the POA \"gives the impression that it is in favour of it\". Questioning of prisoners revealed that many feared for their safety in prison and reported that they had been badly treated on entry. In Wandsworth, only 42% reported that they never feared for their safety. Sir David also used his report to renew his attacks on prison drug policy and the scarcity and inconsistency of education and training. With 60% of inmates at some prisons using heroin when they were admitted, taking the percentage testing positive for cannabis as a measure of drug problems was not an adequate response, he said. A prison service spokeswoman said one of the recommendations on suicide prevention from Sir David's review last September was being piloted.",

In 1998, 7% fewer transplants were carried out than in 1997, while waiting lists increased by 3%. Last year there was no change in the number of the transplants, but the waiting list grew by 3%.</p> <p>Part of this is due to fewer fatal car accidents because of seat belt legislation. But efforts to increase the donor pool by advertisements urging people to carry donor cards have not been successful. At the same time, transplant technology has improved, allowing more people to have the operation.</p> <p>But patients and their doctors are now frustrated by long waiting lists, which for many means a steady deterioration in their condition. From 1995-1999, about 1,000 patients died while waiting for a heart, heart and lung, lung or liver transplant. Many more will have died before even reaching the waiting list - and the number does not include those who die because there are insufficient dialysis facilities, says the BMA.</p> <p>The situation contrasts with some of Europe's success stories, notably Spain. Robert Sells, a transplant surgeon in Liverpool, said Spain had transformed its transplant service from having a shortage to exporting surplus organs to neighbouring countries.</p> <p>\"In 1985 a nephrologist [kidney specialist] who was politically very active pointed out to the government that Spain was lagging behind not only in health care but was practically the lowest supplier of donated organs and huge numbers of people were dying.</p> <p>\"In 1986, a law was passed that allowed obligatory donation unless a refusal was registered in the national computer. That was converted to a a veto from a family in serious distress being allowable.\"</p> <p>The kidney specialist became health secretary, and has instituted a system of transplant co-ordinators based in Spain's hospitals that is the envy of UK doctors. The result, said Professor Sells, is that Spain leads Europe, having increased its organ donation from five per million to 31. Other countries with opt-out donor schemes are close behind - the Czech Republic is second with about 28 per million, then Belgium with 26. In the UK there are 15 per million.</p> <p>But although the BMA voted in favour of an opt-out system at its annual conference last year, its leaders feel public opinion is not ready for the change. It also points out that there are shortages of surgeons to perform the transplants and, critically, of intensive care beds. Unless these problems are overcome, an opt-out scheme would not solve anything.</p>",

From 1995-1999, about 1,000 patients died while waiting for a heart, heart and lung, lung or liver transplant. Many more will have died before even reaching the waiting list - and the number does not include those who die because there are insufficient dialysis facilities, says the BMA. The situation contrasts with some of Europe's success stories, notably Spain. Robert Sells, a transplant surgeon in Liverpool, said Spain had transformed its transplant service from having a shortage to exporting surplus organs to neighbouring countries. \"In 1985 a nephrologist [kidney specialist] who was politically very active pointed out to the government that Spain was lagging behind not only in health care but was practically the lowest supplier of donated organs and huge numbers of people were dying. \"In 1986, a law was passed that allowed obligatory donation unless a refusal was registered in the national computer. That was converted to a a veto from a family in serious distress being allowable.\" The kidney specialist became health secretary, and has instituted a system of transplant co-ordinators based in Spain's hospitals that is the envy of UK doctors. The result, said Professor Sells, is that Spain leads Europe, having increased its organ donation from five per million to 31. Other countries with opt-out donor schemes are close behind - the Czech Republic is second with about 28 per million, then Belgium with 26. In the UK there are 15 per million. But although the BMA voted in favour of an opt-out system at its annual conference last year, its leaders feel public opinion is not ready for the change. It also points out that there are shortages of surgeons to perform the transplants and, critically, of intensive care beds. Unless these problems are overcome, an opt-out scheme would not solve anything.",

The committee was told by MI5 the decision was taken by an unidentified relatively junior officer on the grounds of her age and that her offences had been committed 50 years earlier. The committee described MI5's decision not to refer her case to the attorney general as a \"serious failure\". Astonishingly, it said Dame Stella Rimington, then head of MI5, was never told about the Norwood case. In MI5's words, it had \"slipped out of sight\" between 1993 and 1998. Nor was she told about John Symonds, a KGB contact codenamed Scot who had been given immunity from prosecution relating to a separate investigation into police corruption. So great was the extent to which ministers were kept in the dark that the US president may well have learned about MI6's success in obtaining information about past KGB activities from Mr Mitrokhin before the British prime minister, the committee said. The Norwood case returned to MI5's sights after MI6 drew up a careful plan for the publication of a book by Mr Mitrokhin with the help of Christopher Andrew, a Cambridge professor regarded as a \"safe pair of hands\" who had signed the Official Secrets Act. The committee described a catalogue of mistakes as a \"muddle\", and what it called \"a failing in the system\".

It added: \"Officials failed to provide ministers with the necessary support and advice ...

Mr Rose yesterday insisted he discovered her from information gleaned in the US. However, the committee revealed yesterday that MI6 passed him \"material\" in April last year, five months before the book was published. BBC plans to identify Mrs Norwood in a documentary enabled Mr Mitrokin to reveal her name in his book, leading to what the committee called \"misleading stories\" which sabotaged Whitehall's plans. Despite media claims that Mrs Norwood was one of Moscow's most significant agents in Britain, MI5 told the committee her value as an atom spy was \"at most, marginal\". Mrs Norwood, 87, was secretary of the British Non-ferrous Metals Research Association after the second world war. According to MI5, she provided the KGB with intelligence on cladding material used in British nuclear reactors. The committee said Mr Mitrokhin walked into the British embassy in a Baltic state capital in 1992 after the CIA turned down his offer.

A study for the Blairite thinktank the Institute for Public Policy Research finds that the design of then New deal has led to a significant imbalance of participants. The paper, by Katherine Rake of the London School of Economics, is the latest in a series of evaluations of the \u00a33.5b programme, which is designed to find work and training for a range of groups, including 18- to 24-year-olds, lone parents and the long-term unemployed. It emerged this week that government officials running the programme have privately admitted it has serious failings, including returning too many young people to the dole after finishing a work placement or training. The latest study, to be published in IPPR's journal New Economy, concludes that the new deal fails jobless women. The new deal for young people and the new deal for the long-term unemployed both require participants to have been registered unemployed and claiming job seeker's allowance for six months. However, women, especially those in couples, are much less likely than men to claim the benefit or to claim for the full period required.

The department of social security is singled out for special concern in the latest report of the Commons public accounts committee because it has millions of annual transactions with the country's benefit claimants each year. The report says the department would save \u00a37.7m if just 2% of the 160m telephone calls it receives every year could be shifted into inquiries over a dedicated website. Such a move requires better websites with more informa tion and superior design, says the committee, which chaired by the former Conservative minister, David Davies. In theory, filing taxes on the internet, now in its infancy, could be extended to a host of services including state benefits, passports, driving licences and 24-hour access to official information. But the results are \"hit and miss\", the committee says. Its report also takes ministers to task for not developing compatible computer systems that would allow them and their officials to talk directly to each other via intranet, another money-saver. Few ministers have IT skills themselves. The prime minister - who has recently had IT training - is constantly urging Whitehall departments to raise their information technology game. He recently brought forward the target date for making 50% of governmental transactions accessible electronically - from 2008 to 2005. But the public accounts committee learned to its \"surprise\" that telephone calls via web-based technology are being included as \"electronic\". Mr Davies said last night: \"Government on the web has the potential to revolutionise the relationship between the citizen and the state and ... could transform the quality of public services.\" It also had the potential to save money, he added. The committee did not examine the government's plan, announced in April, to create a vast public service jobs website, advertising up to 4,000 jobs a day - and presenting a huge saving on advertising costs.",

The Scottish National party leader, Alex Salmond, is facing the prospect of being served with a writ for defamation by the man he ousted as his party treasurer. After consulting lawyers yesterday, Ian Blackford is preparing to sue Mr Salmond over comments he allegedly made at a weekend meeting which saw a vote of no confidence against him. But as Mr Blackford conferred with counsel, the SNP took rearguard action in a public round of internecine warfare. Mr Blackford was suspended as party treasurer, pending a meeting of the national executive in July. This, however, is not the only disciplinary woe before Mr Salmond. As the Scottish press awaits the prospect of an embarrassing court case with barely concealed glee, the SNP is also preparing to discipline one of its most high-profile backbenchers for dissent. Margo MacDonald, an ally of Mr Blackford, will tomorrow face allegations that she publicly criticised an SNP group decision in remarks to a newspaper. A two-thirds majority would be required to give Ms MacDonald a final warning and it is unlikely that she will be dealt with so harshly, but her supporters claim it may be the start of a campaign to de-select her. Both Ms MacDonald and Mr Blackford are part of the fundamentalist wing of the SNP, a grouping opposed to Mr Salmond's gradualist approach to independence. This has led to suggestions that the party leadership has begun a purge against dissidents. It is an impression not lost on the SNP hierarchy and the party yesterday moved to counter it by appointing Kenny MacAskill, another leading fundamentalist, as replacement to Mr Blackford. But there is undoubtedly more trouble to come. Mr Blackford commands only limited support among the upper echelons of the SNP, but yesterday he hinted that he is preparing to bypass that grouping and take his fight directly to the party ranks at conference in September. With Mr Blackford also accusing Mr Salmond of political cowardice and control freakery, the portents are for a summer of discontent - which could even result in a leadership challenge in the autumn. The ill-feeling between Mr Salmond and his one-time treasurer is deep-rooted. Mr Blackford was unhappy about the low priority given to independence in the Scottish election campaign and critical of the SNP's vote-losing plan to put a penny on income tax. But the latest round of animosity stems from allegations about the SNP's financial state. The SNP has an overdraft of around \u00a3400,000 and it is sell ing off its Edinburgh headquarters. Last Saturday morning, Mr Blackford says, he received a telephone call from the SNP leader informing him that he was planning to propose a motion of no confidence at a meeting of the party executive. Mr Blackford was unable to attend the meeting and the SNP will not discuss what was said during it. But it is alleged that Mr Salmond decried Mr Blackford as being responsible for the overspend at the Scottish elections. Mr Blackford claims these comments harm his professional reputation as a banker. Whatever was said in the meeting, the motion against Mr Blackford was passed 18-3. The treasurer, however, refused to resign, and the motion meant little more than a calculated insult. It was not until Mr Blackford was suspended for conduct inimical to the party that things really began to hot up. A leadership challenge to Mr Salmond has been predicted since the SNP's less than spectacular performance in the Scottish elections - and the ousting of Mr Blackford might prove to be the catalyst which sparks it at the party's conference in September.",

      "bodyText": "Britain succeeded in blocking a \u00a335m European aid package to Liberia yesterday, an act designed to force its president, Charles Taylor, to stop supplying the rebels in Sierra Leone with arms and funds in return for diamonds. It was strongly opposed by the European Commission, which believes that it will be ordinary Liberians and not Mr Taylor who will feel the pain. Keith Vaz, the British minister for Europe, persuaded a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg to put the aid \"on ice\" after several days of intense lobbying by the Foreign Office in EU capitals. Mr Vaz, who stepped in at the last minute after Robin Cook was called upon to attend President Assad's funeral in Syria, ran into French opposition when he raised the possibility of threatening to suspend EU aid to Liberia altogether. Other EU members did agree to sign a strongly worded statement expressing \"deep concern\" about Liberia's involvement in Sierra Leone and condemning its illicit diamond trade with the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), which is believed to be fuelling the war. EU diplomats in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, will now draw up a report on the extent of Mr Taylor's involvement in Sierra Leone and warn him to behave in \"a responsible and consistent\" manner. EC officials made it clear that they would have preferred Britain not to have used EU aid as a political football. \"The thing is that this money is to help poor people and not the government of Liberia, so there is some regret that there may now be an overdue delay in getting the money to those who need it,\" one said. It is unclear how long the aid package, whose delivery was unanimously approved by EU member states last month, will be kept on ice. French diplomats said that they were happy to go along with Britain up to a point but had balked at the suggestion that the EU should consider opening consultations with Liberia under the Lom\u00e9 convention,which could lead to the suspension of all EU aid. UK diplomats argue, however, that this was not the main issue and claim that the overall decision to delay the aid package sends a clear signal to Mr Taylor that \"it is not business as usual\", and spells out the fact that EU aid is not immune to politics. \"Other member states supported us by their silence and were very supportive once they had seen the dossier we had compiled,\" a British diplomat told the Guardian, referring to a confidential British report detailing Mr Taylor's role in supplying the RUF with arms. A copy of the report, obtained by the Guardian, shows that Mr Taylor has been providing money, arms and advice to the RUF for some time. It is one of the most devastating attacks on a foreign head of state by the British government in recent years. The report claims that Mr Taylor does not want to see the RUF defeated, in spite of his efforts to help secure the release of 500 UN peacekeepers held hostage by the group. Mr Taylor, it suggests, wants to install Sam Bockarie as the new leader of the RUF to replace the captured Foday Sankoh and is allowing rebel forces to train in Liberia. \"President Taylor is motivated by a need to maintain his personal wealth and political position in Liberia. Taylor's game-plan is to maintain his control and influence over eastern Sierra Leone by making it lawless.\" Britain plans to use the report to persuade other international organisations, such as the World Bank and the UN, to make Mr Taylor's life difficult. It clearly identifies diamonds as being at the heart of the conflict.

The prosecutor's office confirmed that Mr Gusinsky was detained last night on suspicion of embezzling state funds, two months after squads of masked paramilitaries raided the headquarters of Media-most, the nerve centre of his business empire, and carried off crates of documents and tapes. The arrest will inevitably bring protests and put Moscow liberals in fear for their decade-old liberties. Mr Putin was out of the country at the time, visiting Spain and Germany. The prosecutor's office has 10 days to bring formal charges against Mr Gusinsky. Russian news agencies said he was suspected of having embezzled $10m (\u00a36.6m) of state funds. Mr Gusinsky values his overall business assets at \u00a31.5bn. During his recent visit to Moscow, President Bill Clinton made a point of implicitly supporting Mr Gusinsky against Kremlin pressure by appearing on his Ekho Moskvy radio station for a phone-in. Mr Gusinsky's television and radio and his main newspaper, Segodnya, have been under strong pressure in recent months to toe the official line on the Chechen war, but have consistently pursued a critical line. Since using his assets to secure Boris Yeltsin's re-election in 1996, Mr Gusinsky has fallen foul of the Kremlin power-brokers and has been engaged in a long and bitter feud with the other key media magnate and Kremlin insider, Boris Berezovsky. Mr Gusinsky, who has an Israeli passport as well as a Russian one, is also head of the Russian branch of the World Jewish Congress, and is currently embroiled in another battle with Mr Berezovsky over the leadership of Russia's Jewish communities. He is one of the few public figures in Russia who supported Nato's campaign against President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia last year. Earlier this month he told a group of foreign reporters in Moscow that he was \"really alarmed\" at political developments in Russia. \"Only totalitarian countries can solve problems that way, by pure force,\" he said, discussing the Chechen war. He last met Mr Putin in October when, he said, he found himself in a \"dialogue of the deaf\". \"I told him you can't secure peace with guns.

      "bodyText": "A mildly radioactive letter sent to the Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, led police to a warehouse full of a material associated with the extraction of uranium yesterday. The discovery of 15 tons of monazite came after an anonymous tip-off that dangerous radioactive material was being smuggled from Japan to North Korea. The claim was made in a letter sent on June 6 to Mr Mori and the heads of eight government bodies, including the police and defence agencies. Each envelope contained three grams of monazite, a mineral phosphate mined and processed to recover uranium. Monazite, which is not controlled by international treaties, also includes thorium, which can be used in nuclear bombs and reactors. The sand-like yellow substance was found to be radioactive, though officials said the level was not harmful. According to the Kyodo news agency, a hand-written note in the envelope warned: \"Uranium is being sent to North Korea and police should investigate because it is dangerous.\" The sender said the smuggling was being carried out by the president of an education ministry foundation, whose name has been withheld. The police found the monazite stockpile during a search of properties owned by the foundation near Tokyo and in central Japan. According to science agency officials, there were no harmful levels of radioactivity at the sites. In interviews with domestic media, the president said he had imported 50 tons of monazite from Thailand about 20 years ago with the intention of selling it on to hot-spring resort operators, who strive to offer unique mixes of minerals in bath waters. The president said he had sold most of his original stock and the remaining 15 tons was securely stored. The police are investigating whether he broke nuclear-related laws by importing or storing the monazite. Attention is also focused on the intentions of the sender of the radioactive letters. One theory is that the warning was designed to raise fear about the North Korean capital Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme before yesterday's historic summit between the leaders of North and South Korea.

The North Korean leader, Chairman Kim Jong-il, took centre stage immediately by personally welcoming the South Korean president, Kim Dae-jung, at the airport before escorting him to a televised meeting in town. \"Don't worry, I will not disappoint you,\" he told Kim Dae-jung. \"The world is now watching and I have to respond during [your] three-day stay here.\" \"June 13 will be recorded in history,\" he told his guest from the South, who replied: \"Let's make history from now on.\" After reviewing a high-stepping guard of honour, they travelled into town from the airport in the same car, chatting for half an hour and - said South Korean officials - sometimes holding hands. Hundreds of thousands of Pyongyang citizens lined the streets from the airport. Most of the women wore traditional Korean dress while the men were dressed in formal suits and ties. Waving red vinyl flowers with choreographed enthusiasm, they cried out \" mansei \" (long life) and \"protect Kim Jong-il to the death!\" South Korean officials claimed that there were also some shouts of \"Kim Dae- jung\". In a land where one man counts for everything, Kim Jong-il's performance transformed the day. Often described as reclusive, he spoke freely to the cameras and was heard and seen at greater length in a few hours yesterday than in all his public appearances in the past 10 years. Relaxed in his army-style khaki trousers and tunic, he smiled, gestured and did not seem to tire - although he is evidently overweight. He showed no signs of the nervous strain (and worse) that had been attributed to him by South Korean propaganda in the past. Kim Jong-il raised a laugh by saying he had heard that Kim Dae-jung started the morning with only half a soft-boiled egg. \"Coming for sightseeing,\" he enquired, \"why did you have so little to eat for breakfast?\" His guest responded with the obvious punch-line: \"Because I knew I would have a good meal when I got to Pyongyang.\" The banter and the bunting does not mean that this is a lightweight encounter. The real punch-line for the outside world is the signal sent by both leaders yesterday that Koreans now intend to act for themselves. Kim Dae-jung spoke of \"taking the initiative on our own\". By congratulating his southern counterpart on his \"courageous visit to the North\", Kim Jong-il implied that the US and other powers, no doubt including Japan, might take exception. A senior western diplomat in Seoul acknowledged last night that there was some truth in this. \"It needed President Clinton to bring about the Middle East summit,\" he commented. \"But the Koreans are proud of having done it by themselves.\" The portrayal of Kim Dae-jung as defying the outside world reflects North Korea's inner rationale for dealing with Seoul after decades spent denouncing it as a lackey of US imperialism. The personal reception at the airport was an unprecedented break with North Korean protocol. The North Koreans as hosts were able to stage-manage the proceedings to their own purposes. Kim Dae-jung was whisked away from the airport without having delivered a prepared speech - though the text had already been distributed in Seoul. The southern leader had hoped to say that he had \"come to Pyongyang to lead the effort for peace, cooperation and unification\". Perhaps the North felt this would be claiming too great a share of the credit for the mission, which Kim Jong-il is supposed to lead single-handedly. The cheering crowds were hardly spontaneous, even though many South Koreans watching on public TV screens in Seoul were moved by the sight. A North Korean guide pointedly told a South Korean journalist: \"It only takes a few hours for all [our] citizens to be mobilised\". He then asked: \"Did such big crowds turn out in Seoul when he [President Kim] departed?\" Although the 27-minute chat before the cameras was instantly billed by South Korean officials as the \"first summit meeting\", some watchers in Seoul remained sceptical whether the occasion will deliver much of substance. \"They [the North Koreans] are giving Kim Dae-jung a ride,\" commented one veteran South Korean journalist. \"It's all going their way.\" But the South Korean president ended the day with a plea for positive steps \"to solve the mountain of tasks pending between North and South\". \"Let us open up the road that has been blocked off for half a century,\" he said in his banquet speech. \"Let us unite and relink the broken railway. Let us open new sea lanes of communication and air routes too.\" The North Korean leader acknowledged that they must deliver something. He said that people were asking \"why President Kim came to North Korea and I accepted. We have to give the answer.\" A partial answer may come tomorrow before Kim Dae-jung returns home along the blocked-off road through the Demilitarised Zone at Panmunjom. Yesterday the road surface of Unification Bridge on the southern side of Panmunjom was being scrubbed clean by more than 100 workers and tank traps and spikes were being repainted. South Korea as much as the North wants everything to look as gleaming as possible for this first summit since the end of the Japanese war. Kim Jong-il is now being presented by the Seoul press in a highly favourable light and the mysterious last-minute delay in the summit, which remained unexplained yesterday, has been forgotten. \"Chairman Kim gave southern visitors a good impression,\" reported the South Korean press pool from Pyongyang. \"He paid due respects to President Kim, who is many years older. His confident behaviour seems to indicate his firm power-base in the North.\" A polite tabular comparison in the Korea Times describes the character of Kim Dae-jung, 75, as \"elaborate and precise\" and that of Kim Jong-il, 58, as \"bold and surprising\".

President Jacques Chirac has told Mr Clinton that religious freedom will no longer be a subject for bilateral presidential talks, in the light of what has been officially described as \"shocking\" White House support for Scientologists and Moonies. The French government has also complained that Congress's introduction of laws protecting religious freedom internationally is \"an unacceptable intrusion into internal affairs\". The chairman of a French ministerial mission to combat the influence of cults, Alain Vivien, said many observers believed that Mr Clinton was making his peace with big religious movements \"because they offer an indispensable source of political financing\". The French senate has approved legislation reinforcing the right of victims to take action against marginal religious groups.The national assembly plans to toughen the measure even further when it debates it on June 22. MPs on both the left and the right are expected to vote in favour of authorising the courts to forcibly dissolve sects after two complaints, and to forbid them operating in the neighbourhood of schools, hospitals and rest homes. They intend to make such movements responsible for acts considered to be a provocation to suicide or incitement to abandon families. France's war against mainly American-sponsored movements, including the Jehovah's Witnesses, has been running for at least 20 years. It has prompted the accusation, particularly by Scientologists, that it is indulging in \"collective hysteria\" and preparing to ban religious freedoms.

Hailed by the director of the Panama Canal museum, Angeles Ramos, as \"a very important example of French-era technology\", the relic has attracted inquiries from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and conservation tips from engineers in Australia. \"Right now it's just standing in the yard while we wait for suggestions,\" the industrial division manager, Collins Corrigan, said. \"We don't know whether to preserve it as it is or try and restore some of the wagons to their original condition.\" The train was used for several years by the receivers called in to run the French Compagnie Universelle du Canal Interoc\u00e9anique after the French bid to build a canal across Panama collapsed in 1889. It was buried 14 metres (45ft) beneath the surface of Lake Gatun when triumphant US engineers flooded the waterway in 1914. Conscious that its recent exposure to the damp tropical air could hasten their corrosion, diligent yard engineers have unbolted the cast-iron nameplates from the rolling stock and put them in two trays of canal water in the yard's safe. The scarcely legible words identifying the train's manufacturer, the Societe Anonyme Franco Belge, and the date Paris, 1885, bring into sharp focus the epic French quest to push a canal across Panama, described by a historian as \"a sweeping human drama not unlike that of war\". The French diplomat and builder of the Suez Canal, Ferdinand de Lesseps, promised millions of investors that he could force a sea-level canal through the rugged, jungle-covered isthmus to link Atlantic and Pacific trade routes. Raising more than 1bn francs with a series of bond and stock issues during the 1880s, De Lesseps threw France's industrial might at the endeavour. Beginning with a shipment of 50 steam engines and 80 miles of track in 1882, a \"mechanical Noah's Ark\" comprising every imaginable kind of high Victorian steam plant was unpacked from crates at Colon. The army of locomotives, aided by heavy steam shovels, hauled earth from the steep-sided cut until landslides and yellow fever brought the Compagnie Universelle to financial collapse at the end of the decade, almost 20 years after the project was initiated. The failed bid left 22,000 dead, many of them buried in the still neatly tended French cemetery in the canal-side village of Paraiso - Paradise - and a legacy of French Hotel-de-Ville architecture that still reigns over Panama City's old quarter. Standing more than a century later on a crust of rust and freshwater clamshells on the engine's footplate, Domiciano Broce, a PCA engineer, paid tribute to his long-dead colleagues' efforts. Pointing to the gravity-tilt action of the hopper carts and the elegant leafsprings of their rusted suspension, he beamed with appreciative empathy. \"It's a machine as simple as a crowbar,\" he said. \"All the basic principles of mechanical engineering are reflected here.\" But rich as the find may be, it is only the tip of the iceberg. During a drought caused by El Nino in 1998, a small cross on the top of a church spire inched its way clear of the surface of Lake Gatun, showing the location of one of the 12 French workers' towns scattered along the drowned Chagres river valley.

Laurent Kasper-Ansermet, a Swiss investigating magistrate, told the Guardian that he could not elaborate on the Bank of New York-IMF link because his inquiry was at a critical stage and he needed evidence from the US and Russia. But he confirmed a report of \"well-founded suspicions\" after tracing $5bn (\u00a33.3bn) from Russia which was then split up through banks in Switzerland. It is a large amount for a transaction - even by the usual standards of Swiss money laundering. It is said to include $1.4bn which was subsequently transferred to the Bank of New York. But Mr Kasper-Ansermet has only frozen accounts worth $18m in at least 10 Swiss-based banks since he began the inquiry last September. He has not received any response to a formal request for legal assistance lodged with the New York district attorney's office dealing with the Bank of New York case in February and reminders since then have also gone unanswered. That documentary evidence is regarded as crucial to any criminal prosecution for money laundering. By late summer Mr Kasper-Ansermet must also justify maintaining the freeze on Swiss-based assets. A former Bank of New York executive, Lucy Edwards, and her husband, Peter Berlin, pleaded guilty in a US court last February to being involved in a $7bn international money laundering scheme, allegedly detailing how Russian banks used the US bank mainly for tax evasion. Investigators from the national crime squad have questioned the couple - who lived in Britain - in connection with accounts they set up at two British banks. Allegations that IMF aid was siphoned off first surfaced with the affair last year but were denied by Russia. The former US treasury secretary, Robert Rubin, told Congress that much of a $4.8bn loan in 1999 may have been misused, leading the G7 group of industrialised nations to put pressure on Moscow to co-operate with cross-border money laundering investigations. Last month the Swiss magistrate asked the Russian deputy state prosecutor to question officials at Russia's central bank. The trail is said to extend to three Russian commercial banks - DKB, Flamingo and Sobibank, as well as Sinex, an offshore bank in the Pacific island of Nauru. Despite regular meetings, Swiss judges fear their Russian counterparts are unable to go very far because of the political ramifications. Mr Kasper-Ansermet said he was tracing transactions of Benex International, Becs International LLC and Lowland Inc, three companies cited in the US case against the Bank of New York executives. Several people in a separate case, which involved a Swiss construction company and corruption in the Kremlin, are due to be formally charged in Geneva later this month with money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation. The affair has been linked to credit cards which were given to former President Yeltsin's daughters.",

Three months ago its management predicted the company would break even. </p> <p>Analysts are used to nasty surprises from this group. Over the past two years Oxford has issued four profit warnings including one in March. </p> <p>Yesterday morning the stock was marked down 11p at 159p, close to its all time low, but it recovered to end the session at 166p, down 4p. </p> <p>The company blamed a big order backlog in its superconductivity business for the latest disappointment. A year earlier it posted a pre-tax and pre-exceptionals profit of \u00a312.7m. </p> <p>The City was not impressed by the latest figures, even though many analysts had predicted the results would be considerably worse than the company expected. </p> <p>Oxford, which makes medical instruments and research products, said it had new risk management procedures in place for its superconductivity business. </p> <p>The company held its yearly dividend at 8.4p and chief executive Andrew MacIntosh explained that two out of three of Oxford's business streams had returned to profitability in the second half of the financial year. </p> <p>\"While I am disappointed with this year's outcome, we are making real progress with the TopFlight reorganisation programme which is on track to deliver the forecast improvements in performance.\" </p> <p>An exceptional charge of \u00a37.3m had been taken last year and a further \u00a31.6m would be taken in the coming year. This would cover ongoing restructuring which is expected to produce savings of \u00a34m during 2000-2001. </p> <p>Around 10% of the workforce has been cut following a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers which also urged it to reduce its six business streams to three. </p> <p>The company has been gradually quitting its higher-cost Oxfordshire bases. Next week it will transfer its medical business from Abingdon to Woking while the analytical division will switch from Abingdon to High Wycombe. </p> <p>But the legacy of profit warnings might take longer to depart.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shares in Oxford Instruments plunged in early trading yesterday after it reported an \u00a3800,000 annual loss. Three months ago its management predicted the company would break even. Analysts are used to nasty surprises from this group. Over the past two years Oxford has issued four profit warnings including one in March. Yesterday morning the stock was marked down 11p at 159p, close to its all time low, but it recovered to end the session at 166p, down 4p. The company blamed a big order backlog in its superconductivity business for the latest disappointment. A year earlier it posted a pre-tax and pre-exceptionals profit of \u00a312.7m. The City was not impressed by the latest figures, even though many analysts had predicted the results would be considerably worse than the company expected. Oxford, which makes medical instruments and research products, said it had new risk management procedures in place for its superconductivity business. The company held its yearly dividend at 8.4p and chief executive Andrew MacIntosh explained that two out of three of Oxford's business streams had returned to profitability in the second half of the financial year. \"While I am disappointed with this year's outcome, we are making real progress with the TopFlight reorganisation programme which is on track to deliver the forecast improvements in performance.\" An exceptional charge of \u00a37.3m had been taken last year and a further \u00a31.6m would be taken in the coming year. This would cover ongoing restructuring which is expected to produce savings of \u00a34m during 2000-2001. Around 10% of the workforce has been cut following a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers which also urged it to reduce its six business streams to three. The company has been gradually quitting its higher-cost Oxfordshire bases. Next week it will transfer its medical business from Abingdon to Woking while the analytical division will switch from Abingdon to High Wycombe. But the legacy of profit warnings might take longer to depart.",

      "byline": "Jonathan Freedland",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Like every new parent, Tony Blair is getting more advice than he needs. There's the mother-in-law on the right, urging him to tilt the baby her way. There are the grandparents on the left, wishing Tony would do things the way they used to. And all around there are the candid friends, shaking their heads, tutting that young Mr Blair has not lived up to the enormous hopes they all had for him.</p> <p>The prime minister says he takes no notice these days of the newspaper claims that he's experienced \"the worst week of his premiership\". They have said it too many times before. But as he wakes, twice a night apparently, to rock baby Leo to sleep, his mind must race with the torrent of criticism (and worse) that has been pouring his way - especially these last seven days.</p> <p>He's had bad notices since the very start of the year, when the fiasco of the dome's opening night was followed by the NHS crisis, the civil war over Ken Livingstone in London, bad local election results and a run of media successes for William Hague on asylum and crime. But the culmination came exactly a week ago, with that now infamous mauling at the hands of the Women's Institute. Their slow handclap and mini-walkout has been variously described (in ascending order of hyperbole) as Blair's Sheffield rally, his Black Wednesday and even (a classic, this) his \"Ceausescu moment\". Just as Neil Kinnock was finished when he punched the air in Sheffield, just as John Major was doomed once Britain was ejected from the ERM, and just as Romania's communist dictator faced the abyss when the Bucharest masses began to boo - so Tony Blair saw his undoing in the scowling faces of the WI.</p> <p>It was that moment of visible weakness in the once all-conquering Labour leader, that slipping of the halo, which triggered the latest deluge of unwanted advice. On the left, a brigade of trade unions is bombarding next month's National Policy Forum with hostile resolutions while Ken Livingstone - clearly straining after a month of self-discipline - has returned to newspaper punditry to tell the PM to be more like him. Ken and the unions urge Blair to stop trying to appeal to everyone and to forge instead a centre-left coalition with unabashedly progressive views. They want Labour to write off the right; to make instead the left case for spending, activist government and, yes, even for higher taxes.</p> <p>Meanwhile the right whispers an opposite message. They say the problem is not with disenchanted Labour activists. Rather what matters is the aspirational, Sierra-driving, Basildon man who deserted Labour for four elections on the trot - but who came back in 1997. These are the people Blair must keep, and who have been turned off by the government's perceived softness on asylum, crime and Europe. The prime mover of this view is focus group king Philip Gould who, thanks to a handy leak, has been revealed as the sage who warned the PM his WI speech would turn to ashes. (Blair, incidentally, claims never to have seen that Gould memo.)</p> <p>So the hapless Tony is left standing in the middle, pushed and pulled in opposite directions, clutching the baby that is the Labour government. Which way will he jump? Where are his instincts, to tack left where Ken and the unions want him - or further right as Gould and most of the press demands?</p> <p>The answer is that Blair will stay just where he is: neither left, nor right but straight down the middle. He has never wavered from the strategic calculation he made years ago: that elections are won on the centre ground and whoever owns that territory owns power. That's why he's not too bothered by Hague's recent run. The Tory leader may be mobilising his own core vote but, Blair believes, Hague's prescriptions are too rightwing for the rest of the country. The golden path runs through the middle - and that's where Blair plans to stay.</p> <p>But, and this may be hard for Blair's detractors on both left and right to swallow, it's not just calculation. The Labour leader actually believes what so many dismiss as third way guff and blather. It is not pure electoral positioning, which could be junked overnight. The prime minister genuinely believes his actions are rooted in a political philosophy - and that we are the dim ones for not seeing it.</p> <p>T he core idea is that for the entire post-war era politics was organised in a simple, binary fashion. Ranged on the left were the advocates of a good society. On the right, the champions of a strong economy. What neither realised is that a country needs both - and that you cannot have one without the other. That may sound like a cop-out and a fudge. But for Blair, that's the only place a smart government can be.</p> <p>The result is that Tony Blair can seem oddly lonely. Privately, he says he feels like a man ahead of his time: everyone around him is stuck in an 80s timewarp, still seeing the world on left/right lines. By 2030 everyone will see the world his way, wondering how it could have taken us all so long to cotton on. To him it is so obvious. Not the plea for opportunity voiced by the left, nor the demand for responsibility lodged by the right - but a \"synthesis\" of both. It's still about principles, says Blair: it's just that his principles include two which have been pitted against each other, mistakenly, for nearly a century.</p> <p>The trouble is a shortage of political glue. For some reason that third way idea refuses to stick to any part of the national cortex. So does the long list of Labour achievements, which Blair can rattle off in his sleep - and which set the provisional wing of the WI heckling last week. Why does that refuse to gel?</p> <p>The Blairite answer is simple: \"absence of struggle\". In the Tory years, every new proposal saw the Conservatives line up their troops on the battlefield, Labour would then follow them - and lose. The contest would convince the nation that something had changed. So Margaret Thatcher's trade union reforms were valued because the miners' strike proved they had been hard won. Blair's own achievements - the minimum wage or the new deal - have come without struggle. And so they are valued less.</p> <p>There's a connection here with Blair himself. The PM seems aware that the British people have not taken him to heart; that they respect rather than like him. Apparently he wonders if that's because things seem to have come to him too easily: the gilded career through public school, Oxbridge and the law; the squeaky clean family; even the new baby. Blair's progress looks so smooth; no one, say his friends, sees \"the little legs paddling away under the surface\".</p> <p>The government is the same: we haven't seen the struggle. Picking random fights on the right or left won't quite be enough. For Blairism requires an almost unique piece of political story-telling: to take an inclusive, centrist synthesis of left and right, old and new - and depict it as a passionate struggle, in which voters have to take sides. We have seen the smooth sailing: now we want to see those legs, paddling furiously.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\">jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com </a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Like every new parent, Tony Blair is getting more advice than he needs. There's the mother-in-law on the right, urging him to tilt the baby her way. There are the grandparents on the left, wishing Tony would do things the way they used to. And all around there are the candid friends, shaking their heads, tutting that young Mr Blair has not lived up to the enormous hopes they all had for him. The prime minister says he takes no notice these days of the newspaper claims that he's experienced \"the worst week of his premiership\". They have said it too many times before. But as he wakes, twice a night apparently, to rock baby Leo to sleep, his mind must race with the torrent of criticism (and worse) that has been pouring his way - especially these last seven days. He's had bad notices since the very start of the year, when the fiasco of the dome's opening night was followed by the NHS crisis, the civil war over Ken Livingstone in London, bad local election results and a run of media successes for William Hague on asylum and crime. But the culmination came exactly a week ago, with that now infamous mauling at the hands of the Women's Institute. Their slow handclap and mini-walkout has been variously described (in ascending order of hyperbole) as Blair's Sheffield rally, his Black Wednesday and even (a classic, this) his \"Ceausescu moment\". Just as Neil Kinnock was finished when he punched the air in Sheffield, just as John Major was doomed once Britain was ejected from the ERM, and just as Romania's communist dictator faced the abyss when the Bucharest masses began to boo - so Tony Blair saw his undoing in the scowling faces of the WI. It was that moment of visible weakness in the once all-conquering Labour leader, that slipping of the halo, which triggered the latest deluge of unwanted advice. On the left, a brigade of trade unions is bombarding next month's National Policy Forum with hostile resolutions while Ken Livingstone - clearly straining after a month of self-discipline - has returned to newspaper punditry to tell the PM to be more like him. Ken and the unions urge Blair to stop trying to appeal to everyone and to forge instead a centre-left coalition with unabashedly progressive views. They want Labour to write off the right; to make instead the left case for spending, activist government and, yes, even for higher taxes. Meanwhile the right whispers an opposite message. They say the problem is not with disenchanted Labour activists. Rather what matters is the aspirational, Sierra-driving, Basildon man who deserted Labour for four elections on the trot - but who came back in 1997. These are the people Blair must keep, and who have been turned off by the government's perceived softness on asylum, crime and Europe. The prime mover of this view is focus group king Philip Gould who, thanks to a handy leak, has been revealed as the sage who warned the PM his WI speech would turn to ashes. (Blair, incidentally, claims never to have seen that Gould memo.) So the hapless Tony is left standing in the middle, pushed and pulled in opposite directions, clutching the baby that is the Labour government. Which way will he jump? Where are his instincts, to tack left where Ken and the unions want him - or further right as Gould and most of the press demands? The answer is that Blair will stay just where he is: neither left, nor right but straight down the middle. He has never wavered from the strategic calculation he made years ago: that elections are won on the centre ground and whoever owns that territory owns power. That's why he's not too bothered by Hague's recent run. The Tory leader may be mobilising his own core vote but, Blair believes, Hague's prescriptions are too rightwing for the rest of the country. The golden path runs through the middle - and that's where Blair plans to stay. But, and this may be hard for Blair's detractors on both left and right to swallow, it's not just calculation. The Labour leader actually believes what so many dismiss as third way guff and blather. It is not pure electoral positioning, which could be junked overnight. The prime minister genuinely believes his actions are rooted in a political philosophy - and that we are the dim ones for not seeing it. T he core idea is that for the entire post-war era politics was organised in a simple, binary fashion. Ranged on the left were the advocates of a good society. On the right, the champions of a strong economy. What neither realised is that a country needs both - and that you cannot have one without the other. That may sound like a cop-out and a fudge. But for Blair, that's the only place a smart government can be. The result is that Tony Blair can seem oddly lonely. Privately, he says he feels like a man ahead of his time: everyone around him is stuck in an 80s timewarp, still seeing the world on left/right lines. By 2030 everyone will see the world his way, wondering how it could have taken us all so long to cotton on. To him it is so obvious. Not the plea for opportunity voiced by the left, nor the demand for responsibility lodged by the right - but a \"synthesis\" of both. It's still about principles, says Blair: it's just that his principles include two which have been pitted against each other, mistakenly, for nearly a century. The trouble is a shortage of political glue. For some reason that third way idea refuses to stick to any part of the national cortex. So does the long list of Labour achievements, which Blair can rattle off in his sleep - and which set the provisional wing of the WI heckling last week. Why does that refuse to gel? The Blairite answer is simple: \"absence of struggle\". In the Tory years, every new proposal saw the Conservatives line up their troops on the battlefield, Labour would then follow them - and lose. The contest would convince the nation that something had changed. So Margaret Thatcher's trade union reforms were valued because the miners' strike proved they had been hard won. Blair's own achievements - the minimum wage or the new deal - have come without struggle. And so they are valued less. There's a connection here with Blair himself. The PM seems aware that the British people have not taken him to heart; that they respect rather than like him. Apparently he wonders if that's because things seem to have come to him too easily: the gilded career through public school, Oxbridge and the law; the squeaky clean family; even the new baby. Blair's progress looks so smooth; no one, say his friends, sees \"the little legs paddling away under the surface\". The government is the same: we haven't seen the struggle. Picking random fights on the right or left won't quite be enough. For Blairism requires an almost unique piece of political story-telling: to take an inclusive, centrist synthesis of left and right, old and new - and depict it as a passionate struggle, in which voters have to take sides. We have seen the smooth sailing: now we want to see those legs, paddling furiously. jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com",

But English law depends on 12 average people sitting in the jury box - of different backgrounds. Juries are supposed to represent a true cross-section, but in my experience, they didn't. A straw poll of 12 average people might well contain a bit of everything, but not if the vast majority of the educated middle class wriggles out.</p> <p>One of the juries I sat on contained someone who could not read the oath. After three attempts she was gently told by the judge to repeat the words after the court official. Maybe she had a great understanding of human nature. But if I was the defendant, or a witness, I would be a lot more confident if I knew the trial was being heard by a jury that was literate. Particularly as the tricky word in question was \"verdict\".</p> <p>One suggestion of why jury service is so unfashionable is that people apparently don't want to shoulder the responsibility of sending people down. In my experience what one might call the \"woolly liberal\" constituency was largely absent. In one case most of my counterparts appeared to have been born and bred in Texas. \"Prison's too good for him,\" she opined in the lounge after our case had finished. \"He should be executed by lethal injection. Or castrated.\" There then followed the hoary old chit-chat about taxpayers' money being wasted, the astonishing luxury of prisons and so on. After which outburst, she got back to her 5,000-piece jigsaw puzzle of the Queen Mother.</p> <p>Of course, a jury made up of official quotas would be impossible to pull off. But as the accused can be anyone in society, so should the juries who sit in judgment. The Auld report has suggested that as in America, jury service should be virtually compulsory, with penalties for those who cry off. I suggest the problem doesn't lie so much with the courts as with office politics. It is now so unfashionable to take any time off work, that the idea of doing jury service for a fortnight is, in many people's lives, simply impossible.</p> <p>Forget the fusty concept of public duty, of citizenship. Like those other public services, transport and education, the fire behind this particular rocket went out with the Ark. The only citizenship that is important now is the one you owe to your company. Most people are so hell-bent on performing 60-hour office marathons every week that leaving their desks for anything other than the death of a relation (close) or the birth of a child (yours), is unthinkable. But why?</p> <p>Paradoxically, while 21st century business practices now dictate the desk should be more familiar than the home, bosses are also very fond of reminding people they are not indispensable. Fine. So drop the get-out clauses. For those of us who are not operating on sick people, or not actually running the country, two weeks of immersion in our legal system might be a good thing.</p> <p>The responsibility of being a juror is not only important, and dutiful, in a strangely attractive, outmoded way; but it also allows a fascinating insight into how other people live. And I'm not talking about the defendant.

But English law depends on 12 average people sitting in the jury box - of different backgrounds. Juries are supposed to represent a true cross-section, but in my experience, they didn't. A straw poll of 12 average people might well contain a bit of everything, but not if the vast majority of the educated middle class wriggles out. One of the juries I sat on contained someone who could not read the oath. After three attempts she was gently told by the judge to repeat the words after the court official. Maybe she had a great understanding of human nature. But if I was the defendant, or a witness, I would be a lot more confident if I knew the trial was being heard by a jury that was literate. Particularly as the tricky word in question was \"verdict\". One suggestion of why jury service is so unfashionable is that people apparently don't want to shoulder the responsibility of sending people down. In my experience what one might call the \"woolly liberal\" constituency was largely absent. In one case most of my counterparts appeared to have been born and bred in Texas. \"Prison's too good for him,\" she opined in the lounge after our case had finished. \"He should be executed by lethal injection. Or castrated.\" There then followed the hoary old chit-chat about taxpayers' money being wasted, the astonishing luxury of prisons and so on. After which outburst, she got back to her 5,000-piece jigsaw puzzle of the Queen Mother. Of course, a jury made up of official quotas would be impossible to pull off. But as the accused can be anyone in society, so should the juries who sit in judgment. The Auld report has suggested that as in America, jury service should be virtually compulsory, with penalties for those who cry off. I suggest the problem doesn't lie so much with the courts as with office politics. It is now so unfashionable to take any time off work, that the idea of doing jury service for a fortnight is, in many people's lives, simply impossible. Forget the fusty concept of public duty, of citizenship. Like those other public services, transport and education, the fire behind this particular rocket went out with the Ark. The only citizenship that is important now is the one you owe to your company. Most people are so hell-bent on performing 60-hour office marathons every week that leaving their desks for anything other than the death of a relation (close) or the birth of a child (yours), is unthinkable. But why? Paradoxically, while 21st century business practices now dictate the desk should be more familiar than the home, bosses are also very fond of reminding people they are not indispensable. Fine. So drop the get-out clauses. For those of us who are not operating on sick people, or not actually running the country, two weeks of immersion in our legal system might be a good thing. The responsibility of being a juror is not only important, and dutiful, in a strangely attractive, outmoded way; but it also allows a fascinating insight into how other people live. And I'm not talking about the defendant. Can you seriously imagine going to work every day in a black suit, wearing a wig and gown and peppering every other phrase with \"Your Honour\"? \u0095 Rosie Millard is arts correspondent of the BBC. comment@theguardian.com",

Rather than sit back and enjoy the latest Hollywood offering, they set about an earnest symposium, the topic of which may be best summed up as the cost of free lunches. </p> <p>Despite Milton Friedman's best efforts, policymakers never tire of searching for that elusive midday meal with no bill to follow. And among the favourite luncheon vouchers is insolvency law reform, a field of activity that - by being labelled an attack on a \"cultural\" rather than an economic problem - is assumed to be cost free. </p> <p>By removing the \"stigma\" of corporate and individual bankruptcy, the powers that be will unleash the sort of entrepreneurial dynamism that has made the United States economy the greatest on earth. Or that's the theory. </p> <p>The symposium, arranged by the insolvency practitioners' professional body, known as R3, was convened to discuss proposed changes to the regime governing individual bankruptcy. A consultation paper on this topic is doing the rounds of interested parties and will be back with the Department of Trade by June 30. </p> <p>That this latter document is entitled Bankruptcy - A Fresh Start gives a good idea of the thinking behind it and indeed behind the current wave of reform in general. In our moralistic age, insolvency law reform remains the last great bastion of the permissive society, still blasting salvos in the direction of \"outdated Victorian morality\" which says that bankrupts must be cast down. </p> <p>R3 and allied professionals, however, have their doubts, to put it mildly.

      "bodyText": "This week, a group of financial and legal professionals huddled into a cinema in the Barbican centre in London. Rather than sit back and enjoy the latest Hollywood offering, they set about an earnest symposium, the topic of which may be best summed up as the cost of free lunches. Despite Milton Friedman's best efforts, policymakers never tire of searching for that elusive midday meal with no bill to follow. And among the favourite luncheon vouchers is insolvency law reform, a field of activity that - by being labelled an attack on a \"cultural\" rather than an economic problem - is assumed to be cost free. By removing the \"stigma\" of corporate and individual bankruptcy, the powers that be will unleash the sort of entrepreneurial dynamism that has made the United States economy the greatest on earth. Or that's the theory. The symposium, arranged by the insolvency practitioners' professional body, known as R3, was convened to discuss proposed changes to the regime governing individual bankruptcy. A consultation paper on this topic is doing the rounds of interested parties and will be back with the Department of Trade by June 30. That this latter document is entitled Bankruptcy - A Fresh Start gives a good idea of the thinking behind it and indeed behind the current wave of reform in general. In our moralistic age, insolvency law reform remains the last great bastion of the permissive society, still blasting salvos in the direction of \"outdated Victorian morality\" which says that bankrupts must be cast down. R3 and allied professionals, however, have their doubts, to put it mildly. Should those doubts prove justified, everyone will end up paying, because the cost of credit to all borrowers - good, bad or indifferent - will rise. The story so far. Peter Mandelson, during his time at the DTI, set the ball rolling in November 1998, when he told the Confederation of British Industry: \"In the US some of the most successful entrepreneurs are those who have failed once or twice.

But previous backsliding might be forgiven if, or how, the government could offer some story about its motives in giving this issue such salience at this stage in its life. Where does hunting fit into the rubric of Blairism? Opposition to hunting could, conceivably, be seen as an aspect of much-needed rural modernisation and diversification. The farmers of England and Wales, struggling to recover their reputation, have just launched a new branding scheme, emphasising the quality and safety of the food they produce. Simultaneously to come across as gory brush-brandishers does not quite fit. The government might seek to marry abolition with a package of better services for people who live in rural areas, more diverse employment and, yes, more and better housing. The rejection of John Prescott's housing scheme by the Tories of the south-east has nothing to do with \"countryside\" and a lot to do with amenity values in the suburbs and affluent towns.</p> <p>But so far fox-hunting has not been made to fit. It looks like an expedient, another gesture by a government blown hither and yon by the winds of opinion and the compass bearings of election tacticians. Making precious time for a principled measure central to the Blairite \"project\" is one thing; careening across the political seas on a whim or for fear of backbench rumblings is something disreputably else.</p>",

But previous backsliding might be forgiven if, or how, the government could offer some story about its motives in giving this issue such salience at this stage in its life. Where does hunting fit into the rubric of Blairism? Opposition to hunting could, conceivably, be seen as an aspect of much-needed rural modernisation and diversification. The farmers of England and Wales, struggling to recover their reputation, have just launched a new branding scheme, emphasising the quality and safety of the food they produce. Simultaneously to come across as gory brush-brandishers does not quite fit. The government might seek to marry abolition with a package of better services for people who live in rural areas, more diverse employment and, yes, more and better housing. The rejection of John Prescott's housing scheme by the Tories of the south-east has nothing to do with \"countryside\" and a lot to do with amenity values in the suburbs and affluent towns. But so far fox-hunting has not been made to fit. It looks like an expedient, another gesture by a government blown hither and yon by the winds of opinion and the compass bearings of election tacticians. Making precious time for a principled measure central to the Blairite \"project\" is one thing; careening across the political seas on a whim or for fear of backbench rumblings is something disreputably else.",

After that we're on our own. Asylum's subject, conceivably, is \"the grand curvature of everything\", to choose a formula at random from co-director Iain Sinclair. That sounds like a phrase you might use at a pitching meeting with Channel 4, just before being politely shown the door.

I'm a very, very, very worried person.\" </p> <p>A first meeting with Atzmon suggests something quite different. He is rugged, striking, opinionated, and increasingly revered for the intensity and passion of his saxophone and clarinet playing. In his sunny house in Kilburn, north London, with its bulging boxes of CDs (which testify to an old enthusiasm for DIY distribution), scattered musical instruments, sheet music, children's toys and all the paraphernalia of a freewheeling, positive life, it looks as if Atzmon's worries could be worse. </p> <p>His work as a pop producer - which has helped bring him something like prosperity as jazz players go - has not been his only alternative to playing. An academic career beckoned, but he was distracted from an M Phil in aesthetics by the hyperactive pleasures of delivering firebreathing bop sax to the audiences at the Red Lion in Kilburn High Road. He also briefly attended film school in Israel in his 20s, when he was driven by the desire to make a film about his early experiences in the Israeli army. </p> <p>As well as learning to play swing in a military band, as a soldier he developed a fervent anti-Zionism. Tomorrow his Orient House Ensemble, a world music band of jazzy intensity mixed with klezmer, east European folk forms and at times an almost ambient stillness, plays at the London International Jewish Music Festival with Palestinian oud virtuoso Adel Salameh as a guest. The following evening he's in the Blockheads for the Ian Dury memorial gig in Brixton. Atzmon toured with the Blockheads during Dury's last months, and calls it the nearest thing to a musical family he's ever been in. </p> <p>But though Atzmon has built a reputation and a following in the five years since he came to the UK, he is a career worrier, living a life that ricochets between contradictions. He is loyal to old playing partners (to a point that has hampered his development, some have suggested) and says he needs \"to feel comfortable\", yet dislikes the cosy insularity of the jazz scene. He wants artists to resist fashions and the materialism of a commodity culture, but distrusts public arts funding. His music has a force and conviction that have made it a blast of fresh air in the UK, yet the urge to improve obsesses him. </p> <p>\"Though I've made a lot of friends here, there are things that make it hard for artists. For one, everything has to be put into boxes - hip hop, bebop, world music, pop. It's very conservative, very restrictive, and it's not the way most musicians think. </p> <p>\"For another, it's very difficult to get hard criticism. I'm an ex-soldier and I think like a soldier. I'm against what the Israeli army has stood for big-time, but I think the fact that I was in the army turned me into a clever man. You understand once you're in the army that the world is stupid. But there is a good side to it - you're under severe criticism all the time. Tough. It has made me want my music to be strong and enthusiastic. I want my musicians to look down on me when I don't perform well.\" </p> <p>But the Israeli army's purposes in Palestine eventually filled Atzmon with the desire to escape. \"I got to a point where I was ready to shoot my leg. But I'd had a serious injury before I joined, and it turned out to be a disability I could use to lower my profile and get into the band instead. It was a kind of swing band, and it was my music school. </p> <p>\"In the band we all felt the same - we wanted to fuck the army. It was often very depressing and often very funny. Our conductor died in a car accident, so they put the bus driver in to run the band. He had a mental breakdown trying to do it, so they got this poor woman who was a kind of sex slave for some of the senior officers to be our commander because they had to keep her in the army to keep her from talking. We'd go to a gig, 15 of us, and people would jump out of the bus on the way, so by the time we got there there would be only two people left.\" </p> <p>Atzmon called his new quartet Orient House after the beleaguered Palestinian headquarters in Jerusalem. The name indicates a shift away from the mainstream bebop he has principally played in London, toward the multi-cultural music he had lacked the confidence to showcase. The band's drummer, Asaf Sirkis, shares Atzmon's background, \"which got me back into playing Jewish and Arabic and Balkan music, and I decided I wanted to try this mixture again. Then when the two British members (pianist Frank Harrison and bassist Oli Hayhurst) joined and seemed to hear what we were doing so easily, it just took off. I was amazed. </p> <p>\"My only instruction to Frank Harrison, apart from 'Play whatever you feel like', was 'When I play, don't play if you don't have to'. Jazz is a music - and I'm one of the people who can be blamed for this - that's very intense. Too many notes. And music can be very soulful by being very empty. What we play now is often empty but it still talks. It's sometimes important to listen rather than play.\" </p> <p>Atzmon certainly listened closely to Ian Dury during the singer's last months with the Blockheads. Though the energy of the band is still there, Atzmon knows it won't be the same without Dury. \"Because I'd been a paramedic in the army, he used to show me how they were treating him. He'd talk about it a lot, but he didn't complain. And though he was getting much weaker when he was working two weeks or so before he died, he would still go for it. He was still that giant figure when he was on stage. </p> <p>\"That's the way he struck me - somebody who wasn't a great singer who was a great singer, you know what I mean? Big voice, big presence, big influence. Like Louis Armstrong. That's the way I thought of him. Those people make music come alive. And that's what I do this for.\" </p> <p>The Orient House Ensemble plays the Union Chapel, London N1 (020-7960 4242), tomorrow.

      "body": "<p>At the start of the 21st century, theatre is at last beginning to face up to new technology. The past month alone has produced Blast Theory's Desert Storm, a performance/installation piece on the Gulf war in which audience members are active participants inside a computer game; Fuzzy Logic, a play written entirely on the web; the multimedia spectacle of Laurie Anderson's Moby Dick, and Ulysses's journey re-created via images, light and the interactive movements of a robot and a performer in Marcel Li Antunez Roca's digital performance Afasia. </p> <p>Later this month multimedia moves into the mainstream with the arrival at the National Theatre of Jude Kelly's exuberant version of the MGM classic Singing in the Rain. This light-hearted, all-singing, all-dancing story about the birth of a technology that was to revolutionise movie-making in the 20s (the ability to put sound on film) has been enhanced with modern multimedia technology that embraces graphics, animation and film. Kelly has created a many-layered performance in which the screen and live action comment upon each other, often to comic effect. The result is an evening that snakes backwards and forwards on itself; the 50s musical about the birth of the talkies in 20s Hollywood also appears very sharp, ironic and modern. </p> <p>Apart from its swagger and expertise, there is nothing particularly new about the way that Singing in the Rain uses multi-media. Experimental theatre group Forkbeard Fantasy has spent 20 years melding film and live action in which actors interact not just with each other but also with projected images on a screen. Station House Opera's disturbing Roadmetal Sweetbread presents two lovers whose Miss Julie style power relationship is given a vicious new twist by the constant presence of their on-screen alter-egos. </p> <p>What marks out Singing in the Rain, Forkbeard Fantasy and Station House Opera's work is that they never subjugate the live component to the filmed. The exhilaration is in the head-on smash between one form and another, which creates not a hybrid but something entirely new. </p> <p>What is interesting is that Singing in the Rain emerged not from the more experimental fringes of theatre, but from West Yorkshire Playhouse, a regional theatre often perceived as a bastion of conservatism. Perhaps we should also take heart from the fact that 50 miles away in staid Scarborough you can catch Alan Acykbourn's new comedy Virtual Reality, which takes a jaundiced, but not Luddite, look at our hi-tech world where everyone is plugged in but nobody communicates any more. </p> <p>It was the much-vaunted scene of cyber-sex in Patrick Marber's Closer at the National in 1997 that heralded the internet as a new force in drama. The entirely silent scene in which two men - one posing as a woman - talk dirty on the net, their communications projected on to the back wall, hinted that the virtual world, with its possibilities of disguised identities and lies, might provide a fertile ground for drama. </p> <p>It has not happened yet. The net may have made it into Shakespeare - Lindsay Posner's production of The Taming of the Shrew featured a Christopher Sly slumped in front of a computer, and ATC's multimedia version of the Tempest hinted at a Prospero engaged on both an imaginative and cyber journey - but playwrights seem reluctant to explore the increasing dominance in our culture of new technologies. The gulf between those perceived as techies and those who see themselves as creative seems to be as wide as ever. </p> <p>It seems likely that for the foreseeable future the net's main contribution to theatre will be as a tool for creating work. In 1997 the seven-hour-long, site-specific show Bytes of Bryant Park was created by some of the 50,000 people who visited the Webbed Feats website. </p> <p>There are of course wider ten sions between live performance and cyberspace, theatre and new technologies. If theatre began the 20th century as the dominant art form and the major source of entertainment for most people, it begins the 21st in a much less happy position. Some claim that the new digital technologies will sound the death knell for theatre. </p> <p>This seems as absurd as the idea that the replacement of candlelight with gaslight would destroy all the magic of the stage. After all, old technologies were once new technologies. There was a time when the stage revolve was considered a thing of wonder. </p> <p>Jude Kelly agrees that theatre can look dowdy by comparison with \"sexy\" media such as film and the visual arts, but points out that theatre has always embraced technology to some degree, whether it's the trap door, flying apparatus or computer- ised lighting systems. She believes that while theatre shouldn't try to emulate film, directors need to be more daring in their use of technology. \"Theatre audiences adapt very quickly and there is no reason why they shouldn't adapt to digital technology.\" Kelly is preparing a project with Julian Crouch that involves live actors and cartoon characters. \"The technology is there waiting for ideas. We shouldn't be asking, 'What can the technology do?' but rather, 'What can I do with it?' \" </p> <p>The question needs to be addressed. In a world where interactive is the buzz word, theatre seems to have a huge advantage over its competitors, since it is a medium that creates a community out of isolated individuals and blurs the boundaries between spectator and participant. Harnessed to technology, theatre could perhaps once more take centre stage in our culture. The moment is here; the question is whether theatre has the courage to seize it. </p> <p>Singing in the Rain previews at the National Theatre, London SE1 (020-7452 3000), from next Monday.</p>",

      "bodyText": "At the start of the 21st century, theatre is at last beginning to face up to new technology. The past month alone has produced Blast Theory's Desert Storm, a performance/installation piece on the Gulf war in which audience members are active participants inside a computer game; Fuzzy Logic, a play written entirely on the web; the multimedia spectacle of Laurie Anderson's Moby Dick, and Ulysses's journey re-created via images, light and the interactive movements of a robot and a performer in Marcel Li Antunez Roca's digital performance Afasia. Later this month multimedia moves into the mainstream with the arrival at the National Theatre of Jude Kelly's exuberant version of the MGM classic Singing in the Rain. This light-hearted, all-singing, all-dancing story about the birth of a technology that was to revolutionise movie-making in the 20s (the ability to put sound on film) has been enhanced with modern multimedia technology that embraces graphics, animation and film. Kelly has created a many-layered performance in which the screen and live action comment upon each other, often to comic effect. The result is an evening that snakes backwards and forwards on itself; the 50s musical about the birth of the talkies in 20s Hollywood also appears very sharp, ironic and modern. Apart from its swagger and expertise, there is nothing particularly new about the way that Singing in the Rain uses multi-media. Experimental theatre group Forkbeard Fantasy has spent 20 years melding film and live action in which actors interact not just with each other but also with projected images on a screen. Station House Opera's disturbing Roadmetal Sweetbread presents two lovers whose Miss Julie style power relationship is given a vicious new twist by the constant presence of their on-screen alter-egos. What marks out Singing in the Rain, Forkbeard Fantasy and Station House Opera's work is that they never subjugate the live component to the filmed. The exhilaration is in the head-on smash between one form and another, which creates not a hybrid but something entirely new. What is interesting is that Singing in the Rain emerged not from the more experimental fringes of theatre, but from West Yorkshire Playhouse, a regional theatre often perceived as a bastion of conservatism. Perhaps we should also take heart from the fact that 50 miles away in staid Scarborough you can catch Alan Acykbourn's new comedy Virtual Reality, which takes a jaundiced, but not Luddite, look at our hi-tech world where everyone is plugged in but nobody communicates any more. It was the much-vaunted scene of cyber-sex in Patrick Marber's Closer at the National in 1997 that heralded the internet as a new force in drama. The entirely silent scene in which two men - one posing as a woman - talk dirty on the net, their communications projected on to the back wall, hinted that the virtual world, with its possibilities of disguised identities and lies, might provide a fertile ground for drama. It has not happened yet. The net may have made it into Shakespeare - Lindsay Posner's production of The Taming of the Shrew featured a Christopher Sly slumped in front of a computer, and ATC's multimedia version of the Tempest hinted at a Prospero engaged on both an imaginative and cyber journey - but playwrights seem reluctant to explore the increasing dominance in our culture of new technologies. The gulf between those perceived as techies and those who see themselves as creative seems to be as wide as ever. It seems likely that for the foreseeable future the net's main contribution to theatre will be as a tool for creating work. In 1997 the seven-hour-long, site-specific show Bytes of Bryant Park was created by some of the 50,000 people who visited the Webbed Feats website. There are of course wider ten sions between live performance and cyberspace, theatre and new technologies. If theatre began the 20th century as the dominant art form and the major source of entertainment for most people, it begins the 21st in a much less happy position. Some claim that the new digital technologies will sound the death knell for theatre. This seems as absurd as the idea that the replacement of candlelight with gaslight would destroy all the magic of the stage. After all, old technologies were once new technologies. There was a time when the stage revolve was considered a thing of wonder. Jude Kelly agrees that theatre can look dowdy by comparison with \"sexy\" media such as film and the visual arts, but points out that theatre has always embraced technology to some degree, whether it's the trap door, flying apparatus or computer- ised lighting systems. She believes that while theatre shouldn't try to emulate film, directors need to be more daring in their use of technology. \"Theatre audiences adapt very quickly and there is no reason why they shouldn't adapt to digital technology.\" Kelly is preparing a project with Julian Crouch that involves live actors and cartoon characters. \"The technology is there waiting for ideas. We shouldn't be asking, 'What can the technology do?' but rather, 'What can I do with it?' \" The question needs to be addressed. In a world where interactive is the buzz word, theatre seems to have a huge advantage over its competitors, since it is a medium that creates a community out of isolated individuals and blurs the boundaries between spectator and participant. Harnessed to technology, theatre could perhaps once more take centre stage in our culture. The moment is here; the question is whether theatre has the courage to seize it. Singing in the Rain previews at the National Theatre, London SE1 (020-7452 3000), from next Monday.",

These traumas were presented as Joplin's motivating force in Christopher Morris's <strong> Reputations</strong> profile (BBC2), which revis ited the highlights of the singer's life, with added insight from family, friends and lovers. There's little left to discover among the ruins of that great talent, and certainly some of the footage was over-familiar. That said, it's hard to tire of her 1967 performance of Ball And Chain at the Monterey Festival, and there was a telling footnote to that career-making moment. Joplin, apparently, had already performed one set, dressed in her usual rags with chicken-bone accessories. When the cameras started rolling, however, she whipped on that strange gold lam\u00e9 skirt-trouser combo and did it all over again. Joplin knew that Monterey could be the turning point, and she didn't want to go down in history dressed like a tramp. </p> <p>Her taste in lounge wear wasn't the only thing that set Joplin apart from her hippy peers. While all around her were dropping acid, she preferred a quart of Southern Comfort. While others were content to address themselves to their equally stoned west-coast pals, Joplin craved broader acclaim and longed to go professional - to sell out. Dylan's manager Albert Grossman helped her do just that, and the guilt of leaving behind her flower-child roots added to an already-considerable burden of misery. </p> <p>Happily for the Joplin fans in the audience, Morris's film was affectionate rather than revisionist. There was no suggestion that Joplin was anything other than a superstar, a force of nature and, in her own muddled way, a trail-blazer for a generation of women. She also came across a sharp cookie, at least in earlier interviews before the Judy Garland mannerisms came to dominate her persona. By 1969, however, she'd mutated completely into the character she called \"Pearl\", a hard-drinkin' mamma with half a dozen feather boas pinned into her hair. A defiant trip home to Port Arthur to freak out her classmates at a high school reunion ended in disaster, Joplin caught in the hostile glare of local news coverage, groping for answers and falling to pieces in front of the very people she wanted to knock dead. Sadly, it was Janis who was knocked dead by the experience. Increasingly dependent on heroin, she repaired to LA, cut one more great album and joined Jimi Hendrix and Brian Jones in death. </p> <p>Janis Joplin got her security from audience adoration, from the bottle and the needle. Newcastle businesswoman Alison Edgar gets hers in little pots and tubes, and went into voluntary cold turkey for Channel 4's <strong> Can You Live Without Make-up?</strong> The answer was a pretty resounding no. Emerging from her cosmetic mask looking 10 years younger, Edgar struggled to keep it together at work, and went completely to pieces during a night on the town. Newcastle, we were told, is a city that sets great store by personal appearance - little wonder, then, that even a successful woman like Edgar feels the need to spend \u00a35,000 a year on make-up. Her friends weren't much help. \"The more make-up the better\", said one, a woman who certainly looked as if she'd followed her own creed for a lifetime. The girl at the Versace counter in Fenwick's had applied so much maquillage to her small face that there was barely any room left for features. \"Aubergine - it's the new black!\" she chirped, as Edgar slavered over the testers like an addict. One au naturel week completed, she returned to her old ways, but no longer felt the need to don full war-paint in order to buy a newspaper.

Two men, aged 35 and 44, were arrested at their north London homes shortly after 7am and a third man, aged 42, was arrested almost four hours later. Their identity remains a mystery but it is believed that none is a player or official. \"The men arrested today have been taken to a west London police station for questioning and inquiries are continuing,\" a police spokesman said.
