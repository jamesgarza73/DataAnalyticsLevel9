Sony hopes it will generate an annual profit by its third year. </p> <p>But while it is aiming high, analysts did not expect Sony to become a big financial player overnight. \"Sony is still after all an amateur in this field,\" said Masahiro Ono, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read. </p> <p>The online banking announcement helped fuel a 5.6% rise in Sony's shares in Tokyo to \u00a514,500. The consumer electronics company is to establish a US holding company, Sony Broadband Entertainment, to house Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Pictures Entertainment. </p> <p>The holding company will work to strengthen Sony's online content distribution and examine possible strategic alliances. </p> <p>\"This would stamp out speculation that we may sell the US entertainment units, and shows our strong commitment in reinforcing the content businesses,\" said Mr Idei. </p> <p>Sony is also thinking of listing its internet provider, Sony Communication Network. And it plans to issue $57.3m in convertible bonds to raise money for incentive plans for executives at its US subsidiaries.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sony's chairman, Norio Ohaga, and president Nobuyuki Idei announce their company's online banking alliance with JP Morgan and Japan's Sakura Bank. The online bank, to be capitalised at \u00a537.5bn (\u00a3222m), will be 80% owned by Sony, 16% by Sakura and 4% by JP Morgan. It is due to begin services in the first half of 2001 with a target of one trillion yen in deposits within five years. Sony hopes it will generate an annual profit by its third year. But while it is aiming high, analysts did not expect Sony to become a big financial player overnight. \"Sony is still after all an amateur in this field,\" said Masahiro Ono, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read. The online banking announcement helped fuel a 5.6% rise in Sony's shares in Tokyo to \u00a514,500. The consumer electronics company is to establish a US holding company, Sony Broadband Entertainment, to house Sony Music Entertainment and Sony Pictures Entertainment. The holding company will work to strengthen Sony's online content distribution and examine possible strategic alliances. \"This would stamp out speculation that we may sell the US entertainment units, and shows our strong commitment in reinforcing the content businesses,\" said Mr Idei. Sony is also thinking of listing its internet provider, Sony Communication Network. And it plans to issue $57.3m in convertible bonds to raise money for incentive plans for executives at its US subsidiaries.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A multi-millionaire Dutch businesswoman could have single-handedly spooked the European market for internet shares, it appeared yesterday. </p> <p>Nina Brink, the 46-year-old founder of <a href=\"http://www.WorldOnline.com\" \">World Online</a>, sold 1.2m shares in the company just a day after its \u20ac12bn flotation last week. </p> <p>Her divestment has only just come to light because it was carried out in the name of an obscure US private equity house. However, the transaction has sent World Online's shares plummeting 40% below their debut price. </p> <p>In any normal market, Mrs Brink's windfall would suggest, at worst, a slightly worrying lack of confidence in her company's future share performance. However, in these edgy days of internet hysteria, the transaction has fuelled fundamental concerns about \"herd mentality\" in dot.com valuations. </p> <p>Technology shares had a bad day yesterday, falling 7% in London. That added to a desperate week, which has seen the likes of <a href=\"http://www.Lycos.com\">Lycos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Lastminute.com\">Lastminute.com</a> sink far below their ambitious flotation valuations. Lastminute ended the day down 35p at a low of 252p. </p> <p>To analysts, the most worrying feature of the incident is that it suggests few investors read the World Online prospectus. The document clearly stated that Mrs Brink had siphoned off many of her shares to holding companies, which would not be covered by her six-month lock-in. However, everyone was deeply shocked when they realised she had sold. </p> <p>Peter Bradshaw of Merrill Lynch says: \"You certainly could not describe what's happened there as a net positive for the sector.\" </p> <p>There is a growing feeling that European investors are taking too shallow a view of dot.com companies. </p> <p>Sarah Skinner, of the hi-tech stockbroker Durlacher, says: \"There's a big difference between investors in Europe and the US. In America, there's more actual interest in technology and in companies.

      "bodyText": "A multi-millionaire Dutch businesswoman could have single-handedly spooked the European market for internet shares, it appeared yesterday. Nina Brink, the 46-year-old founder of World Online, sold 1.2m shares in the company just a day after its \u20ac12bn flotation last week. Her divestment has only just come to light because it was carried out in the name of an obscure US private equity house. However, the transaction has sent World Online's shares plummeting 40% below their debut price. In any normal market, Mrs Brink's windfall would suggest, at worst, a slightly worrying lack of confidence in her company's future share performance. However, in these edgy days of internet hysteria, the transaction has fuelled fundamental concerns about \"herd mentality\" in dot.com valuations. Technology shares had a bad day yesterday, falling 7% in London. That added to a desperate week, which has seen the likes of Lycos and Lastminute.com sink far below their ambitious flotation valuations. Lastminute ended the day down 35p at a low of 252p. To analysts, the most worrying feature of the incident is that it suggests few investors read the World Online prospectus. The document clearly stated that Mrs Brink had siphoned off many of her shares to holding companies, which would not be covered by her six-month lock-in. However, everyone was deeply shocked when they realised she had sold. Peter Bradshaw of Merrill Lynch says: \"You certainly could not describe what's happened there as a net positive for the sector.\" There is a growing feeling that European investors are taking too shallow a view of dot.com companies. Sarah Skinner, of the hi-tech stockbroker Durlacher, says: \"There's a big difference between investors in Europe and the US. In America, there's more actual interest in technology and in companies. In the UK and Europe, people just like the idea of getting rich quick rather than having any longer interest in the sector.\" That has made European stocks even more volatile than US ones. Ms Skinner believes it would be incorrect to suggest the dot.com bubble has burst, preferring to see the sell-off as \"a pull-back to quality and a flight to reality\". The effect has been hastened by the arrival of more business-to-business e-commerce companies, which have a much faster route to profitability than the likes of lastminute.com and amazon.com, which are going after the consumer sales. Sharon Coombs, an analyst at HSBC, says: \"We're moving towards the more healthy view that not all of these companies are going to succeed. There's some questioning going on as to whether the new economy is really going to benefit over the next 20 years so much more than the rest of the market.\" Internet service providers are feeling the pinch particularly badly - Freeserve fell 27p to 484p yesterday, its lowest point this year. There is a feeling that Europe is reaching a level of over-supply of these companies. Among the others joining Lastminute.com were Scoot.com, which dropped 41p to \u00a314.96 and QXL.com, which lost 57p to \u00a310.60. The only consolation for lastminute's co-founder Martha Lane Fox is that another dot.com woman, Ms Brink, is feeling the heat.",

      "body": "<p>It's a boy, it's a boy!</p> <p>It's a little boy.</p> <p>I look at this baby - as bald, wrinkled and scrunched up as an old man - and something chemical happens inside me.</p> <p>It - I mean he - looks like the most beautiful baby in the history of the world. Is it - he - really the most beautiful baby in the history of the world? Or is that just my biological programming kicking in? Does everyone feel this way? Even people with plain babies? Is our baby really so beautiful?</p> <p>I honestly can't tell.</p> <p>The baby is sleeping in the arms of the woman I love. I sit on the edge of the bed and stare at the pair of them, feeling like I belong in this room with this woman and this baby in a way that I have never belonged anywhere.</p> <p>After all the excitement of the last twenty-four hours, I am suddenly overwhelmed, feeling something - gratitude, happiness, love - well up inside me and threaten to spill out.</p> <p>I am afraid that I am going to disgrace myself - spoil everything, smudge the moment - with tears. But then the baby wakes up and starts squawking for food and we - me and the woman I love - laugh out loud, laugh with shock and wonder.</p> <p>It's a small miracle. And although we can't escape the reality of everyday life - when do I have to get back to work? - the day is glazed with real magic. We don't really talk about the magic. But we can feel it all around.</p> <p>Later my parents are there. When she is done with the hugs and kisses, my mother counts the baby's fingers and toes, checking for webbed feet. But he is fine, the baby is fine.</p> <p>\"He's a little smasher,\" my mum says. \"A little smasher!\"</p> <p>My father looks at the baby and something inside him seems to melt.</p> <p>There are many good things about my father, but he is not a soft man, he is not a sentimental man. He doesn't gurgle and coo over babies in the street. My father is a good man, but the things he has gone through in his life mean that he is also a hard man. Today some ice deep inside him begins to crack and I can tell he feels it too.</p> <p>This is the most beautiful baby in the world.</p> <p>I give my father a bottle I bought months ago. It is bourbon. My father only drinks beer and whisky, but he takes the bottle with a big grin on his face. The label on the bottle says \"Old Granddad\". That's him. That's my father.</p> <p>And I know today that I have become more like him. Today I am a father too. All the supposed landmarks of manhood - losing my virginity, getting my driving licence, voting for the first time - were all just the outer suburbs of my youth. I went through all those things and came out the other side fundamentally unchanged, still a boy.</p> <p>But now I have helped to bring another human being into the world.</p> <p>Today I became what my father has been for ever.</p> <p>Today I became a man.</p> <p>I am twenty-five years old.</p> <p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p> <p>Some situations to avoid when preparing for your all-important, finally-I-am-fully-grown thirtieth birthday.</p> <p>Having a one-night stand with a colleague from work.</p> <p>The rash purchase of luxury items you can't afford. Being left by your wife.</p> <p>Losing your job.</p> <p>Suddenly becoming a single parent.</p> <p>If you are coming up to thirty, whatever you do, don't do any of that.</p> <p>It will fuck up your whole day.</p> <p>Thirty should be when you think - these are my golden years, these are my salad days, the best is yet to come - and all that old crap. </p> <p>You are still young enough to stay up all night, but you are old enough to have a credit card. All the uncertainties and poverty of your teens and twenties are finally over - and good riddance to the lot of them - but the sap is still rising.</p> <p>Thirty should be a good birthday. One of the best.</p> <p>But how to celebrate reaching the big three-oh? With a collection of laughing single friends in some intimate bar or restaurant? Or surrounded by a loving wife and adoring small children in the bosom of the family home?</p> <p>There has to be a good way of turning thirty. Perhaps they are all good ways.</p> <p>All my images of this particular birthday seemed to be derived from some glossy American sitcom. When I thought of turning thirty, I thought of attractive thirty-nothing marrieds snogging like teens in heat while in the background a gurgling baby crawls across some polished parquet floor, or I saw a circle of good-looking, wise-cracking friends drinking latte and showing off their impressive knitwear while wryly bemoaning the dating game. That was my problem. When I thought of turning thirty, I thought of somebody else's life.</p> <p>That's what thirty should be - grown-up without being disappointed, settled without being complacent, worldly wise, but not so worldly wise that you feel like chucking yourself under a train. The time of your life.</p> <p>By thirty you have finally realised that you are not going to live for ever, of course. But surely that should only make the laughing, latte-drinking present taste even sweeter? You shouldn't let your inevitable death put a damper on things. Don't let the long, slow slide to the grave get in the way of a good time.</p> <p>Whether you are enjoying the last few years of unmarried freedom, or have recently moved on to a more adult, more committed way of life with someone you love, it's difficult to imagine a truly awful way of turning thirty.</p> <p>But I managed to find one somehow.</p> <p>The car smelled like somebody else's life. Like freedom.</p> <p>It was parked right in the window of the showroom, a wedge-shaped sports car which, even with its top off, looked as sleek and compact as a muscle.</p> <p>Naturally it was red - a flaming, testosterone-stuffed red.</p> <p>When I was a little bit younger, such blatant macho corn would have made me sneer, or snigger, or puke, or all of the above.</p> <p>Now I found it didn't bother me at all. In fact, it seemed to be just what I was looking for at this stage of my life.</p> <p>I'm not really the kind of man who knows what cars are called, but I had made it my business - furtively lingering over the ads in glossy magazines - to find out the handle of this particular hot little number. Yes, it's true. Our eyes had met before.</p> <p>But its name didn't really matter. I just loved the way it looked. And that smell. Above all, that smell. That anything-can-happen smell. What was it about that smell?</p> <p>Amidst the perfume of leather, rubber and all those yards of freshly sprayed steel, you could smell a heartbreaking newness, a newness so shocking that it almost overwhelmed me. This newness intimated another world that was limitless and free, an open road leading to all the unruined days of the future. Somewhere they had never heard of traffic cones or physical decay or my thirtieth birthday.</p> <p>I knew that smell from somewhere and I recognised the way it made me feel. Funnily enough, it reminded me of that feeling you get when you hold a newborn baby.</p> <p>The analogy was far from perfect - the car couldn't squint up at me with eyes that had just started to see, or grasp one of my fingers in a tiny, tiny fist, or give me a gummy little smile. But for a moment there it felt like it just might.</p> <p>\"You only live once,\" the car salesman said, his heels clicking across the showroom floor.</p> <p>I smiled politely, indicating that I would have to think that one over.</p> <p>\"Are you in the market for some serious fun?\" he said. \"Because if the MGF is about one thing, it's about fun.\"</p> <p>While he gave me his standard sales pitch, he was sizing me up, trying to decide if I was worth a test drive.</p> <p>He was pushy, but not so pushy that it made your flesh crawl. He was just doing his job. And despite my weekend clothes - which because of the nature of my work were not really so different from my weekday clothes - he must have seen a man of substance. A fast-track career looking for some matching wheels. Young, free and single. A life as carefree as a lager commercial. How wrong can you be?</p> <p>\"This model has the Variable Valve Control system,\" he said, with what seemed like genuine enthusiasm. \"The opening period of the inlet valves can be varied by altering the rotational speed of each cam lobe.\"</p> <p>What the fuck was he going on about? Was it something to do with the engine?</p> <p>\"A total babe magnet,\" he said, noting my dumbfounded expression. \"Plenty of poke. A young single guy couldn't do any better than the MGE.\"</p> <p>This was my kind of sales pitch. Forget the technical guff, just tell me that you can lose yourself in a car like this. Let me know you can lose yourself. That's what I wanted to hear.</p> <p>The salesman was distracted by something on the street, and I followed his gaze out of the showroom's plate-glass wall.</p> <p>He was looking at a tall blonde woman holding the hand of a small boy wearing a Star Wars T-shirt. They were surrounded by bags of supermarket shopping. And they were watching us.</p> <p>Even framed by all those plastic carrier bags and chaperoning a little kid, the woman was the kind that you look at more than once.</p> <p>What you noticed about her child - and he was certainly her child - was that he was carrying a long, plastic tube with a dull light glowing faintly inside.</p> <p>If you had been to the cinema at any time over the last twenty years you would recognise it as a light sabre, traditional weapon of the Jedi Knights. This one. needed new batteries.</p> <p>The beautiful woman was smiling at me and the salesman. The little kid pointed his light sabre, as if about to strike us down.</p> <p>\"Daddy,\" he mouthed from the other side of the plate-glass wall which divided us. You couldn't hear him, but that's what he was saying.</p> <p>\"My wife and son,\" I said, turning away, but not before I caught the disappointment in the salesman's eyes. \"Got to go.\"</p> <p>Daddy. That's me. Daddy.</p> <p> \"You don't even like cars,\" my wife reminded me, edging our old VW estate through the thick early evening traffic.</p> <p>\"Just looking.\"</p> <p>\"And you're too young for a mid-life crisis,\" she said. \"Thirty is much too young, Harry. The way it works, you wait for fifteen years and then run off with a secretary who's young enough to be your second wife. And I cut off the sleeves of all your suits. Not to mention your bollocks.\"</p> <p>\"I'm not thirty, Gina,\" I chuckled, although it wasn't really all that funny. She was always exaggerating. \"I'm twenty-nine.\"</p> <p>\"For one more month!\" she laughed.</p> <p>\"It's your birthday soon,\" our boy said, laughing along with his mother, although he didn't have a clue why, and tapping me on the back of the head with his sodding light sabre.</p> <p>\"Please don't do that, Pat,\" I said.</p> <p>He was back there with the week's shopping, strapped into his little car seat and muttering under his breath, pretending to be in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon with Harrison Ford.</p> <p>\"I've lost my starboard engine,\" he jabbered away to himself. \"Fire when ready.\"</p> <p>I turned to look at him. He was four years old with dirty blond hair that hung down over eyes that were the same shade of blue as his mother's. Tiffany blue. Catching my eye, he grinned at me with pure childish delight.</p> <p>\"Happy birthday, dear Daddy,\" he sang. \"Happy birthday, birth-day.\"</p> <p>To Pat, my birthday was a chance to finally give me the home-made card he had hidden under his bed (Luke Skywalker decapitating a space monster with his trusty light sabre). To me it meant that the best might already be over. It really did.</p> <p>When would I feel the way I felt the night my wife said that she would marry me? When would I feel the way I felt the morning my son was born? When would life be that - I don't know - real again? When?</p> <p>\"When did you become interested in cars?\" Gina asked.</p> <p>She wouldn't let this car thing rest. \"I bet you don't even know what kind of petrol this one uses, do you?\"</p> <p>\"Oh, come on, Gina.\"</p> <p>\"What is it, then?\"</p> <p>Fucking hell.</p> <p>\"The green kind,\" I said, taking a wild guess. \"You know - non-leaded. The one that saves a rain forest every time you fill her up.\"</p> <p>\"It's diesel, you doughnut,\" she laughed. \"I never knew a man less interested in cars than you. What happened?\"</p> <p>What could I tell her? You don't tell a wife that some inanimate object somehow represents all those things you know you are never going to have. The places you are never going to see, the women you are never going to love, the things you are never going to do. You can't tell a wife all that stuff. Not even a wife you love very much. Especially not a wife like that.</p> <p>\"It only carries one passenger,\" she said.</p> <p>\"What does?\" I said, playing dumb.</p> <p>\"You know very well what I'm talking about,\" she said. \"It only carries one passenger - one thin, female passenger.\"</p> <p>\"You're still pretty thin and female,\" I said. \"Or you were the last time I looked.\"</p> <p>\"What's brought all this on, Harry? Come on. Tell me.\"</p> <p>\"Maybe I'm compensating for becoming an old git,\" I said. \"I'm joining the old gits' club, so, pathetically, I want to recapture my glorious youth. Even though I know it's ultimately futile and even though my youth wasn't particularly glorious. Isn't that what men do?\"</p> <p>You're turning thirty,\" she said. \"We're going to open a couple of bottles and have a nice cake with candles.\"</p> <p>\"And balloons,\" Pat said.</p> <p>\"And balloons,\" Gina said. She shook her lovely head. \"We're not having you put down, Harry.\"</p> <p>Gina was a couple of months older than me. She had breezed through her thirtieth birthday surrounded by friends and family, dancing with her son to Wham's greatest hits, a glass of champagne in her hand. She looked great that night, she really did. But clearly my own birthday was going to be a bit more traumatic.</p> <p>\"You don't regret anything, do you?' she said.</p> <p>\"Like what?\"</p> <p>\"You know,\" she said, suddenly deadly serious. \"Like us.\"</p> <p>We had married young. Gina was three months pregnant with Pat on our wedding day and it was, by some distance, the happiest day of my life. But nothing was ever really the same again after that day. Because after that there was no disguising the fact that we were grown-ups.</p> <p>The radio station where I was working gave me the week off and we spent our honeymoon back at our little flat watching daytime television in bed, eating M &amp; S sandwiches and talking about the beautiful baby we were going to have.</p> <p>We talked about eventually taking a proper, grown-up honeymoon - Gina wanted us to snorkel among the tropical fish of Okinawa. But by the time there was a bit of money and a bit of time, we had Pat and the course of our lives seemed set.</p> <p>Gina and I found ourselves separated from the rest of the world by our wedding rings. The other married couples we knew were at least ten years older than us, and friends our own age were still in that brief period between living with their mothers and living with their mortgages. Our little family was on its own.</p> <p>While our friends were dancing the night away in clubs, we were up all hours with our baby's teething problems. While they were worrying about meeting the right person, we were worrying about meeting the payments on our first real home. Yet I didn't regret any of it. Yes, we had given up our freedom. But we had given it up for something better.</p> <p>I loved my wife and I loved our son. Together, the two of them made my world make sense. My life without them was unimaginable. I knew I was a lucky man. But I couldn't help it, I just couldn't help it - lately I found myself wondering when I had stopped being young.</p> <p>\"I just really hate the way that life starts to contract as you get older,\" I said. \"The way your options narrow. I mean, when did owning a car like that become ridiculous for me? When exactly? Why is it such a joke? I would love to know. That's all.\"</p> <p>\"The Force is strong in this one,\" Pat said.</p> <p>\"A red sports car,\" Gina said to herself. \"And you don't even like driving.\"</p> <p>\"Listen, I was just looking, okay?\" I said.</p> <p>\"Happy birthday to you,\" Pat sang, smacking me across the ear with his light sabre. \"Squashed tomatoes and glue. You-look-like-a-monkey-and-you-act-like-one-too.\"</p> <p>\"That's not nice,\" I told him, as the traffic ground to a halt and my ear began to throb.</p> <p>Gina put the handbrake on and looked at me, as if trying to remember what she had liked about me in the first place. She seemed a bit stumped.</p> <p>I remembered what I had liked about her. She had the longest legs I had ever seen on a woman. But I still didn't know if that was the best basis for the love of your life.</p> <p>Or the worst.</p> <p>Extracted with permission from Man and Boy by Tony Parsons (HarperCollins).

Chapter One Some situations to avoid when preparing for your all-important, finally-I-am-fully-grown thirtieth birthday. Having a one-night stand with a colleague from work. The rash purchase of luxury items you can't afford. Being left by your wife. Losing your job. Suddenly becoming a single parent. If you are coming up to thirty, whatever you do, don't do any of that. It will fuck up your whole day. Thirty should be when you think - these are my golden years, these are my salad days, the best is yet to come - and all that old crap. You are still young enough to stay up all night, but you are old enough to have a credit card. All the uncertainties and poverty of your teens and twenties are finally over - and good riddance to the lot of them - but the sap is still rising. Thirty should be a good birthday. One of the best. But how to celebrate reaching the big three-oh? With a collection of laughing single friends in some intimate bar or restaurant? Or surrounded by a loving wife and adoring small children in the bosom of the family home? There has to be a good way of turning thirty. Perhaps they are all good ways. All my images of this particular birthday seemed to be derived from some glossy American sitcom. When I thought of turning thirty, I thought of attractive thirty-nothing marrieds snogging like teens in heat while in the background a gurgling baby crawls across some polished parquet floor, or I saw a circle of good-looking, wise-cracking friends drinking latte and showing off their impressive knitwear while wryly bemoaning the dating game. That was my problem. When I thought of turning thirty, I thought of somebody else's life. That's what thirty should be - grown-up without being disappointed, settled without being complacent, worldly wise, but not so worldly wise that you feel like chucking yourself under a train. The time of your life. By thirty you have finally realised that you are not going to live for ever, of course. But surely that should only make the laughing, latte-drinking present taste even sweeter? You shouldn't let your inevitable death put a damper on things. Don't let the long, slow slide to the grave get in the way of a good time. Whether you are enjoying the last few years of unmarried freedom, or have recently moved on to a more adult, more committed way of life with someone you love, it's difficult to imagine a truly awful way of turning thirty. But I managed to find one somehow. The car smelled like somebody else's life. Like freedom. It was parked right in the window of the showroom, a wedge-shaped sports car which, even with its top off, looked as sleek and compact as a muscle. Naturally it was red - a flaming, testosterone-stuffed red. When I was a little bit younger, such blatant macho corn would have made me sneer, or snigger, or puke, or all of the above. Now I found it didn't bother me at all. In fact, it seemed to be just what I was looking for at this stage of my life. I'm not really the kind of man who knows what cars are called, but I had made it my business - furtively lingering over the ads in glossy magazines - to find out the handle of this particular hot little number. Yes, it's true. Our eyes had met before. But its name didn't really matter. I just loved the way it looked. And that smell. Above all, that smell. That anything-can-happen smell. What was it about that smell? Amidst the perfume of leather, rubber and all those yards of freshly sprayed steel, you could smell a heartbreaking newness, a newness so shocking that it almost overwhelmed me. This newness intimated another world that was limitless and free, an open road leading to all the unruined days of the future. Somewhere they had never heard of traffic cones or physical decay or my thirtieth birthday. I knew that smell from somewhere and I recognised the way it made me feel. Funnily enough, it reminded me of that feeling you get when you hold a newborn baby. The analogy was far from perfect - the car couldn't squint up at me with eyes that had just started to see, or grasp one of my fingers in a tiny, tiny fist, or give me a gummy little smile. But for a moment there it felt like it just might. \"You only live once,\" the car salesman said, his heels clicking across the showroom floor. I smiled politely, indicating that I would have to think that one over. \"Are you in the market for some serious fun?\" he said. \"Because if the MGF is about one thing, it's about fun.\" While he gave me his standard sales pitch, he was sizing me up, trying to decide if I was worth a test drive. He was pushy, but not so pushy that it made your flesh crawl. He was just doing his job. And despite my weekend clothes - which because of the nature of my work were not really so different from my weekday clothes - he must have seen a man of substance. A fast-track career looking for some matching wheels. Young, free and single. A life as carefree as a lager commercial. How wrong can you be? \"This model has the Variable Valve Control system,\" he said, with what seemed like genuine enthusiasm. \"The opening period of the inlet valves can be varied by altering the rotational speed of each cam lobe.\" What the fuck was he going on about? Was it something to do with the engine? \"A total babe magnet,\" he said, noting my dumbfounded expression. \"Plenty of poke. A young single guy couldn't do any better than the MGE.\" This was my kind of sales pitch. Forget the technical guff, just tell me that you can lose yourself in a car like this. Let me know you can lose yourself. That's what I wanted to hear. The salesman was distracted by something on the street, and I followed his gaze out of the showroom's plate-glass wall. He was looking at a tall blonde woman holding the hand of a small boy wearing a Star Wars T-shirt. They were surrounded by bags of supermarket shopping. And they were watching us. Even framed by all those plastic carrier bags and chaperoning a little kid, the woman was the kind that you look at more than once. What you noticed about her child - and he was certainly her child - was that he was carrying a long, plastic tube with a dull light glowing faintly inside. If you had been to the cinema at any time over the last twenty years you would recognise it as a light sabre, traditional weapon of the Jedi Knights. This one. needed new batteries. The beautiful woman was smiling at me and the salesman. The little kid pointed his light sabre, as if about to strike us down. \"Daddy,\" he mouthed from the other side of the plate-glass wall which divided us.

Not to mention your bollocks.\" \"I'm not thirty, Gina,\" I chuckled, although it wasn't really all that funny. She was always exaggerating. \"I'm twenty-nine.\" \"For one more month!\" she laughed. \"It's your birthday soon,\" our boy said, laughing along with his mother, although he didn't have a clue why, and tapping me on the back of the head with his sodding light sabre. \"Please don't do that, Pat,\" I said. He was back there with the week's shopping, strapped into his little car seat and muttering under his breath, pretending to be in the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon with Harrison Ford. \"I've lost my starboard engine,\" he jabbered away to himself. \"Fire when ready.\" I turned to look at him. He was four years old with dirty blond hair that hung down over eyes that were the same shade of blue as his mother's. Tiffany blue. Catching my eye, he grinned at me with pure childish delight. \"Happy birthday, dear Daddy,\" he sang. \"Happy birthday, birth-day.\" To Pat, my birthday was a chance to finally give me the home-made card he had hidden under his bed (Luke Skywalker decapitating a space monster with his trusty light sabre). To me it meant that the best might already be over. It really did. When would I feel the way I felt the night my wife said that she would marry me? When would I feel the way I felt the morning my son was born? When would life be that - I don't know - real again? When? \"When did you become interested in cars?\" Gina asked. She wouldn't let this car thing rest. \"I bet you don't even know what kind of petrol this one uses, do you?\" \"Oh, come on, Gina.\" \"What is it, then?\" Fucking hell. \"The green kind,\" I said, taking a wild guess. \"You know - non-leaded. The one that saves a rain forest every time you fill her up.\" \"It's diesel, you doughnut,\" she laughed. \"I never knew a man less interested in cars than you. What happened?\" What could I tell her? You don't tell a wife that some inanimate object somehow represents all those things you know you are never going to have. The places you are never going to see, the women you are never going to love, the things you are never going to do. You can't tell a wife all that stuff. Not even a wife you love very much. Especially not a wife like that. \"It only carries one passenger,\" she said. \"What does?\" I said, playing dumb. \"You know very well what I'm talking about,\" she said. \"It only carries one passenger - one thin, female passenger.\" \"You're still pretty thin and female,\" I said. \"Or you were the last time I looked.\" \"What's brought all this on, Harry? Come on. Tell me.\" \"Maybe I'm compensating for becoming an old git,\" I said. \"I'm joining the old gits' club, so, pathetically, I want to recapture my glorious youth. Even though I know it's ultimately futile and even though my youth wasn't particularly glorious. Isn't that what men do?\" You're turning thirty,\" she said. \"We're going to open a couple of bottles and have a nice cake with candles.\" \"And balloons,\" Pat said. \"And balloons,\" Gina said. She shook her lovely head. \"We're not having you put down, Harry.\" Gina was a couple of months older than me. She had breezed through her thirtieth birthday surrounded by friends and family, dancing with her son to Wham's greatest hits, a glass of champagne in her hand. She looked great that night, she really did. But clearly my own birthday was going to be a bit more traumatic. \"You don't regret anything, do you?' she said. \"Like what?\" \"You know,\" she said, suddenly deadly serious. \"Like us.\" We had married young. Gina was three months pregnant with Pat on our wedding day and it was, by some distance, the happiest day of my life. But nothing was ever really the same again after that day. Because after that there was no disguising the fact that we were grown-ups. The radio station where I was working gave me the week off and we spent our honeymoon back at our little flat watching daytime television in bed, eating M &amp; S sandwiches and talking about the beautiful baby we were going to have. We talked about eventually taking a proper, grown-up honeymoon - Gina wanted us to snorkel among the tropical fish of Okinawa. But by the time there was a bit of money and a bit of time, we had Pat and the course of our lives seemed set. Gina and I found ourselves separated from the rest of the world by our wedding rings. The other married couples we knew were at least ten years older than us, and friends our own age were still in that brief period between living with their mothers and living with their mortgages. Our little family was on its own. While our friends were dancing the night away in clubs, we were up all hours with our baby's teething problems. While they were worrying about meeting the right person, we were worrying about meeting the payments on our first real home. Yet I didn't regret any of it. Yes, we had given up our freedom. But we had given it up for something better. I loved my wife and I loved our son. Together, the two of them made my world make sense. My life without them was unimaginable. I knew I was a lucky man. But I couldn't help it, I just couldn't help it - lately I found myself wondering when I had stopped being young. \"I just really hate the way that life starts to contract as you get older,\" I said. \"The way your options narrow. I mean, when did owning a car like that become ridiculous for me? When exactly? Why is it such a joke? I would love to know. That's all.\" \"The Force is strong in this one,\" Pat said. \"A red sports car,\" Gina said to herself. \"And you don't even like driving.\" \"Listen, I was just looking, okay?\" I said. \"Happy birthday to you,\" Pat sang, smacking me across the ear with his light sabre. \"Squashed tomatoes and glue. You-look-like-a-monkey-and-you-act-like-one-too.\" \"That's not nice,\" I told him, as the traffic ground to a halt and my ear began to throb. Gina put the handbrake on and looked at me, as if trying to remember what she had liked about me in the first place. She seemed a bit stumped. I remembered what I had liked about her. She had the longest legs I had ever seen on a woman. But I still didn't know if that was the best basis for the love of your life. Or the worst.

A petition of 2,000 signatures collected by a hastily formed group called Glastonbury Residents Oppose Microwave Masts in Town (Grommit) was turned down by the local authorities and appeals to the company and Downing Street were ignored.</p> <p>It's a similar story at Bedonwel junior school in Belvedere, Kent. There a group of parents have been refusing to allow their children to go to school because they say radiation from the mast in the school grounds could be damaging.</p> <p>The Glastonbury and Belvedere residents are echoed by communities in Somerset, Yorkshire, Surrey, Lancashire and Scotland. They have been joined by pressure groups as diverse as Friends of the Earth, the Council for the Protection of Rural England, the Country Landowners Association, ramblers, mountaineers and hillwalkers, all of whom have been fighting to stop masts being erected on top of hospitals, council flats and in areas of outstanding natural beauty.</p> <p>And at last it seems they have not been complaining in vain. Yesterday an environment committee of the Scottish parliament recommended that all telecoms masts, including those for mobile phones, should be required to apply for planning permission, and that local authorities should adopt the \"precautionary principle\", keeping masts away from schools, hospitals and residential areas. If this passes into law, it will be the first brake on the breathtaking mobile phone revolution, which has seen 25m Britons buy handsets in just a few years. The backlash has started in earnest.</p> <p>Nobody knows - or at least the companies, the government, local councils, Oftel and the Federation of Electronic Industries are unwilling or unable to say - quite how many masts and relay stations there are. Given that Orange, one of the four licensed providers, has said that it should have erected 10,000 masts by the end of the year and the three other operators - BT Cellnet, One 2 One and Vodafone - claim roughly equal coverage of Britain, there could be more than 35,000.</p> <p>But we are only on the the edge of the new telecommunications forest. Within a few years there will be tens of thousands more masts. The exact number depends on how many of us turn to cellular phones and for what reason. Because each mast can, for the moment, only handle a few hundred calls at any given time, the existing infrastructure is beginning to prove inadequate.</p> <p>Within two years, the companies expect there to be 40m mobile phones in use; within eight years not only do they expect just about everyone in the country to have one, they expect us to be well into the third generation of phones. This is the universal mobile telephone system (UMTS), which will allow people to send huge amounts of data and pictures to their mobile phones via the internet. To guarantee good connections, this system will need vastly more masts and relay stations.</p> <p>But the telecommunications forest will spread further. The police and the emergency services are now linking with corporations to build a major system of their own, and a fifth major operator will shortly be given a licence. Each is expected to build thousands more masts.</p> <p>The prize for the telecoms winners is huge. The hype has it that within 10 years cellular technology will handle almost 90% of all the telephone calls and data transmission at present travelling by landline. In the cities, it will mean masts, satellite dish transmitters and relay stations positioned every few hundred yards, mainly on buildings. Most will be relatively unobtrusive - often no more than small dishes or boxes attached to lamp-posts. The companies will try to expand the existing masts by tagging on new pieces of equipment, but very many will be brand new. In the country, depending on the terrain, the freestanding masts may in future have to be placed every few miles.</p> <p>Hundreds of communities will have to increase their efforts if they want to stave off an invasion. \"Opposing masts is hard,\" says Alison Tisdall, who with other Wiltshire residents objected strongly to a Vodafone mast planned just a few hundred metres from houses. \"You cannot object on health and safety grounds; the government only accepts arguments about the thermal effects, which are impossible to prove\". In the end, Vodafone withdrew its application when it was found that the council did not own the site of the planned mast. However, now there are other applications - to extend existing masts - being advanced by other companies.</p> <p>The objections are not solely on health grounds. \"We fought and fought,\" says Grace Jones, who, with other, opposed construction of a mast on the edge of the Peak District. \"It was like punching air. The company was not interested in our concerns. They did not consult us. We felt utterly powerless to stop them spoiling a wonderful view.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile in Guildford, Surrey, more than 15 masts have been erected since 1993 and at least 40 more in outlying areas. It is deeply frustrating for councillors, who in most cases have no way of controlling where masts are built and cannot persuade the companies to share masts. Nigel Sutclife, a borough councillor, has watched helplessly as up to six companies have each built their own mast in the same area, mostly bypassing the planning system. \"If the previous government had required companies to cooperate, then we would have had a good network with a third or fewer of the masts, making huge savings in cost and environmental damage,\" he says.</p> <p>But pressure is growing for government to review its guidelines, which say that councils should not question the need for a service or try to prevent competition between companies. In the next few weeks a report similar to that given to the Scottish parliament yesterday should go to the Department of Trade and Industry. It follows an early day motion, so far signed by more than 150 MPs, calling for precaution and more control. The local government association representing 150 local authorities throughout England and Wales has strongly criticised central government policy and also come down heavily in favour of banning masts from schools, hospitals and residential areas.</p> <p>Many of the masts that are already in place may now be under threat. Earlier this month, a government planning inspector from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions ruled that a much disputed Vodafone mast in Leeds had breached planning laws because the company, in calculating its maximum height, had not included the plinth on which the mast stands. The company has been given six weeks to remove the mast or lodge an appeal in the high court.</p> <p>The companies - eager to present the best case before the new licensing round - admit mistakes have been made in siting some masts, but claim that they are now acting responsibly and consulting more widely. In fact they are learning where they will attract the least opposition. Considerable rents have been offered and accepted and more than 500 cash-strapped schools and dozens of hospitals and council flats now sprout tall masts. One Scottish council is believed to receive more than \u00a3800,000 a year from its masts.</p> <p>But equally, many other councils are now objecting strongly on health grounds and, to the despair of the companies, are banning masts from all council properties. Over a third of all local planning authorities in Scotland and a growing number in England have adopted the precautionary principle.</p> <p>The companies know their masts are eyesores and that the debate on the health effects is growing. They are, superficially at least, trying to address the problems. In place of the old gridiron constructions, which are the most unpopular, they are turning to tall, slim models and sponsoring designs that disguise masts as trees, lamp-posts, art works and flagpoles.</p> <p>\"We are as sympathetic to the environment as possible\", says an Orange spokesman. \"Our preference is always to use existing structures and to share masts. But sometimes we cannot. We only ever build a new site where no viable alternative exists.\"</p> <p>The future may be Orange, but it's not at all clear how communities will react when the full network of masts is rolled out and further research is done on the health effects. In Ireland, they haven't waited to find out. There have been major demonstrations and several communities have pulled down the masts in the dead of night.</p> <p>\"Here in Glengarrif, County Cork, they put up a mast near the school,\" says Denise Hall. \"The next thing, it was down.

In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company's compensation committee suggests that this situation may change. </p> <p>\"Mr Bezos' compensation was considerably less than may have been paid to an individual with similar responsibilities in a similar industry,\" it said. \"Due to Mr Bezos' substantial ownership in the company, Mr Bezos requested not to receive additional compensation in 1999.\" </p> <p>The filing goes on to warn that it may need to \"increase salaries, award additional stock options or provide other short- and long-term incentive compensation to executive officers, including Mr Bezos\" in order to \"attract, retain and motivate key personnel\". </p> <p>The factors which could provoke such a review are all outlined in detail in the rest of the filing.

      "bodyText": "Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com, received just $81,840 for his role as the head of the world's biggest online retailer last year after refusing a pay increase. One of the world's wealthiest men, and America's second richest under 40, insisted that his 34% stake in the company was adequate compensation for his position. At yesterday's share price, Mr Bezos, who is 35, was worth about $7.6bn. In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the company's compensation committee suggests that this situation may change. \"Mr Bezos' compensation was considerably less than may have been paid to an individual with similar responsibilities in a similar industry,\" it said. \"Due to Mr Bezos' substantial ownership in the company, Mr Bezos requested not to receive additional compensation in 1999.\" The filing goes on to warn that it may need to \"increase salaries, award additional stock options or provide other short- and long-term incentive compensation to executive officers, including Mr Bezos\" in order to \"attract, retain and motivate key personnel\". The factors which could provoke such a review are all outlined in detail in the rest of the filing. To head off any potential litigation from disappointed investors, Amazon is among several internet companies to offer warnings about catastrophes that could land it in financial trouble. Among these is one that reads: \"The long-term viability of the internet as a medium for commerce is not certain\".

      "trailText": "<p>Fed up with estate agent spin and exorbitant fees? Your dream home may be just a double click away.  <strong>Esther Addley</strong> on the rise of online house-buying</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Buying your house online is still far from the norm: there's not even a standard irritating internet term for it yet (e-state agency? e-house trading?). </p> <p>But last year alone, around 70,000 houses and flats were bought online in this country, with buyers saving an estimated \u00a3100m in estate agent fees and other costs. That may sound like quite a lot, but the experts say it's nothing compared with what's around the corner. They say that, sooner rather than later, the internet will be the first place people go when they're buying a new home. </p> <p>Neil Mackwood, editorial director of the property sales site 08004homes.com, says that what consumers want when they are looking for a new property is information, plain and simple - which the net can provide in spades. At its most basic, the property market is about putting buyers in touch with sellers, which the internet's perfect for. </p> <p>\"One of the most inefficient aspects of modern life is buying and selling a house,\" says Mackwood. \"It's such a waste of shoe leather going from window to window to buy and sell a property. I thought if you could get all the houses that are available for sale in one place you would have the most phenomenal service.\" </p> <p>His site, then called home2home, was one of the earliest online property sites, and is now claimed to carry details of 75,000 houses nationwide. Would-be purchasers key in their budget, preferred area and number of bedrooms, and with a click of the mouse immediately access every property on the site that meets their specifications. </p> <p>When it works, it works well. Any means of getting information before the rest of the pack gives a buyer an enormous advantage and if you can access property details from your desk and at your leisure, so much the better. </p> <p>Richard Houseago, a solicitor in the City, is a success story for buying a home online. He was beginning to despair after losing out on several houses when, with an impatient buyer waiting to exchange contracts on the house he was selling, his wife suggested he look on the net. </p> <p>\"I started in my lunchtimes looking through some of the property sites,\" he says, \"On the third day, I came across a property not only in the area that we were looking in, but actually in the road of my children's school. There was a very clear picture of the house. I emailed the agent back there and then, saying we were very interested.\" </p> <p>Within a couple of hours Houseago had viewed the house. \"We offered on it on the spot, and we completed the sale within four weeks.\" </p> <p>The obvious advantage of buying online is that you can scan a large number of properties without wearing out your shoes, but finding your way through the maze of different types of sites - with variable quality of information - can still be as daunting as driving round your chosen area trying to spot \"For Sale\" signs. </p> <p>The fact that two of the best-known sites launched less than two months ago illustrates how new the market still is - just as the differences between them neatly sum up its diversity. Rightmove.co.uk, which launched at the beginning of March, is a collaboration between housing giants Halifax, Countrywide Assured, Royal &amp; Sun Alliance and Cornells, pooling the properties on each of their books in one site. Now one of the largest UK property sites with 120,000 properties, Rightmove's start-up indicates the importance the big estate agents now attach to online searches. Buyers can look at lots of houses online, but after that the selling process continues just as it would have if you'd spotted the house in an estate agents' window. </p> <p>The launch of easier.co.uk just two weeks earlier, however, was a genuine internet innovation. Working on the principle that estate agents are nothing more than information exchanges - putting potential buyers in contact with would-be sellers - easier.co.uk dispenses with their services altogether by letting purchasers and vendors talk to each other directly. There is no fee to search for a property and the vendor pays no commission on the sale, allowing the company to claim that it manages the entire process \"faster, cheaper and better\" than traditional estate agents. </p> <p>\"We wanted to create a market that was fair to both buyers and sellers,\" says Easier's founder and joint chief executive, Steve Rist. \"We don't work on the basis of sales, and we don't take success-linked fees, so we are a disinterested party in terms of the transaction.\" </p> <p>Putting aside the forgivable spin, Rist may prove to have a point when he claims to be about to alter the housing market. The arrival of Easier on the scene, he says, is comparable with the influence of telephone broker Direct Line on the insurance broking market. When one company proved it was possible to offer cover more cheaply and conveniently established brokers hurriedly developed their service in line with heightened customer expectations. </p> <p> The fact that an Easier sale on a \u00a3200,000 property would save \u00a33,000-\u00a34,000 on agent's commission makes the site an attractive prospect to vendors, and estate agents are likely to be watching the site's progress nervously. But Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy, chief executive of the national association of estate agents, scoffs at the notion that net technology threatens the high street estate agent. </p> <p>\"There's a lot of hype over the internet. It's a way of communicating with people en masse, and it brings tremendous opportunities. But it's only a tool for communication. It doesn't replace the personal skills that an agent is bringing to the sale. </p> <p>\"There are many facets of buying that the internet will not replace,\" he says. \"Most busy people like to instruct agents, to let them show the house, and let the agents who are trained negotiators to actually negotiate on their behalf.\" </p> <p>But with sites such as Easier offering valuation, key-holding and conveyancing services, estate agents will be forced to develop their services in order to stay competitive. </p> <p>\"We will see estate agents taking control into their own hands with big joint sites,\" says Rist. \"We'll see commissions slashed. In this day and age, unless you can provide really good value and customer service, you're not going to be around for much longer.\" </p> <p><strong>Online estate agents</strong></p> <p><strong><a href=\" http://www.winkworth.co.uk\"> www.winkworth.co.uk</a> </strong></p> <p><strong> How does it work? </strong> Houses are selected online - some can be viewed in 360 degrees - and would-be buyers then email the relevant office of the agent direct. The process then continues like a normal sale. <br> </p> <p><strong> How do they make money?</strong> The estate agent charges commission at 1.5-2% on the sale, whether sold online or through a shop window. </p> <p><strong> Advantages:</strong> More convenient than trekking around the company's 37 London offices. </p> <p><strong> Disadvantages: </strong> Individual agents' offices may be slow to update sites. Limited number of properties in any given area. </p> <p><strong> <a href=\"http://www.rightmove.co.uk\">www.rightmove.co.uk</a></strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> How does it work?</strong> Collaboration between several estate agents, in this case Halifax, Countrywide Assured, Royal &amp; Sun Alliance and Connells. Buyers view properties online, after which the relevant agent is contacted direct to take over on the sale process. </p> <p><strong> How do they make money?</strong> Commission on each sale. </p> <p><strong> Advantages:</strong> More properties than by maintaining individual sites. </p> <p><strong> Disadvantages:</strong> Critics argue that it is not in agents' interests to immediately remove sold properties, as this allows them to claim a larger number of houses on their books. </p> <p><strong> <a href=\"http://www.08004homes.com\">www.08004homes.com</a></strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> How does it work?</strong> A private site (not linked directly to an estate agency) that lists properties for sale from a variety of individual estate agencies. </p> <p><strong> How do they make money? </strong> There are banner ads on the site, so the number of site hits is important. </p> <p><strong> Advantages:</strong> Large number of properties - 08004homes.com claims 75,000 - and not limited to a few agencies. </p> <p><strong> Disadvantages:</strong> Coverage may not be comprehensive - the site lists only houses that it has become aware of. </p> <p><strong> <a href=\"http://www.easier.co.uk\">www.easier.co.uk</a></strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> How does it work?</strong> Puts buyers and sellers in direct contact with each other, cutting out the need for an agent.

      "bodyText": "Buying your house online is still far from the norm: there's not even a standard irritating internet term for it yet (e-state agency? e-house trading?). But last year alone, around 70,000 houses and flats were bought online in this country, with buyers saving an estimated \u00a3100m in estate agent fees and other costs. That may sound like quite a lot, but the experts say it's nothing compared with what's around the corner. They say that, sooner rather than later, the internet will be the first place people go when they're buying a new home. Neil Mackwood, editorial director of the property sales site 08004homes.com, says that what consumers want when they are looking for a new property is information, plain and simple - which the net can provide in spades. At its most basic, the property market is about putting buyers in touch with sellers, which the internet's perfect for. \"One of the most inefficient aspects of modern life is buying and selling a house,\" says Mackwood. \"It's such a waste of shoe leather going from window to window to buy and sell a property. I thought if you could get all the houses that are available for sale in one place you would have the most phenomenal service.\" His site, then called home2home, was one of the earliest online property sites, and is now claimed to carry details of 75,000 houses nationwide. Would-be purchasers key in their budget, preferred area and number of bedrooms, and with a click of the mouse immediately access every property on the site that meets their specifications. When it works, it works well. Any means of getting information before the rest of the pack gives a buyer an enormous advantage and if you can access property details from your desk and at your leisure, so much the better. Richard Houseago, a solicitor in the City, is a success story for buying a home online. He was beginning to despair after losing out on several houses when, with an impatient buyer waiting to exchange contracts on the house he was selling, his wife suggested he look on the net. \"I started in my lunchtimes looking through some of the property sites,\" he says, \"On the third day, I came across a property not only in the area that we were looking in, but actually in the road of my children's school. There was a very clear picture of the house. I emailed the agent back there and then, saying we were very interested.\" Within a couple of hours Houseago had viewed the house. \"We offered on it on the spot, and we completed the sale within four weeks.\" The obvious advantage of buying online is that you can scan a large number of properties without wearing out your shoes, but finding your way through the maze of different types of sites - with variable quality of information - can still be as daunting as driving round your chosen area trying to spot \"For Sale\" signs. The fact that two of the best-known sites launched less than two months ago illustrates how new the market still is - just as the differences between them neatly sum up its diversity. Rightmove.co.uk, which launched at the beginning of March, is a collaboration between housing giants Halifax, Countrywide Assured, Royal &amp; Sun Alliance and Cornells, pooling the properties on each of their books in one site. Now one of the largest UK property sites with 120,000 properties, Rightmove's start-up indicates the importance the big estate agents now attach to online searches. Buyers can look at lots of houses online, but after that the selling process continues just as it would have if you'd spotted the house in an estate agents' window. The launch of easier.co.uk just two weeks earlier, however, was a genuine internet innovation. Working on the principle that estate agents are nothing more than information exchanges - putting potential buyers in contact with would-be sellers - easier.co.uk dispenses with their services altogether by letting purchasers and vendors talk to each other directly. There is no fee to search for a property and the vendor pays no commission on the sale, allowing the company to claim that it manages the entire process \"faster, cheaper and better\" than traditional estate agents. \"We wanted to create a market that was fair to both buyers and sellers,\" says Easier's founder and joint chief executive, Steve Rist. \"We don't work on the basis of sales, and we don't take success-linked fees, so we are a disinterested party in terms of the transaction.\" Putting aside the forgivable spin, Rist may prove to have a point when he claims to be about to alter the housing market. The arrival of Easier on the scene, he says, is comparable with the influence of telephone broker Direct Line on the insurance broking market. When one company proved it was possible to offer cover more cheaply and conveniently established brokers hurriedly developed their service in line with heightened customer expectations. The fact that an Easier sale on a \u00a3200,000 property would save \u00a33,000-\u00a34,000 on agent's commission makes the site an attractive prospect to vendors, and estate agents are likely to be watching the site's progress nervously. But Hugh Dunsmore-Hardy, chief executive of the national association of estate agents, scoffs at the notion that net technology threatens the high street estate agent. \"There's a lot of hype over the internet. It's a way of communicating with people en masse, and it brings tremendous opportunities. But it's only a tool for communication. It doesn't replace the personal skills that an agent is bringing to the sale. \"There are many facets of buying that the internet will not replace,\" he says. \"Most busy people like to instruct agents, to let them show the house, and let the agents who are trained negotiators to actually negotiate on their behalf.\" But with sites such as Easier offering valuation, key-holding and conveyancing services, estate agents will be forced to develop their services in order to stay competitive. \"We will see estate agents taking control into their own hands with big joint sites,\" says Rist. \"We'll see commissions slashed. In this day and age, unless you can provide really good value and customer service, you're not going to be around for much longer.\" Online estate agents www.winkworth.co.uk How does it work? Houses are selected online - some can be viewed in 360 degrees - and would-be buyers then email the relevant office of the agent direct. The process then continues like a normal sale. How do they make money? The estate agent charges commission at 1.5-2% on the sale, whether sold online or through a shop window. Advantages: More convenient than trekking around the company's 37 London offices. Disadvantages: Individual agents' offices may be slow to update sites. Limited number of properties in any given area. www.rightmove.co.uk How does it work? Collaboration between several estate agents, in this case Halifax, Countrywide Assured, Royal &amp; Sun Alliance and Connells. Buyers view properties online, after which the relevant agent is contacted direct to take over on the sale process. How do they make money? Commission on each sale. Advantages: More properties than by maintaining individual sites. Disadvantages: Critics argue that it is not in agents' interests to immediately remove sold properties, as this allows them to claim a larger number of houses on their books. www.08004homes.com How does it work? A private site (not linked directly to an estate agency) that lists properties for sale from a variety of individual estate agencies. How do they make money? There are banner ads on the site, so the number of site hits is important. Advantages: Large number of properties - 08004homes.com claims 75,000 - and not limited to a few agencies. Disadvantages: Coverage may not be comprehensive - the site lists only houses that it has become aware of. www.easier.co.uk How does it work? Puts buyers and sellers in direct contact with each other, cutting out the need for an agent. Details of would-be buyers are given to vendors, who then arrange to show the house themselves or contract Easier to do it for them. How do they make money? No commission on the sale or fee, and no banner ads on the site. Easier charges for recommending mortgage companies, surveyors and independent valuers to customers. Advantages: As you don't pay commission, Easier claims to save vendors up to \u00a36,000 in estate agents' fees. As site hits are unimportant, you only need to register once and the site will email or fax you with relevant properties. Disadvantages: Likely to have a much smaller number of properties (Easier is cagey about how many, claiming only \"many thousands\"), and geographical coverage may be patchy.",

      "trailText": "<p>Feelings are running high in the e-world over the RIP - regulation of investigatory powers - bill. Here,  Peter Sommer gives the background to a debate  between two of the leading protagonists</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>To law enforcement officers it's a simple matter of retaining existing powers of surveillance under warrant as correspondence goes digital and encrypted. As many cyber-libertarians see it, the plods and spooks want easy, under-supervised access to any private activity anywhere anytime. Businesses - and not just internet service providers (ISPs) and e-commerce outfits - are becoming seriously alarmed about the cost of additional equipment and the administrative impact on their staff. </p> <p>Britain is in danger of having one of the least enabling regimes in the world as Home Office attempts at \"balanced\" legislation too often favour the needs of plod/spook over those of citizens and business. Ireland, France, Germany, even Singapore and other countries to which many UK e-businesses could easily migrate, appear to be taking a much more liberal line. </p> <p>The regulation of investigatory powers (RIP) legislation is yet another Home Office bill in trouble. Few quarrel with its aims: to bring into a single law the disparate regimes for the interception of telephone traffic, use of bugs and opening of letters, as well as defining circumstances to compel decoding of encrypted data. </p> <p>But assessment of \"balance\" needs detailed knowledge - not widely available among politicians - of datacomms, e-commerce and crypto protocols, and the practicalities of surveillance. And the result must comply with human rights and data protection laws. The outcome has to be turned into precise wordings that can be applied by warrant-issuers and the courts. </p> <p>Finally, since so much of the enforcement depends on the co-operation of private sector communications service providers (CSPs) - including telephone companies and ISPs - the laws and associated codes of practice have to become part of a manageable, affordable regime. That's the trick the RIP bill must pull off. </p> <p>The 1985 telephone tapping provisions (in the Interception of Communications Act) assume voice traffic only and BT as the main significant operator; RIP recognises new realities. There are now more than 150 telco operators, land and cellular, and even more acting as ISPs. It properly includes data, and covers private as well as public systems. CSPs have to make \"reasonable\" provision to facilitate warrants and to do so without alerting suspects; but as suspects may have several phone numbers and multiple email accounts, will telcos and ISPs have to prepare for one interception per 16,000 lines (the current figure for telephones) or one in 500 (as touted by the Internet Service Providers Association)? </p> <p> It's unclear how far the government will fund this. Even here, Home Office rhetoric that it doesn't want new powers but simply to maintain existing capability runs into difficulty: a single telephone conversation is easy to identify and isolate; not so data traffic where many simultaneous emails, world wide web requests and file transfers all occupy the same pipe and look pretty similar as data packets. How do we stop the intercept from exceeding the intended scope of a warrant? </p> <p>It's in relation to encrypted data that many of the problems lie. The first situation is stored data that is seized under warrant in a raid and which once decrypted might become evidence. RIP makes it an offence not to provide plain text or a key - but who does the asking and how does a court assess if a key has been genuinely rather than conveniently lost? And on whom does the burden of proof lie? </p> <p>It is much more difficult where there is a warrant for covert interception of data in transmission which turns out to be encrypted. Here the recipient of a decryption demand will be an innocent third party. He or she may have severe contractual and data protection obligations to other users of the same crypto system but faces criminal sanctions both for non-compliance with a RIP demand and for any action which might lead to a suspect being tipped off. And if legitimate users of the crypto system suffer because of law enforcement clumsiness, what remedies do they have? </p> <p>One needs to look at the whole mechanism of RIP to see the extent of the difficulties: different types of activity give rise to a variety of warrants and demands, some issued by judicial figures, most by ministers, some simply by policemen. The range of bodies that can ask for (but not always issue) warrants extends as far as the inland revenue and the benefits agency. </p> <p>Criteria are sometimes \"for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime\" and \"safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom\" (in clause 5) but elsewhere \"for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime\" and \"in the interests of economic well-being of the UK\" (clause 21 - on traffic data). </p> <p>MPs in the standing committee reviewing the bill have complained about the proliferation of oversight tribunals and commissioners with varying powers and to whom the private citizen has variable rights of access as well as to information about suspected intercepts that might make such application meaningful. Ministers have justified the complexity by saying that the right balance has to be struck for many different circumstances. </p> <p>MPs have also been concerned that some RIP provisions offer a covert means for the security service, secret intelligence service and GCHQ to extend their territo ries into traditional police and customs territory. </p> <p>It is possible to guess why the RIP bill has taken this form: the scenario builders at NCIS, Cheltenham and the Thames-side fortresses read the same internet scare stories as the rest of us. They make projections about the powers they might need, partly to increase their influence but also because they fear they may not get another slot in a very crowded legislative calendar. And ministers lack knowledge to challenge their threat assessments. </p> <p> Peter Sommer is a research fellow at the LSE, special advisor to the commons trade and industry select committee and has been an expert witness in \"computer crime\" trials for 15 years. </p> <p><strong> \"It will wreck our e-commerce hopes for the UK.\" Caspar Bowden, director of the Foundation for Information Policy Research, opens the debate on the RIP bill</strong> <br> The new economy means we need an updated and revised framework for the legal interception of communications. But the proposed regulation of investigatory powers (RIP) bill won't make Britain a better place to live, and it'll wreck our hopes to create in the UK the world's best environment for e-commerce. </p> <p>RIP proposes powers to demand, even from an innocent person or business, the electronic keys that will unlock not just one or two messages, but perhaps all one's traffic to date. Though earlier attempts to legislate to secure copies of decryption keys have failed, and though other countries have turned their backs on the idea, the British government is still trying to secure a general right of access to them for a wide range of state authori ties, and for loosely defined purposes. Furthermore, at the government's whim, you cannot tell anyone, even your wife or your boss, that this has happened. </p> <p>This is intrusive for individuals. Business is slowly waking up to the enormity of these proposals, which have no parallel anywhere in the world. </p> <p>From this seriously flawed start, the RIP proposals degenerate. They seem to have been devised by redeployed cold warriors who want to put Britain on a paranoid infowar footing. Meanwhile the rest of the e-world plans a prosperous future based on trust in robust security without unwarranted interference. </p> <p>Do you still have every key, password, PIN number, cash card you have ever owned? Do you ever lose computer files by mistake? Under RIP, if you don't have your decryption key any more, you're liable to two years in jail unless you can prove to a court, on balance of probability, that the key was lost or destroyed. </p> <p>I can commend home office minister Charles Clarke for now joining the debate, and his boss Jack Straw for conceding in the house that there is room for improvement in the bill, but we first pointed out these problems to the government two years ago. </p> <p>Mr Clarke recently said in a letter to this newspaper, \"We believe that we've struck the balance right\", and that \"innocent people are not going to suffer under these proposals.\" Ministers come and go, but the legislation they leave defines our rights and freedoms. There is nothing in RIP that stops these powers being used arbitrarily. </p> <p>Although we've proposed many amendments, the RIP bill cannot be patched up. It must be withdrawn and rewritten. Law enforcement's task is not helped by unenforceable laws: we need, instead, a law that suits an aspiring e-commerce leader. </p> <p> <strong> \"The bill does not outlaw any form of encryption.\" <br> Charles Clarke, home office minister, replies: </strong> <br> I welcome a constructive dialogue on the RIP bill. I agree that we need to update law enforcement powers for the digital age. Not surprisingly though, I do not hold with your other assertions about the government's proposals. </p> <p>The bill is about ensuring, as best we can, that powers crucial to keeping this country a safe place for everyone to live and work remain effective in the face of technological advancement. Some of these powers, interception of communications for example, are particularly intrusive. That's precisely why they should, as the bill proposes, be closely regulated. </p> <p>This is a difficult area. New technologies, the growth of the global knowledge economy (and our desire to be a leader in it) and the penchant of criminals to exploit whatever new ways they can to evade detection throw up new challenges. Encryption raises difficult, some might say unique, problems. But we would be putting our heads in the sand if we didn't tackle them. </p> <p>The bill does not outlaw any particular encryption technology or mandate the use of any particular key management system. Individuals and businesses alike remain free to use whatever technology best suits their needs. What the bill does is provide a power, where there are reasonable grounds to believe that a person has a key to unlock particular encrypted material, to require the disclosure of that key or the data itself in an intelligible form. The power only applies to lawfully obtained material. And if you've lost or forgotten a key then there is a statutory defence for you. </p> <p>Neither of us wants to see criminals being able to use the latest technologies with impunity. You want to see an individual's rights upheld. So do I. You don't want to see business encumbered by unreasonable burdens or draconian laws. Neither do I. This is all about a balance and I believe that the bill strikes the right one. </p> <p>The bill will not be withdrawn. There is cross party support for the thrust of what is being proposed. But as you (almost correctly) point out, the home secretary has said that he hasn't yet introduced a bill that has not benefited from careful parliamentary scrutiny. </p> <p>The RIP bill is important and it deserves such examination. And that's just what is happening. We're going through the proposals in committee now, clause by clause. </p> <p> <strong> Mr Bowden replies:</strong> <br> The RIP bill is about what it says, not necessarily what you say it is about. There's nothing criminal about using encryption, but RIP treats everyone as suspect. Bad memory - maybe two years in jail will help? </p> <p>As we use more websites, email, digital TV, and smartcards to live more of our lives through cyberspace, use of encryption is essential to stop fraud, blackmail, identity theft, and just to preserve a little privacy. But most people don't even realise they are using encryption when they make up a password. You can't bully people into recording every one as if their liberty depended on it. In the real world, 10% of ordinary computer users lose data by forgetting keys - passing a law won't change that. </p> <p>You assume everyone prosecuted will be a villain, refuse to say how they can prove they are not guilty, and then assure us that the innocent will not suffer! That's not the job of a politician. We have a judiciary to sort out the innocent from the guilty, on the basis of evidence. </p> <p>The trouble with your \"statutory defence\" is that there is no evidence when someone forgets something, so criminals with a lot to hide will always plead a bad memory. </p> <p>The jury or magistrate (if mode of trial goes through, people won't have the choice) will simply have to guess whether the defendant is lying. RIP requires no evidence (46.2.b.2) of an underlying (let alone serious - 46.3.b) crime in order for decryption to be demanded. So here are four questions about RIP Part.III that we've been asking for a while: </p> <p><strong> 1)</strong> How can a person who loses a password reliably prove their innocence \"on the balance of probabilities\"? </p> <p><strong> 2)</strong> The handling centre for keys in the MI5 building may be secure, but what about keys in transit? MI5 lost a laptop the other day, and an encrypting modem disappeared from No.10 in 1998. How much is guarding seized keys really going to cost? </p> <p><strong> 3)</strong> Won't RIP encourage \"steganography\" (or information hiding), which will exacerbate law enforcement's problems ? </p> <p><strong> 4)</strong> It's true RIP doesn't insist that companies lodge spare keys with \"trusted\" third-parties anymore, but you are making company directors liable to imprisonment (S.69) if they cannot comply with a decryption order. Isn't this \"key-escrow by intimidation\"? </p> <p>I am sorry that you have closed your mind to the possibility that this part of the bill is misconceived. But the opposition parties have clearly signalled that they will withdraw support if their serious concerns on these and other matters are not met. </p> <p>There are a hundred amendments tabled before decryption is due to be considered. Will you allow the committee to take its time? </p> <p> <strong> Mr Clarke replies:</strong> <br> The committee is scrutinising the bill carefully. And it will continue to do so. As you assert, it's important to see what the legislation actually says. </p> <p>Innocent people are not going to be imprisoned for having a bad memory. Remember a vital point. The bill does not allow the authorities to get their hands on material which they cannot do now. </p> <p>The new power only works where material is lawfully obtained. If it is encrypted, and someone who is in a position to decode it refuses to do so, only then does the question of a prosecution arise. Where prosecutions occur, the authorities have to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that a person has, or has had, a key. </p> <p>How do you demonstrate that you've lost or forgotten a key? You explain what has happened and the court will decide whether, on balance, you're telling the truth. </p> <p>There are statutory defences if you hand over as much information as you can. If you've forgotten your key, you might explain how it was generated, when you last used it and what you normally do if you forget it. Your earlier analogy of losing a PIN is inappropriate. I can't think of an occasion when a bank would be unable to provide details of an account when required to do so under existing powers. This isn't escrow by intimidation. </p> <p>The cost of establishing the technical facility which will handle keys obtained under the bill will be met from the money the chancellor has provided for tackling crime in the capital modernisation fund. Deploying the highest level of security for such keys is a top priority. Will criminals turn to other forms of information hiding post-RIP? We cannot tell what the future holds by way of other technologies that may or may not be taken up by criminals. Experience tells us that they will use what most readily suits their needs. </p> <p>The implication that the bill treats encryption users as suspect is wide of the mark. We know the technology is good for e-business, individuals' privacy and helps prevent certain crimes. It's also important to our e-government agenda. The bill does not criminalise the use of encryption. It targets the criminals, such as paedophiles, who use it to conceal their insidious activities. </p> <p> <strong> Mr Bowden:</strong> <br> RIP doesn't target anyone at all - it's a blunderbuss which an extreme government could abuse for its own purposes. It's a pity that once again you seek to justify an unworkable encryption policy by associating it with an abominable crime. </p> <p>Child pornographers should be severely punished and deterred, but a responsible government would begin to give law enforcement the training and resources to defeat encryption when necessary through technical surveillance devices, and put in place an oversight framework with teeth to see that these powerful new capabilities can never be abused. The course on which your officials have ill-advisedly committed you will enmesh us further in a culture of secrecy, which will corrode our democracy long after you have left office and anodyne reassurances have been long forgotten. A law which replaces the presumption of innocence with a medieval trial-by-ordeal is simply wrong, not \"a question of balance\". </p> <p> <strong> Mr Clarke:</strong> <br> The RIP powers are necessary. But we've never said that they represent a panacea for all law enforcement's ills. We know that simplistic answers no longer work in today's fast changing technological environment. </p> <p>Last year's joint government/ industry task force on encryption and law enforcement recommended that a package of measures is needed if we are to have any hope of addressing effectively the threat posed by the criminal use of encryption. </p> <p>We're putting that package in place. Providing new powers, specifically recommended by the task force, forms an integral part of our approach. </p> <p>They require authorisation and are subject to independent oversight. But we're also providing law enforcement with a dedicated resource to assist over encryption and forging a new co-operative relationship with industry. </p> <p>These too are vital elements of the package, on which I place great store. This isn't about \"corroding\" democracy. It's about helping keep society safe. </p> <p><strong> Web addresses</strong></p> <p>Home Office RIP Bill<br><a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/oicd/ripbill.htm\">Home Office RIP bill</a> </p> <p>Consultation paper <br><a href=\"http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/oicd/ioc.htm\">Home Office consultation paper</a></p> <p>House of Commons library research paper on RIP <br><a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/rp2000/rp00-025.pdf\">House of Commons research paper</a> </p> <p>Report from the Cabinet Office, Encryption and Law Enforcement, May 1999 <br><a href=\"http://www.fipr.org/polarch/piu.pdf\">Cabinet Office report</a> </p> <p>National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS): Project Trawler report, June 1999 <a href=\"http://www.ncis.co.uk/newpage1.htm\">NCIS report</a> </p> <p>Foundation for Information Policy Research: RIP Bill Information Centre <br><a href=\"http://www.fipr.org/rip/index.html\">www.fipr.org/rip/index.html </a></p> <p> Campaign against RIP bill: <br> <a href=\"http://www.stand.org.uk\">www.stand.org.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "To law enforcement officers it's a simple matter of retaining existing powers of surveillance under warrant as correspondence goes digital and encrypted. As many cyber-libertarians see it, the plods and spooks want easy, under-supervised access to any private activity anywhere anytime. Businesses - and not just internet service providers (ISPs) and e-commerce outfits - are becoming seriously alarmed about the cost of additional equipment and the administrative impact on their staff. Britain is in danger of having one of the least enabling regimes in the world as Home Office attempts at \"balanced\" legislation too often favour the needs of plod/spook over those of citizens and business. Ireland, France, Germany, even Singapore and other countries to which many UK e-businesses could easily migrate, appear to be taking a much more liberal line. The regulation of investigatory powers (RIP) legislation is yet another Home Office bill in trouble. Few quarrel with its aims: to bring into a single law the disparate regimes for the interception of telephone traffic, use of bugs and opening of letters, as well as defining circumstances to compel decoding of encrypted data. But assessment of \"balance\" needs detailed knowledge - not widely available among politicians - of datacomms, e-commerce and crypto protocols, and the practicalities of surveillance. And the result must comply with human rights and data protection laws. The outcome has to be turned into precise wordings that can be applied by warrant-issuers and the courts. Finally, since so much of the enforcement depends on the co-operation of private sector communications service providers (CSPs) - including telephone companies and ISPs - the laws and associated codes of practice have to become part of a manageable, affordable regime. That's the trick the RIP bill must pull off. The 1985 telephone tapping provisions (in the Interception of Communications Act) assume voice traffic only and BT as the main significant operator; RIP recognises new realities. There are now more than 150 telco operators, land and cellular, and even more acting as ISPs. It properly includes data, and covers private as well as public systems. CSPs have to make \"reasonable\" provision to facilitate warrants and to do so without alerting suspects; but as suspects may have several phone numbers and multiple email accounts, will telcos and ISPs have to prepare for one interception per 16,000 lines (the current figure for telephones) or one in 500 (as touted by the Internet Service Providers Association)? It's unclear how far the government will fund this. Even here, Home Office rhetoric that it doesn't want new powers but simply to maintain existing capability runs into difficulty: a single telephone conversation is easy to identify and isolate; not so data traffic where many simultaneous emails, world wide web requests and file transfers all occupy the same pipe and look pretty similar as data packets. How do we stop the intercept from exceeding the intended scope of a warrant? It's in relation to encrypted data that many of the problems lie. The first situation is stored data that is seized under warrant in a raid and which once decrypted might become evidence. RIP makes it an offence not to provide plain text or a key - but who does the asking and how does a court assess if a key has been genuinely rather than conveniently lost? And on whom does the burden of proof lie? It is much more difficult where there is a warrant for covert interception of data in transmission which turns out to be encrypted. Here the recipient of a decryption demand will be an innocent third party. He or she may have severe contractual and data protection obligations to other users of the same crypto system but faces criminal sanctions both for non-compliance with a RIP demand and for any action which might lead to a suspect being tipped off. And if legitimate users of the crypto system suffer because of law enforcement clumsiness, what remedies do they have? One needs to look at the whole mechanism of RIP to see the extent of the difficulties: different types of activity give rise to a variety of warrants and demands, some issued by judicial figures, most by ministers, some simply by policemen. The range of bodies that can ask for (but not always issue) warrants extends as far as the inland revenue and the benefits agency. Criteria are sometimes \"for the purpose of preventing or detecting serious crime\" and \"safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom\" (in clause 5) but elsewhere \"for the purposes of preventing or detecting crime\" and \"in the interests of economic well-being of the UK\" (clause 21 - on traffic data). MPs in the standing committee reviewing the bill have complained about the proliferation of oversight tribunals and commissioners with varying powers and to whom the private citizen has variable rights of access as well as to information about suspected intercepts that might make such application meaningful. Ministers have justified the complexity by saying that the right balance has to be struck for many different circumstances. MPs have also been concerned that some RIP provisions offer a covert means for the security service, secret intelligence service and GCHQ to extend their territo ries into traditional police and customs territory. It is possible to guess why the RIP bill has taken this form: the scenario builders at NCIS, Cheltenham and the Thames-side fortresses read the same internet scare stories as the rest of us. They make projections about the powers they might need, partly to increase their influence but also because they fear they may not get another slot in a very crowded legislative calendar.

      "body": "<p>Although I haven't checked with his newspaper shop down in Somerset, I think it can be said with some confidence that the novelist Anthony Powell, who died on Tuesday at the age of 94, was not a Guardian reader. Nor was his 12- volume sequence, A Dance to the Music of Time, to the taste of many Guardian readers. They tend to share the view of the young novelist Diran Adebayo who, interviewed on the Today programme, dismissed the books as a kind of upper-class soap opera, a tedious account of a rarefied group of people whose adventures have little or nothing to do with the everyday lives of the multitude. There are very few folk in the novels of Anthony Powell who you'd ever meet shopping in Tesco. And this, it is often asserted, is because Powell was an upper-class snob; a charge, it has to be said, which those who have read his journals could scarcely dispute. </p> <p>These complaints, though, need to be disentangled. That Powell was an upper-class snob does not mean that his books confine themselves to a world of upper-class snobbery. (Adebayo, to his credit, frankly admitted during his interview to not having read them). There are plenty of justified charges against The Music of Time. For a start, it depends to a quite alarming degree on coincidence: people bump into each other on trains or in dark wartime London squares with a serendipitous frequency which simply does not occur in real life. And though Powell has a reputation as a stylist, there are times, in the later books especially, when the prose descends into jowl- quivering orotundity. \"The gift of authority, the ability to handle people\", he writes of a sinister new age prophet called Scorpio Murtlock in the last of these books, Hearing Secret Harmonies, \"was the characteristic attributed by hearsay. At first, the outward trappings, suggesting no more than a contemporary romantic vagabondage, had put that reputation in doubt. Now one saw the truth of some at least of what had been reported of him; that the vagabond style could include ability to control companions - notably Fiona - as well as crayfish and horses...\" And so on. It's close to unbearable. </p> <p>Yet none of that, in the end, really matters. All his faults are redeemed by the richness of the creations whose stumbling journeys through life he charts. In a curious way, I think Powell has paid a price for inventing Kenneth Widmerpool who, from his first appearance, solemn and spectacled, chugging out of the mist of an Eton afternoon in A Question of Upbringing, to his wretched death at the hands of Murtlock, dominates these proceedings. </p> <p> Yesterday Powell's friend Hilary Spurling rated Widmerpool alongside Falstaff and Captain Hook as a great monument bestowed on the nation. \"Genius of author who gave us Widmerpool\" one newspaper tribute was headlined. But the more you read of these books, the more other creations begin to haunt you. Hugh Moreland, the one I like most - a gentle, sweet-natured melancholy composer, with talent, but not quite enough, unlucky in love, and addicted to drink on a scale which evokes Constant Lambert. The music critic Maclintick, with his termagant wife and his book which will never be finished, who in a moment of drunken despair throws his cherished text down the lavatory and then gasses himself. The wild, capricious, serially irresistible Pamela Flitton, who leaves trails of ruined men behind her wherever she goes. The eccentric left-wing peer Alfie Erridge, with his glowering dipsomaniac butler, straight out of Charles Addams. The Marxist poet and critic, JG Quiggin... Though none of these has become as much part of the language as Widmerpool, Powell makes them so real that one pines for them when they have gone. </p> <p>Most of this group belong to the 1930s, a time full of hectic parties and the apprehension of war. These are the parts of the sequence I always liked best. Thereafter the mood seems to darken. The final books of the sequence grow odd, disturbing and ugly. There have been figures whose political views and social attitudes make one squirm, but now new characters appear, like the American academic Russell Gwinnett, with his weird sexual proclivities, whose presence is hard to endure. Even Pamela Flitton fails to survive her encounter with him. </p> <p>Hilary Spurling, who knows these books better than anyone else, says the central themes of the sequence are old age, madness and death, a judgment which may not help Powell's posthumous sales at Waterstone's. I'm not sure this is wholly true. For most of the sequence, they are just as much about the arbitrary oddness of life, the way friends are lost and recovered; the way some remain exactly the same while others change bit by bit till you find one day that you hardly know them; the way people of no conspicuous talent advance and prosper, while others of flaring brilliance end up defeated and broken. Though they may have been written by an upper-class snob whose view of the Guardian I tremble to contemplate, these books can make you re-examine your life, and find new patterns there, some troubling, some consoling.

The Chinese police regularly uncover organised rackets that offer country girls jobs in the cities only to force them into prostitution or to sell them to prospective husbands. Children are also targeted: in a recent reported case in southern Guangdong province, young boys kidnapped from the other end of the country were sent out every day to pick pockets - and beaten viciously if they failed to meet quotas. Cases of trafficking in women and children are reportedly on the rise in China. Its national anti-abduction campaign coincides with an international conference that opened yesterday in Manila to find ways of ending the \"modern-day slavery\" of Asian women and children. The conference was told that trafficking in human beings is now the third-largest source of money for organised crime in Asia, after drugs and guns. Tens of thousands of women and children are kidnapped every year in China; more than 2,000 cases of kidnapping have been recently reported in the province of Hubei alone. Women are frequently sold as wives to peasants who cannot afford the cost of a traditional wedding. Elsewhere, children kidnapped from the far-west region of Xinjiang have been found in the southern city of Jiangmen working as pickpockets. Jiangmen police recently a ring of 15 boys working for 12 kidnappers who sent them out with a daily quota of money to steal. National centres equipped for genetic testing have been set up to verify parentage after the discovery of more than 30 kidnapped children in central Guizhou province received national publicity earlier this year and led to more than 400 alleged \"parents\" coming forward.

      "body": "<p>The ruckus over <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Houston,+Whitney\">Whitney Houston</a>'s last minute Oscar exit shows few signs of abating. Did she jump or was she pushed? And does the controversy hint at wider problems in the singer's life and career?</p> <p>Houston was booked to sing in the medley at Sunday night's Academy Awards only to withdraw after the initial rehearsals. Houston claims it was because she was suffering from a tickly throat. A statement from Arista records claims that \"Whitney Houston arrived in Los Angeles with a sore throat. After participating in rehearsals, both Thursday and Friday nights, she was unsure she would be better by Sunday. She therefore regretfully withdrew from the performance.\"</p> <p>But this official explanation does not tally with the views of others within the auditorium, who allege that Houston was effectively fired by the Academy's musical directors Burt Baccharach and Don Was. The New York Post quotes a source close to the production who claims that Houston only rehearsed on Thursday night, under duress and for fifteen minutes only. Houston, says the source, was \"totally out of it\" and \"discombobulated. She came in on cue for one number but missed her cue for the second and sang the wrong song.\" Afterwards, Baccharach apparently told her: \"Just leave. It's not going to work out.\"</p> <p>This latest Houston fiasco comes barely a month after she was arrested by Hawaiian customs under suspicion of possessing a sizeable quantity of marijuana. Houston, it is alleged, gave officials the slip and boarded a plane back to the US mainland before Hawaiian police could arrive at the airport. She is currently awaiting charges which, if successful, could result in a thirty day jail sentence. Inevitably, Hollywood is rife with rumours that the singer is showing signs of coming apart at the seams.</p> <p>Meantime, back at Oscar camp, Houston's \"withdrawal\" led the event's panicking organisers to draft in country singer Faith Hill, at a cost of a $60,000 private jet flight.

      "bodyText": "The ruckus over Whitney Houston's last minute Oscar exit shows few signs of abating. Did she jump or was she pushed? And does the controversy hint at wider problems in the singer's life and career? Houston was booked to sing in the medley at Sunday night's Academy Awards only to withdraw after the initial rehearsals. Houston claims it was because she was suffering from a tickly throat. A statement from Arista records claims that \"Whitney Houston arrived in Los Angeles with a sore throat. After participating in rehearsals, both Thursday and Friday nights, she was unsure she would be better by Sunday. She therefore regretfully withdrew from the performance.\" But this official explanation does not tally with the views of others within the auditorium, who allege that Houston was effectively fired by the Academy's musical directors Burt Baccharach and Don Was. The New York Post quotes a source close to the production who claims that Houston only rehearsed on Thursday night, under duress and for fifteen minutes only. Houston, says the source, was \"totally out of it\" and \"discombobulated. She came in on cue for one number but missed her cue for the second and sang the wrong song.\" Afterwards, Baccharach apparently told her: \"Just leave. It's not going to work out.\" This latest Houston fiasco comes barely a month after she was arrested by Hawaiian customs under suspicion of possessing a sizeable quantity of marijuana. Houston, it is alleged, gave officials the slip and boarded a plane back to the US mainland before Hawaiian police could arrive at the airport. She is currently awaiting charges which, if successful, could result in a thirty day jail sentence. Inevitably, Hollywood is rife with rumours that the singer is showing signs of coming apart at the seams. Meantime, back at Oscar camp, Houston's \"withdrawal\" led the event's panicking organisers to draft in country singer Faith Hill, at a cost of a $60,000 private jet flight. This, in turn, allegedly gave rise to a major hissy-fit from Garth Brooks, who had been assured that he would be the only country-western singer in the Oscar night medley and was determined not to have his thunder stolen. Brooks is rumoured to have wept with rage at the turn of events, though supporters have claimed that he was only crying over the absence of his dear friend Whitney. Phew - and it all looked so serene on the surface, didn't it?",

In contrived circumstances at Christchurch in 1989-90 the future New Zealand captain Lee Germon actually hit eight sixes in one over from Wellington's Bert Vance, but he was bowling deliberate no-balls (the over lasted for 22 deliveries) to encourage the batsmen to attack a target. It was a farcical situation: the scoreboard attendants couldn't keep up, while the umpires lost track of the number of legitimate balls bowled, and called 'over' after only five non-no-balls. The match eventually finished as a draw with the scores level. </p> <p> <strong>If a bowler takes wickets with the last two balls of a Test series and then with the first ball he bowls in another series, is it a hat-trick?</strong> asks Vishwas Garg</p> <p>By convention it's only a hat-trick if three wickets come from successive balls in the same match. So you can split a hat-trick over two innings in the same match - something which didn't happen in Test cricket until Courtney Walsh did it in the 1110th match, for West Indies v Australia at Brisbane in 1988-89. Amazingly it happened again in the very next Test, when Merv Hughes's hat-trick against West Indies actually came from three different overs - the last ball of one and the first ball of his next to end the first innings, and this first ball in the second innings.</p> <p> <strong>We've been stumped by a question in our local church quiz - can you help? How far is the popping crease from the wicket?</strong> ask Paula &amp; Mike Robinson</p> <p>According to Law 9, the back edge of the popping crease (the line in front of the stumps which the batsman usually stands on or near) should be four feet from the centre of the stumps.</p> <p> <strong>Who's missing from this England team, which played West Indies at Headingley in 1976? Woolmer, Steele, Balderstone, Willey, Greig, Knott, Snow, Underwood, Ward, Willis? </strong> asks Gwyn Gould</p> <p>The missing man is Frank Hayes, the Lancashire basman, who was playing the last of his nine Tests. Rather unluckily for him all nine of them came against West Indies, starting in 1973 when he scored 106 not out on his debut at The Oval. Hayes is now the master in charge of cricket at Felsted School in Essex, a famous nursery that produced Derek Pringle and John Stephenson, among others.</p> <p> <strong>I'm a big Lancashire and Wisden fan.

So you're more likely to spot 'Winker' strutting his stuff in the 2nd XI this season. </p> <p> <strong>With Willie Watson's recent 80th birthday in mind I was wondering if any other countries had such distinguished double internationals. I know that New Zealand have had the likes of Brian McKechnie and Jeff Wilson at cricket/rugby, but have the Australians ever had such a sportsman?</strong> asks Sarah Bailey</p> <p>Australia has had three double cricket-rugby internationals: Sammy Woods (who actually played cricket for England as well, in the 19th century), Johnny Taylor and Otto Nothling. The last two played both sports in the 1920s. More recently Brian Booth, who captained Australia in two Tests in 1965-66, also played hockey for them at the Olympics. But Australia's most famous allround sportsman is probably Reginald 'Snowy' Baker (1884-1953), who excelled at more than 20 sports, most famously swimming and boxing, in both of which he participated at the Olympic Games in London in 1908. He won a silver medal in the boxing, at middleweight - beaten by another sporting allrounder in Johnny Douglas, who went on to captain England at cricket. Baker later made a name as an actor in Hollywood. </p> <p> <strong>Has anybody ever been given out 'obstructing the field' in Tests or one-dayers?</strong> asks Kannan Tirupachanur</p> <p>The only man to be given out this way in Tests was Len Hutton, of England, at The Oval in 1951. He top-edged a sweep at Athol Rowan, the South African offspinner, and the ball looped upwards. Worried that the ball would bounce onto his stumps, Hutton knocked it away, but in doing so prevented Russell Endean, the wicketkeeper, from making a catch, and was given out on appeal. Oddly enough Endean was involved in Test cricket's next curious dismissal: he was out 'handled the ball' at Cape Town in 1956-57. </p> <p>Two batsmen have been given out 'obstructing the field' in one-day internationals: Ramiz Raja (Pakistan v England, Karachi, 1987-88) and Mohinder Amarnath (India v Sri Lanka, Ahmedabad, 1989-90). </p> <p> <strong>Exiled in America, I lost touch with cricket for some years, until I picked up on it again recently via the internet. In the meantime, something called reverse-swing seems to have been invented. What is it?</strong> asks Frazer Ward from New York</p> <p>Reverse-swing - or 'Irish swing' as the Australians like to call it - tends to happen late in an innings, when the ball begins to swing in the opposite direction to that expected. This phenomenon is achieved by keeping one side of the ball very dry (and occasionally making the other side very wet) or by ignoring scuffmarks and gouges on one side of the ball and highly polishing the other. Rumour has it that bottle-tops and nails were occasionally used to hasten the deterioration. Reverse-swing only seems to work for fast bowlers using an oldish ball (usually 30-40 overs old). For a history of reverse-swing, see <a href=\"http://www.cricketunlimited.co.uk/Articles/0,5217,153748,00.html\"> Scyld Berry's essay </a> in the February edition of Wisden Cricket Monthly. </p> <p> <strong>When are England next touring Australia?</strong> asks G Raben The next Test tour is scheduled for 2002-03, which will be 16 years after England last won a series there (1986-87).

By the 1950s Ray Lindwall was combining in- and outswing at will and at pace. </p> <p> Now we have reverse-swing to perplex batsmen and spectators alike. Just as physicists were starting to account for conventional swing with some conviction, along comes reverse-swing to be more inexplicable still. But if its causes are uncertain, its effects are not. The evolution of reverse-swing, along with the revival of wrist-spin, has stopped tailenders hanging around and brought about a higher proportion of definite conclusions in Test cricket - often in three or four days - than in the 1960s and '70s.</p> <p> And if reverse-swing is not an inexact science, it doesn't have an exact history either, as it has always tended to be a cloak-and-dagger subject, inextricably associated with ball-tampering. But it has evolved in the same way that all other bowling techniques have evolved. As soon as cricket becomes too much of a batsman's game, bowlers devise a new form of attack to rectify the balance; at which point the game's administrators (almost invariably former batsmen, if they played at all) step in to curb the bowlers by banning Bodyline or too many bouncers or uncovered pitches. Then batsmen dominate again until bowlers come up with googlies or slower balls or new forms of swing and the process continues its cyclical course.</p> <p> The first instances of reverse-swing that I've heard of date back to Pakistan in the 1940s, although no doubt the phenomenon occurred in other countries at earlier times without anyone identifying it by name. Mudassar Nazar, whose late father Nazar Mohammad also opened the batting for Pakistan, recounts that outswing bowlers in club cricket in Lahore in his father's time would come back for a second spell with the old ball and find it swinging into right-handers. A prime exponent of this phenomenon was Salim (\"Bobby\") Altaf, who played for Pakistan in the 1960s.</p> <p> In the West Indies in the 1950s something similar was going on. Eric Atkinson, who died in May 1998, was the key man here, a strong medium-pacer who bowled long spells at Kensington Oval for Barbados and West Indies and wobbled the old ball around in the sea breezes. The expert on this subject is Richard \"Prof\" Edwards, the West Indian fast bowler of the late 1960s who continued to do it long afterwards in Bajan club cricket for Wanderers. </p> <p> He still gives a fascinating lecture on reverse-swing; unfortunately, as with most lectures, when I attended Prof's in the '80s I omitted to take notes.</p> <p> The first major exponents at Test level were Sarfraz Nawaz, Imran Khan and Dennis Lillee. While in England for the World Cup, Imran recalled seeing Lillee reverse-swing into Pakistan's right-handed batsmen in a Test at Melbourne: that must have been 1976-77. From Australia Pakistan went straight on to the West Indies for one of the most entertaining five-Test series ever played. Their tour manager, the former Test allrounder Colonel Shujauddin, remembers Sarfraz and Imran rooming together and the ball starting to go round corners.</p> <p> The first time I saw reverse-swing, though I didn't know it at the time, was when Australia played a Test at Faisalabad in the autumn of 1982. Peter Sleep came in at No. 6 to face an old ball and Imran in his prime: it is a picture I can never recall without thinking of a goat being tethered as bait for a tiger. Imran charged in, leapt, and his first ball at Sleep was angled towards first or second slip before boomeranging two-thirds of the way through its flight. It then veered in towards the right-handed Sleep, pitched a full length and detonated his stumps out of the ground. Looking back (a bit like Sleep did), I realise why Imran didn't take the second new ball at Lord's in the summer of 1982 when Pakistan were desperate to finish off England's second innings (they did so just in time to win by ten wickets). The English media could not understand why Imran waited until the 117th over on a flat wicket before taking the second ball. \"Taking the new ball is such a clich\u008e,\" was all that Imran would say at the time. But now we know, a little.</p> <p> Darren Gough, by a long way, has been England's leading exponent of reverse-swing. He may be exaggerating when he says that out of his 132 wickets up until the Durban Test \"at least 40 would be reverse-swing\" - that would mean almost every bowled and lbw dismissal - but not by much. As happy a memory of England's cricket as any in the '90s will be that of Gough, armed with an old ball, making it reverse-swing into right-handers to keep or pin them on their toes.</p> <p> Gough first learnt about reverse-swing in 1992 when the Pakistanis toured England and Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis brought off some amazing displays - and England collapses - in the Tests at Lord's, Headingley and The Oval, not to mention the one-day international at Lord's when the ball was confiscated and replaced after the umpires had detected tampering, although officialdom would not confirm it. \"It was mainly just watching Waqar on the telly, his action and the way he held the ball, and facing Wasim when he was playing for Lancashire, and I was amazed how he came round the wicket and made it go away.</p> <p> \"I started bowling well for Yorkshire in 1993. When Jarvo [Paul Jarvis] were injured I came into the side in the second half of the season and started reversing then. If you want to reverse-swing it really helps if you can bowl a yorker, and I've always bowled lots of yorkers and slower balls. I've always bowled at the death for Yorkshire too [and therefore the ball has been old]. Most youngsters bowl their overs in the middle of the innings in one-day cricket, but not me.\"</p> <p> He is not alone in preferring Readers balls for the purpose. When the Pakistanis toured England, and some old-fashioned courtesy allowed them to select the make of ball if they won the toss of a coin, they wanted Readers too. \"Dukes don't 'go' so much, and they do it later,\" says Gough. The Australian Kookaburra has reversed well for him too \"at Melbourne and Sydney [where Gough took a hat-trick] and Adelaide on the last tour.\" The Kookaburra is also used at all levels in South Africa on their equally hard pitches. When Gough toured the country with England A in 1993-94, he put his new technique into practice in the \"Test\" at Port Elizabeth where \"the wicket were bald\" and he took seven wickets. A wet and grassy pitch, and lush outfield, are the conditions least likely for reverse-swing. In the Port Elizabeth Test this winter the pitch was too grassy for reversing, insufficiently abrasive.</p> <p> In Gough's experience Old Trafford is the best ground in England for reverse-swing, not so much because of the actual pitch but because the whole square has been bald in recent seasons: \"It can 'go' as early as the sixth or seventh over.\" Headingley comes next: \"About 30 overs old on a dry day.\" But Gough has done it all over the place at some time or another, from Edgbaston on his one-day international debut for England in 1994 against New Zealand to Canterbury last summer, when he took his 100th ODI wicket in the World Cup match against Kenya and started one ball outside the left-handed Mohammad Sheikh's legs and hit his off stump.</p> <p> Creating the conditions for reverse-swing can sometimes be more than a natural process. Cricket's whispered secrets include the county game when an eminent overseas player, from Pakistan, called for a bottle-opener to be brought out at a drinks interval, hacked one side of the ball with it, and wrapped up a match by reversing round corners. At Lord's in 1994 Mike Atherton dug deep (into his pocket) to get the ball to reverse, which he had seen happening to great effect in the West Indies the previous winter, notably in the hands of Kenny Benjamin. Gough laughs at the memory of Atherton's attempt: \"He basically hadn't got a clue what to do,\" and waves imaginary dirt over a ball. \"You keep one side as dry as possible and shine the other, and try to get the rest of the guys to do the same. Yorkshire are so clued in to get it right for me and Chalky [Craig White].</p> <p> \"My theory is keep the same side shiny - start with shining it for normal swing and keep that side shiny all the time. How it happens I haven't got a clue, it's just something I'm glad I can do because it gives you the ability to bowl on flat wickets and the higher you go the flatter they are. In one-day cricket especially, if you don't do something with the ball, you'll get slapped, lashed.\"</p> <p> Among England bowlers Dean Headley comes second to Gough as a reverse-swinger: he made it \"go\" beautifully in the Melbourne and Sydney Tests last winter. Among overseas bowlers, Waqar, Shoaib Akhtar and Glenn McGrath are the leading right-arm exponents. They all have an action which gets a little outswing on a new ball and a lot of reverse-swing with an old one, particularly when delivered with a slightly low arm. \"Shorter people, and fast arm,\" are the essentials according to Gough; \"The quicker you bowl the more it reverses.\" The former South African swing bowler Fanie de Villiers confirms this: \"I didn't quite have the pace to reverse it a lot.\"</p> <p> As Gough says, a well-grooved yorker helps too, not merely because it spends slightly more time in the air and can therefore swing further. The full-length ball will bring in the lbws, especially on a low pitch, as the batsman pushes half-forward; the yorker will go further and hit those stumps, all the more so if a new batsman has come to the crease. Gough's hat-tricks have usually featured reverse-swinging yorkers. Indeed it is because he and Headley, Waqar and Wasim, can all bowl reverse-swinging yorkers that they stand out as the leading hat-trick takers of modern times. \"I concentrate all the more now on that first ball at a batter,\" says Gough. \"People can tell him it's reversing but he doesn't know how much till he gets out there.\"</p> <p> Most bowlers at the highest level who are capable of bowling at 85mph or more are basic outswingers. Most reverse-swingers therefore make the old ball go the other way, ie into right-handers. An exception is Allan Donald, who is more of an inswing new ball bowler and reverses it away. Another, on a lesser plane, was the New Zealand fast bowler Heath Davis when England faced him in 1997-98.</p> <p> There have been two distinct forms of reverse-swing. One, popular among Australian and West Indian teams in the 1980s, was to dampen one side of the ball with sweat and thereby make it heavier. But this method has gone out of favour. As Gough explains: \"I don't like the wet theory because it makes the ball soft.\" The prevailing method now is to allow one side to become roughened up (or make it so) and keep the other side shining, as Gough does. But what exactly makes a ball suddenly start to swing one way first and then the other?</p> <p> An erudite article on the subject was written a few years ago for South African Cricket Action magazine by Clive During. His explanation was: \"When a ball approaches 135kph, the boundary layers become turbulent of their own accord: in other words, no seam is required to cause the turbulence. In fact, the seam has the effect of 'ramping' a turbulent layer off the ball. The sideways pressure is reversed; the layer on one side comes before the layer on the other side and the ball swings the other way. The idea then is to generate turbulence in the boundary layer ahead of the seam, and in order to do this the bowler has to deliver the ball at a speed of which very few are capable.\" So there you have reverse-swing. And preferably not on your toes on the line of middle stump.</p> <p><em>Scyld Berry is cricket correspondent of the Sunday Telegraph</em></p> <p>This essay first appeared in the February 2000 issue of Wisden Cricket Monthly</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the beginning there was no swing. When the first purpose-made cricket balls were manufactured in the Garden of England around 1750, they were delivered underarm and could not have swung significantly at such a low trajectory and speed. The 1890s saw the first conventional swing on a regular basis, notably from the left hand of George Hirst of Yorkshire. By the 1920s inswing was common in English cricket. By the 1950s Ray Lindwall was combining in- and outswing at will and at pace. Now we have reverse-swing to perplex batsmen and spectators alike. Just as physicists were starting to account for conventional swing with some conviction, along comes reverse-swing to be more inexplicable still. But if its causes are uncertain, its effects are not. The evolution of reverse-swing, along with the revival of wrist-spin, has stopped tailenders hanging around and brought about a higher proportion of definite conclusions in Test cricket - often in three or four days - than in the 1960s and '70s. And if reverse-swing is not an inexact science, it doesn't have an exact history either, as it has always tended to be a cloak-and-dagger subject, inextricably associated with ball-tampering. But it has evolved in the same way that all other bowling techniques have evolved. As soon as cricket becomes too much of a batsman's game, bowlers devise a new form of attack to rectify the balance; at which point the game's administrators (almost invariably former batsmen, if they played at all) step in to curb the bowlers by banning Bodyline or too many bouncers or uncovered pitches. Then batsmen dominate again until bowlers come up with googlies or slower balls or new forms of swing and the process continues its cyclical course. The first instances of reverse-swing that I've heard of date back to Pakistan in the 1940s, although no doubt the phenomenon occurred in other countries at earlier times without anyone identifying it by name. Mudassar Nazar, whose late father Nazar Mohammad also opened the batting for Pakistan, recounts that outswing bowlers in club cricket in Lahore in his father's time would come back for a second spell with the old ball and find it swinging into right-handers. A prime exponent of this phenomenon was Salim (\"Bobby\") Altaf, who played for Pakistan in the 1960s. In the West Indies in the 1950s something similar was going on. Eric Atkinson, who died in May 1998, was the key man here, a strong medium-pacer who bowled long spells at Kensington Oval for Barbados and West Indies and wobbled the old ball around in the sea breezes. The expert on this subject is Richard \"Prof\" Edwards, the West Indian fast bowler of the late 1960s who continued to do it long afterwards in Bajan club cricket for Wanderers. He still gives a fascinating lecture on reverse-swing; unfortunately, as with most lectures, when I attended Prof's in the '80s I omitted to take notes. The first major exponents at Test level were Sarfraz Nawaz, Imran Khan and Dennis Lillee. While in England for the World Cup, Imran recalled seeing Lillee reverse-swing into Pakistan's right-handed batsmen in a Test at Melbourne: that must have been 1976-77. From Australia Pakistan went straight on to the West Indies for one of the most entertaining five-Test series ever played. Their tour manager, the former Test allrounder Colonel Shujauddin, remembers Sarfraz and Imran rooming together and the ball starting to go round corners. The first time I saw reverse-swing, though I didn't know it at the time, was when Australia played a Test at Faisalabad in the autumn of 1982. Peter Sleep came in at No. 6 to face an old ball and Imran in his prime: it is a picture I can never recall without thinking of a goat being tethered as bait for a tiger. Imran charged in, leapt, and his first ball at Sleep was angled towards first or second slip before boomeranging two-thirds of the way through its flight. It then veered in towards the right-handed Sleep, pitched a full length and detonated his stumps out of the ground. Looking back (a bit like Sleep did), I realise why Imran didn't take the second new ball at Lord's in the summer of 1982 when Pakistan were desperate to finish off England's second innings (they did so just in time to win by ten wickets). The English media could not understand why Imran waited until the 117th over on a flat wicket before taking the second ball. \"Taking the new ball is such a clich\u008e,\" was all that Imran would say at the time.

      "body": "<p>\"On any given Sunday you're gonna win or you're gonna lose,\" rasps the hard-bitten coach of the Miami Sharks football team. \"The point is, can you win or lose like a man?\" Credit where it's due: the Miami Sharks lose like men. Four times on the trot they go down in a blaze of glory, a train-wreck of bodies, a shriek of bungled advice from the sidelines. But their star player (Dennis Quaid) is a few seasons past his prime, and their long-time coach (Al Pacino) is pushing 60 and team morale has hit rock-bottom. The National Football League play-offs are a few weeks away and the Miami Sharks just can't stop stinking.</p> <p>This is the kick-off point for Oliver Stone's hard-and-fast tour of the world of American Football, and it doesn't take too much to see where we're headed. That the Miami Sharks will belatedly get their act together is a given, that they will battle their way, against the odds, into the play-offs is all but assured. All that remains is to sit back and tick off the cliches.</p> <p>Accordingly, Any Given Sunday opens with a rigorous dissection of a football match gone wrong and then jumps behind the scenes to chart the ongoing spats between Pacino's old-school coach (all hoarse integrity and impassioned rhetoric) and Cameron Diaz's new-breed capitalist (a ruthless daddy's girl who's inherited the team). Paralleling the Sharks' fortunes is the rise of young-buck quarterback Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx).

      "bodyText": "\"On any given Sunday you're gonna win or you're gonna lose,\" rasps the hard-bitten coach of the Miami Sharks football team. \"The point is, can you win or lose like a man?\" Credit where it's due: the Miami Sharks lose like men. Four times on the trot they go down in a blaze of glory, a train-wreck of bodies, a shriek of bungled advice from the sidelines. But their star player (Dennis Quaid) is a few seasons past his prime, and their long-time coach (Al Pacino) is pushing 60 and team morale has hit rock-bottom. The National Football League play-offs are a few weeks away and the Miami Sharks just can't stop stinking. This is the kick-off point for Oliver Stone's hard-and-fast tour of the world of American Football, and it doesn't take too much to see where we're headed. That the Miami Sharks will belatedly get their act together is a given, that they will battle their way, against the odds, into the play-offs is all but assured. All that remains is to sit back and tick off the cliches. Accordingly, Any Given Sunday opens with a rigorous dissection of a football match gone wrong and then jumps behind the scenes to chart the ongoing spats between Pacino's old-school coach (all hoarse integrity and impassioned rhetoric) and Cameron Diaz's new-breed capitalist (a ruthless daddy's girl who's inherited the team). Paralleling the Sharks' fortunes is the rise of young-buck quarterback Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx). One assumes that Beamen is meant to embody the corrupting effect of sporting celebrity: he starts off a nice, nervous rookie, morphs into an Ali figure (all strutting charisma and political rhetoric) and then strays into simple, money-grabbing boorishness. Only Pacino, it seems, has the power to drag him back to the straight and narrow. In the meantime, Stone directs in his usual bull-in-a-china-shop fashion.
